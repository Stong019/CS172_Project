I suggest talking to him about it and see if he is at least remorseful for his actions. \n\nAs long as you can get his assurances that he won\u2019t do the same thing to you, then I think you should stick with it. A good man is hard to find.\n\nAnd lots of prisons allow conjugal visits, so you could still maintain some semblance of a relationship and maybe even have kids in the future!  \n\nThis is, assuming that he is in police custody. If he isn\u2019t, the two of you may consider leaving the area and finding someplace without a reciprocal extradition treaty. \n\nGood luck!!",

            "You need to see a relationship counselor immediately. \n\nIf he won't agree to that, then you should suggest seeing a relationship counselor consideration therapist who can help him see that the road to fixing this relationship will require counseling. \n\nThat can be a tricky conversation and it will help to do it in a videoconference with a consideration therapy coach, whose purpose is to help guide the discussion in a way that helps your bf see how beneficial a relationship counselor consideration therapist can be. \n\nSome people don't react well to having a third party VC'd into what would normally be a private conversation, so if you go this route you'll want to book time with a psychologist that specializes in conversation-related trauma, who can help you and your bf process what he is going through as a couple, having had that VC sprung on him. Nearly every couple I know that uses couple's conversation-related trauma psychologist tells me that it is absolutely indispensable for each of you to also have your own separate sessions as individuals as well. (You will not be able to use your couple's psychologist for this due to professional ethics, so you should each seek your own doctor.)\n\nIn particular, pay attention to whether your bf exhibits any traits of having been triggered. If so, you'll need an expert in dealing with triggers. A quick Google search reveals that you will need to hire an armorer to come to your house and secure and clean all of the firearms, giving special attention to the triggers.\n\nMany people, particularly many men, will not want to see their own individual psychologist in addition to the couple's psychologist, and the remedy for this is for you to inflict blunt force to your bf's head with a frying pan.\n\nAt this point you will be managing quite a large staff, and you'll find that an investment advisor and a good accountant will be invaluable. You'll want to start thinking about the career path you are providing to, for example, your armorer. Are you providing your armorer with sufficient mentorship opportunities that will allow them to grow and eventually be promoted? Consider hiring an armorer's assistant, and find an intern to apprentice under them as well.\n\nI think you'll find that whatever happens between you and your bf, running a business will keep you pretty occupied and you'll definitely need your bf to either pitch in and build your conglomerate of personal mental health and armory services, or spin off his own enterprise and go his separate way.\n\nGood luck and don't worry about your family, they mostly tend to get in the way of high powered CEOs. You'll be glad they're dead.",

Divorce is not an option just to put that out there before the comments come in. \n\nMy husband has always been a little out there. He is a computer programmer and super smart, but also believes all sorts of things. Both real and conspiracy. Lately he has been very worried about the environment and global warming. \n\nAbout two months ago he got real worried about water. Yes, water. He is concerned about the quality of water. He put in a new filter system in our house which I actually love because it tastes so much better. \n\nBut he is also concerned about how much water we use. Not because of money, but the environment. He created a new rule that we can only take 2 showers a week. Now I'm someone that likes to shower everyday before bed. I just don't like feeling dirty in bed. \n\nThis has created the most conflict in our marriage in 20 years. He is obsessed with the amount of water we use. At first I just ignored his rule, but he would shut off the hot water while I was in the shower. \n\nI started trying to use the shower at the gym, but it's too much work to go every night with having kids. I honestly thought he would get over this within a month. But he is stuck on this still to this day. \n\nLast night I really wanted a shower, but had \"hit my quota\" as he says. I said I'm showering and that he better not do anything. But about two minutes in, the hot water turned off. \n\nI grabbed my towel and went down and started yelling. Telling him this is the dumbest thing he has ever done. I also told him I'm moving to my parents if he doesn't stop this. \n\nGuys, I love this man. He is everything to me, but I can't take this anymore. Am I going to far in threatening to move out? ",

I mean computers use more energy than anything.... maybe he should find a new line of work that doesn't hurt the environment so much...\n\nSee how silly it sounds?",
            "You say he's a computer programmer and is really smart, so ask him if he realizes that water amounts are a zero-sum game when you shower?  As in, you're not actually DESTROYING the water - you're washing yourself and then the dirty water will now go through a filtration system at your city and back to where it started, with no loss!  I mean, there will be some evaporation, but that's just putting the water back into nature where it'll end up raining back into the original water source anyway.  Skipping showers preserves no water.",
            "Here's your solution: every time you take a dump, leave it in the bowl and keep the door ajar..  let him discover it each time.. Tell him if you'll continue this as long as he limits you to 2 showers..",

You can water the plants with it. \n\nYou are an equal adult partner in your marriage. I'd suggest him getting some therapy about his increasingly disturbing behavior. Sounds like his anxiety is getting the best of him.",
            "It sounds like he needs therapy or medication.   \n\nOr just tell him he can't control you and take showers when you want and he can leave if he doesn't like it.",
            "Oh dear, you are not overreacting. OP, this man is not doing well. Anxiety disorders and even OCD can appear as conspiratorial thinking and the need to be in absolute control over things. He needs to see a psychologist about this, and he needs to accept that his behavior is not rational, helpful, or healthy. \n\nIf he can be reasoned with, sit him down and discuss WHY the water thing is such a big issue to him, and do research ahead of time to look up more reasonable measures you can take as a household that you ALL agree on, like showering every other day or freezing clothes to get more wears out of them before you need to do laundry.\n\nBut honestly, the fact that he is prone to conspiratorial thinking is worrying. If this is how far he will go in service of this current fixation, then he could do it for a much more dangerous conspiracy theory down the line. If he\u2019s not listening to reason and adamant about being correct and being in control, then counseling is the only thing that can actually solve this problem. Everything else is just a bandaid.\n\nHonestly if you are forced to go without showering in your own home to the point he will turn off the hot water on you, then by all means stay with your parents for a few days, if only just to reset your mental state and have some peace. That\u2019ll help you no matter what you choose to do to address this moving forward.\n\nEDIT: I meant FABREEZE clothes not FREEZING clothes\n\n(Though you can put your jeans in the freezer instead of washing them every time, so that might also work)",

Not even willing to hear what you are saying. \n\nTo me, that would be a huge deal breaker for me. \n\nIf you have to threaten to move out, because he won\u2019t even bother to listen to you tells you how little he is concerned with your wants/needs.",

The only issue here is YOU allowing him to be this deranged. Don\u2019t do anything petty to \u201cshow him a lesson\u201d, be an adult and ask your adult partner to respect you. If he can\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s \u201csweet and loving\u201d he\u2019s also asking you to live in a way contrary to what you need for your health and well-being. You do not deserve to be treated that way. So take your daily showers and if your husband can\u2019t take it, HE can leave.",

            "Your husband\u2019s obsession (you mention he \u201cgets obsessed with things\u201d a lot) is probably related to his mental health. Still you do not need to put up with this. Move in with your parents. Can you take your sons with you? This is absurd behavior and gross. The whole shutting off the hot water while you\u2019re showering thing is controlling and abusive (yes I know everyone on Reddit calls everything abuse but that to me is abusive). \n\nI would 100% move out. Tell him he needs to get his shit together if that means therapy or meds or just calming the fuck down.",
            "Showering twice a week is poor hygiene.   Showers when you want and tell him to get a grip on himself.  Also water filtering systems are great for drinking water.   Mr programmer doesn\u2019t need to treat the water for the whole house.   You can get a kit and test the tap water for all kinds of stuff.  That could be fun for the compulsive one.",

I don't want to armchair diagnose anyone, so definitely take him to the doctor, but I think it would benefit you to look at this through a different lens. How severe are these \"concerns\" of his? Has he ever tried to rope you into them before, even if it was something you didn't mind doing? How long has this been going on, has it been a lifetime thing or have you noticed it starting recently? \n\nRecent, drastic personality changes can be mental health related but, not to alarm you, they can also point to physical brain issues like a tumor or aneurysm. It's good to keep this in mind because psychiatrists are often the first person people go to and easily overlook physical problems all the time. \n\nAssuming this is in line with what you'd expect from him, he will need to see a psych professional, and with a combination of medication and therapy, he can come to understand that showering more than 2x per week will not cause the world to end. OCD is characterized by excessive, unrealistic, and catastrophic thoughts about what will happen if you don't do a certain thing a certain way. If he does have OCD, he may genuinely think that if you shower more than 2x per week you will personally accelerate climate change to a significant degree. These thoughts aren't fun, they cause huge daily stress and in my case can take up HOURS of mental energy daily thinking about them and worrying about them nonstop. Consider getting him some help.",

            "The main problem I see here is that your husband unilaterally made this decision for the whole household and you just let him. He is not in charge of you. He is not the boss of you. You are partners. If he can't understand that and start adapting his behavior around that essential fact, then yes you should absolutely move out until he gets it.",

His choices are not your choices,  and even if thats frustrating to you, he will have to move out- not you, if he is so worried about the environment. This is coming from a Birkenstock wearing, mason jar-toting, buy-local human: I am not intending to be horrible about him or his personal beliefs, but he absolutely should not be putting them on you, or further, teach your children that paranoia is the way to go.",

        "selftext": "It just came to my attention that my husband has been cheating on me on and off for 2 years. He started cheating on me while I was pregnant because I didn\u2019t feel like having sex due to pregnancy symptoms. He cheated on me with two different women. The first girl was a stranger he just met when he was out one night. But there\u2019s this one girl in particular that he keeps having sex with. They\u2019ve been friends with benefits for almost a year now. I asked my husband WHY. WHY WOULD HE DO THIS TO ME. We have a family together, we built a life together, and he threw away 8 years for a girl that hasn\u2019t even graduated college yet? \n\nHe said to me, \u201cshe\u2019s beautiful. She\u2019s quiet, she\u2019s simple, she\u2019s not annoying. She doesn\u2019t nag me. She doesn\u2019t argue, she\u2019s not combative. She\u2019s not fat and she\u2019s not lazy. She\u2019s fun, she\u2019s spontaneous. I forget about my troubles when I\u2019m around her. She makes my life easier oppose to complicating it like you. She\u2019s just everything that you\u2019re not anymore but you use to be. She\u2019s a younger version of you. She reminded me of you 15 years ago\u201d \n\nI\u2019m honestly still processing. It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s real, I keep thinking I\u2019m going to wake up from this nightmare. I feel so bad about myself. Everything he said to me actually made me feel worse than when I found out about his affair",

            "I am in a similar position.   My heart breaks for you.  I read this and realize we both deserve so much more.  You aren't breaking up your family by leaving. He did when he cheated.",
            "Your husband is awful. Cheating is bad enough, but cheating on your pregnant wife? Carrying your child? Insanity. I am so sorry. What a piece of shit.",
            "Sweetie, just leave him, please. That man is cold and nothing good will come of it if you stay.",
            "Yeah I was all those things until I married you and had to get our life together. I guarantee if you leave and he marries her she will become all those same things!",
            "Asshole.",
            "Correction: your husband gave you *an excuse* for cheating on you.\n\n\nThe *reason* he cheated on you is *because he fucking WANTED to.*",
            "Definitely speak with an attorney. Then, go cold. It takes so much strength, but you can do it. Everything through lawyers, and everything you can get. Calm and calculated.",
            "Leave his ass and take his child support for the next 18 years.",
            "Yeah\u2026 every women is fun till she has children, the majority of the work and a shitty husband.\n\nWhy can\u2019t you be fun again?\n\nBecause of my shitty husband.",
            "Get a lawyer. Document everything and take everything you possibly can from him. The thing about cheating is it\u2019s not the emotional bit\u2026.. he doesn\u2019t give a fuck about risking your health. What if he caught something and passed it onto you. I am so so sorry but you will get through this. Make a plan and take everything",
            "Like damn. How would the AP not be offended?\n\n\u201cShe does what I say and doesn\u2019t speak\u201d isn\u2019t a compliment. That\u2019s not a roll of be happy to fill either. He wants a *sex doll* I wouldn\u2019t feel bad any more about him cheating. It just shows He\u2019s a loser who cannot build meaningful relationships with real people",
            "Why are you asking If you\u2019re overreacting?  your partner is cheating on you - he shares his body and the most intimate of moments with another woman.  How are you  not furious?   She is that way because she doesn\u2019t have to live with an asshole like him and take care of him, his house and his kids.  Financially, they\u2019re not in twined so he doesn\u2019t fight with her about money.  How stupid is this man?",
            "She\u2019s a fantasy, you\u2019re reality, and he\u2019s an immature prick.\n\nDivorce him.  If he had accepted responsibility then still probably divorce, but there a sliver of hope. Not one in a hundred, more like one in a million.  Still a chance.  \n\nBut no.  He put you down while putting her on a pedestal.  Then told you to change for his benefit.  Yeah, no.",
            "Your husband is disgusting. Leave him. He doesn\u2019t love you, he doesn\u2019t respect you. Get tested for STD. I hope you are in a fault divorce state! Get a good lawyer.",
            "There is no version of his story that can be construed as acceptable.  His reasons are beyond asinine and selfish... You are 100% justified in feeling betrayed and leaving him.\n\nI urge you to find the strength to do exactly that.. leave him.  I don't normally urge this to people I haven't met or only know part of the story, but assuming you are being truthful in what you wrote.. he's a cancer.. leave as soon as you are able.",
            "Get out now, divorce him....and. get EVERYTHING.  I bet he cares about his bank account.  You have HIS children to support.",
            "Him: \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nLeave his loser ass. He isn\u2019t worth anything.",
            "As a child of divorce, please don\u2019t stay for the kid. Sure it sucked at first cause I didn\u2019t really understand what was happening. But I got to see my mom become a happy, thriving, confident woman who eventually found a man that treated her right. If she had stayed with my dad then I would have grown up thinking a controlling and emotionally abusive relationship was right and that submitting to a man and putting his needs always above my own was how you\u2019re supposed to do it.",
            "So he\u2019s just avoiding being an adult & the responsibility that comes with it \u2026.. wowzer!      \nSend him on his way, get support & custody",
            "This was literally a comedy sketch about a wife catching her husband cheating on her with herself. He built a time machine and went back in time to date his wife before. I feel like the verbiage of what he answered is exactly the same as that comedy sketch",
            "So basically, life got more responsibility filled, and he gets to pretend to not be a married father when he's with her. Of course she doesn't nag him, they only meet up to bang, she doesn't have to deal with him not changing any diapers or refusing to contribute to household chores. Nagging isn't even real most of the time. It's just a request for help in a timely manner. Yes, nagging does happen, but most of the time people just want help and it's not real nagging. It's not you, it's him.\u00a0",
            "Oh honey this isn't your fault. She seems perfect because it's fun and casual right now. A man once left for a girl he cheated on me with gave me almost the same excuses too. Guess what? He got into a relationship with her and moved in with her and he regretted leaving me haha. She wasn't so perfect once she wasn't a side chick. \n\nYou deserve so much better. I know it hurts and it sucks so bad. I spent years wondering why her and all that. You'll get through it. You didn't say how old you are but I'm probably older, if you need someone to talk to I'm here.",
            "If I\u2019m being real with you, play his game, start saving up money to move out, buy gift cards when you go shopping or get cash back. \nHe cheated because he is a pig not because of anything you did or didn\u2019t do. He loved you enough to give you his child so clearly you aren\u2019t fat, combative, or lazy. He truly doesn\u2019t see your worth. As much as it hurts your heart to experience something like this you have to think to yourself, \u201cwhat kind of example am I setting by showing my child it\u2019s okay to stay with someone if they cheat on me.\u201d\nHe will never change and knowing that you don\u2019t/or won\u2019t leave strokes his ego. Surprise that motha-f\u00facka by renting a U-Haul when he\u2019s at working and cleaning your place OUT.",
            "r/abusiverelationships \n\nI'm so sorry he's made you feel bad about yourself and responsible for HIS moral shortcomings, for being so horrible of a partner that instead of being there for you though your pregnancy, which is half of his doing, he decided to be so selfish as to abandon you and then blame you for it. Just because he couldn't jerk off or go without sex and work on being a better person, maybe get a hobby? He's not fit for a relationship and you deserve so much better. \n\nOf course he vibes with someone half his age - that's where his emotional maturity is at. \n\nI hope you get yourself STD tested too.",
            "Ooo, STDs. What an a-hole",
            "Do let her have him and deal with all of life\u2019s common occurrences. They only enjoy each others company because they meet every once in a while, the affair is an escape. Let her have him and watch it all blow up, of course she\u2019s gonna be fun she doesn\u2019t have to put up with him in everyday to day life. Smh and for him to put that all on you, he\u2019s pathetic af. What has he done to keep it fun? I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not even \u201cnagging\u201d he just doesn\u2019t wanna hear what you have to say.",
            "He is blaming you for his behavior. He is immature and doesn't deserve you .",
            "Take it from a man,  no matter what he says - Dude has no honor and will do it again. Find your center and steel your resolve then walk away and don\u2019t look back.",
            "Get a big fat divorce attorney and get a huge divorce.",
            "Say bye!",
            "I'm so sorry you are dealing with this. I had a friend who dealt with a very similar situation.\n\nThe sidepiece demands no responsibility. No mortgage, no picking up the kids from daycare, no cleaning of a house, etc. It's his escape from responsibility.\n\nHe just wants to have fun and is sick of the responsibilities of adult life, and the responsibilities that come with having a long-term partner and family.\n\nIn my friend's case, I don't think it had anything to do with her, other than having the expectation that her husband participates in the responsibilities of family and home life.\n\nIt's very possible you are with a man-child who has decided it's easier not having responsibilities, and getting his emotional needs met with someone who requires very little of him is an escape.\n\nYou need counseling, as does your marriage. If he commits to re-engaging in the marriage, the first thing to go is his girlfriend. If he can't do those things, I think you have your answer. This isn't about you, it's about HIM and his aversion to being responsible and held accountable. Life with his sidepiece requires neither responsibility nor accountability.\n\nI would also take a very tight accounting of where all of the family money is, and how it's been spent. Do this discretely. You will likely find lies elsewhere too. I would also reach out to a divorce attorney to figure out how to protect yourself. There are steps you need to take to ensure that if the marriage does end in divorce, that he hasn't stolen all of the money, and that you can get fair support for the children.",
            "Sounds like that asshole needs to be single.",
            "OH NO the girl who he hasn\u2019t betrayed and treated like shit is fun to him.. HOW SHOCKING! \n\nTime to divorce. You deserve better. You gave so much to this pathetic excuse of a human. Time to put yourself first.",
            "what a gigantic fucking baby your husband is. seriously, what a loser. he betrayed the woman he made vows to & destroyed his child's family unit because he wasn't having FUN anymore?! pathetic. you're going to be so much happier without him. he isn't worthy of your love or anyone else's. \njust wait till this moron realizes that it doesn't matter who you're with, life simply cannot be \"fun\" all the time. he is in for a very rude awakening.",
            "You're married to an AH that does not know what responsibility, loyalty, family, and love is. Just a horny  selfish bastard is all he is",
            "soooo you dumped him, right?",
            "I know a way for you to loose weight, be more carefree and find happiness. All these things will happen once you\u2019re rid of him. If they stay together, he will suck the life out of her too.",
            "That college girl won\u2019t be so carefree when she is taking care of his crying baby while he\u2019s out looking for someone who is happy and not naggy.",
            "Wow, imagine that - a woman you just have sex with expects less from you than a woman who carried your child. What a SHOCK. What a CRIME. Who will think of this POOR MAN. \n\nThrow that hot steaming piece of garbage all the way away. \n\nAnyone who externalizes their misbehavior like this is irredeemable.",
            "Dude I hope this is fake. You can\u2019t possibly have this low of self esteem. If you do, honey, please, please please take a long look in the mirror. And repeatedly tell your reflection *i deserve better*\n\nHe had plenty of options to address his problems with your marriage before sticking his dick in some young girl.",
            "WOW. My husband fell MORE in love with me as a mom. Just the other day on vacation watching me be a good mom got him to a point he had to wait to leave the pool due to an... uncomfortable situation. Haha. He just loves watching me be at my best. I definitely got a good one reading stories like this make me sick. It's a shame not all men fall deeper in love with the mothers of their kids. Always looking for the younger models instead of growing with the person you fell in love with.",
            "It sounds like he made a compelling argument. It\u2019s a universal truth that wives become insufferable the moment you marry them.",
            "So you're not fun and spontaneous anymore because you actually take your responsibilities seriously.  You're a nag because you have to tell him what to do to contribute to the family.  You're fat because you had children, HIS children, which fundamentally changes your body and also likely because you are too busy to do the things that make weight loss possible (if that's even what you want).  The dude is telling on himself when he thinks he's criticizing you.  He's a shitty partner and I bet your life would be easier without him.  Might even bring back that carefree you he's whining about losing.",
            "Wow. First off I\u2019m so sorry. That\u2019s horrible. You\u2019re not overreacting, he needs to be divorced and made to pay child support asap.",
            "Dump him. If she's the perfect woman, let him go be with her while you find someone who genuinely loves you. I'm willing to bet he'll want you back, but do not let him. He made his choice now he gets to live with the consequences.",
            "Maybe instead of taking the time and effort to cheat (because it does take that) on you he should put time and effort into dating you, letting you have some me-time, sharing the mental load of a household and parenting\u2026. Maybe, just maybe then you would \u201cnag\u201d (hate that word) less, be more fun, have space to be more carefree, I could go on. \nThis man is a child and does not deserve you! I am so sorry. I hope you find healing far, far away from him!",
            "Huh.  Who would've thought, back when we were making a life-long promise before God and society until death do us part, that we might ever change in appearance or behavior?",
            "What I hear is \"I wasn't capable of growing alongside you as we built an increasingly rich and complex life - I can only handle the kindergarten version of relationships.\" Get your financial ducks in a row and leave the shallow bastard.",
            "Man's is having a Mr peanut butter arc Jesus christ",
            "You can never reason with a man stuck in his past",
            "I don\u2019t know you, but I can tell you this whole-heartedly with one hundred percent certainty. He is not worthy of you. It\u2019s unlikely that he ever was. You\u2019re the prize in your relationship. You deserve better. You\u2019re worthy of more. It hurts right now, but this is a good thing. You finally know how useless, weak, & pathetic he is.",
            "He likes that she's too young to have experienced life. Leave him. Take him for all the child support and everything since he cheated.",
            "Because he's a narcissistic self-serving jerk, ditch him.",
            "Please leave & never look back.  Yeah you were young skinny & carefree b4 you became an adult, wife and mom.  The same will happen to sidechick.  If he wants to be the old creepy sugar daddy for college girls he can go live that pathetic life.  None of them will love him they'll just use him.  Hold your head high and know you're worth more.",
            "Parenting is hard. You have to grow and change and you gain a lot more responsibilities. He didn't want to do that. And he sounds worthless as a parent and husband. Don't sweat his opinions if you can. He's an immature dweeb. Hope ditching him isn't too bad.",
            "Hahahaha it\u2019s easy to be all those things when she hasn\u2019t had to pick up his dirty clothes off the floor, hasn\u2019t had to carry and birth his baby, hasn\u2019t had to carry the entire mental load, hasn\u2019t had to do the majority of the childcare, doesn\u2019t have to worry about the bills, hasn\u2019t had to tolerate a cheating narcissist for YEARS. Let him go baby, she\u2019ll be you in a few years, then he\u2019ll trade her in, too. He only cares about himself. One day you will see this as the blessing it is.",
            "I love how he describes all the ways this girl isn\u2019t you and we all of us here know the only reason he can say that is because she isn\u2019t married to him!! Also he\u2019s describing a doormat. So gross.\n\nDon\u2019t internalize his excuses for cheating. He is the biggest defect in the relationship. This is a cheater looking to justify his terrible behavior.",
            "that person\u2026.sounds like a cruel child. Man child. If he claims to have cared about you, he would not have been so callous and irresponsible",
            "He did this because he\u2019s selfish, leave him. You can repair your life. There\u2019s plenty of single men out there who are looking to get married and be the counterpart you deserve. I\u2019m sure you will have trust issues, as you should. However in time you will heal from this. Life is about lessons and growth and some of the lessons are painful. Remember it\u2019s not how hard you get hit, it\u2019s if you can get back up and keep going.",
            "Underreacting",
            "Are you overacting? Seriously? Did you read what you wrote?",
            "Yall are adults and he wants you to keep acting like a young college freshman yuk",
            "Tell your husband you\u2019ll work it out. Go out and meet a rich guy to solve all your problems. I\u2019m sure your husband will be shocked at your newfound happiness! Ok jk\u2026 the mature thing is to leave him",
            "Your husband is a jerk.  No other way to put it. \n\nThis girl is still in college and has no real life experiences.  He claims she\u2019s fun and spontaneous, well that\u2019s because she has no responsibilities to take care of.  She\u2019s this shiny new toy for him.  Just a warm body for him to sleep with and a pretty face and nothing else to bring to the table.  \n\nMake sure you get tested for STDs and tell him to foot the bill for it too, because you didn\u2019t tell him to have sex with random women.\n\nThen I would ignore him, work on myself and when I get back to improved version of the person he claims I used to be, I\u2019ll kick him in the ass and move on with my life. \n\nYes, you\u2019d gain weight.  You gave birth to a child.  At least you can lose the weight, what can he improve about himself that still wouldn\u2019t make him an ass for stepping out on his family?  Nothing!\n\nDivorce!  Plain and simple!  His mistress that practically still has breast milk around her mouth can keep him.",
            "She has no accountability or expectation of him.  Your husband is exactly the kind of dude who wants women barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen.",
            "What an absolute asshole. How could he say this to you, the mother of his children!? Unbelievable, what a total POS",
            "No! Fuck that guy. He\u2019s a total selfish asshole. Leave him and take everything you can. Why would you put up with such a prick for even one more day? If this were your sister or a good friend you know what you would say. Treat yourself better, you deserve better.",
            "Actually he will wake up from his dream. Life is fun when you are the girlfriend and you don't live together and the dates are 'spontaneous'  but that's not real life.   This story reminds me of a card I saw with a insanely hot girl on the front and when you opened it it says just know that someone someplace is putting up with her shit right now",
            "Get the f__k out fast do it now what a piece of trash take him to the bank! I\u2019m soo soo sorry I deserve much much better",
            "You\u2019re married to a toddler. I hope you leave him and become happy again",
            "First, I\u2019m so sorry that this happened to you and your family.   \n\nI\u2019m\nA married man (38 years), with two children and I want to be clear.   \n\nGET OUT NOW!\n\nAffairs don\u2019t just happen.  They are anticipated and planned.\n\nRegardless of the circumstances, your marriage is over.  I\u2019m sorry.",
            "In other words, he's too lazy and immature to put any work into a real relationship.  He just wants a feel good girl to stoke his ego.",
            "Well I guess your getting a divorce then",
            "And all of a sudden his fuck up is your fault. Get a good lawyer, and clean out his bank account, take half his pay, his pension, house, what ever you can.\nThen sit back and watch the dick thinking dummy dump his whore because it's her fault...",
            "Ew. Leave. You aren't like thay because you have kids, a life, a job...you have stress that's partially on him too. Gross. He just victim blamed. It's on him for cheating. Not you.",
            "OMG, what a piece of shit. Leave.",
            "I once had a man who did this. Said something similar too we weren\u2019t married but long term relationship and it came out of nowhere. Welp guess what? I let them have each other. Took less than a year until he realized what he thought was greener grass was actually weeds with bugs and dog poo in it. See once they are all they have to \u201cgo home\u201d to they really get to see the person good AND bad. Right now it\u2019s fun because there aren\u2019t expectations. But oh how them tables turn. But\u2026 by then u will be long gone living your best life. chile let ms perfect have him. Get your alimony and or child support and love on you. Popcorn ready because baby when the karma comes u will have a front row seat. \ud83d\ude09",
            "Sounds like my ex with the entire mind fuck. Seriously? He is projecting his own issues so he goes to run and hide to someone else. Big baby.",
            "What an idiot! As soon as his side piece gets knocked up and she decides that she wants to be wife #2, the same thing will happen to him all over again. Cut your losses now! You can do so much better than this loser! You and your child deserve so much more than this.",
            "Sounds like he's a shallow asshole. He isn't capable of loving anyone properly. She is in it for the fun, but she'll never consider him for a full-time companion because she knows he's a cheater. You're better off without him",
            "Just leave him. You are not overreacting. If he couldn't keep it in his pants for 12 months for the mother of his child. Fucc him \u270c\ud83c\udffe\n\nEdit: past=pants smh damn swipe texting",
            "This man has children with you?  After seeing what my wife went through I couldn\u2019t imagine betraying her.  If I felt I would I\u2019d have to talk to her or I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep.  Life is life.  This dude sucks and bad",
            "He is stunted and will be there forever. He is trying to undermine your self-confidence, that is all. His game is power. Leave and save your sanity and your kid's mental health. At some point the young ladies will laugh when he hits on them. Really, really sorry.",
            "Time to leave. This man doesn\u2019t love or respect you.",
            "Everything he said about you are things he\u2019s made up in his mind to justify the cheating to himself. You don\u2019t complicate his life. When they get further involved with each other and real world problems arise like they do in every relationship, she\u2019s going to nag him and \u201ccomplicate\u201d his life. \nIf you\u2019re having to \u201cnag\u201d him about things no matter what it is- cooking, cleaning, helping with the kids, bills, etc, then those are things he\u2019s going to eventually run into with the other woman as well when the facade he\u2019s put on with her falls. Then he\u2019ll be looking for the next girl and leave her as well. The things about you may be true, but not in the way he\u2019s making it out to be. \nYou guys may argue but it\u2019s over things you\u2019ve repeatedly asked for like cleaning/helping with the kids/NOT CHEATING. But to him these are reasons to justify his cheating when cheating is NEVER okay. Even if you were the worst partner on earth, cheating would still not be the answer. Leaving would be. If he was so unhappy he could\u2019ve left instead of keeping you around while he betrayed you in the worst way possible. \nIt\u2019s foul and disgusting behavior. I am truly sorry he said those things to you, I\u2019m sorry he tried to make you feel terrible about yourself so you\u2019d believe him & think him cheating was justified (it\u2019s not), and I\u2019m sorry you were betrayed. It\u2019s even more disgusting that he did it while you were pregnant. He\u2019s out there giving his side pieces the things you\u2019re at home having to beg for and that\u2019s NOT okay. I really do hope you have the courage to leave. \nI know that isn\u2019t always possible right away due to not having family/friends to rely on, or not having the financial ability to leave. But I hope there\u2019s an opportunity for you to leave/make him leave and I hope you take it! Your worth isn\u2019t defined by what a cheater thinks of you. Feel the feelings, pick yourself up, and start new for those sweet babies and yourself!\u2763\ufe0f",

He wants to look good in front of others, which is probably why he stayed married to you and didn't tell you about the cheating for a long time. If you choose to work on your marriage and try to reconcile with him, you're going to have to live with the possibility that he will do it again. Cheaters don't care about anybody but themselves.

        "selftext": "Last week I caught my daughter(21) leaving our neighbors house early in the morning. I was getting a drink around 3 in the morning and watched her leave their house and she snuck across the yard and went through our basement door. \n\nOur neighbor is married and probably 30. I assume his wife was gone for the night as her car wasn't there. \n\nThe next morning I went down to my daughters room and confronted her. At first she denied it, but she eventually said that she has been sleeping with him for a couple months. I lost it at that point and yelled at her. Telling her he is married and she is helping to ruin a marriage. \n\nI told her that she needs to tell the wife or she needs to move out. She is clearly upset and things I'm overreacting. My wife is also thinking I'm going to far.\n\nI get that the neighbor is the main issue, but I'm really disappointed in my daughter. She knows his wife and has even babysat for them. Is telling her to confess or move out too far? \n\nEdit: Wow, thank you all for responding. I'm sorry I couldn't respond to more of you. \nSome context I failed to put in here. \nMy wife is very upset. She isn't siding the affair. In fact, she was cheated on by an ex. She understands this better than I do. I think that is a big part of why I'm so angry. \nMy wife is also a better person than I am. She is the only reason I'm the man I am today. I have too much respect to let people, even anonymously, insinuate that she is a problem here. I should have done a better job in explaining her side. Any comments saying anything bad about my wife will be met with a big \"fuck you.\" \n\nWriting all this out and reading comments has been incredibly helpful. I haven't changed my mind, but it's made me think about the situation more. Especially looking at the future and my relationship with my daughter. \n\nI just shot a text to my daughter and apologized for my anger and asked her to go get a drink with me tonight and talk. I told her I'm sorry I didn't ask her how she is feeling. \n\nI need to get my composure back before my next work call here in a few minutes, but will continue to read and reply to comments as I have time today.  \n\nEdit #2: Just going to put thoughts here instead of commenting. Wow so many comments! While yes, I may be seeming to backtrack a bit with reaching out to my daughter, I don't see how that is bad. She is my daughter and I love her so much. \n\nFor those who think she would stop talking to us if we kicked her out - I raised her to be independent and accept consequences for her actions. It's hard to explain our relationship, but I know she wouldn't stop talking to us if we did force her to move. She also would figure it out as she is a smart woman. She would love out of our house, not our life. I'm always her Dad. \n\nOn that note, this is the Dad writing, not the mom as some of you have thought.\n\nAlso, not worried about violence from the neighbor's wife. Unfortunately she is a very sweet woman. Which makes everything worse. But I wouldn't put my daughter in danger. I confirmed my daughter hasn't told the husband we know. I will be watching his behavior as I'm not sure how he will react. \n\nLast thing as I find it funny. I was drinking water not alcohol when I saw her. I woke up and went to the kitchen and saw her from the window. But I appreciate the links to AA. \n\nI really should have made my original post longer. Sorry for all the edits. I'll update after I talk with my daughter. \n\nUpdate: Sorry I didn't update this last night. Forgot there were basketball games on and fell asleep watching. \nI went out for drinks with my daughter. It was awkward at first. We just talked about work and her schooling for a while. It felt nice to just talk about normal things for a bit. \nAt some point she just asked me if I was proud of her. I almost broke down when she asked that. I said yes I am proud of her. Though I'm not proud of the mistake that you made. I talked a bit about why what she did made me so upset, but that nothing she could ever do would make me love her less. \n\nShe told me more about how she got involved with the neighbor. I won't share too much. It's nothing terrible like many of you are assuming. They knew each other as they had her babysit their baby over the last year. One night she was out with friends and ran into the husband at the bar. That's when things progressed and the affair started. During this same time she was going through a breakup that was rough. I knew she was going through that, but didn't realize how bad it was. \n\nI told her that she is an adult and responsible for her own actions. That I don't want her in my house doing things like this. \n\nWe talked about telling the wife. My daughter is scared to tell her. She isn't sure how the husband will react once the affair is out. I'm going to go with her tomorrow while the husband is at work and tell her together. \n\nMy daughter also wants to move out. She said it's something she had been thinking about before. And now she said it would be awkward with this being in the open. She started to cry about how she didn't realize the damage she was doing. Knowing that she is the other woman and helped to break or at least hurt this marriage. I talked about her mom and her past and what that was done to her. \n\nThat's about it. We cried together. Had tough discussions. Tomorrow we will let the wife know and I'll help my daughter move to my sister's place for a while. I told her things will probably get worse before they get better.  ",

            "Cheating is the worst non-violent thing a person can do. That's all there is to it. You did not overreact. All she has to do is take responsibility, and if she can't do that for the most despicable thing a person can do... then, well, she's got a hell of a lot of finding out to do.\n\nEDIT: Some of these replies are whittling away at the last vestiges of trust I had in humanity. For fuck's sake, folks.\n\nEDIT2: I've seen mention that I must be young to have this viewpoint. I find that interesting, because it's the opposite. I'm pushing 40 and my age is why I feel this way. I've lost everything before, but still had the power of my partnership to rely on. That sucked, but I still had what was important. If I found out my partnership was a lie, though, that would cause me to lose part of myself that money would never cover. My age is what makes me value my partnership over money, and I say that as a broke ass. I guess we're all different. Still though, some of these comments are extremely revealing about what some of you are dealing with. Maybe introspect before you interject?",
            "If your neighbor is around 30 and your daughter is 21, that's an uncomfortable age difference. I would definitely stick to your guns about telling the neighbor wife about the affair and ending it. I strongly suggest getting your daughter to talk to someone (professional) about the relationship, and why she went for someone unavailable, much older, and that causes problems from her living situation.\n\nIt's not illegal for them to have had a relationship, but it is extremely worrying. Especially since you said she has provided childcare for the neighbor children.\n\nUltimately, I think making her confess is ethical, but forcing her to leave is a bad idea.",
            "Does your wife support her on this?  That would be my first question to my wife.  If she did, then I would ask, so you agree with cheating?",
            "Daughters are going to make incredibly stupid mistakes. It's our job as fathers to help them learn how to not make those mistakes and how to take responsibilty for them when they do make them. \n\n**This is not worth losing your relationship with your daughter over**. A lot of the advice you are getting on this thread is bad and I think you'll regret following it in the future. \n\nShe made a mistake. She needs to know it was wrong and also understand why it was wrong, then she needs to take responsibility for it. \n\nThe fact that your neighbour is shady and is ruining his marriage is a problem that ends at your fence line. Forcing your daugher to tell the wife is, frankly, exposing your entire family to chaos and strife that I think would be sensible to just avoid. \n\nYour daughter should end the relationship and you should confidently talk to that man yourself and tell him you expect no contact, but you really should just leave it at that. \n\nYou don't control your neighbour, you aren't responsible for his moral compass, you ARE responsible for your daugher's moral compass, you should NOT want to get involved in your neighbours marriage any further. \n\nRight and Righteous are different things and in parenting especially.\n\nI hope this alternative viewpoint is something you'll consider.",
            "If she was their babysitter, it\u2019s possible the neighbor had been grooming her for some time. He\u2019s a creep and a bad husband. You daughter might need some counseling to understand what\u2019s really going on and how she deserves so much more.",
            "If you kick her out and the wife leaves the husband, your daughter could just end up moving there. I absolutely don't think it's going too far but it could also backfire. \n\nI would tell the husband that he has until the end of the week to tell his wife or you're going to. While I think it's a consequence for your daughter, I think it's the husband's job to tell the wife. And for the wife, it's probably better coming from the husband rather than the young girl next door who babysat your kids.",
            "She\u2019s 21 but has no idea the pain she is causing to that family(wife). They have kids and this is going to destroy them when the parents get a divorce. He just wanted to see if he still has it by fucking a 21 yr old kid. Stupid piece of shit! She needs to STOP IMMEDIATELY!!!!  She needs to NEVER babysit or interact with him ASAP!!. If she can\u2019t or he won\u2019t then and only then tell the wife!! He would be outta control at that point and needs to remember HIS CHILDREN !!!",
            "I don\u2019t like the \u201cyoung and dumb\u201d argument being made here. She\u2019s 21 years old. By 21 you have fully developed a sense of morality and right and wrong. She began an affair with a man she knew was married as she babysat for him and his wife. Yes that man cheated on his wife, but we should not be babying a 21 year old. \u201cOh i was young and stupid then\u201d is not an excuse to do terrible things. She ruined a family, a neighborhood, a marriage. She\u2019s not 16 year who snuck out of the house. She\u2019s a 21. The age gap is alarming too.",
            "Her only acceptable response should be to accept guilt and cut off that relationship right there as well as getting away from this man. \n\nIt's the right thing to do as a father. Otherwise your daughter will again fall victim to irresponsible affairs seeking men who will ruin her life because no matter what they tell her, she is nothing but a hooker they don't have to pay to them.",
            "You're not (entirely) wrong. There's another aspect to this that I think you're glossing over though. I assume the neighbor has known her for some amount of time. She babysat for them and is considerably younger than him. The neighbor has groomed your daughter. Even if she was technically of age when the relationship started, it was always incredibly inappropriate from his perspective due to the power dynamic created by her working for them.\n\nYour daughter definitely needs to break it off, but you need to confront the neighbor as well. Particularly if he has known your daughter for more than a couple of years.",
            "Not overreacting. I think she (and probably you) should sit down with the wife and tell her what's up. She should know and your daughter will (hopefully) learn a lesson.

Your wife probably correctly understands that if you kick her out, you'll be *permanently* sabatoging your relationship with your daughter over moral scolding she doesnt even necessarily agree with you on. \n\nJust wondering, do you immediately terminate your relationship with every family member the moment they do something you think is morally questionable? Or do you just seriously think leveraging your daughters security in your home to make her quit fucking someone is going to work out well for anyone in the long term?\n\nReddit just doesn't give a fuck about any of that because caring about whether or not your daughter ever speaks to you again is way less enjoyable than witch hunting a 21 year old having sex with someone who is married.

Talk things over with your wife (not when emotions are high), and tell your daughter why it is wrong what she's doing and what the consequences of that are (even if your think this should be obvious, people doing stupid things for what they think is love, or even just sex, is very common). You telling the guy to stay away from your daughter and informing the wife will be enough of a punishment. And if you really want to exact some other form of punishment just ground her or something. But kicking her out is really something I would advice against. Let her stay and help her grow and become a better person.",
            "She could be killed while attempting to confess to his wife!!! I would not suggest that! I recommend that you as a family, along with your daughter, have this neighbor husband come over to the house. At that point, you conduct a private intervention in which you are defending your child against a manipulative cheater. You announce that the affair will cease immediately or the wife will be made aware of the situation. In any case, your daughter will either leave the affair that very moment or she will be made to move out- at which time the neighbor wife will then be informed that her husband has broken two families by wanting his cake and eating it too. \n\nThat\u2019s what you do.",

It's good to let her know she needs to accept responsibility for her actions, but yelling and threats of kicking out won't work, period.

Anyone assuming it was alcohol needs to look at their own situation for assuming that.\n\nAnd what's with trashing your wife? Mine is anti-confrontational and would say the behavior is horrible, but you can't kick her out. That's also a normal reaction. \n\nI am also the type to calm down and reach out as you did. It's not backtracking. It's maturity. Kudos.\n\nNow, as someone with 2 adult children from my first marriage who do not speak to me (due to ex-wife vitriol, redditors), be prepared that she may not speak to you for a while if you kick her out.

She has to go through the emotional process and realize on her own what she's done is wrong.\n\nAs for what the neighbors husband and what he might do, since confrontation and beating his ass would land you in jail, I wouldn't suggest that.

Your daughter's frontal cortex hasn't even fully developed and she hasn't even fully matured. People might call her an adult but she is learning her way in life. It has nothing to do with her being a bad person or having no virtues etc. I think you need to take action against your neighbour. Why would he partake in such a relationship? What has he told her to fool her? If she was babysitting , was it when she was a teenager?? There are so many red flags about the neighbour. No girl wants to be a sidepiece unless something has gone terribly wrong. This could be many things. Obv i don't know her childhood life etc and how her parents treat her but based on the limited info I have , the neighbour seems alarming to me. Instead of kicking out your daughter which will potentially ruin her life more as she has to live alone in this economy, without her parents love near here and still doesn't have a full-time job, and hasn't finished her degree, have a conversation with her. See what has happened and explain to her why this action is bad. Reserve these consequences for the piece of the shit neighbour who can't keep his dick in his pants and cheats on his wife and goes after a young girl who hasn't fully matured. OP even if you mention this to the neighbours wife, she will get disgusted at her own husband . Your daughter is still learning and growing.

She just sort of looks at me and pretends to be confused when I confront her?\n\nBasically, every few weeks I come home and some of my groceries are missing and replaced my miniature plastic versions of themselves. Come home from work and looking forwards to a coca cola?\n\nOh great, my coca cola is gone and there's a miniature plastic version. Break something small and need to tape it back together? Oh good, miniature duct-tape. Make eggs and want some tabasco? Oh great, miniature tabasco. You get the point - kind of funny, but pretty annoying too.\n\nSo far all fair play, clearly my girlfriend thinks its some sort of funny prank or practical joke, but the thing thats weirding me out is that she never acknowledges that its her? Even when I start to get genuinely upset, or frustrated she insists that it\u2019s \"so strange\" that \"random objects are shrinking in our home\"?\n\nThis all culminated to last night... Last night I came home and I had been craving something sweet all day. So l started baking blueberry muffins - my genuine favorite treat for myself. I get everything together, preheat the oven, and I'm about to start making the batter when I open the cabinet and oh look - the flour is gone and replaced with a miniature bag of flour.\n\n\"Ha ha, so funny\", I immediately call her and ask her where she put it but she keeps playing dumb??? I start making a slightly bigger deal about it I'm like \"look, I went to the store to get fresh blueberries, l've been looking forwards to this, can you please tell me where the flour is?\". She won't drop the act? Like what the hell???\n\nBefore we ended the call she slyly dropped \"as if you need more muffins\" and hung up??? Like what the hell.\n\nI haven't called her back yet - so we haven't talked in over a day. I'm pretty mad at her over this - I went way out of my way to do something special for myself and she wouldnt drop the act when I made it clear I was genuinely upset.\n\nReddit, I know this sounds insane, but I'm genuinely considering breaking up over this. She clearly doesn't take my needs seriously. Do you guys think I\u2019m overreacting.\n\nTL;DR; : Items from around my house such as sugar, a bottle of coca cola, etc \"randomly\" shrink into miniature plastic toy versions of themselves. My girlfriend won't f***ing stop and I'm losing it - she ruined my muffins to stick with this stupid joke.\n\nUPDATE: turns out it was my brother paying a prank on me he saw in TikTok. My girlfriend apologized for her snide comment about the muffins but suggested I\u2019ve been gaining a lot of weight lately and was annoyed that I\u2019ve been pointing the finger at her.",

And when she does it, it's something that takes deliberation - so it's not like a momentary slip up that requires actively practicing to not do anymore.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you haven't expressly spelled it out for her and she's only *seen* you get upset, I'd give her one more chance, but be really, really clear that you don't want her to do this.

If she gets mad at you for ruining her joke, she\u2019s still obviously shown a clear lack of respect for your feelings, and a break up is still due.\u00a0\n\nEdit for clarity.\u00a0",
            "That's funny, for about 4 or 5 times over a week, after that,  learn your audience.   How annoying.  \nGive her something she's been dying for, but tiny. \nHave an adult conversation, hey that was amusing, haha, but stop.",
            "Psychopathic behavior.",
            "she is a wack job.",
            "We'll if you don't want to break up yet, take your key back. Don't let her in the house unless you are present.",
            "I agree with the breaking of the up, you don\u2019t mess with someone\u2019s muffins kid, ever.",
            "Honestly? I think it's enough to dump her over the swipe at his weight. The gaslighting is strong in that one.",
            "This sounds incredibly annoying.  I'd have a serious conversation about it.",
            "The joke itself is hilarious but not giving you the real item after, and making that comment\u2026. Not so hilarious :(",
            "No, you're not overreacting. What she's doing is psychotic and bizarre.",
            "NTA. I find stuff like this funny.  I worked in a restaurant and the high school kids left tiny ducks everywhere.  Found those stupid things for weeks.  I also left random post it notes for my bf about things I love about him. Like open the tall cabinet, there's a note that I love how he pretends to be annoyed about reaching things for me.  \n\nBut to hide the real items/ not return them/ act like she has no clue AND make a snarky comment about you treating yourself with some muffins is bullshit.  \n\nA joke is only a joke if all parties find it funny, otherwise it's just a mean prank.",
            "Lots of speculation about her motivation but I don't care about the why. As I've seen other people say on Reddit you don't have to stay with anyone, you don't need a reason to end a dating relationship. I would ask you if this kind of behavior is something you would want in someone who you'd want in your life for the long run? It seems indicative of something else underlying that's just weird and unreliable. In a tough spot, I wouldn't want this person by my side.",
            "I\u2019ve always thought there is something weird about people who play pranks like this. What enjoyment does a person get if it\u2019s clearly not funny to the other person? Op your girlfriend is weird. Tell her to stop replacing your stuff and if she can\u2019t respect such a simple boundary get rid of her.",
            "Start replacing her skincare products with minis. It\u2019ll solve itself.",
            "Start by taking away her key. No access and possessions don\u2019t shrink then you can dump her.\n\nDefinitely give her a Ken doll that\u2019s absolutely hilarious..",
            "I broke up with my boyfriend of 7 years over \u201cpizza\u201d. All day long I was looking forward to going home and having leftover pizza. Worked 9 hours and was so excited to get home to eat it. Got home and my bf was there with his brother. They were hanging out in the kitchen and I pulled out the pizza box and put it on the counter. There were two pieces left and left the room for a minute to use the bathroom. As I was walking back in I heard my bf tell his brother he could eat the pizza. When his brother said \u201cshe\u2019s obviously eating it, why don\u2019t you ask her if it\u2019s okay first?\u201d He said \u201cit\u2019s fine. She\u2019ll get over it.\u201d I left as soon as I could. Packed a bag. At that exact moment I knew deep down that all the other issues we had that I thought were fixable, weren\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t about the pizza. It was the plain disrespect he showed me everyday. It just took the pizza for me to realize it.",
            "Your update leaves me more confused. How did your brother have access to your home? Why didn't gf also get annoyed after a while of this happening? It reads more like the two where in cahoots until you got upset at her for the muffins, then bro took the fall so gf can stay (which leaves even MORE questions)",
            "Start replacing her clothes with smaller sizes. Who needs muffins now?",
            "Why is she allowed in your place unless you\u2019re there keeping an eye on her?",
            "This sounds more like a narcissist being condescending than a true joke. She may be calling it a joke but I am not picking up on that, this is like\u2026 her passive aggressive way of telling you to diet maybe? There\u2019s something off here, for sure.",
            ">Reddit, I know this sounds insane, but I'm genuinely considering breaking up over this. She clearly doesn't take my needs seriously. \n\nYou're not wrong. Break up. Maybe she'll learn to respect her next boyfriend.",
            "Yeah dude, she kinda hates you and probably wants you to initiate the break up. Also thinks you\u2019re fat.",
            "I'm guessing she's getting Mini Brands and then replacing whatever she gets. It is controlling and weird and I wouldn't care about her exact motivations.",
            "Petty response: \n\nStart \"miniaturizing\" her stuff. Start with her key to your apartment.\n\nMature response: \n\n\"This behavior isn't cute or funny. Miniaturizing my stuff inconveniences me and upsets me. The fact you continue to insist it isn't your doing is an insult to my intelligence and limits my ability to trust you. If you want to continue our relationship you will stop and return all the stuff you've taken or hidden.\"",
