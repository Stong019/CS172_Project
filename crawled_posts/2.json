        "selftext": "What a crazy terrible night I had.\n\n4 years ago my wife had an affair with a co-worker. We had been married for 3 years at the time and were trying to have kids, but had fertility issues and both were having a hard time with that. I caught her because another co-worker reached out to me to let me know what was going on. We were incredibly close to divorce, but through counseling we made it through and have had a pretty good marriage over the last two years. We have a date night once a week that I plan. I bring her flowers at least once a week. Write love notes, etc. I don't want to lose her.\n\nShe left that job so that she wouldn't be around that man. Went completely no contact with him.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. We were at the gym and I was waiting for my wife to get done showering. I had forgotten my phone and home and grabbed hers to kill some time. I wasn't trying to snoop. It has been at least 2 years since I've even felt I needed to snoop. I open up instagram and start scrolling through pictures. But then I notice that she has a message. I knew it was wrong to click. Thats too far and an invasion of her privacy, but curiosity got a hold of me.\n\nIt was him. The co-worker that she had an affair with. 2 months ago he reached out to see how she was doing. I read through all the messages. There was nothing wrong with what they said. It was them catching up about life and work(he still is at old job). If it had been anyone else I wouldn't have even cared. But this was the man that helped almost ruin my marriage.\n\nI took some screenshots and sent them to myself. Waited until we got in the car and then asked her about why she is talking to him. She starts screaming that I shouldn't have looked at her messages. Saying that I don't trust her. I apologized for snooping, but told her that I want a divorce. She stopped talking to me and left the house as soon as we got home. I have no idea where she went. Even this morning she hasn't responded to me.\n\nWaking up this morning, I still believe I want a divorce. The pain of the affair was too much. I know they aren't having an affair right now. But the fact she is even talking to him is insulting to me. Especially without telling me. Am I overreacting?\n\nEdit/Update: My wife finally responded by text. She claims to have stayed at a hotel overnight. She says that I should go to my parents. I realize I forgot to mention we have a 1-year old boy. So I'll need some help with him as she said she can't talk to me right now.   \nShe said she understands why I want a divorce and won't fight it. She is looking for lawyers right now.   \nI'm not sure what to feel right now. Honestly I knew I would continue on the path to divorce, but I think part of me hoped there would be a little fight for me from her. I imagine she will probably start dating her old coworker again. I just hope she fights for our boy during all of this. She really is a good mother to him and he deserves to have her in his life. \n\nThanks all for the support. I'll keep this up and maybe have an update in the future. ",

            "It\u2019s the anger response that tells you what\u2019s up my dude. \u00a0",
            "You don\u2019t \u201ccatch up\u201d with an old affair. The important fact to remember is that her first response to his first message \u2014 I assume he initiated contact? \u2014 was *not* \u201cThings are well, glad you\u2019re fine too, but please don\u2019t contact me again.\u201d  It\u2019s also important to remember she never told you she was in contact with him again. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll say she didn\u2019t want to concern you with this piddling nothing of a matter. But it\u2019s not nothing, is it?",
            "So let me get this straight. \n\nYour wife cheats on you. You two go to marriage counseling and the outcome is that you stay together but you are bending over backwards to rekindle the intimacy in your marriage by planning date nights and sending her flowers on the regular. When you're the one that got cheated on. \n\nWhat has she done to make amends in the marriage?  What is she doing to let you know she's faithful and wants to be with you?\n\nThe absolute minimum she could have done is permanently block the affair partner on all mediums and never interact with them again.\n\nHer reaction to you finding the messages, while seemingly harmless, says it all. Those are just the ones you saw. She may have deleted some DM's or may still be screwing around on other apps.\n\nShe sees stability in you, but treats you like a doormat.  I hope you two never had kids after having the fertility issues, because the divorce is just going to be messier.\n\nHave some respect for yourself and leave.\n\nEDIT: in case my most recent reply gets lost in the shuffle.  DO NOT LEAVE YOUR HOUSE. Under no circumstances. Take a LOA from your job to care for your son. He's the most important right now.",
            "The \"Let's catch up\" messages are a tactic to get your foot back in the door. Your wife knows that and if she is entertaining it then she will eventually cheat on you again. Stop with the counseling which I'm sure was all about you working on forgiving her. Stop with the flowers and love notes.  She wants a guy to treat her like shit.",
            "She went to his place",
            "Her reaction is telling. Not apologizing, blaming? Ew.\u00a0",
            "You're not overreacting. \n\nShe GAVE you a reason to not trust her. End of story. \n\nIf she wanted to save the marriage, she would have blocked her affair partner on insta when he sent the first message. She's entertaining the idea of this guy again. This is honestly all you need to know.",
            "You know what you need to do. She\u2019s screaming at you even though she\u2019s the one who\u2019s made repeated mistakes? That\u2019s getting into gaslighting territory. Drop her immediately.",

            "I HATE with a true passion the bullshit of \u201cinvading privacy\u201d. You\u2019re married. I seriously don\u2019t care if my husband spends two days solid going through my phone. He doesn\u2019t but that\u2019s because he knows I don\u2019t care. I feel like the only people that lose their shit over privacy are the people doing something wrong. She knew she was doing something wrong AND she had an affair. Why does she think she deserves your trust exactly? You\u2019re doing the right thing. If it was truly innocent she wouldn\u2019t have cared and said she was sorry. Instead she threw a tantrum instead of showing some decency. And if she respected you at all she would\u2019ve either not responded or have only responded to say not to message her again and block him. In my opinion he should\u2019ve already been blocked.",
            "No contact is a basic rule/boundary for real reconciliation post cheating. She broke it. Time to react and file for divorce, inform your inlaws of why you are divorcing her, and mutual friends too. Protect your reputation, hers is none of your concerns.",
            ">We have a date night once a week that I plan. I bring her flowers at least once a week.\u00a0\n\nLMAO this is why couples counseling is such a goddamned sham.  She's the one who cheats, and you're the one who has to make up for it like a scolded dog.",

            "Your wife had an affair and you did everything you could to regain trust and respect in your relationship. You both moved on, mostly. \n\nThen you caught her communicating with him AGAIN and her first respondent to apologise but to attack you for snooping? \n\nYes. Divorce. She knew damn well what this was building up to. She never told you he reached out. She didn\u2019t block him or she didn\u2019t try to shut him down. \n\nJust move on",

She has already proven herself untrustworthy, and now she has violated what trust you placed in her after forgiving her (something you never should have done, you never take a cheater back, because the overwhelming likelihood is, they will cheat again).\n\nThen she screams at you about not trusting her, and the fact that you looked through her messages, which is a blatant deflection tactic to make you seem like the bad guy when she\u2019s very clearly violating your trust again. Then she runs off and spends the night God knows where (my money is on a lovers\u2019 bed). I don\u2019t know how you have an iota of trust left for this woman, but I don\u2019t think she could make her intentions anymore obvious unless she held up a giant neon sign in front of your face.",
            ">I bring her flowers at least once a week.\n\nIt loses its meaning when it becomes just a wild waste of money.\n\nAnyway you're underreacting, stop \"wanting a divorce\", you need to get a lawyer and **get** a divorce. She doesn't respect you.",
            "What did the wife do to improve the marriage?\n\nDid she plan dates?  Does she buy Op flowers?  \n\nI\u2019d have divorced her the first time. \n\nNTA",

            "If she had responded with a level head, I would entertain the idea that you may have overreacted and there's really nothing to be worried about right now. But if she really instantly resorted to blame shifting and anger, that's a pretty solid red flag. She's either already cheating again or she is definitely considering it, consciously or subconsciously.",

If she's got private info and connections that she's hiding from you and gets mad about you finding them...that's a gigantic red flag.\n\nHis 'catching up' message is just a way to sneak back into contact.  The fact that she played along, and hid it from you means that she's already moving towards emotional affair.",

            "You\u2019re in the right here. She can\u2019t be mad at you for snooping. She doesn\u2019t deserve your trust.",
            "I don't think you guys are working out . I thought she went no contact so she didnt block him on insta ? Why would she think it's ok to even talk to that man just show's she still likes him .",
            "Sounds like you are far more invested and interested in making this marriage work than she is. She left her job and stopped talking to him. That\u2019s the bare minimum. Now that she\u2019s talking to him again she is not even doing the bare minimum to maintain a healthy relationship with you. You are planning date nights, bringing flowers, writing love notes\u2026. Actively showing your investment into her and that she is a priority. What is she doing to show you are her priority? Talking to her affair partner behind your back for months. You don\u2019t know where she is. She could be with him right now. She could be alone at a hotel. She could be at a friend\u2019s place. Really it doesn\u2019t matter as she is not at your home working to fix your relationship or atoning for her betrayal. She has shown you that she doesn\u2019t respect you or your relationship, believe her. Unless she makes drastic changes to fix things (which if I was you would be near impossible as I would have already called a divorce lawyer the second she left) you have no reason to believe she has any intention of being faithful to you.",

You confronted her for having a conversation with someone she cheated with so her response is to bail out for the night and leave you to take care of your son? That says what you need to know right there.",
            "Hello, couples therapist here: So sorry this happened. You are not overreacting. Also, don\u2019t beat yourself up for looking through her phone. Do you feel like she\u2019s atoned for the affair (can see her behavior is hurtful, understands the pain it caused, and commits to not repeating the behavior)? He was the affair partner; typically when recovering from an affair there is NO contact with any affair partner. You are her husband and want to be her #1 priority. Does she understand how hurtful it is to maintain contact with someone she cheated with? If she can see that, you can work with it. \n\nIdeally she would have told you right away when he text her so you could decide together how to handle it. She kept it a secret\u2026 affairs thrive when there is low transparency/secrecy, conflict avoidance, and low accountability. You did your part when you asked her about it. \n\nYou said what they talked about wasn\u2019t the issue, it was the lack of transparency and her reaction. It\u2019s possible this could be more of a boundary issue and returning to couples therapy could be helpful if you want to save the marriage. Typically with affairs, there are underlying issues in the marriage a couple would need to explore and address. Oftentimes couples leave therapy too early before they fully address their core issues.\n\nThe betrayer experiences guilt and shame, and often builds an arsenal of defensive behaviors to protect themselves. From the outside they can look a particular way, but inside they are grappling with the being the person who betrayed their partner. \n\nTo summarize, Your hurt and pain is valid. Your need for honesty and transparency also important. If you both want to work on the marriage, it is possible to recover from this. The affair is the outcome of some underlying issue. Recovery would include addressing the affair, establishing better boundaries, and addressing the underlying core issues that have been missed. \n\nTreatment options: \n-Discernment counseling first (this is a place where a couple goes to decide which path they\u2019re going to take (Maintain the status quo, commit to couples therapy, or divorce). This is about a 5 to 6 sessions commitment. This would be a good place for you to start. It\u2019s a very short term commitment and the goal is to decide which path you\u2019ll take. The therapist is working on assessing motivation and helping both parties take responsibility for some of the underlying issues in the marriage.\n-if you decide to do therapy, seek out affair recovery: I would look for a certified Gottman therapist or emotionally focused couples therapist. You can Google search both of those; look for a therapist who is certified and also trained in affair recovery.\n\nWhat happened was deeply hurtful, I just don\u2019t want to create an echo chamber where you begin to feel like it\u2019s impossible to recover from this. Many couples recover from affairs. It depends on what you both want to do. If you feel divorce is best for you, that\u2019s OK too.",
            "Don\u2019t be weak.\n\nYour wife is a bird. \n\nLeave her as soon as possible.\n\nShe see\u2019s you as a weak man that she can cheat on since you decided to stay when you caught her.",
            "Bail on her",
            "Sorry OP.. from experience my guess is she ran off to him to see if he wants a relationship.  If he says no, she'll come back to you crying and begging forgiveness.  Don't let it be her choice \n\nGood luck.",
            "She should not be in defense mode if she has nothing to defend. Yet here we are. She\u2019s selfish and she thinks she should not be confined by the rules of marriage. This is what she is telling you.",
            "The headline says it all\u2026. What is there to talk about pal?",
            "\"I have no idea where she went.\" Lol, I have one. \n\nIf this is real, pretty common sense to do what you should've done the first time.",
            "If your wife was solid she wouldn\u2019t have cheated in the first place. Mistake 1 was taking her back after the affair. It\u2019s ok you know who she is and got a second helping of it. Now you should know for sure you can\u2019t trust her. Glad you caught her before she put his dick back inside her, but that\u2019s what she clearly is interested in. Otherwise the trauma she caused you would be unbearable to even face again and she wouldve never accepted a conversation with him bc she would be considering you, her husband, first. Instead you got taken out of the picture. I\u2019d go to a lawyer and submit evidence of her admitting to cheating in the past as well as this evidence so you can file for adultery so you don\u2019t have to pay alimony to her. Sunken cost fallacy is what you are dealing with brother.",

            "The fact she hid from you that side dude had reached out is problem A. Then going off about you don't trust her instead of apologizing and admitting that she should have told you is problem B. Basically, she was entertaining the idea of another affair even if she wasn't planning on going through with it. Even flirting eventually leads to the same result. You don't even know where she is or what she's up to is another problem in conjunction with the first two. You're not overreacting, and I would definitely move forward with a divorce. Trust is the most crucial part of any relationship, and if you don't have that then everything else will fall apart. She has not fostered trust through her actions or her reaction. I know we live in a time where you will be painted as the bad over controlling guy for expecting your wife to be loyal, but for your own well-being, move on and value yourself. You deserve someone who is loyal and honest. We all do. I hope it all works out for you.",

            "1. When you are married there is no privacy. You are all in or all out. This whole 'My social media or texts is my privacy' is a relatively new phenomenon that has done nothing but create secrets that destroy marriages. There should be nothing to hide in a text or a message, so why hide it? There are no secrets when you are married. If you can't be 100% with your partner, then you are in the wrong relationship. \n\n2. She should have shut him down immediately. 'I'm sorry, but we can never be friends. I'm 100% committed to my relationship. Don't contact me again.' is what she should have said. \n\n You are not overreacting. You gave her a chance and she blew it.",

            "Cheaters don't get to have privacy.  If they want to make it work, everything has to be an open door.

Send her back where she belongs, to the streets.",
            "Dump that bitch.",
            "You\u2019re not overreacting dude. She traumatized you with that affair, that just doesn\u2019t go away with an apology and time. For one, it is okay to decide down the line that living with the person that hurt you so badly just isn\u2019t worth it. Second, she\u2019s still talking to the guy and behind your back. She got angry because she got caught. For your own health, a divorce is a wise decision in self care. You deserve so much better.",
            "She is over reacting.  Of course you do not trust her.  She has broken all trust between you.  Personally this should be a deal breaker.  You moved past the first one.     The way she reacted should tell you everything you need to know.   \n\nBTW if I would bet a ton of money about where she is.  She was looking for a reason to be mad at you to make you the bad guy.  That way she can justify being with the other guy.  Pretty typical of what cheaters do.  If they hadn't hooked up, it was only a matter of time before they did.  \n\nYou have nothing to apologize for.   What she did is called DARVO.    Deny, Attack.  Reverse.  Victim.  Offend.  By denying their actions, attacking the person confronting them, and flipping the roles of victim and offender, the narcissist effectively redirects attention away from their own actions, often causing doubt in the victim's claims.\n\nCheaters never stop cheating, they just get better at hiding it.  \n\nIF she loved you, she would never hurt you in the manner.  Only selfish people do this.  You deserve better.  You are not one of her options.",
            "After the pain her affair cost you, the near demise of your short (at the time) marriage, and the difficult yet sincere work you put in to work through her poor choices in order to continue in the relationship with her.... You are absolutely not overreacting. Forgiveness isn't easy, neither is creating a hard boundary. Your wife should know that speaking to this man in any situation she can avoid, is cruel and unwarranted.\n\nIt's unfortunate that you wish to end your marriage - it is a big decision. So if it makes you feel any more at ease, perhaps a couple of marriage counselling sessions would help put those feelings in perspective for both of you. But ultimately, if you feel like the trust is gone, and she doesn't respect your most important boundaries, then you gotta go with what feels right.",

We first started off as friends so the foundation of our relationship is pretty strong. He is so perfect and good to me in every way a man can be good to a woman. However he can be very controlling, territorial, and because of his childhood he has a lot of trust issues. \n\nHe owns his own trucking company and sometimes is gone for days evens weeks at a time. Recently he went away and was coming back and I was excited to see him. When he came back the neighbor car was parked in my driveway ( which it never is) but I gave him permission to do so because of an event he was having at his house and our hoa doesn\u2019t allow parking on the street.\n\n When my fianc\u00e9 came home I was in the bathroom shaving and all of a sudden he came in yelling\u201d who the f*** is in the house\u201d and checking in the shower, closet, bed, ect. I remember feeling so confused I didn\u2019t even respond. He grabbed me by the arm and kept shaking me and calling me a f****** liar, and saying I was like his mom, and a lot of other hurtful things. When he found no one in the house I eventually realized he saw the neighbor car and thought I had another man there. There were also a man\u2019s boots on the steps but they were his so I\u2019m confused on how things escalated in his mind so quickly. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 fractured my arm so I had to go to the hospital. Now he is apologizing and I feel like in my mind if I marry him I am allowing him to think his behavior is ok. But another piece of me feels he is a good man.\nI have distanced myself from him since and he keeps bringing me expensive gifts, jewelry, roses, and other nonsense. I have never experienced this side of him and we have been together 2 years.\nI am so torn and don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nI am 29 female\nHe is 36 male\n\n",

Its concerning that you don't seem to realise that...\n\n>Now he is apologizing and I feel like in my mind if I marry him I am allowing him to think his behavior is ok. But another piece of me feels he is a good man.\n\nNo. He's not. Again the fact you think that is truly concerning. He saw a car parked in your driveway, immediately leapt to \"cheating\" instead of...like a visitor, a tradesman, a family member, jesus it could have been one of your girlfriends... Then despite any evidence of his delusions he physically assaulted you and broke your arm. This is not a good man. This isn't close to a good man. He's not in the same ballpark as a good man.\n\n  \nFwiw after reading the whole post. Still no. You don't marry someone who physically assaults you. That doesn't get better, that gets worse.",

        "selftext": "So basically the title. He (33M) says Im(32F) throwing away 4 years over a mistake he made.\n\nTo keep it short, on 4 different occasions over the last 2 and a half years he's gone drinking and come home to throw a drunken tantrum because I said the wrong thing, something happened at the bar, or I put my foot down because he's drunk and yelling at me in front of our friends at the bar. Twice I had to leave to my sister's house because he was going around our small apartment slamming doors and banging his head on the walls. I've had to wake him up several times because he falls asleep on the toilet or the bathroom floor, and he's had to sleep in his car because of his outbursts.\n\nOn the 2nd time this happened he gave me his word that he would be more responsible with his drinking and that he wouldn't have anymore outbursts. He said he was gonna drink waters between each beer or have sodas and bar food and just one beer. The third time I made it clear that him going back on his word was unacceptable because it shows that he doesn't care that he becomes emotionally and verbally abusive towards me. I told him I was tired of his apologies if he's gonna keep doing the same thing. Between all these times he has continued to get drunk on the weekends but I've kept my mouth shut to avoid him having an out burst and things were relatively ok. \n\nThis last time he went and got drunk at the bar, didn't eat anything, refused the water my sister offered him because she's aware of the agreement we had, and when I arrived he yelled at me because he was too drunk to keep track of what team he was on and he misunderstood me when I told him and he made the wrong shot. We went to get food from a local taco spot and he couldnt even stand because he was so drunk, I had to pull over on the freeway because he needed to throw up and when we got home he fell asleep in the bathroom and I had to wake him three times. I kept my anger about the situation to myself because the sadness of feeling like I needed to leave him because he's just not willing to change, was overwhelming. The next morning he could tell something was up and he asked if I was ok. I said that I wasn't ready to talk but he insisted, so I told him that he went back on his word again about drinking responsibly and that I realized that the only way I was going to avoid his verbal abuse was if I just kept quiet. I told him what I told my ex when I was thinking about leaving \"It's not anything I haven't already told you\". He left it at that in the morning and at night I was crying because I was upset that 4 years of my life were going down the drain, and I just folded and asked him why I wasn't good enough for him to want to do better. Then he started to say that I had fault in our relationship ending, ignoring that the only reason I'm leaving is because I can't keep giving him chances to verbally abuse me when he's drunk and angry. I reminded him that he had given me his word and that he had gone back on it twice. He seemed to understand but the next day he just kept saying that he deserves to \"unwind\" on the weekends because he works all week to provide for us (not like I have a job and am constantly sending him money because he over spends and his account will overdraft when the phone or Internet bill charge his account) i was getting whiplash from how quickly he waa going from being apologetic about going back on his word and him insisting that Im being unreasonable and unfair. I slept at my sister's house again because I couldn't keep dealing with it and I was just really emotionally exhausted from all of it. \n\nNow he posted on his FB that I'm throwing away 40,000 hours of our lives together for 12 bad hours. \n\nSo I'm asking, am I overreacting?",

He keeps crossing them regularly without any care for your well-being, and these are the consequences of his actions. \nNobody should tolerate any kind of abuse for even 1 out of 40000000000000000 hours. And for him to not take responsibility for his behavior but for trying to make you feel guilty about not wanting to accept unacceptable behavior is manipulative and potentially dangerous. \nEnding a relationship is always hard and you get to be sad about losing the good things. But you're making a healthy choice here! And perhaps, having to deal with the consequences of his actions might make him reflect more on what he's doing. Or not. But that's not on you and something you never have to take on. \nSending you healing hugs.",

Literally, I remember every big event, family get together, holiday, etc. I had to go through this.

I remember saying that if every birthday, wedding, holiday, get together was going to be like this and I had to worry if he was going to get so inebriated that he couldn\u2019t function and I had to take care of him - then I wasn\u2019t interested (let alone, having a family together on top of that). He did put in a lot of effort (after lots of fights about it) but eventually gave a lot of excuses and couldn\u2019t hold himself accountable. I think he eventually just resented me for it, for \u201cmaking him change himself\u201d and I was always the bad guy because I \u201cdidn\u2019t want him to have fun\u201d.

Notice how this situation includes zero other people or consideration for them?\n\nPeople don't like to say this, but family and children who have grown up with addicts know that they can be VERY manipulative and selfish people. They will do years of harm to their family and friends for substances and indulgence. The whole social media guilt trip angle is just one more trick in the book. He thinks he \"deserves\" to drink, no matter what it does to those around him or how bad it is for him. The only thing that has actually changed, is he has dug his heels in to insist on doing more drugs, no matter how much evidence has piled up showing how bad it is. His mindset hasn't changed at all. Only the pile of evidence showing how evil it is to stay addicted to it has grown.\n\nJust fucking leave. You're UNDERreacting. Sadly he has loved the drugs more than anything else.

            "I was in a similar relationship not too long ago, except it wasn't with alcohol. It was with pot. It wasn't until after we moved in together that I found out he was a current pot smoker (I knew he had in the past and expressed I wasn't comfortable with it). Once we moved in together and he let the secret out, I made CLEAR boundaries about the habit that I asked him to follow because it was my house too. He pushed the boundaries every single way he could. I shared with him that that was hurting my feelings that he wasn't respecting the boundaries I had set, so it lead to several fights that would start out as him being apologetic, followed closely behind him being resentful of me because pot was his way to unwind. \n\nBelieve me, it gets worse the more you let them walk all over you. Please leave. I left in just enough time before he started getting physical toward me. He punched two or three holes in the walls and doors, he took a doorcop and beat in a corner in the hallway. He would throw things at me and miss. He got mad one time in the car on the way home from the gym and ripped the car visor off the ceiling and threw it at me. He tried to lock me out of my own house when I went on a walk to cool off. He punched his computer screen and broke it when he was frustrated with me trying to help him with his math homework (even though he asked for the help). Just please, don't stick around. And don't let him guilt you. You'll find your person who will make you wonder why you ever even considered dealing with that amount of selfishness.",

My wife of 14 years dealt with my opiate addiction for the first 7 years of our marriage. I was a real piece of shit that point in my life and if she didn't love me as much as she did, I would more than likely be dead right now considering the disastrous path my life was on. My debt to her can never be repaid. I don't feel like I deserved it but I can never thank her enough for pushing me to change and being there for me when I needed her most. I recently hit 7 years of sobriety a few days before our 14th anniversary. She and our 5 year old boy are my rock and the reason I will never live that way again. Good luck in the future and I hope he finds the help he needs to be a better man. Addiction is ruthless and can make  even the best of men and women do some serious emotional and psychological destruction.",
            "I have been in a similar situation to you. I was about four years in and the drinking wasn't stopping. But when he wasn't drinking, it was incredible. A lot of the reason he was drinking was because of his stress at work. It got to a point where I urged him to leave the company, without a job, without a prospect. He did that, and he started to study for exams that he needed to take for his certification. At the same time, he saw a lot of his older brothers, settle down, start to have kids, and become more responsible as adults. That period was an amazing period of time for us. He was barely drinking, he was thinking about how to get his life together, and I loved him more than ever. Deep down I know that he is a very very good person and he wants a family. \n\n  \nThere isn't really a \"but\" to the story. Ultimately, he got his shit together once he realized that drinking like that was embarrassing. With enough time passing not drinking, his tolerance also went down so he couldn't drink as much and he had massive hangovers when he did drink. That helped him overcome it. But I think the thing that helped the most for him, and for myself was that eventually, I said to myself, this is a good person, and I'm going to commit to this person 100% through the bad times, and the good, I think that that helped to stabilize the relationship and make him feel like I never had a foot out the door. I think it helped him realize that we are going to build a life together and a beautiful one and it won't end up in a place we want to be if he continued to drink like that.\n\n  \nI tell the story because I think it's very easy for a random person on the Internet to read your story and say fuck that guy. But I know that when you're in it, and when it's been four years, it's a lot harder than that it's a lot more complicated. trust me, I have throughout my relationship said absolutely not I won't be with this person, I have said we needed a break, we have even broken up in hoping that he really feels it. But deep deep down inside, I just knew that this person was good. If you can say the same about your boyfriend, you can see progress, and if you love this person deeply, and I mean very very deeply, then, sometimes it's worth trying to help them through the situation.",

Sometimes that means giving the other person more than they might deserve at certain times.  The relationship doesn\u2019t sound physically abusive, just that there\u2019s a substance issue that needs to be resolved. Relationships get through that. Love is sacrifice; if you love each other, you\u2019ll sacrifice enough for each other to live with it.",

            "First off you are a saint for putting up with that kind of abuse.  I used to be just like your bf/ husband with a serious drinking problem.  I would always have fights with my wife and others whenever I drank too much which was at least half of the time.  I tried AA and cutting back, but deep down inside I never truly believed I was the problem.  I thought myself a rational person with good judgement and believed that any arguments I had when I was drunk were the likelihood of someone pushing my buttons or deserving of my wrath.  Even when I slept and sobered up and could see that I overreacted, I still deep down believed that someone probably set me off.  I never thought of blaming the alcohol.\n\nMy wife endured many arguments over it and held on and prayed for me.  One day we were at a friend\u2019s barbecue and I was getting blackout drunk.  My wife ended up leaving early to get up for work, but I had the day off so just continued binging.  When I got home I was so drunk I fumbled with the keys to get in the front door for like 30 mins before giving up.  I took a break a sat on the front of my car (didn\u2019t drive) to smoke a cigarette.  I finally made it in and we ended up having a massive argument.  \n\nI don\u2019t even remember what it was about, but I knew that my wife was ready to throw in the towel on our marriage.  I just kept apologizing like so many times before.  This time though she showed me a video on her phone of us arguing.  I wasn\u2019t aware I was being recorded.  She just set record and let it run for 20 mins.  \n\nI remembered bits and pieces of the night and the argument.  I remembered why I got upset, and I thought I remembered the argument in my mind, but man I was way off.  I was a totally different person, unrecognizable to me.  I remember it hitting me like a ton of bricks.  I kept asking myself who the f**k was this person in the video?  My silent thoughts were saying don\u2019t ever let anyone like this in my house, but it was me!  I didn\u2019t remember saying any of the shit that I said, but here it was right before my eyes.  \n\nIn that moment I realized that my friend my buddy my pal, alcohol had not been the trusted comrade I once thought.  It was in fact a thief.  Spirits hijacked my mind and body and turned me into the creature from Jekyll island.  I suddenly realized I had been living a lie for the last 20 years.  It was a moment of epiphany.  \n\nI convinced my wife to give me another chance with some ultimatums, and kicked alcohol to the curb.  It\u2019s been 4+ years sober now and my convictions are just as strong today as they were on day 1.  Sometimes I think back on how ridiculously easy it had been to quit drinking when I did, after having failed so many times before.  If anyone reading this is in the same boat.  First you must change your perspective.  It\u2019s not enough to have general knowledge that something is not good for you.  You must witness it for yourself.  Once your perspective changes, then your attitude changes.  Only then can your behavior truly change.  I never experience the desire to have a drink.  I actually feel sorry when I see people drunk.  I feel sorry they are still in the maze/ trap.\n\nTLDR If your bf is a good dude sober, then he needs to see himself raw on camera while he\u2019s drunk while the spirits are unaware, and causing him to act like a fool.  This happened to me and I experienced a 180 shift.  Life is so much better without the hangovers, wasted time and money, and destruction of your health.",

This fallacy is related to loss aversion and status quo bias, and can result in improper long-term strategic planning decisions based on short-term committed costs.\"\n\nWhy would you continue to invest your time in something that you have proof is never going to be what you want or need? It's like saying, \"whelp, already lost $50 at the black jack table, might as well keep going and gamble the 401k!\" Even when you've never won. You only continue to invest in things that provide some kind of return, including emotionally.",

            "I will be a hypocrite in answering this as I was your current BF for a couple of years of my current relationship. This sounds like addiction from every angle and something that he won't be able to handle alone (he has shown this multiple times). This is in no way an excuse for his actions. The statement you made of \"why am I not enough to make you change\" was actually the exact thing my girlfriend said to me that really made it stick and put into perspective how my actions weren't just me \"unwinding after a long week\" and had a truly devastating impact on the person I loved most in this world. \n\nI think if you say that statement to him while he's sober and he doesn't remember that exact conversation every single time he considers having a beer at the bar and where that one beer ultimately ends then there is little to no hope to be honest. I caution you to spending years trying to preserve something because you are afraid of the \"wasted time\" you will end up spending more than 4 years trying to get back the feelings that were there for the 4 year period. Classic sunk cost fallacy. The time you spend trying to change somebody who shows constantly that they are unwilling to change could have been spent creating and growing with somebody who doesn't keep pushing your feelings aside.\n\nOn the flip side, you need to stick to your guns. You are being a pushover. You SAY these actions are not OK but have continued to show that there are no real consequences for him when he acts this way. Take a break, if you still want to be with him re-evaluate the situation when you have had time to step back from it.

I now live a pretty happy and drama-free life and in probably the best relationship I\u2019ve been in, in the history of my relationships.\n\nHe needs to realize HE is the problem and the only person that can get him there is himself.

Everyone who loves an addict has that thought, of \"Why am I not enough for you to change?\"\n\nBecause addiction is a disease. It has nothing to do with you.\n\nThe meetings teach that self-control comes from knowing not to take that first drink or dose, because addicts simply don't have the capacity to regulate reason after taking any kind of inhibitor. Hence, why sober reasoning like, \"I'll drink water between beers\" is rarely actualized after a single drink. It's a lot to break down and get into... but know that addiction is 100% a disease of the mind and is usually a lifelong struggle.\n\nAn alcoholic often knows they have a problem, whether they admit it inwardly or not. Unfortunately, you can't help him if he's not ready to help himself. AA programs are recommended, as solo-sobering scarcely lasts.\n\nAnd you need to make a very hard, very painful choice:\n\nStay, and know that the abuse will continue, probably for a long time, no matter how much you support him. Disappointment and frustration will be familiar feelings. Patience will have to be mastered, and you'll have to learn to separate yourself from his disease when he has episodes. You'll likely become more of a crutch than a lover, at least in the beginning. And I think most importantly, come to terms with the fact that you are not his savior if he goes through with recovery. He has to save himself. And believe he CAN save himself without another person or thing being the foundation to his recovery. Because if that foundation goes missing, it all breaks apart.\n\nOr\n\nChoose the tough-love route and cut your losses. Admit you're not willing to sacrifice that kind of time and energy into someone who may or may not get better.. I think loving an addict is commonly a lifestyle itself that requires a specific kind of person to live it.\n\nIt's not your fault. It's not your shame. You did nothing wrong. No matter what he says, you did the best you could. At this moment in time, you two are incompatible.\n\nHe. Needs. A program. Not a relationship.",

I don't know what is so \"unwinding\" about poisoning yourself until you puke, bouncing your head off the wall, passing out in the bathroom, and being a complete asshole to everyone, But an alcoholic can rationalize it into unwinding!

And it comes down to one lie, he promised he\u2019d drink responsibly and now he\u2019s saying it\u2019s his right to \u201cunwind\u201d.

You are more than good enough.\nUnfortunately your ex has a PROBLEM and refusing to seek help for it, there\u2019s nothing you can do",
            "Nope not overreacting. His behavior is not okay. That simple. It\u2019s one step from verbal to physical abuse. He could hurt himself or someone else. Clearly isn\u2019t able to drink responsibly so shouldn\u2019t do it at all.",

It won't get any better as your relationship goes on.  It's time to end things, as hard as that is.  You deserve better, and he needs to get better.

As he becomes sicker in his disease, those around him become sick to. Trying to manage, manipulate, mother the alcoholic can drive a person crazy.

Not long after this I found out that she went out to the movies with this guy while we were still married (on her birthday while I was working overseas), and within days of the separation has now moved in with this guy\n\nMy lawyer has advised me under the state law that she is not owed spousal support because all evidence suggests she has cheated, although she claims she has every right to see or sleep with other people once we are separated. The lawyer believes that no court would see it that way, and that I\u2019m fully justified in using these legal protections \n\nAm I overreacting by cutting her off financially? After all she left me and didn\u2019t even attempt reconciliation. Should I really be paying for her new life with this new guy? There\u2019s no evidence she can provide that might prove she\u2019s just friends, so I am expected to just take that on face value and keep providing for her? \n\nUPDATE: Thank you all for your feedback and support. Obviously I\u2019m following the advice of my lawyer. This post for me was about seeing how normal people react to this situation, and me double checking my gut instinct here that her take \u201cthat they\u2019re just friends\u201d would never pass the smell test for the average Redditor. And that\u2019s clearly the case. Because she keeps telling me it\u2019s just my na\u00efvet\u00e9 and lack of experience, when in reality she\u2019s just a cheater.

That is unacceptable and disgusting.

And naturally i was severely bullied due to it.\n\nI managed to not cry in class and act normal but the entire thing gave me flashbacks of my past of being bullied and being neglected by my parents.\n\nI want to cry just thinking about what happened, i feel disgusting.\n\nIs this ok to cry about?

            "Pretty outrageous. Many if not most people don\u2019t wash their hair every day. I think it\u2019s recommended for the health of your hair not to wash it every day. Fuck them, not overreacting.",
            "Pretty much every hair dresser worth their salt will tell you not to wash your hair every day. Also, all hair is different and requires different treatment. \n\nYour teacher was way out of line.",
            "Your teacher and fellow classmates shouldn\u2019t have put you on the spot like that. And I am sorry about your past - but just for reference do you use conditioner? Because my hair is quite dry and frizzy as well and just using shampoo tends to make it worse. What you need is a nourishing conditioner and some hair oil if possible as that always helps with frizziness and makes your hair look more hydrated. If you need any recommendations please let me know. But you are not overreacting.",
            "On behalf of the many, many, many of us who only wash our hair once a week: Your teacher is an ignorant asshole who doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. There's absolutely nothing inherently unhygienic about not washing your hair every day, that's 100% pure white people nonsense. Not all hair types are meant to be washed every day. Just because they have a hair type that looks/smells gross if they don't wash it every day doesn't mean everyone does. And if washing your hair daily makes it constantly dry/frizzy, you not only don't need to be washing your hair every day, you *should not be washing your hair every day!* It's very telling that no one took issue with the state of your hair until *you* volunteered that your hair washing routine is different from theirs. \n\nYou're not overreacting, I'm so mad for you, and I'm sorry your teacher and your classmates suck.\n\n(Also, I know this isn't what you came for, but it's not the shampoo, what you're looking for is a good leave-in conditioner! Run a dab through your wet hair every day when you get out of the shower. Trust me, it's a game-changer.)",

Don\u2019t let those idiots bother you.",
            "If you came from a home where no one taught you proper hygiene, it makes a lot of sense why you'd be a bit insecure about it. There's logic in why you felt that way, so there's nothing wrong in your head\n\n\nDid you overreact? Even though you were bothered it sounds like you kept your composure. Emotions are a knee-jerk reaction, there's not much you can do about the initial impulse. You handled your emotions and the day went on.\n\n\n\nIt's fine to take a knee and cry sometimes, especially if you've got a past.\u00a0\n\n\nFor the record, your teacher is a piece of shit. There was a better way they could have addressed it without singling you out.\n\n\nMoving forward if you're still feeling sore and insecure about it, make an appointment with a hairdresser and just ask for an honest opinion. 1) is your hair looking fine, 2) how often/what product should you use to wash your specific hair. That way you can just put the issue to bed and not think about it anymore",
            "I have a gorgeous friend who literally washes her dry hair with conditioner not soap, daily shampoo is not good for dry hair .

The natural oils in your hair/scalp aren't inherently bad for you can go anywhere from 2-6 days without product and just thorough scrubbing and water. The longer your hair typically the longer you go without product from my experience.\n\n Hydrating your hair is also really important, so even on those wash days where it's particularly dry, use a leave-in conditioner of some sort to give it some extra moisture. \n\nIve an idea of the ethnic background of the people in your class and if my assumption is correct, I'm not surprised they don't know that they're wrong. I would definitely not take hair advice from someone that doesn't have your hair type. Fuck it, don't take advice from anyone about anything you deal with if they don't also deal with it. They're talking from complete ignorance. \n\nThe only thing I will say that might not be super supportive, if you/your hair stink, make sure your properly washing all your other stuff. Hands, face, clothes, bed sheets, pillow cases blankets, etc. A lot of guys don't realize how to hygiene until we're older (right about college age) so don't feel too bad if you're behind the curve.

A lot of people grew up this way - and it's wrong.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's clear that you weren't offending anyone before you stated you didn't wash your hair every day and no one could tell the difference.\n\n\nYou weren't overreacting. Ypu're underreacting, this was targeted at you in a cruel way, though the intent may not have been bad. Someone needs to inform this teacher she did wrong here.",
            "I\u2019m not old enough to be your father but I\u2019m as pissed off as any dad could be. \n\nYour teacher is the instigator. Get where fucking job. Tell somebody what they said.",
            "I have wavycurly hair. If I washed it every day it would be a fucking disaster zone. You\u2019re not being sensitive, they were all completely out of line. \n\nTry shampooing only your scalp area, and just make sure to condition your mids and ends very well. Frizziness can often be caused by protein buildup or dryness.",
            "What the teacher did was harsh, true, but I don't think the teacher gives a shit. Now to washing hair, you don't need to shampoo every day. That would actually be harmful. I shampoo once or twice a week. I also don't like to use conditioner since it makes my hair fuzzy and unruly. Shampooing once/twice a week is enough.",
            "Many people with curly hair \u2018co-wash\u2019 aka only use conditioner. It\u2019s very normal and I bet no one is calling out the influencers who do it for being dirty. \n\nNot only is this completely inappropriate, it\u2019s also incorrect. Absolutely report them.",

            "They\u2019d die if they knew that mine gets washed every 11 days when I have extension in.. don\u2019t listen to them. Washing your hair every day isn\u2019t healthy.",
            "No you are right to be upset. First your teacher and classmates are incorrect most people shouldn't shampoo their hair everyday. Second the way it was handled in any case was entirely improper.\n\n\nI think the worst case scenario here is that you were being singled out and intentionally bullied. If you think that is the case you should absolutely report it because nobody deserves to be treated that way.\n\n\nBut I also want to throw out, very gently, another possibility.\n\n\nEven though it was very poorly handled, do you think these discussions about hygiene and your teacher's lecture are happening for a reason? Like maybe they are trying to tell you something but don't know how to be direct about it?",
            "You need to have a good look at your hair. If it's oily, you know it bc it lays very flat. If your hair is dry or curly, that may be why you say you're frizzing.  Get a shampoo that says moisturizing, if you're on a tight budget and use it as you need, probably twice a week, along with conditioner. Don't use a handful of shampoo, just enough to soap your hair. If your scalp is itchy, try a dandruff shampoo.  I'm older, and my hair has lots of gray. All my life it was oily and I shampooed every day.  Now it's twice a week unless I get sweaty.  Don't get crazy buying expensive stuff until you see what works. Look into travel sizes when you're shopping, every store usually has different ones. There are also creams you can add after your hair is dried if you want more moisture and shine.",
            "I wash my hair once a week, shampoo and conditioner are a complete scam. Do you think they used shampoo in the Stone Age? No, because our bodies know how to sustain itself. Fuck them",
            "Its super normal to not wash your hair everyday, it's beter for it not  constantly stripping the natural oils.  That teacher needs to not be a teacher and get off her high horse, seems like the kids just jumped on the bandwagon. Sorry you had to experience this but just know you're not a dirty person",
            "I wish you can find a reliable source for an article explaining the benefits of not washing your hair everyday. That would be something for her to read and learn something. She should also ask her hairdresser. It\u2019s not like you are saying you don\u2019t wash your body everyday. Your hygiene is fine a long as you wash your body. Your hair does not need to be washed everyday. Rinsing it with water removes the surface dirt. That\u2019s good. You are in fact cleaning your hair. Your teacher should not be calling you out like that. You should talk to the school counselor if the classmates continue to make comments. This teacher just gave the green light to your classmates to tease and potentially bully you.",
            "It\u2019s ok to cry about whatever makes you cry. Feelings are ok. And they were mean to you and wrong. It\u2019s not healthy for your hair to wash it every day. There are plenty of sources you can find on this.",

This is a very sensitive topic for you and your teacher went about this whole thing horribly. \n\nMaybe see if there is a subreddit about haircare. If you post in there, you might be able to get some good recommendations on shampoo for your hair type. \n\nWashing your hair every day is not good for it. I do mine twice a week, but it's short so easy to manage.",

            "Your teacher is revealing her lack of knowledge in cultural differences.  What s/he said is very egocentric and an ignorance of cultural diversity.  \n\nBlack women, for instance, wash their hair roughly once every 7 to 10 days, and there are healthy reasons for that.  \n\nBut your teacher isn't mindful of this fact and is thereby openly practicing and promoting discrimination.  This is a legitimate point to bring up should you choose to report this teacher.  Classrooms must be inclusive.  A major component of a teacher's job is to embrace diversity.  By setting an arbitrary \"standard\" for all to respect, and publicly ridiculing, the teacher is offending those who don't subscribe to that standard. \n\nThere was no reason at all for the teacher to discuss what they overheard in this manner, except for the intentional purpose to judge and offend.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more this warrants reporting.",
            "That teacher seems ignorant. Not everyone needs to wash their hair everyday, especially if you have curly or coily hair.",
            "Ummm... what's wrong with that teacher; they are a bully. Bullies should not be allowed to be teachers. As far as shampooing daily, you can see in the replies, many people do not wash their hair daily. I know a few women who go 2 weeks without washing their hair... This is why they make dry shampoo. You can keep your scalp smelling fresh and absorb any oils if needed.",
            "You are NOT disgusting! Actually that teacher is a disgusting human being. I am a teacher and I would NEVER say that or anything else that would embarrass or make a student feel ashamed of themselves.

            "I wash my hair twice a week as recommended by my stylist, because I have curly hair and it\u2019s what\u2019s best for it. (I also keep it dry in between washes but that\u2019s for style reasons, not hygiene.)\n\nYour teacher is ignorant and probably has no fashion sense.",
            "Most people don't wash their hair every day.  It's not good for your hair to shampoo it daily.  \n\nI'm going to go out on a limb and say this doesn't sound like a real story.  If it is, your teacher is a lunatic, or perhaps a glitching robot, because the dialog you attributed to them doesn't sound like something a human being would say.  Maybe a poorly written \"mean teacher\" character in a children's movie, but not a real human being.",
            "i straight up wash my hair twice a week. it's a common thing for people these days. your teacher can politely go fuck themselves and i would definitely report them.",
            "The teacher is the disgusting one, singling out a student in order to cause shame.",

I assure you we\u2019re as clean as people can be. I know of many celebrities that don\u2019t wash their hair every day and some women that are like 1-2 times a week. You\u2019re not alone OP. You gotta consider the source sometimes before you let stuff bother you.",

My husband and I only shower twice a week, and no one can tell. Your classmates can't tell you rinse your hair with water either. They're all being assholes.",
            "Unless you stink, there's no problem here. It's actually recommended that you don't shampoo your hair daily as it'll dry it out and cause frizz. It's none of the professor's business and to waste class time on it was ridiculous.",
            "You're not overreacting at all. Your professor was way out of line. As someone who's also struggled with proper hygiene since childhood, the last thing I need is to be shamed for it, especially by a trusted authority figure or my peers. You're doing good, please don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\n\nAs for your hair, I'd recommend looking up the best washing routines for your natural hair type, if you haven't already. (One thing I know for sure is that daily washing does not benefit all hair types.) It's also possible that you have a certain hair condition that needs special treatment.",
            "Umm... Wtf. It's extremely unhealthy for you to wash your hair everyday. Also washing your hair with water everyday can be drying depending on what's in your water source. For instance my apartment doesn't have a water softener and the hard water is terrible for my hair. \n\nIt takes a lot of work to find what works for you. As weird as it sounds the thing I found that is most cost effective is the Costco shampoo and conditioner. I then use a hair mask every 2 weeks. I also put in leave in conditioner or an oil and it takes down the dry frizzy hair.\n\nAs for your professor... A few things you can do. Report them to their superior. Many colleges also have a student union where you can get support for matters like this. It was completely inappropriate for her to make this comment. Also the rate my professor website is a great way to make comments anonymously.",

If you need to take a cry, take one. I'm 20 years old and find myself locking the bathroom door and sobbing somedays (is this normal? Maybe not, but it usually happens 1-2 times a month.

            "It's not OK for your teacher to say that it's disgusting.  Proper hygiene depends a lot on the individual.  My daughter is black and to properly care for her hair and scalp after shampooing is a lot of work and not practical or healthy for her to do every day.  Moisturizing, brushing, braiding, daily sure, unless it was in cornrows and then they'd stay in for 3-4 weeks.  With proper care that's perfectly fine and best for her skin and hair.  My son who is white on the other hand get's really greasy hair after just skipping a few days so we do have to remind him on occasion.",

A big heaping glob and a bit of fingertip scrubbing leaves it feeling clean without crunch and passes the sniff test Everytime. \n\nCheap V05 conditioners are very popular for this. I used this method when I used to color my hair. It even works on fine thin hair and straight hair.",

When I was younger I washed it every other day as it was more oily and I was more active.\n\nBlack people and people with texture hair do not wash their hair daily.\n\nMost people don't wash their hair daily.\n\nYour teacher and classmates are ignorant of the varieties of hair care standards around the world and shaming others is not appropriate.",

            "Yes it\u2019s okay, and you\u2019re not overreacting. I washed my hair daily for years because I thought it was hygienic. I\u2019m married and have two teenage boys. I\u2019ve had a dandruff problem as far back as I can remember. My wife asked me about it recently and she was shocked to learn that I shampoo and condition every day. \n\nHer first recommendation was to shampoo every other day, and condition daily if needed (?). Through a system of trial and error, I\u2019ve actually found a \u201cco-wash\u201d that works for me (a conditioning wash, but distinctly different from combined shampoo conditioners like Pert Plus). I haven\u2019t had dandruff since (and I cycled through all the dandruff shampoos too). The co-wash brand is called \u201cAs I Am\u201d and it comes in a blue tub (ie not the red one) at Sally Beauty Supply. *I never would have found it if it wasn\u2019t for my wife* because it isn\u2019t sold anywhere else. If it wasn\u2019t for my wife, I also would have just continued existing as a disgusting mess of dandruff too. \n\nAnyway, unless I get sweaty, particularly oily, or I use pomade, I use it in a range from every other day to once a week. \n\nThe point I\u2019m trying to make is that you were not wrong, and your teacher is most definitely wrong.",
            "Uh\u2026.washing your hair every day isn\u2019t necessary for pretty much anyone, and the curlier your hair is, the worse it is for it. \u00a0Your average person with straight hair only needs to wash it 2-3 times a week, and super curly hair, you can go much longer. \u00a0Your teacher a) knows nothing about hair, and b) is just mean. \u00a0Being mean AND wrong is the worst combination. \u00a0",

If they really felt it needed attention, they should have said something to you privately, BUT this didn't need special attention. You shower in a way that works for you. I know people who shower daily, every few days, up to maybe weekly. And also for hair washing especially. Diffent hair does better with different times between washes. For me, it's 3-6 days between washes. That was inconsiderate and hurtful of your teacher to bring this up in this way.",

It's better to only wash it 1x to 2x a week. \n\nOn a sidenote try to find a good all natural Shampoo & Conditioner for dry hair & you can also do essential oil treatments on your scalp & hair to help with the brittle dry problem.  I have 6 boys, 1 has waist length hair as do I, we shower daily but no one washes their hair more than 2x a week, usually only once bc we have hard water here & our hair dries out & mine literally falls out if I wash it daily. \n\nYour teacher is an @$$!!",
            "I'm so sorry you experienced this in front of the class. This is completely unacceptable. Washing you hair everyday is unnatural and actually unhealthy for you. Shampoos have so many toxic chemicals that strip the hair follicles of their natural oils and it damages your natural hair texture in the long run. And it's on purpose for these companies to make you buy their other products to undo the damage they caused. It's all a scheme.\n\nYou are not being sensitive. You were just disrespected and you are not disgusting. You are valid and don't allow the opinions of ignorant people let you think otherwise. I also have a hard time finding a shampoo that suits my hair well so it's not just you!",

            "That's ridiculous, and I am the same way as you! I RARELY wash my hair with shampoo. I really only do if I know it's dirty, as in something got in it. It's almost always just a rigorous scrub with water. It leaves my hair feeling much healthier and less 'dead'. I've never had anyone tell me it looks dirty, feels dirty, or smells dirty.

Tell him that his looking directly at you AND the discussion he overheard and alluded to both say otherwise.) Tell him you'd rather not report him, but he needlessly and callously caused you discomfort and humiliation, so if you don't get the apology and in class, you'll have no choice.\n\nIf you're too shy to do this in person, say it in a letter or email and attach the articles. \n\nWhy is this better than reporting him right off the bat? Reporting him may or may not earn him a scolding, but it probably wouldn't mean he'd have to apologize to you in class, which would then set the other students straight. \n\nYou were in the right here, and his behavior was unwarranted and unprofessional.",

She says that most of the clients who come through the salon would not have the issues like breakage, dry hair, thinning, fragile roots etc if they washed less, as you\u2019re actually stripping your hair of important natural oils and it can weaken your roots. The last 2 times I went students washed my hair for me and both also had nothing but nice things to say about my hair and also specifically said I was \u201csmart\u201d to not wash my hair too much. \n\nSo f**k them, not only are they actually wrong they also clearly have no idea what empathy is or discretion. \n\nIf you need to talk my messages are always open and I have a million other tips/advice if you ever get curious!",

I struggle with the same thing and wash my hair twice a week usually.\n\nif I'm really depressed, my hygiene lacks (showering less often, avoiding brushing teeth) which just brings PTSD and anxiety etc etc etc \n\nanyways I just wanted you to know you're not alone, your reaction to this is more than valid, and please talk to someone (if you can) about this because that teacher crossed a huge line. big hugs\ud83d\udc9a",

Maybe she was taught it was appropriate to wash your hair every day or had her own struggles with hygiene, and she thought she was helping you out? Teachers aren\u2019t perfect, but I think most enter their profession because they want to help people. If she has been decent in the past and this is a first offense, maybe let her know this really hurt your feelings. If you feel comfortable doing so, tell her your story of being bullied and how her comment made you feel. I think most people would apologize knowing they caused someone so much pain.

If that teacher tried telling me to wash my hair every day, I'd tell him to go pound sand and where to shove it and to go consult a stylist about hair care.

            "You\u2019re in the right - you actually shouldn\u2019t be shampooing your hair every day, especially without conditioner.\n\nI have sensitive, breakout-prone, dry skin on my body, so I wash my body every day (sometimes twice a day) followed by whatever lotions or sprays I feel I might need - likewise, I have oily skin on my face, so I wash my face every day (again, sometimes twice a day) followed by moisturizer if I feel I need it that day.\n\nHowever, I only shampoo every three or four days immediately followed by a conditioner. There was a time where I\u2019d shampoo every day (sometimes twice a day) and my hair was very dry and I didn\u2019t know what was wrong. It was because I was shampooing so often, especially without conditioner. I slowly transitioned to shampooing every other day then every three or four days with conditioner daily, but then my hair became too oily and unmanageable that way. It\u2019s because you\u2019re not supposed to wash your hair every day, and you\u2019re not supposed to condition your hair every day. Ever since I\u2019ve changed to every three or four days for my hair, it\u2019s been much more manageable and it\u2019s felt healthier. Hell, even after I\u2019ve used hairspray or curling product I still might wait a day before I shampoo (I\u2019ll thoroughly rinse, though).\n\nTLDR unless you\u2019re swimming in rivers or playing in dirt or using product in your hair every day, you don\u2019t need to and shouldn\u2019t be shampooing your hair every single day.",

I\u2019m sorry they brought up those feelings. \n\nWhat you are doing is not gross or wrong.",
            "You\u2019re not overreacting, and please file a complaint with the department/school. What that teacher did was highly inappropriate. Firstly, if there WERE hygiene concerns (and that would only be if there were noticeable odor, not because they happen to disagree with your routine), the appropriate approach would have been to speak with you privately and in a caring, non-shaming or accusatory manner. Secondly, the attitude they expressed has some racial implications and probably made more other people uncomfortable too who didn\u2019t feel they could argue in that environment. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. Your teacher was a jerk and hopefully the school will address it.",
            "Your teacher deserves a dope slap for the way she handled this situation. College professors are not in a position to talk about personal values re: hygiene standards. And there are different textures of hair that require different care routines.  I don't know of any curly haired people who wash everyday.  Your teacher basically set up a situation where bullying would take place. A lot of programs pride themselves in diversity, but don't know how to actually handle it when someone comes from a different background than the rest of the herd. So yeah, you are right to feel that you were bullied. If the topic of hair care comes up again, be ready to assert that 'Maybe you don't have much knowledge outside of your social circle,  but I'm here to tell you that it is the new norm to wash less frequently'. And if your hair is curly or kinky, call that out, give them a little dope slap and educate them. \n\nThoughts about shampoo and too frequent hairwashing:  It's likely that your classmates are using posh products that don't strip the oil from their hair as much as a cheap shampoo will do. There is a whole \"no poo\" movement where people stop using shampoo. I have a friend who only used water and I have to say, he developed bad head odor pretty fast. If you can't afford the expensive products like New Wash (which I love!) maybe you can find something that isn't as harsh on your hair.  You can talk to other people or hair stylists who have your hair texture for tips on keeping it in good condition or just go online and start doing some research.",
