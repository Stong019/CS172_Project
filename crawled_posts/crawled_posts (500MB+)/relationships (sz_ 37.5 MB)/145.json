        "selftext": " \n**tl;dr**: I am a match for my half-sister and she wants me to consider donating. I have not told her I am a match and do not want to donate to her. \n\n-----\n\n**Edited this for clarity. My phone sort of sucks.**\n\nThe TLDR is pretty much the gist of it. \n\nI (29f) am not close with my half sister Kara (33f). She has always been very clear about not wanting to be close. She never takes up offers to stay with me and the only times I have seen my 'nieces' have been when I ask. I drive up, I take them out to dinner, and she calls the night short because they have an early bedtime. \n\nShe has told me that she doesn't want them calling me auntie because it would be validating my father's cheating. Which is true, I am the cheating baby. Still, I wanted to have a relationship with my nieces *4 and 6* but have now pretty much given up. \n\nI talk to them on the phone bimonthly. I sent presents and write them letters. \n\nI am much closer to my brother's kids and am an auntie to several friends' offspring. \n\nKara (33f) called me up last month and asked to get coffee. We are about two hours apart, so it's a bit of a drive to see her. I agreed, she sounded rough. While Kara is my half-sister, she has no relation with my brother (who was adopted). There isn't a lot of other family members around to ask. Most are either too old, too young, or not a match. My aunt (67) could not donate even if she was a match. Most of Kara's friends have tried and they are not matches. \n\nShe asked me to get tested. I agreed, thinking I wouldn't be a match. Turns out I am. My husband and I decided that I wouldn't donate because we want to have kids in the future and I don't want to risk my health. The doctor agreed to tell Kara I am not a match. \n\nI have seen what happens to people who donate. I have a friend who donated and her life is fucked. She has a lot of health problems, couldn't do the things she did before, and she is only 27. At 29, I don't want to suffer the same fate for the rest of my life.  \n\nI just wonder if I should be honest with her at all? Will it do any good to tell her I am a match but I have reasons to not do it (wanting to have a child, not wanting to be ill?) Would it just make it worse? \n\nShe has already been told that I am not a match and put on a waiting list. Part of me thinks I am being selfish for wanting to tell her. Another part of me feels I shouldn't be lying to her about who I am. We have never been close, so I feel it's wrong to pretend I am on her side when really I am deciding to put my own health and life first. \n\nDo I tell her? Or do I not? I jut wondered how to handle this. ",

            "You're not obligated to tell her just like you're not obligated to donate.\n\nWhat do you expect will happen when you tell her? Sure, you might feel better about yourself but is it worth the fall out?",
            "I donated a kidney six years ago and have had no complications at all, but different outcomes do happen. \n\nRegardless, not wanting to donate is a perfectly valid reason not to. \n\nWhen you go through pre-donation screening, part of the process is a psychological screen to make sure you are willing, mentally healthy, and doing everything of your own free will. During my screening the doctors explicitly offered to lie and make up a reason for why I couldn't donate if I decided at any point I didn't want to go forward.  That offer is intended to ensure that families don't guilt people into donating who really aren't interested. \n\nI think your lie is perfectly justified to keep the peace. If she wanted you to help her down the line she shouldn't have been cruel to you over things you can't control. I donated to my dad because he's a good guy and I love him. I don't think I'd go through donation for a stranger, and I definitely wouldn't for someone who I didn't like much. ",
            "Do nothing further. There's a reason your doctor offered to lie: because you, and every other prospective donor, have every right, morally and legally, to not have a part of your body removed for someone else's potential benefit. You do not deserve to be criticized or have your life made otherwise difficult for choosing not to donate. \n\nDoctors are obligated to follow some pretty arcane ethical rules. If an ethical doctor agrees to obscure your test results, there's a good reason for it. ",
            "They offer to lie for a reason- because no one should be pressured into this kind of decision, and if you tell her, you absolutely will be. Let it stand.",
            "Regardless of your decision, as someone who has studied and worked in a clinical setting regarding kidney transplantation I have to call out that you have been largely misinformed of the risks.\n\nFirst of donors that are match are thoroughly evaluated before they can donate to rule them out if they have any conditions that would put them at risk; to ensure they will survive the surgery with no major complications; and to ensure the candidate is not a risk for developing kidney disease themselves. Although this evaluation cannot predict the future as in many other aspects of life, it is considered best clinical practice and proven to be very successful.\n\nSecondly I would like to point out that because the evaluations are so thorough and exclude anyone who is not an acceptable candidate, kidney donors actually  tend to do BETTER than OR just AS WELL as the general population with regards to their long term health. \n\nSo your friend who donated  that you mentioned was 'fucked', although you did not mention in detail what happened, for argument's sake lets say her health was impacted in some way in which if she had not donated she would have done better, she is a very RARE case.\n\nSeveral studies have time and time again proven the aforementioned facts. You are entitled to make your decision with regards to whether you donate or not. BUT PLEASE -at the very least- in honor of your sister and all those on the waiting list for a kidney or other organ, do not pass around misinformation regarding donation. Rates are already low enough due to people's ignorance on the topic, we don't need to further fuel fear and misunderstanding.\n\n",
            "So you aren't her kids Auntie but you ARE her sister? Sounds like you are family when it suits her. Keep your organs.",
            "She's already been told you're not a match. Leave it at that. If you tell her otherwise, nothing good will come of it. She'll know you lied. And she may even try to convince you to change your mind.\n\nYou decided not to donate. You don't need to tell her the reasons.",
            "People are going to be trying to change your mind on donating a kidney. You have already said you don't want to donate. \n\nSo I will answer you question. Don't tell her. It is worse to give her hope. She might get a donation from another party and then you will have sunk the relationship for no reason. ",
            "Don't tell her. It's already obvious that you two are not on the same side. She still thinks that your existence validates your fathers' cheating, and I suspect that she views you mostly as an organ farm. Distance yourself and go on with your life. ",
            "There's a reason the doctor agreed to lie for you. People have been pressured and shamed into donating by family and friends. \n\nYour \"sister\" has been pretty clear. She does not like you as a person and resents you for being born. You're not good enough to be \"auntie\" or \"family\", but you're good enough to hit up for organs when she needs them. You don't owe her a kidney or the truth. ",
            "So you're not good enough to be an aunt but your organs are and they're up for grabs? Yeah, *fuck that.* Keep it to yourself and move on with your life. You're under zero obligation to destroy your life for her. ",
            "Honestly they won't allow you to donate unless you are 100%  willing to do so.\n\nIf you aren't, they won't clear you as a matched donor. That's why they give you the results in private.",
            "Read My Sister's Keeper. The ending isn't wonderful but there is a lot of good discussion about the ethics of transplants, consent and personal advocacy. This is usually used for other medical issues but it still holds true here- your body, your choice.",
            "If you needed a kidney,  do you really think she'd hesitate to say \"no\" or \"not a match\". \n\nShe's made it very clear that she doesn't want to be a part of your life, so you don't need to tell her anything or feel bad about saying that you're not a match. She would definitely not give you a kidney if you needed one. ",
            "I'm just curious - she drove to your town for the coffee, right - when she asked for your kidney? Like, she didn't ask you to make the 4 hour round trip to her town to then ask you for a kidney?",
            "I donated half of my liver to my father, who I undoubtedly loved very much. At first, I wanted to donate as soon as possible (mostly because it seemed \"time was running out\"), but the doctors made us wait almost a year to decide, because it is a tough, life-changing decision.  Regardless of having a close relationship, it was still hard to decide, I went back and forth about donating throughout that time but eventually decided to donate. \nPersonally, I don't think your relationship with your half sister is, strong enough to warrant going through the physical and more so mental distress of donating.\nMy dad ended up dying a couple weeks after surgery, and im alright with my decision cause I loved him, but it sounds like you wouldn't want to be in that position.\nTldr don't do it and don't feel guilty about not wanting to do it.  Xox\n",
            "If you are sure about your decision, take it with you to the grave. There are absolutely no benefits to telling her the truth, and a mountain of risks. ",
            "Ok.  It's your kidney.  You don't have to donate it.  Unless you want to torpedo your relationship with her and half your family, keep your mouth shut.  ",
            "Nope. She's already been told you aren't a match so problem solved. I find it funny how you two don't have much of a relationship at all (thanks to her) and she has the nerve to ask you for something as serious as this. Don't even feel bad for lying about it.",
            ">She has told me that she doesn't want them calling me auntie because it would be validating my father's cheating. \n\nWhat the fucking shit. Why are you even still talking to this horrible person? Definitely don't give her a kidney. She sounds so awful.\n",
            "it is absolutely legit not to want to donate a kidney. it's called donation because you would do it because you want to do it. since you dont want to, you don't have to.\n\ni would not tell her that you are a match, since this might cause her to try all kinds of things to get that kidney. she may treat you like a god, lick your feet and what else not, she may even try to guilt trip you just to change your mind and donate. so you are clearly better off when she thinks you are not a match. if she for some reason gets to know you are a genetically match then you still could make up some health problems of yourself that make it unable to donate.\n\nshort answer: don't tell her no matter what.\n",
            "Either tell and donate, or don't and don't. There is no middle ground, here.\n\nUnless you enjoy being excoriated and outcast, of course.",
            "> She has told me that she doesn't want them calling me auntie because it would be validating my father's cheating. Which is true, I am the cheating baby.\n\nFirst of all, what the fuck is this? You're still their aunt. You try to have a relationship with her kids. It wasn't your fault that your father cheated and out you came. So this is total bullshit that you can't be called your **rightful** family relation to those kids because she has some dumb mindset about what your father did. Ridiculous.\n\n> She asked me to get tested. I agreed, thinking I wouldn't be a match. Turns out I am. My husband and I decided that I wouldn't donate because we want to have kids in the future and I don't want to risk my health.\n\nGood, don't give it to her. Focus on what you want. You have plans for your life and your half sister if she can't get over you being \"the cheating product\" then she doesn't deserve your body part since that is what she deemed you as.",
            "Don't tell her or anyone, it saves on shit. A kidney, as you say, is a big deal and not owed to anyone who has treated you coldly at best. You don't need to explain this to everyone once ever 5 minutes for the rest of your life.",
            "My brother donated a kidney to my father when he was 24. He is in amazingly great health! The only reason that I say this is because you seem to have stigmatized organ donation and it's truly a life saving procedure that grants life to those whose bodies can't support themselves anymore. I don't want your anecdotal experiences with the procedure to deter anyone else on here who may be considering donating an organ. \n\nHaving said that, part of the process of donating an organ involves rigorous psychological screening of both parties. Giving up a part of your body is a lot to deal with mentally, and doctors are very cautious to make sure that someone is in their right mind, truly committed to the procedure and the changes that it's going to have on their lives and possibly their relationships. Based on what you've posted, you'd be screened out by this portion of the procedure. You may be a biological match but you are not psychologically capable of doing it (and FYI that's not a bad thing). So, don't feel guilty. And I think you're in the right to not even let her know that you are a biological match, it helps keep things from becoming over-complicated. ",
            "> The doctor agreed to tell Kara I am not a match. \n\nStick with that. This is one of those times where it's ok to lie. The risk of donating an organ is much higher for you than it is for her to receive one.\n\nThen add in, that you would need time off work and activities to recover and you would still have medical bills to pay in relation to the operation and post-operative care.\n\nPersonally, I think it's pretty selfish of her to even ask you to get tested after how she's treated you. The fact you agreed to testing in the first place shows you have more class than she does.",
            "Like I once told my mother in law and my brother in law, actions and words have consequences, often unforeseen ones.\n\nIf you want someone to donate a kidney to you, you better spend a lifetime loving and giving to make them feel that you're worthy of that sacrifice.\n",
            "> I have seen what happens to people who donate. I have a friend who donated and her life is fucked. She has a lot of health problems, couldn't do the things she did before, and she is only 27. At 29, I don't want to suffer the same fate for the rest of my life.\n\nWhatever you decide is fine, but living with a single kidney is not going to \"fuck\" your life.\n\nI'm 37 and doing just fine with one.  \n\nI do everything anyone else does and I've never suffered for losing the one that was removed.  I have no hard limitations, no pains, no special regimes to follow... except for a bad ass scar you'd never know.\n\nI'm friends with a girl who had to have both of hers removed after acute renal failure and she received a donation of a kidney from her then 55 year old mother.  This girl went on to get pregnant, have a perfectly healthy baby, and is herself still perfectly healthy now many years out from the transplant.\n\nPlease don't scare people from living donation because you don't want it.",
            "Just leave it as-is.\n\nShe doesn't get to spend her life actively pushing you away and then expecting you to donate a kidney because no one else in her life matches.  (Seriously, she came to you after she asked her friends.)  That is a huge commitment from you, and she seems to just consider you a last resort.",
            "Just because you are a match does not mean you are a good candidate to donate, they are two different things entirely. There are costs and health risks associated with being a living kidney donor that you are just not prepared to take on.   \n\nYou have spoken with your doctor and your husband and have made an informed choice in consideration of your own health and your plans to have children in mind. You can choose to tell your half sister this or not, either way will be difficult. I think the truth is best personally and as much guilt as a person can try to heap upon me to reconsider that I have taken things into consideration with the big picture in mind which also includes my own mortality.\n\nI wish you the very best of luck, it is not a spot anybody wishes to be in and I know I appreciate anyone who is in a position to be a living donor or anyone who considers organ donation upon expiration, it can save up to 8 people's lives according to UNOS so for any who can it is great to consider organ donation.",
            "I feel like this is one of those situations where I would ask myself \"would she do the same for me?\"\n\nNow I know that that shouldn't be the only question you ask yourself nor should it be the one that solely determines your decision. Which it's obvious you have thought this through and are wise about your own health. But i'm also going to ask out of curiosity; \n\nIf you two were really close would you have done it?",
            "She has asked you for something so personal, burdensome, and risky. It's something I would only do for a handful of people, like immediate family and my fiance. With that said, I wouldn't tell anyone else that I can but I won't. It's not dishonesty as much as it's a decision to not break someone's heart. She's not going to think about how distant and cold she's been with you all along. In her moment of need and weakness, she's only going to think \"she can help me, but she won't.\" You don't need that kind of guilt and you don't need to put your health at risk or lower your chances of having your own family for someone who refused to treat you like family. Plus, she is on a waiting list and hopefully she will find another match. In the meantime, you can offer physical help and moral support.",
            "You have no obligation to sacrifice your health and future for a person who acts like family toward you only when it is beneficial for them.\n\n\"Sorry Kara, I'm not match for your transplant. Best of luck though.\"\n\n^^ That is all that needs to be said. End of issue.",
            "She doesn't even treat you like she loves you, but simply acts like she acknowledges your minimum existence. That's fucked up. \n\nDon't donate. ",
            "Wow. You're not being selfish for wanting a good life for you, your husband, and future kids. Neither you are selfish for keeping the secret or wanting to tell her. In this case, at all, you're not being selfish. \n\nWhat do you win telling her? And what do you win keeping the information for yourself? If you tell her that you're compatible but won't donate, it is going to make your personal future any better? \n\nMy opinion is to keep it to yourself. From my point of view you're only going to make her desesperate, and showing interest in you only within these circumstances...",

So do you lie or tell the truth about the test results? \n\nFirst of all, this person is not very nice to you, in many different ways. She rejects you as a family member and a human until she discovers she needs a kidney, then she reaches out. The only reason you want a relationship with her is because you want a relationship with your niece and nephew. \n\nIf you lie about the test results, this will allow you to continue trying to have a relationship with the kids. But your sister will continue interfering and judging you on things that are completely out of your control. How will you feel every time she says something degrading to you knowing that you could have donated a kidney? Will it eat away at you? Will your secret make it harder for you to patiently try to gain your sister's love and acceptance? Knowing  you have the ability to save her life when she treats you like dirt could make it very difficult for you to continue a relationship with her.\n\nOr would you rather be honest up front so that you can get all the bad feelings out of the way now and let time heal the wounds? If you're honest, you're giving her the chance to react as a decent adult and family member. Her true colors will show. Maybe she will cut you out of her life, maybe she will accept it and spend her last few years alive forming a close bond with her sister. Facing her own mortality may make her see things in a new light.\n\nIt's a lot to think about and ultimately it boils down to your feelings. If you are okay with keeping a secret for the rest of your life and lying about it to your niece and nephew, then tell her you're not a match. You have to realize that you will be lying about it more than just to initially deliver the news to your sister. You'll be lying to anyone who ever brings it up and it could continue for years. But if you know yourself well enough to predict that the secret will cause you pain and suffering and that you will eventually reveal the truth to your family, then maybe you should just be honest up front. If you were to tell the truth after a few years and possibly after your sister passes, people will be much angrier than they will be if you tell them  now.\n\nWhatever you decide to do, I sincerely hope you stick to your guns and don't donate the kidney. I believe your reasons for not doing so only scratch the surface and that you're making the right choice. Good luck and update us on your decision.",

            "I, personally, could not live with myself if I didn't donate the kidney to someone I knew who needed it. My awful ex-h told a judge that I'm a bad mother and tried to take my kids from me, and I'd **still** probably give him a kidney. And I'm the one who asked for the divorce! But, that's my personal thing. No one is under any personal obligation to do anything with their body that they don't want. Family or not.\n\nOP, if this is something you're not comfortable doing, absolutely do not do it. I don't think telling your half-sister does anyone any good. Please don't feel bad for doing what is right for you, your husband and your future family.\n\nI hope she is able to get a donated kidney from the registry.\n\n",
            "This woman has kids and needs a kidney...most people who donate can still have kids and don't have health problems.",
            "So... I have to ask. If she dies and leaves your nieces motherless, how will you feel knowing you could've helped prevent that? \n\nAre you going to go to the funeral? \n\nI totally get how you feel though. I have a sibling that I would not donate to. I wouldn't even lie about it. But then again my sibling doesn't have children that I would have to face one day. I'm just saying maybe consider it from another perspective?\n\n",
            "When I was in the hospital with a severe kidney infection, my little brother (who can barely stand me) called me up and told me if I needed a kidney, he'd give me one provided we were a match. He didn't really understand that my kidneys aren't diseased, they just needed iv antibiotics. It was the thought...\n\nPoor Kara. Her own sister doesn't care if she lives or dies. I don't suggest you tell her unless you just want to be a cruel ... Person... who enjoys crushing spirits.\n\nKarma is a thing.",
            "So it's okay with you if she dies and you could have saved her?",
            "\"Look, xxx, I love you, but things aren't going to work out.\" If she presses you, \"That's all I want to say about it.\" :)",
            "Don't tell her. You *really* **really** shouldn't have bothered getting tested if you weren't willing to actually do it. That's extremely cruel to her, and those who love her (her children). You shouldn't tell her you were a match. But I would also warn you that it might be best if you let the idea of a relationship with her go. I can't imagine it ever being productive after this to get to have any sort of relationship with her children, especially if she dies from whatever illness is so severe she needs a new kidney. ",

        "selftext": "My partner (25m) is my (26f) rock and I\u2019m his. Literally he tells me that all the time including yesterday. We\u2019ve been together for five years and have a truly wonderful relationship. Always talking, laughing, comfortable with one another. Able to communicate even when we disagree. After I survived abuse as a child and struggled with unhealthy romantic relationships in the past, the fact that we love each other in a respectful, secure and profoundly healthy way is truly my biggest blessing and I wake up every day so happy and grateful for him. He is an incredible man with so much drive, intelligence, kindness, and gifts to give the world.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago it came up for the first time that we saw ourselves getting married one day. It was such a beautiful moment and it rocked my world to have been vulnerable, said those words, and have him say them too. Since then it\u2019s been something incredibly happy that I get to hold in my heart and look forward to. The subject has come up sporadically since then but I haven\u2019t wanted to push it too far since we are young and it is very much an \u201ceventually\u201d thing. Both of our parents are divorced and his come from money. He got a lot of strong advice growing up not to marry young and to protect his assets, to see it from a more financial view than I ever have thought of it. \n\nNevertheless the thought makes me happy and we often daydream about the future we\u2019ll build together: the little house in New Hampshire we hope to buy and the dogs and chickens we\u2019ll have. These are conversations he participates in and brings up on his own all the time. I want to be able to talk casually about the marriage aspect, too - go to bed with a sleepy \u201ccan\u2019t wait to marry you\u201d or \u201clove of my life\u201d - but for some reason recently whenever the subject has come up he\u2019s clammed up and made it feel really serious. This culminated maybe two months ago with a really weird conversation in which I sensed he might not have processed what marriage really means to him in the way that I had, and that he wasn\u2019t ready to be talking about this in the way that I was or as much as he had let on. I told him I don\u2019t want to put a gun to his head, this is just something that makes me happy to think about and talk about, and I tell him everything. I said I love him for him; I\u2019d wait as long as he needs; but that I firmly didn\u2019t want to bring up the subject again until he was comfortable discussing it. I wanted to relieve the pressure on him, and I haven\u2019t mentioned it since. \n\nWell, yesterday we spent a really lovely day getting lunch and hiking with my family. They live far away so we don\u2019t see them very often. My stepsister and her fianc\u00e9 were there as well, and of course there was a little bit of light conversation about their upcoming wedding. My bf was his usual friendly, easygoing self. I noticed he seemed quiet on the way home and later that evening so I asked if he was worried about work but he just said he was tired from a long day traveling. I made him a drink, kissed him on the forehead like I always do and promised we could do whatever he wanted to relax that night. Just did what I normally do when I can tell he\u2019s stressed, try to show empathy and take care of him. \n\nBut then as I\u2019m making dinner he comes over to me and drops this bomb. He came over to me crying and said spending time with an engaged couple and even barely talking about their wedding had sent him into a panic and he didn\u2019t know if he could ever see himself getting married. I was completely blindsided. I tried to parse what he was saying but it was like my brain was stuck. Evidently he had been locking himself in his office at work all week crying about this. I kept asking him why he would say he wanted to marry me if he didn\u2019t. He said he was lying, basically. That he wanted to give me what he knew I wanted to make me happy. I could only just stare at him open mouthed. I kept trying to pinpoint if he was saying to me, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be ready to get married for a long time\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be ready to get married\u201d and I really don\u2019t think he knows himself. I don\u2019t think he has processed marriage at all and this is the first time it\u2019s hitting him. He kept saying stuff about not knowing where his career will lead or if he\u2019ll have money (he has a great job, an outstanding network, and is definitely not poor. Neither of us are) and I was just like. We\u2019re a partnership. You wanted to be with me yesterday, you want to be with me today, do you want to be with me tomorrow? Yes, he said. I said well that\u2019s all what matters, we have a life we love and we\u2019ll take on the future together one day. \n\nI\u2019m devastated. He left for his stepmother\u2019s house and I don\u2019t know when he\u2019ll be home. I can not take another sleeping pill or my heart will stop but I can\u2019t sleep a wink. I literally spiked a 100 degree fever and spent all night sweating and freezing. I had no idea it was possible to be in so much pain it makes you physically sick. This person is the bedrock of my life. We have ALWAYS had rock solid confidence that we can trust each other, be vulnerable around each other, and be our full authentic selves without inhibition or fear of judgment We share everything together and we are best friends. He even said that over and over as he sobbed and told me he loved me and that he didn\u2019t want to get married. Hours ago I had the most beautiful and solid relationship in the world. Now I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to break up. I\u2019m reeling. I feel like I\u2019ve been stabbed in the back by my safe space. The earth fell out from under me and I don\u2019t even know what to think any more. \n\nWhat do I even do or say to save this? Was I too strong in voicing my desire to get married that I scared him off? Has anyone else gone through something similar?\n\nTLDR; my boyfriend of five years held in all his fears about marriage and commitment and they all exploded out at once, and now our amazing and healthy relationship could completely sink out of nowhere.",

            "A lot of commenters are drawing really firm lines in the sand here, but I think this is really a question you have to ask yourself, OP. \n\nI agree with something someone else said: there\u2019s an outsized response with your boyfriend with regards to marriage and maybe now that he\u2019s not so terrified to tell you his feelings about getting married himself, he may be able to express his thoughts regarding marriage to you soon. \n\nIf you\u2019ve always communicated and have always been able to talk, that hasn\u2019t changed. This talk just hurts more. I think you owe it to yourself and your relationship to figure out the *why*. \n\nYou also owe it to yourself to decide if this is a dealbreaker, no matter what his reasoning. \n\nThere are two questions here:\nWhy does your boyfriend have such fear of getting married?\nIf he\u2019s unable or unwilling to get over those fears, are you okay with never marrying him?\n\nEven the best relationships with the best communication need help sometimes, OP. It may be worth considering finding a good relationship counselor and having them mediate this talk. It\u2019s going to be tough.",
            "So he doesn\u2019t want to get married, but you mentioned that he has divorced parents and a traumatized childhood. You also said that he sounded like a scared kid when he was telling you this. This behavior sounds like it\u2019s a trauma response to stress and not an actual issue with you or the relationship. \n\nHis fear of marriage is probably directly related with feelings/behaviors he developed as a \u201cself defense\u201d mode when he was a kid watching f his parents fight/divorce. (a lot of people who go to therapy find that their unwanted behaviors actually started when they were kids). \n\nIt sounds like he needs to do some counseling/therapy to deal with those deep issues. Be supportive and encouraging and see if he is willing to go see a councilor.",
            "This sounds like a trauma response from his parent\u2019s divorce.",
            ">We have ALWAYS had rock solid confidence that we can trust each other, be vulnerable around each other, and be our full authentic selves without inhibition or fear of judgment\n\nI mean, you still do? There is not much more open, emotionally honest and vulnerable than what your BF just showed and shared with you.    \n\nThe question I ask myself reading this story - why does your BF react like getting married is him agreeing to 50 cane slashes on the bare feet every two weeks? What he displays is not a rational response, outside of being threatened to re-live torture.  \n\nThere are discussions to be had around marriage, yes. It's first and foremost a legal contract, what are the obligations we subject ourselves to. What are legal defaults, what are options that are available. Which do we need, how is money handled, both are equally working etc. But this is not it. \"Threatening\" marriage should not trigger this. Whatever that is. Your BF is obviously mentally hurt and unwell.",
            "I would assume he was not directly lying to you about his intentions, but things Get very real really quick at some point. \n\nI would not throw away five years over one episode. It could be other stuff bothering him that he has not shared yet. Obviously he has not been honest about his feelings, but that doesnt mean it is something fundamentally wrong with the relationship. It sounds like he had like a panic attack, so I would take all of the things he said with a grain of salt.\n\nIt could very well be that it is over, but if it is not it is up to you to be strong now. Wether you like it or not the ball is in your court. If you are strong enough you could text him that you hope he is doing okay and that he can reach out when he is ready. \n\nIn the meanwhile you can think for yourself what you could live with. Your idea of marriage is maybe not the same as his, prenup and separate finances for instance. Your idea of a timeline is for sure not the same as his. But could you live with marriage down the line, or potentially no marriage at all.",
            "One of my exes said to me after maybe 6 months to a year in, drunk... \"I can't wait to marry you\". And that was it for me, the seed was sown. I too suffered from childhood abuse and I don't really think he entirely understood the gravity of him saying that to me flippantly. He came from a family of money and divorce, I did not. It was never about the money for me. After a year or two I brought up the conversation of marriage and got the \"maybe, but not yet\". Then I would get \"no, I don't believe in marriage\" 4, 5, 6, 7 years passed. Every Christmas, birthday, anniversary and NYE I would hope and pray for that ring. I got plenty of \"shut up\" rings in the course of our relationship. He never really delved into why he was so apposed to marriage. I even mentioned I was happy to sign any prenup to protect his assets.\n\nHe just never did, and it crushed me, because I saw it as a reflection on me and him not wanting to commit to me. \n\nMy new partner and I have been together for just over a year and he talks about marriage often, we've even got a playlist ready, he tells me about dreams he has and plans for our future but I am terrified he will turn around one day and say he's changed his mind. But I am not pressing or pushing for it. If it does happen I want it to come naturally.\n\nWhat you've got to ask yourself is, is this a deal breaker? If it is, then it maybe worth you thinking about what to do long term. If you spend the rest of your life just being this man's girlfriend, would you be happy?\n\nYou also need to discuss together, without blame or accusation why he feels the way he does and why he changed his mind. (to me it's outside influence scaring him into thinking he may lose everything in the event of a divorce) I'd do this via couples counselling because there is two aspects of your relationship here that you both need to work through. Your fear of rejection and abandonment (I feel you) and his fear or commitment. If you work through it with a professional you may both come to the conclusion that you're happy and secure just loving each other and living each day as it comes, and he's happy to trust that one day, when he feels ready he can commit without fear. Both are deep rooted issues that can't be resolved sat crying on each other as you both have very opposing views at the moment.",
            "Hi OP, I\u2019m sorry you are in this situation. I\u2019m sure it hurts a lot. First off, I don\u2019t think your relationship needs to end over this one fight but I do think there are two questions you are your boyfriend need to discuss. \n\nThe first question is: is he against marriage or is he unsure of marrying you? Your boyfriend might not believe in marriage or maybe he is just uncomfortable with the legalities of it. If he loves you and talks about a future with you, then what does that actually look like? Does he want to have kids with you? Does he was to buy a house with you? Does he want to grow old with you? He should have a pretty good idea of these things five years into a relationship. If he\u2019s unsure about those things (aside from marriage) then he\u2019s probably not sure if you are the one, and that is a different conversation. \n\nIf he does see all those things happening with you, then you need to ask yourself if you can commit to him without marriage. Do you see yourself growing old with someone without being married? Is marriage a deal breaker for you? If you are concerned with this question, it might be best if y\u2019all seek out a couples therapist. \n\nI wish I could give you the magical answer to things OP. I hope things work out and you end up in a happy place for yourself.",
            "Do NOT make any big decisions right away. While you\u2019re both emotionally fragile us not the time to make any life altering decisions. Instead I would give both of you time to breathe and then ask him to tell you more. Not like demanding he \u201cjustify\u201d himself but more asking him to help you understand. He\u2019s got to be able to say more about why he\u2019s so scared of marriage, what does he think marriage is? What does it mean to him? What is he so afraid is going to happen? Have the two of you ever talked in depth about what marriage actually means to you from the emotional commitment pov, or even how you would bring assets to the marriage? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually a huge surprise he has these reservations given you said he\u2019s gotten lots if \u201cstrong advice\u201d about protecting his assets, which could have made him develop negative associations with marriage around things like fear of loss of control, or being taken advantage of, exacerbated by childhood abuse. Just take a moment. Stop any assumptions you might be making right now. You\u2019re now on a fact finding mission together. You\u2019re working on this together searching for clarity. It may turn out he actually doesn\u2019t want to get married and you do have to break up eventually. But don\u2019t make that decision immediately while a) you\u2019re both emotionally all over the place and b) you haven\u2019t really explored all the information or understood the root of the feelings at play.",
            "Divorce can really fuck a child up. Although you can personally relate, his and your own experience are probably quite different.\n\nIt's a good thing that he has opened up to you, even if it was quite charged and intense. He's 25, I have to marvel at how immature and naive I was at that age, despite thinking I was a fully formed adult. Growing up takes time, especially if there is unprocessed trauma (there usually is).\n\nThis is likely a good thing for him, for both of you. It sounds like he has some insecurities and is still traumatised from his parents divorce. My advice would be to just go slow, give him some space. He will come to you when he's ready. Maybe gently mention the divorce of his parents and the role that could play, and I would suggest some therapy. Good luck.",
            "OP, I am sorry that you\u2019re going through this. I can see why you feel like the rug has been pulled out from underneath you, but I do not think all is lost.\n\nAs others have already recommended, I would strongly encourage you and your boyfriend to seek couples and individual counseling. It seems clear that the idea of marriage is bringing up a tremendous amount of fear and anxiety for your boyfriend. I would imagine that as you are both getting older, marriage feels less like a romantic fantasy and is suddenly more \u201creal\u201d to him - and is stirring all kinds of unresolved issues, thoughts, and feelings in the process. \n\nThat said, given your own history, I would be surprised if you don\u2019t have your own complex associations with marriage. In this post, you seem to have a very positive - and possibly idealized - view of what the future may look like when you are married. But I wonder if you may have some of your own fears and anxieties around this issue lying beneath the surface. \n\nFrom your post, I get the sense that you and your boyfriend have a wonderful and trusting relationship. I think there is a good chance you can work through this together, particularly if you have the assistance of a good counselor.",
            "After dating my partner for 1.5 years he hadn't said I love you. When we talked about it he said \"I don't think I ever will\" not even about me, just about the concept of love. I broke up with him because I believe that when someone tells you something you should believe them. We ended up breaking up for 3 months where he talked to friends and family and realized what I knew, thag he did love me but just didn't really know what that meant. Three years later we are now talking about marriage, taking it slowly. \n\nMy strategy at the time was to tell him to think about it, give him some time and then have a discussion about it when we were ready. He told me that and so I ended it. I think that was 100% the right thing to do, he told me so I had to believe him. I didn't expect to get back together, I was ready to accept that we just weren't meant to be and I wasn't going to waste my time in that way. \n\n\nMy opinion is: give him a bit of time. A bit. It's up for you to decide how long, but if it's important to you I imagine it always will be and if he doesn't want it then you just aren't meant to be. No one is \"not good enough\" you just want different things (in that scenario) and that sucks but you'll be happier long term finding someone who has the same values.",
            "I don\u2019t have any advice to give, but this really struck a chord with me, because pretty much the same thing happened to me with my ex. We were together for three years before breaking up. It was like it all happened at once that it came out that he didn\u2019t want to get married, we had talked about it and fantasized about it for two years but the last year was a lie, for a whole year. He was hiding that he didn\u2019t want to marry me, but still trying to work through those emotions and basically staying with me to try to bring back those feelings in himself. I was absolutely devastated when out of the blue he basically took off and left me in an empty apartment while I was sleeping. We hadn\u2019t even fought. Everything was so good (I thought). I found out later that he knew for a whole year that he didn\u2019t want to marry me anymore. We tried working it out and took a break and tried getting back together, but it failed. I hope it works out for you, and that he comes to realize marriage is a positive thing and that you\u2019re the one.",
            "Breathe, OP. \n\nAs a married woman whose husband took more time to get to that conversation, here's my stance (which you may not like): you're both overreacting to the idea of marriage (and to not getting married), which tells me neither of you are ready to take action. Which is OK! \n\nBut please remember: feelings are not facts. Your world is not ending, your relationship is not a disaster, and this is actually a wonderful (albeit difficult) conversation you're having. Those conversations are what will show you if you can make a marriage with this person. \n\nYour boyfriend sounds like he's realizing that a breezy \"yes, I'd love to marry you\" does not itself make a marriage. That's a wonderful realization! I know some couples who are realizing that now (having been married for a few years) and who are, consequently, on their way to divorce. \n\nMy advice for you: set boundaries around what you want. \n\nAre you OK being with a partner who, as of today, is unsure on marriage?\n\nAre you wanting to be engaged (action, not conversation) within a certain timeframe? \n\nAre you wanting to be married (action, not conversation) within a certain timeframe? \n\nThere's no \"right\" response to this, OP, just the response that is right for you.",
            "I think maybe in the immediate hurt some relevant elements in your post may not have been given the appropriate level of importance to your understanding of the situation. Namely that you both come from divorced homes, and your partner spent his youth being heavily warned against the concept of marriage, and it sounds like the both of you had rough childhoods in some form or another.\n\nYour boyfriend didn't just randomly turn into someone who isn't communicative or loving or kind, and you didn't do anything wrong either. As much as you two may have put in the work to become healthier people, with a genuinely loving and respectful relationship... that doesn't mean what you dealt with just disappears, or will never come up in an unpleasant way. Or to put it more bluntly, you both clearly still have some unhealthy stuff going on around relationships, but that doesn't mean your relationship itself is unhealthy.\n\nI don't know the histories the two of you have had, but what you described your boyfriend doing in response to dealing with the possibility of a serious relationship issue? While I might be wrong, from my distance that sounds like conflict avoidance. Yes, its troublesome. Yes, it might feel unfair because you've done nothing to earn mistrust. Yes, its a blindside. But if the answer here is that your boyfriend had that response out of fear, and the after effects of how he was raised? Thats a thing that calls for personal therapy, maybe couples therapy for the two of you - but its not the death knoll for a relationship. It's very possible he didn't know he had this issue around marriage, and why would he? Its not a going to be a continual trigger or issue the way loud voices or the like are. Not all learned reactions are easily spotted, nor all fears.\n\nYou also are very clearly devastated by the whole thing to the point of physical illness, which isn't normal. The fact that this has put you in a place of such extreme emotional upheaval makes me think that you are also responding from a space of fear and learned reaction too. You say that you've had unhealthy relationships before, and I think if you go through enough  abuse in life, any kind of conflict starts to feel like sirens. The fact that you didn't expect it, that you thought you were finally beyond it and in a \"healthy\" space, makes it feel like a betrayal even if in reality his whole breakdown really has more to do with him and an inability to process his own emotions on the matter. \n\nBut I think that sometimes, when we get to a better place in our recovery, and finally have people who actually care, we think its all over. We are healed, healthy, recovered - so it will always be a surprise when you find that as far as you move away from the past, the healing continues. I think that sometimes when you spend so long struggling against truly terrible things, we come to find that we don't know how to respond on a more modulated level to the more... mundane awful things. We go into fight or flight mode without knowing how to stop and actually deal with the situation in front of us.\n\nUnfortunately, I really do think its the old case of when you've resolved one layer of issues and think you're clear, surprise! There's actually multiple layers of issues and they tend to get more esoteric the further you go. Genuinely, the best response you could probably give is something acknowledging how he feels, mentioning that his response to those emotions being to hide and bottle it up may mean that its an issue that actually needs some internal work to resolve, and that the two of you don't need to decide what getting married or not means for the two of you until you are both in a better space for it. I'd make sure to mention that the whole thing set off some things for you, and while not intentional it did leave you with some hurt, and that whatever you need... reassurance about the state of your relationship, couples therapy, etc, would be appreciated.\n\nLet things settle for the day, let the storm pass, and work through your emotions as best you can without giving into the temptation to drown in them. Once things are more stable, you can figure out what you need, what you actually want, and what to do next. Maybe you two go to therapy and realize the issue is something else tied up in marriage and that you two can resolve that. Maybe marriage isn't on the table. You might be okay with that, or not. But you have to let the both of you take a moment to come down off the emotional negative high, and get your heads about you so you can rely on the things you value so much in your relationship: an open dialogue, kindness even in tough times, and a commitment to understanding.\n\nBest of luck.",

Marriage with prenup? Kids at all at some point? Don\u2019t agree to anything you don\u2019t want to do just to keep him.

Next, like someone else was saying, maybe since you guys have been together since early twenties, maybe he has outgrown the relationship. The thought and sight of other couples getting engaged is putting pressure on him. He knows he doesn\u2019t want to go there \u201cyet\u201d\nReally, truth probably is, he no longer wants to get married to YOU. You have to be ready to mentally handle that. If it feels like its just excuses(money when he has money, job when he has a good job, connections, Age, ect) TAKE IT AT FACE VALUE. he most likely realized HE doesn\u2019t see himself marrying YOU (Anymore)\nIt hurts to lost something that has been a part of your life for so long but who knows.

You can\u2019t change his stance on it, that\u2019s all on him. \n\nThe question is are you ok with waiting around for someone who probably won\u2019t change their mind? You two sound quite codependent on each other that it\u2019s causing you physical pain. I\u2019ve been through that too. Take a step back and reevaluate the present and what the future looks like. Your partner should not be terrified or marrying you after for so long.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m gonna add that I\u2019ve seen this played out before. If he marries her down the road it\u2019s not likely to last. Idk why exactly but sometimes people look for a fresh start when overcoming trauma. So they look elsewhere. Or he may never change his mind and op will be happy as long as she\u2019s with him for while. Until she starts seeing her friends get married, people ask when she\u2019s next, but she knows she won\u2019t be. There will be people bringing up examples of how their similar relationship worked out  - yeah they\u2019re the exception not the rule. Don\u2019t ever assume your situation will be the exception because it likely won\u2019t.",
            "I'm really sorry you're going through this. What he said could be a lot of things like fear of missing out, emotionally checking out of a relationship a while ago, thinking of someone else/an ex, commitment issues, traumatized childhood, self-sabotage..\n\nAnd what you should do next depends on the reason. You should have a calm, collected conversation with him about it explaining that while it was shocking, you appreciated the fact that he was honest and that it's only fair to continue to be honest and to communicate openly on ''why''. Ask him if it's one of the options above. Also I'd suggest a break from him, I know it'll be extremely hard taking one when you're feeling vulnerable and anxious. But it's needed so he (and you) could evaluate your feelings and desires. \n\nIf you get married when he's in this mental state, he'd be miserable and he'd make you miserable. He'll always blame you for forcing it on him, because in his head, it went like that. So really, it's a good thing he was open about what he's thinking.",
            "The ball is currently in your court.  You have to have a long hard think about if you\u2019d be ok never getting married to stay with him, or if a future marriage is important enough to you to warrant a break up with your current partner.  I\u2019ve been with the same guy for almost 14 years, but that\u2019s because I decided that I didn\u2019t care enough about marriage to end the relationship since we weren\u2019t going to have children.  You have to decide what\u2019s best for you.  He\u2019s essentially told you that he will most likely never marry you, now you need to decide what you want.  These things happen in life, especially as you mature in a relationship.  Breakups don\u2019t have to be because something bad happened, sometimes you just realize that you want different things for your future.

            "Hi OP. \n\nYour partner has had an extreme response to what many would consider a common progression in a relationship. The willingness to lie in order to maintain his comfort is a serious problem and simply wrong because it prevented you from being able to make informed choices. This lie denied you your autonomy, and was instrumental in causing the current damage.\n\nYou also had an extreme response to the loss of that same relationship progression. \nI don't judge your response to this turmoil, because this situation is devastatingly painful and destabilising. I'm more concerned with whether the responses each of you have are *useful*. \n\nYou can put the issue of marriage on hold for the time being, contingent on both of you engaging in regular individual counseling for yourselves. Once your individual therapists agree, couples counseling can be undertaken together. \n\nThe reason I think your therapists need to be part of the judgement about when couples counseling should begin, is because you both need to remember and internalise that you are two separate people who can be successful in life independent of each other. \n\nWhen two independent people come together, the life they build should be chosen because it *enhances* what they have as individual people, it doesn't *replace* who they are. When the life together is freely chosen without fear of loss controlling it, then it becomes two people working as a team and you are less likely to hesitate to express your needs fully. Fear blocks honest communication.\n\n>I\u2019d wait as long as he needs; but that I firmly didn\u2019t want to bring up the subject again until he was comfortable discussing it. I wanted to relieve the pressure on him, and I haven\u2019t mentioned it since. \n\nYou shouldn't need to hide yourself. *His desire to avoid is not more important than your desire to engage.* You stated your mindset very well, and it was up to him to state his own and address it. He can acknowledge your position without being in agreement with it - just as you did for him. Marriage as a concept could then have been discussed between you so understanding or compromise could potentially be reached; instead it was treated like a threat.\n\nYou were made to feel as though you were somehow in the wrong. Rather than address his state of mind, he allowed it to get to the point of implosion - and that is deeply unfair to you. \n\nRegardless of what he does or doesn't undertake, make some calls today and access counselling for yourself. Even if things were to suddenly return to the way they were before all this upset, you will still have the effects of this current event impacting you and how you move forward. \n\nPS. You are allowed to get angry. Anger can be a very useful emotion when you use it to motivate to take good care of yourself. It is not your responsibility to fix the damage between you and your partner - he threw the grenade so he can put in the effort of cleaning up the damage. For now you should focus on yourself, because a strong and focused You is going to most effective when addressing the present and near future. Keeping busy distracts the mind and allows it to do the necessary processing in the background. Work, friends, family - ask for their support and help keeping you occupied.\n\nBest wishes to you x",

Maybe it's the idea of commitment, or maybe it's the idea of commitment to YOU - he may still have it stuck in the back of his head that he's going to someday meet the  Nobel-prize winning heiress supermodel he *really* deserves. A lot of men in their 20s are happy to have a long-term girlfriend to dote on them and provide sex, cooked meals and a clean house - but in the back of their heads, they're secretly thinking, \"If I can land a babe like HER, who else could I get?\"\n\nSo. The question is not: how do YOU save this? The question is: is this good enough for you? Do you want to hang around with someone who has just blurted out that he LIED to keep you around and isn't sure if he'll ever want to get married? Don't buy into the \"sunk cost\" fallacy - you may have invested five years into the relationship, but do you want to invest another five? another ten? with a guy who just said he doesn't want to marry you?\n\nHey - maybe YOUR next boyfriend will be a Nobel-prize winning millionaire supermodel?\n\nIf I were you, I'd break up. Suggest he take time to figure out who he is and what he wants out of life - and you do the same. If five years of being together isn't enough to convince him how awesome you are, time to send him on his way. Maybe look into therapy yourself. Spend some time thinking about what YOU want. Think about the things you overlooked or minimized about him that actually, now that you think of it, really kind of... bugged you. Actually, there's that one thing? Yeah. That one really pissed you off. Why did you put up with that? OK, there's that other thing - that was a good quality - maybe look for that in the next guy.\n\nOh, and if he comes crawling back later (because nobody else wanted him and the supermodel did not materialize) - don't take him back.\n\nHell, I'm offended on your behalf now.",

Guys don't really think about marriage or what planning your life with someone looks like because society doesn't romantize marriage to the same extent from our perspective.

It does. Hands down and when I was about his age, I had a similar panic.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, you're both young. \n\nWhat helped me is that I don't want a wedding and I just want marriage with my boyfriend to be just about us and by our own rules.\n\nAnd time.

            "This is a tough situation OP.  Your BF clearly has a deep-seated visceral aversion to marriage. This is almost certainly due to long-running influence from his family. Having a few friends get divorced doesn\u2019t send you into weeklong panic attacks. The good news is that he must really love you, just as you describe - otherwise the thought of marriage would be easily dismissed, not terrifying. The bad news is that his aversion to marriage seems about as strong, again as evidenced by his reaction. \n\nUnfortunately for you, you\u2019re already married in your heart.  You speak with more love and commitment than many longtime spouses would.  That of course would be fantastic, *if you had the commitment that marriage demonstrates*.  But you don\u2019t, and you\u2019re feeling how much you depended on that commitment now. My heart aches to think of how painful this is for you. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to say how this will turn out. How is *your* relationship with *his* family?  They are sadly your likely opponents in this quest for lifelong commitment. I would suspect that their opposition is more general, and not specific to you - otherwise they\u2019d be just badmouthing you, and not the institution of marriage in general. Can you bring them around?  I don\u2019t know. It might be easier than trying to bring him so far from his current state into confronting his family on his own. At the same time, action by you could easily reinforce some mistaken \u201cgold digger\u201d perception they have.\n\nTherapy could work. I\u2019d consider this a somewhat more pressing matter than others have suggested.  Unless you\u2019re sure you never want children, you should be establishing that relationship now. If he\u2019s not the one, you have to decide if giving up children is the right call. You could rush things later, but that\u2019s not at all ideal. \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that you\u2019re so devastated because you\u2019ve become so bonded to him, under what turns out to have been a false sense of mutual commitment.  You may try to back off in order to protect yourself. Not break up, necessarily, but understanding that living together as a couple has both led you to a position of extreme vulnerability while making the actual commitment of marriage seem less necessary for him. \n\nI\u2019ve watched several friends wait and wait, hoping a partner would come around. I\u2019m still waiting for any of them to come around. I hope things turn out better for you.",

            "A lot of commenters have touched on good points about trauma and input from people in his friend groups, which could all be contributing to this. \n\nI'd focus on the other side of it: the difference between \"a life partnership that is recognized by your local laws and confers benefits and obligations\" that he might be totally fine with, and the 'getting married' he may be afraid of which is \"being the centre of attention of family and friends at an expensive event that has to be planned out and paid for and has to go perfectly and if he anything doesn't go right he disappoints you forever\". Because I have been in that state twice: once was because I couldn't see the relationship going further (because it was unhealthy and abusive), but another time because my anxiety creeps up on me and we didn't communicate super clearly and now I'm over that fear because we understand each other better and can actually move towards a \"getting married\" that doesn't scare us.\n\nOnce you're both in a calm state consider talking about the types of partnership you can have: in my country we have what's known as commonlaw relationship where people are assumed to have the same level of everything as a married couple if they live together long enough in a partnership, maybe just setting a long engagement is the answer, or you could simply go to the courthouse/city hall in some cute clothes with a friend or two and sign marriage papers together, maybe just a tiny intimate ceremony with a small circle is something you can agree on, maybe it has to be an event to be a marriage, maybe you drive off to a town you don't know anyone in and get a cheesy ceremony from a person dressed like a famous musician - maybe you'd want to combine things like elope for a legal wedding and then do a whole ceremony and party much later when finances and jobs and social situations allow it.\n\nTalk to each other and hear each other out: don't use shortcut terms while you're doing it, explain out what you hope for or what you can accept for how long and what your fears and reservations are. It's a hard conversation and you might not leave with the answer you want but you will at least understand each other and know if you can keep going or not.",

            "Two things to think about here. First is his thing around marriage. I don't know what it is, but some people don't like the idea of marriage. I don't; to me marriage is about how society needs to know which man owns a woman, and I don't want to be owned (or to be a woman, as it turns out, but that's not relevant here). His hangups are his own, and probably aren't the same as mine, but the main thing to take away is that it very much sounds like they are a *him* issue. I'm not reading anything that says he doesn't want to be with you, he's just really shook up about the m-word.\n\nSecond thing, though: he's willing to lie to you rather than have hard discussions. This is a big problem. You think you've had really good communication and problem solving, but how do you know he hasn't just been lying about being okay with other things because he's afraid of your disapproval? In my experience with this kind of thing, it *definitely* comes from childhood trauma, but it is *very* hard to get the person to see that the issue is not *whatever they were lying about* but the fact that they were lying. In their mind, they had to lie in order to avoid conflict, because conflict is synonymous with emotional or physical abuse. Then, when the lie comes out, really bad conflict ensues, and they conclude that they were right: they needed to lie in order to preserve the relationship, because it feels to them like the conflict is about the thing they lied about, rather than the fact they lied.\n\nIt's a tricky balance to get a person like this to feel safe enough in a relationship that they don't feel like they have to lie and squash issues until they boil up like this, while also not letting yourself become their doormat. You also have to figure out how to come back from being lied to from a trust perspective. Maybe you can do it, with counselling.",
            "I'm curious, why did he go to his mother's? I think the deeper concern here is that he may have a habit of saying what people want to hear, especially people he loves. It sounds like his drive to not hurt your feelings is extremely high, so he reassures you, validates you, meets your emotional needs, even if that is not what he really thinks and feels. I can't imagine that his terror about getting married is the only thing he has hidden because he didn't want to hurt you. More that is was so intense he couldn't keep it to himself anymore. I think you would both get tremendous benefit from individual therapy. As he learns to be more authentic, couples therapy could provide a format that makes him feel safer being genuine about what he thinks and feels, especially when he knows it's something you won't be happy to hear.\n\nThe silver lining here is that he definitely loves you and is desperate not to hurt you. Perhaps this is an opportunity for him to learn that avoiding uncomfortable conversations causes far more pain than having them right away. From the intensity of your reaction, and given you were raised in an abusive situation, I can only assume you have a deep fear of abandonment. That might end up being a major struggle for you, to not be overwhelmed by that fear when he has to be honest about something that might sting. You'll both have to learn new relationship skills together. He has to find the courage to be honest about things that might hurt you, and you have to learn to manage any fears or insecurities his honesty might trigger. You'll have to be courageous together.",
            "This SUCKS. I fear you've put him on a pedestal, but he's a coward who's too chicken to do the right thing and break up with you. Thus the tears.

He obviously has some deeply seeded fears about commitment.  If you want to salvage this, he\u2019s got to want to get some help with it.  So far, he\u2019s actively been deceiving you to give you what you want.  He\u2019s going to have to do some deep introspection to figure out what he wants and why he\u2019s so afraid of the \u2018M\u2019 word.

            "When things blindside you, it's because you have a blind spot. It's never nice to have to admit it, and especially uncomfortable when someone else points it out.\n\nYou've written 10 or so paragraphs about why this wasn't your fault. Each paragraph is effectively a mini treatise about why a certain point was the fault of your partner and how you were the innocent party.\n\nI'm not saying you're a bad person, and please don't take this as just an attack, it isn't. I really do wish you well, and I'm sorry to hear about your circumstances; which are certainly distressing for you both.\n\nThis is your blind spot.\n\nFrom what I've read, and it's striking similarities to other relationships I've known, personally and of friends, I would say that you hate being wrong. You cannot hear no and although you are not an aggressive person, you've mastered the ability to passively shut down anything that you do not want to do, see or hear. You have convinced yourself that you and your partner are very open, but this is not true, you just act like you're open and honest with each other. What this actually has become is that you are open about when you don't like things, and your partner agrees, because it is the course of least resistance and confrontation. Your partner, over the years will have habitualised agreeing and hiding his true feelings, because he has learned that you will shut him down, one way or the other. He will only raise issues, if he feels they are non-contentious subjects. When he does his own thing regardless you will call him selfish. Your overall view of him was that he could be selfish from time to time and that you had to stand up for yourself - although the opposite is most likely truer.\n\n*Let me reiterate - you're not a bad person*. I sincerely doubt you do any of the above intentionally. If you want my advice, it would be to start getting better at hearing no, both literally, and figuratively. Be aware that you have a tendency to react to things you don't want to hear in a way that discourages people from being honest with you, and instead try to welcome uncomfortable conversations. Actively practice humility around those you love. Embrace the fact that you are likely wrong, far more often than you are right, and that you have a lot to learn from the people around you than you currently think. Acknowledge that you are selfish, and not as great a person as you think, and that you could do with giving a little more, not less; even if this is wrong, it's no bad thing to believe.\n\nIt's not all on you, your partner certainly needs to grow a backbone and start saying what he truly believes more - but since you can't change his personality, and can only change yourself, don't dwell on what _he_ should do; it's largely out of your hands.\n\nThe problem with winning every argument is that you end up living in a false reality, and then when you least expect it, the rug gets pulled. I wish you good luck for the future and hope you can work this out. \n\nI'm sure this comment will attract loads of raging karens because I didn't simply agree and blame your partner, but please do reach out if you'd like to speak more. I've been through this on the other side, albeit a long time ago.",
            "You need to take care of yourself, dude.\n\nYou should not be spiking a fever because your boyfriend told you he isn\u2019t sure if he wants to get married. That\u2019s insane.",
            "I do not think your relationship is over even in the slightest. I mean I could be wrong, but here\u2019s my take. I understand how you feel and why, but I truly think it\u2019s a hurdle in the road. You guys have a healthy respectful partnership, love each other, and want to be together. \nHis opening up to you sounds like nothing more than a trauma response to me - triggered by being around the soon-to-be married couple. I experience similar triggers & reactions - and yep, they\u2019re coming from a deeper place of a traumatized younger me. A lot of people who watched their parents relationship fall apart have deep down fears around marriage and the same thing happening to them when they sign the papers. I am sure it\u2019s hard for you as someone who has dreamed about it, and jolting that he has said it and now taking it back. But I think it would be healing for both of you if try to show him that you understand where these fears come from and won\u2019t judge him for them. You just want to work through them. You are hurt that he mentioned marriage all this time, which is valid and he should apologize for, but I think it\u2019s also worth understanding that this wasn\u2019t malicious or sinister on his end. I think he / you guys should seek counseling over this topic, and it can be smoothed over with time, openness, & willing to understand each other\u2019s thoughts/fears/needs around this. Maybe not, but from your post I think the odds are in your guys favor. It\u2019s possible that you guys could heal from this together and come out stronger than ever",
            "Also in the therapy camp - because not being able to communicate about such an important issue is a serious problem in a relationship. He didn\u2019t tell you how he was really feeling so you could have what you want? Only to pull the rug out from under you now? He\u2019s missing some adult skills.",
            "It sounds like when he defined his self-image as a man, and would-be husband, he mixed in cultural values based on gender roles, expectations of performance, class consideration, and so on. That\u2019s natural\u2014everyone does that to some degree.\n\nThat said, he\u2019s at an age where he is realizing that to fully become who he is, he must relinquish the things he is not. And to the degree his self-image contains things he is not, he will feel unsure, afraid, lost\u2014that he doesn\u2019t know who he is, or what he wants\u2014and that he is vulnerable\u2014if he were to remove those things. And he must, if he is to become the man he is, instead of the one he was told to be.\n\nThis takes time. A person has to grow into the gaps created by removing those things untrue. Growth is never comfortable, because it is not easy. It requires us to be present and engaged to our deepest levels, and it requires our genuine efforts and struggle to change and adapt, to learn a better way, and to integrate those things into how we live and love.\n\nHe could not reveal to you what he wanted to escape from in himself. Especially because this culture would shame him as a man for those thoughts and feelings. Especially because he thought having them might mean you would love him less.\n\nSo you must address the shock to the relationship caused by this witness of self. The previous we is gone, but now you have an opportunity to know and be known, more authentically\u2014an opportunity to achieve a deeper intimacy.\n\nMy sense is his deceit was not one of willful intention, but one born of ignorance and fear. So in this you may still trust his feelings toward you, even if he does not trust himself.\n\nThis relationship is based on things that make it fundamentally solid and strong. It is no less so for this having happened. You love this man, and he loves you. You are best friends with this man. He\u2019s come to a point where he must choose to become the man he really is, and he is scared, bewildered, and trying to figure out how to do that and not lose you, or himself, in the process. That\u2019s a lot to ask of a 25-year-old. I\u2019m quite sure I would be a hot mess were I 25 again and in his shoes.\n\nDon\u2019t doubt yourself, as you did nothing wrong. I hear that you are crushed, anxious, and afraid. I\u2019m sorry this is where you are right now. But do not despair, and do not lose hope.\n\nYour relationship is not so easily undone, if you are indeed best of friends. Your trust in one another, willingness to communicate, avoid judgment, be vulnerable, and the love you share\u2014those things will see you through this, if that is what you both want.\n\nTogether you will both let go of what you had previously imagined, and together you will discover the future you agree to create together.\n\nI\u2019m in a relationship with my best friend, and I will just say this: I\u2019d prefer to die before I would give up on what we have created together. I would do whatever was required to remain by her side, such is my love for her.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to do what is required in your case. Love him and yourself, trust him and yourself, be the friends to one another that you are. Be patient, and be kind, with him, and with yourself.\n\nIt\u2019s WTF?! time. I get that. But I don\u2019t think you are at risk of losing anything unless you choose to embrace Fear. Courageous people feel the fear, but they choose to embrace Love. Love will see you through this. Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.\n\nChoose it. You can have a relationship that is amazing and healthy on a level previously unknown to you. This is not a time of loss. This is a time of growth. Of reward.\n\nBut only if you want it and only if you choose it. Use your gifts and your skills. Trust yourself. Trust what you share with one another. That you feel doubt is okay because it will pass. This is worth fighting for. Don\u2019t fret. Connect, and dare to live your dreams.\n\nYou don\u2019t know this, but you got this. Believe that. Relationships require the most of us, and they can be so worth it. It\u2019s big girl panties time. Go forth and claim him. This chaos will surely pass. I have reason to think you two have what it takes to weather the storm.\n\nI wish you the best.",

            "Tell him that getting married doesn\u2019t have to be big and scary, it can honestly be seen as just a legal document which will protect you both. It\u2019s also good for tax reasons in maaaany countries. Doing a court house wedding doesn\u2019t have to be so bad.\n\nI think his fear of marriage could stem from his parent\u2019s divorce. Maybe he sees marriage as what killed a loving relationship and broke two people. Or something like that. No wonder it terrifies him, if so. He needs therapy if this is the reason. Maybe couple\u2019s therapy too, so you can show him what you want, and why you want it, and you guys can compromise together.\n\nMind, I\u2019d never have given up being married for anyone. I gave my hubby a deadline relatively early on (say, a year in, I said I want to get married before I\u2019m X years old - we did get married a year later than that though, because the venue was fully booked, but we were engaged 2 years before that).",
            "> Both of our parents are divorced and his come from money. He got a lot of strong advice growing up not to marry young and to protect his assets, to see it from a more financial view than I ever have thought of it.\n\nIt sounds like he has spent so much of his life with a negative view on marriage that he's lost the ability to see it as in any way good. I'd also bet that his friends aren't beacons of marriage stability, either; 25 is around the time where College romance marriages start to crash and burn, at least in the Bible Belt ime. It could be that your escalating talk of marriage (even if couched in maturity and respect for his feelings), paired with an increase in negative examples from his peers, has led to his perspective on marriage souring over time rather than softening.\n\n>  I don\u2019t think he has put any kind of mature thought into marriage at all. It was like talking to a scared child.\n\nI get that you're shocked and upset, but you aren't distilling his arguments, you're belittling them. Your definition of \"mature thought into marriage\" might be slightly more rational than his, but to completely throw away his take as the whimpering of \"a scared child\" isn't going to help bridge the divide in your relationship.\n\nHis perspective of marriage is likely entirely centered around the examples he's had of it throughout his life (which haven't been super positive iirc). In his head, marriage is a weapon two people who no longer love each-other use to inflict maximum damage on one-another. He hasn't seen two healthy, well-adjusted adults in a trusting, communicative partnership exchanging vows of service and self-sacrifice to one-another. \n\nIn a way, I can totally see why he'd freak out about marriage at that point, not that I agree with his perspective. He loves you and your relationship, and doesn't want to lose it. However, he also views marriage as an endless morass of darkness and suffering. So when you ask him about marriage, he hears: \"Hey, how would you feel about ruining this thing you love so much?\" *But he knows that saying no would also ruin the relationship, so he just keeps on moving forward hoping things don't reach that tipping point.*\n\nIf you really care about the relationship, and think that he really does too, some couples therapy might be useful to help unpack and share your perspectives with each-other in a more constructive manner. If you think he's just leading you on and wasn't sincere when trying to save things *sans marriage*, then I'd start to take a long hard look at how important marriage is to you. Wanting to marry your partner isn't an unreasonable thing to want, but it might be an incompatible thing with this guy.",

            "This sucks but it's also fairly straight forward.  Your boyfriend and you, in your mid twenties, have realized you have a major incompatibility going forward, and it's very clear he's put significant effort into wanting to get married but it's not happening; I'm imagining you would similarly not be able to change your mind about wanting marriage (although obviously something to confirm for yourself).  A shitty outcome, but it's part of dating. And truthfully I can't pass too much judgement on him, many 23/24 year olds may say they want to get married because \"it's what people do\" and don't really think it through; he might just as easily have actually gone through with getting married and unleashed a miserable divorce on you a decade from now, which would be far worse.\n\nYou should breakup and find someone who wants to marry you.  You're very young and you will be able to find an even better match than your current BF.",
            "As hard as it feels I would advise you both to not get as hung up on marriage. He seems to be carrying lots of trauma about the idea of marriage bottled up that needs to be addressed in order to heal. It seems you might be carrying some trauma about marriage and romantic attachment too, which as a child of divorced parents is perfectly normal.\n\nTake faith, although this is thoroughly unfun both of you reacted in a perfectly normal way to this stress. I see no red flags for your relationship, and once you recover you'll be stronger and better for it. I would caution against any rash changes like separation, commitments, ultimatums, or other decisions until you've both had time to think through and talk through your feelings.\n\nIt sounds like both of you struggle with anxiety outside of this incident, and would benefit from individual therapy regardless. I found your comment about taking lots of sleeping pills quite concerning, but as someone who's also suffered anxiety driven insomnia I understand why you'd want that. You need to reach out to your network for support in this rough time and take care of yourself, be extra gentle and kind to yourself. Hopefully your partner will be doing the same. Don't avoid contacting but don't use him as an external comfort. Strengthening your self soothing skills will in the long term make you a better, happier person as well as partner.",

Unless you have some strong religious belief around it, there's absolutely no reason to throw away a good relationship because you don't technically have a piece of paper saying you're married.",

My wife and I dated for 7 years before I proposed to her and we were living together for most of that time.  I saw a lot of married couples lives completely turned upside down by divorce and I didn't see the point in getting married.  I loved her the entire time and had every intention of spending the rest of my life with her but I had reservations about tying our finances together and being legally married.  I was given several ultimatumes over the years and we did separate for awhile but we eventually reconciled and after spending 7 years with her I decided to propose.  We did actually go through a prenuptial agreement and got married over 12 years ago.  We are still happily married and have a daughter together.  I wouldn't change anything.\n\nNow that I've told you my story I think you really need to understand what your boyfriend's reservations are and see if there is a way to work it out.

I don\u2019t know that as many men would get married if they knew that their girl would just be with them. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s as important to us if we have you already.\n\nI think the best thing you can do if he is the one is just be the one for each other.

I still do, because I've done the same and it's understandable if you're scared and not mature yet. But that doesn't make it ok...",
            "Dear God in heaven, that was me except we'd only been together for like 6 mo. (Please don't focus on how long we'd been together.)  I was happily planning my wedding. He had said he wanted to. I had talked about it, never realizing he wasn't as active in those conversations. It was going to be my dream wedding. We were in the car one day, and he said he never wanted to marry again after his divorce. My world crumbled. This was my dream and he took it away. I became abusive and punished him because it was his fault. We broke up, except not really. We still talked, I still went to his house for the weekend. I still loved him. We decided to get back together,  and I thought I could change his mind later. I still wasn't a good person and did some horrible things.\n\nI'm not going to tell you what happened after. That's not what this is about. You have 3 options. \n\n1) You stay with him and hope to change his mind later.\nBad idea. You both have opposing needs, and that will turn into resentment because you will submentally push for what you want, and he will get angry at you for not respecting his boundaries. That's a messy breakup and a lot more heartache. \n\n2) You decide to skip the marriage part, and give that dream up. You never bring it up, not even one single hint and you get help to close that chapter in your life. I've had to do this myself and accept he won't always be what I need, but the good times balance that need, sometimes. \n\n3) You break up. Now, this decision will be painful at first, but you'll heal. You have a very fundamental difference of values, and you should find someone who wants to marry. \n\nI recommend the 3rd one. 1 and 2 aren't great choices. 1 leads straight to resentment. 2 can be like a 1000 paper cuts, and, even though you've grieved, there will be moments that you want that piece of you back. \n\nDo yourself, and him, a favor and rip the band-aid off. Walk away and block him on everything. Grieve, and find someone that loves you and wants to marry you. Work on making yourself whole. Hugs.",
            "Uh ok I'll add another perspective here, maybe his fear is spiking and he's not handling it well and just saying some scary shit that he doesn't mean. That's happened to me before. It's possible he tapped into some deeper trauma that he didn't realize was there and it's making his head go for a loop. When that happens, he could have no idea what he's saying. The crying all week thing could be a signal of some childhood stuff. People, even the people we cherish... have their crazy parts to them. Crazy here meaning they think things that aren't fixed to reality. We all have those parts. That being said, if you're not trained in handling this stuff you're going to go crazy trying to figure it out. So he should probably find someone to talk to with real training before he blows your lives up for a while.",

Breath! and try not to over stress, I know easier said then done, but you are making yourself sick, and thats not going to help anything.\n\nYour both still relatively young, and mentioned both your parents have divorced, That could be a factor for him, He probably has others in his ear to wait, dont marry, or play the field...\n\nNow, You need to make a few decisions , Is him not wanting to get married a deal breaker? could you be happy with out the marriage? what about if you have kids?\n\ngive him a few days to situate his thoughts in his head, let him know, you will give him time, and when ready, you can both sit and talk, I suggest going to a  area outside the house,  and both of you have a heart to heart, when he talks, you just listen, dont react, or talk, just let him, then when he is done, you talk,  even if you have to write out your thoughts, lay all cards on the table, \n\nwith the open communication that you have, there is a chance for things to work out,  and it will take work, love and Understanding.....I hope everything works out for the best for you both",

            "I proposed to my ex when I was 25--she was 30, and not very invested in marriage but was committed and said yes. I'm now realizing that I was so incredibly young then I wanted to solidify the good feeling the relationship gave me, so I kinda pushed forward with a wedding. We were married 7 years, 5 of which were good. Actually, we're still married at 9 years because divorce takes FOREVER. You're so, so young. I still feel like I don't know what I want at 37, because what I *felt* like I wanted at 25 melted and deformed into something that really started squeezing the life out of me.\n\nI don't think what I'm saying is going to make you feel any better... The grief over something being not what you were led to believe is astronomical. When I was dumped by surprise in my early 20s, the grief made me so physically sick that I lost 15lbs in two weeks. I wish I could spiritually put my arms around you and give you even an iota of comfort. I'm so sorry.",
            "OP I\u2019m wondering if the idea of a wedding is the thing that\u2019s terrifying, but not the marriage itself- sometimes it can be hard to tease out the two. If you\u2019re already living together, taking care of eachother, and relying on he eachother as a partnership, marriage doesn\u2019t change too much of the day to day things. \n\nPerhaps I\u2019m projecting, but my partner and I went through a somewhat similar thing a couple years ago. At the time I wasn\u2019t even ready to think about marriage as a possibility, so it was mostly just me calming him down lol but a couple years later when the subject came up again, we figured out it wasn\u2019t necessarily the marriage that overwhelmed him- but the idea of a wedding. Since then, I\u2019ve told him you I don\u2019t really care about the day and I\u2019d just as well elope. \n\nHe bought the engagement ring a couple weeks ago. Moral of the story- this doesn\u2019t have to implode the relationship, just continue being the supportive partner you seem like you are, and you\u2019ll be able to get to the root of this. Understanding where the fear is coming from is the first step.",

            "Sorry to hear this, but I think you guys are still in a good place. If he feels he can be honest with you and you\u2019re understanding with him, then you\u2019re in a healthy relationship it sounds like. I wonder if the way you guys talk about the future, if it\u2019s playful and he views it not as seriously as you do. Then when he is around an engaged couple it becomes more real for him. Maybe they were argumentative with each other he\u2019s worried it will happen to you, or he sees you just so happy and has concerns that he can\u2019t provide that to you? I think you guys could benefit from relationship counselling to deal with any traumas around relationships you\u2019ve developed from your families. I also think that you need to step back from the marriage talk and just relax and enjoy each other. You personally need to also make a decision, is marriage an absolute for you? If he is open to the idea, how long will you wait? Or if he says he doesn\u2019t know if he can ever do it but wants to be with you, are you fine living the married life without actually getting married? I think you need to figure out what you\u2019re willing to compromise on before the marriage conversation even begins again. It\u2019s unfair to both of you if you\u2019re expecting one thing but can\u2019t achieve it.\n\nIf you truly love him, then maybe you\u2019re open to living the lifestyle without doing the deed. And maybe if he loves you, he\u2019d be willing to work towards taking that step. But it\u2019s unfair for him to ask you to give that up if it\u2019s what you really want, and it\u2019s just as unfair to ask him to take that step if he can\u2019t. I hope you guys work out, your relationship is what I wish I had and it sucks that you\u2019ve hit this rough patch. The way I look at it, you two just need to be there for each other and continue to be supportive. To me, marriage is just a piece of paper and shouldn\u2019t be a requirement to show someone you love them.\n\nGood luck.",
            "Some individuals just don\u2019t want to get married for whatever reason.  I\u2019m not going to blame his parents divorce as that just usually causes bad relationship skill plus he used it as an excuse to not be straight with you.  It isn\u2019t either the right time or the right relationship or it just isn\u2019t a life goal of his.  It\u2019s extremely awful he didn\u2019t communicate this much sooner.  You didn\u2019t do anything wrong nor is there anything wrong with you.  This is his problem.  (Sadly he tried to make it your problem.) You deserve someone who values your time.  I would suggest you set some strong boundaries and move forward with your life.  He can join you if he wants but he probably won\u2019t join.  If you live together I will say breaking up is as painful as a divorce only without lawyers.  It hurts, but it does get better slowly but surely.  Many of us have been there and moved forward to someone better for us.  Also you don\u2019t need to compromise about your marriage belief it might mean your incompatible with him but it would be like compromising on the number of children that you want.",
            "I think the real question you have to ask yourself is: isnit really important to escalate a working relationship into a non working relationship?\n\nPlenty of people live un married, there's nothing wrong with that. If your relationship is perfect as it is, is it really essential to risk it to the point you will likely lose it? Or is it better with this men as it is rather than married with a potential douche?",

            "My husband and I have been married 15 yrs. We do not have shared finances, split everything 50/50, rent the same apt we moved into early on in our relationship and have a dog and a cat. *Nothing* has changed in our relationship between dating and marriage other than our taxes. We got married because we wanted to make a lifelong commitment to each other and share that dedication to each other with our closest friends and family on our wedding day.\n\nWhat is important are shared goals and how you two plan on achieving them. Do you want to have kids? Buy a house? Have one person work full time while the other person stays home and cares for the home/kids/land/animals/etc? Just as you said...this is about a partnership. You deserve a fully invested partner, whatever form that takes however you two feel it will work best for *both* of you. Do not compromise the things you want from this life because you're afraid of losing someone who isn't willing to commit to you.\n\nIf your bf has a psychological/emotional barrier built up around the word/concept of marriage, yet still wants to share a life with you, he needs therapy to figure out what's holding him back.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this OP. Your bf needs some space to figure his end of this out, and creating space and some independence for yourself would be a healthy step for you as well. \n\nWe can get so wrapped up in the semantics of these things, that sometimes we need to step back, take a breath, and recognize it's not all that complicated; It is truly about who you want to share your days and nights with.",
            "I had a full blown panic attack and went to the hospital after my GF and I talked about marriage.\n\nI think it was because my previous relationship was 7yrs, and my wife cheated on me, and now we share custody of our son.\n\nAnyway, my GF has now been my wife for over 3yrs. I dealt with my fears and spoke with a therapist.\n\nThings like this affect people differently.",
            "I haven't read all the responses. But really, you can't hang an entire relationship on something that was blurted out during a panic attack.\n\nEven in the most stable relationships, there's going to be some deep seeded doubts. Fears that could bubble to the surface (the ol' cold feet) to anyone. It's worth a discussion when cooler heads prevail - maybe even try some couples' therapy -  but I wouldn't scrap the relationship over this one incident.",
            "Ditto on the marriage counseling, but you all could consider a prenuptial agreement if that might ease his mind. It will cost some bucks as you\u2019ll both need your own lawyer, but they are very common.",
            "Well, as a guy who waited til well over 35 to get married, my take is this is totally an age thing. I wasn\u2019t ready at 25. Period.",
            "So I feel like a lot of guys have been where your BF is.  There are so many reasons, but rarely is one of them that he does not care for you, otherwise this would not torture him so. \n\nYou need to have a conversation with him about what he thinks marriage means.  What makes it different from being BF/GF forever, buying a house, and having kids (effectively common law)?  How he feels about his family's money and how it impacts and is impacted by marriage.  You should also take a close look in your soul at the differences between a common law relationship vs a marriage.  Some of the most rock-stable couples I know never got married but have been together for 20 years, and I know married couples that got divorced in 6 months. You need to really think about what that paper saying marriage really means to you. \n\nA lot of guys have a lot of hangups about what it means to be married.  For example, I felt like I needed to be prepared to provide for a family, even though my spouse worked.  In my mind, it was just one of the things that were my responsibility in life.  Since my career at the time was not going anywhere, all of my stress about that came out as stress about getting married.  Since \"that was the 1 thing I was supposed to do for a family, and I can't even do that\". \n\nThere are also lots of scary thoughts that go through most men's heads.  I think most women don't really realize the message men are fed all their lives about marriage through every media outlet we encounter.  Think about a sitcom, it's a miserable father who does nothing but work and a wife who basically just tolerates him for his money.  This is in stark contrast to the media message we feed girls, that's mostly about how amazing your wedding is and how everyone wants to fall in love and get married. \n\nMen are told to want to be married, we are told that this is the way of things, then literally every example we are shown is super toxic.  The whole divorce process is pretty unfair to men, in many cases (but not all) and it can really feel like you are signing a contract that is not all it's made out to be.  \n\nNext thing to remember.  This is sudden for you, but it's not for him.  For him, he's been feeling uncertain and scared for a while now and it's all just come out tonight.  So I totally understand being blindsided and how that must make you feel, but let's refocus on the important issue and not the \"where did this come from\" side.  That'll come with time.\n\nI'd bet if you really get him to open up about things you'll find a lot of ideas about what it means to be married that don't actually have to do with that.  He also likely has a lot of ideas about what it means to be a man tied up in there. \n\nAdd on top that he knows he's really hurting you and hates himself for it.  So it's like he's stuck between hurting you and lying to you and eventually, he just cracks and this is what happens. \n\nI really hope that you can talk him down and the two if you can have an actual conversation about the issue.  Just try to go into it with a fully open mind.",

No one likes to be rejected, no one likes rejecting someone, especially if they do in fact love them.   \n\nHe probably should\u2019ve said something right when you brought it up instead of blurting out the easier thing.

(You might even need to seek therapy yourself given your description of your reaction to the event.)\n\nUltimately, you need to ask yourself some questions - Can you be happy being with him and never being married?

That said, you should ask yourself if you can be happy in a relationship that might not end up in marriage. If it's a deal breaker for you, the \"why\" he doesn't want to get married doesn't really matter. \nHang in there, OP.

            "You\u2019ve been together since you were both basically 20 years old. Neither of you have had enough relationship experience, it\u2019s possible he is freaking out over that, the \u201cpermanence\u201d of marriage, finances, having kids, etc. I don\u2019t know anyone who got married at your age, literally everyone I know who is married did so in their 30s or later. Some good friends of mine have been together since their early 20s, been together for like 12-13 years and no intention of marrying any time soon. Ask yourself why \u201cgetting\u201d married is so important to you right now\u2014if the relationship is as healthy as you say it is, then it still should be regardless of whether or not y\u2019all signed some notarized documents.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that he\u2019s been in this relationship for so long that he is scared to leave it, or maybe knows he doesn\u2019t want to get married at all, or married to you, but doesn\u2019t have the experience points to open any of these discussions. \n\nBut at the end of the day, you say the relationship is great and you both love and support each other. What exactly is it about signing a piece of legal paper changes that for you? Is it symbolism of commitment? Is it a fantasy you\u2019ve always had? He already sounds committed to you, and you can have as many chickens as you want without being legally married for now. You both need to give it time, talk to a counselor both together and alone\u2014I suspect he has some unresolved trauma from his parents divorce, and that one or both of his parents may be cautioning him, especially if there was money involved.",
            "It sounds a bit to me like classic relationship anxiety. I\u2019ve struggled with it as well. Google Sheryl Paul for some information and resources. And send him some info. I recommend giving him some space and no major decisions\u2026 and find a good therapist for him and for you.",
            "I\u2019m 34. I come from a stable middle class family and know a number of long term marriages. \n\nThat aside, i\u2019m beginning to really hate this narrative about people who like the comfort of playing house, cohabitating, buying a dog, going on trips\u2026all up until the M word comes out. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of insulting that people think it\u2019s okay to take many of the benefits of commitment while they sit and assume it\u2019s not anything real until they decide to marry. You have been paying the emotional tax on a marriage-type-relationship he thinks he doesn\u2019t need but he wants to keep what he has with you. \n\nI think this is part of why your reaction has been so extreme. You\u2019ve been paying that tax for a while. Long term, i\u2019m worried about you paying that tax mostly on your own. \n\nRelationships are like a test drive. It\u2019s fine to take the time to shop for and decide on the *right* car. There\u2019s just no world where they let you test drive the car and keep it at home for years so you can make up up your mind while making sure no one else has a chance at it because it\u2019s in your drive way. \n\nI am not trying to disparage childhood trauma. But it is never an excuse to act that way.",
            "Personally, I don't care about marriage at all. To me it's just a party and a signature which can be undone with another signature. Not everyone will agree, especially there are religious factors at play. The only opinion I personally can have is that getting married makes no difference at all. If you both want to be together for the long run, there is nothing a slip of paper will do to ensure that happens. It might make one party feel trapped in the relationship if something changes, and obviously cost a ton of money to do (or undo), but in terms of how it affects your relationship in the long run, I see no benefit. A couple who are not married are no less valid than a couple who are.",
            "Consider and talk to him about this:\n\n1) Does he feel sure about your relationship? (Or is something troubling him?)\n\n2) Does he know that you are the person he wants to spend life with? \n\n**If he says yes to 1 and 2,  does it matter if you get married or not?** I'm from Europe. Here a lot of people skip marriage these days. They just cohabitate, buy a house together and have kids. No proposal, wedding or ring. And it works just fine.",
            "He is not scared of getting married. He is scared of making the commitment and having it not work out.\n\nMen experience anxiety too. Sound's like he is really invested in you, wants to protect you and himself. This man has a good heart.\n\nDo not think he is being disingenuous or dishonest with you, rather try and see from his perspective:\n\nHe clearly wants a long term relationship.\n\nHe clearly wants to be with you.\n\nHowever, what he is concerned about is getting married and having it not work out - that's completely rational.",
            "It\u2019s easy to talk about getting married. I think a lot of people get cold feet or some doubts when taking that next step. Marriage is seriously glorified and that can make it scarier. I would give him some space to think. My fianc\u00e9 and I are engaged and don\u2019t plan on getting married anytime soon. We\u2019re going to ride this part of our relationship out for a long time, lol.",
            ">my boyfriend of five years held in all his fears about marriage and commitment\n\nMarriage is not commitment, it's just a ceremonial bond. Why the fixation on marriage on your end? I come from a country where people typically don't marry, but live in domestic partnerships. I don't see myself getting married either, although I'm pretty upfront about that, unlike your boyfriend.\n\nTo me, a testament to a committed relationship is children. It's an irrevocable bond which truly requires contemplation, unlike marriages, about 50% of which end in divorce or separation in the US for example.",
            "Honestly, with no fault divorce being a thing, marriage doesn't exist anymore. What is called \"marriage\" these days is just dating but with extra financial liability for the partner who is wealthier. Look around this very subreddit for confirmation of that and see how many people dump their marriages of YEARS (sometimes with kids) over petty shit because random people on the internet convinced them that a minor spat was actually huge abuse. With people cutting out family, divorcing and dumping friends and loved ones over the most minor of things, not making that financial decision sadly is the smart choice. \n\nGiven his age, he also likely has friends who have either been divorced or are in shitty marriages right now. I guess what you need to do - if you wanna stay with him - is find out where he's coming from. If this is indeed the cause of worry because he saw too many cases of that, then there is an easy solution called a pre-nup. Have a lawyer draw one up that says that in case of divorce no party is entitled to anything the other brought into the marriage or gained from their own assets and work after the wedding. If you have kids and you both decide that you wanna go stay at home mom, you can even add a so called post-nup to make it so that if the marriage fails then, you'll be financially taken care of and all custody stuff is settled. Always best to settle these things \"just in case\" anyway, because if you settle them when you \"NEED\" to, both sides would be petty as shit.",
            "This may be a shot in the dark, but perhaps his issue is not having any fulfillment of his own; not in a relationship sense, but in a goals and carreer sense.\n\nHe did mention that he was worried about not being able to provide for you one day, maybe is his job that may be unstable and/or insufficient for a family and that is what is causing him this issue. Men are often more carreer-oriented than women so it would make sense if that was the issue.\n\nThe best course of action is talking about it at length; he trusts you, so he won't have a problem to tell you every detail, perhaps even a therapist may help identify the problem.\n\nCouples counceling and individual therapy may be what both of you need, to help going forward with your relationship. Please, do tell you counselor and his therapis to help you to move forward with your relationship, and pick apart your lives to identify and how to solve it. Also, consider a prenuptial agreement, to ensure your and his assets remain separate, just to build more confidence in marriage.\n\nMake sure to reach out for advice again, and update. If you wanna message me directly to talk more about this, go ahead, I'd be happy to help you in any way I can."

        "selftext": "My husband Derek and I have been married for 3 years, together for 7 total. \n\nSeveral years ago (about 6 now, I guess), I worked closely with a male coworker, Paul, that Derek was never fond of. Paul and I *never* had an inappropriate relationship. Derek's jealousy wasn't completely out of nowhere, I get why he felt that way. Those couple years were a perfect storm of relationship stress; I was working long hours, we were living apart after trying and failing to move in together, our relationship was still *fairly* new, and then you add in a handsome coworker I had to spend long hours with and saw more than my boyfriend at the time. \n\nPaul was the source of several fights. Again, we never did anything that wasn't completely kosher. Eventually I told Derek he needed to trust me and get over it, or we were going to have to break up. He said he would stop worrying, and for the most part things were good. When Paul transferred out of state a few months later, things were really good. There were no worries at all and our relationship has been amazingly strong ever since. \n\nThis last weekend, my husband went out with a couple friends to some bars and a football game. When he came home, he was pretty wasted. We talked for a bit, and he mentioned how a friend of his had told him that he broke up with his girlfriend because she cheated on him. I commented on how that was a bummer and good for him for finding out before they got too serious. Derek, however, had a different take on it. He said it was a shame because they had seemed like a good couple and if they really loved each other his friend could move past the cheating, just like he had with me.\n\nAt first I thought my husband was admitting to cheating on me, and asked him what he meant. He told me he always knew that Paul and I had slept together \"at least once\" all those years ago, but he knew I was the one for him and forgave me. \n\nI told Derek that I had never so much as even hugged Paul (except maybe at his going away party), let alone slept with him. Derek sort of just patted me on the arm, said \"Of course\", and passed out. The next morning I asked him about the conversation and he said it was okay, he had forgiven me, it wasn't even an issue. I again stressed that I had never cheated on him with anybody and I needed him to believe me. He sort of did the same \"Of course you didn't, babe *wink*\" thing again and went to work.\n\nEvery time I've tried to talk to him since, he won't hear me out. I'm this close to losing it with him. I need him to know that I never cheated, and I'm hurt that he thinks I would do something like that. What do I do? Do I just let him have this since it's not really hurting anything, or what? I don't want my own husband to think so little of me that he thinks I would cheat. That's not who I am.\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: My husband is convinced that he forgave me for cheating near the beginning of our relationship. Problem is, I never cheated. I'm upset that he thinks so little of me and won't believe me when I say I didn't cheat.",

I am devastated that you believe I'm capable of that, and it makes me wonder how low your opinion of me is. Refusing to believe me when I tell you the truth is only hurting me more. 'Forgiving' me does not make it okay. I'm upset that you think of me as a cheater and a liar, and 'forgiving' me just reinforces that you think I've done something terrible.\n\nIf you can't trust my word on something this important, our relationship must be a lot worse than I thought it was. I thought that you knew me better. I thought you trusted me more. After this revelation I'm very hurt and worried about where we stand. I need you to go to couples counseling with me so we can resolve this.\"",

            "Honestly, this sounds like the kind of thing I would do; assume the worst, hold onto the assumption that the worst is reality and decide to be ok with the worst so as not to get hurt if it ever comes to light. It's stemmed from a deep rooted insecurity. (Unfortunately in my case it was actually true; it really sucks when your paranoia becomes validated. I can also say from experience that it doesn't do much to soften the blow when, as I said before, the worst comes to light.) \n\nSooo, as a mental exercise, it's not all that worthwhile. If you had actually said \"you're right, I did cheat,\" he wouldn't have responded as coolly; he'd be crushed just like anyone would.\n\nBottom line, he's upsetting you with his lack of trust. You may not be able to get him to eliminate this coping mechanism, but you should definitely communicate to him that \n\nA) It's upsetting you and\n\nB) it's obsolete anyway.  ",

            "Yikes.  \n\nSo he really thinks you cheated, but forgave you without actually talking to you about it?  That's really weird.  Is he using this as some kind of moral superiority thing?  Like \"look what an amazing person I am that I can forgive this\"? \n\nOr...I hate to say it, but is there any chance he cheated and is using this to justify himself somehow?  \n\nI think you should schedule some couple's therapy ASAP.  \n\nEdit: the timing of this is really weird.  Why would he bring it up now, years later?  ",
            "You need to first and foremost get to the bottom of *why* he thinks that you cheated on him when, as you say, your relationship with Paul was never inappropriate. \n\nThis will involve going over some of your memories for instances that could have been misconstrued, and it will also involve talking to Derek and getting to the bottom of this. \n\nOnce that's figured out, you need to stress the importance of trust in your relationship with Derek. This is odd, that he just accepted you cheated on him without ever mentioning it in the past. I can't think of a single person who would just let something like that go and carry on as normal. \n\nAnd then you need to find some way to make Derek see that you did not cheat on him. This has the power to ruin your relationship down the road. What if he starts developing an inappropriate relationship with a female coworker? Are you going to be allowed to tell him to stop or is he going to shove \"Paul\" in your face and use his forgiving you as justification for future misbehavior? That's just one potential issue that could arise from this. Also, what if he starts telling people that you cheated on him? That's not fair. There are many issues here. Don't just \"let him have this\" because it *will* become an issue.  \n\nThis is a very muddy situation. Don't waste time feeling insulted or angry with him. Spend your energy on figuring out how to solve this. Involving a professional could be helpful if a few conversations don't seem to improve the situation.\n\nGood luck, OP. ",

It made absolutely no sense at all, none of us on the trip were on social media (other than some pictures of us all as a group a few times), I never mentioned any of the guys (or girls) on the trip to him really, there was just.. no reason for him to think it. I was emailing him every few days. \n\nIt really hurt my feelings and made me feel like he didn't think highly of me. It wasn't until I blew up at him that he stopped and said he believed me. I really don't think he did believe me. But at least he shut up about it.\n\nDoes your husband have insecurity issues a lot?

            "Girl, I would bet my car that Derek is cheating on you right now. \n\nI have posted this on reddit several times before but there is a rule of thumb I have in life. That if someone stridently accuses you of something that you KNOW is not true of you, it's likely that it is actually true of that person.\n\nSo, in a workplace, if a co-worker started stridently accusing me of stealing when I never did anything remotely close to stealing, I would begin to suspect them of stealing.\n\nIf someone, out of nowhere, started accusing me of being a child abuser, I would start to suspect they were a child abuser.\n\nIf a mechanic suddenly started accusing me of using the wrong kind of motor oil, I would suspect they messed up and gave me the wrong kind of motor oil. \n\nIf someone started stridently insisting that I had cheated when I didn't, I would suspect them of cheating.\n\nThat's just how I think these things often go. ESPECIALLY with cheating. \n\nI actually had this happen to me once in \"reverse\" as well which gave an interesting view of how it works. When I was 18 and in college I had a so-called friend who sort of used me and bullied me. He used me to come out of the closet and tell TMI about his anal sex escapades, but then he would tell me how fat and ugly and embarrassing I was all the time. Anyhow one time he was drunk and admitted a kind of gross, but minor trait about himself - he said his belly button smelled bad. Well later on he was so embarrassed by that, he claimed that he had never said that and it was ME who had said it and everyone must be just confused! Cause I was so gross, ya know. He stridently insisted I had a stinky belly button when nothing of the sort was remotely true and it was actually true of HIM. \n\nAnd of course, in that example, the more subtle things this guy said were also part of the same phenomenon. For example he would tell me I was gross and embarrassing to be seen in public with, in fact at times he would straight up tell me, I won't be seen in public with you. However, I was not embarrassing at all, and I was a well-liked, friendly person with plenty of nice friends and members of the opposite sex who were interested in me. But I think he was feeling like he was gross and feeling a great deal of shame about himself (due to his sexual orientation in that time and place probably.)\n\nPeople, they love projection. ",

            "That kind of dismissal is the most infuriating, disrespectful thing! I think you should sit him down for a serious talk - better a talk than a letter because all the nonverbal cues should help him to see that you're telling the truth. Focus on and open with the way he's treating you now, how it makes you feel, and what it means for your marriage. Whether or not you cheated on him years ago isn't really the issue here. Personally I'd just state that as a fact once and try to avoid ending up in an argument about it. Aim to get him to talk about why he believes you cheated and what it's been like for him holding onto that all these years.\n \nI think I would start (preferably uninterrupted) with something like:\n\n\"We need to talk. It really hurts me that you just dismiss me when I tell you I didn't cheat on you. It is so condescending and so disrespectful to treat me like my word means nothing to you. I did not and would never cheat on you and I can't believe that you don't know me well enough to know that. We were going through a difficult time when Paul was around and I understand why you were jealous, but I can't believe that you just quietly decided that I cheated on you and never discussed it with me. I get that you've believed this for a long time and you don't want to talk about it, but I need to. I can't stand that you think that about me.\"",

I would highly suspect that he's the one who has actually fucked up somewhere along the line.",
            "Maybe it's naive but I want my partner to be the person who knows me better than anyone else, who knows what I believe in and will have my back regardless.\n\nFinding out my SO really thought these horrible things about me... it feels like a betrayal.  I'm not sure I could be with someone who doesn't trust me and looks at me like that.\n\n----------------------\n\nI wanted to add, something else that has been true in my experience is that cheaters have cheating on their minds.

Instead of actually being vulnerable and trusting his partner, he chose to believe his partner was cheating and lying to him, and then forced himself to forgive it all. \n\nWhat you just found out is not \"not really hurting anything\".

IMO, it is *very very concerning* that he just brushes off your comments. He's basically dismissing you, over and over again, in an incredibly patronizing way. It's super weird and off-putting.\n\nEither way, you need to sit him down. Tell him, \"Let me talk. Do not interrupt me.\" (If you don't think he's capable of this, 1) reassess the quality of your husband's character, and 2) write it in an email/letter) \"What you are doing right now is incredibly hurtful and disastrous to our marriage. Your actions are on par with emotionally abusive tactics such as gaslighting. You cannot keep cutting me off, you cannot keep telling me that I'm lying when I'm not.

Either your husband really believes this and somehow got over cheating *without ever even confronting you to ask for the truth or your perspective*, or he's straight up gaslighting you and trying to manipulate you by refusing to believe you *even though he knows what you're saying is true*.

Would he feel justified in cheating because, after all, you did too ?",

            "My take - your husband isn't having a rational thought about this, his reaction is drawn from conflicting emotions he can't resolve on his own.  He needs your help but can't ask for it because he's so vulnerable.  Counseling won't help either because they will also try rational approaches.\n\nIf this is the case, you need to find a way to connect with and reinforce the portion of his emotions that will both restore his faith in your relationship and overwhelm the emotions that feed his doubts.  He's likely given you clues about what things to say and how to act but it may not be obvious that those are the things he needs in this immediate instance because revealing those would again show that he vulnerable.\n\nWhat will crush him is if you says he's being a fool and head straight to counseling.  That path will indicate to him that his emotional needs are trivial to you and will leave him both isolated and left to mire in the emotional swamp he now finds himself in.  That's not likely what you intend but that's how he'll receive it.\n\nA better approach would be to use a combination of simple calm refutation of the situation, a simple statement of your continuing commitment to the relationship, and whatever simple physical gesture the two of you have that indicates the physical side of your relationship is still alive - a short passionate kiss, a slightly sexual embrace, or maybe an extra wrap of one of your legs around his next time you give him a hug.",
            "Like the other Redditor says, counseling does seem to be in order here...   \n\nI somewhat wonder if because he thought you cheated, maybe he felt compelled to have an affair himself out of petty revenge, and perhaps his brain just can't possibly comprehend any other reality than you \"cheating\" on him first because of his actions afterwards would be completely unjustified..?  It's a stretch, but might explain his unwillingness to accept the truth...\n\n",
            "I actually agree with your husband about; \"He said it was a shame because they had seemed like a good couple and if they really loved each other his friend could move past the cheating\". I am almost certain my wife cheated on me but it was at a hard time in our lives. I was unemployed and she was the  sole wage earner and exposed to successful macho type men at work. In any event I didn't know what to  say or  do at the time so I let it slide. We had 4 kids at the time. Now we have been married 43 years.",
            "Denying it is sort of pointless and it's just going to hurt his feelings.  You are going to have an extremely hard time changing his mind, because that forces him to re-evaluate the entire narrative of his relationship with you.  It's not about YOU.  It's about how he sees HIMSELF.  He sees himself as a man who put his love for his partner above his jealousy because he knew it was the right long term decision.  If you convince him you didn't cheat, you're destroying this perception of himself and of your relationship that is clearly very important to him. ",

Think about the amount of mental gymnastics the might have went through before he made peace with the situation. Could use a bit of empathy.

Her guilt will eat away at her much less once her husband believes her. \n\nOkay OP, on a serious note, do NOT show your husband this thread.  Everything I wrote above in the 'plot twist'?  That may very well be his logic.  I repeat; showing him this thread will has just seem like you are trying to rally strangers to your side to prove your innocence.

Is he more charming or better looking or fit than your husband?  Was Paul flirty with you?  Did one of your mutual friends start a rumour?  There **has to** be an underlying issue for the reason of your husband's jealousy, and you seem to either omit it from your post, or you truly don't know.\n\nAdvice: Find out **WHY** your husband thinks you cheated.  The root of why he thinks that.  Don't get angry, sit down and ha e a real adult conversation with him.  Maybe it has nothing to do with *you*?  Maybe he's been cheated on in the past?  Maybe find out why he has trust issues in the first place.  Insecurities can run deep, and it might  it be your fault. \n\nIt sounds like you want to stay in this relationship.  Well, relationships are built on trust, and you two need to work on establishing 100% trust between each other, even though you aren't guilty of anything. \n\nI know everyone throws the therapy advice out there, but it really is helpful.  If he doesn't open up to you, maybe he'll open up to a third party. \n\nEdit:  Pronouns. ",
            "What no one here in considering is that while she may not have slept with Paul it seems like she had an intense relationship with him that was likely an emotional affair or acted like that to her husband.

Establish what you both know as a universal law(s).  If you're a fellow believer, the bible is perfect for that.  If you aren't, there is a overall moral code you can write out that can be just as useful in this situation.  (Note: scripture uses the law as a handmaiden to a relationship with Jesus, just like we use the law of the land so we can have a relationship with friends and family).\n2. Show that if you break one law, the whole law is pretty void.  (God has established a mechanism that this is true for all, for even the law of exception had an exception to it.)\n3.

Maybe with a counselor would be better. But in my opinion since your husband seems so determined to believe his story irregardless of what you say or how seriously you say it and given how frustrating and upsetting this must be for you I would seriously consider taking a polygraph or at the very least offering to take a polygraph.

I think the best way you can teach them a lesson is to make them earn however much it would be to pay for damages.  I might even demand that they cover a month's worth of expenses for the house (mortgage, groceries, bills, etc), so they can really feel how heavy home ownership is, and put a number to the costs of living.  If it takes them weeks or months to be able to pay that debt, all the better, because they can know that their sweat and time was wasted on the destructive party and they could have used all that money for something better.

Perhaps there is something creative they can do to memorialise the objects (like making broken ceramic into a beautiful mosaic), or they can create something new with its own sentiment that isn't the same but would still have value.  Or something they can do that shows honor to the person or memory that the object represented to you. Task them with coming up with ideas for an appropriate solution. \n\nAnd then there's the big thing - the breach of trust.

You should have left everything exactly as you found it, sent them to school, brought them home at the end of the day, then required them to clean the house to a level of excellence never before seen in your home. No food, only water, until done OR until bedtime, at which point you hand them each a peanut butter sandwich and send them to bed. It goes without saying that ALL electronic devices are confiscated for AT LEAST one month, and longer if they complain. \"But Mom, that's not fair!\" Make it five weeks for that one. Next complaint? Now it's six weeks. Etc. THEN STICK TO IT. And the cleaning continues the next day, with the same structure, until you are completely satisfied. \n\nYour children are spoiled and entitled. Do them the favour of fixing your parenting mistakes. ",

            "As a former teenage girl who threw a few parties and ALWAYS go caught, there is only one angle you need to play: tell them something of sentimental value was broken. stolen. damaged, or compromised. Even if it's a stretch from the truth, they might just start to realize that there are consequences that mom and dad cant clean up or pay to fix. \n\nA lot of people are saying your kids are irresponsible - of course they are, they're 17 and 18 years old! That is a very difficult time. You think you know what's right, and think you know who you are, but you don't. Today if unwanted people showed up at my house, I'd politely say that the evening was dying down and I had to be up early. But when you are a teenager, it's a lot easier to say yes than no. \n\nI think your kids are being honest with you. They tried to have a little fun and it got out of hand. Things like that happen. Hopefully they will learn from this and gain a little confidence to stand their ground. But that takes time. \n\nAgain, I think you should emphasize the emotional factor. Groundings, social media, allowance, and chores are all temporary. When I got caught having a party in high school, i got in trouble an wasn't allowed to hang out with certain people for a few months. But in the long run it didn't matter - I just ended up becoming friends with them again once the embargo was lifted.\n\nThe reason I never threw another party, was what they said to me. They sat me down and talked to me like an adult. They said they understood that I wanted to have fun, but that an innocent night could end badly. They told me that if an underage kid left our house drunk and got into an accident, my parents would be liable for any injuries, damage, or death caused of suffered by the kid who left our house. They said that they might not go to jail, but even the best people get sue-crazy when medical bills pile up. They said we could lose our house, our college funds, and have to visit a parent in jail on Christmas. Then she essentially said, \"Do you want to open your stocking while you talk to us through a glass window that you put in between us.\" \n\nThings may be different where you're from (Mum usually makes me think UK or Oz), but the lesson is the same. Let them know they're not wrong for wanting to have a little fun and things accidentally getting a little out of hand. Just make sure they leave the conversation knowing that even if it was an accident and they didn't want anything bad to happen and it was all innocent fun, bad things can still happen. Real consequences have no regard for peer pressure or na\u00efvet\u00e9. \n\nUnless your kids are sociopaths. In which case I'd just hide all the pets.",

Volunteer them for stuff.\n\nMake them so busy they don't have time for friends for a bit, but just isolation is probably not going to help them in any way.

So I recommend not looking at whatever action you take as a \"punishment\". Instead, think of how this changes your relationship. You can no longer trust them to respect your wishes or property. You also can't trust them to make good decisions. That is what you should be focusing on.\n\nDo they drive cars that you pay for? Not anymore. You can't trust them to take care of the vehicle. Is one going across the country for school? Maybe re-evaluate that. Are you a co signer on a credit card? You see where I'm going with this.\n\nObviously you are a parent and you don't want to ruin their lives. But they are adults and they violated your trust.

NOTHING. i don't care if that means colleges will turn up their noses - actions have consequences.\n\nd)  they pay for everything broken and missing (sentimental items notwithstanding).  if they don't work, then they either get to start, or their allowance (also gone, no question) goes toward it, and they'd be working around the house to work off the rest.  the one who works sacrifices her ENTIRE checks over to you.  after all, she doesn't need the money anymore, right?  and she needs to learn what it feels like to work for a living, buy things with the money you've earned, and have someone thoughtlessly destroy those things you've worked for.  btw, don't just vaguely say 'you have to work it off.'  sit down with your husband, calculate EXACTLY the value of the missing / broken items, the repairs to damage in the house, the relative value of the sentimental items, come up with a grand total, and divide accordingly.  each has to work off X amount.  cross it off as it accrues.  this will help them feel that their 'punishment' isn't arbitrary and indefinite, while also showing them a goal that they're working toward.  two lessons in one.\n\ne) i'd even consider - because i'm a bastard, and i believe this is a more valuable life lesson than just 'punishment' - asking them each what they're most prized possession is.  they'll know where you're going with that, so be smart about it (don't buy \"oh, this doll i had when i was 3 and haven't touched for ten years\"), but after that item was disclosed, i'd make them go retrieve it, and then i'd take them off to goodwill (or your equivalent - seems to me you aren't in the US) and make them personally donate it.  even if it's a $600 cell phone that you paid for.  they get to donate it, and then they get to, after this punishment is worked off, save their OWN money to replace it.  get it?  will teach them an item's value, and what it means to work to own it.\n\namidst all of this i'd be having some good long talks with them about respect, and what it means to work your ass off and go out of town for a well-deserved vacation (or worse, for some sort of personal family crisis) and come back to find your home and your things destroyed.  how would that make you feel, girls?  etc.  i'd also use this as opportunity to reinforce how despite reasonable intentions, things can quickly spiral out of control - after all, i doubt your daughters set out to throw a rager that would result in damage to your things and home, but that's what happens when you're a kid who invites other kids into your home.  they tell someone, and THEY tell someone, and before you know it, there's a houseful of people who don't give a shit about you or your home or what's going to happen to you when your parents get home.  (this is why when my son would proffer the \"you don't trust me\" horseshit, i'd counter with, \"i trust YOU.  who i DON'T trust is your friends, and their friends, and theirs.\"\n\nin summary, this shouldn't be just about simply \"punishing\" them, but also about TEACHING them.\n\n(btw, i've employed this technique with my son.  believe me, he well learned the lesson.  it broke our hearts while it was ongoing, and we felt like dicks, but he never fucked up in the same way again.)",

I've never trashed a house, but once when my cousins left a mess, their parents woke them up, handed them cleaning supplies and said \"start cleaning; we'll talk tomorrow.\" They had to clean, then go to school worried about what their punishment was going to be. ",
            "I have a similar story except it was my 18 yr old cousin who threw a \"small\" party in the fancy house she was HOUSE SITTING and trashed it. Didn't clean any of it up and the husbands super expensive corporate laptop was stolen from his home office (which was locked)??? A lot of holes but she is lucky the people who owned the house were family friends and didn't tell the cops about the underaged drinking. She apparently blacked out during the party and couldn't control the growth of people attending. Just fucking stupid. She had her graduation party cancelled, that's it as far as I'm aware.",

            "Taking things away from your kids is one form of punishment, but your daughters are nearly adults (one already is, in fact). They need to scrub that home and replace what's been lost as though it were their own.\n\nAlso, **talk to your neighbors** (assuming you have any nearby). Parties are loud. Warn your kids that if it happens again, the neighbors \"threatened to call the cops\" on them. Because let me tell you.. Nothing scared me from throwing parties more than knowing a neighbor might call the cops. This puts me at risk, as well as my friends (cops would patrol the neighborhood for DUI candy after calls)",
            "Yikes, sounds like things got way out of hand.  One thing to keep in mind is not only the outcome of the party, but also your daughters' intent.  In all likelihood they tried to hold a small get together rather than a huge party knowing that you didn't want a lot of people in the house.  However, somehow word got out that there was a house with some booze and no parents home and next thing they knew they had a rager on their hands.  Even if they tried to control the numbers, without being experienced party hosts it's practically impossible to keep people from coming in--every time you turn around to clean up a spill 3 more people walk in the door.  Looking back on my high school days it was also much more likely to happen when girls had parties compared to boys\n\nThat doesn't excuse things at all, but to me it would make a huge difference if my kids deliberately set out to destroy the house versus had a get together that got out of control.",

Heck, demand such a list from your daughters first and then verify it by checking their social media. Dole out additional punishments to your daughters if they are caught lying about the list.\n\nTell the parents what happened, including that items were broken, children were drunk, quite probably sex was had, and potential lawsuits may be forthcoming. \n\nThere's no need to say explicitly that their child did any of those things themselves - but they were part of it, complicit in it happening, and almost certainly lied to their parents about their plans. You also don't need to actually file a lawsuit (unless you can prove who broke what), but the threat alone will ensure that any kids whose parents actually care will be LIVID. \n\nYour daughters aren't going to be getting any congratulatory responses from their friends when most of them are called out by their enraged parents.",

A lot of people think revenge/retribution is the way to go, but there is a very important lesson here about who they choose to associate with.  If I had a party with my friends (years ago now) my friends were respectful and even if other people wanted to come, I vetoed people I could not trust.  If I was at a friends house, I helped clean up and made sure that the parents had no idea. The same went for my friends, too.  Maybe the girls could not do that, but I'm my experience teens who do not respect property become scummy adults.  I doubt your daughters did this intentionally; this is a prime example of why people need to be selective with who they associate with.  Even teens are smart enough to be conscientious.\n\nI would certainly make you daughters pick up and clean.  As far as sentimental items that cannot be replaced, try to explain the value to them by sharing the memory with them and make them understand that, while things are replaced, certain items cannot be and represent far more than monetary value.

The coach called her and told her she had to change the punishment and let them play.  Her response: \"Coach, it is your job to win football games, it is my job to raise decent human beings.\"  ",
            "Look, I'm going to give you the harsh reality of this situation even though you don't want to hear it. I'm not going to sit here like everyone else in this thread and tell you to evict your kids or make them live in a cold, wet shed for a month until the come groveling at the back door begging for food. \n\nIf you have high school aged kids and you leave them home alone for several days, they will throw a party. I did it, my friends did it, your daughters friends do it, every single day this exact scenario happens somewhere in America. Have you ever noticed how many movies revolve around this exact plot? \n\nYour daughters would have thrown that party no matter what precautions, warnings, or threats you made before leaving. You could have sat them down, strapped a remote-controlled grenade to their necks and programmed the detonator to explode if more than 3 people entered your home, and you would have come home to the same party mess and two dead daughters. \n\nIgnore the hyperbole if you want, but the point remains the same. There is nothing \"cooler\" than throwing a liquor-fueled party at your parents house when they're out of town. I can 100% guarantee that your daughters probably smoked some weed with their friends during the party too, and maybe they even dropped some mdma. This is what high school is all about, and you can deny it all you want, but unless your daughters are complete losers with zero friends and crippling social anxiety, they did exactly what any other red-blooded American kid would do. \n\nAll that said, you still have every right to be upset. You daughters threw a bad party. They should have taken precautions to limit the number of people who attended the party, and they should have had a clear plan of how to clean the house before you got home. When I used to throw parties at my parents' house, I would take pictures of  every room before the party started and use the pictures as reference material when cleaning to make sure everything was absolutely identical. That keeps my ass out of trouble, and it keeps my parents house looking nice and clean. It's a way to have fun and be respectful of property that's not my own. Your daughters should have had a plan for drunk kids who get sick. They should have stayed slightly more sober than everyone else and they should have kept tabs on everyone through the course of the night. Drunk kids at parties are predictable - they start slamming beers to help with the social lubrication, they start to get euphoric, then they get loud and obnoxious, then they start coming down - and that's when you drag their drunk ass outside to puke in the lawn. \n\nBut all of that is neither here nor there. Should you punish them? Sure. Take their allowance away obviously. You can get a job at 16, so allowances should have stopped at 16 anyways. You shouldn't garnish your eldest daughter's paycheck, that's nonsense. You can tell her that she either replaces what she broke, or she can move out. That's plain and simple, and it has nothing to do with the party. If she broke a nice picture frame stumbling to the bathroom in the middle of the night, you would expect her to replace it just the same. It's got nothing to do with the party, it's just common courtesy. \n\nYou can't take their phone away or block social media. Your daughters are adults. If you take their phone, they will get another phone. If they can't afford a phone, they will steal one. Nothing is more important to a young adult than their phone. Period. Oh, and I know your husband is a software engineer, but there is absolutely no way you can block social media that your daughters can't get around. 17 and 18 year old kids grew up with computers. Your husband is probably exceptionally good at his job, but just try googling \"how to unblock facebook\" and look at the 20 million results you get. If you block social media, your daughter will take it as a challenge. Take it from a 20-something SysAdmin, there is absolutely nothing you can implement to block websites that they can't get around in an hour. \\\n\nFeel free to disregard my comments, I know they aren't what you want to hear. I hope you treat this like a learning experience and impress upon them the dangers of what they did. They could have been arrested, hurt or sued when someone else got arrested or hurt. They need to fully understand what could have happened. Most importantly, they need to know that they can trust you and that they can call you if they throw another party in the future and you'll help them if someone is bleeding out on the floor. If they are too afraid of your reaction to call you, they might just let someone die, or they could die. You *should* be able to trust your daughters, but they **need** to be able to trust you.\n\n",
            "I had a house party once when I was about 16. It was absolutely crazy, about 50 drunken teenagers getting up to all sorts of mischief, someone tried to bury my Dad's trombone in the back garden, someone else made a shrine to a stuffed animal in the bathroom sink and set it on fire, at one point we thought we would have to call an ambulance because this kid stretched a condom over his face, couldn't get it off and couldn't breathe.

But my sister, best friend and I managed to clean everything up so the whole place was spotless by the time my parents got back. \n\nthey didn't have a clue, and we were so proud of ourselves! Two days later, my parents were throwing a dinner party for some of their friends. My mother used to make her own special homemade ice cream and keep it in containers in the freezer. So she pulled one out to serve at this dinner party, took it to the table and opened it in front of all her dinner guests. I was in my room reading when I heard her screech '*Fucknutlet!!!!*' I ran downstairs and entered the dining room. She stood at the head of the table, red-faced and glaring, all the guests were sat in silence, each with an expectant dessert bowl in front of them. They looked at me, I looked at them, at my fuming mother, and then down at the box of ice cream she'd just opened. There were about 20 tampons sticking out of it, when I got closer I saw that they had been arranged to form the crude shape of a cartoon penis. \n\nSo that's how my parents found out about the party. I was grounded for 2 months (but used to sneak out of my bedroom window anyway), had to make a new batch of ice cream and replace a box of tampons. I learned my lesson. ",

What can be replaced (and the cleaning expenses if any), gets put into a sum and divided between your daughters who have to pay back every cent at 5% interest.  For your younger daughter as she doesn't have a job you can give her some tasks at above market rates if you feel like it so she can convert work into effort.\n\nAlso your daughters can go out to their friends and find who did what damage and get some money from them.  That, or work the debt off.\n\nAs to the sentimental items it would really depend on exactly what it was.

            "Some of the advice on here seems to me like it may exacerbate the problem. I am going to refrain from comment as a result however when I was that age I can let you know that a friend of mine who used to throw house parties did so precisely because his father didn't treat him with any respect or trust him with much. For precisely this reason he betrayed the small level of trust given to him.\n\nFor your children to disrespect your wishes in such a significant way I personally would also be asking myself some fairly tough questions. It's all very well handing out a punishment, but in reality you need to understand why this happened. And I'm afraid that starts with you.",
            "[deleted]",
            "So you want to punish them for disobeying you.  This is a completely natural response, but please, before you proceed, ask yourself the following question: are you punishing them because you believe it will help them become responsible adults or are you punishing them so that you can feel vindicated?\n\nAs a parent kids will piss you off beyond what you thought was possible.  As a parent, it is your job to socialize them, to turn them into responsible adults, despite the emotions you experience.  That said, no matter what you do, it is perfectly fine to tell them how pissed off you are about the entire thing in no uncertain terms and even with harsh language.  No proceeding from there, if you truly believe that punishing them will help them in the long run, then by all means, go ahead.  \n\nBut please consider the following advice that has been examined by many psychologists and, from a practical point of view, is examined in \"How to talk so kids will listen, and listen so kids will talk\" (see the chapter on Alternatives to punishment).  For you implementing their ideas may go along the lines of telling them\n\n\"I am enraged that the two of you threw a party when your father and I entrusted the house to you.  It is beyond frustrating to come home to a trashed house and to be missing several items.  I expect you girls to be significantly more responsible than that and to be able to take care of the house when we are away.  As a start, to help unfuck yourselves, you can clean the entire house and replace *lost items* (if they don't have money, then give them some other way to make it up).  Now it is clear that your father and I simply telling you to not have a party did not work.  Once I calm down a bit we will all get together and brainstorm on a way for this not to happen again if your father and I have to leave again\" (see the book to learn how to brainstorm effectively).\n\nLater \"Your father and I are going out of town again.  Now you ladies have an option, I can either heir a responsible adult to look over the house when your father and I are gone so that way you won't be tempted let things out of control again, the two of you can come with us, or I can give you another chance\" (they will likely be dying to show you they can take care of things by themselves by this point; if they fuck up after this, hire someone or take them).\n\nThe general principles are \n\n1. Express strong disapproval without  attacking character (focus on the incident)\n\n2. State expectations (you have already done this before things happened)\n\n3. Give an opportunity for them to make amends so they can (begin) to restore their good name.\n\n4. Give a choice\n\n5. Take action \n\n6. Problem solve together\n\nThe idea behind the above actions is to let them feel the burden of their own actions internally.  If you simply punish them they will already feel like they \"did the time\" and won't have to process how their actions effected others.\n\nThese are the broad strokes, but I hope this gives you another potential avenue forward.  Good luck! ",
            "Make them repair and pay for ALL the damage.\n\nStart charging them rent. A few hundred a month. \n\nIf they refuse to pay:\n\nKick the older daughter out of the house. She is 18. She is on her own now. Give her two months to find a place.  ",
            "They're almost adults at this point you need to stop parenting and tell them to follow the rules or leave. 18 years old is legally old enough to live on your own. ",
            "Jeez, I'm amazed by how consistently harsh these responses are. Did none of you ever do things like this when you were younger?  \n\nGiven the info it's quite possible they ended up in a situation they didn't want to be in with a growing party and didn't know how to handle it. This is a very good learning opportunity and there should be punishment but some of you are way overboard.\n\nNo allowance and being grounded for as long as you feel are probably enough, maybe their phones depending on how important they are to them, as long as you have an important conversation with them about it. What went wrong, what also could have gone wrong, what they should be learning from this. It's important to point out the reasons why you didn't want this to happen so they see where you're coming from and why they should have listened. \nDon't be vindictive because you're angry but make sure they see why it was a mistake, and not just because mom and dad are going to punish them.",

My brother was 17 and threw a party while my parents were away...I was in college and got a call from a friend who said the cops were at my house. I called the police station, and long story short, I ended up having to drive an hour home to speak to the cops. My brother ended up having to do community service, and luckily my parents didn't get charged. We did have a family friend whose son threw a party, and underage kid left, drove home drunk and died in a car crash. There was ultimately some jail time and a lot of money lost in court. \n\nI think making them do something worthwhile, like community service, would be a good lesson as well. ",
            "You know how some parents like to bluster and blow and threaten their kids with excessively long periods of grounding and chores? Well, you should actually do that here. The kids don't get to go out and have fun for at least a month, and they get to spend their extra free time doing chores around the house or looking for jobs so they can buy replacements of the items that were lost/broken.",

            "OP, in addition to the punishments you may need to look at how you treat them. As many people have said I would make them get a job and take the allowance away. I understand throwing a party when your parents said not to. Actually I even understand it getting a bit out of control and not wanting to be a party pooper and therefore not doing anything about it. But the fact that they didn't even try to clean up and got so drunk they couldn't set an alarm to make sure there was as little evidence as possible astounds me. They have no respect for your house or the amount of work and love that goes into it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is coming from a kid who just graduated from a very large university this past May, threw a lot of our of control parties in shitty, overpriced college homes and still had enough respect to clean the place, repair any damage and get his damn security deposit back. Hell I became a master in repairing drywall. And that was a place I didn't even own, let alone a relative owned.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThey need to have some important life lessons and be taught the consequences to you and your family. Not just that you are pissed and disappointed. I don't know your children and I wouldnt go so far as to call them spoiled or brats, but it is quite clear they are lacking some understanding, appreciation, and responsibility.",
            "This happened to a friend of mine, we were 19 at the time, and her younger sister (16) threw a similar kind a house party. The house was RUINED. It was so bad that they had to move out and live in a hotel for I think around four months. He punishment was no phone (social media wasn't really a big deal because this was back in 2009.) She was grounded for at least a year, but it might have even been two. She wasn't allowed to go anywhere apart from work and school, and her dad would drive her to and from both work and school. Once their house was live-able, she was made to re-paint everything that needed to be repainted, she had extra chores to also make up for it, and she got no allowance whatsoever, for as long as she was grounded. And they also somewhat gave her the cold shoulder for a long time. They weren't mean to her, they still told her they loved her and whatever else, but they weren't cuddling up with her every night and allowing themselves to be sweet talked. I'm assuming you're still able to live in your house and the damage is lesser than what my friends family had, but I would definitely put in force a very lengthy ban on friends coming over, them going to see friends, and them being able to do fun things outside of the house. I'd take away their phones, but in this day and age, I would go and buy them each a brick phone that has no internet access, so if they do find themselves in trouble at school or work, then they can contact you. And definitely stop their allowances for however long you see fit, and make them do extra chores etc. And definitely do what you said about taking your eldest daughters wage to help pay for things. It'll double as a harsh reality that you have to pay for your mistakes, and also show to her that everything in life doesn't get handed to you. On the subject of the phones/social media, I would make them log into every social media thing that they have, and you and your husband change their passwords for everything, so they can't even check it on their friends phones at school. Also the password to their email accounts, because otherwise they'll be able to just request a new password. Don't let them get off lightly, because they'll do it again next time you go away... Although I doubt you will again after this. They need to be shown that they are still children, and they do still have to obey your rules.  ",
            "I believe the only way to combat their behaviour is to wait 5 years until they have a house of their own, and throw a party while they're away from home. Or, spank them and record it for all to see \n\n",
            "Oh boy does this bring back memories...I am the youngest of 4 girls (I'm 21 now) and when I was 12 and my second oldest sister was going through her crazed-teenager-drugged up-hate-the-world phase she threw a massive house party after we left the province for a family reunion she refused to join us on. (As a side note, we may have these reunions once every 5 years) My parents explicitly told her not to have people over. My dad gets a phone call one night from the police, letting him know that his 14 year old has thrown an absolutely huge party where there is considerable damage. He flies home early and comes home to barbecue strewn across the lawn, holes in the wall punched in with the fire extinguisher, broken glass from the washing machine, piles of clothes pissed on, my moms priceless bagpipes broken, dad's gold watch he inherited stolen..any electronics that were valuable stolen (including mine), peanut butter on the walls..just a fucking mess. The party apparently lasted 3 days. Oh and we had just sold our house and the new owners were to move in 2 weeks time. I'm impressed he didn't strangle her right then and there. She went to rehab and I can certainly say she is the most expensive daughter of the 4 of us.."

        "selftext": "I need help navigating this awkward situation.\n\nA coworker threw a party at his house over the weekend and I found out from other coworkers who were invited. \"Dan\" and I started working together earlier this year when he joined our department. We aren't on the same team but often will hang out at lunch or at the bar after hours with everyone else. We aren't super close, but we are pretty friendly, at least on the same level as others who were invited to the party.\n\nYesterday a coworker I am close with pulled me aside and told me she felt bad but she and others were invited to Dan's house over the weekend for a small party. It wasn't coworkers only and Dan and his wife's friends from outside of work were the majority. I was a bit hurt I wasn't invited and asked if she knew why and if I had done something to upset Dan. She told me that it was the general consensus that Dan's wife didn't like me hanging around him at work or happy hour and that I apparently give her \"homewrecker vibes\". She overheard the wife telling her friend this at the party in a different room from the main area and eavesdropped a bit. The wife said it was weird that I follow him on instagram and like all his posts when he doesn't follow me back. I was mortified by this, I follow other coworkers too and they follow me back so I guess I just assumed Dan had as well. Her friend apparently then asked if the wife was worried that I would see photos of the party to which his wife responded \"What? I can't have a party in my own house with my husband without inviting her? She doesn't spend enough time with him every lunch or happy hour? Maybe now she will get the hint and f\\*ck off. \"\n\nI don't have any feelings for Dan beyond work friendliness but now I feel like I've done something wrong and I'm being made out to be this office hussy. I unfollowed him from social media after my coworker told me this and got lunch with some other people yesterday. I still said hi and such when I saw him and we were both polite. He didn't mention the party and I didn't mention what I was told. I can't figure out what it was that ticked his wife off. We don't hang out one on one and it's always with other coworkers both male and female. I don't understand why I'm being singled out. I just want my work environment to be a friendly one and this sort of situation is causing me to feel stress and hypervigilant of my interactions at work now.\n\nIt seems like there's some undercurrent in our department now where people noticed I wasn't invited and are now making silent assumptions like they think I did something improper involving Dan. I walked into our snack lounge and three of the women who were there stopped talking abruptly and just gave me really forced greetings.\n\nWhat should I do to diffuse this situation? My natural instinct is to talk to Dan but I feel that this would get back to his wife and cause more drama. A close friend suggested I just disentangle myself from him completely and only interact with him on work-related things. I just want to avoid any more drama.\n\n**Edit:** Hey everyone, I want to say thank you for the huge response this got. I appreciate all the different kinds of input I've gotten, even if they were opposing views, it's good to get different perspectives because for all I know any one of them could be what his wife is thinking. I wanted to clarify some things:\n\n\\-My coworker who told me about it has been a good friend for the 3 years we've been at this company. I don't think she told me with the intent of making me feel bad or spreading gossip, just more of a heads up sort of thing. As far as I know, she hasn't told anyone else, but it doesn't mean other coworkers at the party didn't find out and talk to people.\n\n\\-A lot of people are asking if I'm attractive/more attractive than the wife. I think his wife is very pretty and have heard others say so as well. She is slender and has some very classic Audrey Hepburn features. I don't think I'm ugly, but I am a little heavier than she is and I personally don't think she would see me and feel threatened (but maybe that's my own self esteem talking).\n\n\\-Some have asked why I care about this. Several reasons, mostly that it will make social interactions more awkward and I will have to be much more aware of if I'm being too nice or friendly. I worry that as soon as the rumor mill starts of \"she must've done something for his wife to be jealous\" other people will look at me differently and judge my platonic interactions with my male coworkers accordingly. This could lead to a toxic work situation.\n\n\\-\n\n**TLDR:** Coworkers wife believes I am being inappropriate with her husband, my coworker. How do I diffuse the situation and keep my work environment from being stressful and full of drama?",

            "I used to be part of a nonprofit where I (single guy) worked with many people. One of my tasks was to handle the finances and reimburse people for things they bought for the nonprofit\u2019s activities. There was a married woman who frequently bought stuff and sometimes asked for a quick turnaround on the reimbursement because their finances were tight. I gave her husband ZERO reason to think there was anything funny going on, tried to be friendly when I saw him, etc\u2026 but if I ever came over to drop off a check (she\u2019d text me to say that they were home), he would always come to the door instead of her, even though the check was in her name, and always gave me the \u201cget lost\u201d vibe. \n\nIt used to make me pretty mad, because everyone else would just get their checks mailed, but I was doing them a favor. I eventually just stopped being that friendly to either of them so I wouldn\u2019t be accused of anything.

            "Sounds like a her problem. Keep your head down, socialize with others, keep doing you. The office gossips will soon find something else to talk about. If anyone asks what you did to her, just give em the Mariah - 'I don't know her \ud83d\ude42'.",
            "Take what your coworker said with a grain of salt, you are getting into a he said she said situation. Regardless, you can\u2019t control what your coworkers wife thinks about you nor should you give it any power over your thoughts and actions. Continue existing how you have been, eventually the wife will catch on that you\u2019re not interested or shift her focus to a new target. Chances are since you\u2019re young and assuming attractive, that the wife is projecting slightly. Maybe her husband has crossed lines the past, or maybe she\u2019s jealous/insecure/controlling/just a nightmare person. \n\nIf I was in your position I would steer clear of that coworker. Messy relationships are exhausting, you\u2019re single and have no reason to be apart of that shit show.

            "Know what? I wouldn't want to be friends with these people... but I generally have a rule, don't shit where you eat, and so I keep my work life and my outside life separate. You never know who is going to bring you drama and you don't want to have to deal with that all day long in a work environment. \n\nAlso, why was this coworker so comfortable telling all of you this? Inviting drama? You should ignore this whole thing and stay away from toxic people who talk behind the backs of others. Especially coworkers. They don't have anything better to do but hang out w others from work all the time? I always thought office workers who socialize so closely were weird. It often ends up relationships become toxic from so much time together.\n\nNow, sounds like she is projecting her insecurities with her relationship onto you and the fact that you are his friend. I wonder if they are having problems. I'd stay away from both of them until they sort this out. sometimes when this stuff happens I just think to myself, well not everyone's going to like everyone, so I don't let it bother me if someone is mean or disrespectful and dislikes me. I look at it is having a fan club because I don't spend any time thinking about them and if they spend any time thinking of boring old me, they are seriously wasting time.",
            "You act like nothing is nothing. For whatever reason his wife does not want you hanging around him. She is allowed to feel that way. You could just respect her wishes and stop going to lunch with the fella. Some people do not want their spouses having friends of the opposite sex. That is really an issue between them. \n\nThis could happen to anyone of either sex. Some people worry their spouses will cheat in the work place. So be polite but don't go out of your way to be friendly with him anymore. His poor wife must be really insecure. I am not surprised that she did not invite you to the party.",
            "I wouldn't do anything more than you have done. Nor would I assume it was overly about you. Yes, you liking all his instagram posts would strike me as weird too, but you unfollowed him. Beyond that, it could easily be about him or about his wife. Maybe he mentioned you to his wife too much when talking about hanging out with coworkers and she picked up on him having interest in you and projected problems with him onto you. Or maybe she is just insecure and controlling and you are her target. The fact that people in your office may be treating you worse due to gossip shows a failing in them. Or maybe you are so worried abut how people view you now that you saw forced greetings where there weren't any. Just go about your life as if you have done nothing wrong, continue to do nothing wrong, and either people will react to that and treat you well or there is something wrong with them.",
            "I\u2019m not sure how to help you but I have been the wife in this situation. For me it was a coworker that seemed \u201ctoo familiar\u201d, like she jumped in the conversation and said something about what he preferred to eat. It was weird. Really set alarms off. Maybe he talks about you too much at home. Just fade out of the situation. The office will find another drama next week. Don\u2019t sweat it!",

We aren't hearing the wife's side, so who knows what the real situation is.\n\n4. Maybe the husband told his wife something negative about you to make her not like and/or trust you. Men have a habit of starting drama between women, then acting all innocent when the grits hit the pan. \n\n5. Her house, her party, her rules. To assume you deserve an invitation is a bit arrogant.\n\n6. Why on earth would you bring this up to the husband? What good would come out of it? Just be cordial and focus on getting your work done.\n\n7. If this bothers you so much, you are focusing too much on other people and not your own life.",
            "He may have a past where he's paid too much attention to other women, and her concern about a new single woman who from her perspective is suddenly showing interest in him is valid in respect to their past - he may have been trying to make her jealous and talking about you incessantly - she may just have insecurity issues and is like this about every woman he has any interaction with.\n\nIt almost doesn't matter since you have no interaction with her and certainly can't change her or his behavior. You can only manage yourself. And no matter how innocent your intentions are, sometimes we have to look at the impact over the intentions. \n\nIt sounds like you looked for his insta and friended him, he did not friend you back. And since you friended him you have liked *every* post he's made. It's all a bit extra effort to do for a random co-worker you barely interact with beyond occasional socials. And that does look a bit weird from an outside perspective, if she's seen that it's not unreasonable that it caught her attention and raised her concerns.\n\nSocial media is such a habit for most of us that we don't always think about how things look to outsiders, and in general it's a good idea to not like every single post someone makes unless you have a close relationship with them. A lot of people do look at their likes, they pay attention who likes them and how much, especially on Insta.\n\nSo, maybe dial that back a bit and only friend co-workers who specifically ask to be connected with you via social media. Personally, I only friend co-workers I have a very close relationship with on my personal social media, I keep co-workers generally friended on LinkedIn to keep that friendly but professional boundary clear.",
            "Do nothing! Your coworker only told you all of that to stir the pot there is NO other reason. You aren't even friends with Dan.

If there are people at your job talking about you they will soon get bored when they realize you have no interest in participating in work place drama.",
            "One aspect of this I find interesting is that a question is begged:\n\nHow does she know about you at all?\n\nAnd the thing is it is clear she is monitoring his instagram and likely she hounded him for details about exactly how much time he spends with you. After all, she wouldn't know about you having lunch unless he told her.\n\nSo in my eyes you've walked into the middle of a mess. She is clearly overstepping and paranoid, but of course we don't know if Dan has given her reason to be worried so it is hard to say exactly what it represents.\n\nIf what your workmate said is true you don't want to get involved with him, if anything step back a bit. Because she is clearly hostile and that seems a very messy scenario to jump into head first for just some guy at your office.",

            "I think there's probably some mix of little things that led to his wife feeling this way, which could include:\n\n* The average 35 year old uses social media differently than the average 27 year old who grew up with it.  As a 35 year old, I don't have any of my coworkers on social media and I find it a little odd that you like every one of Dan's posts.  You probably see it differently, but I would say that you are heavily interacting with him on social media.  And if my partner was heavily interacting with a significantly-younger female coworker on social media, I would honestly take note and probably pay more attention to their other interactions.\n* You say that you didn't go to lunch with him yesterday as if that were unusual.  If you're socializing with him at lunch or happy hour almost *every* day, that's honestly a lot.  He may be spending more quality time with you than his wife, especially if happy hours are a regular thing.  You say others are always around, but do you find that it's *always* you and Dan that are the core group and then the \"others\" sometimes vary?  Is it usually you and Dan that start the plans and then others tag along?  A lot of people aren't okay with their SO having a \"work wife\" type person who is *always, always* there at every lunch and happy hour.\n* It also sounds like you and Dan specifically bonded over a couple mutual interests.  Do you find yourself often in a one-on-one conversation with him while others talk among themselves?  It could be rubbing salt in the wound that on top of the above things, you and Dan connected so well over something.\n* Dan probably talks about you at home in a way that makes it feel like there could be a little something there, or at least rubs it in that you spend all this time together bonding over mutual interests.\n* You're significantly younger than him, and to be very honest, it raises up a little red flag in my mind if I see that my partner is developing a close friendship with someone \\~8 years younger than him.  In my experience, most of the time, the man is into that \"friendship\" because there's some sort of attraction and not because of genuinely having a ton in common with someone so much younger.\n\nI say all this because while I don't think you did anything terribly wrong, I do think it would serve you well to be a little more intentional about the tone of your friendships with male coworkers.\n\nAs for what to do next, I think you should say nothing further about this to anyone and act normally, with the exception that you tone down your friendship with Dan.  Don't be the one to ask him to lunch or happy hour; don't interact with him on social media; don't find yourself having a one-on-one conversation with him in the middle of a group happy hour; etc.",

When she looks at you she sees exactly the kind of woman her husband is attracted to so she singled you out because you are threatening. Shame on Dan for not putting a stop to the gossip and rumors and for not checking his wife.",
            "Hanging out after work, Having office husband/wife, going out drinking\u2026 all of these situations are just no go\u2026 just don\u2019t shit where you it, if you like you job!",
            "Wife sounds really insecure and jealous. It doesn't sound like you did anything wrong other than being a young woman. I completely understand your fear that you will be caught ip in the office rumor mill.\n\n\nUnfollowing him on social media was wise since he didn't reciprocate and you are concerned about appearances. But I don't think you should try to have a conversation with him about what you did wrong, because it's not your fault that his wife is acting like this and talking shit about you around your coworkers. Keep it professional and courteous. If rumors start to swirl about you being inappropriate with him because of his wife's gossiping, then address it right away including with HR if you need to. There is nothing inherently inappropriate about having lunch or happy hour with coworkers. But it is very inappropriate to damage your husband's co-worker's reputation because you are a petty jealous gossip. If she continues then she is the one making trouble for her husband.",

I look at her and thought WTF  Found out later from on of the boys there mother gushed on on about me to my wife and their wives.\n\nRemember I haven't  seen but 3 times in 10 years and was never alone with her in the house, that my wife was not just about sitting on top of me every time me and cousin's ex-wife talked.\n\nWife felt she was threat. I was 64 my wife was 64 at time.  I haven't seen my wife that jealous in years.

            "I think you are handling Dan correctly by distancing yourself.  As for other people gossiping in the office, if it is possible, talk with the friend who gave you a heads up and see if she can help you quell the rumor - people often listen to a third party more than an involved party.  It sucks because you've done nothing wrong, which is why gossip is so harmful.",

I've seen things like this a work go well for these groups for a certain period of time until someone has a fall out, someone get's too drunk, someone flirts with so and so, someone brags about how they are liked the most. And then they are only left to stick it out or get a new job. For this reason, I don't really hang out with coworkers. I maybe will go to a whole office dinner where the boss invites everyone or have coffee one on one with someone once in a great blue moon to talk business matters, but nothing close.

I'm pretty sure the Bride didn't want me present because she was very insecure and systematically ignored women in the office that she suspected might be interested in the groom.  It just so happened to be my turn to be ignored when the invites went out. She started speaking to me again a few months later when I announced my own engagement. \n\nMy advice is to ignore Dan.

It sucks that you might not be able to keep a friend over his wife's feeling about you but that's his spouse. He should and needs to put her feelings before others' at the end of the day for the sake of his marriage. It sucks to lose a friend over it but what's more important to a person? Not to mention, if you push harder to mend things between you, you run the risk of looking like you're doing what she's accusing you of doing.

It has happened to me before as well and it really hurt, but the bottom line is that your workplace is a place to be professional and you aren't entitled to be invited to private functions at coworkers' homes. Be friendly. Be professional. Respect boundaries and keep up your own. If you don't want stress and drama, be mindful of the person who introduced it to your life - the eavesdropping coworker.

There's no need to interact with him or any other coworkers on social media, so maybe pull back from that - seems like a bad idea in general unless you're in a specific sort of job that requires it.  \n\nIf your coworker tries to talk to you about this again, tell her you don't want to hear personal gossip about yourself or anyone else, and change the subject.",

Seems like an odd hang-up to have about someone with no indication of why, and maybe your other coworkers picked up on that. Unfortunately, while it involves you, it's ultimately THEIR problem. Perhaps Dan made a passing comment about you, or you look like an ex of his, or his wife is extremely insecure and something about you sets off those insecurities. You can't control how other people feel, so it's not really worth your time to focus on that and try to \"fix\" something that ultimately isn't your fault. \n\nLong story short, I'd recommend you keep doing what you're doing and limit contact with Dan, and just move on.

            "> Several reasons, mostly that it will make social interactions more awkward and I will have to be much more aware of if I'm being too nice or friendly. \n\nActually you don\u2019t, just because someone is insecure about you doesn\u2019t mean you need to change who you are",
            "This same thing happened to me. I literally didn\u2019t do anything with my (25f) coworker (maybe 28m) outside of work (we did message each other every other day), I was just friendly (I\u2019m like that with literally everyone) and his girlfriend was saying negative stuff about me behind my back (I only talked with her when she came into the store to see her boyfriend) and claiming I was trying to get with him and stuff. I seriously never talked to her ever. She worked with my cousin (she was talking bad about me while she was at work) and my cousin put her in her place on my behalf. But I literally never hung out with him or anything like that. I\u2019m just a really friendly person. I should note that I had absolutely no intention of being with him in the slightest. That\u2019s happened to me at least three times (with different people) and I just don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m never flirty or anything! \n\nAll of this being said, I wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with him in the slightest besides work stuff. That\u2019s what I did and she totally backed off and I never heard of anything else with her after that. You guys are too old to be in such an overly dramatic situation. It\u2019s petty and immature and frankly just plain ridiculous. That\u2019s what I would do. I hope everything works out for you! I\u2019m sending you my love and support and good vibes!! Good luck! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

Dan\u2019s wife is so insecure and jealous that she wouldn\u2019t invite a coworker (you) to a party\n\n2. Dan is so spineless that he co-signed you being excluded\n\nMost of us learn in elementary school that you invite the whole class or nobody from the class.\n\nMy advice is to change your relationship with Dan from \u201cfriend from work\u201d to \u201ccoworker you don\u2019t associate with outside of work\u201d.",

So long as she\u2019s acting appropriately I don\u2019t care who she\u2019s friends with. If some guy crosses boundaries she\u2019ll put him in his place, so I\u2019m happy for her to make friends with anyone she wants to. \n\nClearly this wife is insecure, and it has nothing to do with you. If you\u2019ve done nothing inappropriate, and have your own life, this is about her and him. \n\nAnd what kind of fiend leaves you to twist in the wind with their wife shitting all over their friend? What is this 1958 where men and women can\u2019t just be platonic friends, he lets his wife crap on his friend who did nothing wrong? What kind of friend is he to you?\n\nI agree with others here, let it die out, never bring it up, and don\u2019t spend any time alone with him. He showed his true colors already.",

Unfortunately you can't help the way people feel towards you, and actually, especially in this situation, it ain't your problem. So as the saying goes, \"keep calm and carry on\".",
            "People like this are so gross. They're petty, jealous, and insecure, and the coworker who latched onto this and started spreading it around is just as bad. Your best bet is to ignore them all, avoid dan because clearly he's not capable of standing up to his wife, or maybe he was saying creepy things in relation to you that set his wife off. Whatever it is they're both bad news. Complain to HR about the rest of them if that's an option you want to pursue. That kind of behavior is unacceptable and allowing it to continue will enable it to get worse",

I am sorry if I ever said or did something to you that made you feel uncomfortable or your wife feel threatened, that was never my intention. Out of respect for your wife and your relationship, I think it would be best if our interactions from here on out are strictly business related.

The only thing you can do is back away from Dan, who has probably both talked about you to his wife and then thrown you under the bus on some level or other to save himself / his relationship.  Ignore all the gossipy bollocks at work too, that too shall pass.  Everyone seems to love drama at your workplace, so no doubt some new drama will grab their attention soon enough, especially if you don't add to the current waves by acting out.",

Her accusations are so unfounded, but if they had to come from *somewhere* then only she and Dan would know.\n\nDisengage from any friendship with Dan. Her boundary is pretty toxic, but he's following it in an unfair way to you. With everyone else, try to keep as you always have. If they're suggesting that anything inappropriate happened between you, set the record straight and see if your friend can vouch for you. That way, your job isn't compromised.",
