        "selftext": "Original:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3lgroe/my_28m_largechested_gf_of_2_years_28f_was_asked/\n\nA few things to address before I go into the actual update:\n\nI did not confront Jenna when she was going on her tirade because they were in Troy's bedroom. I have no reason to barge into someone else's bedroom to start a fight. You can stop with the pitchforks about how I was awful for not immediately wrestling Jenna to the floor in a show of manliness. Waiting for the event to pass was a much better way to handle this. \n\nHannah does not need you to tell her that she's wearing the wrong sized bra. She has been to ABraThatFits for fit checks, and she measures herself frequently and knows what works on her body. She has a wide range of sizes from when she was figuring out her fit size. If the measurements really don't make sense to you, I can't help you. All I can say is that she's a fat bottom girl.\n\nTo the actual update: \n\nI talked to Troy about Jenna's outburst. He said that he would handle it, and he was extremely apologetic and said that it would not happen again. He said he was glad Hannah didn't hear Jenna's tirade, and I agreed that it was for the best if we tried to handle this maturely. Hannah was still hurt from Jenna's comments on FB, but Troy asked Jenna to apologize, and that's what happened. We let Troy know that Jenna wouldn't be allowed over again if she continued to behave like that. He agreed and said he would be reconsidering their relationship.\n\nSome time passed, and here we are. Hannah has gone back to just being comfortable in her own home, taking her bra off when she gets home. She is respectful of Jenna and Troy's space and wears a bra if Jenna is over. But things changed the other night. \n\nHannah and I were cooking dinner when Jenna came over to wait for Troy. She hung out in the kitchen and talked to Hannah (they seemed to get along a little better at least, Hannah is very sweet and doesn't hold many grudges). I was chopping up brussels sprouts to roast while Hannah was making some herb and parm crusted chicken or something and some cucumber tomato salad that I love. She coated some huge chicken breasts that she'd pounded and that's when Jenna piped up and said something like, 'Wow, that's so much food. You're not going to eat all that, are you?' to Hannah. \n\nHannah laughed and said yeah, she was going to eat it all. It was her dinner. Jenna scoffed and made some comment like, \"That's so much food, I could NEVER eat that much. But well, look at me.\" She got up to try and get our attention and show off her figure. Hannah didn't say anything, but I could tell by the look on her face that she was starting to panic. Hannah has a long history with ED NOS and one of her only triggers is people paying attention to what she eats like that. She used to not be able to eat at restaurants because she was afraid of people judging her. \n\nJenna took it a step further and said something about how she goes to the gym every day because she loves keeping her figure and she knows Troy loves it. She pointedly asked Hannah when the last time she went to the gym was and then asked me if I thought Hannah should do some kind of Yoga or something. She made some comment about how sad it is when girls \"let themselves go\" after they get boyfriends. (For the record, Hannah didn't). I was starting to get very angry because it sounded like she was implying I do not love Hannah's figure or something. I put my hand on Hannah's shoulder and told her to go to our bedroom, I could finish up. She had the fakest smile and said goodnight to Jenna.\n\nI let Jenna have it. I dont' want to go into what I said because it was not my best moment, but I could not accept her trying to intimidate or make Hannah feel bad. I especially could not take her implying at all that I wasn't attracted to Hannah. It all felt too surreal. I've never met someone who would just say mean things about a girl who was perfectly nice to her like that. Especially not about her weight. \n\nJenna left and told me she was going to \"have a talk with Troy.\" I consoled Hannah, who said she was okay, but ended up not eating dinner. We watched some TV together and about two hours later, Troy comes in. He just stands in the doorway and looks at us and he looks right at Hannah and says \"I broke up with her. I'm so sorry. She is never coming back.\"\n\nJenna is gone and done. Troy later said that Jenna was convinced Hannah was trying to steal him and that she was just jealous of her body. It was all because of one day when Jenna came over and Hannah gushed over the dress she was wearing. Jenna thought that meant she was in love with her or something. I have no idea where this came from. \n\nIt was never about the bra I guess. \n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Jenna attacked Hannah after everything seemed settled. She's not coming back. ",

They reassured her that they would try to be cool. \n\nI visited last week. It was awkward and they were waiting for me to say something but I was feeling incredibly scared. I told them that I had a girlfriend. I was in love with her. we were about to move in together and I wanted them to meet her. They were quiet for a moment. I panicked and told them that I was attracted to men and women and that dating a woman didn't mean what I had with my husband was not real. \n\nThey told me that as long as I am happy and I was with someone nice. it didn't matter to them who I dated. They want to meet her. It feels like a huge burden has been lifted from my back. I am out to all the people that matter to me now. It is amazing. \n\nwe can only visit them next month as my girlfriend is incredibly busy with work. She is really excited to meet my family. I know they are too.

He flipped. He said that I was being selfish and inconsiderate by not letting him do anal. I kept thinking of all the kind words everyone left on the original post and didn't budge. This just made him angrier. He said there are plenty of prettier, sexier, and all around better girls that would be more than willing to give him what he wants. In fact, he had plans to meet up with a girl the next day. Admittedly, that stung, but I knew I couldn't give in. The responses to the previous post really opened my eyes. \n\nSo he stormed out in a fit of rage after I didn't give him what he wanted and I started gathering all his shit and putting it into garbage bags. I was running purely on fury at that point. I left his shit outside the door and locked it. I then sent him a text that only read \"In case there was any question, we're done.\"\n\nI don't think I've ever been that pissed in my life.

Getting turned down for sex when you are horny sucks, but a respectable person would respect their partner's wishes and just masturbate (unless their partner is against that, which to me, that's pretty fucked up but that's a different discussion for a different day).",

I'm sure you've learned a lot from this experience and you can find someone who respects you and your boundaries. \n\nYour ex will probably try to get you back, but don't give in.

            "Wow he says you are being selfish for not letting him do anal? Thats wack! Unless she is into it before even trying it and still enjoys it after trying it anal is one of those things you really need to let the better half decide they are ready to try and only then do you proceed, yes a suggestion that you like it here and there is not a big issue and if she wants your thoughts on the idea of it then talk freely about how much you'd like to try it.. But to pressure someone for it and then call them selfish for not doing it is so fucked, im glad you broke up with his disrespectful ass, and to use a line of there are other women prettier and better than you is just hurtful and douchie.

            "This is hard for you I know, but is really a great thing for your life.  Use this experience as strength to never let anyone guilt you into doing something that you don't want to.

Also don't let this jerk make you think all guys are like this.  Many will not be, and eventually you will find a good one who will respect you.\n\nI suspect even your ex may one day be ashamed of his actions, hopefully.

Just a warning though, don't let your guard down now. Even after we broke up, my ex continued to guilt me and manipulate me into sleeping with him (threatening suicide, etc) for years after we broke up. When I wouldn't answer his calls, he would show up at my house and beg me to get in his car and take a drive to 'talk to him', then drive me to his house and not let me leave until I gave him what he wanted. Please make sure this doesn't happen to you - regardless of how much guilt he tries to lay on you, you are not responsible for his happiness and well-being.

It is an amazing opportunity in a beautiful city with a reasonable cost of living. It is a job doing exactly what I want to do with a team I really liked and on which I feel my contributions would be heavily valued.\n\nThe BF and I have amicably ended our relationship. Unfortunately, I'm going to be stuck here for the next 3.5 months because I can't afford to move out there (2500 miles away) more than a few weeks before the job starts, even though all my classes this semester are online. I can't really go out to many local social events during that time, since I know I will see my now-ex, and it would feel like a dagger twisting through my heart to see him with a new girl. I still think I'm making the best decision for my career (and likely my future happiness); the next few months are just going to suck.\n\nTL;DR: I accepted the job offer like everyone told me to, even though it ended my 7-month relationship.",

You only have a short time there left, make the best of it! I swear when you look back on this time after you've been in a really long term relationship, those 7 months will not mean near as much as the 3.5 that you get to choose to make the best of.

        "selftext": "My GF and I have been together for about a year. Most everything is great except one thing: If I tell her I'm sick/not feeling well/hurt she refuses to believe me. If I have a cold, she tells me I'm faking it until it goes away and then says \"see, you are fine!\" I'm rarely sick, so it's never been a major issue. But, she has zero sympathy when I'm sick. \n\nShe grew up with hypochondriac parents who were always \"sick\" with something, often self-diagnosing themselves with fatal maladies. She has limited contact with them and the time I met them, I was told (by them) that \"they didn't have long left to live.\" I get it, growing up in that household must have been awful. But, what happened on Sunday just sent me over the edge. \n\nGF and my sister [29/F] wanted to check-out this event and we were all supposed to go. I woke up with excruciating back pain and could barely breathe. GF got so mad at me for \"ruining this\" that she wouldn't speak to me. As she was about to leave I asked her not to leave because I thought something was wrong. She said no and left. I threw up in my bed and eventually called my parents (I was too embarrassed to call 9-1-1) and my mother and brother hauled me to the hospital. \n\nI was whisked back and after ~20 minutes I was diagnosed with kidney stones. Fentanyl and gravol and I had a CT scan and then went for a procedure to bust the kidney stones. (Anyone questioning whether or not to have the procedure: DO IT. The side effects are nothing). \n\n5 hours later and I was laying on my parent's sofa in a haze. I have never, and hope to never, feel pain like that again in my life. I was sure I was going to die. The attending in the ER told me it's worse than child birth and that they've had it before, too. \n\nI didn't text my GF throughout because I really didn't have the strength or foresight. I was drugged up and uncomfortable. My sister found out that I had been in the emergency room and soon after my GF called me. She was pissed off I didn't call her. Then I reminded her that I begged her not to leave as I thought something was wrong. She got quiet and eked out an apology. I got furious and said something rather nasty things.. among them \"f-off\" and some other unsavory things. \n\nIn fairness, I was on dope, still sore, peeing blood and felt like someone had punched me in the gut. Standing was incredibly painful. I needed to take two days off of work & school, I rested in bed and the only thing you can think is \"the person who should have been there didn't even believe me.\" \n\nShe's texted me this week a formal apology and wants one in return for saying nasty things to her. I've been avoiding her texts/calls. I've felt like shit this week and picked something up in the ER so I laid low, took a few days off work and relaxed. She wants to meet tonight and talk about everything, but I'm still so mad I don't know if I should hold off seeing her. \n\nIs this as big a transgression as I feel like it is? Am I blowing this out of proportion because I felt so shitty? \n\nI just am so annoyed and angry. \n\ntl;dr GF didn't believe me something was wrong and I wound up in the ER with kidney stones and needed a procedure. She was mad that I didn't call her (I was too doped up) and then when I blew up at her she felt bad. I'm still mad at her. Am I blowing this out of proportion?",

            "If you want to work through this, meet up & hear her out. If she\u2019s focused on getting her apology from you instead of discussing what happened, then I would bail. (Note that I think you should apologize for the specific words you chose to express your anger. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong for being angry, but you could\u2019ve expressed it differently, without swearing at her etc.) If you get through that, I would be interested to hear how she plans to change her behavior moving forward. You had a medical emergency, & she basically left you to fend for yourself. Luckily, we live in the age of phones we can reach form our beds, & also luckily, you have other people you can depend on besides her. But I would want to know how she plans to change her behavior in the future when you\u2019re feeling unwell. \n\nI think it\u2019s possible that this was a wake up call for her that not everyone she encounters in this world will be like her parents & that she needs to work on those issues. But I also think it\u2019s possible that she\u2019s just trying to assuage her guilt here & will end up trying to shift blame back onto you for not doing enough to convince her this was a serious health problem.

            "When you pick a partner for life, the very least you should expect from that person is a ride to the hospital when you think you might be dying.",
            "If I asked my SO to stay with me because I had neck pain so bad that I couldn't breathe I would feel SO betrayed if they left. Your reaction is 100% justified. Her first reaction should have been concern for you. In a normal reaction, she should have asked if you wanted her to bring you to the hospital. I get that her past makes it difficult for her to be empathetic in situations like this but she needs individual therapy to figure that out. Imagine if she ever had kids and she didn't believe them when they felt ill... that would be considered neglect. ",
            "OP, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll see this but in my personal experience I\u2019ve had three times in my life I needed someone\u2019s support due to medical reasons. 2 were scheduled, 1 was not.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you how much incredible resentment I have for my husband that he wasn\u2019t there for me. I had my wisdom teeth taken out, I had 4 all at once and I was given hydrocodone. He was supposed to tell me to let the doctors office know if I threw up on it. I threw up a lot for about three days because it made me so nauseous. He laughed about it later like \u201coh hee hee I was supposed to tell you that.\u201d \n\nI had hives break out all over my body and my eyes were swollen. I didn\u2019t even call him to let him know because I\u2019d been begging him to address my needs for emotional support at that time and he just dismissed me. He was upset I didn\u2019t call him but quite frankly I didn\u2019t even think he\u2019d cared at all.\n\nI had bunion surgery (it involves cutting into the bone). His mom is a JustNo who had all these people helping her with the loss of a family friend... I partially understand it. But I had no one. I was at home, unable to move because it hurt so much and I was on powerful narcotics. Truthfully if I needed to I probably would have messed the bed because that\u2019s how much pain I was in. \n\nHe left me alone when I shouldn\u2019t have had to ask for him to stay. Thinking about it now, that\u2019s not something you should have to ask of your partner. \n\nOP, would you risk your life on your gf taking you seriously of your medical needs? Sure she needs counseling, but until she learns to stop dismissing your medical needs... she should do that on her own time and you shouldn\u2019t be her guinea pig until she figures that shit out.  \n\nAlso, you don\u2019t owe her a damned apology. She needs to grow the hell up.",

            "Personally, I would meet up with her and see if she is actually sincere or not. If she is honestly remorseful, maybe this situation has been a wake up call for her and shown her that not everyone is constantly afraid of illness like her parents. Maybe she's seen that sometimes people are actually sick and not overreacting to the extreme every time they complain. If she is sorry and feels bad, I think you should apologize for what you said. You admit you said some very nasty things, and, drugged or not, an apology from you for your words is also warranted.\n\nIf she is more focused on getting an apology and glossing over how she acted.....I would say dump her. Because she'll just keep up the mean behavior.\n\nRegardless, she should probably get some therapy for herself. I can't imagine growing up in a house where you're getting dragged to doctors constantly for very sniffle or perceived illness, and having your parents tell you they're dying all the time. Or being told you yourself are dying. Either situation would be terrifying for a child. I can imagine that would cause some serious psychological damage to a kid. ",

            "I just want to point out that her first reaction after finding out about everything is to be PISSED that you didn\u2019t call her. That\u2019s incredibly selfish and mean. I can understand her being angry that she didn\u2019t know, but she should have understand that you were busy dealing with it, AND her first priority should be concern for you and your feelings in the wake of this health crisis. Instead, her feelings and anger are her top priority.\n\n\nYou are still very young, time to find someone who cares for you. It does take most people growing up to become more considerate. I doubt your current gf is gonna get there soon though. You can do and deserve better than being with someone like that",
            "I\u2019d have to real hard time getting past this. And even if I did, I\u2019d be worried that I\u2019d have to deal with her nonsensical bullshit every time I got sick. Who wants to deal with guilting and doubt on top of feeling physically sick? For fuck sake it sounds like you have to be hospitalized for her to believe you? She can kick rocks. ",
            "Here's the thing, I married a huge over-exaggerator. He will yell \"formerwindow, come quick, there's blood everywhere!\" and I will sprint into the room and there will be two little drops of blood and I'll think *are you kidding me right now?* Everything he says you have to take with a grain of salt. If he says that one of the toddlers had a horrendous accident, they truly just fell, scraped a knee, and popped right back up. It's incredibly frustrating because not only am I the opposite, but I never know when it truly is an emergency. I tend to internalize and downplay everything, so by the time I end up getting help, I'm rushed in for surgery same day because \"it just hurts a bit\" is really \"I've ruptured something.\" We are just two very different people. \n\nHowever, never once have I not been there. I may internally roll my eyes a bit when I discover the \"huge emergency\" is something small and insignificant, but it's small and insignificant to me, not to him. I've driven 45 minutes to his work to pick him up because he had kidney stones (very tiny); conversely, I frequently get them, swear internally a lot, and just go to work. We just have different pain tolerances and ways of dealing with things. \n\nBut my point is this: no matter how minor his problem is, even if it's a paper cut, if he needed me to spend the day cuddling him on the couch afterwards, I would. I might tease him a little, but my job as a partner is to be there for him. I may not understand why everything is an 11 for him, but it is. And yes, it's frustrating. And yes, sometimes I'm not the best wife and I've asked him to stop overstating things as emergencies when they clearly aren't, but if he looks at a scrape on my daughter's wrist as the worst thing in the world, then for a moment, it's the worst thing in the world for me too. \n\nPeople here have had a lot of good advice about finding out what it is she is looking for, whether it's an apology or to give you one. But moreover, I want you to know that I was someone who grew up in a similar household to her. Hell, the night before I got married, my mother \"had a heart attack\" and had to be rushed to the ER. She wasn't having a heart attack. That's just my mom. But that didn't harden my heart towards my partner, just my mom. I'm cautious about her. Not my children. Whatever illness or fad or whatever my mother and her husband talk about goes in one ear and out the other for me, and to some degree, I suppose that happens with my husband as well, but I also take care of him. I encourage him to see his doctor. I get him medicine. I book appointments. I take care of him. I make homemade soups, I get special teas, I coddle him... because he's my partner and that's what he needs. And even if he is faking, what he needs is me. And maybe, with two toddlers and both of us working, I haven't been there for him as much as he's needed, so instead of blowing him off, I'm going to be there as much as I can be. \n\nSo, go if you want to. But don't feel you owe her anything. If you feel angry, then hold onto that, because you have every right to feel angry. When we are sick, we are vulnerable in a way that is terrifying, and she left you alone. You have every right to feel whatever you want to feel. If she is truly sorry, and you are both willing to work together, know that someone who is as cold as her is capable of caring for someone else. It just takes a lot of work and trust, and she has to be willing. ",
            "If you can't forgive her then you can't forgive her. There is nothing wrong with ditching a relationship because of a lack of empathy. It really doesn't matter why she has this problem - that's for her to deal with. What she has shown you quite clearly is that you cannot trust her to have your back with things get rough. ",
            "You aren't. For a relationship to be successful you have to take early behaviour as an indication of future behaviour.\n\nIn the past your girlfriend has shown you that she   doesn't believe you when you are sick. She may have learnt to roll her eyes and dismiss because of her parents but you aren't her parents.\n\nShe has taken every instance of illness you have had as evidence you are like them, and this has lead to dismissing and abandoning you when you had a serious medical emergency.\n\nEven if she's sorry now, she still has to change her behaviour for all those times she dismissed you instead if grabbing you a box of tissues and a blanket and a bit of sympathy.\n\nIf you want with time to continue this relationship then couple and individual counselling for girlfriend to address not every person is like her parents. ",
            "Don't think you're overreacting at all. Yes, she may have gone through some traumatic things with her parents. But it's not your job to be there while she learns how to trust, how to be emphatic, how to care for someone. \n\nAs others have mentioned, you could have died if it was something time sensitive. Imagine your family wasn't available and you had to go through this alone? Incredibly dangerous and stressful. ",
            "Normally I\u2019d try to be a voice of reason and forgiveness, but I don\u2019t think I could get past this. Her issues could have cost you your life. Imagine if it had been your appendix. Or any other emergency issue where her delay might have kept you from lifesaving treatment. You should talk to her, but she doesn\u2019t deserve an apology from you. You were doped up, going through incredible pain, and she still wasn\u2019t apologetic. The second she found out you had been hospitalized she should have run to you and apologized profusely for doubting you. ",
            "You're still recovering! No, don't meet her tonight! If your doctor doesn't want you to go to work, why would he/she want you to leave your sickbed to go have a stressful conversation with your girlfriend?\n\nShe'll just have to wait until you're ready to talk to her. \nShe doesn't deserve an apology. Her behavior was selfish and entitled. She would have put your well being in jeopardy if it had been something more serious.  Hypochondriac parents or no, she effectively showed you that you cannot depend on her.  You are not blowing this out of proportion, and you have a right to be angry. ",
            "Dude, seriously. She left you to basically die. ",
            "I had a kidney stone, and you're right, it feels like you've been stabbed and dying. And I can't imagine anyone, let alone a girlfriend who's supposed to care for you, leaving a gasping, doubled-over person in pain without offering some kind of assistance. While it's not immediately life-threatening, what would've happened if it was? ",
            "I\u2019d be pretty appalled that she still feels entitled to sneak in her expectation that you\u2019ll also apologize. \n\nI think you should meet her and let her apologize. I don\u2019t think you should make any big gesture or apology yourself. You said nasty stuff. How nasty? Like insulted her nasty or told her to f-off nasty? You were on painkillers after an intense experience, in which you hit your limits for both pain and fear. You\u2019re owed some slack. \n\nListen to the apology. I wouldn\u2019t offer one in return just yet. If she prompts for one I\u2019d take some more distance because she isn\u2019t getting it. She abandoned you. She did not believe you despite knowing you are not her parents. And it\u2019s shocking to me that she\u2019d pull the teenage-like \u201capology swap\u201d. ",
            "Ultimately you feel how you feel. No blame there. I have a question though, does her lack of empathy extend to everything or is it just illness? - Like if you lost a loved one or something really bad happens besides illness does she care then? If so, her parents really did a number on her and not caring about that would be un-empathetic as well. She should find someone to talk to. ",

The second time it happened to me, as soon as my husband came home from an eighteen hour double shift, God bless him, I said I needed to go to the ER. No questions asked. He grabbed his keys, turned right back around and helped me to the car. Your girlfriend got pissed because she had to miss her little event and left you alone. Nope.

Is this an absolute deal breaker? If yes, there's no need to talk is there?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf this is a \"I'm still so mad at you but I want to work this out\" then you should communicate that to her in a way which acknowledges that you used words you shouldn't but that the feeling that she left you when you genuinely needed her is something you are struggling with and need her help to acknowledge/accept that what she did and how she reacts to illness generally is unacceptable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're holding on to the anger to punish her, I'd think about letting it go because its not a very useful exercise. But it doesn't mean the anger isn't valid, I just feel like \"not talking to her\" is wasted energy. Either dump or talk",

This deep-seated childhood issue clearly still has a huge influence on her, and that's not going to change unless she addresses it with a professional.\n\nIf I were you, I'd talk to her and see how serious she is about changing this. If she's not serious or doesn't think it's a big deal, then I'd bounce. If she seems genuinely remorseful, admits she has an issue, and agrees to deal with it through therapy, then I'd consider giving her another shot.\n\nLet us know how the conversation with her goes!!",
            "Hahahaha -- she wants an apology. How cute.\n\nThat being said. A partner to me is there for you when you need them and it seems like she struggles with this. If you sincerely believe she won't change I wouldn't stay. Next time maybe you die and that's that.\n\nI wouldn't apologize at all. While I would realize I was wrong I wouldn't like her flipping it around on me like she gets an apology also like you're both equally wrong here. You're not equally wrong. She's massively wrong and you said some mean things because she let you down to basically the highest degree you can let someone else down.\n\nTo be honest. I don't think I'd be able to forgive her without holding it against her forever. I sure as fuck wouldn't trust her or make that mistake again and ultimately my resentment over this decision of hers would be our demise. I've learned as I've gotten older that some things just fuck things up for good and this for me would be one of them. You need to look deep inside yourself and find out if you can move past this or not because you'll just be wasting time you could've found someone with a heart.",

She was pissed off I didn't call her. \n\n>She's texted me this week a formal apology and wants one in return for saying nasty things to her.\n\nYou know, I get that your GF has some baggage from her parents. The thing is, while that would explain her initial not believing you (which is bad enough), she compounded that at every turn with even worse behavior.  First she's mad because she assumed you were faking. Then she's mad you didn't call her. *Then* when it becomes clear how much she fucked up, she demands a tit-for-tat apology from you, which to me comes across as a very bullshit way to deflect from how bad she messed up. That last bit especially is where I went, \"Nope.\" \n\nPersonally? I'd be done. But if you do want to try to come back from this, the ONLY way is if she takes full responsibility for being a jerk, and gets some serious therapy to address the baggage left over from her parents. If she can't take responsibility for making sure this NEVER happens again, your relationship really doesn't have a chance.  ",

She's shown her true colors and now is embarrassed that others have seen them too, that's probably the only reason you got an apology. I really think the universe shows us signs when we're with the wrong person and I think this was your sign OP. I hope you feel better! ",
            "That formal apology she texted you. If it was a true, heartfelt apology, it wouldn't contain a demand for a return apology. And neither would the next round of texting. In fact, an apology from you should be FAR from her mind. So, I'm not hopeful that going into this meeting she'll be in the right frame of mind. \n\nShe doesnt get to be angry with you for not forgiving her yet, either. You are not on her timeline. \n\nI do think you can make it work IF she realizes that her reaction stemmed either from her parents, or from just being a shitty person. If she's able to get to that point, she can change. I don't see this meeting making her see that truth, though. She wants an apology from you.\n\nIt's up to you to hold firm to your \"we need to fix this, and it never can happen again\" stance, and don't be drawn into any of the \"yeah, but...\" she'll throw. The response is \"we're not talking about how I reacted to YOUR BEHAVIOR while I was sick and drugged yet. Right now we're talking about what you did, and why you did it.\" And if she keeps on, then \"Ok, it's clear you're not ready to face this yet, and listening to you is just making me angrier/sadder. Let's try again after you have cooled down.\"\n\nYou might have to hold her at arm's length for a while, or simple walk away. ",

Everyone in the hospital? All faking it? \n\nYes, it's a big transgression and no, you didn't blow it out of proportion. I'd have a hard time forgiving that too. I've had a few recent health crises and the worst thing was the feeling of vulnerability and fright, so boy oh boy, did I need support from my DH.  I hated feeling that vulnerable and that scared.  You need someone at that time, and the natural expectation is that the person you love is there for you.  I couldn't imagine if my DH blew me off and left me to suffer alone. It would seem so heartless, cruel, and even hateful.\n\n Take your time getting better and only when you feel you can tolerate talking to her, let her have her say. But I wouldn't apologize for swearing at her. You were freaked out from just having suffered a bad medical situation after having been abandoned by her, and on drugs, so yeah, that's a natural reaction. You're human.",

Neither of those things are gonna happen if you stay in this relationship. \n\nThis was a revealing incident and I don\u2019t blame you one bit for being done. It\u2019s unfortunate that your girlfriend\u2019s childhood messed her up so badly, but she\u2019s an adult now and it\u2019s past time to acknowledge that her attitude towards illness is twisted and she needs to fix it if she ever wants a healthy relationship and/or children. ",
            "I have severe chronic pain and sometimes it\u2019s hard for my boyfriend to get exactly what I\u2019m going through, and there\u2019s even been times where he\u2019s asked \u201care you really in that much pain\u201d, but overall he\u2019s been supportive. It didn\u2019t happen overnight and I\u2019ve had to teach him a lot about my multitude of disorders, but he took the time to learn and when he says something in defence of pain in general, it makes me so proud.\n\nLike you, I woke up after my double mastectomy two weeks later screaming bloody murder. My boyfriend rushed me to the hospital and HE was the one who blurred out SHE MAY HAVE BLOOD CLOTS IN HER LUNGS because *I* was like you were after being on Fentanyl... (I was on dilaudid, Tramadol, Tylenol, and other anti inflammatories). He pretty much saved my life because my lung was fucking dying, and I would have been dead had I waited one more day to go in.\n\nHe refused to leave my side the entire time. I had to insist he go home to sleep because he had been with me 72 hours.\n\nThis is the type of person you deserve. Someone who BELIEVES you when you say you\u2019re in pain. I agree with baffled soap, hear her out. If she\u2019s not willing to listen, I would end it.\n\nOn the flip side, my bf was so sick he looked white as a sheet, he was throwing up and had severe abdominal pain. He was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with food poisoning. Well why did he keep throwing up and barely able to keep down any type of food? I kept telling him something else was wrong and as he did research, I was right there with him and honestly, I\u2019ve had to educate myself (and I correctly diagnosed myself with what has actually been wrong with me this ENTIRE TIME - 4 years) because doctors just didn\u2019t give me the answers I was looking for... so I knew what that was like.\n\nIt was my cousin who gave him his answer, and when he went to his doc they diagnosed him with exactly that.\n\nI hope you are getting rest and that you feel better soon. Again, you deserve someone who believes you when you say you\u2019re in pain.",
            "I had a very very tiny kidney stone in high school and it was just as you describe. Thankfully it passed but I was a complete wreck and have never experienced internal pain like that before or since. I get why she is the way she is - she's got an extremely low tolerance for medical issues. But that's her own baggage to deal with. The fact is, you were experiencing severe pain and begged her to stay with you and she instead scolded you for ruining her good time. To me, it's an alarming lack of empathy. Especially considering you don't get sick often. Caregiver fatigue is a real thing - but that's not what her deal is.\n\nYou'll really have to decide for yourself whether to stick with her or not. But consider, what will she be like if you get the flu this winter? Or if something really serious comes up in the future. Would she think you're faking it if, God forbid, you were diagnosed with cancer?",
            "Fuck her. Unless you called her something deeply personally insulting to hurt her feelings, she doesn't deserve any apology. She fucked up BIG TIME and is lucky you haven't left her already. ",
            "I disagree with the posters saying to give her a chance, and it goes beyond simply the massive problem of her completely abandoning you in your time of need. What I noticed as a common thread throughout your entire post is that whenever something wasn't *exactly* as she wanted it (you being sick, you not calling her, you using more extreme language towards her) her response is always to get angry with you! \n\nSo for me, there are two things at play here: 1) She left you in a time of immense need with zero sympathy, 2) You've basically expressed that whenever any negative happening to you is an inconvenience to her, she'll get mad at you. Do you want to live like that? With a partner that won't give you sympathy when you need it most? \n\nLate at work because of a big issue and you're tired and grumpy? Too bad, she's pissed at you. Broke your leg and now you can't go on that big trip? It would probably be nice if someone would tell you it's okay, and try to make you feel better, right? Not your GF, she's pissed at you. Car broke down and you had to walk 10 miles home and also have to pay to get it fixed? She's pissed because you've delayed saving goals.\n\nYou see the vein I'm going on. Basically, if you can get over this maaaassssive betrayal, can you still live an entire life with a partner who will make every misfortune about them? Can you experience the double hit of negative occurances + these negative occurances incurring your partners' wrath?\n\nFucking run my guy, and find someone who supports you. ",
            "Something similar, although not health-related happened to me with a gf in college... I forgave her, but we broke up soon after.  Something inside me soured toward her and I just.. well.. didn't like her anymore.  I tried to fake it for a month thinking it would pass... But I just didn't like her after this event.\n\nIf your initial anger has settled... when you think about her, how do you feel?",
            "I don't think you can forgive this and it's clearly an annoying pattern. I wouldn't be able to do this either. My ex grew up in a household where his mother was (years later) diagnosed with full blown Munchausen's and Munchausen's by proxy. As a result whenever I was ill or had hurt myself, he had to pretend he had something ten times worse to 'compete'. Drove me mad. \n\nAlso I'm glad you're over the worst of the kidney stones because I know how excruciating they are!",
            "This is a serious issue, yes. I'd actually encourage you to hear her out and see if she is really apologetic or not. It sounds like she knows she screwed up and is sorry. That doesn't mean you have to forgive her, but it's the first necessary condition. The next step would be her showing some signs of working to change.  But, if you're not ready to hear her, it's ok to tell her \"I'm so upset about this that I don't think I'm ready to hear you out.\"\n\nIt maybe this messed up your trust in her. You could get that back with work from both of you, so that means it's up to your commitment to and investment in her and the relationship. Is it enough to make working through this worth while?",
            "Her apology was conditional, so probably not very sincere. I would expect this to happen again. What if you were having a heart attack or some other potentially fatal problem? \"Oh you're faking it\" and walking out is such a horrendous response. ",
            "If my boyfriend was on the couch in pain and thought he was going to die, I cannot possibly fathom leaving him in a huff. It's not even like you're sick a lot where she would think you were also faking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, this would be a dealbreaker for me and I would hope she would learn from it.",
            "Honestly under the circumstances she should be groveling at your feet, not asking you for an apology. Meet up with her and see how she acts. Remind her how selfish she was to leave you, accuse you of lying, and then to blame YOU for not calling her. Only stay if she agrees to get therapy and make serious amends.\n\nIDK I would dump her, she's a terrible girlfriend.",
            "There are plenty of people out there who would give you a ride to a hospital in this situation. Strangers, even. Why stick with someone who treated you like that?",
            ">Is this as big a transgression as I feel like it is?\n\nNo, I don't think it is. You're in agony, and she made it about her, saying you're \"ruining\" her night out. She went anyway, leaving you writhing in pain. (I've had a kidney stone, stuck for a week. I know exactly the pain you felt, and it's no joke.)\n\nWhen she found out you went to the ER, she again made it about her, mad that you didn't call her.\n\nNow she apologizes, but at the same time, wants you to apologize to her for your reaction to all this? No way.\n\n&#x200B;",
            "Holy crap.\n\nThe only thing you should be apologizing for is swearing at her. To echo what everybody else is saying, whether you dump her or not will totally depend on how she apologizes to you. \n\nYou definitely need to stress with her that you totally understand where she is coming from with her parents, but she HAS to trust you. You won't try to trick her, or try to get pity from her, if you confide in her about injuries or illness, she needs to trust you in the same way you'd trust her. It's not going to be something she can change over night, but hopefully this is a major wake-up call for her and something you two can work through together.",
            "Heya. I\u2019ve dealt with similar partner issues, as well as issues of medical professionals disregarding me until it was too late and causing me more suffering. \n\nThis can legit give you ptsd, to varying degrees. That could be contributing to how hard it is for you to let this go. \n\nWhen you\u2019re in that much pain, just that experience alone where your body is basically screaming \u201cSOMETHING IS WRONG SOMETHING IS BAD I MIGHT BE DYING\u201d is enough to contribute to some lasting trauma or even ptsd.\n\nWhen you factor in how wholly dismissed and disregarded you were, and how when you were going through a traumatic experience it was the person who should have been there for you who did it...yeah, that can definitely leave a pretty intense impact. \n\nFor me, being in agony and having an SO and doctors treat me like I was drug seeking until I blacked out from pain made me feel: \n- crazy because no one believed me\n- guilty for whatever I was doing to make them think I was faking it \n- trapped and panicked because I couldn\u2019t fix this and I needed help and the people who were supposed to help me would not\n- trapped and panicked because I did what I was supposed to do and went where you\u2019re told your whole life you\u2019re supposed to go for things like this, and then it didn\u2019t help and they hurt me more and I didn\u2019t know what else to do\n\nI\u2019m sure if you were raised in a more normal family than hers, you grew up knowing that if you were sick and needed help, your family and loved ones had your back. Even if you got in trouble for faking sick to get out of school on occasion, you could firmly trust that when shit got real, they\u2019d be there for you.\n\nYour girlfriend was not. \n\nAnd in moments where your mind is operating in heavy pain and stress, having that lifelong firmly-held feeling of security shattered can fuck you up. \n\nI\u2019m sure consciously or subconsciously, when she\u2019s disregarded your ailments in the past you were annoyed but still felt like if things were REALLY bad and you REALLY needed her, she\u2019d come through. It\u2019s one thing to disbelieve someone or think they\u2019re exaggerating a headache or a cold, but when something severe happens it\u2019s very obvious and you trusted her to be able to use her judgement and see that. \n\nShe didn\u2019t. \n\nSo, not only did you:\n- Have a traumatic and painful physical experience\n- You had a core belief in security damaged\n- You had the hope and benefit of the doubt you\u2019d given her broken\n\nThat is super hard to deal with at all, let alone come back from/repair relationship wise. \n\nYou are not overreacting or holding a grudge because you\u2019re selfish or being passive aggressive. You are probably still processing how some of your core subconscious beliefs of security have been proven to be untrue.\n\nYou need to convey to her that this wasn\u2019t that she just didn\u2019t bring you chicken soup and dote on you when you had a cold. \n\nShe showed you that if you stay with her, you can\u2019t have that security. That the excuses you\u2019ve made for her behavior, and the trust and belief you still had for her to be there when the chips were down were for nothing, and are gone now.\n\nShe needs therapy, and if you guys continue dating I\u2019d honestly suggest a therapist for you as well to deal with getting past this level of betrayal of such a basic fundamental trust.

            "So you didn't do anything wrong and you don't owe her any apology. If I was in your shoes I would absolutely refuse to apologize for this. This is entirely her fault and you saying nasty things while you were hopped on extreme medication doesn't mean anything. Even if she was the perfect GF and you said nasty things to her while you were beyond high shouldn't require an apology. You had Fentanyl in your system, literally the worlds most potent drug because of a medical emergency.\n\nJust saying if I was in the same situation as you and my wife visited me in the hospital while I was still high and I called her A,B,C. She would be definitely not get upset about it, probably laugh at what I was saying, and maybe record it to laugh at me later in good fun. And definitely not post this nonsense on social media.\n\nNow..... I mean if you really like this girl and this is honestly the first real problem you encountered. And given her history then it's easily forgivable, but I would refuse to apologize.\n\nUsually things are pretty grey and both people are somewhat responsible, but like this is clearly her fault.\n\n&#x200B;",
            "So my dad is a bi polar narcissist with rage issues and would would often fake sick for attention when I was growing up. It got to the point where my mother never believed him anymore when he said he didn't feel good, but because of the trauma of it she never believed it when my sisters and I said we didn't feel good. As a result, we suffered a lot of medical neglect and \"suck it up\" mentality.  I suffered from ovarian cysts as a teenager and never once went to the doctor for it because my mom thought I was being dramatic and trying to ditch school. I still to this day have issues going to the doctor myself and think I'm blowing things out of proportion. I waited three weeks to go see a doctor about my UTI once because I thought they would be mad I was wasting their time.\n\nAs an adult, I have medical issues that could have been avoided if my parents had just listened and taken me to a doctor when I was a minor. But because of my mom's issues I never went. You've experienced how bad her trauma is, what would happen if she was responsible for a child or pet and it got sick? She needs therapy to address these issues before she ends up killing someone through neglect.",

What if they're depressed?\n\nI get that her parents were hypochondriacs but at some point you need to take responsibility in changing your perspective and not let the past run your life. \n\nIf this was me I would thank her for the apology but explain nicely that I can't be with her.",
            "You are absolutely not blowing this out of proportion. \n\nIt was kidney stones this time, but what if there's a next time? Would you list your girlfriend as your emergency contact? Are you always going to call your parents when something bad happens? \n\nThis justifies a breakup, because she lacks empathy and will not do things to help keep you safe and healthy. This could have caused some even worse health issues for you and she didn\u2019t even take you to the doctor. Is this someone that you want to rely on when you\u2019re sick? When you need immediate medical attention? I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for in a relationship and partnership, but I have an expectation that my partner will help me out, be empathetic, go get meds, etc., when I\u2019m sick or injured. \n\nI went through something similar once where my girlfriend at the time was less than empathetic and very selfish regarding a major injury I had. It was a symptom of other issues we were having. We are no longer together.

            "Even though I didn't have the same issues as her, mine were similiar.  \nBut instead of having parents that claimed sickness even though it was a lie, my parents treated me exactly like your girlfriend did.    \n\nSo at the beginning, when my boyfriend was supposed to visit me but got sick, the first thing I thought was \"that's not true. He just doesn't want to.\"     \nBut actually saying it? Oh my god, never.    \nEven though I thought it, even though I was angry, I KNEW saying it would be the WORST thing to do, because, what if he isn't lying?  \nSo I pretented it was real.    \nI told him to get better, I gave him advice on how to get better and left it at that.    \n\nAfter a while I stopped thinking this way. I realized how stupid it was. \nHe never even found out I ever felt that way.     \n\nSo I guess what I'm trying to say here is, this has little to do with what she went through and has more to do with how much she cares about you.   \nI agree with most advice that was given here, let her talk.   \nBut keep in mind, that if you feel like she doesn't give two shits about your wellbeing, dump her.   \n\n\n",
            "Is your girlfriend my boyfriend?! I have so been where you are my friend. And it is a shitty place to be! It is like taking fucking crazy pills. If your girlfriend is indeed like my boyfriend, the explanation for her behavior is fairly simple...\n\nShe is self-centered.\n\nThis is not necessarily a moral flaw. This is a strategy she developed in order to look after herself when both her parents remain preoccupied with themselves. They were not there for her. And, in turn, she is not there for anybody else.\n\nIt's a tough problem to address in a relationship. If her self-centeredness is truly confined to illness and injury, it might be one that is solvable. I think you're more than justified to dump her for this; it will be a long hard road for her to become somebody who is reliable and can be there for you. Here's what I did with my partner, to more or less successful effect: I would sit her down and explain to her that her abandonment of you when you need her hurts you and is not tolerable. It will end your relationship if it is not changed. But you can tell her you are willing to work with her to change it. If she says yes, I want to change and be a better partner, than you can move forward.\n\nAsk her to reflect on how she felt when her parents used their imagined illnesses to center attention on themselves. She probably felt hurt, abandoned, afraid and enraged. She probably felt bitter and betrayed. Now connect those feelings to how you feel when she centers the attention away from your needs and onto hers, even when it put your life in jeopardy. It is the SAME THING, even though to her she probably feels that you are trying to take attention from her that she desperately needs. But she doesn't. You are not her parents. Your job is not to put her first no matter what; your job is to be a partner, who cares for her as much as she cares for you. Remind her that helping you when you are sick takes only minutes or maybe a day or two. She will survive putting you first for a short time. The rest of the time, you are there for her. And remind her again and again that if she is not able to choose to believe you and prioritize your needs, the relationship will end.\n\nGood luck!",

Many of us with terrible families of origin work very hard to ensure we are healthy partners and human beings, and to avoid hurting others due to our own issues.\n\nIssues like hers will manifest in other ways in your relationship too. It takes years of therapy to overcome a toxic childhood. So I don\u2019t think she\u2019s capable of change on anywhere near the schedule you would need if you\u2019re going to be able to trust her again, but that\u2019s up to you. Still, in your shoes, I wouldn\u2019t be able to see her the same way again no matter what kind of apology she can come up with. Damage done, you know?\n\nI\u2019m sorry. Her inability to be there for you was her fault, not yours. You deserved someone who believed you and took care of you. That\u2019s just part of what being a girlfriend entails.",
            "This one hits really close to home so it's hard for me not to feel like you're in the right for cussing her out.

People think she's faking because she knows how to \"pretend to be well\" since she'd be beaten as a kid if she showed any signs of vulnerability/illness.\n\nI get sick a lot too. My mom thinks I have the same problems she does, but not to the same degree. It really sucks that I can't carry my weight of obligations sometimes because of how often I get sick... It causes a strain on my marriage mostly because my husband can get swamped if I can't do what I need to do for that time.\n\nSorry I realize I just made that about me for two paragraphs... My point is, I couldn't imagine someone being so awful to you about being in such pain especially since you rarely ever feel ill. I don't think I could stick around for what she said even if she's willing to change. I honestly think breaking up with her could be the kick in the pants she needs to get help.\n\nAlso, you're still angry with her. It sounds like you're curious about what she has to say but not really wanting to hear what she has to say regardless. So why entertain it? \n\nI had to stop being friends with someone because I almost died on a plane with her and she called me a liar about it until the hospital said otherwise. That made her realize she needed help and she started going to therapy and 5 ish years later we are friends again. I don't regret my decisions at all because of that. I get to have her back and have her respect me and my boundaries and now I feel safer communicating with her than I ever did in the past.\n\nWhatever you do choose, don't let her try to justify what she did.

Built a lot of resentment. \n\nThe thing is, she has to be willing to get help for the invisible damage they\u2019ve done to her or she will continue to allow it to make her annoying to be around in some cases and even cruel. You also have to be open minded and willing to work through the kinks with her. \n\nIn this case, yes, she should have stayed with you. She responded irrationally to a situation that requires rational thought. Should it be a dealbreaker? I don\u2019t think so. Find it in your heart to forgive and try to move forward. She needs a little extra love and patience but also a firm kick in the direction of therapy.\n\nCrappy parents are unfortunate, but they don\u2019t have to dictate how we behave as adults.

Nobody ever got hurt or died. Until now. Like you said, her parents probably made her into a person she is and it's gonna take a lot of effort to change that. It's up to you if you decide to stick around to see if she does. But I really advise you to wait until you're calm to make any decisions. \n\nAlso, the thing I would be interested in is whether she'll make it all/mostly about you (which I think she should) or if she'll make the apology you owe her equally important.

            "Not related to your question, but speaking as someone who gets kidney stones, you should check in with a urologist to see what you can do to create a plan to prevent them.  Once you have had one, you are at a pretty decent risk of getting another.  I got several before I figured out a good preventative routine.   Once a week, I take a shot of the juice of 1 lime and an equal measure of apple cider vinegar.  It is not pleasant, but for the stones I get, the acid in the shot seems to keep them away (acidic substances can dissolve many types of calcium which is usually what the stones are made of.)",
            "You are asking two questions, if this is such a huge transgression as you feel it is, blowing this out of proportion.\n\nYes and no.\n\nWhat happened was on the level or worse than infidelity. Your feelings are not only valid, they are healthy reactions. \n\nIf you want to forgive her or not is up to you. But in such a serous matter there is no way forward if she is jot able to see the seriousness of what she did, and acts accordingly. \n\nThat would be more or leas the same as for someone who has slept with somebody else. To take total responsibility for her actions, and doing what is needed to mend what she has done. She needs to urn your trust, wait for the time that will take. She will need extensive therapy and a change in bed behavior.\n\nUnless she understands this it would be unwise to be with her. And if course, you might just cut the strings at once if that is what you want. The choice is yours. ",
            "I wouldn't say you're blowing it out of proportion. I mean, when you're in a relationship you want to feel cared for and disrespected, not disregarded completely like that. Ultimately it's just a question of whether you can get past it, how sincere she is and how much you want this relationship ",
            "I think this is a thing where right now she has too much baggage to be a good partner. Maybe if she works hard at unpacking her childhood with a therapist for a couple of years she can get past it? But for you, it sounds like it\u2019s a deal breaker. If you part ways and reconnect in a few years when she is a different person, then fine. But honestly why would you want to be with someone who gets mad at you for being in excruciating pain?

Something like,  \"I like you, but I'm seriously considering dumping you over this.\"\n\nThis will frame the conversation about how she treats you and her past/present actions.

The relationship issues are something that can be dealt with when you out of the hospital. \n\nChildhood traumas can be overcome with effort. But her behaviors just showed her self-centeredness and her lack of care and consideration towards you. She's not going to change because she doesn't want to. \n\nI would tell her to give you space until you have recovered. Then meet up with her after you are out of the hospital.

Your situation is definitely worse than mine was though, and I could totally see why you would want to leave her.",

So, in a way, it might simply have been impossible for you to not say nasty things to her. Thus, you should not held accountable for such.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for breaking up with her (dumping is not a good way to express ending a relationship imo), you should do it. A serious relationship involves being there for each other and unfortunately I think she won't change that behavior and thought patterns soon. She probably has traumas involving her parents and this is not something so easily fixable. She should see a therapist and all and it's not her fault. But so is not yours. You should not have to deal with her traumas and put up with this type of behavior while she has not fixed this in her, which she might not ever accomplish.",

If she is truly apologetic first and is low key about getting an apology from you about how you talk to her, maybe she can wake up from this. If she wants her apology first and tries to minimalize her mistake, I would leave her. Regardless, she needs to get therapy.   ",

How long would you have lain there until someone found you?\n\nBut, if the relationship was otherwise great, i might possibly give her a chance. But only IF it seemed like she really understood the gravity of her inaction, and of her responsibility for fixing her own childhood issues.\n\nI don't think that's the case here.\n\nHer first reaction wasn't a huge apology, followed by a commitment to getting treatment. She hasn't booked in with a therapist. She hasn't gone out and bought any books on the subject. She probably hasn't even googled it.\n\nShe mostly just wants YOU to apologize for the way you spoke to her. You know, at that time you were understandably furious at her for the way SHE'D treated YOU. That's not \"understands the gravity\", that's \"completely self-obsessed\".\n\nSo if you want to end it, I say \"good call\".",
            "Regardless of whether you want to forgive her, it is not sufficient for you to decide to forgive her based on receiving an apology. You also need to talk to her about your feelings about being dismissed when you are sick, you need to be explicit that in this case it led to her leaving you in pain, you need to tell her she needs to accept your own perception of your body and trust you when you tell her things, because you cannot be in a relationship where you are dismissed like this, and what happened to you is a wake-up call at least for you that even when shit hits the fan, your partner is not there for you.\n\nNo one should have to survive in a relationship where their concerns are dismissed like that. A lot of people are suggesting she get therapy so she can take your feelings seriously, and they're probably right that it's the most efficient way to do this, but first she needs to absolutely understand what you have told us thus far:\n\n* she has repeatedly dismissed you when you are not feeling well  \n* she dismissed you in this instance when you asked her for help and said you needed medical attention  \n* you could have died in a similar situation, especially if you hadn't been able to contact someone after that moment on your own  \n* she put you in a situation where you were concerned for your own safety and felt abandoned by her and that it is unacceptable for your partner to leave you feeling like that because they don't believe you when you say you are in excruciating pain.\n\nYou should not talk to her while you are mad. If she holds that over your head, you should leave her. You should organize your thoughts about this, make a list of what you need to be sure is conveyed to her, and have a conversation that _must_ end with you believing that she will work on making the relationship something you are safe in.",

She\u2019s not inherently fucked up or anything, but she needs to address this because it will come up again and again in all of her relationships. \n\nIf you want to work through this with her, that\u2019s what I would suggest. Encourage her to see someone for a while about the baggage from her parents and hopefully you can both move on. If you can\u2019t forgive her, that\u2019s fine too, but I think this or variations of it will just happen again unless she actually tackles her hang ups.  ",

Realize that her parents behavior was ingrained in her from an early age and did a lot of shit to her, that may not be easy for you to ever grasp fully. She probably didn\u2019t even know what normal was for a long time. She still might not. I know what it\u2019s like to not be understood by others who weren\u2019t rewired at a young age by their parents. I also know what it\u2019s like to not understand them because of it. \n\nGiven her history, she can go to therapy, or make a genuine effort to reconcile her past in interest of her future.

Then OP had to call his mother, or anyone who wasn't his GF as an option. She abandoned him when he needed it most. And then got upset when he didn't call her. I'm assuming because she got embarrassed being \"the last\" to know when in fact she was the first person to know that OP wasn't okay. \n\nI wouldn't grace her with my physical presence ever again. I wouldn't apologize for cussing either. People are asking \"what if\" questions and that's good moving forward but what about now? OP had kidney stones, something awful for sure, that often times can be given a period of time before seeking medical attention depending on the severity.

            "What makes me suspicious of her \"sincere apologies\" is that she demanded apologies from you too.

And most importantly, do you want to go through all this trouble in your relationship? ",
            "Yeah, I would be pissed as well. There are a lot of layers here, but my simple advice is that I wouldn't meet up with her yet given that you're still pretty angry and still recovering and not feeling well, but give yourself and her a timeframe for meeting up if you want to make an attempt to salvage the relationship.\n\nThe one thing I'll comment on is your GF's lack of empathy for your situation. Sure, her care-meter was calibrated to \"uncaring shithead\" by her hypochondriac parents, but I think after being mad at you for not calling while you're in the hospital, and her making her formal apology couched in requesting an apology from you, are possibly more egregious issues than her leaving you alone in the apartment. Look, I'm sure you said some nasty things that you do need to apolgize for if this relationship is to continue, but who does she think she is demanding that from you? Like, it's fine if she expresses how your words hurt her, but she's trying to keep score and is making a situation that 99% about her being an \"uncaring shithead\" into issues with you. To the extent that you can understand why her care-meter is broken, surely she can understand (now, after learning everything and processing it) that you were drugged up and in the middle of dealing with a health crisis and were still reeling from the way she treated you. Here's the thing, while I'm sure that you said things that were soley hurtful and weren't just an expression of how she made you feel, you being angry was 100% justified and real and points directly to this character flaw she has. I wouldn't blame you for breaking up with her and never speaking to her again. Like, that may be the motivation she needs to get herself into a therapist to work on becoming a more caring person and how to be a partner to a non-hypochondriac person. Like, your anger and what you said should have been a wake up call to her. You don't sound like an emotional or verbally abusive person, and this was way out of your character, and she ought to have thought for a minute \"Why on earth is my otherwise kind and nice BF so mad at me? Is there a chance I did something horrible to him?\". This is something a good partner would do in this situation, try to get to the bottom of it rather than focusing on the symptom. This is why I think the latter two things (her being mad you didn't call and demanding an apology) are telling, and that she wants to talk to you to not understand how you feel and work on repairing the relationship, but to rules lawyer about what you did to her and make you feel bad for yelling at her, all with the goal of her not having to question herself and not having to confront what she did to you. I would be very careful when meeting her. Maybe have your sister there or something if you can trust your sister to have your back.",
            "Here\u2019s what makes this a deal breaker for me. It\u2019s not just that she didn\u2019t believe you and left, it\u2019s that she was *angry* with you for being sick and only focused on herself and how she was put out by your illness. And then she was angry again because you didn\u2019t call her - again not taking into account how you were feeling and why you didn\u2019t call. \n\nIt seems like she has very little empathy, and I wouldn\u2019t want to tie myself to someone whose first and only concern was themselves ",

Regardless of her reasons or upbringing.\n\nI realize that she may have acted the way she did due to her encounters with her family, but it doesn't change the fact that she's using that as an excuse to project it on to you.\n\nIf she is sincerely sorry and wants to talk, I'd say give her that chance and hear what she has to say. But, her wanting and asking for the apology to be reciprocated makes me feel like at least some part of her still feels like you were wrong and she is being selfish. (Even though you were harsh in your response to her, I still think it was justified due to what you had gone through and her behavior during and after. Not to say there aren't other ways you could have responded to the situation, but I don't think you were malicious or had I'll-intent). \n\nAs others have said, if you feel like this is something the both of you can work on and move past, then therapy would be a good bet for the relationship to last.\n\nIf I were in your shoes though, I would seriously consider if it was worth it to stay with someone who can be so cold when you really need them.\n\nGood luck.

            "I have been in two very similar situations. I have cystinuria, which is an extremely rare genetic amino acid processing disorder that causes cysteine kidney stones. These stones cannot be blasted and have to be surgically removed if they don\u2019t pass naturally. Luckily, I\u2019ve always been able to pass them on my own and I am now on medication to prevent the formation of new stones. \n\nI had my first stone at 18 and my experience was very similar to yours. I woke up with excruciating pain in my back, unable to move or walk. I begged my dad to take me to the hospital because I thought I was dying. He refused, and when I threw up bile on my bed he claimed that I was just spitting out water. I finally convinced him to take me to patient first, where they diagnosed the stone but could not treat me. Throughout this I was screaming in pain and vomiting loudly. My dad told me to quiet down because I was grossing people out. By the time I got to the hospital I had passed the stone. I\u2019ve had a very hard time forgiving my father for this, and I still hold onto a bit of resentment, but ultimately our relationship has remained strong because my dad apologized for not believing me, he believed me without question the next time I had a stone, and never once asked for an apology for my screaming and cursing at him. He understands that my yelling and my behavior was completely warranted in that situation. \n\nYears laterI had another stone, again in the middle of the night. My boyfriend took me to the hospital and waited with me for hours, but after several hours in the waiting room  without  so much as a glance from the nurses I felt like the stone had passed and decided to go home and go to bed. A few hours later I realized my mistake when I woke up and started vomiting from pain. My boyfriend is an alcoholic and was struggling with his drinking at the time. As much as I begged and pleaded, he refused to take me back to the hospital. I ended up calling his mom to take me. It was a humiliating and painful experience that nearly ended our relationship, but it prompted my boyfriend to seek treatment for his alcohol problem. After several attempts my boyfriend finally is sober and in recovery, and he feels extreme remorse for what happened. With my most recent stone he took me to the hospital the moment I expressed that I wasn\u2019t feeling well, didn\u2019t bat an eye when I threw up in his car, and stood by my side the whole time. We are now stronger than ever and I know that I can rely on him when I need it. \n\nMy point is that even though these people approached this situation in the wrong way, they have since made up for their mistakes with their actions and by admitting that they were wrong. They never once asked for an apology from me and understood that my anger and hurt were the appropriate response in those situations. Your girlfriend, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t seem to feel this way. From what you\u2019ve written in your post, it seems to me that she feels like you are *both* at fault. This is victim blaming. You do not have to apologize for how you reacted when she treated you like shit on the bottom of her shoe. For those who have never had the pleasure of having a kidney stone before, it can be incredibly scary to feel that pain without knowing what it is and that it\u2019s not life-threatening. When I had my first stone I was mentally preparing myself to die that day. I thought that was it for me. I\u2019m sure you were feeling the same way- remember that feeling. Hold onto it. Do you want to be with someone who not only rolls her eyes at you when you truly believe your life and health are in danger, but then doubles down and insists that you owe *her* and apology for your reaction? I suggest that you cautiously listen to what she has to say. Unless she apologizes, agrees that you are completely blameless in this situation, and takes some big steps towards changing her behavior, then it\u2019s time to say goodbye. People can make up for a mistake like this, but only if they go about it with the right mindset. ",

            "As a chronic stone sufferer I just want to say I'm so sorry to welcome you to this horrible club. It's the most horrifying pain imaginable and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. ",
            "No. No, no, no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou could hypothetically move on from this, but your level of possible trust and comfort will never be the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband has had to take me to the ER a couple of times, that should be the ONE THING your partner has your back on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so sorry, OP. Hugs.",
            "I would ghost her and put her shit out on the porch. She doesnt even exist anymore.\n\nedit: shit not shut ",
            "Yeah break up with her \n\n",
            "Fuck that crap.   \n\n\nNow you got an 'apology', if you have a heart attack in the future you may not live to hear the next one because she will think you're pretending.   \n\n\nI'll drop this person immediately as she is a danger to you.   \n\n\n  \nIf you really love her and would want to make it work, she needs to see a therapist to sort out her upbringing. Like, now. ",
            "She bailed on you for a stupid event when you needed a trip to the ER and then has the balls to be angry because you justifiably got angry with her?  Dude, save yourself certain future headaches and hit the dump button on this one and find someone who's got your back, because she never will.",
            "Nah dude. Get out of there. If she can't believe you in a situation like that. She will always doing you. You can't have a relationship with someone that doesn't trust what you say ",
            "In the long run, being able to be  taken care  of by your spouse while you are sick is a major issue. We all go there in the end, unless we die suddenly.   Our bodies get frailer, more things go wrong.\n\nIt is also important in the raising of kids. Parents have to be sensitive to and responsive to their health issues.\n\nUp to you. I mean it is possibly something she could work through if she was willing to go to counselling with you and see that this is a her problem not a rest of world problem. But there will always be that uncertainty won't there? And you could use that time to find someone who doesn't have this extremely worrying issue.",
            "I had an ex who didn't \"believe\" in getting sick. \"It's all a state of mind!\" He'd say.\n\nOne morning I woke up feeling weird. Told him, \"Something doesn't feel right.\" He told me to toughen up and it'll go away.\n\nTwenty minutes later while driving down the street I have a seizure.\n\nI almost died. In the hospital do you know what he said to me? \"You really need to stop being so dramatic. You were fine when you left. Now I have to drive you around everywhere because your license got revoked!\"\n\nDated him for another six months and had two more seizures before I finally said \"Fuck this.\" Because every seizure basically reset the time before I could get my license reinstated (and it still hasn't been, it's been nearly a decade since).\n\nDon't be a chump. Don't enter into relationships with people who don't take you seriously.",
            "I have had 26 kidney stones. AND gave birth to my son without any pain meds. Kidney stones are worse, hands down. \n\nAlso.important to note-you can die from them. A stone can lodge in your ureter and block an entire kidney leading to sepsis. This happened to me, and with on six days of pain and fever went to the ER again. I was a day away from dying. \n\nYour girlfriend needs counseling to fix her lack of empathy and sympathy. She is broken. ",
            "Give us an update when you can please",
            "> Is this as big a transgression as I feel like it is?\n\nYes.\n\n> Am I blowing this out of proportion because I felt so shitty?\n\nNo. Fuck her and anybody who looks like her.\n\nYou could have been fucking dying or some shit, and she just walked out like no big deal. It showed a total lack of respect and a total lack of giving a flying fuck about you on any level.\n\nNow she wants you to apologize to her? Give me a fucking break.",
            "It's really up to you to decide if you can work through this. If you can't, I really can't blame you. The level of betrayal that comes with being in such bad pain you think you may be dying and begging your SO to stay to help you, only to have them abandon you in a huff--I think that would be an instant off switch for most people on the love and trust needed to sustain a relationship. ",
            "I\u2019ll just echo everyone else here in the comments and say you have every right to be upset with her. You asked for her help and she left you alone, even if it wasn\u2019t something so excruciatingly painful I would expect my partner to stay if I was so distressed that I didn\u2019t want to be left alone. She acted immaturely and it makes sense for you to reconsider the relationship.\n\nThat being said, she did apologize and try to make things right. It doesn\u2019t sound like she tried to blame you or make excuses, and I understand her wanting an apology for you saying hurtful things (even if your anger was warranted). If I were you, I\u2019d at least sit down and talk with her. If the rest of he relationship is great and healthy this may be something she can work on. Get a proper in person apology from her, maybe apologize for losing your temper (though stand your ground that you had every right to be angry with her, maybe just acknowledge that saying fuck you to your girlfriend isn\u2019t a productive way to communicate), and see what she can do to work through her issues. If she doesn\u2019t want to truly apologize, won\u2019t work on herself, or tries making the point of the discussion that you hurt her feelings, then you can feel confident that you did what you could to make it work and that it might be time to just walk away from a toxic person.\n\nOnly you know if you can forgive her for how she acted, but I think it\u2019s worth at least giving the relationship one more chance.",
            "She apologized twice for not believing you. Clearly she understands that her behavior was harmful to you and she acknowledges her role in it. If you feel like you\u2019d like to maintain a relationship with her, you can use this as a jumping off point to tell her that she needs to get some therapy to work through her shit, and she needs to trust your own assessment of your own health.  \n\nHowever, you don\u2019t have to date someone if you don\u2019t wAnt to, and you can break up with them for whatever reason you want to. ",
            "Jeeez, that's psychotic, break up with her and find someone who will actually care. That's absurd",
            "Certainly wait until you\u2019re fully medically recovered before making a decision. But I do not blame you if you don\u2019t speak to her until then. A year is a very short time for a relationship. Personally, I\u2019d probably end it; you\u2019re young and there are more compatible women out there. Curious what you  decide. ",
            "This is no way scientific, but I think people have no filter when they're doped after a procedure. You're pissed and your entitled to be. She needs to get over that. Now on to your bigger issue!",
            "Im angry for you. You're not blowing anything out of proportion. Fuck her. You deserve better.",
            "My husband grew up with a mom who had extreme OCD especially with throw up. She would hassle him anytime he was sick \"are you sick? Are you going to thow up? Please don't throw up, please don't thow up!\" He has such a fear of throwing up now that the other day when he thought he was coming down with something he had to pull over the car because he was shaking so bad. I have never in the 8 years we been together seen him even come close to a breakdown. But he was full on having a panic attack at just the idea of being sick. A guy who is generally very well together. But it is a real issue for him even after all these years. \n\nYour girlfriend probably had some legit PTSD from her parents and has strongly associated sickness with attention speaking. However, this should be her major wake up call that her parents messed her up. This is an issue she needs to deal with for very obvious reasons. What if she had kids and they got sick? Would she deny them health care because she thought they were faking it? \n\nYour hurt is totally justified and understandable. This is a pretty significant issue. Your loved one should be there for you through everything holding your hand, especially though the bad times. \n\nThat being said, this is her bad time as well. If you don't feel you can accept her for it, then ending things may be the right choice. But if you are going to love her you will have to accept that this is a big issue for her as well. She will need to learn the difference between a hypochondriac and a real emergency. For your own safety, and so that she can support you during those times. In return you will have to learn how to support her to overcome this PTSD. If you work together I think you will have a stronger relationship because of it. \n"
