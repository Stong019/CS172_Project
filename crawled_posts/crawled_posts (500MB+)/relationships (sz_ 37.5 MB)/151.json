First of all, I would like to say thank you for all the kind words and genuine advice, though it was all things I had heard before, it made a massive difference hearing it from strangers who don't even know me. All of that and my friends giving me some tough but much needed love, I finally got the courage to talk to my husband.  \n\nNot long after I posted my original post my husband called me to tell me he had ended up *LOSING* the job he abandoned me for. He doesn't have a good track record with work (Just in general has been seen as \"lazy\" ect.) so this wasn't shocking but was a *COMPLETE* slap in the face. Maybe I'm being harsh, but I felt let down *again*. As soon as he lost the job, he immediately started talking about how he was going to move in with me, I became sick to my stomach because *I DID NOT* want him here. I felt and still feel like a fall-back option. I wasn't his priority in the first place but now that he is down on his luck, it's just \"easier\" for him to move here and start over with my help. I told him to not look at jobs here right away and look where he is, and he somewhat agreed.\n\n After about a week of us not talking he messaged me out of nowhere telling me that he had found a job in my area that \"Was a great opportunity\", he used the same wording he had used with the job he had just lost. I was talking with a friend when he sent the message, she told me point blank 'Talk to him now, or he is going to show up on your doorstep and you are going to be stuck in this situation for another few years, and you promised yourself you would talk to him this week.\" She was 100% right, so I went and talked to him. \n\nI told him everything, how I felt, how I am feeling, how heartbroken I am, how his issues and his treatment of me have pushed me over the edge. He realized that a lot of what I said was things I had already brought up, he did own up to somethings, yet not everything. I had given him a million chances during the conversation to tell me the things I should improve on because I am well aware I am not blameless. I should have talked to him more etc. The only thing he could think of was the fact that I don't incite/participate in sex with him. I brought up my issues with sex and my insecurities, he said he understood but I don't think he understood how much it affected me (from my past trauma and other bad experiences), and how he never made me feel better. I then brought up how I hate how much porn he watches (side note: I don't hate porn, I just think excessive use can be bad), and how it gave him an unrealistic expectation of sex, he said, \"I feel like I have to watch it to get turned on to have sex with you\", that comment made my stomach drop, and my already low self-confidence deep dive even lower. Also, I knew this was a complete lie, as he NEVER initiated sex after watching porn- not once. I knew right then I was ***done***. How could I even consider repairing this when he feels like he needs to watch other people to get turned on enough to have sex with me?! Mind you, he would casually watch porn without jerking off or anything, this man always had porn open like a Spotify playlist. \n\nHe is trying *DESPERATELY* to keep me, messaging me constantly how much he loves me, making YouTube playlists of songs, sending me flowers etc. but it's all too little, too late in my eyes. He's also downplaying the situation to his closest friends and family, just chalking it up to me being upset with him. All of this just makes me more upset, anxious, on edge, and quite frankly mad.\n\n I already started filling out paperwork to file for divorce when I am 100% ready and will be asking him to stop texting me as much (particularly all the lovey dovey out of character stuff) and sending me things this week.  This whole thing has been a lot, but I am grateful for everyone who took the time to send me words of encouragement. I have realized, and am continuing to realize, my self-worth and I know I am worth so much more than a man who never tried in our whole 8 years of a relationship up until now. There's more I could get into, but I think I'll leave it here. Thank you all again for all your kind words and advice. Feel free to comment on the original post if you\u2019d like to say anything, or would like to give words of wisdom or advice.\n\nTL:DR: I finally talked to my husband about everything and will be leaving him soon. Thank you to everyone who commented on my last post!",

            "Jesus you should be so proud of yourself! It really is too little too late. He tried to put you down and keep putting you down, hoping you\u2019ll never leave him. Now that you did the lovey stuff is what he things will lure you back in. You did great!",
            "What your husband is doing is called love-bombing, don't fall for it.",
            "The only reason he said that lie is to knock your self-esteem down more. He probably thought (like most emotional abusers) if you believed no one else would want you, you would stay. \nPlease believe me that you are desirable and you will find someone who adores every curve and imaginary fault you see. \n\nI'm glad you've started on the paperwork to set yourself free. You can also ask he only contacts you through your soliciter and block him. You don't want to give him anymore opportunities to hurt you. \n\nGive yourself time to grieve to loss of who you thought he was, who you wanted him to be.  His failures are not yours (hugs) you got this \ud83d\ude0a",

Keep those friends who rallied you close through this process, and don\u2019t let him worm his way back into mooching off of you and abusing you. It might be scary at times, you might feel sad and like you want him back sometimes, but you can get through this out to the other, *far* better side.\n\nAlso, I just wanted to say - take a good amount of time, like at least a year or so IMO, to kind of detox from this relationship. Don\u2019t seek out a serious relationship or serious dates; prioritize spending time both by yourself and dating yourself, *and* with people who make you feel good about yourself, who you admire, like your friends. You will feel so much better for doing so, and your love for yourself will grow a thousand times over. \ud83d\udc9c Saying this especially as a fat woman who had an ex many years ago who was incredibly fatphobic and abusive!",

            "i have a friend who used to be plus sized. she lost a lot of weight, and now tells me that she can\u2019t believe the way she let people treat her because of her own insecurities and internalized self hatred. she internalized this idea that because she was a bigger woman, she should be happy with what she could get and can\u2019t complain because the guys she dated already had to \u201cput up\u201d with her being bigger. despite all the body positivity in recent years, there\u2019s still significant stigmas associated with being bigger and effects social media/society creeps into your psyche like no other. \n\ni only met her after she lost weight and it broke my heart to hear her talk about herself like that. weight or not, she\u2019s one of the most genuinely kind, caring, talented, hardworking, smart, and unique individuals i\u2019ve ever met. she\u2019s overcome so much in her life with humility and grace. she often tells me how she can\u2019t believe she let something like her weight make her forget that. i\u2019m not saying that that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here, but worth mentioning. \n\nalso, if you can afford it, you should look into getting a therapist. much love and stay strong, i know how hard it must be.",
            "Maybe I\u2019m naive but I have literally never heard of just casually watching porn like a twitch stream or a music playlist\u2026. Wtf",
            "I'm so happy to hear that you're realising your self-worth! Brighter future ahead.",
            "Congrats! Keep going and ignore him. The insults that he throws at you are saying everything about him and nothing about you. He's insecure and he's trying to bring you down, so you don't leave him.   \nRemember that you are not alone, you have your doggo and your friends that love you and want you to be happy. You could also consider getting a therapist to help you heal your trauma and navigate the divorce in a healthy way.   \nI wish you the best of luck! You deserve better!",
            "Biggest red flag if I ever saw one is that he feels the need to watch porn to have sex with you, don\u2019t make the same mistake I did \ud83d\udc94 my ex couldn\u2019t perform unless watching porn and then it progressed into actively seeking it out instead of having intimate relations with me. He put more effort into trying to keep porn in his life than trying to have an actual sex life with me. I tried so hard to keep attractive, dressing sexy, make up, playing out fantasies, etc. then I realized he wasn\u2019t putting any effort on his side. Selfish. And the fact that he abandoned you for this job- another huge red flag now he wants back. I would almost think another woman was a reason instead of a job but I don\u2019t know that\u2019s just my thought. And when it didn\u2019t work out he wants to come back to you without you knowing. I wouldn\u2019t give him anymore chances \ud83d\udc94 I\u2019m so sorry you went through that.",

            "\u00b7 Firstly, congratulations, you've handled this like a champ. And the best part is you've already moved on really, you live in your own place! I know you mentioned you are deathly afraid of being alone but..be honest here. Isn't it nice being by yourself too? Not always wondering how your weight looks around him, trying to brush off him always watching porn etc? \n\nPlus You've got friends, good ones by the looks of it, lean on them for support and to comfort the occasional loneliness. \n\n\n\u00b7 Don't just start the paperwork. Talk to a lawyer, *yesterday*. But also today. You've abandoned your marital home which could hurt you. And your husband has lost his job. Both these can be bad for you in a divorce. It's only going to get worse once he realizes you are serious and decides to get his own lawyer. \nLet him think you're not serious if that's what he believes and use that time to assemble your defense and your assets. Do not relish in his denial and dawdle, it will not help you in the long run.",

            "I started dating my gf about 8 months ago. She was not skinny. She does have the most perfect, cute butt, ever. In the last 8 months, she's been stressed to hell and back about her new job. Her stress-eating is starting to interfere with her quality of life. When we started dating, she was about 120-ish. At a little over 5 foot, she was height-weight proportional. She has a scale and popped her 200lb mark about a month ago. \n\nI don't care. I love her laugh. I love her look, the one she gives when I'm massaging her legs, feet, etc., like I'm doing just the right thing. I love the way we go out: she is on my arm, I'm overprotective and giving her all my attention.  She is the one for me. Her body is incredible, for all the extra 80 pounds gained since we started dating. \n\nWhy tell an internet stranger this?  You deserve to be loved for who you are. I know plenty of chubby chasers who would worship the ground you walk on. But you don't want that. Maybe for your rebound, but not long term. You need an equal partner. You currently have a rat of a klingon, sucking your life out of you. \n\nFind your Romeo, and the guy needs be romantic with you, not just when you're around.",

            "Wow!  This reminds me of my friends. One was the husband who, whilst possessing good intentions, refused to grow up and support his wife (my other friend). Years of no support and impossible situations pushed her to a place where the relationship was irretrievably broken. She tried to engage through the years and he refused. Once it went too far for too long, it died. He woke up to this fact at the end and desperately tried to reconcile, to fix, to nurture, to save. But it was too late. He waited too long. I suspect  he\u2019ll always regret it and he subsequently fell into a downward spiral. She, on the other hand, became stronger once the cancer was removed from her soul. \nYou sound like a fair and loving person. This sounds like it\u2019s gone too far to repair. If so, hold your head high and be proud that you literally did everything you could to make it work even when it was killing you inside. Nobody can fault you, tell you you gave up or didn\u2019t care or didn\u2019t try. People like you make me think that maybe, just maybe, this world might be salvageable.",

I know it's hard, but you're doing great and I'm happy for you!\n\nWhat you said about being worried about being alone resonates with me, and I have some advice to offer that has helped me. For me a lot of it came down to not enjoying my own company, comparing whatever I was doing with the idea of the great things I'd be doing if I was with someone else. I needed to develop a relationship with myself where I did things that I enjoyed so that being alone was a positive baseline, and I wouldn't overextend myself for company that wasn't worth it.\n\nTo start, I prioritized spending time with myself. Then it wasn't a fallback, it was a choice. \n\nSecond, I made a list of simple things that I enjoy or always wanted to try, especially from when I was a child. If I wasn't sure what to do with myself I would do something from the list.\n\nThird, I thought of developing a friendship with myself in some ways as parenting my lost inner child or a feral animal. That was helpful to me, your mileage may vary, but viewing the parts of me that were skittish and hurt in that way would bypass all the internalized judgment. \n\nGood luck, may you have many happy days ahead of you.",

I didn\u2019t expect this post to receive much attention at all, so I\u2019m blown away. As we go into 2020, I wish you all the best in navigating and relationships in your life that need a little bit of TLC. I can\u2019t promise responses to all, but will do my best. \n\nTL;DR: I devoted my entire therapy session last weekend to discussing my mom. Trying to set healthy boundaries. She got engaged on Christmas and hasn\u2019t told me yet. Guess it really is a one way street. I don\u2019t feel guilty about not wanting to spend time with her.  \n\nAlthough there wasn\u2019t a clamor for an update, I wanted to let those that commented know I did indeed discuss with my therapist on the 21st, and it was a doozy of a session. She told me it sounded like a one-way street in terms of my mom never being the one to contact me, I\u2019ve always been her emotional support, and I cared so much but wasn\u2019t getting anything in return. \n\nIn fact, she recommended I start defining healthy boundaries immediately, but I decided that Christmas would be the worst time to start testing those waters. So I compromised with myself and sent her a Merry Christmas text, which she reciprocated but didn\u2019t attempt to continue the conversation. \n\nWhatever, right? I just let it go and thought that was that. \n\nNot exactly. I don\u2019t get onto Facebook but keep a profile so she can still tag me in inane memes and status updates. She knows this, but I always have to remind her when she sullenly asks me why I didn\u2019t like her last post. \u201cBut I\u2019m your mooooommmmmm!\u201d\n\nI find out at 9pm on Christmas night that she\u2019s engaged. But she didn\u2019t tell me - nope, my stepmom texted me to ask about it, and I was floored. It sort of opened the floodgates and I went from \u201cI don\u2019t care about her contact\u201d to \u201chow could she care so little about me?\u201d in seconds flat. \n\nIt\u2019s 3 days later and she still has yet to reach out to me about her engagement, but I did creep on her Facebook and she made a post about \u201cbeing so happy her kids (my siblings) were there to see it\u201d. To her knowledge, I\u2019m still in the dark. Now, she DID send me a FB message/video about 2 hours ago, but I\u2019m ignoring it and won\u2019t be contacting her at all until she decides to text or call me about her life update. \n\nBasically, I no longer feel obligated to feel guilty for not going to see her. I clearly don\u2019t rank high on her list of important people, and I\u2019m not going to try to make that happen so she feels like a better mother. I\u2019m looking forward to taking all of my PTO for myself and no one else.",

            "Wow. My dad got engaged and posted a video of it on Facebook. I found out on the toilet, after all our extended family had already liked and commented, despite the fact that *I lived with him* at the time of the proposal. Didn't see him for 3 days, he and his new fianc\u00e9e opted not to return any phone calls or texts from his children during that time.\n\nThe fact that your siblings were involved makes it suck even more. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.",
            "If you ever do go visit her, get a hotel room or airbnb so that you can choose when to see her and when you get to see your friends. That way she won't be able to hold you hostage like when you stayed with her.\n\nAlthough, if this was me I'd give her a good few years to miss me and I'd delete my facebook if the only reason you have it is for her. I'd also put her on an information diet and quit contacting her first completely. Only answer her if she texts first and only if you actually WANT to answer. Treat her like an annoying acquaintance, which she basically is at this point.",

Being angry at her for not including you brings you down to her level.

I'm glad you have therapy and won't have to do it alone.",

            "Reading your original post reminded me so much of a huge fight my own mom and I had just a few years ago. You and I are around the same age as well.\n\nI live on the East Coast, and at the time my parents were out west. I had planned a vacation to visit my best friend, who had also moved to the West coast, and in short, my mom was pissed that I didn't include her on the trip. The worst part was that I had tried to and even offered to pay for her transportation from CA to the PNW to spend a few days with me. I had also already made two trips to see her and my dad in recent years, but they didn't return the favor. At the last second, as I was on the phone trying to coordinate flights, she told me she needed to cancel. Then later, once I was on the trip and enjoying time with my friends I started receiving passive-aggressive phone calls and texts about how much fun it looked like I was having, which ultimately devolved into a huge fight wherein she told me what a terrible, selfish daughter I was for not including her. Mind you, I was 26 at the time of this argument and had worked really hard to make this trip happen, not to mention my parents were the ones who chose to move 3,000 miles away when I was 20.\n\nMy parents recently moved back to town (like 2 months ago) after nearly a decade away. Like you, I had abnormal boundaries with them growing up, and these days the bulk of my sessions with my own therapist center around my mommy issues. I'm now relearning how to navigate my relationship with my parents with this strange dynamic of me being on my own all these years and them suddenly being back in my day-to-day life.\n\nIf you ever want to talk, feel free to message me. It seems we have very similar stories as well as issues with our mothers. I wish you the best of luck as you work to establish some much needed boundaries. All the best.",
            "Let me tell you about my mom.  She was very abusive to me when I was growing up.  Once grown she only contacted me when she needed something.  She has had very little to do with my children.  Oddly she acts very different around her grandchildren than she did around me when I was their age.  \n\nA few years ago I found myself calling her every day it every other day checking on her and seeing if she needed anything.  She never answered my calls.  She would wait sometimes weeks to call me back.  When she did call me it was only to get me to do something for her. She never asked about me or my family.  I finally decided that I was giving her too much power in my life.  I quit calling and quit giving her any effort to maintain our relationship.  It took a month before she was asking why I wasn't calling her more often. I was truthful.  I told her that having to leave a voicemail everyday and never getting a call back told me that she didn't want a phone call so I'd not be calling and checking on her anymore.  \n\nMy life is much better with less contact.  The only time she calls is when she needs something so that hasn't changed.  Now I just don't worry or fret over her not calling me back.",
            "A Merry Christmas text does not exactly scream communication. A simple phone call along with what is new in your life to her might get her to open up. And a different therapist might provide better insight as to what is happening with different options to resolve it. Your mother does not matter in the long run, your mental health does. Part of good mental health is being able to say that you tried your best and she did not respond. Enjoy your PTO time.",
            "My husband's relationship with his father is the same. We found out on Thanksgiving that he hosted a bunch of people and did not invite my husband or our family.  Ok.  It always stings, but my husband knows where he stands and that there is nothing there now, so he has stopped looking for it.",
            "I really appreciate this update! I'm glad your therapist gave you some good advice and perspective, and I'm so sorry your mom is like this.",
            "This is my family. I was raised with this \"family first\" mentality but when it came down to it my parents nor my sibling put me first. It was always their lives and then me, which is honestly healthier. I should be able to make my own choices without being made to feel guilty for not thinking of family first. They do so why can't I?\n\nI changed this narrative for my daughter though. I told them so long as they aren't using us and trying to bring harm to our family, their lives are their own and I'm not going to be hurt if they choose to move or not be at home for the holidays. The only time it's not their lives is of it directly impacts ours negatively. That's where I draw the line.",
            "I feel like you would benefit from reading about the Grey Rock approach via google. I feel like you're doing things that are accidentally feeding into her drama. IMO the lowest drama way of dealing with this would have just been to called her when you found out or send her a congrats text. Right now it seems like you are building up for a blow up and she probably wants that to happen.",

I'm really proud of you for putting yourself first and dropping the rope with your mom, but I know it isn't easy. If you ever need anyrhing, feel free to PM me.",
            "In my experience, you\u2019re at the age where people start to examine their parental relationships as an adult. You\u2019ve likely already determined which of your siblings you want to keep close or \u201cless\u201d close. But the parental bond is stronger and in the absence of serious abuse issues it takes a few more years to define the boundaries of your adult relationship with parents. Guilt shouldn\u2019t be an issue with your parents anymore. They\u2019re not worried about what\u2019s on you mind or trying to make you happy anymore. They\u2019re busy building a future based on doing what makes them happy and saving for retirement. You should make decisions based on what\u2019s best for you, you don\u2019t owe them anything. The beauty of being an adult is you can stop doing things you don\u2019t enjoy, unless you have children. Lastly, FB, texting, snap or whatever are great for brief exchanges of information. But when it\u2019s important/emotional convo\u2019s do that in person ideally or on the phone. You can never be sure a message you convey through text or email will be understood by the recipient the way you intended.",

            "My mom sounds very much like yours. Self absorbed, unconcerned, even unloving. I literally only go see her (mind you its only like two hours round trip) when I absolutely have to. Basically when my sister doesn't want to go alone. I didn't even wish her a happy christmas. I couldn't be happier. \n\nWhat I'm trying to get at is that 'family' isn't everything. If you don't feel like this is a healthy relationship for you, and she isn't willing to work to improve it, there is no law saying you have to be a part of her life. \n\nI'm proud of you for setting boundaries and sticking to them.

            "You don't even need an awful example of her behavior to validate your dislike for time with your mom - some people are just at a negative lovely place in their lives and that's not your burden. \nYou made the right call regardless of  whether she shared her engagement update or not; now you just have an extra data point to keep in mind about how she prioritizes you in her life so you can better prioritize her in your own life. You need to come before her and that's healthy, and also a pattern it sounds like you're trying to learn.\nThis story is almost identical to mine up until my relationship with my mom imploded over my unwillingness to break my boundaries. I remember wasted PTO, feeling trapped and needing a vacation from this\"vacation\" of carrying her emotions and putting up with her filthy home and animals for the few days between the annoying airports and uncomfortable, but somehow incredibly expensive airline tickets. \nIt's weird but the further I get away, the healthier I'm becoming. Still in therapy since I want to yell at her for being the worst. Someday I'll love her through it all but I'm not there yet.\nGood luck.",

I called Christmas day just before dinner time (when my baby brother messaged me that they had gotten there) and because I was out walking my dog it took me 10 minutes to call so when I finally did they were just about to sit down to eat dinner so I told them give me a call when they were done and I started making dinner for me and my hubby (we had a quiet day in just the two of us).\n\nSo they call bout 10 minutes before our dinner was ready so I let them know but chatted with them anyways.... During this call (precious minutes to any normal person) all my family (my mom, dad, older brother, younger brother and his wife) got into an argument for 3 minutes about whose pop was sitting on the coffee table and all of them forgot I was on the phone.....

        "selftext": "Background: My best friend of 9 yrs, we'll call her Lola, (20F) and I (20F) are quarantining at our apartment together. .She's trans and has had trouble growing her hair out, so she wears wigs. She has some really cute ones in other colors that she wears for fun and stuff, but she has a standard everyday wig she wears most of the time. \n\nLola never got the traditional girly childhood, so we've been making one for her in quarantine. We built a fort in the living room, have been making friendship bracelets, playing summercamp-style games. It's a lot of fun!! Last week, Lola mentioned to me that she wanted to start a quarantine diary so that she could document her experiences for future generations. I actually thought it was really cool, and then we got on the topic of journaling and I told her about my first diary - one of those flismy lock diaries that every girl had as a kid.\n\nWe bought matching ones as part of our \"give Lola her childhood back\" crusade. They took a little while coming in, but we got them on Friday. Saturday night, some of our friends from college decided to do an impromptu girl's night in. Lola was in the shower, so I answered the Zoom without her. \n\nSide note: Lola is NOT out to anybody at our college and I respect that. This is her fresh start and she has a right to decide when she wants to come out to these people, if at all. I know I wouldn't 100% trust some of the people at our school with something as personal as this.\n\nWe were talking about what we've been doing in quarantine and I mentioned that we had gotten the diaries. I said it was for the nostalgia and they wanted to see the diaries. We left the box in Lola's room, so I went in to show them. Lola and I go into each other's rooms all the time - we're basically sisters to one another, and it's just about second nature. When we were younger, we had keys to each other's houses. I didn't think anything of it.\n\nI flipped the camera to show the diaries and didn't flip it back. I got distracted by a cute choker on her dresser and forgot that the camera was flipped/there was anything to hide. They knew Lola has worn wigs out to parties/the club/etc. but her everyday wig was right out in plain view, and one of our nosier friends asked what the \"new wig\" was. I completely bluescreened and someone else realized that it was Lola's hair. I genuinely had nothing to say. They were asking why Lola wore a wig and I had no explanation. I didn't want to out her.\n\nSomeone else came to the conclusion that Lola must have cancer or alopecia or some other horrible thing that causes hair loss. They've decided that she was just too embarrassed to say, and they all started going on about \"poor Lola\" etc. I just didn't know what to say and I said it wasn't my place to confirm/deny. I hung up and immediately told Lola. I apologized profusely, and I know how badly I fucked up. I feel so guilty about it. But, understandably, she's upset.\n\nNow, she's being forced to decide whether or not to out herself. Lola, understandably, doesn't want to lie about having some serious disease and people are already trying to \"show support.\" At the same time, though, she doesn't want to have to come out. I don't know wha tto do. I want to support her, but she doesn't want to even see me right now.\n\nTL;DR: I exposed my friend's wigs and have put her in a tough spot. What are good ways to help and support her? Should I try to do damage control and tell people to just butt out? What good can I do in this situation?",

Remember to force the \"obsessed with one particular animal\" phase into your childhood recreation. Every girl goes through that phase. My best friend had dolphins, and I think everything I owned had a tiger on it for about two years straight! She's gotta pick an animal and obsess over it for a bit. I don't make the rules.",
            "I agree with other comments saying Lola should be honest that she wants long hair but struggles growing it out. I want to add that the key part of this delivery is to be totally nonchalant about it. If Lola is just like \"oh ya those are my wigs, my damn hair is so thin, what did you guys have for lunch?\" It'll hopefully be glossed over versus making a thing of it. And you can always be honest and say you froze up because you weren't sure what Lola would want you to say.

From there, help her to figure out how she would like to tell them about this topic. Ask her if she would like you to clear it up, or if she wants to do it on her own. \n\nOther than that, continue being your supportive self.",
            "She definitely doesn't have to out herself, I understand you're both panicking but that's kind of a wild conclusion to jump to. As others have pointed out, plenty of cis women wear wigs for the exact same reason Lola does. And frankly, Lola doesn't have to tell anyone about why she wears the wigs. If anyone has the gall to ask \"So do you have cancer?\" then obviously she should put the record straight, but frankly Lola's reasons for wearing wigs is none of anyone else's business, so let them assume what they want. Your friends will forget about it soon enough.",
            "There's a third option: Tell them she doesn't like her natural hair and wigs make her feel more confident without having to dye and process her natural hair. Tell them that her hair is thin, brittle, damaged, hard to grow, whatever you want, and that the wigs make her feel pretty, but she doesn't want to talk about it because it's a sore spot. Hell, she can even tell them \"because I like to\" and if they ask for more information she just can say \"it saves me so much time\" or \"you know that feeling when you take your bra off after a long day? I get that with my wig too\" or \"because I think it's cool.\" I've had tones of friends do \"weird\" things that when asked, just say something along the lines \"I like to, it's cool\" and that's that. She doesn't HAVE to tell people the truth, and she might feel better being reminded it's not just trans girls and cancer patients that wear wigs anymore. Look up Glam & Gore. A completely normal girl who in pretty much all of her videos wears wigs. Most celebrities wear wigs too: most of the Kardashian-Jenners, Rihanna, Cardi B.... I'm sure there's dozens more, but that's who I can think of off hand.",
            "You sound like a really great friend and I'm glad she has somebody so supportive as you.\n\nAs far as giving your friends a reason as to why she wears a wig she can always just say something like \"I just like to wear them.\" She doesn't need to have some reason other than the basic truth. She doesn't have to go on with a further explanation on why she likes to wear wigs. She can keep it as vague and nonchalant as she wants to. Also your friend group aren't exactly entitled to an explanation, they should respect her privacy even if she never addresses it.",
            "Wigs are SUPER common. Trust me. And honestly I wish I had the funds for a few good ones. It's no big deal, and your friend should really consider just saying, \"I'm fine, I just like to play with different styles since my hair doesnt grow as easily as I'd like.\"\n\nMany women and men use wigs to do just that, and to experiment with colors. Heck, I had a friend in high school that had several wigs of different colors because her hair couldn't handle changing as often as she would like.",
            "Want to start with you sound like a lovely friend.\n\nI get that you both panicked, but what\u2019s wrong with keeping the answer simple and honest? She\u2019s had trouble in the past growing long hair and prefers to use wigs? You might have already raised suspicions by acting frazzled and making it a bigger deal than it is, but that\u2019s what I would go with.",

Shaved because of damage from bad dye job?  \n\nKeeps it cut short because of easier maintenance?  Likes the low maintenance of wigs over real hair?  Likes the switch ability of wig life?  \n\nBecause none of your business other than I\u2019m healthy, thanks?  \n\nI hope you and Lola can patch things up!",
            "I mean - without outing her as trans and not telling a lie like she has cancer or something, she could simply tell the truth; she's tried to grow out her hair multiple times, but it's too thin and it looks odd when it's grown longer than a certain lenght.",
            "I didn\u2019t realize we needed reasons to wear everyday wigs. Seems like a weird question to ask someone.",

This post got a lot of traction, someone is bound to find it. It's specific enough that it'll be instantly recognizable. What you described here is an honest mistake, but actually outing her when one of your friends finds this post is going to turn this into a nightmare for Lola.\n\nThere's some stellar advice in this thread! Probably more than you'll ever need to deal with this. Best of luck, and you seem like an awesome friend by the way!",

            "All the other answers are so good! She can just say she prefers wigs to her natural hair bc her natural hair is brittle or thin or something and she spent so much on products trying to fix it that she just bought a wig. Or that she just prefers wigs or can\u2019t grow her hair out. The growing out thing is also perfect bc that implies that once she grows it out, she\u2019ll stop, so when she suddenly has different hair when she stops wearing the wig they won\u2019t be like wtf. \n\nOr, really, I think if she were to lie and say she has like female baldness or something, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s so horrible. OR she could say she shaved it to support a friend with cancer and ended up being really insecure about it? Idk. These are still all lies haha, I just wouldn\u2019t blame you for wanting to lie. Lola\u2019s peace of mind is so important and I definitely don\u2019t think she needs to come out over this if she doesn\u2019t 100% want to.\n\nAlso I second that you\u2019re an amazing friend for being so supportive and honest with her!! Truly a treasure, I\u2019m so glad y\u2019all are friends :-)",

It's the truth and Lola doesn't have to out herself.",
            "My grandmother, a cis woman with no applicable skin conditions, wore a wig for much of her teaching career until she got older because she's always had very fine hair that wouldn't even grow to her shoulders and she liked having long curly hair. I'd encourage Lola to tell the surface truth that she enjoys having long hair but struggles to grow it out so she wears a wig instead, just like somebody who has wavy hair may use a flat iron daily to achieve straight hair.",
            "my cousin is a cis woman and wears wigs because she has very thin hair. thats all she has to say to your friends",
            "You could say she buzzed her hair but missed the length so she's wearing a wig until it grows out. Or you could say she's trying out different styles. I knew a cis girl who would just throw on different wigs because she wanted a new look without the full investment of actually dying/cutting her hair. Doesn't have to be anything 'out' related.",
            "I mean, she doesn't have to mention being trans whatsoever. Having trouble growing long hair doesn't have anything to do with gender, so she can just honestly say that she loves long hair but is struggling to grow hers out so she wears wigs in the meantime. \n\nSide note, does she have curly hair? I know people with curls often have a harder time growing theirs out because it can be delicate and break more easily. If so...r/curlyhair plug to help her grow it out :)",
            "It's really not that deep. She is growing out her hair and wants it long so she's wearing a wig. Cis women do it all the time.",

            "Or just go with this: she bleached her own hair a while ago and it fell out. She started wearing wigs then and got hooked on them. Or her hair is still fried. But then I\u2019d ask for everyone to please stop discussing it because it is very personal.",
            "Trust me, this is a small slip up more than you think. It is not as bad as it seems. She doesn\u2019t need to put herself! Any gender can struggle to grow her. That sounds more like a genetics thing and it certainly isn\u2019t alopecia. Some people tend to grow hair faster than others. All that needs to be said to nip it in the bud is that she prefers to wear wigs and that she prefers them because her hair isn\u2019t as long as she desires. Chalk it up to a bad haircut if you need to. There are a lot more reasons than you\u2019d think. Also, it shouldn\u2019t be that surprising since she wears wigs often and they are aware of that. \n\nTo add, I knew quite a bit of people that wear wigs themselves. Sometimes, I\u2019ve never seen someone\u2019s natural hair. It\u2019s just their thing and I like that they have options on hairstyle lol. \n\nDon\u2019t worry. You and Lola will be okay :)",
            "Depending on race, she doesn't have to out herself, \"I just find it easier to get the style I want this way. My natural hair is super curly / poker straight and wispy fine... no one can cut it or they charge a fortune... so I just crop my natural hair and wear wigs!\" \n\nI mean, if she feels comfortable with them later it can be an update, but I would go for a natural hair that is unmanageable - she can say no one else in her family has it so she never got styling tips then just change the subject if they want to offer tips etc she can deflect with \"But I was thinking of buying a new pink one, what do you think...?\"",
            "Why does she need to out herself as trans? Sounds like you've outed her wig-wearing-ness, but that's nothing to do with being trans. Most trans people don't wear wigs. I'm not sure how the two are forcibly related.",
            "7/8 years ago I had a wig due to losing all my hair to chemo, we did start a picture with miranda (that was the wigs name ) on her travels,  we took pictures of her on anything and everywhere , never be ashamed of a syrup,  she should stand up look fabulous and own and style that wig life !!",
            "It sounds like Lola was really invested in hiding her wigs, and maybe you were a little careless to show them, but it was an honest mistake. \n\nThese friends don't seem like they are negatively judging her for wearing a wig! It sounds like they are saying \"poor Lola\" because they think she must be seriously ill if she \"doesn't have hair\"\n\nI don't think she has to lie or out herself at all.  She can just say to the friends \"I'm not sick, my hair doesn't grow quickly so I wear a wig\"",

Now I sometimes wear shorter ones to have shorter hair for a moment. \n\nI would make sure Lola knows there are many woman who wear wigs of all types for many many reasons. I think if she/you just said that she got a shorter haircut a bit ago and she just really wants her long hair back but it's taking forever to grow out, people would understand. If they don't that is their problem. I have worn a wig to get my \"old long hair\" back before.",

Some are colorful and different and others just look like standard hairstyles.\n\nI agree with other posters. Chock it up to it being something she enjoys and that's that. She can mention she has struggled growing out long hair too, because that's the truth. But I don't think she needs to feel obligated out herself because of this.",

You handled yourself beautifully with love and honesty. It was an accident, but an accident that demonstrates that some things are inevitable, like the truth coming out. It\u2019s not even that people are nosey, we\u2019re just observant. I wonder if your friend has thought about the position you are in by having to keep her secrets. I think it would be a good idea to address this with her moving forward. Like if your other friends ask, or if people in general start asking, what one sentence answer should you give them? That way you\u2019re not responsible for her secrets, and you\u2019re not risking outing her. I have a feeling as time passes these situations will continue to arise.",

            "Used to work with a cis gal that wore wigs for some personal reason I never fully knew. (I did know that she was cis because she told me, we talked about trans issues often.) She told me about it just on her own, but another group of friends found out after they went swimming together and her wig fell off.\n\nShe was super embarrassed but like . . . no one judged her or, to my knowledge, asked her about it much. I would generally expect that people aren't going to bother her much. If they do, they're weird and should be told to fuck off.\n\nAs for your relationship to Lola, give her a little space. You've already apologized. You might want to do so again when/if she starts talking again and you're getting a signal that she wants one. But if you overdo it, it'll just serve as a way to keep bringing it up and may seem like an attempt to shift focus to comforting your guilt. Once she's accepted the apology, move on--if you need help assuaging your guilt, don't try to get it from her, she's busy healing from betrayal, find it from another source. But *do* do other things to reinforce that you're her friend and want to support her (without drawing attention back to what happened).",
            "It\u2019s kind of a lifesaver here that you kept it \u201cno comment\u201d and moved on. Hopefully your friends wouldn\u2019t be so ready to make any concrete presumptions about Lola\u2019s health let alone spread any news to others (I think [i hope] it\u2019s a universally understood common courtesy that you don\u2019t walk around telling people that someone has a disease)\n\nAs far as explaining that to Lola, it wouldn\u2019t be very helpful even if the above is true and it ends up being not that big of a deal. It was an honest mistake that has now nudged her into the high- pressure decision making process of now figuring out what she wants to do. This may emotionally have been a dose of reality for her that\u2019s now putting her in a pivotal place. However, you\u2019ve apologized and that\u2019s all you can do (not saying that that\u2019s a bad thing), the best thing to do now is support her through her decision making if she needs you.\n\nEdit: yes, damage control would be a good thing to offer up right now. if you\u2019re friends are \u201cshowing support\u201d, tell them they need to be mindful of Lola\u2019s privacy and that she will let them know if she needs their advocacy",

It's literally a synonym for the word baldness which I would say is close enough to the truth that it's not actually a lie. Besides that some people here are saying to just say that she has trouble growing her hair out. That may be even better because it's even more vague. Don't feel obligated to give them details. The vaguer the better. Just to reiterate, saying somebody has alopecia is already very vague. It just means they're bald. Nothing more specific.\n\nAlso, she's probably upset because she would never make that mistake. Keeping this a secret must be second nature to her so even showing her room to people must be a big thing to her.

It was an accident, and she will come to understand that. It was a great thing that you did not give an answer to the college friends, because then she has the choice to come out for herself if she wants to. \n\nAgain, the most important thing is that you explain to her that you are there for her through thick and thin.

        "selftext": "I started using drugs when I was 17. I was mostly into meth but I tried various drugs. My parents decided to help me but like most addicts I struggled and made their lives difficult. There were times that I embarrassed them in front of people, I stole from them and from the rest of the extended family. I did a lot of wrong.\n\nWhen I was 23 they decided that they've wasted enough time and money on me so they cut me loose. It took me until I was 26 to get my act together and become clean. I went back to them when I was clean when they told me that they can't just take me back and forget about everything that I've done. They were right. I had to try to make things right.\n\nSo I stayed around but kept my distance from them. I started paying them back the money that I had stolen from them, and I paid that in full with interest within three years. That's everything that I stole from my parents and my sisters. I know it doesn't make it right but it's all that I could do. I kept sending them birthday cards and gifts, New Years cards, etc even though I wasn't with them at any of those events. Again, just trying to atone for the wrong I've done to them.\n\nYears passed, nothing changed. My sisters married and didn't invite me to their weddings. I still sent them gifts. When my niece and nephew were born I also sent them gifts. When I married my wife they didn't come to my wedding even though I invited them. When my son was born they didn't come to see him or to his birthdays after that.\n\nTwo years ago my father had cancer. I reached out and asked if he wanted to see me and offered my support. They all declined. It took them until my father was really sick to reach out. He wanted to finally see me. I went to see him in the hospital with my son. He was very sick and was more or less ready to go. He told me then that he regrets keeping me away and wishes that he'd accepted me back sooner. We spent a whole day together. We were full of regrets but we made our peace in the end. He died a week later.\n\nMy mother and sister told me not to come to his funeral. That I didn't deserve to be there. It was hurtful since my father and I had made our peace but I respected their wishes. The funeral is for those who remain and they had the right to not want me around. I went but remained in far distance and only paid my respects when everyone else was gone. That moment was a big deal for me. I stopped trying to have my mother and sisters back. I stopped sending them gifts or cards or anything. I had tried for 10 years and I decided that it's time to move on.\n\nWe remained no contact for two years until this last weekend. My mother called me and asked if I can visit them alone. I went there and my mother and sisters were there. We talked a little. They told me that they're willing to put the past behind us and look towards the future, that's all we have is each other, things like that.\n\nThe thing is, I got the feeling that they need money and help. They kept mentioning how difficult things are for them, how my sisters are both divorced and single mothers without \"great\" careers and how they struggle to take care of their children. My mother said similar things. They kept mentioning how great I'm doing and how amazing is it that I was able to turn my life around. I totally felt like I was being manipulated. For years I would have done anything for them to accept me back and now they were tapping into those feelings. They never explicitly asked for money but their requests were implicit. They said things like \"family should take care of each other\".\n\nSo I need some advice. I'm hurt that the reason they want me back is for money. I loved them and tried for 10 years and received no forgiveness when they didn't need me but now that they need me, I'm loved and great? What should I do?\n  \n**tl;dr**: During my times of drug use I put my family through a lot and they eventually stopped helping me. When I became clean I tried for 10 years to atone for my mistakes and they didn't accept me. They didn't allow me to attend my father's funeral. Now they tell me that they want me back and are implicitly asking for my help. What should I do? ",

            "What you should do is... Not give them money.\n\nYes, you caused them harm but you repaid those damages years ago.  They refused to allow you to be part of your father's funeral even after you made peace with him.  It would have cost them nothing to permit you to be a part of that.\n\nI agree that they want money.  It's especially telling that they insisted that you meet them without your wife.  They still don't want to be involved in your life.  They don't want to meet your wife or child.\n\nDon't give them money.  Next time you're having a gathering (holiday BBQ this summer?), invite your mother, sisters, and their children.  My guess is they won't come.  They don't want to be your family, just your pensioners.  If I'm wrong, and they want a real relationship, keep money out of the equation (don't give them any).",
            "If they end up asking for money, say no. Their reaction to that should tell you a lot.",
            "Take it slow. Learn what they're after. If it's money, don't do it. Not allowing you at the funeral is a major major deal though.",
            "They made their beds man. It sucks, because i am sure that this is hurtful for you because you love them. That is evident. But seriously- look at the things you did, on your own, that were ignored for years. And then the deal with your dad- that was an awful thing to do, and im glad that you went anyway. He was your father too. That shit about \"family should take care of each other\"? You are part of that family. You always have been, and they have completely cut you out for years. No. They dont get to invite you back with open arms and empty wallets. That makes them seem like terrible people, and you have every right to be disgusted by them. I think you should write them a letter and lay it all out. Say you would love to be a member of the family again, but that you can not and will not offer financial assistance in order for that to happen. You paid back the money you stole, with interest. You spent years turning your life around and you did it on your own. You owe them nothing. ",
            "Addiction is hard. It is hard to beat, it is hard to deal with, and it is hard to survive. It is abusive to the person addicted and those around them. Addiction doesn't just stay within a small circle of harm, usually. It can destroy lives. \n\nGood for you. I am glad you are doing well for yourself. \n\nIt is time to let go of the guilt you felt. Everyone acted badly in the whole situation. So I would go forward like you would with strangers. They are new people and they do not instantly get to have your help just because they ask.\n\nYes, you love them, but have they honored your love? \n\nI get that you hurt them 10+ years ago, but they cannot keep blaming you while expecting you to just do nice things for them. That is not how it works. They should want a relationship with you, not your wallet. ",
            "Tread carefully and do not provide any financial assistance. You spent years trying to prove yourself to them to no avail until now. You're right to have your suspicions.",
            "I am a recovering addict with much less sober time than yourself. For a time, my parents and family had cut me off just like yours did. While I never stole from them, I was a constant drain on their resources - my parents bought me multiple cars (despite me totaling one after another), paid for my lawyers whenever I got caught with drugs by police, and then there were the numerous times they paid my rent or bills while I was in rehab or the hospital (I always went to facilities covered by my insurance, so they weren't paying for that at least).\n\nYou know what happened after I finally got out of jail and had found sobriety inside? My father picked me up and took me straight home for a family dinner. \n\nYour mother and sisters actions are horrendous. Even when I was still using and my parents were barely speaking to me they let me come to my Grandfathers funeral. Hell, even when I got married (high as a kite) to my junkie girlfriend, my parents came to the wedding. \n\nIf they were truly family they would have forgiven you years ago. ",

His words, \"Son I really feel for your situation and I want to let you know that even though you've done wrong in the past you have done a whole lot of right for the past decade. Your family was and is wrong to have cut you out when you were in a real hard spot.

            ">They told me that they're willing to put the past behind us and look towards the future, that's all we have is each other, things like that.\n\nThis seems extremely disingenuous to me. Like a cop out. \"We ignored you and ostracized you from the family for years even though you were working on yourself and proving you wanted to get better, but now that you've finally ignored us and moved on with your life we're maybe thinking it's time we forgive you.\" \n\nIf you ask me it's up to you to forgive them for the bullshit they did to you. they wouldn't let you go to your dads funeral, ignored your efforts to reach out, took your money and gifts without so much as a thank you or attempt to get together. They didn't even come to your wedding. I mean how much more of a \"fuck you\" could they have given you? \n\nI'd watch your back around them, they sound like shitty people who shouldn't be trusted. If it was me I'd just say they had their chance for 10 years and you've decided to move on. Focus on the people in your life that actually give a shit about you. ",
            ">They said things like \"family should take care of each other\"\n\nPft hypocrites. So did they only decide this when it became convenient for them?\n\nI would stay in (low) contact however I would make it clear that they won't be getting any financial help, since it feels like the reason they are willing to mend fences is because they only want to use you for money. If you give them anything, it would have to be a loan (signed contract included) and not to exceed $500 until the previous loan is paid off with interest. This is what they did to you, essentially.\n\nMy suspicion is that they also kept you out of the funeral because they were afraid you might try to claim something from your father's will (if he had one) and any further interactions around his death would increase the chances/likelihood of you inquiring about his will and seeking a share of the pie. I know it sounds dumb but greedy people do think this way when it comes to end-of-life and inheritances - a \"don't let them feel any more invested in the deceased or they'll ask about inheritances\" thing.",

            "This is a heartbreaking story.

            "If you decide to reunite with them, I would be very very careful. They sound very cold and unforgiving. Your instincts about their motives are probably correct, so if you start seeing them they might hurt you again by trying to use you. \n\n>What should I do?\n\nYou could tell them that you agree that \"family should take care of each other\" but by cutting you off for 10 years you don't feel cared for. You would be willing to meet with them a few times and see how it goes, but you are saving your money for your wife and your son and you cannot help them financially. Then hold the line, and if they stay close and loving then you can perhaps start to trust them again and be family.",
            "Seems like some great advice in here. All I can say is good on you. You don't hear of people getting out of meth very often. You sound like you did it, did it right, and even went above and beyond what many people would have expected. \n\nGood fucking job. ",

Everyone can earn their chance at redemption, and it really seems like you did that (unless you're leaving out something big that would make them cut you out).\n\nBut since you want to get back together, don't give them money. In the same way that you pulled your life together after they cut you loose and stopped enabling you, do the same for them. Don't enable them. If you don't want to feel like you're being manipulated, then don't let them do it. If they really want to be a family again then they won't try to hold their love behind a paywall, and they won't mind getting to know you're wife and kids.",

            "My suggestion is to match their efforts. If they invite you to something, you invite them to something. If they call you, you call them. If they give you a gift, you give them a gift. See how you feel doing this.\n\nI doubt they will be giving you money, so don't give them any.",

Did they finally forgive you? If so, did you feel it was genuine forgiveness? This is very important.\n\n\n> \"family should take care of each other\"\n\nHow exactly they take care of you now? What exactly do they do or planning to do? They cannot play \"we did take care of you when you was young\" card anymore after you paying your debt with interest, all your attempts to re-connect and their ignoring you completely.\n\n\n>What should I do?\n\nBaby steps. \n\nPhone calls, social networks... start sharing your life with them. See what they share with you. Plan some re-union or, say July 4th celebration, etc.\n\nIf all they share with you is how they are in trouble and how their life is difficult, - that would be a red flag. Listen to you guts.\n\nIf you want to help them with money - do it, but make sure it's for very specific thing, not just a handout and you control how it's spent (for example, if they have a broken car - you find a mechanic or two, you talk to them and make sure proper diagnostics performed before they come up with an estimate - and then you pay directly to this mechanic). See how they react, see how you feel about the whole thing. See how quick they ask to help them with something else. Don't commit to give them any money in future. Every case is special and every time you need to think. See their reaction if you decline to give them money or help where you think it's not very much needed.\n\nThe fact that your sisters are divorced is a factor: they may or may not care about you as a person, but they need to live off of somebody who can make their life less difficult. Hard to say how much it weights, you will judge it by their reaction on photos of your son, your phone calls, events in your life and what they share with you.\n\nGood luck, man!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "If they truly wanted to be a part of your life, then they would have made the effort sooner. It sounds like they are fishing for a handout now that the train of gifts etc has stopped from you trying to atone for your past wrongs. \"Family should take care of each other\" huh? Well what about all those years ago when they cut you loose (I know it was the catalyst to get you back on track which I might add i applaud you for getting yourself straightened up and back on your feet), what about when your father was initially sick, surely family would have mattered then? Or being invited to your sisters weddings/to meet your niece and nephew, or coming to your wedding and meeting your son? If family mattered so much to them they would have made the effort before now. Ten years of you atoning for any wrongs you committed is a long time, and they could have made an effort at any point. Except, now your dad is gone, and after two years with no gifts etc from you, suddenly they want to know you? Adding to the hints etc about struggling etc, it really sounds like they are struggling with things, and see your desire to be accepted back in to the family as something to manipulate you in to handing over money and possibly items too. As for what to do? Completely ignore any and all hints, subtle requests and outright demands for any financial assistance. Except perhaps to point them in the direction of any state aid schemes, benefits they may be entitled to, or charities that might assist them. And if they get pushy, walk away. Foe twelve years they did not want to know you despite your efforts. They can reap the rewards of that.",

It's now going to be your obligation to help them financially and they will use your past to cause you guilt.\n\nDon't play their game. It seems you've come to peace with your past. Hold onto that, because then they can't make you feel guilty. When they indicate that it is your obligation, question their lack of obligation when you were recovered and sober.",

Ask yourself - if you didn't have money would they still want to reconcile?  They made their bed, let them lie in it.",

You made up for what you did to them more than a decade ago but now is the time to be selfish again. They cannot have you in their life merely because it's convenient. They should want you because it's the right thing to do. \n\nAnd they will think they're doing the right thing and they will think that asking you for money is their right. And this will get very difficult and may severe ties forever. But you must make a decision. How long will you be a walking may for them to atone for what teenager you did so long ago? ",
            "There's no fault with either decision you make. There's nothing wrong with refusing to have a relationship with them, and there's nothing wrong with forgiving them and helping them financially. There's nothing wrong with forgiving them and not giving them money, and nothing wrong with not forgiving them and helping them financially anyway. It comes down to what you decide is best for you. How important is a relationship with immediate family to you? What does forgiveness mean to you? You saw that even though you made amends, they still chose not forgive you. You in turn have the same option, to forgive or not forgive, independent from them. \n\nTheir actions were completely hurtful in my opinion, and I don't think they should have taken mistakes YOU made that YOU had/have to live with, to punish you. With that being said, there's a reason (valid to you or not) that they chose not to forgive you. Do you know what that reason is? I'd suggest having a conversation, alone, with your mother first. Discover the extent to which you hurt her, and share the extent to which she hurt you. From there I think you'll know what you need to do. Don't feel obligated to act in any way, the only obligation you have is to yourself. ",

At this point, they owe YOU more than you owe them.  Love them.  Provide them a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to, but under no circumstances, should you GIVE them money.  A tank of gas here and there would be as far as I stretch it, only to make sure they can get to work or take the kids to appointments.  MAYBE a bag of groceries if things REALLY get rough, but do NOT pay their bills.  Do NOT feed their lifestyle.  Do NOT allow them to play on the past and manipulate you into revisiting your guilt.

You may have been the addict but if you went through any 12 step program worth its salt you should already realize they were enablers and I am fairly certain they do not care if you are using or not, as long as you can give them what they want (money, whatever).

Your family obviously doesn't handle forgiveness well and I agree that the way, and timing, with how they are  attempting to come back into your life is troubling. Money aside, I would have to wonder if letting their particular brand of toxicity back into your life wouldn't be detrimental, not just to you but your wife and children as well. Could they be sincere and familial ties be reestablished? Possibly, but it seems to me that you would have little to no control over making it happen/true at this point. \n\nI don't have an answer for what you should do, OP, but I definitely think that they are the ones who should be atoning now.",

            "Congratulations to you, first of all. I have a lot less clean time than you and had I been in your position I don't think I would have handled it nearly as maturely or with such grace and dignity and kindness. That being said, you know inside what's best for you. At this point, just because they are family, doesn't mean you owe them anything. You know if you're being used. Don't let them do that to you. They say that sometimes after all of this shit, you have to find new family. Loving family members do not use manipulation tactics or purposefully exploit you to get what they want, even if they truly think they deserve it. And just to be clear, they don't. You've done more than enough. Best of luck to you, OP!",
            "Keep in contact with them if that's what you want to do. But remember you are worthy of your own boundaries. Keep them as close or as distant as you want. You are worthy and you don't owe them anything. ",

My older cousin pretty much went through the exact same thing as you. Stole, lied, everything. We never gave up on him though no matter how hard it was. Family sticks together in hard times. You've paid your debts and I don't think your family deserves you in their lives, but hey, we all make mistakes. Do what you think is right. If you are financially able to help them, without jeopardizing your own life, then help them. Explain to them how you feel hurt if the only reason they are finally reaching out is for financial help. But either way, try to repair those relationships. Learn from your dad's last moments with you before it's too late. Best of luck with your decision.",

A healthy/healing family unit will want to get to know your wife/kids, and attempt to eliminate the separation.\n\nUltimately, no amount of advice should provide you with a decision, it can only guide you through the path to YOUR decision.\n\nI would advise before you do anything; that you discuss things with your wife and lay out:\n\n-  What you would expect from this re-integration\n-  What you will and will not do\n-  Immediate \"Fouls\"\n-  Financial limits\n\netc, etc...

Not to say that you shouldn't feel responsible for your own life and your actions: you have to be. But life is a cycle and it takes a village and all that: the environment and your upbringing play a role. \n\nWhatever they case, their reaction to your recovery certainly has been dysfunctional. I'm curious: \n\n* What stress did your addiction put on the family?\n\n* What were each of your family members reaction to your addiction over time?\n\n* Was there any relationship with a particular family member that could have contributed to the development of an addiction?\n\n* Did anything happen in your childhood which could be considered traumatic?\n\n* Anyone else in your family have addictive or escapist type behavioral issues? Video games, drugs, alcohol?",
            "Ok, basically you repaid and repaired the financial relationship with them. You don't owe them money UNLESS you really want to help.\n\nNow it is the time to repair the emotional relationship. Talk to your mother alone and to each of your sisters alone. Tell them exactly that - that you feel like you're done with the financial repayment and now it's time for emotional repair, that you understand that they need to learn to know and to trust you. And that it will be building a relationship from the beginning. \n\nThey need to know that you will see through a manipulation, but you are willing to have them as you family.",

Their choice of course and rightfully so. You hurt them. \n\nNow they want you back after your father has passed. Also their choice. It is also your choice to keep ties cut with them. Disregarding the fact that they seem to be asking for help/money, I personally would tell them to fuck off.

I think that you should follow your instincts. If you want I have a relationship with your family, then you should take this opportunity, but don't give them any more money. If that's all they want then they're taking advantage of you and they'll be gone again soon when you don't give them money.

Not only did they finish you, but they punished your family. \n\nMost people, after a few years of consistent apologies and staying sober want their lives ones back. They might ease into it. But if they loved you, they would find a way to love you, even during the times you didn't love yourself. \n\nThey have no interest in being your family. They just want to use you.

But they not only rejected your attempts to return when you initially got sober, but continued that rejection when you married, when you had a family and when your father passed. And they did that for longer than they had to deal with your adddiction.\n\nIf you want a relationship with them then you should pursue it, but on your terms. And in your place I'd insist that one of those terms is showing some kind of remorse. ",

I actually was quite surprised by the resounding gong of how terrible he is and needed a lot of time to digest the responses. My first reaction was that I exaggerated or only put one side into the story and that he isn't really that bad. \n\nThe switch flipped for me after a few series of events in the last 2 months. First I wanted to sign up our oldest child up for a weeknight evening activity. And my husband was not fond of the idea, but when I kept pushing he said if I did signup it was all on me and that I was not \"allowed\" to get frazzled or stressed out on the day of the activity. I realized he doesn't want to signup because he doesn\u2019t want to change his quality of life. \n\nShortly after that, he was travelling for work and I was lying in bed alone and I realized I hadn't gotten my period in a while. Open my app to check when its due, I'M ON DAY 52 OF MY CYCLE! And we had sex immediately before my fertility window. I cannot be pregnant. I panicked. And I didn't even want to tell him. I feared telling him. I still haven't told him 2 months later. (I thankfully just skipped a cycle.)\n\nI started fantasizing what it would look like to split time with our kids. Casually looking for work to see what is out there if/when we break up. And totally talking about it with my girlfriends. \n\nThen one lunch (in front of the kids) out of nowhere we had a colossal fight (for us). Surprisingly (and quite out of character) I was totally calm. And when he would go at me with \"is this what the next 35 years of our lives will be like?\" I would just say \"I hope not.\"  And when he said something about divorce, I just said \"that doesn\u2019t scare me.\" I was solidly expecting to be fighting all Christmas because I really thought the best thing would be to separate. And he now knew that was something I was considering.\n\nA couple hours later he was SUPER sweet. Telling me he'll never stop fighting for us, and that I am the best at everything I do (which is true \ud83d\ude09 ).  And that he just wanted us to be better. That he would be better.  \n\nIn the couple days that followed, he said a couple of things to our kids that make me cringe. I'm sure some people parent with shame intentionally but I am NOT okay with it. And I immediately called him on it and told him that was one of the things I did not like. He seems to have taken note and has not done it since. He is taking an interest in an entrepreneurial project of mine, which is a complete 180 from before. It is just an interest when I want to talk about a new idea or spin on something (related to my project) he is mostly dismissive, but will tolerate me talking about it. \n\nOur 6th anniversary came and went over the holiday break - he remembered a couple days before but did not plan anything. The day of was forgettable. He did however, buy me grocery store flowers and write a nice note in a card.\n\nI still feel skeptical. I\u2019m hesitant and I don\u2019t know if this is genuine. We are attending a work conference in a month for his company and I am concerned that his change in attitude is to \u201ckeep me in line\u201d so we present well and I don\u2019t embarrass him. I feel like he is trying to check the boxes that he thinks will make me happy without actually put in real effort. I also feel like he is trying and I should give him a chance. I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nTLDR: An update to an [old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d5my92/my_f31_husband_m34_of_5_years_together_for_9/). Comments made me think that I had exaggerated, until a series of things triggered me to plan to leave (as 90% of comments told me to). When I told him I wasn't scared of divorce and that it had crossed my mind he freaked out, and in 2 hours came back to me that he was going to fight for us, and that we can be better. He has been better, but I  can't seem to shake my hesitation.",

            "This is unfortunately really common in unhealthy relationships. Check the cycle of abuse or narcissistic behaviour pattern, and they all have a \"honeymoon stage\" they hit just after they think they've pushed things too far and want to reel you back in. How long it'll take to finish and roll around to the bad stage again will depend on how badly you scared him. If very thoroughly, he will wait until something changes which will make it harder for you to leave. There is a reason most people who have experienced abuse say the first time it became overt was just after they'd moved in together/got engaged/shared a financial commitment/similar.\n\nAre you on birth control? Make sure it is one he can't tamper with. \n\nOr, if he thinks you're bluffing, tensions will slowly start to rise until he has an outburst again.\n\nDo you really want to spend the rest of your life with someone where unless they think you're on the verge of leaving treats you and the kids like shit?",
            "OP, You mentioned the \"grass is not greener on the other side\"; however, you also don't need to just divorce and get married again. This guy is a schmuck and you know it. \n\nThe grass COULD be greener if you shared responsibility and time with the kids and he was forced to through court and provide child support and you got some sense of freedom and life back instead of being a 1950s housewife. \n\nThe comments here have a pretty good sense of what's going on. Your hesitation and skepticism is warranted. Divorce doesn't need to be a bad thing but rather could be something to celebrate. Get some freedom and spontaneity into your life. Kids will be fine as well, you're obviously a very capable mother. Do you girl.",
            "I think you should Google the term \"love bombing\". It sounds like he has realized that he's pushed you too far, so he's trying to win you back by being extra \"good\". Eventually he will start to feel complacent and will likely go back to his old ways.\n\nNormally I would recommend marriage counseling, however if you truly believe he is a narcissist then it probably wouldn't be a good idea. He will just use therapy to manipulate you in new ways.",
            "Whether you decide to leave or stay, it won't do any harm to be financially independent and informed of your options. Better to be prepared and not use the information than to leave in a panic.\n\nAlso, it sounds like you two haven't really started to talk about the big issues, which should perhaps be done in couples councilling. Him making changes is good, but like your gut says - you're not convinced they're genuine changes.",
            "Love bombing or not, is his current level of trying enough for you? Like, is celebrating anniversaries with last-minute cards and flowers, listening to your ideas sometimes, and other behavior what you want for 30 years? \n\nOnly you can answer that for yourself.",
            "I really hate to tell you this, but his sweetness will last for a week or two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a narcissist mother, and after a huge fight she would swear everything will be better and we should treat eachother nicer. It always lasted a day or two weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's not going to change. I'm so sorry.",
            "The thing about love bombing, is that it can only last for so long.  It reminds me of any big lifestyle change such as working out.  The reason why people tend to do really well for a short while and then fall off over time is because motivation itself isn't good enough to keep the behavior going.  That is why you see people crowding gyms in January to only see the gyms empty by March. \n\nYour husband right now is worried that you might leave him because you are on to him, so he is giving you this entire new act so that you don't want to leave.  He has a pretty sweet deal having you to care for him and your kids, so he doesn't want to mess this up. Understandably so. You make his life easy. But just like any other drastic change in life, his motivation will eventually die out, and he will return back to normal.  \n\nSo I wouldn't get your hopes up.  Stay skeptical.  If he isn't doing the work it takes to repair a marriage in a genuine way (not just being nice to you), then this doesn't seem to be sincere.

I am sure that this is not the first time you've been caught in a cycle of your husband wooing you back into his good graces, only to slide back into his rotten, nasty behavior. The only advice I can really offer here is to find a way out, because there's no winning with a narcissist. Your self-worth will continue to suffer in this relationship, and it's going to traumatize the heck out of your kids, more than it probably already has. \n\nI'd suggest looking up someone like Dr. Ramani Durvasala on YouTube for resources on narcissism and how these relationships play out for more information. I'd also suggest seeking out a therapist, if you don't have one already, ASAP, as recovering from a narcissistic relationship is going to take a lot of time, unpacking, and processing.

It always has your best interest in mind\"\n\nYOU are in the best position to determine who this person you married truly is.

It's not worth sticking around to find out one way or another. Even if you married them, even if you share children, as crazy as that may sound. \n\nI knew. I knew EARLY. Before we lived together, before we got married, hell before we even met in person.

Maybe I'M the narcissist and I'm just projecting!* \n\nI moved halfway across the country with my daughter to be with him. I forgot all about narcissim and forgot I even went down that rabbit hole in the first place- it was totally off my radar. \n\nThen he started being abusive in ways I couldn't ignore. Emotional and ambient abuse became verbal and unmistakable.\n\n Then he started shoving me, tripping me, getting in my face and screaming. \n\nThen he backhanded me. Hard enough to make my nose bleed. \n\nThen he punched me, and kept punching me- in the face, my skull, my arm that I used to shield my head while I somehow managed to use my other hand to send my friend the Facebook message that probably saved my life \n\nHe was choking me to the point my vision was going black when the cops showed up.

It's the same with women who have done heinious things to their husbands.\n\nJust don't forget that the majority of us men (and women!) are totally decent and don't let bad experiences tarnish your whole opinion of the opposite sex, I have not.\n\nEnd of the day, a lot of us invite drama into our life without realising it and it sucks, but don't tarnish all men with the same brush, generally people are prettty decent.\n\nThat's just my two cents, Destan.",

            "Sounds like my relationship. I mean my husband definitely seems like a narcissist. Everything is about him. He is the type that will never, and never has asked about my dreams. And only encourages me to do things that he idealized and felt worked for him. When we were younger and I wanted to pursue a nursing career - he literally said \u201cgross no. I would never date you if you were a nurse. It grosses me out!\u201d Of course he backpedaled a bit and tried to put a positive spin on things and encouraging in my current design career. Because it suited his ideal - whatever that was. But had I understood what that interaction was, what it revealed to me, I would certainly have saved myself years of heartbreak. We have two beautiful kids and that\u2019s the only thing worth taking from this relationship.\n\nYou sound like you probably have some determination and drive left in you to live your life. If any part of you doubts what the truth of your relationship, then you know what you should do. Don\u2019t let him charm you back into wasting anymore years. You\u2019ve got one life!",

            "Jesus christ the marriages people get themselves into. Like you had kids with this guy? Who marries for a second time at 22. Like even if you have nothing and no one and no education how is renting a room while working min wage worse and harder than marrying and breeding with a narcissist. Girl leave. Like. Im glad your smartening up... its at glacial pace but at least its happening. Plus dont you get like alimony and child support? How is being alone worse than being with this guy. You need to learn serious boundaries and self worth. Leave and then take great care about who you let in your life. You attracted a narcissist once unless you work on yourself you'll attract another. Good luck. The parenting via shaming nip that in the bud aggressively. Being an adult with shame problems is the gateway to a life riddled with mental illness. Also tell your kid that when dad does that its cause hes deranged and fucked and to not listen to him at all. Parents who parent with shame are emotional black holes with no other tools in their parenting tool box. Careful your most sensitive one will get the brunt of it. Make sure they know they're not a POS.",

Specifically r/justnoso but r/justnomil is busier and gives insight into badly behaved spouses as well as their mothers. \n\nI\u2019m the daughter of a narcissist father who\u2019s mother was always too afraid to leave. They\u2019re in their 60\u2019s now and I\u2019ve had to move back with them due to my health. It\u2019s mums biggest regret in life, staying. \n\nThe physical abuse was directed at me growing up. So maybe consider that aspect when you\u2019re weighing up your options, you will not always be his only victim and they tailor their abuse to each person.",

I also find it frightening  how seriously people take this advice on board. Who are those commenters ?  Maybe they are barely 17 and dont know a thing about adult  long term relationships? Maybe they are people who themselves are serial losers and have multiple unresolved psychological  issues ? \n\nYou are hurting, you feel taken for granted,  you feel that your happiness depends on your husbands appreciation. In the past he filled your empty cracks and you , as a person, felt complete. The trick is that YOU  is in charge of your own happiness, you have to complete yourself,  you fulfill yourself firstly and then you share.\n\nIt's a little bit immature to ask your husband to be responsible for your personal growth and completeness. You are an adult now.",
            "Work on your marriage, you have kids. He is not perfect but he is not abusive and your life is not in danger. If he loves you, these problems can be fixed; counseling is a great place to begin. \n\nCommunicate with him (not through arguing) where you have issues in the relationship and what you want; where he is failing and how he\u2019ll need to compromise to find a middle ground.",

            "Okay let's think logically for a second. Literally everyone is speaking negatively of your husband based on only two posts. But in reality, none of us know him at all like you do. If he's genuinely trying and changing, that's at least a step in the right direction. I say wait it out and see if this continues or if he continues to treat you the way you deserve to be treated. But if he doesn't, and he does revert back to his old ways I would consider divorce. The only reason I'm saying that you should wait this out and keep giving it a chance is for your children.",
            "We're only seeing this over the internet and so none of us can say for sure that he is something as extreme as an actual narcissist or that he is lovebombing you as others have suggested. But if he wants to really make long term changes, you guys should really do some couples counseling and he needs to step up to the plate and do some counseling on his own. Even if it's not as severe as narcissism, these kinds of changes in behavior don't happen overnight and there are times when it will falter.",

What about sticking it out with your husband while following a strict code rules of an affair. Just food for thought. Please just check out this subreddit r/adultery. Just go in with an open mind. I know plenty of users will see my comment as taboo but some people are happily in an affair while still keeping keeping their family together. I hope you will find your happiness.

            "Again people are being way too hypervigilent on situations that are completely normal and very common. Your husband may take you for granted but that doesn\u2019t make him an narcissist. I\u2019ve dated a narcissist and using labels like this just devalues real abuse victims. \n\nThis situation is just what happens sometimes when you\u2019re in a relationship for 9 years and complacency sets in.  Counseling is needed for this one because expectations have to be reset to get things back on track.",

I don\u2019t understand why he has to repay you. He\u2019s flawed.  Maybe deeply flawed.  Aren\u2019t we all.  But I think he\u2019s trying. I would look for happiness outside of him appreciating and being grateful for all you do. Spend less time doing housework perfectly and planning elaborate dinner parties for his mom and dad and pick up a fulfilling and interesting hobby.

            "I always recommend couples therapy and doing EVERYTHING possible to save the family before making any decisions on the divorce. Even if you end up taking the divorce route - it will be easier because you both will know that you truly tried your best to save the family. And then there's also a chance you find a way to reconnect and you both will learn to appreciate each other. Family is worth fighting for and divorce is extra hard on the kids  (speaking from personal experience as a single mom of 2 for the past 4 years)",
            "Wow. I'm not going to propose to know whats actually going on in your relationship. Maybe he's a shit and you should leave him. But I can tell you I don't see you taking any ownership over issues that might be between you and your partner. My honest perception is that your not actually engaging with him and instead cultivating a position for yourself of how you have been wronged based on things you think he \"should know\" to do. It's also obvious to me that you don't actually see him as an equal and rather someone that should be managed to fit the way you want him to. I also think you're creating a dishonest, destructive game by not having more thorough communication with him. I think deep down your actually trying to make things worse (without knowing it) in order to validate what you think is going to make it better. And I think you are setting yourself up for both you and he to lose in the short and long run. \n\nBut fuck me, it's your show. I don't really care, I'm just not going to deny what may be a truer true or sugar coat it for you. I could be 100% wrong and he could be a shit.

We are just infatuated, or in love of the idea of love. Wou cannot rationalize how come some can get married, and commit their life to someone, and then get divorced later on in life. How can someone. Feel so sure, so strongly about someone, only to leave them.",
