He was really chill and empathetic about it. He invited me out to drinks later that week and since, well, everything was already known it was actually pretty easy to talk to him about it, and we laughed it off. I let him know I was still into him but wanted to give him space and also didn't want to complicate our friendship. He was very kind and affirming about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater that night, he asked if I wanted to kiss and I say said hell yes, so we made out a bit - it was amazing. We made plans to hang out later that week and one thing led to another and we did the monster mash. It was a graveyard smash. :) Our friendship seems to have deepened a bit as a result and I'm super happy with the FWB arrangement. I'm doubtful that the future will hold any further romance between us other than physical, but honestly I'm pretty happy with it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister and I also talked it out and everything is good between us now - she apologized, agreed to start therapy (recognizing the pattern of her going after people I like) and has been checking in with me to make sure I'm okay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Everything is cool, I'm banging my hot crush, we're still friends, my sister and I are cool, communication wins.",

            "Glad things worked out for you. You mentioned he's your crush but now you're in a FWB arrangement while he's on rebound, just be sure you stay clear-headed about the FWB fact and keep your crushy feelings in check if he ultimately doesn't plan pursuing an emotionally invested relationship with you.",
            "Could be off base on this, but it sounds like you set your sights on someone and then settle for less than what you want. You said in your last post your sister ended up entangled with guys you expressed interest in - and I know that feeling and it does suck - but from what little I know here it also seems like you don\u2019t go just go after what you want. If this FWB situation is what you really want and I kinda doubt it, then way to go, could be very fun. But maybe just maybe take your overstepping siblings moves as a kick in the ass and go for what you really want. ",
            "Am I the only one who doesn\u2019t see this as a happy ending??",
            "Well looks like your update post got 10x the upvotes\nBut it\u2019s also worrying considering your FWB arrangement is built on a rebound",
            "Not to be a Debbie downer, but when I started having sex with my bff, it sent everything to absolute shit.\n\nWe stopped taking for a few months and then started hanging again. Almost instantly, we started fooling around again, and I told him it would just complicate everything like before, but he swore up and down it wouldn't. \n\nLong story short, it totally did. We are no longer on speaking terms, and I lost someone who was very important to me. The damage becomes irreparable, and you know you're not going to be happy about your future place in his life when he leaves you to be in an actual relationship later on.\n\nSave yourself the heartache. You know deep down that this arrangement isn't what you want. And you deserve to be with someone who wants all of you.",
            "I still think what your sister did is super shitty, and I don\u2019t think it should be so easily forgotten, especially because it\u2019s a pattern of behaviour. She needs to grow up honestly. I feel like you\u2019re settling for less with this guy because you thought things were ruined by your sister and then when he wanted FWB you were like: \u201cthank god, yep that\u2019ll do\u201d. You deserve someone who reciprocates your feelings properly ",
            "Damn, OP. You\u2019re setting yourself up for disappointment here. FWB with somebody you want to be with is never a good idea. One person has, or catches feelings and winds up getting hurt. I hope things work out for you. I just feel like you\u2019re playing with fire. ",
            "Just be careful of getting used. I know you said he was kind about the whole thing but it sounds like he found out that you\u2019re into him and even though he doesn\u2019t want to date you, he still just wants to hook up tho. I can see how this is a win win for him, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard to see clearly with your feelings maybe clouding your judgment, but just be careful he doesn\u2019t get an upper hand in this new relationship. Have a clear talk about any ground rules or boundaries. ",
            "Careful with that arrangement. I've rarely heard of feelings not being hurt once it gets to the point of stopping that kind of relationship",
            "I missed your OP or I would have commented. When I read \"this isn't the first time she's done this, her last 2 relationships were people I crushed on, but says she doesn't remember.\" I actually said \"for fucks sake\" out loud.  \n\nI'm really glad your feelings have been vindicated, but I'd look for actions not words from your sister in the future.",

Saying she will do therapy is not the same as actually being someone you can trust, and she's shown herself to be someone you can't trust. ",
            "Can\u2019t lie. This worries me a bit. Please, please protect your heart. I\u2019m just really wary of this kind of arrangement. \n\nSomeone always gets hurt. I worry that you\u2019re settling for whatever you can get, (while secretly hoping for more) rather than face the possibility of \u201cpushing him away\u201d with what you *really* want. Just be careful, ok?\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I hope this works out. Take care!",
            "Happy for you at the moment for having the courage to go through with all this. To be honest I'm frankly just scared of how this will all turn out. You're now walking in an FWB tightrope while balancing being his rebound on one hand and having emotions for him on the other.\n\nBe constantly aware of your arrangement and guard your emotions, otherwise you are setting yourself up for pain.",
            "OP glad you're happy now, but reading just this post, sounds like you're doing intimate things with a guy who approached you knowing you liked him, but also knowing he (at best) wasn't ready for a relationship yet or (at worst) knows he doesn't want a relationship with you (yet, or ever). Without knowing much else it kinda sounds like he could be taking advantage of the situation, especially when you sound more than willing to give him space and to let him have his cake and eat it in the hopes that things may work out further down the line.\n\nJust be careful. Be sure to have that awkward conversation in a few weeks where you make sure you all are on the same page about where this is going. Because I wouldn't be surprised if you both have different ideas above what's likely to happen next. ",

            "Love how OP is only responding to simple comments that just say they\u2019re happy for her. She must not like all the comments telling her to be careful about a FWB situation. Let the downvotes commence. But people like to ask for advice and then ignore the overwhelming majority that caution them or tell them anything other then exactly what they want to hear",
            "As long as you\u2019re not harbouring thoughts of this maybe turning into something else? It seems like you know this in your head (that\u2019s it\u2019s unlikely to go anywhere) but you still seem hopeful it might? If that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing, look after your feelings OP.\n\nSometimes these things can work out but starting out the way this all did (when he knew you\u2019d at least be down for something) is a potential mine field. \n\nIf you know this is just good sex though, then get it and sex on! ",
            "I\u2018d nevertheless move out soon away from your sister. The power-imbalance she creates and enjoys surely are very unhealthy for you. Does she do this in other parts of your shared life as well? ",
            "Ah... So it's a friends with benefits thing... Could be good, could be bad.\n\nJust keep your feelings out of this current arrangement or it could get ugly.",
            "Just make sure FWB isn't you settling....FWB work for people that are not romantically interested in the other person. If you have a crush on him, I'm not entirely sure FWB will work out in the long run for you because it becomes hard when you also really like them and want to date them. It might work for a while but what happens when he meets someone he DOES want to date? Or goes on other dates? Or talks to you, as one does with FWB, about them? Because FWB means you are still friends, and you sometimes do the dirty, but you're more friends than anything - which means he will tell you about this stuff, maybe even ask your opinion on a girl he likes? If you even get a stirring of jealous feelings, or possessiveness, STOP doing FWB.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan you handle that? Seriously, think about it. If you still think you can, and you're not just saying that so you get SOMETHING you want even if it's not EVERYTHING(as in you tell yourself at least you get the sex even if you don't get the relationship). FWB is hard, and not all people are capable of doing this. You have to be able to let go of the sex immediately if needed or requested, with no hard feelings. If he walks up to you and says \"I met this amazing girl last night, and we have a date tomorrow - I really like this girl and don't want to mess it up, so we can't have sex anymore.\" are you going to be able to high-five him and say \"No problem, of course! I'm so happy for you!\"? If not, don't be a FWB. Just don't. It will end with hard, bitter feelings on your part. It won't be forever - FWB is never forever. You may be thinking FWB might lead to a relationship but that doesn't usually happen.",

With how flirty your sister is he\u2019s probably hoping to get you and the sister in bed. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they haven\u2019t already smashed too. \n\nBut if you ok with just having sex with a hot guy then that\u2019s really not a problem at all.

I\u2019m fine as I already have some experience with them going crazy lol. My poor brother, on the other hand, was completely blindsided but we talked and I helped him set up some security devices/tips to avoid our parents.\n\nThis did made things take a weird twist and now the whole family is convinced I somehow turned my brother gay(which, ignoring the glaring HOW, is the why I\u2019d do this) and I\u2019m the bad influence. Nothing like waking up to your mom blowing your phone saying you\u2019re going to hell eh?\n\nMy brother is pretty shocked and confused. This, at least, gave me the opportunity(after a couple of beers) to talk with him about our family, how I was treated and so. He was pretty heart broken and feeling guilty but I did my best to show him it wasn\u2019t his fault.\n\nI think this conversation really made us closer and made me feel more at ease with the situation. A week or so later he asked if I was alright(I tend to freeze when I\u2019m awkward) and I explained I was a bit intimidated by awesome-ness(not like this lol). He was actually very understanding and said he knew exactly how I felt. Then he started talking a bit about his fuck ups and how he screwed things up.\n\nThis helped a lot to take him off the pedestal I had put him in. Right now our relationship is great, I regularly have dinner with them, they met my friends and we\u2019re both supportive of each other situation with our family. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to return contact with them, at least until they truly apologize, stop blaming me and accept his husband.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m still not sure of what the future holds, I\u2019m still awkward and kinda flopping around life trying to do things but I\u2019m not so insecure and now I know I have my brother to help me out.\n\nThanks for all the advices guys!\n\nTL;DR: my family got even crazier but at least this made my brother and I closer.

His brother had never accepted him as a gay man since he was previously married and has two kids. The brother was worried about the kids. Especially the daughter. They have grown up with lots of love and caring from myself and grandma. So my point is that maybe one day your parents will see that they were wrong and will accept your brother as a gay man.

Hes so crazy smart and it makes it hard for me to socialize with him because of how self conscious it makes me. I know I can keep up but it is intimidating. Over the last few years we've been really close, we talk pretty often even though he did move away\n\nOne thing I found was that with him a lot of times I dont have to force myself to conversation and hes one of the few people I can enjoy silence with, we never have to say a lot to know what the other is thinking. \n\nCongrats again and enjoy having a relationship you can grow and build on with your brother!

We both work full time, and we have dates and time together. In many ways I'm satisfied. But at the core, my husband and I are different people. He is not passionate and not interested in the same things I am for the most part. I also have little interest in his hobbies. So we both have inner lives that are separate from the other. \n\nI'll make up stories to get myself through the day. Like I'll see a stranger at the library and I imagine a meeting of the minds relationship with this complete stranger. Or I'll leave home at night and go for drives and listen to romantic songs and put myself in the lyrics. I thumb through travel websites and imagine entire lives in those places. My therapist has been gently telling me that this might be unhealthy behavior, and that I should give more thought to being present in the world. Anyone else dealing with a similar dilemma? Any advice? \n\n---\n**tl;dr**: Married woman with stable married life, no real issues except imagination.",

            "Has your therapist mentioned, or have you yourself looked into Maladaptive Daydreaming?",
            "I think you should probably focus on what your therapist says. Seeking outside opinion on a topic that you're covering in therapy with a professional is rarely going to be helpful in the long run. We don't know you, we don't know the extent of this behavior, we aren't trained in dealing with this kind of thing.\n\nStick to what your therapist says. The fact that you came to strangers on the internet for a second opinion is a pretty good indication that this is in fact an issue.",
            "I would ask yourself how much time you spend fantasizing, in a given day. Is it every day? Is it several hours a day?\n\nI would also ask yourself if this fantasizing is stopping you from doing things that could make your actual lived experience better. If you took the time and energy you spend fantasizing and invested it in other ways, what could you get? Could you get a deeper relationship with your husband? Could you gain more satisfaction from pursuing another hobby with that time? \n\nEveryone fantasizes some. I have done it more in times of my life where I was mostly unhappy. I did a lot of fantasizing in high school, which was a time where I felt really disconnected from other people. I fantasized A LOT about having romance in my life. In college I fantasized about living a totally different lifestyle and having comforts that I didn't have, and not having the stressors of hard schoolwork. These days I don't spend much time fantasizing about a different life because I'm happier in the life I am in. (Also I am in treatment for my anxiety and depression now, so my mental health is better.) Maybe your experience is different and it's not something you do just because you're unhappy. But for me, I feel like it's something that doesn't really give satisfaction, and it can distract you from actually *doing something* to change the circumstances that make you unhappy. \n\nYour therapist probably has a good reason for giving this advice, but she also isn't inside your head. This comment is just all my perspective and stuff to think about. There is nothing inherently wrong with having a rich fantasy life, and it doesn't have to be taking away from your real life.",
            "In my opinion, it sounds like you're escaping into your fantasies so you can avoid confronting the uncomfortable reality in your life: you aren't satisfied in your marriage. Your fantasies seem to revolve around an idealized version of romance. Meanwhile you say you have little in common with your husband, that your sex life is lacking, that you can't have fun and adventure while having a stable life and child (not true btw), and that your therapist \"doesn't understand\" that you \"don't have control\" over these things. \n\nYour therapist understands exactly how much control you have: control over your own actions, and no one else's. And with this control over your own actions, instead of confronting these issues head-on, it seems like you're avoiding them completely because you get just enough satisfaction out of your fantasies to not completely lose your mind. Have you actually spoken to your husband about your relationship? How does he feel about your sex life? How has your relationship changed since your child was born--and how does that make you feel?\n\nInstead of daydreaming about these escapist fantasies, why don't you try putting some of that brainpower to work thinking about how you can move forward in your relationship with your husband? Imagine what you might say to him and how he might react. Use it to prepare you for actually talking to him for real. If you don't address these problems they aren't going to go away. This is your one and only life, you deserve to feel happy and loved. Don't waste your time escaping the real world when you could be spending that time making it better.",
            "This might be unhealthy because it is keeping you from actually feeling your dissatisfaction with your life and acting on it. \n\nInstead of daydreaming about a stranger, what about planning a romantic date with your husband? Instead of daydreaming about a life abroad, what about making a plan and s budget to visit somewhere? \n\nEveryone does the things you are doing. But if you do them too much, you're blocking your own way.",
            "Others have mentioned maladaptive daydreaming, and the part that many people don't get, is the 'maladaptive' part. A lot of people have coped with uncomfortable situations, or just plain boredom by creating a richer fantasy life. It's difficult to figure out when it becomes harmful but your therapist is likely correct that you might not be as emotionally available to others in your life because you're too focused on the fantasy life. It's also easy to start relying on it and ultimately finding your real life disappointing. BUt no real life can live up to our fantasies.",
            "I did that when I was younger, always making up scenarios where I was desired and loved. Turns out I just really wanted to be desired and loved. \nI agree with your therapist, because going too deep in those fantasies as your only coping mechanism doesn\u2019t do you any good. Instead of working on real life solutions to make you happier you remain in the status quo and just check out. The fantasies are just s quick fix and won\u2019t help you on the long run.",
            "I do the same thing with my wife, though mostly just in the hobbies and future plans. We've recently started couples therapy and her individual therapy because at the heart of things, she's just extremely unhappy and has no interests or direction anymore. \n\nI don't know if your husband has a similar problem, but me withholding the things I think about and hope and dream and want to do/achieve only made things worse. You maybe don't have to tell him everything, but it might be a good idea to share the things he could possibly be a part of, like the travel plans or romantic thoughts, etc.",

All while working and paying bills and being a responsible adult. But when I left him and moved back home all that changed and now I do not need it.\n\nThink about changing your situation.",
            "It seems your therapist gave you the best advice, which they studied to understand and you paid for. Seeking answers on social media for a mental health issue that you've been told to address by a professional is very indicative of how unhealthy this habit has gotten, as you're now seeking guidance from the blind to ignore what's been brought to light. You even said your therapist was gentle about it. Listen to them.",
            "What, specifically, has your therapist identified that makes it unhealthy?\n\n\nIn other words, in what way does this rich inner life negatively affect your \"real life\"?\n\n\nIf your therapist is calling this unhealthy behavior, the onus is on your therapist to be clear and specific about WHY it's unhealthy. If they haven't done that, you should press them to do so.",

            "Yeah, I do this too. Not so much anymore but I used to do it quite a lot. I've always just had a very noisy brain. I'm not always part of the scenarios in my head but I find that the themes are often similar. Like the person or me is displaying some sort of power in the daydream. Maybe for you, it seems like love is the thing you focus on. \n\nI think the thing that strikes me is that you daydream to get through the day. I typically daydream for fun. It seems like this might be that you feel unloved/unhappy and are making up these scenarios to try and create that within yourself.",
            "I guess my only question would be: if you had the chance to act on one of those things, would you take it if it meant no longer having what / who you have right now?\n\nEx:\n\n- moving to the new place, imagine you\u2019ve got the money to move no barriers BUT you don\u2019t get to take your family with you. Would you still do it?\n\n- starting a friendship with the person at the library, but your partner was against it. Would you still want to follow through?\n\n\nYour therapist *might* be trying to say look, it seems like there\u2019s things you wish you could do BUT are held back from them... are the reasons your held back valid? Or can you start doing some of the things you dream about (or planning them so you can do them). Cause if you really dream about wanting to do different things, you could ask yourself: what are the healthy things you can implement and then what are the unhealthy or unattainable things that you can keep fantasy?",

Well you have to still get groceries. And clean that villa. And where will you get money to pay for that villa. Where does your kid fit in here. Etc. I know you don\u2019t have that dream necessarily but for example. \n\nYou can still fantasize of course but eventually you can hopefully reach a spot where it\u2019s not consuming your normal life to the point where it makes you depressed.",
            "This sounds like maladaptive daydreaming, there is actually a subreddit for this! I used to do this a lot at home myself, I think part of it was a lack of stimulation in both my media consumption and general life.  I also find that when an area of my life isn't satisfying (romantic or otherwise) that \"tone\" or \"subject\" will be explored more. Boredom led to adventures, lack of emotional engagement meant elaborate evocative stories, frustration at my favorite subjects being missing from media meant replacinf nedia I've watched mentally with the additions I wanted to see.  This also kept me from taking action or exposing myself to the discomfort of change.\n\n\n\n\nSo, you mention your husband and you dont have a lot in common? Maybe instead of compartmentalizing and tolerating the status quo, being present and addressing this would be more helpful...? Just an idea.",

It\u2019s usually triggered by music or a repetitive act like walking to your school or house.\n\nIt\u2019s a coping mechanism, meaning something is bothering you about life. For me I was married to an extremely abusive sociopathic loser. I had no hope in life while married to him. I used to daydream while going to to work and coming home. Your not crazy because you know it\u2019s not true. However, you don\u2019t pay attention to your life. It\u2019s a huge waste of time.  \n\nHow I got out of it was I got divorced. Now I kinda sat down and said if everything went right what would I have? Ok now is this still attainable? How can I do it and how long will it take. Then instead of day dreaming I would think about how what I needed to do, to get to my goals. \n\nEx, I wanted to be organized I started with making my bed every day. On the way home instead of day dreaming I would think about I have an hour maybe I can clean my microwave or fridge or buy some groceries. \n\nIn your daydreams, you maybe thinking about some prince saving you from an evil queen. Your looking for romance. Why not try to have a nice night with the husband? Make a nice dinner and watch a movie at home if you can\u2019t afford a sitter? \n\nThe trick is to think about something that is attainable and work towards that",
            "Listen to the professional who knows you. You sound terribly passive and insistent on pretending you cannot do things about real life issues.

Others do the same but it is games, books, art, thwn there a travels, hobbies etc.\n\nAre there specifics of what you fantasize?  Answering it might help understand what is this lack in life. Also, if your life is quite boring like routine home work home. Try something new, like talk with a real peraon ib the library?\n\nI don't think it's bad. But if it's too much of it then it definetely means you are trying to fix something with such day dreaming. \n\nBe open with your therapist and help her to help you.",

            "I definitely relate. When I was younger, I would be incredibly detached from the real world, and would rather sit somewhere and write or sketch while imagining my adventures with non-existent people in a fantastical world, or even have conversations in my head with imaginary friends, than interact with my peers. I had major social issues. I only managed to get it fixed by pushing myself to take interest in people, form friendships, be open to different world views, etc. It sounds small, but there's a difference between apathetic acknowledgement and *interest*.\n\nNow, I feel like I lost a bit of myself. My fantastical and creative edge. But the real world isn't so bad, and I don't miss maladaptive daydreaming. I miss my creativity, but it also doesn't get in the way of my life as much as it used to.\n\nPut your hobbies aside for a moment during the day, and try to live like your husband. Like your peers.

I get a lot of satisfaction in my real life, and for me, the fantasies are a creative outlet. I tell my partner about them, we laugh about it and, he suggests story ideas.

It doesn't have to be for very long, maybe a few days, maybe a week, if you can get someone to look after your child. I think you and your husband should go just the two of you. I think you need to spend some time with him and discover and explore something new, together. This might invigorate the both of you and satisfy your imagination a bit. This won't be a quick fix but I think this will help quite a bit. And if you still feel like you need to escape, might I suggest you talk to your therapist a little more and possibly consider couples therapy. But before the couples therapy, talk to your husband first. Ask him (if you haven't) what he thinks about it. You never know, maybe you'll learn something new about him and find an answer that way.

After all hearing how someone\u2019s day went, is much more interesting if their day was different from yours. \nI\u2019m sure that in the beginning of your relationships you might\u2019ve had more things in common, maybe similar interests, mutual friends, maybe you guys went to the same school, but you are here and right now and admiring your growth and the way you\u2019ve come is marvelous.\nI hope all works out for you",

She said her family and I didn\u2019t get along, but when I finally took all my things, her mom and I hugged and cried while telling me I\u2019m family, always welcome, no one understands what happened, and the whole family is hurting - it helped me understand that I wasn\u2019t the only one feeling confused, hurt, and lied to.

I watched him unravel in what appeared to be a mental health breakdown and noticed how out of touch with reality he seemed. It made me wonder about myself. I stopped writing fantasy cold turkey. It was really difficult because during my down time I couldn't just run story lines in my head. I still had the ideas but they became tainted and made me sad. I struggled for probably a year and felt aimless and uncreative. However, I decided to start focusing on real-life and writing what I remembered about my past and kind of created a little whimsical twist to it.

Have you expressed to your husband wanting to share a hobby or an activity to increase your bond? Thought about couples counseling or other ways to communicate and share more.

            "I relived heavily on maladaptive daydreaming to get me through my childhood and adolescence and I think the important thing to note is that having a rich imagination isn't the issue, it's how you can use it to divert mindfulness\n\nAs an adult I struggle a lot with my mental health and a lot of it comes from me never learning how to practice mindfulness; some of this comes from my neurodevelopment, like I have conditions that make it hard to sense what's happening in my body, conditions that make it hard to recognize what I'm feeling, conditions that make it hard to focus and have awareness. These things on their own aren't issues but in practice I tend to neglect my needs and become dysfunctional in my efforts to manage my life and regulate my emotions\n\nHaving an imagination like ours is a gift and being able to distract ourselves from the discomfort of our lives is a valuable skill, but like all coping mechanisms they can sometimes become unsustainable. It's like a tent you set up in your front yard because there was a fire in your house. You can live there for a bit and it might even be fun for a spell, but at some point you have to fix your house before a storm comes along and knocks your tent down around you",

Since I couldn't control them like my daydreams it was giving me signals that something was wrong. \n\nI think your therapist may be right and you may have some reflecting to do. Do you feel stuck?

            "It kind of depends - does daydreaming like that make you less satisfied or happy with your real life? If yes, then it could be good to not daydream like that for a while and see if your satisfaction with real life increases, or if it changes your behavior and habits in real life (ie you feel more engaged so you do more things and therefore feel more fulfilled, etc).  \n\n\nYour therapist is probably encouraging you to be more present in your daily life because some of the current research about fulfillment and happiness (and actually brain health too) emphasizes being present in each moment as one of the best ways to feeling fulfilled and happy. There's also research on daydreams as being counterproductive to meeting real life goals (because you get the same satisfaction from a daydream as you do from meeting a goal, which can deplete your drive to complete goals). If you just use daydreaming as a way of entertaining yourself and passing time, then it's probably harmless though.   \n\n\nYou can try cutting back on the daydreams and being more present. Another thing you could do is just ask your therapist why they think your habits are unhealthy and in what ways they're harming you, and just ask for a really clear breakdown of your therapist's thought process. Remember you don't have to stick with a therapist if they're not doing you any good, but also your therapist has a differently informed perspective and may be seeing things about you and your situation that you don't fully see yourself.",
            "OP, I don't have much advice to give but I just wanted to say that I seriously thought I was alone in this kind of situation. I have very intense elaborate fantasies and have imaginary worlds to escape. After growing up as a disabled only child in a neighborhood with no other kids, imagination helped me feel less lonely and pass the time. As I got older the daydreaming would become disruptive and caused me to get into a fender bender that was was my fault. I set many relationship on this pedestal and they failed because they didn't match my fantasies. According to the other comments, this could be maladaptive daydreaming. The daydreams come and go at this point. \n\nI think daydreams are overall okay but I think it's important to asses the root of them. A recurring daydream I have is being in love in a same sex relationship yet I am very much in live with my opposite sex partner of 4 years. I reflected on this for a long time and realized I'm probably bisexual. I still daydream about that fantasy and told my partner about the fantasy. It helped our relationship grow which made me fall for him even more. \n\nAnother fantasy is having superpowers. I believe this stems from me feeling ashamed of my disability and wishing I had super abilities instead. I could go on.",

Maybe, you'll be unhappy returning to real life. I don't see it that way, I enjoy living in my head and taking a break from real life. Anything is possible and you can go anywhere your imagination takes you. Some people do not have such vivid imaginations and might think those that do are not alright.

I like using guided meditation apps. If you don\u2019t like meditating or just can\u2019t, you can try just slowly practising being in the present again. For small steps my therapist suggested I pay attention to the mundane activities like driving to work or brushing my teeth and just pay attention during those times. It might help to like narrate in your head what you are doing (eg. \u201cI\u2019m moving my tooth brush left and right\u201d).",

I realized I was daydreaming so much because I was truly, deeply unhappy, so I changed the things I didn't love about my life and now I dont find myself daydreaming (or even actually dreaming) at all really. The downside is I'm a writer too and I've had horrible writers block since becoming happy lol I just can't get to those places as easily.\n\nEdit to say I'm certainly not suggesting you also divorce, just that you maybe look to improve aspects of you life that don't satisfy you. I started traveling more, like I would if I was in a fantasy, I focused on my health, appearance, hobbies, just put more effort into making my life as close to my \"daydreams\" as possible. Maybe it sounds silly but as someone who has fought depression and obsessive daydreaming for years, something clicked and I just started living those dreams out as much as possible",

But a chunk of my free time goes into my fantasy world every day so I don\u2019t feel as much of a need to retreat there during the rest of my day.

            "I don\u2019t see the problem here. You don\u2019t have maladaptive daydreaming as some people with no medical knowledge have suggested. You\u2019re simply imaginative and creative. You do what most imaginative normal people do, you make up stories in your free time, when you listen to music, walk on the street or do something random when other people would either have no interesting thoughts or think about how their day is going. Everyone \u201cdaydreams\u201d. The difference is that when one walks to work they create interesting scenarios in their heads while the other thinks about what they\u2019ll have for lunch.

I still feel the pull to just do nothing but daydream. I was actually going to put some music on now im I'm bed and go for a dream dive, but after this post maybe I won't. \n\nFrom my end, it was an unhealthy coping mechanism so I only have a negative take on the practice, but as its additive, it doesn't surprise me your diving a lot. \n\nIm sure there are people who are happy and healthy that do it too, but everyone I've read about or spoken to that does it, use it as a escape mechanism from real life, and as you are in therapy, is there anything you are trying to escape from? Wish you could change in your life? \n\nWas there an age you can pinpoint when it started and if it relates to anything that happened during that age? \n\nYou do something I used to do, which is insert myself into love songs, maybe you feel you are missing something in your married life, eg romance / desire / feeling desired ect \n\nI didn't feel wanted, desired or loved and due to abuse, had no form of control in that past relationship so In mine I was powerful and it usually revolved about someone desiring me or loving me. \n\nIf you have recurring themes in your daydreams, write them down and talk about it with your therapist, you might find that your subconscious is trying to tell you something",

However, I explained to her that if she needs further treatment we will need to tell them, and she has agreed bc I spent a considerable amount of time explaining that I did not, infact, think that she was a lunatic, and that mental illnesses need to be addressed the same way physical illnesses are, and that I just want her to get better, the same way she does. I talked about the same with my brother, who concurs.\n\nShe has agreed but only after first seeing a psychologist employed by her school (she went to the counselor that day and was advised to do so), whom she will be seeing today. Hopefully things will get better and I'll try my best to help explain her condition to our parents to keep them from doubting her.

            "I also get auditory and tactile hallucinations when I am falling asleep, after nightmares and when waking up. I had a sleep disorder for a while, so it may not even be a mental health problem. Not that it should matter, I'm just saying to bear that in mind as I needed to see a neurologist to get any answers, not a psychiatrist. While the sleep disorder has now gone, I still get the hallucinations and sleep paralysis most days and some of them are brutal. It's unpleasant but it's harmless (for me, anyway - when I wake up yelling I think my dog would disagree)!",
            "Hey, I went through this with my daughter (13) only six months ago. Hallucinations like she described can be caused by everything from untreated thyroid problems, certain illnesses such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, Vitamin D or B12 deficiency, extreme fatigue and stress, or in my daughter's case, stimulant medication (adderral) that was a little too high combined with extreme stress, and of course more serious mental health problems like schizoaffective mood disorders. \n\nA neurologist told me stress-induced hallucinations tend to show up as the day progresses. You don't just wake up to them. Medical or mental illness-related hallucinations will occur at any time of day. Keep in mind that hallucinations aren't the same as psychosis, and if once she's rested & de-stressed and still sees them, but she is otherwise sane, can tell they're hallucinations, not experiencing other symptoms of mental illness, etc., its much more likely there is an underlying medical problem. \n\nI wish I had seen your post yesterday, but hopefully you see my comment here. Her particular description of hallucinations remind me a lot of what was described by someone who had untreated hyperthyroidism and eventually thyroid storms without anyone realizing it. Please make sure she sees a medical doctor, too, for a complete physical with bloodwork.",

I have sleep paralysis on regular occasions and it happens when I fall asleep or when I\u2019m waking up. Basically I hallucinate about whatever horrible thing my mind makes up and at the same time, I can\u2019t move. Figures and demons and blood and gore are incredibly normal. And it feels so, so real. It\u2019s awful and it feels as real as the \u201creal world\u201d. Regular nightmares got nothing on this. \n\nI sleep in total darkness because then I know that whatever I see is not real. You can\u2019t se a face or a shadow if there is no light. It helps a tiny bit. \n\nI have my sleep paralysis because I have narcolepsy, and it\u2019s normal for it to develop during the early teens and it get missed or misdiagnosed, a lot. And I mean A LOT. Might be something to look into? \n\nI hope you can get to the bottom on this so the poor girl can get some sleep.",

I hope she gets better soon!",
            "About seven years ago, I experienced a series of auditory hallucinations. It was horrifying beyond description. I know that it was mental illness related because I had been experiencing several crippling meltdowns. The voice was very specific and I will never forget it. I haven't heart it since then, but it was more real than anything I had experienced and I ended up sleeping on my parents' floor at the age of 17. \n\nI believe your sister. And she will be okay. Even if this isn't temporary, she will be okay. Thank you for taking this seriously. She might be in for a future of difficult mental illness struggles. She's at about the age when most mental illnesses manifest. So stay by her side, and she will get through this. \n\nIn terms of hallucinations....I wouldn't share those explicitly with your parents. Maybe share that she is struggling. But not everybody can handle that. \n\nGodspeed. I'll watch for your next update.",
            "Looking at your original post, I wonder if she's having sleep paralysis episodes. I started having them almost nightly at age 13. They usually happen right when you're falling asleep (which explains why she's seeing them shortly after laying down to sleep). Mine also involved hallucinations where you can look around your room but it's suddenly inhabited with some sort of creature(s). Often times people have the same creature(s) visiting them, hers may just be bloody corpses. I also definitely had a feeling that I was being watched during these episodes. \n\nSleep paralysis is triggered by stress and it sounds like she's super stressed out.",
            "Idk what's been said before but the first question that popped in my mind was did she ever have any violent experience before? Or did the bodies that appear were \"invented\" by her? Could she have seen sth similar (in a movie or in real life) that traumatized her and she doesn't want to talk about it?\n\nYou're doing a great job helping her, good luck for your exams",
            "OP, your sister needs to be seen in an inpatient setting. With the amount of fear you describe, and with the ongoing hallucinations, she is a risk to herself. I think you need to tell your parents so that they can urgently address this.\n\nIn the inpatient setting they can monitor her for safety, appropriately diagnose her, start her on medication if indicated, and monitor her for side effects as medications can take several weeks to reach therapeutic levels. It would also relieve her of the stress she is experiencing in school which is compounding her mental illness.\n\nPlease speak to your parents and convince them to bring her into the ER. With her reluctance to tell an adult it is possible she is minimizing her symptoms and won't receive the help she needs.",
            "I\u2019m happy she\u2019s getting help. From the first post it definitely seemed like between the stress and now sleeping (interesting fact: a person who goes without enough sleep over a period of time can be just as crazy as a person clinically diagnosed as a psycho). \n\nOf course if she calms down from stress and gets rest and it\u2019s still happening it\u2019s for sure something else",
            "I wish her the best, I really do hope the councelling helps.\nIs there a reason she's afraid of telling your parents? A good parent would see this as a cause to worry and seek better care for the child. It's JUST high school, for it to be causing that much stress isn't healthy or normal.",
            "The amount of fear she is experiencing and seeing the same hallucinations on rotation reminds me of when I had my psychotic break. It sounds like a bad thing but basically my stress levels allowed my psychosis to reach a level that it was noticeable. Then I went to my psychiatrist and was put on antipsychotics and my life has improved immensely since then. Your sister is on the right path. Sending good vibes. I hope she finds the right meds for her quickly.",
            "It\u2019s common for a lot of mental illnesses to show up around 20 years old so I wouldn\u2019t rule out some kind of ongoing mental health issue (schizophrenia, etc.) however this does seem at least partially stress induced. And it could be a nasty cycle that this happened once which kept her from sleeping and scared the shit out of her which led to more stress and less sleep which led to more hallucinations. I will say when my cousin was in college he had similar hallucinations where he would be walking down the street and see demons sitting on people. I was very young and didn\u2019t learn about it until years later but he found relief in going to church. I wouldn\u2019t recommend that as treatment. But I do think finding a community (he\u2019s always been a loner) helped him and as far as I know he never had the issues again. And he has 4 kids (including one who is autistic and one who has severe ADHD) so he\u2019s definitely had stress since then. All this to say it could be a very acute issue that can be treated and may never be an issue again but she\u2019s doing the right things by seeking help. And you\u2019re a very good sister for leading her in that direction.",
            "Did anyone mention the possibility of Lyme disease or PANS/PANDAS? In mental health it is important to rule out possible physical causes before making a diagnosis so please make sure she is examined physically so she is not improperly treated with antipsychotics/mood stabilizers at a very young age.",

I'm glad you decided to take action instead of letting it wear off. Even if it was fake, it is important to have a professional's opinion. It could've gotten a lot worse if nothing were to be done.  You are a great sister!",
            "This could be so many things, including schizophrenia but nor matter what she needs to see a professional immediately as it most likely wont go away and nothing anyone on reddit can do to diagnose it so I am glad she is seeing someone. I just hope they arent going to brush this off at the school as nothing as it most definitely is something and something major to treat. The good news is no matter what it is they most likely can help treat it and limit, if not get rid of these hallucinations but the sooner she gets the treatment she needs the better off in the long run she will be.\n\nDont let this go untreated if the school does brush if off, I can tell you love your sister and wants the best for her so it may definitely involve breaking her trust to make her better and you have to be prepared to either let your parents take over care or make her get treatment if she is too scared and doesnt want to. Her health and well being is more important than your relationship no matter how shitty a situation that actually is.\n\nOne question before I go but what country or part of the world are you in?\n\nBest wishes to you and your sister, I hope one day you update us that she is doing great and thriving again!!",
            "You guys are good siblings for giving her the support and reassurance she needs to tackle this. As others have said, it may not be something as 'scary' as a mental illness. My roommate in college had similar experiences when she was falling asleep. \n\nSometimes when the mind is very stressed and sleep-deprived you can have hallucinations during the sleep-inducing phase. It's actually very common, it doesn't mean she is crazy or has a mental disorder, and can be treated either with medication or self-care.\n\nCan you have your sister read this post? The replies here are very reassuring that she is not alone, that what she is experiencing may be very common, and doesn't mean there is anything wrong with her.",

            "Honestly from the comments, it seems like there are a lot of things this could be. I read your first post and my first thought was a sleep disorder or sleep paralysis. I really wish the two of you well, I hope she gets help and stops seeing such scary things!",
            "Kinda late to that party, but I didnt see the original post so I guess I'll have to do with giving my thoughts here. I'd like to start by saying how sorry I am about your sisters current condition, I can tell you first hand what type of hell it is she's going through (although maybe not to that extent).\n\nSo for starters, your sister needs to seek medical care ASAP. These issues have a tendency to grow larger and larger the more you push back seeking professional attention. As for why I think I have a bit of experience in this field is because although not as severe, I did go through something very similar at around the same age myself (12-15). As for my diagnosis, paranoia and sleep depravity were the culprits. Not going to go into too much detail about what I saw, but I will say it involved me hallucinating very vivid silhouettes of human-like beings that would often taunt me much like your sister. Again, not going into detail for personal reasons.\n\nAs for my solution, aside from sleep medication and weekly therapy, I developed a rather unorthodox method to getting rid of the paranoia. Simply put, I'd watch episodes of my favorite cartoon (Amazing world of gumball) before sleeping and would essentially play them on loop in my head to drown out the paranoia until I fell asleep. I can't say it worked 100% of the time but it helped a great deal and had a pretty noticeable success rate.\n\nI don't know if any of this will help your sister's current situation, but if its anything like what I had it may be a good start. God bless. :)",
            "Your original post makes it sound like she has sleep paralysis.\n\nI used to get it when i was younger and had poor sleeping habits (mainly long naps during the day instead of sleeping only at night).  \n\nOftentimes i would get a loud piercing sound in my head.  Sometimes I\u2019d feel like there was a foreign entity in the room.  Both would disappear as soon as I could regain motor function.",
            "I'm so glad she's seeing someone! \n\nThere are several things that can cause psychosis including schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder, bi-polar disorder,  infections especially with high fever, drugs both recreational and medicinal, lack of sleep.  Sleep is interesting because a person with bi-polar disorder may not sleep (as caused by BPD) and may also experiencing psychosis (as caused by BPD)   That is the lack of sleep does not cause the psychosis, the BPD causes both.  \n\nPsychosis = hallucinations (any of the senses - you can have 'smell' hallucinations) and delusions (like religiosity, grandiosity - believing things that just can't be true).   This is very different from psychopathy = a psychopath aka sociopath = no conscience).\n\nIf the cause is a mental health disorder, your sister will need more than a psychologist.  She'll need medications such as anti-psychotics.   Talk therapy does not eliminate psychosis, but it could help her deal with both the psychosis and the trauma of not being able to trust your own mind and the self-stigma of a mental health diagnosis.   She will need to tell her parents!",
            "I still think you should tell your parents.",
            "I agree with the commenter about the hypnagogic hallucinations. I had them when I was very stressed. Always very brutal and scary. They were very distressing. I also had terrible insomnia and hypnic jerks that lasted through the night. In the end my problem had a very simple solution - magnesium. I was sleeping through the night within week after about 18 months of insomnia when I started taking magnesium.  \n\nI hope your sister finds help soon, you are a wonderful sister to take the time to listen to her.",
            "Wow, you handled that so well, and she also did SO well to tell you even though it must be terrifying. \n\nTell her that you're there for her, and she needs to keep telling you stuff, no matter how scary it is. Be an advocate for her and don't let a doctor or psychiatrist brush her off. Tell her you'll be there for her no matter what happens or how long it takes. \n\nPlease get your name on the list of people who can call her and check in frequently. Even when other people are taking over and things seem sorted out, keep checking in on her. \n\nAnd tell her that she was so brave and smart to tell you, and you're so proud of her for asking for help.",

            "I know it sounds weird, but maybe try doing it back to her. I worked with a severe autistic child that would do randomly do boundary related things, like one time he came up to me and blew in my face. He\u2019s never done that before so I did it back to him and he immediately gave me a look like \u201cwhy did you do that?\u201d And he realized that that was a weird thing to do. I don\u2019t know your sister or how she would react but maybe she just doesn\u2019t understand how others feel physically.",

When I said I'm basically a manager, I mean that I do sometimes fill in shifts and responsibilities for them, and we have talked about me officially being manager before, but it's not what I want. I don't want to take my work home with me and never be able to switch off like I see some of them do. That said, I do want to have some more ambition in my life going forward, and I am going to be looking at other ventures.\n* My clothes: My band clothes are now back at my house, I still have the new clothes we bought as I paid for a lot of them and I plan to continue wearing them too. I can see what she meant by wanting me to wear new clothes, I just didn't like her end goal or the way she went about it. For the people thinking I dress like those goth people dancing under a bridge, I don't. It's usually just a band tee/jumper with some normal jeans, I'm not a teenager, just a 30yo who still loves the same band haha. (No hate to those dancing goths, I love that meme)\n\nOK so on to the main story. I took advice from some of the responses to the OP, we live separately so there wasn't any issues with leases, but I did change my lock as I had given her a key a few months ago. As for the breakup, it didn't go well, but it did go at least. I was at home thinking of how to do it, which cafe/restaurant I was gonna do it in etc. She finished work and came to mine without any prior discussion, not out of the ordinary to be fair. Anyway she could tell something was off, and because I'd been thinking about it all for hours I was 150% sure I wanted to do it so just did it here instead. I first told her that I had lied about donating my clothes and that I'd actually taken them to work instead. She was angry and calling me a liar and everything. I apologized for it, and tried to explain that I felt a lot of unfair pressure to get rid of them when I didn't really want to and my collection wasn't hurting anyone. I don't really feel that the argument was fair, and I feel that her actions made me lie to her, but I hate saying stuff like that so I just left it and moved on. \n\nI then told her I was really annoyed about her calling my boss, she said she was sorry but I should be a manager, I said that's OK and she looked confused but accepted it I guess. Then I just said I didn't wat to be with her anymore because she actually had given me a second to speak. She looked shocked and asked me what I meant. I just said I didn't want to be with her anymore, and that I wanted her to leave and would be changing my locks but was open to calling to messaging about picking up her stuff. She said stuff like we don't have to break up but I kept saying my mind is made up and technically we already had, she called me pathetic as she walked out the door and slammed it behind her. This was the other day, I haven't heard from her but I sent her a message about picking up her stuff, there isn't much of it here so maybe she doesn't want to?\n\nAnyway, since then, I called my boss to explain that situation and be wary of any contact from her, we've worked together for years and we're good friends so he was very understanding and said if I need help in anyway he'll try to provide it. We go for drinks often with other colleagues so I'll explain it all to them there probably. \n\nAs for me, like I said above, I do want to work on myself a bit, partly because of the things she said, but not for the same reasons, just for me to grow a bit in terms of work experience and fashion sense. I'll be buying more 'smart causal' clothes to wear as well. I don't think I'll ever fully stop wearing the band clothes though hahahaha. I don't quite know what I want to do in terms of work, but I have the experience of team work and leadership from the store which I think is usable and transferable to other jobs too. \n\nI'm feeling weird, but OK, it feels great to have acted decisively, I haven't felt sad yet, not happy either just relieved mostly. Some of her stuff is still here and it feels weird to see it knowing it'll never be that way again, I don't know how to describe that feeling. Anyway I've spoken to friends about it and will be seeing them soon. Idk what she's been up to or what she'll do, not sure if I want to, there's nothing left for me with her anyway. \n\nJust wanted to thank everyone for their kind words in the OP, it felt really good to know I wasn't being treated fairly and I wasn't just being stupid like she said. Some even messaged me with similar stuff or how much they liked their partners with similar habits to my band clothes which was really nice. One of the reasons I still wear the band tees is sometimes other fans spot them and we'll have a nice conversation about it and always end the conversation smiling haha, it's just nice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR GF came to my house and it took an hour or so but I broke up with her and she left. Locks have been changed and clothes returned, thins are weird but definitely better. I'll be working on myself but doing it purely for me not for her or anyone else. Thanks again for kind words and advice everyone, hope you enjoyed the story.",

            "Not everyone wants to move up in their career. That\u2019s ok. If you can make what you need, then that\u2019s fine. Not everyone is cut out to be a manager. Do what you want. \nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re rid of your girlfriend. She was toxic and so negative. She wanted to change you to her vision of what you should be, not what you actually want.\nETA: thanks for the awards!!!",

            "I just read your original post and good riddance! I'm a manager (really wish I wasn't!) and you can pry my ridiculous metal tee's out of my cold, dead hands. Good on you for wanting to update where appropriate, but controlling your wardrobe is controlling/abusive behavior 101. You do that kind of thing--wardrobe or jobs--on YOUR terms, no one else's. Like strive for improvement for sure, but not because someone you're dating for less than a year strong-arms you into it.\n\nSeriously, good job standing your ground and making it happen. That was going to turn into something miserable, fast.",
            "I think the fact that you've been left feeling a bit feeling-less about the relationship actually being over in the days since it's done and mostly just relieved really shows how bad it was on some pretty deep levels and that you absolutely did the right thing in breaking it off.\n\nAlso sounds like you've taken some good out of it in the changes you want to make for yourself, growth is always good. You don't need to make huge dramatic changes for growth to happen, but you're at an age that the small steps you're thinking of will have a pay off for you down the road even just in giving your social life a little lift.\n\nAs for band clothes... you don't have to give them up to be a bit more versatile & flexible with your wardrobe. And mixing a cool worn band shirt with some good quality sleek jeans & a sport coat is a hot look. You can even have both at the same time :) \n\nGood luck man.",
            "Just read your original post and got all caught up and I'm happy you decided to break it off! She sounded very emotionally draining and like you said, it was good at first, but you only really get to know someone once you've been with them for a while and she was already starting to show you her red flags. Kudos to you for standing up for yourself :)",
            "Good for you. Keep wearing those band shirts and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Consider going to counseling if you're after personal growth. You need it after a girlfriend stepping on your boundaries like that.\n\nAs someone with OCD, I encourage you to get tested. You mentioned in the op that you think you might have it. Being diagnosed changed my life for the better.",
            "Well done. You did the right thing.",
            "Hopefully you were wearing one of the band shirts when you broke it off.",
            "You shouldn't have to change for anyone. Unless the changes are genuinely for your own good (not what someone else THINKS is good for you) and actually accrpted. She bullied, belittled and tried to contol you. She tried to stop you being you.\n\n\n\nSome people take partners as more of a project. It's a bad trait. \n\n\n\nI'm very happy with how things worked out for you.",

            "Don't worry about the clothes.  I am nearing forty and still wear a lot of band shirts from my favorite bands.  As well shirts that depict Masters of the Universe, Anime, Star Wars and other geekdom type apparel.  The right partner will not judge you on what you wear, but try to help you compliment it.",
            "Good for you! This worked out so well: you are considering your career, you recognized some areas for self-growth, and you stood up for yourself! My nearly 30-year-old boyfriend wears almost exclusively graphic tees and flannels, I'd never ask him to change that. I'm glad you hung on to your shirts.",

            "Read you original post and so glad this turned out this way. Funny how everything is fine and six months later she wants to change everything about you. Calling your boss is unreal. Telling you to change your clothing in this case is trying to change you. Those shirts mean something to you, it's a memory, a conversation starter, a reminder of great music, not to be confused with, say, wearing all brown every day.  I am in management and you are not missing anything. Anyway just wanted to say I am happy for you; you dodged a bullet if she is this controlling after only six months!",

            "I\u2019m glad you broke up. You deserve someone who likes you as you while still wanting you to grow and improve. \n\nYou can take her things and mail them to her home if you want to remove any excuses she might have to come over and try to get back together again. \n\nIt sounds like she viewed you as a project, not a person, and that is not a good basis for a relationship.",
            "She definitely went about it the wrong way but I see where she was coming from......when you described yourself you reminded me of my ex before he made life changes.....he looked like a hobo all the time and he was at a dead end job ready to give up on life.....when I suggested (not in a pushy way like your girl) that we try a different wardrobe, he gained alot of confidence from it and his personality changed and his outlook on life improved. He then had the confidence to take chances in himself and apply for higher positions and get better jobs. Literally a change of wardrobe and dumping lame t-shirts and things that didn't look good gave him the confidence to take his life to a new level. You might think it's not important but it actually is. I will say she did go about it the wrong way but she might have honestly just been trying to help you",

            "Good for you, OP! Sometimes people might think they have good intentions when they try to change their partner's ways, but it usually boils down to issues revolving: anxiety, control, being self-absorbed, not viewing their partner as a 3D being. \n\nI'm glad you want to process and make gradual changes for yourself. Stepping out of your comfort zone is one of the hardest things you can do.",
            "I'm over 50 and still almost always wear some form of jeans and a black t-shirt or sweatshirt, with hikers.   I work the same position I have for 20 years, because I love what I do and i have great work / life balance. \n\nGood for you for staying true to yourself!",
            "I'm glad that you stood up for yourself, and good luck to you in the future. \n\nAs far as her picking up her stuff, if I were in your position I would either send her a text message (one, single, last text message) or certified letter telling her she has 30 calendar days to arrange a time to remove her belongings from your apartment or they will be going in the dumpster. And then stick to that deadline. If she doesn't pick them up by that date, throw them away. Sometimes people \"forget\" their things at their exes apartment as a way to keep contact with them, at least for awhile, so it might be helpful to just eliminate the possibility of that happening as quickly as possible.",
            "I totally get ya on the anxiety as far as doing something different for work. I've had it as well, it really does get better the more you put yourself out there and have new experiences. It can be scary but the more you do it the more capable and confident you'll feel. It'll get easier from there.\n\nI have a lot of band tees that I no longer wear but I'm too attached to throw away. I have a coworker who sews and makes quilts a lot and I've considered asking if I could pay her to make a quilt with them. Or maybe learn to do it myself, I'll get more use out of them and they won't sit around collecting dust.",

            "OP, don't get rid of your band shirts ever for a person. Yes, having \"grown Up\" clothes for occasions is right but if you love them, you love them. My husband has around 50 black shirts because he buys one every festival and concert he goes to. Would have never crossed my mind to talk him out of that. You can't make a person completely different in a relationship. You weren't made for each other and that's fine.",
            "Pack her shit up in a box and put it somewhere safe (if you can put it in a separate storage locker, do that and tell her she can get it from there). Just so she doesn\u2019t pop back up in your life being annoying just because her stuff is there, she seems the type to play that kind of game. Also because it seems like you may be a bit anxious, so get rid of it.\n\nWell done on breaking up also, very strong. She seems the type to choose people like you because she thinks she can control you, good job for standing strong",
            "Take all her stuff you see and pack it in a box so when she does eventually come for it you can just hand her the box",
            "Thanks for the update.  Looks like you handled it well. In a way, she did leave you with some self reflection and change. Hopefully some people reading your story will do the same. The lesson is, work with someone to create change, not on them.",
            "Honestly, OP, some good quality staple pieces plus your band tees will totally make a well-rounded wardrobe. As someone mentioned above, a blazer and a nice pair of jeans plus your band tees is a great elevated casual outfit. I think tees and shoes are my favorite part of a guy's attire because they are a great way to express some fun personality while still looking a bit cleaned up. \n \nI'm really proud of you for making the decision to break up with her. Change is hard, especially when you have anxiety/OCD. You made a very positive change and that's wonderful!",
            "Good riddance. She sounds mentally unsound\u2026calling your boss was way out of line and for her to think that was an ok thing to do really makes me wonder what other entitlements she has.\n\n\nAlso, as long as you dress appropriately for things such as weddings, funerals, meetings, etc. then i don\u2019t see why you wearing band shirts is a thing whatsoever. As long as they\u2019re not dirty or raggedy when you\u2019re out and about who gives af? If she wants to date someone more fashionable then she should\u2019ve Found someone like that instead of making you throw out your belongings while you cried. Jfc I can\u2019t believe that\u2026that\u2019s not love, dude, or affection. \n\nAnyone with the \u201cyou\u2019re over 30, put away the bad tshirt\u201d attitude is just superficial. Same with ppl whining about women wearing leggings\u2026if it\u2019s just a casual situation, who cares?! Stay in your lane smh. It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to date someone like that, but don\u2019t force other people how to dress *period*. I\u2019m glad you got out of that.",
            "Some women are taught that men are projects, not people, and you have to find one with good potential and fix him up. \n\nI know some men who dated women like this, and seem fine with it. I find it super insulting. Just find someone who you like as they are? They think ALL men need a woman to fix them up. It's really common to seem chill for a few months and then at about 6 months or a year, start on a campaign of \"improvements.\"\n\nImagine if you had told her you wanted her to dress differently, cut her hair differently, wear makeup differently. People would call you controlling and tell you that that's red flag behavior. \n\nEveryone has room to improve, and you should find someone who is happy to encourage you and support you, but doesn't NEED to you to make those changes. \n\nAlso, I have a pretty low paying job I love. People work super hard their whole lives to get to the point I'm at, where they can have low stress and responsibility. Like you, I have investments. I just make enough to live on every month, and in exchange have nearly zero stress, and can put my attention and energy on things besides my job. \n\nSo move up if you want to, but not everyone needs to find meaning in their work. It's okay just to work to cover bills, and spend your energy and passion on other things.",
            "Woah\u2026 I am in disbelief but I\u2019m really glad you got rid of her. She is incredibly toxic and definitely wanted to change you to suit her own ideal. \n\nIMO you shouldn\u2019t have to get rid of your old clothes. It\u2019s definitely good to have something smarter or whatever for different/special occasions but wear whatever you want, as you said in your previous post \u2014 you aren\u2019t hurting anyone. Same for the career, climbing the ladder isn\u2019t for everyone. As long as you\u2019re happy and not struggling financially, what should it matter? \n\nDo what makes you happy and when it comes to future partners, take this as a lesson. If someone wants to change you, they aren\u2019t worth it. More importantly, if someone is to insult you and call you names? Drop them. You deserve a lot better and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find it too.",

            "I sent you a DM with some pointers. It's sad that instead of empowering you to make changes on yourself by noting the benefits, she tried to live your life for you. And that she called you pathetic when she left, is because she already felt you were, she just didn't say it because she had hopes that you could be her little project.\n\nLet her go, work on yourself man, I would suggest you go to some therapy for your anxiety, there's a lot to life, don't let it go to waste just because you fear a few stumbles. To win, you gotta learn how to lose... remember that the hero starts always as a fool.",

Sometimes seeing the true nature of the people we trust is very hard; it has happened to me a lot and is a big reason why I\u2019m pretty cynical about many things, unfortunately. I\u2019m proud of you though, and as a metal fan who loves wearing band shirts (and currently has a girlfriend who does too and would never judge me for wearing them!), I think you fucking rock. Keep on keeping on, and remember to always look out for yourself and be the best YOU that you can be.\n\nCheers",

Honestly I\u2019ve found it much easier if I can make a bullet point list, not to directly read it off to them, but to help keep it black and white with my mind firmly made up, plus to remember everything I wanted to say. Honestly I lost it the moment you said she was forcing you to throw out all the shirts you liked and called you stupid when you started crying. Your feelings there were totally valid and I can\u2019t believe she pushed you that hard! Ironic how it\u2019s valid for her to obsess over your clothes but not valid for you to care about our own. But in the end you really did great!",

Maybe, *perhaps*, her intentions were good, but her behavior was abhorrent. You didn't deserve that shit. She should have backed off **way** before you had to lie.\n\nMy SO has a pair of fleece lounge pajama bottoms that they have loved forever. These things were worn the hell out, so I got them another pair the next Christmas. They never wore them, saying they didn't feel as comfortable. Obviously I didn't *love* that answer, but it was their decision to make because it was a gift, not a demand for capitulation. Same with some of their shirts: more holes than shirt almost. Yes, I ask them to think of where we're going (like, \"plz no holes when we're going out to eat\"), but if they really want to wear it, I recognize they are their own person and I can't (and won't) order or wheedle them. Ordering and wheedling a loved one, (beyond normal back and forth that ends when that person says to stop), is wrong.\n\nEnjoy branching out on your own terms, dude.",
            "Good job, bravo! As someone who wears business casual for work, keep those band shirts, 100% I'm sitting here in my knee high socks, cat leggings (cats with glasses!)

And I'll be happy with myself and how I'm dealing with life....at least as much as one can be! \n\nAlso, it feels great looking professional when I need to but I love my work clothes too...they're all comfortable and can be incorporated into my normal wardrobe. You've got this:)",
            "I've been with my now husband for 10 years, and he still wears a lot of his high school shirts. Lots of band, arty, graphic tshirts. They fit him still and he likes them, so its whatever to me. The only time I will ask him if its okay to toss a tshirt is if its tearing apart, and hes only kept a few of those for senteminal reseasons. I tend to buy him his newer clothes for part of a bday or holiday gift. But generally speaking its his stuff and he can do what he wants with it.",
            "I have OCD, formally diagnosed, big time therapy, medication, all that jazz. There is NOTHING wrong with staying at a company you like with a job you're good at. A lot of people overextend themselves trying to jobs they think they should, then end up really struggling. Keep at it for now and if you want to leave later, you can!\n\nI would recommend getting evaluated for OCD, having a diagnosis and a treatment/management plan can be really helpful. OCD usually doesn't look how it does in the movies, it presents in lots of ways. If you get evaluated, see an OCD SPECIALIST not some rando therapist whose website mentions OCD among a slew of other things.",

            "She\u2019s awful. Telling you to change how you dress was terrible. Wanting you to get rid of those clothes was terrible. I dated a guy once who had awful taste. He wore only plain colored shirts. And a lot of them were brown which I hate. He wore those clothes when I fell in love with him. I just complimented him every time he wore a blue shirt cause I liked that the most. Noticed he started wearing them more, haha. Never told him I hated the way he dressed. Never asked him to change that. We\u2019re not even dating anymore and he still doesn\u2019t know I hated the way he dressed. I wasn\u2019t dating his clothes. Haha. People shouldn\u2019t ask you to change. Now certain behaviors I can see, if they changed. Like if you had a lot of affection at first and then no affection, please try and change things like that. But I could never understand trying to change someone that you fell for. They were good enough before, right?",
            "Good for your for standing your ground and not letting her talk her way back in.

You don't need to fabricate ambition you don't have to please other people.\n\nAlso, I'm dying to know which band lol",

We work because we have to and try to find options that gives us the least amount of suffering. We rent an apartment that we want to grow old in.

While there's nothing wrong with wanting to pursue fashion or the next career step, it's not for everyone. Life's short, and you should do what gives you the most joy. Don't change just because other people say you should. Especially if it's your partner. When you meet the person who's gonna fall in love with your emo band t-shirt collection, it would be a shame if you had gotten rid of it.\n\nI'm learning to live according to my own standards, and to not look for everyone else's approval.
