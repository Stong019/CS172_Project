Friend (\u201cK\u201d in post) that knows the history of our relationship asked me to \u201cstep aside\u201d so he could try to date L.\n\n[link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ckqgjc/repost_my_20m_friends_22m_wants_me_to_step_aside/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)\n\nI wanted to thank everyone that took the time to respond to my post and update anyone who might be interested in the outcome.\n\nI have been staying with L for about a week now, since the initial confrontation with K and thanks to people here, I was sure I wanted to ask her if she wanted to make things more official. She ended up making things even easier for me, as luck would have it. L asked me if it might make things easier if I just told K that she was my girlfriend. I jumped on that opportunity and asked if I could tell everyone she is my girlfriend, and she said yes! She and I are going to look at a few apartments this week, since I obviously need a new living situation, and we want to move in together.\n\nK and I had a few brief discussions after he told me he wanted to be with L. I had told her everything K had said to me, and she was not the least bit interested in him, which I had assumed. I also told him that she is officially my girlfriend now, so that should satisfy his concerns about me not committing to her. He refused to believe any of it without confirmation from her, in person, without me around. She initially agreed to meet with him on Sunday, with the plan that they would meet at her house (since she lives with her mom and stepdad), but he rejected that, saying he wanted to meet at the apartment, without me there. She told him she wasn\u2019t comfortable with that, if he wanted to meet up without me or her parents there they at least had to be somewhere public. He got pissed that his threatening behavior made her feel threatened and went on a tirade, called her every name in the book. She told him she wasn\u2019t going to see him again at all and blocked his number. He has tried reaching out to me a few times ranging from sad to aggressive, and I\u2019m about a text or 2 away from blocking him as well. Hopefully he\u2019ll just move on and it won\u2019t come to that.\nAgain, thank you to the posters who helped me navigate this situation!\n\nTL;DR- L is now officially my girlfriend and we are going to move in together. K made unreasonable requests when L agreed to discuss their friendship, then blew up at her, so she ended up blocking him.\n\nEDIT:  To clarify, we both wish him well, but neither of us want to continue a friendship with him under any circumstances. Since posting this I have also blocked him. I agree with posters that there is no point in keeping any lines of communication open anymore. I have also reached out to some friends to help get the rest of my stuff out, but I was already able to get everything important when I first left. He can make a shrine out of my old shirts if he really wants.",

            "I just wanted to comment on the ages involved. You say that you've been dating on and off for three years, which would make L 15 at the time that K met her, while he was 19. Your own age gap is questionable, although two years is nothing between adults, when you're dealing with people under 18 it's a very different story. \n\nMy main issue is with K, because quite simply a man who is 19 should not want after a 15 year old. There's a reason that that's illegal. You need to be very careful with this dude, because there's a reason that he's not seeking a relationship with somebody who is 20+, and I've no doubt that part of that reason has to do with him wanting to see L while she is completely alone and vulnerable. He would have assaulted her, and will do if given the chance. You need to steer clear of him completely. Make a paper trail documenting every attempt at contact he makes, and be vigilant.",
            "Are yall not in the US? Cause the explanation insinuates that you've beem with L as an underaged girl. So 3 years ago she would have been 15/16 and you 19/20. Those are red flags where I come from.\n\nEdit: I reread the title and can confirm I am an Idiot. I fucked up thinking you were 22 and your friend was 20.  This makes your friend seem more of a creep since it looks like he basically waited around for her to be legal. Yikes.",

I wouldn't.  Go to the local police station talk to a few cops, explain what's going on.  Ask if any are off duty insert day.  Ask them to \"help you move\" you'll provide beer and pizza.  \n\nOff duty they can do what ever they want and it's not an official police matter.  But if he tries anything or says anything... they are off duty police officers and their word in court or to a judge about a restraining order carries a shit ton of weight.  \n\nI'd say for the beer and pizza you'll get a couple takers.

I suspect he will want to bury it, accept the reality, and move on. were i in your shoes, i'd refuse to allow this to be burried. His behavior shows a complete lack of self control and self awareness. this makes him dangerous for everyone around him. Were i in your shoes i'd confront him privately, lay out the facts, and show him the opportunity for a continued friendship if he is willing to meet some basic needs around self awareness and self control. \n\nif this person is not interested in exerting themselves in this way, you have a responsibility to make it known so that folks around him are aware of the risks they assume with him.",

K said he wanted to make sure I didn\u2019t \u201cmess with his stuff\u201d which is ironic, since he tried messing with my relationship. Friend A then offered to act as a buffer so friend B and I could get my stuff out. \n\nWhen we first got to the apartment, K was obviously drunk but calm and seemed almost apologetic. I had already decided I wasn\u2019t going to engage with him at all, because I don\u2019t see the point anymore. He did not like being ignored apparently and started going off, gradually saying worse and worse shit. He started saying shit about L, but I was able to ignore him and let it roll off my back until he told me I \u201cmight need to fuck her up and get her in line.\u201d He knows her ex before me was abusive.

            "Good job, OP.  You'll find in relationships that it's always best to be candid and upfront, even about \"labels.\"  I've straight up asked girlfriends to be \"exclusive\" because, after enough bad experiences, you learn that you have to ask straight up questions in order to be on the same page.\n\nRegarding K, he's a bad friend for disrespecting your relationship with L in the first place, though the silver lining to this is his actions stimulated a growing point in your relationship with L.  It's fair if he asked \\[your permission to pursue L romantically\\], but since you weren't okay with it and he pressed forth regardless shows he's a bad friend.  To follow, he greatly disrespected your partner, so he has disrespected you (he's also lucky you didn't punch him in the face).  I think you should be straight up with him as well: \"K, you are one text message away from me blocking you.  I value our friendship, and though it's been under strain in recent time, I'm willing to try to retain what friendship still remains...but your behavior is rapidly burning that bridge.\"  Most likely, you'll have to block him, but good riddance since his behavior plainly ~~said~~ shows that he ~~didn't~~ doesn't value your friendship, anyway.\n\nedited",

I did not say anything as I was really worried what would happen if I said anything. When I was about 12 years old, I found my dad looking at pictures of our family and tearing up and I couldn't take it and I told him about moms affair. Fastforward 5 years and I live full time with dad and his new wife and step sister and our lives have improved so much since leaving mom. \n\nWell grandpa on dad's side has been pressuring my dad to get a paternity test as he wants to make sure that \"I am his grand daughter\". This is getting really intense as grandpa may pass away soon and he says he doesn't know if he should leave us anything if he doesn't even know...\n\nWell my dad has resisted this for years and saying it doesn't matter. But now things have changed as I have half sibling on the way. I am totally happy and fine with this, but for some reason my dad has started to change his mind about the paternity dna test thing. He says he is worried that I won't receive help with my college or anything, but im worried he is wondering if he should care about me or just my new sibling.\n\nI am not sure how much money my grandpa has, but he does have a big house and a lot of property so I guess it's important. I would rather just continue with our relationship how it is... but I don't know what to do now and i haven't been able to sleep over this.\n\nWhat do you think I should do?\n\nTlDR: dad says we should get paternity test for me, but im worried he won't love me if it goes wrong.",

It sounds like your grandfather on the other hand may have some other, dated, notions.\n\nSit down with your father and tell him exactly what is on your mind - read him your tl/dr.

I've considered dna tests before but same as your dad decided it doesn't matter.\n\nI want to get them done someday, but more because i just feel like everybody deserves to know. I can tell you from a fathers perspective it would not change anything.\n\nIt sounds like it is mostly due to your grandfather and your dad wants you to get something in will.\n\nYou should 100% talk to your dad about this. Just tell him how this is making you feel and ask him how he feels about it. I think it would make you feel better",

            ">im worried he won't love me if it goes wrong.\n\nYou need to talk to your dad about this because based on your post, I think your fears will come true, at least in regards to your grandfather.\n\n>he wants to make sure that \"I am his grand daughter\"\n\nThis is a really shitty thing to say to you.  Talk to your dad about how this has hurt you and that you're worried you won't be his granddaughter if it comes back.  Grandpa can be spoken to later if your talk with Dad goes well.  Side question, is stepsister considered a granddaughter?  If she is, you can point out she isn't bio and still a granddaughter so why would your DNA matter?  Especially since he always considered you a granddaughter before.\n\n>but im worried he is wondering if he should care about me or just my new sibling\n\nWhile your father hasn't been as... direct as your grandfather, bring up you are concerned about him too.  Point out it that it has been 5 years since the affair was found out and the brand new, definitely his child combined with your grandfather's statements make you think he now wants you to not be his and to get out of his new, definitely his family.  Why is he so concerned with this NOW vs 5 years ago?  What has changed about how he feels about you?  Ask him what he WANTS the results to be and what happens if it comes back the other way?\n\n\nI really hope your father is genuinely concerned about college, but unless you are no longer legally his child, something feels...off.  If he is legally your parent, fafsa should consider his income (if you're US), so does he plan on helping you with college?\n\n\n\nYou need to have a serious talk with him about your very legitimate fears.  I am not sure if they can force you to take the test, but they can still kick you out at 18 regardless of whether you do or not.  I really hope this just turns out to be fears and they love you anyway, but you might want to start preparing for the worst case scenario.",
            "Its sucks, but as a father I wouldn't get it done because it wouldn't matter. You've been his daughter all your life. He'll still be your dad.",
            "As a dad raising a kid that's not \"mine\" and one that likely is but could not be....... it doesn't matter.  At all. I love them both and my paternity doesn't change that in any way.     \n\nBut.   You don't know what's being said behind closed doors.  Remember, that just like you don't want your relationship to change with your dad,  he likely doesn't want his to change(or end badly) with his dad.   That very well may mean nothing between you two would change at all, but he may just be trying to keep a relationship with his father.   \n\nI know honesty can be hard and awkward. But it sounds like your dad is trying to keep your best interests at heart and please his dying father at the same time.  I would sit him down and reassure him that you love him and appreciate the relationship that you have and don't want it to change,  but that you also appreciate his situation with his father.   Let him know you're there to help and support him as well.  \n\nBest of luck.",
            "> He says he is worried that I won't receive help with my college or anything, but im worried he is wondering if he should care about me or just my new sibling.\n\nYour dad didn\u2019t want the test for years.  I don\u2019t see any reason to think he has changed his mind just because you have a half-sibling in the way.  I would believe him when he said he\u2019s concerned about the inheritance.\n\nHOWEVER: even though he believes he doesn\u2019t care, he may find that he has changed his mind  if the result comes back negative.  He may go into this with the best of intentions to not let the answer change his feelings, and then discover that his feelings changed anyway.\n\nTalk to your dad about this concern.  Unless the inheritance is a life changing amount of money, I would say skip the test unless your dad really does want it for himself. Your dad does have a right to know.\n\nIf your grandpa wants to make sure his inheritance only goes to blood relatives, then he can leave the money in a trust to your brother.",
            "I don\u2019t think your dad cares what the DNA test will say. You are and always will be his little girl. I think what he\u2019s worried about is how his fathers actions or lack of actions will affect you. Your father is trying to protect you because he loves you.",
            "I have 4 kids, only 2 of them are biologically mine. \n\nDo not worry, it makes no difference. If he is a good Dad it is because he loves you not because of DNA.",
            "If I was in your dad's position and my ass-backwards old man wanted proof that my child was his biological grandchild, lest he withhold her future educational fund, I'd definitely be writing and delivering a fake paternity test. I just assume that anyone who thinks DNA determines family membership would be too dense to see through the ruse.\n\nI would also be honest with your dad about your feelings. Tell him it's your wish that a paternity test is not done because you are already feeling a bit insecure that he will see you as equally important to his new baby, and throwing a DNA test into that mix would not be good for you right now. You're more worried what he will think than your grandpa. Given that he's never wanted to do one before and he's always had you living with him, it seems likely that he sees you as his daughter either way and he will be able to reassure you more than we can on reddit. \n\nNew babies and youngest kids get a lot of attention, especially in new relationships, but remember - you were his first child and that's a *very* special place in his life to have too. You will probably still be all his \"firsts\", his first kid to go off on their own, first kid he had a legal beer with, first kid he walked down the aisle, first kid to give him a grandchild, etc.",
            "Hi! As an adopted person (23F) I\u2019ll just say that whether or not you\u2019re biologically related shouldn\u2019t matter here. He\u2019s still your dad no matter what. It sounds to me like grandpa is pressuring here and your dad doesn\u2019t share that view. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this, and I hope you can share how you feel with your dad and get some reassurance there. Much love to you in this challenging situation but blood doesn\u2019t mean love and I am very hopeful that your dad will continue to stand up for u.",
            "I would tell Grandpa that the paternity test came back that you are 110% his daughter.\n\nI think this is a justifiable lie.",

It\u2019s probably your grandpa threatening to write him out COMPLETELY if he doesn\u2019t agree to this. I don\u2019t think your dad is planning to toss you out, even if it does turn out you\u2019re not his bio kid.\n\nI would talk to your dad about your fears, he loves you, and you need to be able to trust that he has your best interests at heart. Give him the chance to explain himself.",
            "I wouldn\u2019t do a paternity test until you\u2019re out of your father\u2019s house and to a place in your life where, if your dad reacts badly, the harm is only emotional and not financial. As much as it seems like he would understand, it\u2019s rough, people don\u2019t always react how you\u2019d expect, and there\u2019s a new sibling on the way, which changes the dynamic.\n\nAlso, what happens if the paternity test comes back negative with regards to your grandfather? You wouldn\u2019t get the money anyway.\n\nI\u2019d frame it as \u201cI\u2019ll love you no matter what, but I just can\u2019t deal with even the smidgeon of a possibility you\u2019re not my dad right now.

            "Sounds like grandpas a bit of a twat",
            "What a strangely relevant post to my life. I don't know if my mom ever cheated on my dad after they were married, but my dad was concerned enough that when I was 17 he made my brother and I both get paternity tests. There was also a family inheritance at stake, although not half-siblings. OP, I know some of what you must be feeling, and I'm so sorry. I remember being so terrified that if I wasn't my dad's kid that he wouldn't love me anymore, or would throw me out. I was afraid that our extended family would find out, and that they wouldn't see me as a real member of their family. I don't think he ever knew how heartbreaking the whole situation was for me, even though both my brother and I turned out to be his children. It's been 15 years and it still haunts me that I don't know what he would have done if I'd turned out not to be his child. The wound is just unbelievable. I think that if you have similar fears, you should talk through them with your dad, and make a plan in case you turn out to not be his bio-kid. Who will know the results, besides your dad and grandfather? What role is your stepmother playing in this, since I presume she feels she has a stake in it? Do you actually *want* to know for sure? I would also suggest that you tell your dad/grandfather that if they want you to consider this at all, they need to get you a therapist *right now* so that you can have an uninvolved adult whose primary concern is your well-being, not their own money or potential money. All of the adults involved here have a financial stake, which means that their advise will be biased and not necessarily in your best interest, as much as they love you. Hugs, OP. No matter what you decide to do, you haven't done anything wrong.",
            "I feel like it\u2019s really crappy of them to want the test. If YOU wanted it, then ok. But denying you an inheritance based on your DNA would be really awful. Are you able to refuse the test? They need your DNA, right?",
            "Wow your grandpa basing if you should be given an inheritance based on guaranteeing you\u2019re his biological grandkid is fked up. You\u2019ve been his grand daughter since you were born. Genetics don\u2019t change that. A lifetime of memories and love is what matters. It\u2019s like is an adopted child any less than?? That\u2019s so so sad. Since your dad has resisted the paternity test I\u2019m not really worried about him loving you less but you know him, I don\u2019t.",
            ">This is getting really intense as grandpa may pass away soon and he says he doesn't know if he should leave us anything if he doesn't even know.\n\nWhy is your father not protecting you? Even if paternity is challenged you essentially are his adopted and actual family.\n\nThat's messed up.\n\nThe clear solution is just to have him lie to your grandfather. He's going to be dead soon and his backwards horrific, abusive standards are dying off with that generation. He essentially is subscribing to the bastard child idea which is like 500 years out of date.\n\nIf things change definitely talk to a lawyer as you have rights within the family. Go very public as well after verifying if this is smart with the lawyer.",
            "Low-key, just get the test done and make it a painless process. We all live our own lives and if he deems a stick of information is more important than his relationship with you then you can establish he's an a\"\"\"h\"\"\" anyways.",

            "You know, I try to advocate for honesty. But, the fact of the matter is, sometimes lying is the better route to go. In my opinion, this is one of those instances. It shouldn't matter to your Grandpa if it doesn't matter to your Dad. And, unless he has done a really good job of hiding it, it hasn't mattered to him for however many years. So, if his only concern truly is his inheritance (and you getting help with school), suggest to your Dad that he lie to your Grandpa, and tell him that you guys did a DNA test, and you are without a shadow of a doubt biologically his. I am very sorry your mother has put you in this situation. And what everyone involved needs to realize, is that none of it is your fault. He raised you as his kid, so even on the very slight off chance that you aren't his biological daughter, you are still his daughter. And he is your Dad. Like I said, honesty is usually the best policy. But this is one of those very unique situations, and honestly,  why should it matter after all these yeats?",

            "I agree with several other responses that say talking to your dad is the most important thing you can do here. Express all your fears and hopefully he can share with you his.\n\nMy guess, based on the context given (and it may be totally wrong but this is the impression I get), is that he fears that grandpa is considering removing him entirely from the will and allocating what would have been for your father to your step-brother. Previously, I would guess that the situation was not significant enough to completely cut your father out of his will, but now given the context with grandpa and that possibility, I think your father just wants to be able to see you taken care. \n\nI could be totally off base, but if I were you, I would share my concerns with him and in plain language request an earnest and blunt response from him of his fears and motivations.",

Before we took the test my father and I had a long conversation about what it would mean and how our lives would look if the results showed I wasn\u2019t his biologically. Do the same with your father (because DNA doesn\u2019t make a father, the person who raised you does).",
            ">Well grandpa on dad's side has been pressuring my dad to get a paternity test as he wants to make sure that \"I am his grand daughter\". This is getting really intense as grandpa may pass away soon and he says he doesn't know if he should leave us anything if he doesn't even know...\n\nSo your grandpa is going to cut his own definite son out because there's a question mark over that son's daughter?\n\nSomething isn't quite right there, tbh. Does your grandpa often act in controlling ways?",
            "If I were in your shoes, (I had a job at 17, so I'm assuming that you do too)?\n\nI would secretly do a test without telling my dad. Give a friend the results and have my friend either tell me \"yes or it was inconclusive\". If it's yes, then I'll just give it to my grandpa and demand a refund. \n\nIf it's \"in conclusive\" well then, I would just hysterically cry everytime it would be brought up. \n\n\nAs an adult. I would say \"this is beyond fucked to ask of me. How about if I take the test then you are both out of my life regardless of the results because apparently love means nothing to you guys. I don't have time for people like you in my life.\"\n\nChances are the need to keep blood would be higher then losing someone you love that's not blood. Which is definitely backwards.\n\nBut you don't need to lie, manipulate, or hide things, once you understand people's motives. You just have to call them out on their bullshit. And they panic because often they did not even understand their bullshit. \n\nBest case scenario your cruel grandfather thinks he is protecting his son from a crazy ex wife and her child. Worst case, your dad doesn't want to invest any more time in someone who might leave him for a different dad, which is probably silly for you but based in his fear. \n\nIf you're grandfather is just an idiot, your terrified dad would beg him to back off if you threaten to leave over it.\n\nIf it backfired I would take the test for financial gains and play my exit strategy as I personally don't want people like that in my life. Cash pay for the risk of truama if I wasn't related. \n\nEither way you don't need your grandfather's money. Just learn how to graduate college early, save money during college, and pay off loans as much as possible. Read Rich Dad Poor Dad and you'll escape the rat race eventually.",
            "The moment a man finds out his wife is unfaithful, he is going to at least think about verifying every sector of his existence (as a comedian once said, there's no bigger than lie than, 'its your baby'), because everything about the relationship has been called into question, especially his legacy (children and grandchildren). \n\nPeace of mind, is everything.",
            "It sucks, but your dad seems to love the same as he raised you as his own. Your granddad's love seems to be conditional on dna/ and maybe its not love at all. he saw your growing up as his grandkid yet he would happily leave with no inheritance if your dna doesnt match one - dont care much for this guy and his opinions. his love is superficial. and about inheritance many ppl live without it and happy/ you have your family, your dad, you can get a loan or scholarship.   get a paternity test if you want certaintly, its good to know whos genes you have  . Dad is who raised and spent years and energy and money raising you. i doubt he would change his opinion since he was doing it out of his will and nt under pressure of obligation being dad. He was resisting the paternity test.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou can also resist the test and don't mind this situation at all. let your grandfather deal with his problem and inheritance by himself. since both of you dont want it. you are almost grown up and your dads responsibiilty to you almost over and anyway now your relationships is mainly based on mutual love and care for each other. So being his daughter or not , this should not affect much your relatioshhip if it wont get in your head. Be ready tha tif you have a half sibling  on a way your family would have to give him lots of their attention and time and it would be happen regardless the dna test. that's normal.",

That he would ask you for a paternity test is very upsetting and beyond insulting.\n\n\\> grandpa on dad's side has been pressuring my dad to get a paternity test\n\nYour grandfather is a horrible person--I think we can agree there--and whatever his opinion is should have NO bearing on how your father treats you. And should have no bearing on whether you submit to this totally unnecessary and demoralising paternity test. Your father should be telling his father that this is none of his affair, and that should be the end of it.",

I can only hope that if it does come to that, your dad still does what he's supposed to do and makes sure he let's you know how much he loves you whether your his biological child or not.",

            "Your grandfather is an asshole.\n\nYou are his granddaughter whether you share 1/4 of his genes or not. The idea of having a relationship with a child then suddenly cutting them off due to genes is appalling. What sort of person thinks like that?",
            "As a dad who isn't 100% about my kids paternity (coincidentally also military and similar circumstances) I've also considered getting paternity tests.\n\nI love my son and my daughter.  They will ALWAYS be the loves of my life. \n\nI cherish them and the circumstances of their birth will NEVER change that.\n\nBut...  There's this lingering uncertainty in the air...  Part of me just wants to KNOW so that I don't have that question pop in my head every time I notice my son's eyes and hair are light while my ex's and mine are dark...\n\nIt's like this itch that never *quite* goes away.\n\nNo matter what though, he is my son and I will always love him.\n\nI raised him, I changed his diapers, I taught him to walk and how to be a good person.  I taught him to stand up for himself and others.  I taught him the right way to peel a banana and that peanut butter honey banana sandwiches on toast is the greatest food ever created.  \n\nHe is my son.\n\nI just want that lingering annoyance in the air to stop bugging me so that I can just get over it and move on.\n\nSorry for the ramble, just thought I'd share my thoughts as I can kinda relate to your dad.  If he loves you then it won't matter, but it might scratch an itch that keeps bugging him... Or maybe your gramps is loaded and he's just trying to set you up for success with a good college fund?  \n\nEither way, I hope it works out well for you.",
            "You need to talk to your Dad and tell him what you told us here. He's loved and cared for you for 17 years, I doubt a new sibling will change that. But I understand as a teen with a lot of stress that that is what you are assuming. I think your Dad is honestly just worried about paying for your college as he won't receive the help from Grandpa.

            "This is awful. I had similar situation with my father. Parents got divorced when I was 9 (no affairs though) and my father wanted a DNA test once I was close to 18. The court said it\u2019s too late to test the DNA, he could have done it when I was little, not when I\u2019m almost an adult. Long story short, he passed away couple of months ago and left everything that he owned to his sister. So on one hand it\u2019s better if you just do the test but I\u2019d first talk to your mother to see if there is even a small chance the test may confirm that you\u2019re not his daughter.",

You're not to be judged by the actions of your mom.",
            "Man, as a product of divorce myself, get yourself some therapy as soon as you can. Watching your guardian start to choose their spouse and his new family over you is a harsh drama to watch slowly unfold and it can really affect your self-worth. Try to get some help even if you think you're fine. Don't be like me and wait until you're 40 and look back at all the asshole decisions your parents made deliberately or sometimes subconsciously.

They wanted my brother. \n\nMy father stayed married and my mother took off with my brother leaving me with friends as a toddler. She says it was because I was ugly. Father informed but not interested when I went into foster care and I stayed there until I found out who they were at 18. I've read the court papers as to my foster care.  They just didn't want me. My childhood was horrific. My father maintained contact with my mother and brother. \n\nI have always lived 30 minutes away at most from my birth parents in the same area. \n\nMy grandmother was coincidentally my neighbour. She found out who I was through gossip and would send photos of me growing to my birth parents as a joke. She knew about the abuse and did nothing. She's dead. \n\nI left 'home' at 17 was homeless and have done everything myself. My full and half siblings from both sides have been well looked after by my parents. \n\nAt 18+ I reached out to them and my father was remarried and made plans to see me repeatedly he never showed up for. He said it would upset his new family.  My mother had a lot more children and had forgotten about me really. I contacted them when I had my son and that was it and I heard nothing back.  \n\nUNTIL. I've been in the media a fair bit and my friends have told me that my parents have been bragging about me and taking credit for how I look and my successes.  My mother's side of the story is now that I was cruelly ripped from her breast and forced into foster care. She compares herself to the irish homes of unwed mothers and forced adoptions. Oh WOE IS HER. My father is now an example of the injustice of the court system against fathers and how this is just further proof!  Oh WOE IS HIM. \n\nThey talk about how I look like so and so and that I wouldn't be here without them. That my nieces and nephews Ive never met are 'just like me' and how I should give them the same opportunities I have had in my career. How that's what we do for 'family'. How I need to 'grow up' and get past it. \n\nI blocked contact after they wanted things, but this nonsense spreads easily and I am sick of being whispered about.  I don't want anything off them, I want to be left alone. They want me to meet their other grandkids at parties and they've apologised for the govt/family/god possibly/ the great spaghetti monster keeping us apart.\n\nIf I contact them it is further fuel for the fire. If I don't stand up for myself I look heartless and cruel. \n\nI don't want to leave just yet as my son is finishing school soon, I just want them to stop. \n\nAny advice?\n\ntl:dr parents terrible taking advantage of my successes how to stop them.",

Yesterday, we sat down and had a proper conversation. I apologized to her for lashing out with an ultimatum, I explained how scared I was of things sliding back. She (28F) was able to understand it and she also pointed out how hurtful me setting down and ultimatum was. I talked about mapping out a plan so that we don't slid into the mess we had created.\n\nI think me being open to the idea of her working allowed her to be vulnerable and reveal why she wanted to chase money. She wants to put down roots in the city and buy a house here. she grow up in pretty unstable circumstance and moved around a lot. She is adamant that we own a house before we get married/have kids and the home market here is booming. She also thought that it was a bit embarrassing to be so fixated on owning a house and wanted to take the whole burden on herself. I really love this woman. I know that her actions in the past has not been great but even after that I trust her to be kind.\n\nI think, this perspective is not something I could have ever thought of , I come from a more privileged background and even though my parents raised us to be independent but we always knew that if things got ugly, we had a safety net. She never had that and I understand her need to create one. After we stopped crying and talking. we went through the budget and talked about areas where we could cut expenses.\n\nShe really doesn't want to change jobs, so we are planning on her asking for a raise and I think I will start looking for a new job. I am pretty indifferent about my workplace and I don't mind jumping ship to increase my salary. She is happy and would have disliked to move to another company.\n\nI have to really thank the people here for helping us talk this out. I am planning on bringing up counselling on a later date. we have a lingering issue on communication that we need to sort out.\n\nTl;DR: we talked it out and I found out what she wanted and she was worried about money. We made a plan to fix it.",

            "Congratulations on y'all having a difficult conversation to mend bad feelings and begin finding solutions. I hope y'all are able to alter things in a way that gives you both what you want without sacrificing healthy behaviors and respectful communication tactics. It sounds to me like y'all are back on track or at least getting there. It can be hard at times to swallow your pride and admit fault (ie your ultimatum as well as her lashing out at you), but these actions are great investments in your relationship. Best wishes to both of you. I hope y'all find ways to continue to improve your communication as you each grow and change. Cheers again on this breakthrough!\n\nEdited to add: I really think it could help for her to seek professional guidance on managing stress as well as couple's counseling, and maybe you speaking to someone to deal with your unresolved pain of her having lashed out in the past. \n\nY'all avoided a potential issue with her taking on a stressful job, but relationships, transition into marriage, wedding planning, purchasing a home, having children, and many other life changes (or lack of change like stagnation, boredom, or the feeling of being unfulfilled) will eventually occur. It is normal to be stressed sometimes and have occasional anxiety, but it is not acceptable for anyone to resort to emotional and verbal abuse as a way of dealing with those emotions.\n\nYou both deserve to be respected and to be in a safe environment: emotionally, physically, and sexually. To prevent a relapse of her behavior it is a good idea to seriously consider professional assistance in order to find the root cause of her bad coping strategies and to replace them with healthy strategies. I have multiple anxiety disorders, and I have intermittently sought out therapy when I find I am utilizing unhealthy coping skills.",

            "Hey, I'm glad you guys worked things out. But...did she acknowledge the severity of the abuse she put you through during her last stint at a stressful job? You describe that time as \"the worst years of your life\" and say that even now, years down the line, you feel \"fear and panic\" at the thought of repeating that to the extent that you felt the need to lash out the way you did. Was lashing out wrong? Yes, technically. But you didn't do that as some manipulative tactic because you wanted to get your way. You did that because you were traumatized from her behavior and it caused you to respond impulsively. She may deserve some sort of apology for that, but *you* deserve a huge apology from her for the way that she treated you when she was under stress. Stress is not a good enough excuse to yell at someone consistently for three years. Life contains stressful events, and at some point, everyone has to learn how to deal with stress without abusing the people around us. Most people can manage that, even when they are under considerable stress. I'm very concerned that you don't mention your girlfriend acknowledging the pain that she caused you. I'm very concerned that you appear to be taking full blame for lashing out this one time, when your girlfriend lashed out consistently for a very long time and gave meaningless apologies only to continue the behavior. This is all very concerning, honestly. Please take care of yourself.",

You two need to build a solid foundation of communication skills and handling lifes stresses TOGETHER. Most people try to rebuild the relationship by going to relationship therapy after everything is falling down. Imagine how bullet proof you two will be if you build it up before all the really hard stuff hits you.\n\n Also, if you will have a pattern of working things out with your counselor, it won't be a big red flag if one of you says \"we need a session to deal with such and such.\" Use the opportunity to get deeper into next stage of life planning. I've seen marriages break up because of parenting styles being different, one person going back to their religious upbringing, not wanting kids after all, huge differences on spending habits...on and on.",

            "Really glad this has a positive outcome but you should seriously rethink buying a house together before being married.\n\nUnless she just wants to buy the house and have you pay rent or something it can get REAL messy if you two aren't married and you both own the house and then split up.",
            "This is a heartwarming result. Yeah, as smart and experienced as we are in our lives, there's always a chance that the other person has a perspective or motivation that you could never have guessed, and the only way to get through these conflicts and missteps is to provide a safe space for each other to talk and get the answers. Also why it's helpful to have that outside counselling perspective, too. Even as just a friend of couples, I've been able to see and then explain each partner's point of view to the other when they were too wound up to explain it clearly themselves. Best of luck to the two of you, and I hope your partner can find that happy, stable feeling safety with you in the future.",

            "I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re happy but while I\u2019m sure someone has probably said this, I\u2019ll say it myself as well...\n\nIf she lashes out when she is stressed and refuses to get help for that unhealthy coping strategy, then what is she going to do when kids come along? She can claim things will be different and the only difference is that she will either be dealing with the kids 24/7 or be dealing with them after work, which still means she is going to basically be \u201con the clock\u201d 24/7 while it is a baby and not yet in school. She will be stressed, so what is she going to do? Lash out at the child? You? What about the wedding? Is she going to be a complete \u201cbridezilla\u201d and throw a tantrum when something doesn\u2019t turn out exactly the way she imagined? What about when an important family member to her passed away? Is she just going to lash out for a year or more until she eventually deals with the grief on her own in this unhealthy way?\n\nYou were abused for 3 years. She needs to see a professional otherwise you are setting yourself up for a cycle that will continue for the rest of your life.\n\nPart of the \u201caction plan\u201d needs to be that she goes to therapy. You need to re-address this and explain that while you\u2019re sorry she misunderstood what you were saying, when you issued the \u201cultimatum\u201d you meant that if she starts this high stress job or really gets stressed out over ANYTHING to the point where she decides to use you as a verbal and/or physical punching bag, then you WILL have to re-evaluate this relationship due to you needing to put your mental health first, and YOUR mental health SHOULD come first cause guess what? You\u2019re the one who has to put up with that 24/7.",
            "I\u2019m gonna give you some of the best relationship advice I\u2019ve ever gotten - you don\u2019t need to trust her, you need to trust yourself enough to leave. Worrying about the future and how she may treat you does not serve you, so don\u2019t. Work through it, talk to her and encourage yourself and her to do the work required to keep your relationship healthy. If it doesn\u2019t work out, and it returns to a place of emotional abuse you have to trust yourself to know when it\u2019s time to through in the towel. Cast your worries aside. I\u2019m glad you guys had a good talk. When I saw your first post it was locked already but I was going to suggest just sitting down and telling her everything you told us."

I read a few books and I did some introspection. I have always liked girls. In hindsight, it is pretty obvious why I hated seeing my best friend with her boyfriend. haha. I brushed those feelings aside as just jealousy for how good their relationship was. Teenage me was pretty dumb.\n\nI also realized that my roommate was probably asexual. I have know her for a long time and she has not dated one single person. Never brought a person home. It made me feel hopeless about my feelings for her.\n\nI came out to her about a month ago. I had left one of my books laying around and she handed it back to me. I made a bad joke. I ended up explaining that I think I am bi. It was pretty awkward. She told me she was into girls but she thinks she is a demisexual and it takes her lot to form the emotional bond needed to be ready to have sex. I probably made a mess of the conversation. I thought there was no way she would for such bond with me.\n\nShe ended up asking me out while we were cooking dinner last week. I was pretty surprised honestly. It is scary and a bit awkward moving from being roommates to girlfriend. Scary as hell but even with all the uncertainty about if we could work. I feel incredibly comfortable around her. I can be myself and I know she won't judge me and she loves it.\n\nTLDR: I came out. she asked me out. starting a new relationship.",
