        "selftext": "Hi Relationships, I'll try to keep this short and blunt. Please don't judge before you've read the entire thing, I promise I'm not as awful as I sound in the title. \n\n\nI've been with Matthew for 3 years now, and we have a perfect relationship. I know everyone says that, but it really is true. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. I've only met his family a few times because they live pretty far away and my boyfriend had a huge falling out with his father a couple of years ago. They've since patched things up, but it's still not the same as it was. Matthew is not particularly close to his sister because she's 12 years younger than him and he doesn't see her that often. Of course he still loves and adores her, but they're not a very close family. Jessica has cancer and as a result has lost all of her hair. Matthew was devastated, obviously, and has been going to visit her more often. I have only seen her a few times since, because of work commitments. I have been down twice alone (without Matthew) to visit her in hospital. She\u2019s a lovely young girl and I\u2019m devastated for her and their family.\n\n\nJessica is home at the moment and Matthew's mum called last Friday and asked if we could go over there. Upon arrival Matthew's mum whipped out a pair of scissors and shavers and said that the whole family was shaving their heads for Jessica. My job is modelling. I have very thick, natural auburn hair that reaches my waist. It's one of the reasons that I'm fairly successful. It's one of the reasons I can afford to pay the bills. I couldn\u2019t model without my hair. So I respectfully and politely declined, telling them that it would be detrimental to my career. I don\u2019t have two jobs, I don\u2019t have a back-up, this is my job. It\u2019s my money maker. If I couldn\u2019t model, I don\u2019t know what I would do. \n\n\nMatthew immediately got angry, insisting that this is more important, and while I agree that sentimentally and emotionally this is far more important, I cannot afford to lose my hair. I have to think logically about this otherwise I won\u2019t have a roof over my head. Matthew\u2019s mum was very upset, and proceeded to tell Jessica that I wouldn\u2019t shave my hair because I am vain. I apologised to Jessica and explained my reasoning, and I went home. I have barely spoken to Matthew since it happened as he says he \u2018needs space to consider if he wants to be in this relationship.\u2019 I told him that I would do anything other than shave my head. I'll do a charity run, I'll raise tons of money, whatever I can possibly do, instead of shaving my head, but he won't listen. All he says is 'how can you put your looks and vanity over my cancer ridden sister'.\n\n\nDid I do the wrong thing? \n\ntl;dr my career is modelling and part of my success is due to my hair. My boyfriends younger sister has cancer so the family shaved their heads in support of her. I declined, and now everyone hates me.\n\n\nedit: a few people have asked so I'll copy+paste this from one of my replies: Matthew told me that Jessica is very upset and has told all of their family repeatedly that she hates me for having long hair and refusing to shave it for her. She's only 13 years old though, I have a feeling that the family are perhaps poisoning her view and of course she's going to be having a difficult time as it is. I can't hold any grudges against a young girl being in such an awful situation.\n\n\nEdit 2: I'm completely overwhelmed by the support here, so thank you a lot. I have read every comment and most of them are very helpful and make me feel a lot better. I am going to give it another few days and then I am going to speak with Matthew and his mum and Jessica. I'll be sure to post an update soon. Thank you again. \n\n\n*Edit 3: gosh I hate threads with a ton of updates when there's no real update but I feel the need to defend Matthew's family a little. They're not crazy people. They've always been absolutely lovely and kind and welcoming towards me. They were a normal, happy family before this happened. Their youngest member of the family, the innocent, sweet, vulnerable girl is dying and there's nothing they can do about it other than try to make her happy. Of course their view is clouded, of course they're not being rational. Matthew's mum has quit her job to spend more time with Jessica, they've spent every penny they have on gifts for her. I don't think they're crazy or bad people. They're in a world of hell and the only thing that makes it better is putting a smile on Jessica's face and me shaving my head would have done that. If they don't come to terms with it and start thinking clearly soon, then I will agree with everyone and I will call them crazy and run for the hills, but at the moment, I'm trying to be as supportive as I can to my boyfriend and his family whose hearts are all broken. Put yourselves in their shoes.*",

            "...What is wrong with these people? \n\n> All he says is 'how can you put your looks and vanity over my cancer ridden sister'\n\nNo. You are putting your career first. Moreover, how dare he use his kid sisters trauma as a way to guilt trip you. You sound incredibly supportive of this little girl already- not everyone would go see her in the hospital without their SO. ",
            "I think something that needs to be said here is that even if your job didn't depend on your hair - is that it's still *your hair* and it's completely understandable that you don't want to shave it, for any reason. Yeah, shaving your head is a nice gesture, but there are plenty of other ways to be supportive without making a massive change to your personal appearance that will take years and years to reverse, as your hair is so long. It's not vain to be happy with the way you look and not to want to change it... Especially when the reason for changing it is \"emotional support\", which can be achieved in many other ways. ",
            "A person can be supportive in more ways than just shaving their head. If they're truly angry simply because you wouldn't do this, they're in the wrong. ",
            "So I just created this account to say this.\n\nI was a model. I had long red hair to my waist and it paid the bills, and it paid them really fucking well. There is no way in hell I would have shaved my head on a whim, and even less chance I'd do it because my boyfriend's sister got cancer so his family made me. \n\nLet's pretend you shaved your head. Which one of them would be footing the bills for the next 2-3 years until you got your look back? Or the fact that you're worth less at 25 as a model so you'll *never* make that money back? Or deal with you being dropped by your agency (assuming you have one) because you went and did that without their ok? This isn't vanity, this is basic survival. \n\nAnd then we'll get on to the week or month after, after the euphoria and 'we're in this together' shit has died down and suddenly your boyfriend may not find you as sexy because he went for a longhaired redhead rather than a shaved headed woman (I'm not saying it's inevitable, but it's a definite possibility). \n\nSo you've shaved your head, the girl's cancer isn't impacted in any way. A month later you're broke and your boyfriend's being a bit weird with you, you're losing contact with your friends in the industry because you get less bookings and spend less time with them and more time desperately trying to find another job.\n\nFuck all that.\n\nEven without all of those things, you have bodily autonomy. It's your body. You choose if you grow/shave/dye/whatever your hair. Trying to force you into it is a serious display of ownership or entitlement. \n\nI'm so pissed off for you. The fact that he even tries to frame it as vanity rather than a completely unreasonable request shows how little he values your 1) bodily autonomy, 2) career, 3) sense of self. Maybe it is time for you to figure out if you want to be with him. \n",
            "Even if your hair didn't have a huge influence on your career it's not fair to force that on anyone. It's like saying you need to gain weight in order to support someone with a thyroid problem. Shaving your head isn't going to make her cancer go away and it'll overall not affect her sense of self-esteem because she's going to see people with long hair every day anyway.",
            "You don't sound horrible from the title. You sound like a woman who knows her boundaries.\n\nI would take a long, hard look at his family. From my own experience with an abusive family I'm seeing several red flags:\n\n> Upon arrival Matthew's mum whipped out a pair of scissors and shavers and said that the whole family was shaving their heads for Jessica.\n\nYou're not your own person to them. If they saw you as your own person, they would've made it clear on the phone and asked if you wanted to join in.\n\n> My job is modelling.\n\nThey don't care what you do and how you make your way through life.\n\n> Matthew immediately got angry, insisting that this is more important, and while I agree that sentimentally and emotionally this is far more important\n\nNo, this is not more important in ANY WAY. I bet you it wasn't even his sister's idea. This is just an attention grab likely spurred by the parents.\n\n> proceeded to tell Jessica that I wouldn\u2019t shave my hair because I am vain. \n\nGuilting and shaming you into doing something you don't/can't/shouldn't want to do.\n\nThis is likely not the first time any of these issues have come. I would honestly dip before the red flags started getting redder and more abusive.\n\nETA: With your boyfriend's reaction I would bet $100 that they've been trying to poison him towards you and this was a test that you \"failed\".",
            "That doesn't sound awful - it sounds reasonable and normal.\n\nI totally disagree that \"sentimentally and emotionally this is far more important\" than your job.  Shaving your head is a sign of solidarity, but it will do absolutely nothing to change the outcome for his sister so it makes no sense at all to give up your livelihood for it.  It's not like Matthew's family is going to step in and financially support you until you can work again.\n\nI think you also should recognize that no reasonable person would expect you to have a role in this struggle.  You're the brother's girlfriend of 3 years - not part of the family, and not morally obligated to be involved at all.  (Even if you were married into the family it wouldn't make you obligated to make major sacrifices for his sister.)  I'm sure you'd find that if you had cancer and wanted the sister to shave her head, Matthew and his family would have no problem appreciating that they are not obligated to help you.\n\nDon't even consider doing this OP, and beware of Matthew and his family - normal people don't think like this.",

            "Shaving your head for someone who has cancer is a personal decision. Honestly, I would only do it if my daughter had cancer and it would make her feel more confident. Your SO is allowed to request space and feel however it is he wants, but don't feel bad for one second. I think your SO and his family are *really* being out of line. Just remember that they are going through a lot of emotions with this cancer diagnosis and hopefully it's just a matter of not being able to think straight. Otherwise, I would not want to ever be apart of this family. This should not be a demand. ",
            "[deleted]",
            "If you shave your head for someone it's because you strongly want to, not because you are being pressured into it. Also they way they sprung it on you was a bit strange. It's a personal decision. The fact that you depend on your hair for a living makes it even more acceptable for you not to do it. You've offered to help in other ways that show support. This is one of the most extreme and it's wrong for them to push you and make you feel bad after you politely explained why you couldn't. Your boyfriend shouldn't leave you for this and if he does, then maybe it's for the best.  Good luck!!",
            "I wouldn't fall asleep around this guy. Wouldn't be surprised if he decided to shave your head while asleep. \n\n\nOh. And run. Run fast. ",
            "They are completely in the wrong. Not only have you explained your reasoning for your decline, but it's also a valid reason, and they turn around and profess it's your vanity to try and guilt you? \n\nThis is unacceptable.\n\nFurthermore, where was the memo from his sister that she wanted everyone to shave their heads for her? \n\nThere are better ways to show support than just shaving your head, and you've offered to do, in my opinion, things far more helpful to the cause, that also helps other cancer sufferers.\n\nYour boyfriend is entitled to his space, but is in no way entitled to his anger of your actions. Don't feel bad for a second, your hair is your career. \n\nI'm sure his sister much better appreciates your personal alone visits, than everyone walking around with a skinhead for her.",
            "It sounds like they didn't understand the full consequences for your career. Did you make this clear? Maybe try to point out how important this is for you to be successful.\n\nPersonally I believe it should also be acceptable to not shave your head because you just don't want to. It should be a personal decision and I doubt it would make the sister feel better if she would know you got pressured into it.",
            "Model here. OP is neglecting to mention that it won't just \"cost her some jobs\", she will literally get fired. Even completely top models will get in insane amounts of trouble for this. OP, try mentioning that your agency will drop you and you will probably get partially blacklisted. (Agencies talk to each other, bookers float around) Is your BF comfortable supporting you financially for the rest of your life? Most models use the money they make in the short term to start a business, invest etc.  Shaving your head will literally end this. \n\n\nPS not to sound creepy but I'm pretty sure I know who you are. If you're doing shows in NYC this season I'll come over and chat! ",
            "You haven't done anything wrong. Your boyfriend and his family are emotionally distraught and lashing out. Give him space, but don't feel guilty, and don't tolerate indefinite verbal abuse over your decision. ",
            "As a woman that had long hair and lost it to cancer...I absolutely said NO when people asked about shaving their heads for me. Losing my hair was the least of my worries. You shaving your head is sweet but it's not like you're able to take the chemo for me.  I guess I kinda understand the sentiment behind it for parents and siblings in the house but others? \n\nWith that said, obviously I think your SO and his family are WAY out of line. Way!!!  I agree with the person above that said you get to control your body. When anyone else tries to control your body or actions that is a red flag. ",
            "Fuck this entire family.  Your BF is a tool.",
            "You know what? When I first saw your post and didn't even know about the modelling angle, I was still thinking 'that's quite the douchey thing to do, expect someone to just be willing to shave their head for someone else'. So let's take that out of the equation. I think you're WELL within your right to say no, irrespective of your career choice, and how dare they assume that your life choices are forfeit just because they're having a shitty time?! It's not like you're not helping out or there for the family in other ways. Great logic - let's all be even more miserable than we already are. Shaving one's head in solidarity should be a decision made by someone who has came up with that idea themselves, not had it forced on them. \n\nThey sound shitty. Really shitty. Okay, she has cancer - that's really sad and it honestly does suck when it hits people that young. But fuck off, no one gets a free pass to be horrible and self-entitled, illness or not. \n\nYour relationship may not be salvageable on this one - even if he has doubts about the legitimacy of asking you to shave your head, he's got his entire family (including his ill sister) poisoning him here. It's a really shitty situation to be in, and I don't see it resolving itself easily. He needs to recognise (and quickly) how inappropriate their demand was, and work to patch things up with you and his family. I just don't see him doing that.  ",
            "Years and years ago, I had waist length hair. You wouldn't believe how many people told me that I should cut it off and donate it, and when I declined, told me I was being selfish. \n\nYour boyfriend and his family are out of line. I can't really blame the sister too much since she's 13 and probably experiencing a huge and scary range of emotions right now. I also don't doubt that her family is harping on about how \"awful\" you're being. \n\nI think you're entirely in the right to decline to shave your hair off. It's a huge part of your career, and frankly even if you didn't have a modeling job it would still be entirely OK to not shave it off. \n\nHopefully they wake up and realize how ridiculous they're being. I'm sure everyone is scared and upset right now but it's no excuse to take it out on you.",
            "I usually tend to disagree with r/relationships but ,  what the hell is up with them? \n\n* She is not part of your family\n\n* Shaving your hair changes nothing for the girl and cant help her at all\n\n* It will wreck your career.\n\n* Its immoral to force you into anything you dont want to do\n\n* They (including your boyfriend) are a family of narcissists. They raised a spoiled brat. Yes i do understand she has cancer, but so do other people and other people have other issues as well. Life is tough, that is a harsh reality. The girl will probably get good one day and have long ass hair. That doesnt change the fact that she is filled with jealousy and will continue and it doesnt change the fact that the family is putting her on pedestal and wish to force you on something that can actually ruin your life.\n\nMore over, if the kid doesnt make it, you will be hated, a lot, by them.\n\nMy suggestion? Nope the fuck out of there, asap. In the end it will not even be worth it to bother with them.\n\nAsk yourself, am i going to marry this person? If the answer is yes, then ask yourself this: Will i be able to put up with shit like this from their family? If the answer is yes then see what you can do. If the answer is no on first question keep them away.\n\nGood luck girl, hope you do well on your career.",
            "Considering it's your career, they basically want you to change your life 180 degrees simply out of respect. That's too much to ask. And if your BF doesn't come to terms with it, then you also should think whether \"you want to be in this relationship\". Your life choices and career should be as important to him as his sister's health. If he considers your job \"vanity\", it's quite disrespectful to be honest.\n\nI suggest you offer them a sizable alternative. Maybe provide care for the child on your off-work days. Obtain medical supplies for her, I dunno. If they won't listen, there is only one thing - wait and hope they understand.\n\nEdit: With how they presented it to the girl, it's too late to fix, and relationship with the family is probably irreparably broken. The only hope is that BF comes to his senses.",
            "You did the right thing.\n\nMatthew and the family are WAY out of line.\n\nWell done for sticking to your guns and not letting them push you around.\n\nThe power of gestures like shaving your head is there because people choose to make the sacrifice. It's pointless if someone bullied you into it.\n\nAnd like you said, you need your hair for your job. Even if you didn't, it's your damn hair, so it's your choice.  ",
            "Put your looks above his sister? \r  \rWhat would cutting your hair do? Make her feel just a little more special? This is your job, your lively hood. \r  \rIf cutting your hair would cure her of cancer, sure, do it. But the thing is, nothing would change except for you giving into his family's drama and malice nature. \r  \rYou need to separate yourself from these people. They are grieving and filled with bottled anger. They view your refusal to cut your hair as being unsupportive, and are misplacing a lot of that anger on you. \r  \rAn SO should never ask the other to give up their livelihood without fully discussing the future, and what they hope to accomplish.

A few of my friends cut their hair when I was diagnosed (not shaved, but short), and while I appreciated it, it didnt make me any less bald.

It's basically saying \"we're in this together!\" Forcing someone to shave their head defeats the whole purpose. For the actual cancer patients, it gives them little comfort as the hard part is the actual chemo therapy, losing your hair is normally just an unfortunate side effect. And your job is modelling, you would likely get fired instantly if you shave your head, this shouldn't even be an issue.\n\nYour boyfriend's family is way out line on this.",
            "Methinks there is a reason he has had fallings out with them before. They are drama queens and this situation is ridiculous. My father has cancer, and while I would consider it 'sweet' for people to empathize with him by shaving their heads, I would much rather they visit him in the hospital, or call him up to chat. This little girl is 13 years old, just beginning to develop, and is feeling insecure. And instead of supporting her and loving her, they are demanding everyone near her shave their head so that she won't have to 'hate them,' for having hair. That is unhealthy, and is clearly only upsetting her more.\n\nWhat's more, is they *ambushed you*. They didn't even warn you they were going to ask you to drastically change your appearance. It almost sounds like they were specifically targeting you. \n\nIMO, your boyfriend is immature and disrespectful. His family are immature and selfish.

Yes, they are under a lot of emotional stress - but the way that a person reacts when they are under stress is very important.  This is why you date someone for a long time.

There is nothing that does that help me, because they have chosen to do it, I didnt have a choice. \n\nI had been growing out my hair for the past few years and when I watched it come out in chunks it tore me apart mentally, Even fighting cancer 2 years later I still think losing my hair that first time was one of the worse things I went through. I don't know how someone CHOSING to cut their hair off should help me deal with the fact that I am being forced to lose my hair. \n\nShaving your head is not going to help that little girl in anyway. The fact is that all those family members who had the choice are going to have their hair growing back the second it's cut, and that little girl is going to be bald till she gets a different chemo that will allow her hair to grow or she goes into remission. \n\nShaving your head when someone you know gets cancer is just this stupid idea that keeps getting perpetuated to the point that people think thats what you are supposed to do. And I think if most people actually stopped and thought about it they would realize how silly it is.\n\nGood luck OP. ",

It doesn't matter if it involved your career or not, if you didn't want to do it, it was wrong of them to assume, pressure, and finally guilt you about it.\n\nFor women, shaving your head means a lot more than it does for men. Think about why it's such a big deal at events like St. Baldrics when a woman decides to do it. It's part of our gender identity and for a lot of women it's one of their most well-liked features. I know for me, my hair is a part of me. If I got cancer, it would be something I would grieve over. That is a normal reaction. \n\nI think it's completely selfish of the family to think that you should just cut it off because your boyfriend's sister (who you don't seem that close to) has cancer. \n\nI'm sorry that your boyfriend has put you in this situation. I think you need to reach out to him and say that just because you don't want to shave your head doesn't mean you don't support him, his sister, or his family. I would try to do something else that can show your support. Maybe cook them dinner so they don't have to worry about what to eat for a night or taking her to get a manicure or something else that might make her feel girly.

She can understand that. I wouldn't go into the details of how it is unreasonable in general to expect it, she's clearly been influenced by her crazy unreasonable family and has enough to worry about herself.",

If your BF seriously \"needs space to consider if he wants to be in this relationship\"-that is just ridiculous, and I would carefully consider moving forward in this relationship if he's willing to throw it all away over one stupid thing that shouldn't even be an issue. He of all people should understand why you can't shave your head. Maybe they are just taking out their frustrations on you, but to that degree? That is all just so unfair of them. You 100% did the right thing, I am sympathetic to their situation, but why should you have to shave your head? None of them really HAVE to do it either. It is their choice to do so, just as it is your choice not to do so.",

I have a sister and I don't think it would do it either, I see that it has value but it does not make her hair grow faster and it won't cure her; so why should you do something that drastic?

He is completely out of line, cancer is difficult I've lost my 4 grandparents and auntie to cancer, I know what it is like but never during our entire times dealing with it we expected to make people visiting shave their heads or something weird like that. \n\nAs an immediate family, they can do whatever they want.

He and his family are showing their true colors right now, and they aren't pretty. What they are asking goes beyond supererogatory and into the realm of complete madness. It would be one thing if you were a celebrity and didn't have to worry about getting jobs because of your hair, but you aren't. Your hair represents an investment of many years in your career. What they are asking for is like demanding that an engineer get a lobotomy in solidarity with their child who got a TBI. Its just crazy.\n",

Also, it takes for-fucking-ever to grow it out that long.\n\nBtw, what exactly was your boyfriend's plan for your career after you'd shaved your head? Paying your bills?

            "My TL;DR, is that I would give them all space for a while, and let emotions cool on all fronts. They're likely grieving and want someone, anything, to direct the emotions at. You just got to be it. Also suggesting you see about getting insurance on your hair.  \n    \nLikely, if they know your career and all, they know that it would be too much to ask you to endanger your career by doing so, but would have been impolite not to see if you wanted to as well. Your looks are your qualifier for you job. They likely knew this ahead of time, and rather than taking your decline with grace, they irrationally decided that you'd bend to them instead. In addition, I'd talk to a lawyer about getting insurance on your hair, not just for your career, but just in case someone decides to \"prove a point\" while they're emotionally compromised. Speak with your agent or manager. Also maybe let your agent or manager know what's up so at least there's record. Even if you were married, they still can't demand you to cut off all of your hair any more than they could ask you to donate tissue. I feel a little bad saying this, but I think the focus on shaving-for-support is a little overblown when someone could choose from a number of options to show their support.    \nI'd love to know, out of curiosity, how shaving went for the rest of them.  \n  \nIn another, you're right. Jessica is 13 and facing a difficult medical problem. If she's indeed upset, let her be. It's not something most people can deal with and especially for a tween/teen who doesn't have other life experiences to compare this too. Her family is also grieving of sorts, but being adults, should be able to respect another human being's decision about their body.  \n  \nI suggest backing off, but maybe not breaking up, maybe writing down a date or milestone for yourself to re-think everything. Maybe it's emotion of the moment, maybe it's not going to pass easy. If in one or two months they're still having a fit over you not removing your hair, then maybe it's time to walk away. Back off, send cards, music/app store gift cards, or games, or other things that will let Jessica know you are thinking of her, but back off and let the family work through their emotions. Give Matthew time to decide what he feels. You are not in the wrong, but if he feels this is intrinsic to feeling supported, then let him walk away. If he cools and apologizes, and only if he apologizes sincerely, for the demands, would I continue the relationship. You are getting to see a very nasty side, decide what you will with it.   ",

This is not rational thinking and the fact that your boyfriend knows your career is modeling and still chooses to be angry with you for not shaving your head says A LOT about how he views you and your chosen career.  To me it says he doesn't think that you or your career are important.  I know you love him and would do just about anything for him but this behavior of his and his family is completely unacceptable.  You offered other alternatives to doing this and he chose to throw his sick sister in your face instead.

Just imagine how he's going to react to the next thing you won't do because of your career or something you may feel strongly about.

When you plan a wedding, is Matthew going to get sulky every time you disagree with him? If you don't put his family first and in front of yourself, are you going to get attacked and called names?\n\nCancer sucks. No one is going to argue that. When horrible things happen, we all say and do horrible things. But how they handle this situation is going to say a lot about how they'll handle hard times in the future.

He doesnt respect you.\n\nThey are all just being fucking stupid.\n\nThey are effectively asking you to quit your job and career as a pointless gesture of solidarity.",
            "So basically they strongly believe in their religion and want you to convert. And arguments like \"but it hurts my career\" have no effect, because such things are not covered in their bible...\n\nI think you need to realize that you may need to decide between your career and this relationship. And if it really comes to that, I hope you will choose your career, because who knows what pops up next in their bible!",

They wouldn't want to be, I don't know, hypocrites? \n\nAnyway - telling family to go fuck themselves is rarely productive long term, though sometimes needed.   Offer to cut a few inches off as a symbolic show of support without screwing your career.  If they are still dicks, still show support by raising money for the kid, but keep a distance. \n\n",
            "They completely blind sided you with that one! The fuck is that shit about? \n\nI think you need to make it clear you need time to reevaluate the relationship yourself. He's guilting you and even trying to use the relationship as a threat to manipulate you! That's insane! ",
            "You've explained clearly and really succinctly why it's kind of ridiculous to expect you to even consider shaving your head.\n\nConsidering Matthew's reaction, is it possibly this is exposing some disapproval of your career?

            "I'm a bit of a cynic/realist so I think shaving your head does fuck all for cancer \"solidarity\" or whatever unless you're donating your hair to a reputable wig charity. All it does is make the person going bald from chemo feel less alone, but they still have cancer. Your suggestion of fundraising was an awesome counter-compromise because it lets your bfs sister know you care and creates actual impact on cancer research. \n\nI'm sorry your bfs family don't see the audacity of their request. Just because little sister has cancer doesn't mean all logic has to fuck off out the window.",
            "You're absolutely not wrong. \n\nA couple people have mentioned getting the sister a nice wig -- I think that could be a great idea, depending in how open the family is to it. Maybe bring several wigs over to her house and help her try them on, give her beauty advice and tell her she looks cool, kind of in a sister-ly way. She could probably use a boost like that right now, and it might help them see you do care. ",
            "This request is ridiculous, I could see some merit to it if by shaving your head it would help cure her cancer but that's just not the case. Shaving ones head in support of a cancer victim should be done voluntarily and without any kind of pressure, if the women in that girl's family want to shave their heads that's their choice.\n\nDon't give in into pressure, dump your boyfriend if he doesn't support you. Your life will be hell with him and his family anyway with his meddling mother.  ",
            "Yeah, you're fine. They're going through something tragic right now and might act crazy. You did nothing wrong. You're young and likely beautiful, so if this doesn't work out, move on, write some poetry, make a record about it and enjoy life. ",
            "I don't normally post when there's already tons of replies saying the same thing but I feel like this has to be reiterated - you are not a horrible person, do not let them pressure you into doing this, you are not in the wrong here. Even if your job didn't involve your hair, expecting you to shave your head and then guilt tripping you about rightly refusing is not on!",

            "It sounds to me as if your boyfriend is having a hard time dealing with a terrible situation. Taking it out on you isn't a great solution, but nobody thinks rationally when their sister is potentially dying of cancer. In the time it takes for him to \"decide\", why don't you run a 5k or take up donations for whatever cancer she has? Show him and his family that you love and support them, even when they're going through a disaster. If that show of unconditional love and support doesn't phase him and he's still mad at you.... Maybe then think about if this is what you're prepared to live with?",
            "I feel there has to be a missing piece here. Do you live with Matthew? Does he support you, or could you literally survive on your own living entirely off your modeling career. \n\nI don't think that any support you receive from him (if you receive any at all) would put him or his family in the right, it would just help to make this same less batshit crazy.

            "Hold you ground. As you have stated they are all a bit emotional. Hopefully the guilt trip bullshit stops soon though. Might have to call him out if he keeps it up and remind him that shit doesn't help. You've offered other options to help and you seem to care quite a bit about him and his family. Hopefully this blows over for ya soon. Good luck op. ",

Shaving your head isn't the most important way to show support, in fact the idea of raising money with a run is more logically beneficial since it helps find an answer for cancer. \n\nI can tell you right now, your hair grows slowly after you shave it. I did some serious damage to mine and shaved my head 4 1/2 years ago, it's finally just below my collar bones at the longest.\n\nIt sounds like he isn't a very healthy person to date if he takes this side of things right away. I don't know where you're at with your feelings for him but if someone did this to me I wouldn't reconsider the relationship in total.\n\nYou didn't make the wrong choice, you made the choice that best fits your life and you should never feel guilty for setting boundaries.",

You didn't do anything wrong in the first place.  There is nothing wrong with supporting Jessica and doing something in her honor, but you can't compromise yourself.  Make sure you continue to take the high road.\n\nBut even if you do manage to take the high road and stay there, it is going to take your boyfriend and his family coming around.  This may all blow over, or it may not.\n\nJust remember that you can only control you, and you did the right thing here by not compromising your career and income unnecessarily.\n\nps - They don't respect your career, i.e. don't think it is legitimate at all.

You do not Owe her anything.  It is a beautiful gesture for those who are Able.   You are not refusing for your own vanity, you are refusing because you must.  If they bring it up again, tell them that you will cut your hair when they pay you ($ xx, xxx)(what you will lose in income in the time it takes to grow back), so that you are able to make rent and not have 50k of credit card debt by the time you two are ready for marriage. \n\n...And as for the girl being angry at you for having hair when she can't?  Does she also hate Bill Gates for having money?  Does she hate her mother for being older and more experienced?  Does she hate newborns for, most likely, having more years left on this earth?  Does she hate her brother for having male parts that she will never be able to have?  Does she demand that he cut them off?\n\n\"I can't have cake, then everyone should starve!\"  I can understand the *feeling*, especially considering her possible feelings of helplessness due to the situation, but it is not something to be acted upon, or acknowledged as anything other than human nature of greed and envy, and to be dismissed just as quickly as such.  So, she is only 13(?)... it is a lesson that should be learned whether she has 1 more, or 100 more years on this earth.",

What is *wrong* with them?\n\nYour boyfriend does not value or support what you are doing with your life and has a frankly astounding lack of empathy for you.\n\nWhen I was a teenager I cut my waist-length hair chin length for my girlfriend. I got enjoyment out of it too, but by the time I chose to grow it back out--from chin length, not scalp--it took me two years to reach past my shoulders. Now it's to the small of my back. Oh, and believe you me, the awkward in-between phase was awkward. My two little sisters struggle to grow theirs and openly show jealousy, the younger of which works in hospitality and so her appearance directly impacts her job. Me? I could consider myself lucky, I guess, that my awkward phase went unattended because I was home sick for much of it (and all I wanted was to get better, which didn't seem possible at the time, I didn't give a fuck how my hair looked...and for the record I thought my sisters prettier than me).\n\nYou did nothing wrong. Personally I can't imagine getting over what your boyfriend said to you if my partner said something similar to me.

This is obviously a hard time for all of them so you're showing a lot of maturity by trying to talk it out reasonably with unreasonable folks.  But throwing tantrums and trying to guilt you into violating your limits to accommodate their requests is wrong.

This whole everybody shaves their head when a person gets cancer trend is weird and it doesn't help anybody. No one asks you to cut off a limb when a family member returns from war disfigured.

I would leave him, but it's whatever you want to do I guess. This will be part of your relationship for the rest of your life with him. This will always be there. They have related it to his little sisters CANCER. This will never go away and everyone is displacing their grief for the child with cancer onto your hair. Which is really stupid.

To expect someone to shave their head for a cause? No that's not realistic.\n\nYou're not choosing your looks over your boyfriend's sister, you're choosing your career, how you get bills paid. If you worked as a manager for a business company, where you would be expected to have an ordinary haircut, hair color, etc., and being bald would not be acceptable (unless you had health issues yourself), this is the same situation, you would have to refuse. You're expected, in your profession, to have hair.\n\nI don't know if it's because her family is messed up, or what, but if the sister is really resentful of you for not shaving your head, maybe it's because she's jealous. It's sad that she has cancer, and you know that if it hadn't been for your job you probably would have done it, but she needs to understand that it's not normal to hold resentment for someone declining to make a huge change to their bodies like this.\n\nIf they all got tattoos on their bodies to show support, and someone had sensitive skin and couldn't get a tattoo, would they have the same reaction?",
            "Nope, fuck them. It's your body. Even if you were a body-builder or a janitor or whatever, you have the right to not cut your hair.

I could not and would not shave my head even if it was someone in my family who got cancer. In fact my grandfather had cancer last year and went through several rounds of radiation. I did not shave my head for him when he lost his hair and he never asked anyone (2 kids, 9 grandkids, 15 great grandkids) to do that. We gave emotional support and my mom moved in with her parents so she could take him to his treatments as my grandmother does not drive. \n\nI am all for running in a charity in her honor. If his family, and more importantly your SO cannot see that it's not feasible for your professional career to do that, then you need to point out what you have done and are willing to do that does not sacrifice your way of keeping a roof over your head. The fact he doesn't know if he could stay in a relationship over this is a huge red flag to me, ESPECIALLY since you are not even engaged. That is a lot of pressure on someone who isn't related and they should not have sprung that on you out of nowhere. You didn't have time to process and they shouldn't demand it of you.",

It doesn't count if you have to force someone to shave their head, first off, and second off it's not like your boyfriend and his family are going to pay your bills.\n\nIf this is how he wants to be, then cut him loose.

Yeah it is, I fucking love my hair and I think I would look terrible without it. 100% vanity. And even in that case, saying \"no\" isn't a bad thing. It's perfectly fine and understandable. \n\nYou don't have to justify yourself. That is an awful lot to ask of a person and his mother was very presumptuous to pull out the shears without warning.

How does it make sense for you to throw away your income? How does that benefit anyone? To shave your head would be like quitting your job without anything lined up after. What is the sense in that? How dare they ask you to risk your *income* over this? Is anybody else taking that risk? No? Just you? How is that reasonable or fair? It's not! Income aside, what if you genuinely lover your job and don't want to lose it? Do they even care about that?\n\nIf your boyfriend cannot see the logic in this and breaks up with you over it, then he's throwing away a perfectly good thing for a dumb reasons. He'll regret it later - you're just going to have to trust me on that, he will regret it. I hope, though, that he can calm down and see reason before that happens. You sound like a very reasonable, thoughtful, and compassionate person and have no need to feel guilt. You've done nothing wrong here.",
            "This is something that would be an amazing gesture to offer, but is truly bizarre to demand. In your case cutting your hair would cause you to lose your job, so it's even more outrageous to demand.\n\nOn the other hand, they're all going through a very tough time; cancer can be very scary for the patient and the family, particularly when the patient is a kid. It's probably brought out some nasty feelings in them that made them snap at you like this.\n\nIf you want to give them another chance, take the high road and send a thoughtful letter clarifying you really care for Jessica, that you're so sorry she had to lose her hair. Explain that you really wish you could join her but your career honestly *requires* you to keep it.\n\nIf her family refuses to cut you some slack, I'd honestly just break up with your boyfriend and move on. It might be tough to do so because of what his family is going through, but you're not making a difference staying if they're fixated on resenting you.",
            "What his family is demanding is disgusting. You shaving your head does exactly nothing to help their child get better. And it would cause you to lose your source of income. And it would make you lose something you're, rightfully, very proud of. Your hair is incredibly long and it would take years to get it back to the length it's currently at. I think you need to walk away from this \"perfect\" relationship. You're a model, I'm sure you can find someone better.",

            "......i wouldnt shave my head even if it wasnt my livelihood. Since when is it a goddamn rule to shave your head if you know someone with cancer? if you do it, good for you, nice show of solidarity. If you dont, thats your choise.\n\nYour first edit is actually super disgusting. No way a 13 year old would react that way. No way in hell, they are feeding her the hate. Maybe we're just seeing them in a bad light, but your boyfriend and his family sound like complete and utter douchebags.",
            "Matthew and his family are being blinded by their grief. There's no way normal people would make this an issue right?",
            "These people are not in their right mind.  But they are using you as a whipping post, misplacing their anger and pain at the girl's cancer towards you.  Plus they sound pretty screwy.  I don't care if your hair is your livelihood it is completely unreasonable to ask someone to shave their head.  Its just crazy.",
            "I was on your side from the title-- it's your hair. And then when you mentioned it was how you pay the bills, *and* it's waist-length (which obviously would take several years to grow back), there is no way you are in the wrong here. ",

            "I don't really see how shaving your head can help a girl with cancer.  I guess it may show support/solidarity, but what happens when all of your hair and the family's hair grows back (within weeks) while the girl remains sick and bald?  You're the only reasonable one here.",
            "I was the 12 year old that had cancer in that situation... a little over ten years ago. It was very encouraging to have people shave their heads in support of my illness. That being said, I would have never expected that of anyone, or been offended by their decision if they didnt. I think only one female was a part of the whole ordeal and shaved her head. \n\nI obviously dont know the family dynamic as well, but I would recommend talking to his sister to tell her why you didn't shave your head if she is upset... however I can't see that she would be upset unless her family convinced her she should be.\n\nNo, you did not do the wrong thing in this situation. It is selfish, unreasonable, and downright rude to expect that from everybody, especially in your case since your hair is a big part of your professional life. But maybe that's just my opinion. ",

        "selftext": "Update to my earlier posts here https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3fwuub/update_i24m_caught_my_sister26f_trying_to_steal_a/\n\n\nAfter going through all the comments(thanks for the advice!) I decided to send my mother an email letting her know that I will absolutely not be paying for the new place she made plans to move to, and that I will stop paying her rent all together. I told her that she clearly does not respect me or the work I put in in order for me to be in a position to give her the money that I do. I also told her that I would not be financially supporting her in any way. \n\nA few hours after I sent the email my phone starts blowing up. Calls over and over again. I still really didn't want to talk to her so I ignored them all. A little while later I get a call from my friend Dave, except when I answer the phone it's my mom. I found out later from Dave that she showed up at the bike shop he works at and made up some story about story about her locking her purse with her phone and keys in the car and needing to call me for a ride. \nShe immediately goes off on me about how ungrateful I am and that she is disgusted by the email I sent etc. She told me that it's my \"duty\" to make sure she is well cared for and comfortable, as she is the reason I'm here in the first place. The worst part was when she told me that if she knew I was going to end up this way that she wouldn't have put her life on hold for the last 2 decades in order to have me, and that I cost her her job and my dad and a bunch her her life plans. I couldn't even get a word in with all her yelling. The last thing she said was something along the lines of \"you need to have a come to jesus moment and realize how much you are hurting your mother. I have already packed up most of my stuff and have spent a ton of time setting this move up. I expect the $8500 before the weekend is over in a cashiers check so let me know when you have it.\" and then she hung up. \nI don't think I have even been so mad in my entire life. She pretty much just told me that I need to make up for everything she missed out on in order to have me by giving her money and making sure she's taken care of. \nI called her back and she tried to start talking and I don't remember exactly what I said because I was so angry but I basically told her to shut the fuck up and let me talk(but with more swearing and yelling) I'm usually pretty calm and would never swear at my mom(I would never even swear near her) and I know I shouldn't have said that but I wasn't thinking straight. I told her she better find another place to live or pay her rent herself because she wasn't getting another dime from me.\nI turned my phone off after that because I didn't want to deal with anymore calls or texts. I eventually needed to use my phone so I turned it back on and just blocked her number. I saw that I had some calls/messages from her but I didn't want to look at them.\n\nThis morning I got a call from the front desk at my building telling me that my mom had tried get up to my room, but I had already told the elevator staff/security to take her off my guest list. Apparently she caused quite the fuss when they wouldn't let her up. \nShe is blocked on my phone now so I haven't heard from her today yet, but I expect her to blow up on me again for what happened this morning. \n\nI think she's probably in denial and thinks that I will cave and pay for her new place. I'm worried about what she's going to do when the deadline for her to pay for her new place comes up and I refuse to give her any money. The move in date is pretty soon and I'm sure she has to pay it pretty soon, I'm actually surprised she hasn't had to pay already. So that's going to cause a massive shitstorm. I'm really really worried about what she's going to do.\n\nThanks again for all the advice! \n\n\nTLDR: \nMom showed up at friends work and used his phone to call me because I wasn't answering her.\nYells at me about not doing my duty and how I owe it her to take care of her because I basically ruined her life. \nSays I have to give her rent check by the end of the weekend.\nTell her she isn't getting a dime from me and hang up\nShe tries to get in my building but isn't allowed.\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!",

It may not hurt now but when you find yourself in a dark place, on a bad day, or just a shit moment, it could really takes its toll. Talking to someone (which I am assuming you can afford) will really help you move past the insanity of your mom and sister, and also strengthen your resolve for no contact.\n\nDo not be afraid to dump professionals who say you should contact your mother again.

However, everything kind of came to a head last week when Gavin started telling other people on the team that a few of us, including me, were making his wife feel awkward. I think some of the original commenters predicted this would happen, albeit in a slightly different way. He didn't tell me directly and I found out from the other people who had been accused.\n\nI then decided to talk to the CEO about Gavin. \\*I didn't mention Donna or her work quality\\* but I wanted his advice and input on whether I was making anyone uncomfortable. I also gave my side of the story, focusing on how the accusation dampened my morale and pointing out that I feel like outsider sometimes since most people in the company are old friends. Fortunately for me, he didn't see things the same way Gavin did and said he would speak to him.\n\nAfter the meeting, the CEO quietly took Donna off my projects and reassigned her something small and not really connected to the core business objectives to work on. He's also now interviewing someone from outside the friends and family circle to take on the lion's share of what Donna was originally assigned to do. Gavin has been told to provide more direct support for Donna, which he seems annoyed about but obviously isn't going to fight.\n\nTL;DR: I'm lucky my CEO is a wise dude. All in all I think this is a good and fair outcome for everyone, though things with Gavin and I will almost certainly get worse.\n\nThanks for all the advice in the original post.\n\nOMG thanks for the gold kind stranger!",

Small companies where people know each other well can get away with this, larger ones cannot. Your CEO has kind of papered over the problem for the time being, but it will come back in the future. You were expecting them to hire someone who could hit the ground running, but that kind of thing is often not possible in today's hot job market, someone like Donna may well have been the best they could get, or close. It might not even have been possible in any job market, depending on the nature of your work and how much of the necessary knowledge is unique to your own company. \n\nYou need to set expectations in the future that part of your formal job responsibilities will be training new people that come in.

Before you spend lots of money trying to recreate the night for new photos, make sure you call him up and talk to him on your own. \n\nIn the case that you do have to recreate them, I really don't see the shame in it.

However, as someone with crippling BDD and self-esteem issues I can understand your wife's reluctance to have pictures taken. If I see photos of myself that others have taken I have panic attacks and cry. I've hurt myself over pictures before and my recovery from self-esteem issues has been greatly damaged by viewing photos of myself that have been taken by others. In fact, my anxiety about appearing in photographs is so intense that I worry that I will be unable to marry my SO at all because I literally cannot cope with having my picture taken and being the focus of attention at something like my own wedding is my worst nightmare.\n\n\nThis being said, I am aware that this is not healthy and I'm seeking help. Your wife needs to do the same. By lying about this instead of speaking to you about it and managing to come to some sort of agreement (for example a few pictures of you both on the day under circumstances that would make her the least uncomfortable) your wife has broken your trust.

However, it's completely understandable that you're disappointed not to have any pictures of her from the day, and to be upset that she did this without letting you know. I think it's worth talking to her about it again and exploring her reasons and what she thinks about her appearance.\n\nIt's definitely not too much to ask your wife for a picture of her on her wedding day, but if her worry about being photographed is so severe that she can't even allow that then maybe there's something serious going on with her self-image.

Brilliant. \n\nShe paid to be excluded from the pictures. I echo the sentiment that others have, she needs to go to therapy, and honestly, you need to go with her. She needs to see that you are willing to go hand in hand with her and help her work on her issues and hey, odds are you have some issues too that could benefit from it, and you both could benefit from one of your first serious issues as a married couple. \n\nAnd then, then when the time is right and she can manage to do it, you need to do a little private session. Hire someone - or hey, some folks in here offered to do it. You find a wedding dress, or you do something like go to rent the runway and rent a white dress from there. And you have fun. An intimate private fun session. And from there, you tell her that //one// of those, has to be released to the family, made available. \n\nBecause down the road you are going to have kids(or maybe not), and god forbid something happens, you NEED something to remember her by visually. Do NOT, please do not be in my situation. I am so upset that no one took better care of the few pictures there were of my mother. I wish I had a picture of her to put on the staircase wall, so I //could// see for myself if I really do look like her or not. Because all I have is the word of others who haven't seen her in 31 years and my own 4 year olds memory is pretty much non-existent.\n\nAnd make sure to check with the friend and see if he succeeded in not getting pictures of her, or if he did''t and just didn't include them. Because I have two huge photo binders of pictures from my own wedding and I'm unintentionally in quite a few and friends took pictures too and sent me their good ones - hell, we framed three of them. ",
            ">  I wanted a picture of my wife to remember how she looked on that special day. Is that too much to ask?\n\nNot in the absolute it isn't; with the specific wife you have, it might be. That's the kind of question that should have been asked before the wedding. Now, what's done is done: you don't have pictures of your wife on your wedding. You'll just have to accept that fact.\n\nTo make her understand how upset this makes you, you could talk about how you both feel about pictures if you haven't already. To her, seeing pictures of her might make her uncomfortable and self-conscious and sad, and knowing people might be taking pictures of her might make her feel stressed. She might not realize that when you see a picture of her you don't see any of the flaws she sees, you see your wife that you love and it makes you feel happy and connected to her, and remember that time the picture was taken, and those feelings are *something you need*.\n\nTo some extent though you'll have to live with her feelings on the matter. For example, what if knowing she might have her picture taken on her special day had been stressful enough to mar or ruin the day for her ? That would have been bad too, so it might be for the best that it didn't happen. Again, should have been discussed beforehand, but there we are.\n\nAs far as putting the spilled milk back in the jug goes, while you cannot have any pictures of her on her wedding day you could still arrange to have other things to remember the day by - if it's the seeing your wife in the dress that matters, you could ask her to dress up just one more time for a private photoshoot just for you? If it's the togetherness, you could ask for permission to take some pictures of other newlywed events or activities you're engaging in?\n\nHow about other non-photographic alternatives - like a painting, or recordings, or making physical souvenirs together, whatever?\n\nAs for what to tell your family, I think it's OK if you just tell them the truth. If they already know she's camera-shy, just play it like an \"as you know\" thing and act like it's normal, which for her, it is. If they *don't* know, then they really need to know so this would be a good time to tell them. Because what will happen at future family events where people take pictures? Your family might respect your wife's wishes not to have pictures taken, or they might think it's unreasonable and refuse to do so, but that's a conversation you need to have BEFORE problems arise.",

            "As others have said, this incident seems indicative of way bigger issues than just not having these photos. If my fiancee did something like this, I would feel that the communication and trust upon which our relationship is predicated had been violated.\n\nOf course she knew it would be a big deal. Otherwise she would have told you ahead of time. She decided to ask for forgiveness rather than permission.\n\nShe may have issues that she needs to address personally, but from a relationship standpoint it's my opinion that you need couples counseling. Communication is key to a healthy relationship, and right now it doesn't seem like something that you are doing a good job of as a couple.",
            "OK sorry if im a little late to this but I think she might have what I have. She probably has BDD. Its a form of OCD and the doctor will usually confirm if you have it or not. Mine did atleast after a few appointments with him and a therapist. I literally would do this at my wedding. I hate when people take pics of me. \n\nListen please try not to get mad at her. I know its frustrating but if she does have BDD the last thing to help would be to get angry. She probably has EXTREME anxiety about all that stuff. Im an attractive, fit, young guy. WHen my anxiety is down I can see that, but 98% of the time Im worrying about my looks and can't deal with seeing myself. It's extremely hard to explain because deep down we know it's irrational. Yet the ocd somehow tricks our brain into feeling it anyways. Seriously girls have always had crushes on me and say Im hot yet for the life of me I cant admit to it nor do I feel comfortable having video or photos taken of me. \n\nBest advice is to go with her to a doctor and see if she has BDD. IF she does you can either take the medicine route (usually they put you on prozac) or try to deal with it naturally and overtime. The later requires more time but really helps cope with the anxiety whereas the medicine will just help eliminate it using the drugs inside. Im not a big medicine guy so I decided to take the natural route and so far it's been pretty good. I still get nervous and anxious but Its gotten a lot better. \n\nI really hope she can get help because it really makes life a living hell when you don't like your own appearance. ",

His claim was that even though you live in the moment; because of all the rush the actual day is very hectic and goes by so quickly you need photos to look back on. And.... He was right. We spent the most money on photography and it was worth every penny because they weren't just some kids snapping pictures with their camera phones. They'd pose you and take the best angles and event be candid ones were superb! I was blown away at looking through the album and not just liking one or two but LOVING every photo of me in it because I was so genuinely happy and actually quiet lovely. \nI suggest she put on her gown and you guys go and take at least a few posed ones.

Her deceit seems to have been caused by conflicting anxieties over letting you down and being photographed.  She managed the situation so she could get her way and you wouldn't realize until it was too late.  That's the most damning interpretation.  However, consider if she had been docile.  You would have gotten your way and it would have been right because of what? Convention? Whether this was a plan conceived through pettiness or fear, you can be the ultimate judge because you're the only one here who knows her.  I wouldn't write off her anxiety because it is eccentric and obscure. I can't jump to conclusions about body dysmorphic disorder or self-esteem with the information you gave, though I suppose those are fair guesses. If you want to hash out this particular grievance, talk to her about why she has the feelings she has about photographs, and what both of your expectations are about being photographed in the future.  If you decide to appeal to her to change her mind about photographs, focus on positive personal reasons for why photographs of her are important to you.  You can also talk about why this deception occurred -whether she was afraid of you discovering the scope of her anxiety and not understanding or she didn't trust that you'd respect her wishes if she made them known, or some other reason-",

I managed to get her to therapy for a while, but she wasn't ready for it yet. A lot of people need to want to be helped before they can ask for help. You have a right to let your wife know that you are hurt by not having those photos, and by her secrecy. She owes you an explaination. But the thing is, she might not understand why herself. As her spouse, you need to help her work through the issue, and you have to accept that it night take time to figure out. ",
            "Oh my god that's awful.  I don't like getting my picture taken either- I made my husband find the photographer for our wedding and I just grinned and bore it for the pics I had to be in.  I didn't have a lot of individual shots with just me, it was more group things or me and my husband as a couple.\n\nI'd just tell people none of the photos came out, and let your wife explain.  That's not just shy, there's something wrong with her she needs to work through.",

I don't even have pictures of me on Facebook and I'd kill myself before I would ever take a selfie. I understand her very well actually. I wouldn't want any photos taken of me, not even on my wedding day or with my children. \nIt's just how I am wired and I've tried therapy but it doesn't help with this. It's just stuck in me. \nI understand you feel hurt and mad but you have to understand that this must also be very hard for her and I'm sure she feels guilty and bad being like this. Isnt it better to have a great memory then her being always worried that pictures are being taken of her on the wedding day? \nPeople don't seem to understand this. Other people don't like something else and this is mine. I'm actually happy to know there is someone else out there and that I'm not alone in this:/ ",

            "This reminds me of myself. I'm better about it than I used to be, but there are VERY few pictures of me (like, almost none) in high school and even in college thus far because I'm extremely insecure about my looks. It's more than understandable that you're upset about this, but I also sympathize with her; when someone has body dysmorphia that bad, their behavior can be extreme to the point of complete irrationality. I think the two of you ought to go to couples counseling and work this out. She needs to understand this isn't normal and is the byproduct of a serious psychological issue.",

Now if someone tries to take a picture of her, she has severe anxiety attacks. She can't stand having her picture taken anymore because of her past trauma. Perhaps there is something similar going on with your wife. Is she a trauma survivor? Has anything happened in her past that would explain this behavior? \n\n\n\nSorry to hear about this, I hope you guys resolve your issues.",
            "Oh who cares about the picture taking problem.  Have a picture taken now that she understands how you feel.  Whats 3 or 4 days.  Your wedding isn't the most special day of your life.  The most special day is every day after that when you get to be with them.  The wedding is just a symbol of all those other days.  Talk it out and get a picture now.  ",

What's done is done, so there is no going back, but a reconciliation is definitely required as she broke your trust pretty big time. Simply state that she should look into the issue with a therapist or whatever and move on.

I lost a loved one to depression and suicide, and one of the biggest red flags was that she did not want any part of herself to be seen and presumably judged by other people. Please get help. Please. I understand you feel hurt and betrayed, but this is something far more serious than hurt feelings. You can have another wedding when your wife feels better about herself.",

            "My oldest brother is extremely camera shy. He's hated having photos taken of him his whole life and my dad doesn't understand and tried to take his photo anyways for most of my brother's adult life. My brother did say, there was one day where photos were allowed and that was on his wedding day. He and his wife discussed it and agreed upon it beforehand. I understand how it could come as a surprise that she wouldn't want any photos of you together as a couple, but this is one of those things that has to be communicated first.\n\nI do feel that it wasn't fair of her not to communicate this arrangement with the photographer with you before the wedding and if it were me, I would be extremely angry also, but I am an extremely visual person and I feel a lot of emotion with images. Honestly, I don't know what I'd do because this is clear evidence of her putting her own needs first before even discussing them with you. This part angers me a lot.\n\nIt's not the fact that she doesn't like having her photo taken, it's the fact that she chose a decision that impacted your ability to look back on your shared wedding day. Wedding photos are pointless without both people in them. She took that away without remorse. It is a big deal.",
            "Ask the photographer privately if he captured her in any photos, and simply didn't give them to you. ",
            "Here's what you do: get over it. It's only as big a deal as you make it. So she didn't want pictures. You both have preferences. Hers are anti-picture, yours are pro-picture. You got your picture taken, she didnt. Win/win.\n\nThe fact that she didnt make her wishes known and bribed the photographer under the table is a bit troubling though. The fact that she didnt want to be in pictures AND tried to avoid discussion may indicate she simultaneously feels horrible about the way she looks and feels her own wishes are not worth anything. ",
            "Not a single other person brought a camera to the wedding? Regardless, the memory is what counts the most. ",
            "I would probably have done the same thing.  My mother used to take photos of me when I was a kid. If I did not smile well enough, she screamed at me. If my smile was still not good enough, she came over and pushed me, grabbed me, or punched me.  She would scream in my face \"SMILE! STOP RUINING THE PHOTO YOU SELFISH AND MANIPULATIVE BRAT!\"  If I did not take the \"perfect\" photo for her, she would push me or drag me or hit me out of rage at my having \"ruined\" her photo. I have no idea why she thought attacking me would make me smile better.  (She was mentally ill.)  \n\nMy point is, I don't like my photo being taken either.  And it is not for low self-esteem. Having my photo taken, especially when people say \"smile!\" makes me upset.  It reminds me of how my mother would react to me when I was not perfect-looking in one of her photos.\n\nYeah, I get that you are hurt. But you know your wedding is not just for you - it's for your wife too.  She wanted her special day to be happy. Maybe getting photos taken of her, for whatever reason (hopefully not for my same reason) makes her unhappy. Why should her day be unhappy to make you happy?\n\nYes, I know, you two are in a marriage and ideally there would be compromise, and ideally she would be willing to have photos of her taken for your sake.  \n\nI do not do this for people though.  I hate having my photo taken, and it upsets me too greatly to be worth it to me to have my photo taken just to make someone else happy, no matter who that someone else is. \n\nJust saying, I feel for your wife.  But sorry about your photos, that sucks.  ",
            "Have you considered she might be hiding something or from someone?",
            "I wouldn't be upset for that reason, but rather the fact that she didn't express it to you beforehand. *That* is the important thing you need to get out of this; the fact that she felt that there was something that she couldn't feel comfortable sharing with you, her partner in life.\n\nYou need to let her know that she needs to communicate these things. The camera anxiety problem is no where near as a big deal as being with someone who is afraid to share part of their life, including their problems. The good and the bad.",
            "wait what? I thought the photographer screwed up and took photos of her or something but this is just about you wanting pictures of somebody who doesn't want to be in a picture?\n\nget the fuck over it, jeesh.",

            "In my opinion even getting them recreated will still not be really great. Pictures (for me)bring up the memories. Every time I look at those recreated photos I'd think of the bad memory associated with why we had to get them redone. ",
            "She should have communicated her expectations to you.   It's all well and good that she should seek a counselor,  but at this point I would suggest couples counseling as well to start laying some real groundwork for you two. ",
            "What the heck was the point of a photographer.  I'd be pissed too. ",
            "There are two issues here: first, the fact that you don't have any wedding photos, and second, that your wife didn't talk to you before making this decision. You seem to be getting a lot of advice about the wedding photos issue, and it's not the important one. Let that part go, chalk it up to learning to compromise, maybe ask her to deal with the relatives asking for photos.\n\nThe part where your wife made this decision that would hurt you without talking to you about it first is what you have to address. Talk with your wife about which decisions you two want to make together, and which decisions you want to make separately. You need to be on the same page about this, or you will end up accidentally hurting each other. She didn't mean to hurt you by doing this- but she may hurt you again unless you help her to understand your expectations, and vice versa.\n\n(Examples of the sort of decisions I'm talking about- how much money is it ok to spend without talking to your wife? Is it ok to get a pet as a surprise if you two have been talking about it? How about career changes, what if one of you really needs to ragequit their job one day?)",
            "I haven't found a response to your continued question of getting an unwilling person into therapy.  I have been in therapy since I was 16 (29 now).  My husband is severally depressed and anxious as well.  It took a doctor telling him that his symptoms (tired, lack of motivation, headaches, etc.) were anxiety and depression for him to get it.  It took another 3 years to get him into therapy.  I think what eventually made him go was my constant insistence and the fact that we would both be in therapy.  We also just completed some couples therapy to work on our communication.  I think that maybe if you started with couples therapy she could ease into the idea of individual therapy.  \n\nMost people hear couples therapy and assume that something is \"wrong\" and their marriage is ending.  This is not always the case.  My husband and I had a really rough first year of parenthood and needed someone to help us sort through things and give us tools about how to communicate in the new dynamic of our family.  It was super helpful and we only used about 5-6 sessions.  This doesn't have to be a long term thing.  I think that if she was able to get any preconceived notions about therapy out of her head with a gentle introduction with you there, it would be easier for her to make that step.  The most important thing about therapy is finding a therapist that you are comfortable with and trust.  I think that's the hardest part, but once you find someone it is so rewarding.  ",

She definitely needs to talk to a professional about that because taking pictures is a part of everyone's lives in the modern world.

            "> Our families are asking for wedding pictures and I don't know what to tell them.\n\nyou tell them the 100% truth",
            "On the one hand, I think it's *so* stupid to be like that about having your photo taken. It's one thing to dislike being in photos. But it's another thing entirely to completely disregard someone else's feelings in such an important situation. \n\nI will preface this by saying that I'm not married, though I have been in a relationship for 4 years. So take what I proclaim to know about marriage with a grain of salt. Anyway. A big part of marriage is (or should be) about communication, having an open dialogue between spouses. Because you (ideally) should trust your spouse more than anyone, should feel comfortable sharing your concerns, etc. Thus, she has greatly disrespected you *not* by refusing to be in the pictures, but by refusing to consult you beforehand. Your wedding day is one of the biggest, most important days of your life. Naturally, most people want a visual memento of that day, so that when they're old and wrinkly and forgetful, they can see that photograph and remember how it felt. She's robbed you of the opportunity to do this. That's disrespectful. \n\nWorst case scenario, she could have demanded that the only photos she would appear in are the ones that are private for your eyes only ('your' meaning you two as a couple). Or, if she's so opposed to seeing photos of herself, you could have the photos for your private collection.\n\nPerhaps this is some sort of psychological issue for her? Is she like this about mirrors? Does she refuse to allow any mirrors in your home? Does she look at her reflection to do ordinary things like put on makeup or brush her teeth?\n\nI'd try getting to the bottom of the (in my opinion) absurd refusal to appear in photos and see where that leads you. But above all, your wife did something behind your back, and that was dishonest and disrespectful. Not a great way to start off a new marriage.",

The fact she was a bride and not even in her own photos is kind of a HUGE thing to not give you a heads up about.\n\nAlso, if her friend is *actually* a wedding photographer, they would probably know better and have gotten photos anyway, but withheld them in the meantime. She's bound to regret not having photos from her youth on her wedding day someday down the line, and this would be a great surprise. If not, the photographer is a gigantic dork.. It's so easy.",

I have a friend who looks amazingly beautiful and yet told me once that she doesn't like to be in pictures. To people like you and me, that sounds weird and unstable - who on earth cares about appearing in a picture as long as they aren't purposely being made to look terrible? They help us save memories. But for some people, they would rather not remember how they look. This is a much bigger problem than it might seem at first. So again, she needs therapy. This is a small thing that could very well be indicative of a larger body of serious issues.",

My relationship with my Dad is never going to be the same; in fact, there may not even be a relationship. My younger step-brother (7) has been largely poisoned against me by his Mom. My sister (19) mostly stays away from my Dad's home because it is so uncomfortable. My other sister (14) feels the need to create even more drama, just so she can get a scrap of attention. It has gotten so unbearable that I don't even feel sane anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I wrote my last post, I really thought there was a solution to my stepmom's behavior. I had many calm discussions with my Dad where we talked about how damaging stepmom's behavior is. Over time those discussions have gotten more heated and mean. We had gone over it over and over and over to the point that I feel like a broken record. Every time we talked about the issue, he would acknowledge that her behavior is terrible (not in those words because he can't say anything bad about her) and tell me that he didn't know why \"she is like this\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd ask him why she never liked me over and over again. \"Why did she never try to get to know me? Why is she so cold? What the hell did I do to deserve this?\" are the questions I asked him pretty much every time I saw him. He never had an answer. All he could say in her defense was the he could see \"both sides\" (even though the issue started when I was a fucking kid and did absolutely nothing) and that she was so stressed because she had to clean up and sometimes no one would eat her dinner. Which is an absolute joke because when I raised my younger sisters by myself starting at age 13, they did the exact same thing to me. My 13 year old self NEVER treated them anywhere close to the way stepmom treats me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI even tried confronting the source of the problem a few times, but it never helped. It probably made things worse. She would just deny any responsibility for her actions and act like I was absolutely insane. It always devolved into shouting because I would get unimaginably frustrated that no one cared or recognized the borderline abuse. And the terrible part is there was nothing that I could really confront her about. There isn't one big thing that she's done; just 7 years of acting like I am not my father's daughter and like she was the victim of a hate crime. It is so hard to put that into words when someone asks you what exactly stepmom has done that is so irredeemable. I would much prefer that she had done something big; knowing someone hates you but will never show it in any other way than coldness is so much worse to me than anger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt got much worse when I had to move back home about 6 months ago because of my financial situation. Also note that I am not freeloading. I have a full time job, I pay my own car bill, I rarely eat their food due to stress-induced appetite loss, I buy all my own clothes, pay for everything related to my dog, and until it got bad I paid rent in the form of using my lunch break to drive my sister home from school (10ish miles from home). And I swear, when I moved in I tried so hard to make things better. I tried so fucking hard to be her friend. But she has just hid away in her room for the majority of the past 6 months, avoiding me. There were some times when it was ok, we'd have friendly conversation, but it never lasted more than a few weeks. I'd either do something unknown to upset her, or she would do something that upset me. 7 years of tension would just bubble over any time anything happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3 months ago, I stopped trying with her. I realized no matter what, she will always hate me. There is no relationship to be had with my stepmom. Ever. And it made me so angry that my Dad didn't care how much I was hurting. He didn't care that the situation made me feel like I was back in that house with my abusive Mom, 13 years old and utterly powerless. So not only did I stop trying, I started being kind of mean. Every time she said something passive aggressive, I'd rudely call her out. Not like it mattered anyway since she rarely talked to me, but I stopped talking to her. I made sure to leave as much as my stuff in the way as much as possible. I stopped doing anything to help stepmom and Dad during my work hours (8-5 M-F, I work from home and used to use my lunch break to drive my sister home from school). I rarely ate her dinners. Stuff like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not necessarily proud of my behavior, but I'm not ashamed either. I hate being mean and it actually doesn't make me feel any better, but I also refuse to just keep ignoring how she treats me. I just wanted something to be different, you know? I didn't care if it made things worse because then maybe someone would finally help me. No one did. My Dad and I began to grow apart and now I have a hard time seeing how he can love me and still let this go on for years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd last night, he let it slip my stepmom is trying to manipulate him into kicking me out. She evidently told him she would move out--OF HER OWN FUCKING HOUSE--just to get away from me. It's the most manipulative thing she has ever done. And it absolutely broke my fucking heart to hear that 1. someone hates me that much and 2. that my own father didn't think that was unacceptable thing to say. Yes, for the past 3 months I have not been nice, but I have not been evil. I have certainly not done anything she herself hasn't done for years. There is nothing wrong with me and I have to keep reminding myself of that. I have certainly done nothing to deserve her making my Dad choose between his daughter and his wife. The conversation ended with me reminding him that under state law, he can't kick me out unless he wants to go through eviction proceedings. I never want it to come to that, I only mentioned it because I have a dog that I am responsible for and I will not let her live on the streets. And that's where we left it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe past few weeks have made me realize that he will never stand up for me. He will never admit that there is nothing that made his wife hate me other than her own crazy. He will never admit that she 100% started this situation out of jealousy or something else when I was a kid. He will never admit it's not my fault (except the escalation that happened when I moved in, something I freely admit I 100% had a big part it). He will never leave her, even though in desperation I have asked him how he could love someone that hated his daughter so much. He won't even admit that my mother abused me for 10+ years, even though the state literally took his children away from her and the investigative report done by CPS was the most scathing, one-sided report that judge had ever seen. He will never love me enough to protect me, and it's devastating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading this very long update. I am about 90% sure I have a place lined up to move within the next week. I will be leaving this house and never coming back unless their marriage ends. I still love my Dad but I am so disappointed in him. I'm not cutting contact out of anger, I'm cutting contact because it is too painful to have my Dad prove to me every single day that he doesn't care how bad anyone treats me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: stepmom has ruined my family and I don't think it is fixable.",

If you could just figure out that one little thing that started this, that one thing that explains it all, that makes a woman in her 30s and 40s act like this, that makes a man not give a crap about his kids, that explains why your life went the way it all did, then you could rectify that and things would get better, right?\n\nWell, no (as I'm sure you can surmise).  Something I've found is that forgiveness isn't about letting the person off the hook.  Hell, I can \"forgive\" people, for lack of a better word, and still would look them in the eye and tell them I'm going to shit on their grave.  But it comes from accepting that as a child, people who were given charge of me didn't have anything remotely close to my best interests in mind.  I was a bartering chip, a useful tool at times, and a nuisance when I wasn't presented as something useful at that moment.  In short, some people who shouldn't have had me around did, and things happened that shouldn't.  The explanation is simple, they're broken people.  No logic will fix this.\n\nSomething that started me on this is a mental exercise.  Go to a playground.  Find a girl around 8 years old.  Imagine you split her family (big step, but bear with me).  She says something hurtful.  Now I want you to hate her with all your might.  \n\nIt's hard.  Stable people will have trouble with it, at best.  They usually should find it impossible.  But there it is.  You have a crazy woman and a gutless man that cares more about not being alone than his own kids' mental health.  It's not a reflection on you.  It's not anything that excuses them.  It's just an explanation that gets you out of those mental loops and helps you move on to bigger and better, hopefully with your sisters.",

I've been in therapy for several years now about it and my therapist told me that I just needed to mourn my father, because he is no longer my father the way a father should be. That's what I've been doing and I don't even talk to my dad anymore and it's all because of my stepmother who treated me horribly as a child. \n\nI'm so sorry you are going through this, but I think you're right...it's not fixable in the way you want it to be. Same for me. At this point I just keep up the status quo so I can still see my siblings that live at home. It's sad but that's how it goes sometimes.",

I hope that you're able to move out asap and re-build yourself a new family of people who will love and support you no matter what. However, I'd be very cautious about ever letting your dad back into your life fully though, even if him and step-mom do split up in the future.

            "I completely understand. This sounds extremely similar as to how I was treated by my dad and step-mother. She would let her own daughter (we are both the same age) go and do whatever she wanted and didn\u2019t have to know where she went, but she had to know my location at all times. There was never a time where I could spend the night at anyone\u2019s houses or anything. I had to do all of the chores, because my sister had a full time job (though at the time I was working around 35 hours a week), and she did not want to do anything ever. My sister got special treatment for everything, and I never got any. My step-mother would treat me like crap and then complain that I never spent any time with them at all. My dad would let her do all of this and never say a word in my defense. My moving out was a huge freaking deal, but my sister got help moving out instead of getting trash bags thrown in her face.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, my dad ended up leaving. He seems so much happier now. We talk about her sometimes, and he seems to hate how he would never do anything to even say a word against what she would do to me. I hate venting to him about her past treatment, but sometimes I have a lot of emotions still about it. My dad is a lot better now, and I am so glad that she is no longer in our lives.\n\n... Though she is trying to get back with my dad, which he is firmly refusing. She is using her getting a better job and making more money as a reason why he should. So unhealthy!",

He chose to mingle on the sidelines, and let your step mother run the show. I\u2019m sorry, but I agree with other Redditors here who say your dad being a pushover is what really what destroyed these relationships. Sometimes lack of action does more harm than action and in this case, it shows. \n\nAs for your stepmother, it\u2019s painfully obvious what\u2019s happening here. She\u2019s insecure. Insecure about the foundation of her family and she\u2019s choosing you as the root of the issue. It isn\u2019t right nor healthy but you, sadly, did everything you could to try and make it work, but the truth is, coupled with your fathers enabling, she wasn\u2019t planning on having a relationship with you. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s also coupled with the guilt of her being a mistress, but that\u2019s up for debate since I don\u2019t know her personally.\n\nI\u2019ll admit, you being mean/inconsiderate basically was like giving her the ultimate excuse to finally express she wanted you gone. I get it, emotions get high and you get fed up. I\u2019m just trying to let you know where her head is at. You were looking for a mom, since yours (from what I\u2019m reading) hasn\u2019t seemed to be at her best, you put a lot of faith into this relationship. Your hurt, disappointed, and that\u2019s ok.\n\nNow you need to ask yourself \u201cWhere do I go from here?\u201d You need to get yourself out of the situation as fast as you possibly can. You need to begin to surround yourself with people who love you and this doesn\u2019t have to particularly family. You did all you could. Now walk away with your head high. \n\nGood luck.",

It sucks when parents aren\u2019t what you think they should be but I will say I have 0 regrets with cutting off all contact.

            "I started feeling my heart jump into my throat the whole time I read this because I legit could have written it myself about my mom and her boyfriend. He has always hated me, but his emotional abuse is covert - silent treatment for over a year, manipulating my mom by avoiding her when I was living with them, holding onto little things he could say I did wrong (like owning candles) when my mom tried to have a conversation with him. \n\nMy mom did the same dance of \u201cnot knowing why he was like this\u201d and did try to claim she saw my pain, but the next day it would be like we never had that conversation. She knew the emotional abuse was happening but didn\u2019t want to leave him, and it devastated me. She also would start to say I was just a cold person who couldn\u2019t accept people\u2019s flaws if I couldn\u2019t accept him. My insecurity since childhood is that I will never be lovable, and she preyed on that by saying I\u2019d never find love if I was so critical. It destroyed me and I know it was her attacking so she didn\u2019t have to deal with the reality that she\u2019d chosen an abusive partner.\n\nI finally left at my therapist\u2019s suggestion a few months ago and let me tell you - it was the best decision I ever made. I sacrificed some of my dreams to financially be able to do it, but it was worth it. That toxicity will destroy you if you stay. My therapist called it \u201cliving in a bath of hatred\u201d - it was eating away at my soul and my self worth every single second I was there. I\u2019m still recovering but I didn\u2019t realize how bad it was until I was out. \n\nI know the grieving that happens when you realize your parent is not capable of emotionally meeting you where you need them to be.

But it reached a point where I could have a \u201cclose\u201d relationship with her and be killing my soul, or have a very distant one and come back to myself. It helped me to find my chosen family, too, and to lean on them.\n\nI feel a little all over the place writing this but just wanted to say you are not alone, and I\u2019m so sorry your dad is not the parent you deserve.

My step mother is a vile woman who never had children of her own and has made it clear she never wanted any, including step, yet expects to be treated and respected in the same way my real mother is.

This is about your stepmom and stepdad. Their relationship is terrible, and he is failing / has failed you as a father. If your dad was more vocal about the efforts you've made to be nice, about your desire to be on good terms with your stepmom, do you really think she'd still be this way? Based on your posts, my guess is that your dad is a spineless echo chamber for your stepmom insecurities, and of course your stepmom has insecurities about sleeping with, and then marrying, your dad. You can't rely on your dad for anything - not to be in your corner, not to stick up for you, not to soothe your stepmoms anger. That sucks, and its awful, but the sooner you can come to terms that your dad is of no help in this situation, the sooner you can rely on yourself to come through. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead of asking yourself, your dad, or your stepmom questions that provoke a defensive answer (e.g. \"Why do you hate me?\" \"Why are you acting this way?\"), ask questions that show your vulnerability and promote inclusiveness, and are solution focused instead of problem focused. (e.g., \"I'm really scared of losing my dad, and I know you love him too. How can we work through this?\" \"I've been horrible to you these past few months, I'm really sorry; what can I do to help right now?\") \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're going to have to be the bigger person here if you want to salvage a relationship with your dad and stepmom. It sucks, and I don't blame you if you don't want to do that, but it's the only way. These are 2 adults who are so lacking in self-reflection and empathy that they don't see the error of their ways, so it falls on you to extend the olive branch. And if you'd rather extend a middle finger, that's ok too. Fuck those guys.",
            "Wow this sounds so familiar to me I could have written it with a few differences. I am 30, my parents split up 11 years ago and my dad started seeing his wife about 9 years ago. My dad took the divorce really hard and was in a bad place so when he met someone new I was all for it! Granted I was young (21) and probably focused more on myself than seeing the reality of things or she was good at pretending to be what she was not. I had to move in with my dad while I finished up college and tried to get on my feet. He was marrying her and moving her and her kids in and asked me to move out. At the time, I glossed over this and tried to believe it was because it was time for me to go. Now years later I see she must have forced this on him and things have gone downhill ever since. In fact, two months ago I started therapy because of her bizarre jealous behavior towards me and my dads refusal to put a stop to it. I have never done a thing to this woman and she has always acted like I am my father\u2019s ex girlfriend or something? It really really disturbs me. As I have grown older, lost weight, blossomed and become a more confident woman I have noticed the jealously has gotten much worse. To wrap things up: I got married 6 months ago and she wore a white beaded embellished dress to my wedding. I\u2019d say that says it all. \nSo anyway I have no advice other than solidarity and just remember you cannot fix crazy, you can only control your reaction to crazy. Remember their behavior is a reflection of their own inadequacies and have nothing to do with you. Easier said than done of course.\n\nEdited to add: I am also a stepmom myself and I still wholeheartedly understand you and believe you! Being a stepparent is really hard and nobody should take that job on if they aren\u2019t going to at least attempt to be a decent person",

You've both been terrorizing her and then calling her manipulate when she can't deal with you. She didn't ask your dad to kick you out, she offered to go so that he wouldn't have to choose between her and his daughters. \n\nConsider that you have contributed to the problem that you did not start, AND played right into her hand by intentionally causing chaos in the home as an act of revenge.

            "I can 100% relate. My step mom was evil, and she hated me, which unfortunately I didn't see until way later when I was trying to have some sort of connection to an adult woman...\nAnd then I realized that she had NEVER loved me. It hurt but.... I think somewhere I knew. She was nice to me when I was little but when she had my sister she started getting jealous of my connection with my dad and trying to push every bad thing off on me to make me look like a bad kid, which I wasn't perfect but I really wasn't that bad. \n\n\nTurns out after I finally left, she couldn't turn that behavior off and she ended up alienating all of her own children as well. \n\n\nMy father also did nothing. After I left he would call me to complain about his wife and how crazy she was being. And at first that was like retribution for all of the crazy things she had ever said about me, but I realized that he was just using me as a syphon for all of his hurt and confused feelings and that he wasn't going to do anything to change his predicament unless I stopped feeding into that. So I did. \nI told him that i didn't want to hear about her. \n\n\nSurprisingly, he did stop talking about her. I could tell it was hard, and he had a few slipups but he always apologized... then about two years ago he called me to tell me that he was divorcing her. I might have laughed at him because it took him so long.... but he was finally able to move forward with his life. \n\n\nAnd it took a while, but I was finally able to forgive him for being such a thick skulled idiot.... your dad is only human, and he really did mess up, so did mine.... I had to accept the fact that even though he saw the problems he wasn't brave enough to take the steps to find the solution..... and that's what I forgave him for.... \n\n\nYou are about 21. I would suggest moving out, if you can. Move in with friends, find a roomate... anything to get you away from that sort of toxic situation because when you leave home you can really start to shape your future and make requests, like not hearing about your stepmom or going to see your father when she isn't around.... things just become a whole lot cleared when you move away.",

            "Oh my word, my heart is breaking reading this. I know what it's like for a parent to choose their new spouse over their children. I also know what it's like to have a parent not stand up and take your corner. Both situations are extremely hurtful. I realised as a teenager that NOTHING I did would be good enough to please my Dad. Quite often I was in the wrong without even knowing it. So, I made a decision; if I could NEVER make him happy, at least I could try and make myself happy.  I did it and it worked for me - I didn't see any point in us both being miserable. I think this is the attitude you should try and take around your stepmom. She has made it clear she doesn't like you, so stop doing anything in the hope of pleasing her. Tell your Dad you want to keep seeing him, but stop pandering to her drama. If she wants to be out of the house when you're there that's up to her. I bet if anyone called her bluff about leaving she'd soon back down. Unfortunately, your Dad won't call her out but I don't think he'd really stand up to her either. \nWhy don't you try to have a get together with your sibs and Dad somewhere else? If she kicks off about that just say you didn't want to make her uncomfortable.

            "I'm scratching my head wondering why you,  an adult,  is so worried about what your stepmother thinks of you.   Yeah she probably doesn't like you.  It sucks but you will meet plenty of people in your life that just won't like you. \nDealing with people who don't like you,  and vice versa is a skill every adult needs to learn. \nSpending 3 months being petty doesn't help your step mother,  it doesn't help your father,  and it doesn't help you.  In fact in this case it seems that this approach worked against your own interests. \nMy advice to you is to fake an apology.  You don't have to mean it,  she just has to think you do.  Then just try to stay out of each others way.   Every time she gives you a dirty look,  return the favor with a genuine smile.   Pretty soon you will never have to see her again,  but she doesn't need to know that is why you are smiling. \n\nTldr: swallow your pride. Do not let your ego get in the way of your own goals.",

            "Wow, same exact thing happened to me when my dad married his second wife. Him and I went through hell with my NPD mom and were much closer to best friends than dad and daughter. My dad finally realized \"staying together for their daughters sake\" was doing more harm to me when I turned 16 and had her move out. My dad and I remained best friends up until my early/mid twenties. Then my mom passed away and he started dating Susan. She was wonderful to me in the beginning and I was ecstatic when they got engaged. They told me that they were going to get married in Mexico and just wanted a private ceremony between the two of them. I found out a week before the wedding through their mutual friend that it wasn't just a wedding between the two of them when she asked \"Are you excited for the wedding in Mexico? My husband and I just booked tickets!\" The look on my face told her everything. Awkward.\n\nConfronted both of them, Susan stepped in not giving my dad a chance to reply \"We both know you can't afford to go to Mexico on your salary\". My dad makes 6 figures a year and she had just received a half million dollar inheritance. I said \"It would have been nice to at least be invited, I am his only child and he's my best friend. If you loan me the money I'll pay you back\" she claimed that it wasn't about the money, but she wasn't willing to let my father loan me the money which \"Might take you years to pay back\".\n\nThat's when I realized I had lost my dad forever. We've spoken twice since then. I needed my birth certificate and other important documents from him - he sent them from his work address. They just bought a nice two story home in a upscale part of Los Angeles and he didn't want me to know his new address.\n\nI wish them the best, my dad deserves to be happy and if she really makes him happy he deserves it. He went through hell with my mom. However Susan is in her mid 60s, well late 60s now. My dad is in his mid 50s. She's not in the greatest of health so I hope they get all the quality alone time they want while she's still alive. Unfortunately I don't think I'll forgive my father for allowing someone to destroy our 25 year friendship. So when she's gone and he's alone again, he'll have to live with the decisions he's made as I won't be around to keep him company.\n\nIt breaks my heart that you've gone through this OP. It breaks my heart from the replies that this has happened to other people. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.  Big internet hugs to OP, and anyone else that's been through this traumatizing experience.",

            "I'm so sorry you're going through this. I haven't ever dealt with abuse like that, but I do know what it's like to have a father that doesn't seem to care very much.\n\n\nI didn't meet him until I was 15 because I was raised by my maternal grandparents. He has tried over the years....sorta. He mostly tried to buy my love back then, but as I got older, he just didn't put in any effort. He lived in another state and there were so many times he came down to visit the rest of the family and never told me he was coming. I had my feelings hurt a LOT over the years.\n\n\nI'm 31 now. A couple of years ago, we had a bit of a falling out and I realized he just...doesn't give a fuck. I was always the one reaching out to him. I finally stopped. You know how often he has reached out since then? Maybe 4 or 5 and that's usually on my birthday.\n\n\nI felt SO much better after I came to realize that I owe him nothing. I don't owe his family anything. If they don't care about me, why waste my time trying to visit or talk to them? So I just stopped. It felt like a weight had been lifted.\n\n\nThis story is basically just to let you know that it's okay to cut them off. If they can't put in any effort to maintain a relationship with you, you don't need to be the one trying to hold it all together. You don't need to feel guilty. You need to take care of yourself instead of allowing them to continue to hurt you. You will be okay. It might hurt right now, but over time, you will begin to heal as you allow these old wounds to finally close up.",

All this will be better for your own sanity.\n\nI had a similar situation with my dad remarrying someone who I have pretty much zero relationship with, although I was fortunate in that my childhood was very stable and I was super close with both parents, and everything in my family fell apart more so in my early 20s. So I think my perspective on things are slightly different than what it would have been if it happened when I was younger. \n\nBut yeah the new wife didn\u2019t make a good impression on me when she basically insulted my home and dissed me on social media - which my mom and all my relatives saw! She never truly apologized, and my dad didn\u2019t take a strong stance about it. It ruined the holidays for me. I had to be up front with him and told him how it made me feel like crap and that I probably won\u2019t want to see her or have her over if they visited. I didn\u2019t see her for months, although I still saw my dad separately. He made time to help me with groceries and things. It was an awkward situation. I finally had dinner with both of them on his birthday, I guess as a sort of \u201ctruce.\u201d She still never truly apologized and we never talk. I\u2019ve just come to terms with that. I want to keep my relationship with my dad, though. And he tries - still helps me with things and calls me now and then.\n\nHonestly now that I\u2019m older, living my own life, in my own home, away from the drama, I know I can\u2019t be forever bitter about these things. I only have my parents for who knows how long, and I\u2019m an only child. If something ever happens, god forbid we\u2019re gonna have to come together somehow. It\u2019s a morbid way of looking at it, but it gives me peace in a weird way. I can\u2019t weigh my heart down forever. You, too, will find peace in your own way. It might take a while, some growing pains. But you will know.",

My dad chose his wife over his kids and put us in danger and at risk to protect his marriage. My stepmom was abusive and exploitive towards both my sister and I.  My dad never stood up for me either. He let it happen for years. Took zero accountability or blame. I moved out when I was 15. I\u2019m 29 now. I have not been welcomed into my dads home since I moved out almost 15 years ago. He lies to his wife about talking with me. I\u2019ve tried to make amends with her (even though she\u2019s the bad guy) several times over the years. Eventually I had to set some really big boundaries with him to protect myself and my heart. \n\nI took me a long time to understand that it was his choice to pick her and let that continue. It took me years of therapy to understand that it\u2019s not my fault. And it\u2019s not your fault either, Miss Molly. Your dad sucks and is an incredibly selfish person. It doesn\u2019t make it hurt any less, it doesn\u2019t make the void any smaller, and it doesn\u2019t mean you still don\u2019t love him. But you are worthy of love, acceptance, family and belonging.

Since that day I tried to avoid spending time at home and mostly hung out with other teenagers who didn\u2019t want to be at home either. Needless to say we spend a lot of time drinking and fooling around in the city. It was a fun time and took my mind of the abuse at home. The girlfriend used this in turn to tell my dad I was out of control and stealing money (which I did not do!). I overheard her bad mouthing me a lot. And eventually he kicked me out when I was just 17. This really broke my heart. Not only did my dad not stand up for me but he believed I was a thief and a drug addict. I told him she was making those things up. He would tell me to do something about it but he never did. \nLuckily a social worker convinced me to move back in with my mom. \nI am now 25 so it has been some years since then and I still can\u2019t get over it really.

            "I am sorry to read your story. You have tried so hard to reach out to your father and step-mother but neither of them have been emotionally accessible.  By condoning your stepmother's manipulative and emotionally abusive behavior, and not standing up to her, your dad has been complicit all this time.\n\nI hope you find a stable place to live, because I think it's actually good for you to move out of that hostile environment. Your dad hasn't been there for you which is exactly why it has come to you moving out - he had a say in the matter after all. Perhaps you could give yourself some space and focus on your relationship with your sisters?",
            "\u201cDad, I\u2019m so hurt, so heartbroken that you let me go through this with her, with mom, and you\u2019re letting it happen to my sisters. I really held on to the belief that you loved me for so long, but when fathers love their daughters, they stand up for them and confront issues with their wives. I don\u2019t feel loved by you. You abandoned me emotionally. I\u2019m disappointed in you. And you\u2019re a coward. You failed as a dad, I hope it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nThen walk out of that miserable house and never return.",
            "Moving into their house has probably been the cause of most of your heartache here. You made a huge error when you moved in with them. If you live with someone rent free or not then you need to be the most gracious, forgiving, generous person possible because they are giving you something without value - intrusion into their space and privacy. It massively raises the level of tension and causes blow ups like this to be practically inevitable when there's already bad feelings. Also, it's impossible to maintain proper boundaries and cooling off periods when you live in the same house as someone so issues escalate rather than fade away with time.\n\nGet out right away, cool off over the course of the next year or so and then try to slowly rebuild with your dad by making occasional contact. Don't bother about your stepmom.",
            "I am so so sorry for you and by reading what you tried: you tried a lot and enough. \n\nSeeing you as a rival in a perceived fight fo the love of your father is absolutely pervert. Never forget that, ok? Your stepmum might be a narcissist.\n\nBut what is even worse and crushing is your fathers behaviour. It is weak, spineless and abusive in his neclect to act in any way. I\u2019m not sure about your stepmum but I have no doubt about your dad. He is an enabler. And he doesn\u2019t act fatherly. There\u2019s nothing wholeheartedly to gain from him, you can get only what is acceptable within the boundaries your stepmum set. Like it was with your biomother.\n\nI\u2018d suggest therapy. You did not lose a strong father figure, you never had one and realising this hurts a lot. Reading this makes me second hand angry, I can only fathom how angry you are. He is just a male weakling who dithers through his relationships and this might affect your own future relationships. \n\nAgain, so sory for you. :(",
            "Hey, i really think you should (when financially able to) see a professional to help you work through your apparent realisation that your father is just as abusive as the women he has inserted into your life - through negligence and complicity.\n\nA fee years back I saw a psych and after two sessions they said how concerned they were about my childhood neglect. In an instant I was on my feet and railing against the suggestion about how my mother always put us first, worked so hard, sacrificed for us, how *dare* you slander her, how dare you be so *unprofessional*.\n\nThen i went to work and spent the day trying to look busy whilst my mind was dealing with the most extreme cognitive dissonance I have ever experienced. Over the next few weeks, I began to peek at the seed of doubt. Over the next few months I began to accept it. And over the next few years, I became fully aware of it - Dr Laura Firestone wrote an article about Anxious Attachment Types which really opened my eyes to my childhood experiences. Google it. Turns out I ended up with an avoidant attachment style, but given the stems she outlaid in that piece, I really should have become an anxious type - when you take my bio dad and their relationship, and then my stepfather and their relationship into account, it's easy to understand why I became avoidant. Men are a higher priority, apparently.\n\nI digress. I'm sharing my story in the hopes you will see *there is absolutely nothing wrong with you* and perhaps through reading Dr Firestone's articles you may begin to gain some inner peace and perspective and let yourself evict *them* from inside your head.\n\nChildren believe their parents are infallible - we must, for our own mental and emotional 'stability' at an early age. Children view their parents as their sole providers & protectors - to question that as a child is to create cognitive dissonance and threaten your own support structures. However, some of us carry this idealisation into adulthood, at a time when we should be beginning to recognise our parents as flawed creatures just like ourselves - and, for those people fortunate enough to have been raised by people who prioritised them, that's an easy transition. For those of us who were not prioritised but WERE having 'respect my authority' shoved down our throats, it creates dissonance because we are disobeying instructions that were embedded in our mental code from day dot. That's not an easy thing to do when you had another openly abusive parent, and the one in question seemed like they were the Protector and Provider that you desperately needed. I'm glad to see you've started being assertive about your needs, wants, and tolerances, but you will benefit greatly from hashing this out with someone trained to be objective and provide you with tools to deal with the problems.",
            "Well, honestly what did you expect her reaction would be? She only tolerated you when you behaved, now that you started not talking to her in her own house she wants you out. Predictable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think your only mistake is wanting so badly to be liked and accepted by this woman. Perhaps your personalities simply crash and aren't compatible, it happens even when civil people are involved in relationship dynamics. I am also uncertain how you expected a woman who demonstrated little moral fiber to become the perfect mom who had unconditional love for you. It can definitely happen but only in rare situations where people truly regret their past mistakes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou should have Just lived and let live as long as you need them to help you out. If she doesn't feel like interacting with you and simply avoids you but isn't actively hurting you, what's the big deal? You seem to think she's somehow obligated to love you and your actions simply scream \"why won't you love me??\".\n\nIt's just life, kid. Here's hoping your life will slowly but surely fill out with people who love you. Stay kind and loving.",
            "I can\u2019t imagine what this would do to me, if I were in your shoes. I have low self-esteem, even with wonderful people in my life. \n\nIt\u2019s possible that she is a psychopath and narcissist. Or some other such thing. (Which isn\u2019t something she even gets to decide, HERSELF.)\n\nInstead of trying to make sense of her, and make things work, it\u2019s better (for you) to see her as a destructive force of nature. Stop trying to reason with a tornado. \n\nThe same thing with your father, except he\u2019s more analogous to a prey animal.  You want to cuddle it, but it\u2019s scared of you, so it runs away. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. I can tell you are an immensely strong person (although you may feel the opposite at times). You will get through this.",
            "I'm sorry to hear this frustrating update, and I'm sorry you're having to deal with this.\n\nYour dad is not special because he's your dad. He was never trained or qualified to become a parent, and he never tried to learn to be better, either. He is just some regular schmo off the street who banged a female-bodied person and got her pregnant. Oddly enough, people who are the least responsible end up with the most responsibilities in the form of offspring.\n\nYou know he has always let you down. You know- after 20 years of the same behavior- he will probably never change. You have no obligation to maintain contact with him. Your life would be infinitely better if you focus your energy on bettering yourself and your circumstances. Maybe someday you will be in a place to help your siblings, too.",
            "Your Dad, man.\n\nI'm sorry OP. I'm so sorry.",
            "That really sucks, and you have my sympathy. I've recently ended up realizing that my father prefers my step-family over me. It sucks, and I'm nearly twice your age. I think I would have been a lot more hurt if I were closer to your age.",
            "Sometimes one of our biggest lessons in life is learning that other people can let us down. They will not or cannot be who we need them to be. It is up to us to pull ourselves up and make it out. We have to find ways to get our emotional needs met and take action that brings positive growth in our lives. It sounds like you're strong and are going to do fine. You have the power to choose who you let in your life in the future. Choose people who hold similar qualities and values as yourself. You'll find peace and happiness. Then close the door on these people and never question what \"you\" did again. This is them and their weaknesses at play. Perhaps you will have planted a seed of growth in them, but either way, your future can be bright.",
            "I just want to tell you that I really, really appreciate this and you. It gave me the strength to be able to tell my Dad I love him but that I can\u2019t understand him anymore. My heart goes out to you and this helped me more than you\u2019ll ever know.",
            "I\u2019m so so sorry this is happening to you. I have been in a very similar situation, our fathers even seem similar, as do our step monsters. I\u2019ll spare you the gory details, but I just wanted you to know I\u2019m impressed with how well you are handling this, all things considered. This is not your fault, and nothing you could do could have changed this. You didn\u2019t choose to be abused, you didn\u2019t cause your own abuse, there are no magic words or actions that could have changed this.  Your father is a weak man. As you get older, be prepared to feel more anger at him as you grow in maturity and realize how shitty and enabling of abuse his behavior has been and is.\n\nThe letter you wrote at age 8 is completely irrelevant to how your step-mother treated you. You clearly spent a long time thinking about what you did to cause this situation and how you can fix it. You didn\u2019t do anything\u2014no letter written by an 8 year old, no treatment by a little kid, could have any effect on the words and deeds of an adult woman. I know I spent far too much time obsessing over what I must have done to make my step-mother be so hateful to me, and I tried to do whatever I could to make amends. Eventually I realized what I did was to exist. And she didn\u2019t spent one second of time thinking about improving our relationship, since she didn\u2019t want a relationship. She just thought about ways to get rid of me. \n\nGo forth and build a great life. Help out your younger siblings when you\u2019re able to. Don\u2019t look for love from people who are hateful and abusive. That includes your father, who isn\u2019t hateful, but he is abusive and enabling and he will never treat you right.",

            "I don't blame you for suddenly snapping back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis isn't borderline abuse. This is abuse. She is gaslighting you by not holding herself accountable/denying her actions when you call her out and making you seem \"crazy\". It's a blatant abuse/manipulation tactic and it is absolutely disgusting she is doing that to you. And, even more, it is disgusting that your father is enabling this abuse. I would understand if he maybe had to talk to her once or twice about her behavior...but it is very telling to me what kind of person she is that she will put on an act to appease your father and then revert back to the same stuff. I wouldn't be surprised is that in and of itself has been a manipulation tactic to get you to snap and make you look like the bad guy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy advice is to get out of there ASAP, for the sake of your own mental health. You don't deserve this. And, frankly, your father doesn't deserve you if he is ok with her abusing you (and your biological mother abusing you as well, it seems).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake your time to heal. Go through therapy. Build your own family, full of people who deserve to have you in their life. I am so sorry you're going through this.",
            "I am so so sorry Miss Molly.  I just want to give you a big fucking hug.  Your dad and your step-mom fucking suck.  But you know what?  You are fucking awesome.  You are like a rock.  Look at you - so insightful, strong-willed, and have your shit together.  That will serve you well in life.\n\nI am so sorry your family sucks.  Mine sucks too.  It happens, but it really really fucking sucks.  But I'm proud of you for dealing with it head-on.  You got balls.\n\nIf you want, you should check out the raised by narcissists sub.  That's your fucking piece-of-shit step-mom.  Honestly, loving your kid is a requirement - anything less than what is abuse.  She should have treated you so much better; she didnt need to have done any one \"big\" thing that you could point to.  That was the enabling, manipulative sides of them, trying to make you intentionally feel crazy.  Like there is nothing wrong.  Fuck them.  Manipulative monsters.\n\nYour dad was an enabling asshat, just like my mom, just to preserve his own meager existence.  \n\nYou should check out raised by narcissists, there are your people.  I'm so fucking sorry you had to grow up like this.  But fuck them.  Go off and have a life that makes you happy despite them.  Absolutely cut them out of your life, asap, except maybe to rub in their face how content you are in life without them.\n\nYou don't need their love.  Fuck them.  You are awesome.  Know that.  Believe that.  Even if they never fucking showed it, believe it.\n\nMaybe see a therapist to make it easier to love other ppl besides them.\n\nBut feel free to message me anytime if you would like to - I will ALWAYS be here for you.  I don't got much else to do haha :)\n\nChin up - go do something that makes you content Miss Molly! ;)",

I hope you can do it sooner rather than later, and start the next part of your life, the happy part. \n\nGet whatever therapy you can too.  It should help.",

In future, when people ask about your father, just say 'he wasn't able to step up to the title that DAD usually means, I love him but I don't respect him' The woman in his life obviously feels threatened and that's her issue, not yours, don't judge yourself on her opinion. \nYour a bright (your post is so well written) and clearly emotionally mature young person, carry on just being you and strive to never be anything like the bad role models you've experienced xXx",

            "I\u2019m so sorry to read this, especially because it is exactly like my own situation (my father married not one but TWO borderline narcissistic personality women in a row - going on his 3rd divorce now).\n\nHonestly, as sad as it is to say, I personally don\u2019t believe it\u2019s healthy for you to force a relationship with your dad. After 20 years of similar abuse and manipulation from both of my stepmothers, both my sister and I chose to move to Europe (to different countries but within a year of each other - we are from the US by the way). The longer I\u2019m here, the better I feel, I think it\u2019s literally the only way I can have a relationship with my father - in very controlled doses, with a 7 hour time difference and 12 hour flight between us. This distance and forced boundary is helping me slowly heal and build up my own boundaries, as my dad (similar to yours it seems) really let the flood gates of my stepmothers\u2019 madness open and just kept excusing both of their behavior as \u201cthey can\u2019t help it, they\u2019re sick, they\u2019re hurting so much...\u201d \n\nSecond key point that hit me like a eureka lightening bolt was when I realized that it takes TWO people to be in that kind of relationship. Your father is choosing to stay with her and sacrifice you to her sickness. He is at fault, and has failed you as a parent to protect you. I can\u2019t force my father to go to therapy and fix himself, but people who choose to enter and stay in situations like these have issues themselves. \n\nI finally hit a wall and decided I didn\u2019t want to live my life being treated like shit by someone who isn\u2019t my blood and who I don\u2019t love. For us, this is a healthy option, and I encourage you to find how you can safely define and build your own boundaries - as adults we don\u2019t have to live with our parents poor and unhealthy choices. We can find alternatives to love them without living in their maladaptive worlds. \n\nI hope you find the best way for you to move forwards with your life, but just know there are a lot of others with similar experiences (I know 10+ American expats in Europe actually who come from homes with borderline parents or step parents...). There is a bright light at the end of the tunnel!",

            "A parents number one responsiblity is caring for their children ABOVE ALL ELSE. He has failed as a father and as a human being. I'm sorry he's so selfish that he put his own feelings above your own, especially when you're so young. You shouldn't ever have had to endure this.",
            "I'm so sorry you're going through this. I actually went through something incredibly similar with my own stepmum so if you want to talk about it/have a rant, my inbox is always open!",
            "It makes me so sad seeing this because I\u2019m currently on my 48th day of cutting off my father for similar reasons. I finally could not take it anymore. My father was not my biological father but chose to become my dad at 1 and remarried his wife my freshmen year. She is delusional and despite both of my parents never making a move to get back together she sees me as a threat cause I\u2019m not \u201chis blood\u201d. My dad was fucking adopted. Despite that he stopped calling and visiting me as much and even fake cut me off once In a text to prove to her manipulative ass that he would do anything for her. She uses depression as a weapon. I\u2019ve always been nice to her but I was sick of being the punching bag of their problems. It hurts to have to lose the man I always called my father but it\u2019s unacceptable for her to even be able to treat me like that in the first place. Your step mom shouldn\u2019t be able to make ultimatums and it hurts when dads don\u2019t stick up. But if it\u2019s hurting you sometimes you have to love people from afar.",
            "Just commenting to say i know how this feels and goes: my current stepmom has hated me for no real discernible reason even back when she and my dad were dating. My dad has ultimately chosen her over any semblance of a relationship with any of his children from previous marriages. I hope his retirement is in order because he's never getting help from me.",
            "Im going to throw out a different idea about all this as my first thought while reading through this was to scroll to the top and make sure I was actually in r/raisedbynarcissists and was surprised I was wrong!\n\nYour stepmom is a narcissist, possibly even Borderline Personality Disorder as thry can go hand in hand but Idk enough to say BPD but definitely, 100% seems like a narcissist. If she was BPD I can see how your dad got roped in and how he is walking a fine line to stepping to either your side or her side and landing on a landmine either way, placed by her. Im not excusing your dad at all but the way they manipulate you is to eventually erode any and all self confidence and make you dependent on them bc they are so insecure they need you to believe they are the only way you can go on living so you(Dad) will never leave them for their batshit crazy antics.\n\nIt is the wildest, highest and lowest rollercoaster that leaves you dependent on the high so that you can ride out the low which takes true skill to be able to manipulate someone so bad so that they will stay with the BPD person.\n\nAt least this is the only possible reason I can see that he wouldnt go out of his way for you. As its easy for you to say what you would do if you are not in that situation. You have a wife and younger kids still living with you and your core family unit with house and friends, and on the other hand you have your daughter who is a young adult starting her life and besides living at home seems to have her shit together and will be fine. He took what he thought was the lesser of two evils no matter how fucked up that is to us reading it and definitely to OP.\n\nI would hope to god if Im ever in this situation Id do the right thing and pick my child but all Im saying is none of us can say for 100% what we would do.\n\nIm so sorry youre dealing with this OP. I guess the only reason I commented here was to say he has a side of this story too and before you say goodbye to your dad for good, Id make sure I got his true, un-manipulated side. But fuck your stepmom, she sounds terrible and doesnt deserve the time of day!",
            "Just act like a responsible houseguest. Pick up after yourself. Don't engage. Save your money and get out. No-one will or is winning in the current situation.  Move on and up.\n\nYour father's wife is just that.  Nothing to you.  Move on! I would bet if you look at the situation objectively, you would see that your father has probably not been a really strong person throughout. He probably just wants an easy life, and you are complicating it. Sad for you but you have your whole life to move on and life a good life. Best wishes to you.",
