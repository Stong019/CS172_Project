        "selftext": "Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/434ot4/i_25m_won_2_tickets_to_the_super_bowl_my/\n\nThanks everyone for the advice. It was very helpful. This was a very stressful and long few days. I'm just glad there seems to be a resolution. I had tried talking to my girlfriend and she was still clearly upset. I approached the conversation as many people said keeping an understanding that she was more disappointed than controlling and would come around. Unfortunately she was being unreasonable. She said \"I could go\" but that doing so would hurt her a great deal and that she would need some time to reevaluate things. I should have just ended things with her there but I was so sick of these tickets by this point that I didn't even have the heart to go even if I did decide to end things with her. As suggested by some of the comments here, I called up the radio station and asked if it was at all possible to transfer the tickets to my brother so he could go with his wife. They were totally understanding and awesome about it and said they were sorry I couldn't go but they were glad to put the tickets in my brothers name for me. I was just glad to have it behind me at that point. \n\nI told my girlfriend what I did and that I was staying here and she said that I was \"being dramatic\" and \"immature.\" She said that I transferred the tickets to my brother just so I could \"win\" the argument and look like a martyr. It was at this point I reached my breaking point. I calmly told her this relationship was over. I wasn't even mad at this point just confused that a person I thought I knew could act this way. She said she was gonna break up with me because of the way I handled this anyway so breaking up with her \"didn't matter.\" \n\nMy brother immediately told me I dodged a bullet and glad that she was out of everyone's lives. My brother's wife was totally cool about me using her ticket and didn't even question it even after I'm technically taking back my gift to her. They insisted that I go with my brother and it was their idea. So now I'm the guest of my original tickets that I won. Happy to say I arrived in SF a few days ago and am having the time of my life. My girlfriend didn't unfollow me on social media and I'm posting as many pictures as I possibly can. Thanks everyone!\n\ntl;dr - Transfered tickets to my brother. Girlfriend was still petulant and we broke up. Got to go on the trip with my brother anyway. ",

I went through more therapy to be absolutely certain that I needed the medication. My therapist used the same multiple choice test on my feelings and symptoms twice (pre-test and post-test) to determine that nothing had changed/gotten better really over the course of 3 months or so. I began taking 10mg a day of an antidepressant and sensed a change fairly quickly. It took 3-4 weeks to fully kick in, but I think I started feeling it around 2 weeks. I am so much happier than before and I do not think about my life ending 3-5 times a week anymore. Now that I write that, I rarely think about it at all now. The things that used to seem like mountains are now just little mole hills. I cannot fully express how I wish I would have considered taking medication earlier. I feel like I wasted years of my life being so disgustingly unhappy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust earlier this week I broke up with Eli because I will be moving away for a job and I was no longer happy with the way the relationship was going.

            "Congratulations on really taking control of your life! I wish I would have started antidepressants much sooner than I did. I feel like I could have spent so much less time unhappy and not moving forward. ",
            "I really needed to see this post. I need to get back on my antidepressants and my husband does not want me to. I\u2019ve been off them the eight months I\u2019ve been pregnant and have watched myself deteriorate. I can no longer take care of myself. That\u2019s how bad it\u2019s gotten. I won\u2019t. I need to get back on meds and he just wants to find \u201canother way.\u201d I\u2019ve decided not to listen to him for the rest of the day. He can talk about vegus nerve stimulation all he wants. I know what works for me and I\u2019m gonna see a doctor. Thank you for your update. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re doing better. ",
            "I really wonder what was going on with your boyfriend and the many depressed women in his life.  I wonder if the relationship with his mom was really codependent when she was depressed, and when she got better she put up healthier boundaries and he felt deserted because he wasn\u2019t used to that.  Maybe that\u2019s why he dated two clinically depressed women and disapproved of them being treated.  Not saying I don\u2019t empathize - it\u2019s hard when a fundamental relationship like that changes, but it sounds like he needs some serious therapy himself.",
            "Awesome update, congratulations!!! \n\nI\u2019m curious what Eli\u2019s reaction was when you actually started taking them. Did he get pissed at first and eventually see how positive it was for you, or did he continue giving you shit for it?",

Life changing.  Seriously, I get what you\u2019re saying that it started almost immediately.  It does.  It happens seriously fast.  I never knew I wasn\u2019t like everyone else until I was diagnosed.  When I first took the pills and started to immediately notice the difference I cried.  Not because I was sad but because I never knew I could ever not feel so bad all the time with my emotions changing daily/hourly.  I stopped being suicidal and always thinking of ways to kill myself.  Every thing changed for the better.  \n\nGood luck with your move.  I think great things are coming your way and you deserve it!  ",

They don't go away, it just feels easier.\n\nSounds like the relationship was possibly dragging you down too. Good luck.",
            "Nine years ago on Mother's Day, I came back to the home I shared with my little brother. We'd had a fight that morning before I went to work and I got off early, so I went to his room to ask him if he wanted some of the food I was about to make, a sort of apology. He wasn't home, his shotgun case was open on his bed, and his suicide note was on his desk. Apparently, he had tried to kill himself with booze and pills, and had told an online friend (who lived two thousand miles away) that he thought he was going to die that day. When he stopped responding to messages, his friend managed to contact emergency services in our state. When they found him, he was jaundiced, unconscious, and unresponsive. He lived. I picked him up from the hospital two weeks later (with a prescription for pills that he never filled) and we cried together and I told him that I was happy he was alive.\n\nOver the next four years, there was one more attempt and a lot of threats of suicide. Felt like we were always walking on eggshells around him. He was part of the generation of kids who were overly diagnosed with ADHD and absolutely loathed having to take pills in general. But! He found a freaking FANTASTIC therapist and paired with (the right!) pills and therapy, I can happily say that he's living his best life. In fact, he's on a backpacking trip now and the only time it occurred to me that there might be a suicide attempt was when I was typing this out and thinking \"oh, man, we would have been almost sure he wouldn't come back from that five years ago.\"\n\nI am glad that you (and my little brother) have taken control of your mental health. It is something that, far too often, is seen as a punchline. But it is so, so, so very important. You've got this, OP. And that means one less person is suffering. And maybe more who, after reading this, think \"maybe, just maybe, the pills will help.\"",

            "I\u2019m so happy for you but be careful....certain antidepressants can make you feel better but then you notice your mood change again instantly (ex. Zoloft) if you feel the need to change meds, do it! Do what\u2019s best for you :)",
            "I\u2019m glad! The things he said about anti depressants was completely bullshit. Like wow. How ignorant do you have to be? I bet the girlfriend he had who took antidepressants before you, took them and improved her life and ALSO decided the relationship wasn\u2019t for the best as well. \n\nThat might sound hard. But sometimes people can be selfish and o my think of themselves. Sometimes people don\u2019t want you to grow. There are people who are so used to \u201csomething\u201d always going on, that when nothing bad is happening, it bores them. \n\nWho knows.

            "My best friend started taking antidepressants, and what a difference.  Sometimes life doesn't play fair with our emotions. I'm glad we have antidepressants, so we can play unfair right back. \n\nThanks for sharing that you took the medication, I think that helps to normalize something which should really be far more common.",
            "I've got to speak up and say that the things you've related about your ex do not indicate that he was able to be a safe or supportive person or even be in a healthy relationship, certainly not with someone who experiences mental health issues- so the majority of people at some point.\n\nIt can be extremely difficult for patients & professionals to determine whether a patient's issues are due to their original problems or whether they are side effects or a result of a misdiagnosis or a medication not working as intended. Certainly loved ones can be valuable witnesses, but they also often have biases, like in your case.\n\nYour situation was pretty straightforward, honestly. And many antidepressants are among the safest and best understood of all psychiatric meds. His reaction(s) were extremely emotional and not only irrational- what he describes sounds much more like the issues they were *prescribed for*- but extraordinarily dangerous. \n\nThinking of hurting yourself is not mild depression, especially on a regular basis; I understand it can feel very normal and controllable, but it is a symptom of severe depression & can lead to either chronically self destructive choices or impulsively dangerous/self destructive choices.\n\nI'm sure you're pretty familiar with all this, since you're seeing a therapist. (I hope so!) But I just want to reassure you that you don't have to put up with treatment like that; you are definitely worth treating straight away. We have the technology and the understanding to care for you! And I want to celebrate with you that life is so much better, too! Hip! Hip! Hurray!",

            "That is so awesome for you, that you found something that helped you! My very good friend who has had bouts of depression his whole life, fell into one about a year and a half ago that we were all very concerned about. I'm not sure how to describe it, but you could just see the curtain coming over his face when it hit him, which it did constantly.\n\nHe was in therapy, and they tried various things, but eventually he got a doctor that looked at the drugs he was taking and realized they weren't giving him *nearly* enough of a dose of Prozac(? I think?) to make any sort of difference. It was like the difference between a 10 mg and a 40 mg dose, IIRC, something quadruple what he had been on.\n\nIt took about two or three weeks, but the final week he lifted out of his funk for first a day, then back, then a couple days later another lift, then back, and finally one morning he woke up and it was lifted and hasn't come back since. It's been about three months now and he's doing great.\n\nSo I've seen first hand the effect the proper medication can have on someone who's struggling, and I'm so happy you found what you needed and are moving forward with your life in such a positive way!\n\nGood luck to you!",

Also, if you get dull from antidepressants you should try increasing dose or change/add something else. I'm on 2 types, one is making me dull but overall better and the second gives me more energy and interest in things. Don't be scared to change things when they don't work out. ",
            "Congrats! Antidepressants changed my life, and I know they're not everyone's cup of tea, but ya gotta do what works for you. Your mental health is so important, I'm glad you received the help you deserve!",
            "Congrats! I used to think about dying 3-5+ a day. I started antidepressants and it stopped as well. I no longer take them because i couldn't make my appointments and my prescription lapsed. I'm not as \"happy\" while taking them, but I'm stable and still don't constantly think about ending it all.

If so, talk with your doctor and ask if you will experience withdrawals when/if you decide to stop taking them. SWIM was on smallest prescribed dose of Paxil and weaned off slowly and went thru terrible withdrawals. SWIM has also been thru opiate withdrawals from years of use (\u201cpeople\u201d say the worst) and it\u2019s not the same, but still terrible.

It made me feel so much better!\n\nThis is a really happy update!\n\nI ate lunch outside today and I was sitting alone when four girls approached me. They had that they had all moved from different states and countries, and asked if they could sit with me. I was prepared to eat alone or approach some people like you guys said- so this was a relief! \n\nOf course I said yes! And we really hit it off. We walked around the school after we were done and chatted. We made a group chat and agreed to sit together again tomorrow!\n\nThey're all really nice and I think we're going to be good friends.\n\nI'm really glad I made some new friends- I'm not that scared of high school anymore!\n\nThe only bad thing that happened is I lost my textbook! I looked everywhere for it but it's gone. I don't even know where I left it... I feel awful and hope my teacher isn't mad. :(\n\nBut all in all it was a great day- thank you for all the nice wishes!!!\n\nTLDR: lunch went great- four girls sat down with me and we are friends now.

I was a new kid when I started 10th grade, and if it wasn't for an extremely friendly girl who asked if I wanted to sit with her on the 2nd day of school, I probably wouldn't have made the friend group I made.

            "Missed the original, but I was in a very similar position to you once. All my friends had lunch in the other building after some adjustments early in the quarter, and I was left with sitting with one other kid that I didn't know. Clearly, he was in the exact same position, and we had to implicitly promise to each other to not miss a day of school. Ended up being pretty good friends for most of high school, then he got kinda weird. I guess that's to be expected from time to time with someone in that position, but it could have been SO much worse. Congrats! You will now appear much less weird to your peers and casual passersby.

I sat the whole year basically by myself. \n\nAfter reading that 4 girls came up to you to eat with you and that they all moved from somewhere different really made me smile big because I know that anxiety feeling.

I found one other girl I knew and we ate lunch together everyday and made some friends down line. One of the friends I made knew a girl that I would end up being best friends with and who would eventually be my first roommate in college. She's invited to my wedding next year too.

I came from a Catholic grade school to a public high school where 90% of the class came from the 2 public grade schools and most people knew each other for years prior. I had 2 kids from my grade school in my lunch so I sat with them but didn't mix well and was just awkward overall. One of the days that first week a kid from one of my classes invited me down to his table full of kids, instantly got along with all of them, he has since become my best friend and so did his group of 6 other kids.

We have so much in common!\" \n\nWe've been best friends since that day. She got engaged today and she called me before her brother. She didn't even ask me to be her maid of honor. She just started complaining on my behalf. You can make a good friend here. Just go with it. I'm leaving out the year and a half we didn't talk. My graduation night she left me alone. Friendships have ups and downs, but you'll find someone here. ",

I felt lonely and awkward, but somehow I managed to go and talk to a girl who was also sitting all alone and I asked her if she wanted to sit with me. Today, 11 years later, I am the godmother of her daughter :) ",

That's such a great result to have them come up to you!!! \n\nI actually moved from my hometown to another state and could not for the life of me make any friends there. I'd take my little one to the playground and everyone was standoffish. Went to a story time at the library and found a group where everyone was from elsewhere. Met some of my best friends. We all banded together since the locals were so weird and cliquey. ( it was high school all over again ) ",
            "this literally made me cry that is so great for you.\n\ntextbook wise, you can try and retrace your steps to find it. the school might have an online textbook though (for whatever class) so you would be able to use it. but i would definitely check the lost and found and with the teacher to see if you can get another one or if you can find it. best wishes!",

Make sure you're passing your classes, and everything else will fall into place once you get to college. \nMost of the friends you make in high school won't be your friends once it is over. It is just how it is. Focus on doing the right thing and being the best you you can be! Sorry if this was off topic, I just wish someone had told me not to take things so seriously. I made my own high school experience a living hell!"

        "selftext": "UPDATE TO http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/36618q/i_found_out_my_boyfriends_19m_surprise_present_to/\n\nWell, I've had an eventful 24 hours.\n\nSo to recap: on the 16th, my best friend Sara, who is friends with my boyfriend Alex, decided to warn me that my boyfriend was going to take me skydiving for my birthday, to which I completely freaked out about.\n\nSo I read through everyone's responses. Towards the end I was watching videos of first time skydivers over and over again, trying to psych myself up to do it, since I decided I'd probably regret it if I didn't go (even if I had a panic attack on the way there.)\n\nAlex came over the night I posted\u2013\u2013I didn't mention the skydiving to him exactly, but I did reiterate and try to explain how bad my fear of heights was\u2013\u2013and he was acting rather odd about it. He understood it completely, but just smiled and said, \"Don't worry about it, we'll get through it together.\"\n\nHe then took a really quick exit. I tried getting in touch with Sara, but she wasn't picking up her phone; she just texted me to come over at night.\n\nSo later that evening (on the 17th, the day before my birthday) I went over to Sara's, who lives in the same building as me. A few of my girlfriends/future flatmates were there. We chilled for a while, I talked about how terrified I was to skydive but that I'd decided I would give it a try. Sara had a weird, half-amused look on her face, and just replied, \"Oh it'll be over soon! He just wants to help you get over your fear!\"\n\nThen around 11 PM I got a random text from Alex telling me he was coming over. He came over to Sara's and the two of them couldn't stop giggling. At midnight on the 18th they both wished me a happy birthday\u2026 then Alex said, \"So, Sara told me you already know what I'm going to get you.\"\n\nTo which I replied, \"Yeah?\"\n\nAnd then Alex said, \"Well, in about eight days, we're going skydiving from the highest drop in Europe.\"\n\nI started visibly freaking out at this point. Alex and Sara burst into laughter. Then Sara said, \"Fuck, I can't keep this up anymore, I feel so bad. We're joking. We wanted to scare you!\"\n\nAlex grabbed my hand and he said, \"Of course I wouldn't take you skydiving! I don't want to kill you! We just really wanted to fuck with you since we knew you were catching onto us\u2026 Your real present is around the corner.\"\n\nSo I looked around the corner and there was a fishtank, all set up with a couple exotic fish, a heater, and a filter (just like I wanted)! My babies are safe and sound and I'm not getting pushed out of an airplane, reddit!\n\nHe apologised profusely and said (since a few days earlier I was beginning to to catch onto the idea that they were getting me fish) that he wanted to make sure my present was a surprise and that he had no idea how deep my fear was. He said he was extremely sorry he'd ever caused me to freak out like that, but that he was never planning on taking me skydiving.\n\nNow Alex is taking me to the Natural History Museum and we're gonna go for bubble tea and pancakes. I'm thrilled to pieces. This has been a really good birthday.\n\n**TL;DR: I'm not getting pushed out of an airplane. Instead I get adorable fish. I love my life.**",

            "That's awesome! I'm glad things worked out with you guys.\n\nAnd I gotta say, there have been a lot of posts lately about people's SOs pulling really shitty/mean pranks, and this is a situation in which the prank was actually pretty good. He can say he \"got you\" but he also takes the opportunity to re-affirm that he would never actually make you do something like that, and it all ends happily with fishes and a great birthday. \n\nSounds like you guys have a pretty good relationship! Keep it up. :)",

            "Aww that is so good to hear! I'm glad that he knows you well enough to avoid something like that, and it sounds like he has a sense of humour to boot!",
            "Yay! Much better present. I was really worried when I started reading this update. I hope you'll stop by /r/aquariums soon and show us your adorable birthday fish!",
            "Happy birthday! \n\nNext year you can go skydiving!",
            "Glad it all worked out! Is your new tank cycled? If not, do lots of water changes at first or the fish might die. /r/aquariums can give more help. ",
            "Excellent!  Happy birthday!",
            "I awwed so hard.\n\nBut it's interesting.  It sounds like you maybe learned that you might want to confront your phobia sometime.  Maybe not in a *forced* way though...",
            "FWIW, getting pushed out of an airplane (more like stepping out and getting pulled backwards) *is* an amazing way to conquer a fear of heights.\n\nI did it 3 years ago, and I was horrified in the plane on the way up, it felt like such a rickety thing and I had to put my feet out on the landing gear outside of the plane and lean backwards with the tandem instructor to 'jump' out.  \n\nAnd the moment I was out, my fear was gone.  I knew the tandem cable would hold, I knew my instructor had done this over ten thousand times without incident, I knew the chute would open because I watched him pack it meticulously.  I was just enjoying the freefall, the huge view.  I actually forgot to do my part in it and tuck my legs, so we fell a little faster than we were supposed to (instructor was not amused).  \n\nAfter that experience I don't feel the least bit of fear when I am in 'high up' situations.  But, I did this on my own, by my own choice, and was not dragged into it by others.  Keep it on your mind as an idea and do it if you decide it is worth doing.",
            "I have to wonder if that fish tank has been cycled. They usually take a month to establish the right bacteria load and chemical levels. If the fish bite the dust that'll be why - though maybe he's been cycling it in secret.\n\nHappy birthday!",
            "Well this is just adorable.",
            "Happy birthday! That's fucking hilarious, OP, I'm so glad that it was all bullshit and now you can enjoy your fishies without the fear of being dropped from an airplane!",
            "Happy ending! YAY! ",
            "Happy birthday. Terrible joke but good way to distract you from the fish",
            "Happy birthday!\n\nI'm so glad I read this, I'm so glad it worked out like this! This is an awesome update.",
            "I'd be furious if my SO made me anxious as part of a long running joke.\n\nGlad you're happy with how it worked out.",
            "Get that sweet karma at /r/Aquariums ",
            "Oh Christ, how fucking adorable",
            "FWIW, most people who have done tandem diving will tell you the height thing isn't a huge deal. You're high enough there's no sense of depth anymore -- you're just looking down on a flat painting that looks like the ground. You don't get a real sense of height until you're maybe 1000' up under the canopy. And at that point you've still got enough adrenaline to not care. \n\nIn case they decide to surprise you for your 21st birthday or something!",
            "Awesome! Were you at all disappointed that you don't get to jump out of a plane?",
            "You should have done it. Facing your fears is terrifying but afterwards is one of the most satisfying feelings.",
            "OP! You should take him sky diving for his birthday. (You can stay in the plane)",
            "I also have a big fear of heights... but for whatever reason I really want to go skydiving :|",
            "I took my sister skydiving.  She was afraid of heights too and was freaking out on the whole way up (to include the drive).  Right at the door of the plane when they were going to jump, she put her feet against the sides of the door and pushed back to keep the instructor she was attached too from jumping.  \n\nThe instructor being completely used to this, slapped her legs closed and jumped out of the airplane.  I was next to go and off I went.  It's completely surreal to be so high up and detached from the Earth.  I'm falling, but I don't feel like I'm falling (you don't get the funny feeling in your stomach).  You just feel the wind and see this massive planet flying towards you.  It was completely intense, but so calm at the same time.  I really don't know how to explain it better than that.  Once I got to the ground, my sister completely covered in tears (of joy and fear, haha) ran over and hugged me.\n\nI bet the amount of people who regret going skydiving are few and far between, and it's probably one of the safest thrill seeking hobbies around.  You have a higher chance of getting hit in the car on the way home than you do getting injured jumping (at least with a tandem jump).\n\nSpeaking of dangerous things that's not skydiving... On my way home I had so much adrenaline, that I was ready to fight two guys twice my size.  I'm a tiny guy too, and a huge pacifist, but that adrenaline....  It was a good day.",
            "Since you mentally prepared yourself to do it, you should just go for it. ",
            "Your boyfriend is such a butthead, in the best way possible. Happy birthday and enjoy your fishies! I'm not sure where you live, but my boyfriend is really into fish as well, and there's a great store in Essex County, New Jersey if that's anywhere near you.",

            "For his birthday, you should take HIM skydiving. Save the current courage you had until now for then. Who knows, mid-ground scenario maybe you get over your fear and your boyfriend lands terrified of heights.",
            "Wow. Your \"friend\" and boyfriend seem like douchebags. Using your worst fear to freak you out for days? You were scared enough to ask a bunch of strangers for advice. Why do people think shitty pranks like this are funny? They intentionally stressed you out over a period of days for no reason. Fuck them both, they owe you huge apologies.\n\nETA: wow, there are so many people here who obviously don't have phobias because it's in no way \"cute\" to cause you the anguish that they did.",

            "On the one hand, I'm glad he did actually get you what you want, but on the other hand, he caused you a great deal of unneeded anxiety, and not only that, your friend was in on it.  She knows how afraid you are of heights, and yet she participated in this...\n\nI think they were both being major dicks and I'd really rethink things, personally.",

Sadly, Vanessa died in an accident 11 years ago when the kids were very young. I started dating Nick 8 years ago and we started off very slowly for obvious reasons. Nick has always been a little more distant than anyone I'd ever been with, but he and the kids lost Vanessa so young that I understood it. \n\nAfter 3 years of dating, Nick asked me to marry him and I moved in. I've always had a really great relationship with Luke and Lila and they were happy for me to marry their dad. I had wanted an actual wedding, nothing big, but Nick really didn't want one so we got married at the courthouse with just Luke and Lila present. We had a really fast engagement, but it worked for all of us. \n\nI have loved being Luke and Lila's stepmom and officially adopted them after I found out I was pregnant with our son \"Casey\" (2/M). The kids have been so great with Casey and help out so much. Nick was wonderful during the pregnancy and had always been a really loving dad and husband. \n\nBut Nick has been pulling away a lot the last few months. He's been even more distant than usual and working late nights and going away with friends almost every weekend. I've tried talking to him, but he's been impatient with both me and the kids. I found out I was pregnant in June and am now 21 weeks pregnant with a girl. The kids are excited to have a little sister, but Nick just seems so indifferent to everything and everyone. He's been missing soccer games, Lila's birthday, doctors appointments, etc. Casey is too young to notice, but Luke and Lila are so hurt by their dad's absence. These kids are so good and they lost their mom so young and I'm infuriated that Nick is ignoring the kids like this. \n\nLast week, I finally sat Nick down and told him that he needs to stop disappearing and be more present in our lives. We're going to have another child soon and before we know it Luke and Lila will be grown up and going to college. After an hour of arguing, he screamed at me that he wished Vanessa was still alive and that I had switched places with her and died instead. He also threw in some awful comments that I need to stop pretending I'm Luke and Lila's \"real\" mom and that I'm only half the mom Vanessa was. The final straw was him saying that he never even wanted any kids with me, but did it so I'd \"keep busy and leave him alone.\"\n\nI'm so beyond hurt right now. I know I'm just his second choice, but I've always tried to honor Vanessa and tell Luke and Lila how lucky they were to have her as their mom. I love ALL of our kids more than anything and I'm just so heartbroken. Nick barely pays attention to Casey now and doesn't even acknowledge the pregnancy. He somewhat apologized this weekend and took all three kids to lunch, but he won't even look me in the eye. He seems like he wants to talk, but he doesn't say anything and I'm too upset to even be near him. \n\nI'm not sure where to go from here. Honestly, I can't even be around Nick right now and if there weren't any kids involved, I'd leave and never look back. I'm not sure if he's cheating or the thought of a fourth child is stressing him out, but I'm devastated and not sure how or why I should save this marriage, besides doing it for the kids. Any advice is desperately needed right now.\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: My husband has been distant and ignoring our kids. When I confronted him, he told me he wished I had died instead of his first wife and that I'm only half the mother she was. I'm currently pregnant and not sure how to fix this or us. ",

            "Oh man. This is so fucking heart-wrenching, and I honestly just want to give you a hug right now. You've got so much on your plate.\n\nIn your shoes, I think I would tell him that he has a choice between therapy and divorce. Get *yourself* into therapy as fast as you can- you've had your heart shattered by someone you love, you've been parenting alone, you're facing the possibility of a divorce. Even if you do couple's counselling, individual therapy needs to happen.\n\nMy only other piece of advice for you is to not leave the house. If it comes down to it, leaving can affect the divorce. Actually, no, I have another piece of advice for you- consult with a divorce attorney now, even if you're not sure you're going to go through with it, to get an idea of what you need to do during this period.",
            "He's has 2 kids with Vanessa and he's going to have 2 kids with you. Do you think he feels resentful because his new life is 'taking over' his old life? I can imagine that it hurts him tremendously to realize his ex wife is a distant memory and I can see how your new baby will serve as a physical reminder of how the years have passed. This could be a huge stretch.. I'm just speculating what my concern would be if I was in your husbands shoes. Its possible he feel very guilty and disloyal because he moved on and built a new life so he's lashing out on the person who helped him build this new life. You. \n\nI do want to say what you've done is amazing in that you helped to rebuild a home without disrespecting their bio mom's memory and I have no doubt you've been an awesome mom to your children. You do not deserve such hurtful words and whatever his reason I don't think I would be able to forget them. I really hope the best for you guys.",

It can be easy to forget all the times you were frustrated with a person.\n\nIt takes work to stay in love, to merge a family, to help people through deep heart-rending grief. For him to say that you aren't half the woman his first wife was is cruel.\n\nWho knows how Vanessa would have dealt with a partner who is being cruel and terrible like your husband is? You are competing with a memory.",
            "One thing that sticks out to me is that your child is 2 and that 11 years ago your stepdaughter would have been 2.  I wouldn't be shocked if a milestones like that has kicked up a lot of feeling about her death. Since this behavior has started up, have there been any other milestones (kids birthdays, deceased wife's birthday, their anniversary of dating or marriage, when they found out they were expecting, etc) that could have exacerbated any issues he was having?",

            "My husband lost his first wife. He used to get kinda upset around anniversaries or important dates. But after while, that stopped. He got help, he moved on. \n\nHe never, ever said anything so horribly hurtful to me. As a spouse to a widow/widower, I think we always have insecurities about measuring up to the deceased spouse. To have that thrown so awfully in your face? No. Unforgiveable. Especially since he refuses to apologize or offer to seek help. \n\nOP, I know you are in a very bad place right now. You're pregnant, and trying to keep it together. You can do this. \n\nThe way I see it, Sir Buttface has 2 options. Which you can present as you see fit, if at all. \n\n1. Grovel, apologize and seek immediate therapy.\n\n2. File divorce papers. \n\nObviously, this what I would do and you need to decide how you handle it. But for me, that level of cruelty cannot go on. How this ugliness ends is up to him. \n\nIt certainly seems possible he's having an affair. I would bring it up. \n\nIt seems more possible he's having some hefty issues that he is dumping on the rest of you. That isn't fair. \n",
            "OP he said he wished you were dead. That's scary as fuck especially if he's emotionally unstable right now. I don't know how any amount of grief or depression could excuse that or how you could ever work past what he's said. You've also said you know you were never his first choice, your husband of eleven years shouldn't make you feel like that. Don't forget need hiring the kids too. If you're worried about losing the kids, I also just wanted to add (because a lot of people have wronf ideas about adoption) you will get custody of you fight for it, because they're legally yours. Good luck, you're a great mother and person.",
            "He's had it hard losing his first wife, yes. And perhaps it's stressful and painful for him and that is, of course, understandable. \n\nHowever, I cannot imagine a situation where it is EVER acceptable to tell your loving spouse that you wish she was dead instead of your late wife. This is beyond childish, this is not okay no matter what he himself is feeling. \n\nBeyond this he only KIND OF apologized? \n\nIf you let him get away with this kind of behavior now without repercussion or action then you're only going to become his emotional punching bag. \n\nI'm not saying you need to leave him right now, but I think you should seriously consider the possibility that this relationship is not good for you. \n\nYes, he clearly needs help of some sort, but you are not obligated to just sit back and let him treat you like garbage in the meanwhile.",
            "My mom died and my dad remarried. If he ever said this to my stepmom I myself would disown him, forever, until he offered the apology of a lifetime that showed full self awareness and shame. Grief may be the explanation for his actions, but it is not an excuse, whatsoever.\n\nI want you to internalize this: everything that's happening is a reflection on who he is, it says nothing about who you are. At all. His memories are outweighing reality, and his lack of self awareness about this has caused him to lose a complete grip on everything, to the point of cruelty.\n\nIf I were in your position the next thing I would look forward to is the day you and him behave civilly for the sake of your children, with all other vestiges of your relationship kept in the past where they belong. (But I'm just an outsider with limited info who doesn't actually have to live your life so what do I know.)\n\nI'm sorry he did this though. Sincerely.",
            "My first thoughts were guilt and fear.  OP, you're having kids at the same age gap as the first wife and it feels like history is repeating itself. Nick is so fucking terrified that he'll have to go through that loss again, but at the same time, building a new life feels disrespectful to Vanessa. So, he lashes out at you so he's not losing you, he's choosing something else, and absolving his guilt about moving on at the same time. \n\nAll obviously a god awful shitty fuckface thing to do to his wife. Absolutely not an excuse, and OP, I can't tell you what course would make you happier long term. What I can tell you is that if I die and leave my young children without a mother, there is nothing I'd ever want more than for my babies to be loved as you have taken in Luke and Lila. I 1000% promise you that if Vanessa were able to, she'd be raging at and disgusted with Nick even more than you are.",
            "I could never forgive any of this. I'm so sorry. He took a shit on your lives together. He invalidated your *children* and said they are *unwanted.*\n\n>I can't even be around Nick right now and if there weren't any kids involved, I'd leave and never look back.\n\nDivorce. Do you have family that will take in you & the kids for a short time? Do you have a job? There is nothing to save here. Even if he's not cheating, he has already gone past the point of no return. He does not respect nor love you. Nobody would say something like that to someone they loved. That you're a bad mother? That he didn't want the child that is already here or your the one you're pregnant with? I can't fathom saying something so cruel. Run.",
            "Go to therapy for yourself. Demand that he goes to therapy as well. There is no saving your marriage if he isn't committed to at least trying to save it.\n\nYou should also consult with a lawyer about your options, particularly what happens to your step-kids if you were to divorce. Whatever is behind all this, he mistreated and neglected them too. I don't know that he would be a successful solo parent if the worst came to the worst.",
            "Do NOT stay for the kids. That is the worst thing you can do.\n\nAnd yes, you are Luke's and Lila's \"real\" mom. Vanessa is their \"real\" mom. Vanessa can't physicallly take care of her babies any more and I'm sure she appreciates/would appreciate you taking on that role. They deserve to have a mother, even if she was taken from them. ",

How often your husband is around, his erratic behavior (with times, dates, witnesses like if the kids saw/heard anything) any drinking or reckless behavior because if you get divorced these poor kids should not be left with him while he's going through whatever the hell he's going through.  \n  \nI'd say therapy now (individual and/or couples) or you serve the divorce papers before the year is out. I don't know how you could recover from him saying that shit. Good luck. It sounds like you're an awesome mom.",
            "After that revelation there really is no saving this marriage. As hard as it is to hear it seems he hasn't been emotionally present in this partnership for many years. I personally don't think theres anything left to salvage at this point. Im Sorry. Best of luck with the rest of your pregnancy.",
            "Nick sounds like a real douchebag to be blunt. He doesn't realize what he has. I'm sure he's beyond hurt still from his first wife but he shouldn't have ever went forward with any of the steps in life that he has with you if he wasn't able to put forth the emotional effort that you deserve.",
            "Don't stay with him just because of the kids.",
            "God, I don't even know what to say. You sound like a wonderful person and I can only imagine that wherever Vanessa is, she feels immense gratitude to you for loving her babies as her own. I can't even imagine. If I were you, I would consult a lawyer and ask them what the best course of action would be in case of the worse case scenario so that you and the babes are safe and protected from any legal action. First thing to do before that though, would be to ask Nick if he's open to therapy for the two of you, and for the whole family, maybe even some grief and coping therapy for them. Is the anniversary of her death approaching? Maybe he's acting out because of that, and the thought of a new baby might have him feeling grief over the fact that he feels it should be with Vanessa? Maybe he feels guilt over her death. I'm not sure, this is all from an outsiders perspective! \n\nEdited: truly I'm unsure if he's cheating, that wasn't even in my mind until I saw the comments. I feel like maybe he's feeling an overwhelming amount of grief or stress. Not that that justifies what he said to you AT ALL though, and you definitely need to make a statement to him that he was in the wrong for that, and that Vanessa is gone. As far as you and the kids are concerned, and even in eyes of the law since you adopted them, they ARE your damn kids. And you clearly love the hell out of them. He needs to shape the fuck up or get the hell out. You don't deserve that. And I do feel for his grief. It's so hard to lose someone you love. But you can't let the past define and control your future. He needs to leave the past behind before he gets lost in it and forgets what really matters now.",
            "Whatever is going on with him, be sure to document everything. Aside from its usefulness in the case of a divorce, having a timeline of things and it being written down may help him see how bad his behavior has become.",

            "This has nothing to do with you. It sounds like he's had a recurrence of his grief, maybe he's feeling guilt about \"moving on'. He needs to deal with this, go to therapy and apologise profusely. I wouldn't blame you if you couldn't forgive him though.   \nI feel like he probably didn't mean any of those things he said, but they were coming from a place of hurt. Still not acceptable at all though. I lost my partner too, I have one child with my late partner, and I'm now married and have another child with my husband. Personally, I have never felt like I wished I had my late partner instead of my husband. More like \" oh, I wonder how my life would be if John hadn't died\", not wishing I had one over the other.  And if I did, I sure as hell wouldn't tell him that. There is no point even thinking those things, it seems like he hasn't dealt with his grief properly, and it's not OK to take it out on you. That, or he's just a major asshole. ",

            "Here is what I would do. I'm not saying this is what you should do, I'm not saying this is the healthiest thing to do. But as a mother facing a survival situation with four children, including an infant, and a man who has revealed himself as my enemy who really would prefer I would just disappear, this is what I would do.\n\nFirst, I would give him room to backpedal and restore the relationship to a superficially friendly footing without any big discussions or analysis or apologies or revisiting the argument. I would say I know some awful things were said in the heat of the moment the other day, but I want to put them behind us because we have such a good life together, and I don't want to discuss it, I just want to get back to normal.\n\nSecond, I would give him space to do whatever bullshit he wants to do, whether it's to avoid day-to-day life, have an affair, or whatever. I wouldn't ask where he's been or where he's going. I'd handwave his absence with the kids (\"You know how busy Dad is, Lila. He works so hard for us.\") I would become so pliantly accepting of his bullshit, as long as it isn't actively imposed on me, that our home life would become relatively serene.\n\nThird, I would get my ducks in a row while the younger children progress to school age and the older ones get to the moving-out stage. Get a qualification, get some money together, do some part time or volunteer work to get references and become employable, all that. Get all the papers together you'll need for the divorce. Start building friendships and a social life that are outside the marriage.\n\nFourth, when the older two move out and the younger two are at school, I would get the hell out.\n\nHe's played a long con on you, OP, so I would play one on him. Otherwise you're going to spend the next few years in custody battles, being villainised for trying to take a poor widower's kids, and struggles to rebuild your financial and professional life, and he'll probably fight you for custody of children he doesn't even want in order to avoid child support. It will suck big time no matter how you do it, but in your shoes, I would play it smart and come out with the least pain I could, for me *and* the kids.",

            "Are your kids, mainly Casey, as the baby is not born yet, near the age that Luke and Lila were when Vanessa passed? \n\nHe could be regressing and building a defense without knowing, because his marriage with you may be in a similar place to where his and Vanessa's marriage was before she passed.\n\nThis indicates that he didn't properly cope with her death, and often traumas can resurface regardless of external circumstances. Even if timing isn't similar, I would think this has to do with inability to cope with her passing. ",

He's deliberately playing the role of the \"bad guy\" because it's expedient to that end.\n\nI've done the same in personal life. I lost a child (not mine biologically but he was a son to me). I wound up leaving my marriage and children behind. I had zero self-worth. I was satisfied with being hated. I actually thought it was best for all involved. Anger can be empowering, so I let my family hate me.\n\nI came close to suicide, which is also easier when everyone hates you.\n\nI'd worry about your husband. Try not to take his words to heart.

That doesn't completely justify his action, wishing death on you is still terrible even if it's because he's so scared of it happening. It's like he's trying to use reverse psychology on Fate.\n  \nHe really needs therapy again, and you need to tell him he does, if he wants to save this marriage.",

I would be devastated to have been told those things - this is on him to atone 100%. No matter how much mending he may still need, he was wrong to say those terrible things.

You and the kids are suffering because of whatever is happening in Nick's life. \n\nIs that a fair synopsis?  If it is,  then it is so important that you find out what is going on with Nick.   If you can get him to communicate with you about that,  then at least you'd know what you are up against. It could be anything,  right?  Work pressures,  midlife crisis,  an affair,  drug addiction,  etc.  Whatever it is,  you need to know.   Maybe you and Nick can accomplish this first step on your own,  but I'd recommend marriage counseling.   By yourself if he refuses,  but preferably together.  A really good counselor can help you both work through the mess,  find a foundation to rebuild on,  and repair the marriage.   Also can help you with the decision to end the marriage if it comes to that. \n\nJust from personal experience,  the not being able to look you in the eye.... I do that when I am horribly ashamed of something I've said or done.   I think it's possible that Nick is regretting those words and is sorry and ashamed of himself.  He just hasn't been able to gather enough courage to actually express that yet. \n\nGood luck to you and your family. \n\nEdit: after reading the other comments,  I totally agree that your marriage is sort of repeating what happened to Nick and Vanessa.   Love,  marriage,  a son,  a daughter..... And then the loss of his wife.   Could it be that he sees the parallel and is subconsciously afraid that he'll lose you,  too.

Perhaps your pregnancy is bringing that to the front of his mind and he isn't good at communicating his feelings leading to his blow up. It could also be depression, maybe suggest couples counseling, if you don't think he would seek help alone. Another thought that crossed my mind, could your husband be using drugs? Some of the things you said made me think of someone hiding substance abuse. \nI'm sorry he said something so cruel to you, it's definitely uncalled for and if it gets worse or continues into abuse ( even verbal abuse however this was said in the heat of the moment and is out of character for your husband) please don't hesitate to remove the children from the home (you did adopt them) and leave until he gets sorted out.

And if he gave you some bs about too much chaos at home and he needed some quiet time I'm still now buying that.  \n\nDon't forget, when men get scared, they get angry.  \n\nSo he was avoiding you and the kids and when you confronted him, he lashed out.   He's hiding something, don't chalk it up to some vague emotional issue up in the sky somewhere that you can't see.   \n\nI also think your husband is jealous of the attention you're receiving for being pregnant.   That's why he most likely is doing whatever he's doing.   He's lashing out to make you go away so he can get everyone to feel sorry for him and soak up all the sympathy.   Yea, she left me, I was such a good husband to her, blah blah blah.   Except this time your kids are older and know what's going on.

He needs to put Vanessa behind him and realize what is in front of him, while still being able to keep Vanessa's children balanced and recovering as well.\n\nAfter my mom's suicide when I was 25 and my youngest brother was 7, our family grief therapist taught us many things about grief. One thing in particular was that we will all re-live her passing at various stages in our lives, more so for the 7 year old but us adults as well. This very well may apply to him, too.\n\nTackle the grief therapy, and hire a PI to see wtf he started doing in his time away from you. He's probably depressed and being an asshole about his grief by pushing away the people who love him most, and very possibly cheating, too,.. somehow.\n\nDon't engage with him, remain aloof and pretend his actions and whereabouts don't bother you to keep the drama to a minimum, grab a few therapy sessions for yourself, and maybe some for the kids too - grief is huge and can drown entire families - protect yourself and the babies, and get yourself the support to remain present and supportive for all four kiddos. \n\n",

She realized that he was generally unhappy with his life and having an adult sized temper tantrum. I recommend reading it. \n\nJust going off what you have said here, I think your husband is hurting and having a temper tantrum of his own. Think of the thousand of ways he has shown you over the years that he loved you and your family. He is hurting and was trying to hurt you as well.  It still sucks even knowing that, particularly since he stabbed at your insecurities. \n\nI would suggest individual and couples counseling for both of you.

It's possible that you just tore open the festering wound, and let out all the nasty shit inside. Sometimes, after an event like that, one can look at themselves, and see how much trouble they are actually in. I hope your husband can do that.\n\nIn order to qualify for the pass, he needs to (preferably unprompted) apologize to you. This would indicate that he has, in fact, looked at himself, and realized that he took out his hurt on you, and that it was wrong.\n\nAdditionally, he needs to go to some kind of therapy, or counseling, or someone, and talk with them about his feelings. Let him go on his own, or go with him, but this isn't couple's counseling. This is him needing help to heal his own injuries.\n\nIf he refuses either of those, then things may not be salvageable.",

Don't force him to therapy but suggest strongly that he go. You should also go to therapy your own self, and maybe even marriage counseling. If he isn't willing to really try, really make an effort to atone for his hurtful words, there is probably no saving your marriage. ",

I would be expecting he either gets himself some therapy as well as couples therapy and make some changes or that's it. If I'm honest, I don't think I'd feel his words could be taken back if I were in your position so I would probably already be looking at the most amicable way to split. My focus would be the smoothest transition for the children. If you do split, do not remove Luke/Lila from your life as it'll be like they've lost a mother all over again. They are old enough that you can speak a bit more openly and explain what's happening (obviously don't bad mouth their father even though it may be hard as it's ultimately his words/actions that's done this, but try to be as honest and upfront as possible and be available to speak with them and spend time with them if they need/want it).\n\nI am so sorry this has happened to you and the kids.

This is his damage and this is entirely on him to make amends and fix if indeed it can be fixed or saved.  He better crawl, and crawl through broken glass to get you back.  I understand he had a loss, and a trauma and he's grieving, but grief and trauma doesn't excuse you hurting and abusing someone else like that without provocation or cause because of your pain.

Specifically designed to deal the most damage. I stopped talking to him. I had never been around depression before and had no idea how it really manifests.  It was a particularly bad episode. When he came out of that one, he was apologetic to me but didn't grovel or beg me back. He took time to explain how depression works - I did some reading too - it's scary stuff. It's a complete inability to feel - for him it made him feel almost powerful - he could hurt me (with words) and there would be nothing I could say to hurt him back. But also, in that mindset, he rationalizes that I'm better off without him anyway so if he hurts me and makes me leave, he's doing me a favor. \n\nReading about your husband reminds me a LOT of the time. I'm NOT a psychologist so I can't diagnose him but I would bet good money there is some mental health issue happening - others have suggested PTSD too. \n\nI came back to him on the understanding that a) I did not trust him (at the time) and he would have to deal with the consequences of that breach of trust and b) he needed to actively seek help. \n\nTo this day, he knows that I am here to support him as long as he continues to actively manage his disease. I also told him he gets 1 \"depression made me say it\" card - and he's used it up. I won't stand for being torn apart like that again. But, so far with his active management he hasn't hit another low point like that.\n\nNot everyone can stay with someone battling mental illness and if it's not something you're up for its not a sign of weakness on your part. It's exhausting supporting my fiance at times - and sometimes the knowledge that he may never get better makes me want to quit. But I love him and and I will support him *as long as* he's trying to help himself as well. \n\nIf I were in your shoes I would basically lay it out - therapy (individual AND couples) or divorce. I'd meet with an attorney to get your ducks in a row before making any kind of ultimatum because reality is - he may chose divorce. Like an alcoholic - you can't *make* someone seek help for their mental illness, but you don't have to stay and watch them destroy themselves either. \n\nYou seem like an amazing mom, and an amazing human being. Whatever choice you make I am certain that it will be a good choice and will come from a place of love and selflessness because people like you aren't capable of making selfish choices. ",

            "One thing I haven't seen mentioned is that it sounds more like depression than an affair.  Being distant, irritable, saying mean and hurtful things all sound like depression.  \n\nMen in particular are taught they don't get *depressed* so they tend not to talk about it when they feel down.  Anger is the easiest 'go to' emotion. \n\nI really feel for you - and honestly the whole family.   You must take care of yourself and I seriously agree that therapy for yourself is needed.  \n\nJust be mindful there is more than one possibility for the behavior. \n\nWishing you the best!",

This isn't an excuse to say reprehensible things to you.  I would also consult an attorney because he may try to sabotage the relationship.

I'd create the right moment and say something like \" Hey, I know that you are a great father and husband and your recent distance/uninvolvement is way out of character for you. Is there something going on that I can help with even if that help is to just listen and help you feel like I've got your back?\"    If you think it's appropriate you could even involve the kids in the conversation.

He wanted his wife and the family they created, he didn't want to create a new life with someone else. What other choice do some have? Be alone or start over.   \n\nHe didn't marry her but he was with his ex-gf for a couple of years before finally ending it because he couldn't move past his ex. SHE was his first choice and in his mind his only choice. He left his ex-gf and although he's still very depressed over the loss of his wife, he acts very different and has said how relieved he is to stop having to try and fall in love when the love of his life died.   \n\nI skimmed through the other comments and didn't see anyone mention how maybe he just doesn't want to pretend anymore.

I've struggled with depression for most of my life, and the behaviours you are describing sound similar to some that I have exhibited when feeling depressed/bleak/suicidal.\n\nUnfortunately I can't even give any advice on it, because when I'm in the thick of an episode like that, even human interaction from a loved one, or someone reaching out telling me \"it will all be better\" just makes me feel worse and more detached. \n\nI would consider talking to a counselor, even just by yourself at first (pushing these sort of things on people can backfire) to learn some coping strategies, or better ways of reaching out to your husband.\n\nWhen you lose a loved one that close to you, it's human nature to find the \"blame\". Often people point it inwards, but when they can no longer take it, they will go through a calloused, emotional shut-down and become distant, irritable, and even lash out at the ones they love.\n\nI think your husband is still hurting deeply from what happened to him, he has regrets, and he has not moved on/properly dealt with it all yet. Sometimes people bottle it up, put it on a shelf and try to cover it up/run away. But it eventually comes to the surface.\n\nLife is cruel like that. I wish you the best of luck. Be there for your kids right now, and don't take anything outrageous he might be saying to heart.",
            "Other posts are suggesting he might be cheating, based on his behavior. But it sounds to me like he never *really* grieved the loss of Vanessa and this is running-away behavior because he can't deal. My guess is that he is distraught at your new pregnancy and that he feels like he's not honoring her memory, but he's projecting it onto you. \n\nRegardless, it's clear to me that Nick is in a lot of pain and can't handle it. The things he said are incredibly hurtful, but they don't reflect on you. That's his pain and sadness speaking. And though /r/relationships does often jump straight to it, I really do think Nick needs to see a therapist in a bad way.\n\nThis is a hard stuaton for both you, Nick and the kids, but don't give up yet. There's hope and a path through grief. You guys just need someone to show you the way. ",

            "He needs professional help. He may have been raised in a 'mean' house, like I was. Because of my upbringing, I always can think of the cruelest, cleverest, most cutting thing to say when I'm fighting, because thats what i was taught will 'win' the fight. After a few decades out of that environment, it isn't the *first* thing I think of, but it's always there if I want it. It's like I have a radar for others' pain points. It's awful. Even when I was a kid, I said devastating things during fights that I really didn't mean at all. \n \nWe have this myth that something said in anger or deep emotional stress or drunk must be true, as if overwhelming feelings and loss of control expose our dirty secrets and make us unable to lie. But think about this: are you *really* unable to lie if drunk or angry? Also what we say may be true-ish, but only in that nanosecond before we rerlect on our words. Not to mention, our brains often lie to us--mental illness can cause us to believe deeply ideas that are not true. I have wanted to rid the earth of my terrible existence and give my husband and kids a \"chance at real happiness\" without my stupid failure face around. I have wanted to die; I've looked at guardrails on the highway to crash into; and I've looked at bridges to drive off of. I got help and I got better and I know how real the lies felt.\n \nI think he may be having an affair of sorts--an affair with the idea of suicide. He has pulled away from everyone, won't bond with your youngest, and has verbally burned bridges with you. He is trying to destroy his life, either figuratively or literally. The counterpart of gloomy depression is angry depression, but your brain is still whispering terrible \"truths\" to you. Until you get a professional trail guide to walk with you out of that wilderness, it surrounds you and will kill you. \n \nAnd if I'm right and he gets better and swears what he said wasn't true and that he loves you and that he's sorry, believe him.\n \n\n",

            "It sounds like he's going through something that you may not even be able to guess. Something like a midlife crisis where he's reassessing where he is in life and how he got there as a man as a husband and as a father. It's nothing that can't be fixed if he wants to. As you said he's not only taking it out on you but also all of the kids so it's definitely something going on with him and you're the one that's closest to him so he's hurting you the most. What I would suggest to you is to be patient and continue to be as loving as possible. Pray for him that his heart would change and he would become that husband and father he was once again. He will only be more of a miserable person if you lose your patience and retaliate. You've got to be the strong one right now and you can be!! Us women have a strength and resilience that sometimes we don't realize. Love begets love just as hate begets hate. Be the strong one.. take the higher road and be patient. He didn't mean what he said to you and I know if you're loving with him he will feel the weight of the guilt about what he said to you and how he's treated you in this time. You guys also need counseling through the good times and the bad. For all of you married couples reading here you have to give your marriage preventive maintenance; it is a journey and only the strong prayerful ones last through it. So be strong!",

            "Sounds like he's going through something. You've been with him for 8 years. So I have to ask if he was like this before now?\nIf not, then there has to be something stressing him out or some medical condition. \n\nI say that because while he may grow distant from you, the same wouldn't be true for his children. \n\nPersonally, I think taking a heavy handed approach to getting him back on track will do more damage. This makes things harder since generally men don't like opening up about problems. They (we) prefer to try to figure out a solution on our own. Unfortunately we can get a bit testy while trying to solve these issues. \n\nSo you may need to *gently* let him know that you've noticed that there may be something going on and his behavior has changed. He may open up to you. You may also want to suggest that he seek professional help to get him through whatever he's going through. Explain that his behavior is affecting the children and you just want things to be okay with the kids. \n\nHe may (will) give some resistance at first. But may give in after thinking it through and realizing that others are noticing that there's a problem as well. ",

            "My Dad died when I was 5, she remarried when I was 8... and my stepdad took on three of us.  The first year or two was ok, then I remember just praying between the ages of like 10 and 18 that they would divorce.  I loved and needed both of my parents and I didn't know what that all looked like, but the constant tension in my house made me feel sick all the time.  I didn't want to be anywhere but my room most of the time.  There are similarities in the issues between them as the issues you're having, but not exactly.  No one had to deal with additional children either should they split so I understand this is more complicated.  However, not only was this detrimental at a young age to my confidence and backbone... but it lead to so many problems I'm still dealing with now as a 33yr old single mother of one.  The issues that are coming up over and over from the turmoil I was in... ugh.  It wasn't so bad we should have been on Jerry Springer, but it was enough to do damage to everyone.  They eventually divorced when I was like 25 but there were huge serperations in there after I went to college, it was totally different those last 10 years how apart they were.  I spend a couple weekends a month seeing my stepdad still of course.... In summary, even those stepchildren that love you so much, just want peace more than anything.  As a fellow mother, I think I would leave to create more peace for everyone.... but I only know how to be a mother, not a wife.  I just don't know how you reconcile in these conditions.\nFinal Note- My parents have been dating again for 2 years maybe more.  It took time apart to heal for them to figure out how to communicate.",

            "In life it is hard to not take what happens to us personally, but that is what we need to do.  We must realize that rarely things happen because of us.  You are a wonderful woman and just know that your husband said those mean statements not because of who you are but because of a mental issue.  He is going through some type of problem in his head.  I am by no means excusing what he did, merely explaining what I think of the situation.  His actions aren't a reflection of you but more so a reflection of his own mental degradation.  Whether the marriage is salvageable is up to you. In many instances you are going to have to be the bigger person/take the high road and if/when you salvage the marriage he may never even acknowledge your sacrifice but such is life.  It is tough.  ",
            "I don't think something is up with him as others have stated but more that he is snapping, because his new life with you is, for lack of better wording, replacing that of his and Vanessa's life and he maybe almost feels guilty for it. He's not allowing himself to be happy. ",
            "She died right after the birth of their second child from the math.  You're reaching the point in this relationship that he was at in the last one at the time when she passed.  He could be distancing himself from you because he is afraid to feel that hurt again.  As a new dad to a second child, he probably started to have a lot of the same feeling which, in his memory are probably tied to the grief of losing her because he was probably still feeling the new-ness of the second child when she was taken.  Just a thought.",
            "Honestly this sounds like it has very little to do with you. Hopefully that will make it easier for you to stay connected with the kids while their dad is going through some shit. He sounds like he's stopped enjoying being involved with any events or things he used to do and clearly he's been thinking about the past and has a lot of hurt still left. It's natural for him to still have some wounds, but it's not okay the way he is dealing with them. \n\n I think the easiest way to help the entire situation is to recognize the battle he's going through within himself (which may be depression or anxiety or just grief that never got dealt with). This doesn't excuse his actions but it may help you deal with the hurt he's throwing your way and make it easier to try to just lovingly help him get help with a therapist weekly and go from there.",

            "How did she die? Also, this guy sounds like a psycho. I know it's hard to lose someone, but telling someone you supposedly love that you wish they were dead and that they only had children with you to shut you up is not. Normal ",
            "OP you're getting some wonderful advice here so I really just want to reiterate what a lot of other's have already said. We all grieve differently. Despite what we're told there's no prescribed \"do it this way\" for dealing with the death of a spouse. Loss on that level isn't something that ever really goes away, which you clearly know and are very sensitive to, and even when you think you're \"done\" with it, it can rear its head years and years after the physical loss has happened.\n\nYour husband sounds like he's in an immense amount of pain right now and he has no idea where to put it. People have already commented on the symmetry of your situation and that of his previous marriage and I'm sure he draws comparisons and thinks about her every day. What she missed, what the kids missed, what he missed with her. How could he not? I truly don't think that cast's any reflection on his feelings for you, I really, really don't. \n\nWhat I'm wondering is if some of his issues are stemming from fear. As another poster pointed out the time frame of his first marriage and yours is pretty close. Is it possible he's dealing with a huge amount of fear over losing you the way he lost his first wife and he's insanely overcompensating the other way by distancing himself? He may not even realize that's what's happening. Everything he's doing, sleeping in another room, cutting himself off from you and the kids feels so much like putting up walls and distance so he doesn't have to go through another trauma when something bad happens to you.\n\nObviously we don't know all the details of your fight and without a doubt what he said to you was totally awful. But I don't know if it should be the thing that defines whether or not your marriage ends. There is no question that was the absolute worst thing he could have said to you under any circumstances but I'm positive it really is worth getting to the heart of where those words came from and why they came out at all. That's not to cast any responsibility for his outburst on you, you in no way deserved that.\n\nCouples counseling is absolutely a necessity here. You two simply aren't communicating anymore. It happens and it can be helped and fixed. You are dealing with incredibly deep seated and very tragic issues here and I know you know there's no quick fix here but I think based on what you've said that this relationship, this life is worth fighting for.\n\nYou truly sound like a wonderful person who really deserves happiness and a good relationship and you've done something amazing in becoming a part of this family. Please hang in there and see if its possible to work through this and please, please let us know how you're doing.",
            "Any chance he's distancing himself from you because he's got an unconscious fear history will repeat itself? You have a 2 year old boy together, you're about to have a girl together. These kids have roughly the same spacing as Luke and Lila. Two years after Lila was born, Vanessa was gone. \n\nSo therapy, together and apart, and re-evaluate from there. What he said to you was horrible. If he won't go to therapy, I hope you do, and I hope you go.",
            "Wow. Just wow. I'm so sorry. I don't know how you're still sane after hearing some of those words other than to say that you're a tough lady. You must know that he said those things to emotionally cripple you and I hope you don't let it. Big virtual hug.",
            "After reading your story, I was really hurt as if I was you. You are pregnant too fragile with painful words. What kind of husband is that? All I can advise is to have a serious conversation with him. Ask him why the changes and etc. But if he is not willing to open up and continue being a jerk, I think it's time to say goodbye. Focus on your baby instead. It is not good for a pregnant woman to feel emotional pain. If he doesn't want you to become a mother to his children, then fine. He's being abusive to your patience and love. Your baby inside your womb is much important. Stay positive and happy. Your true love is your baby. Wishing you all the best in the world and congratulations for having a baby girl. :)",

            "I once witnessed an experience, just like yours. My father had said almost the same thing to my mother. \"I wish you, your whole family, and our son never existed, so I wouldn't hate to care about what y'all think anymore.\"\n\nI was 12? at the time, and I hadn't known what it meant to be so resentful towards family. After all, I had only known love from everyone in it. This includes members of my family that are distant from me in itself, after having relatives in Paris, France - Saigon, Vietnam - Nashville, TN - ect. What hate could arise from such a loving family that chose to stick together and work things out, day by day to ensure the safety and success of the young?\n\nNow I am 18, just starting college, and I can truly see the efforts my parents have made for me. They chose to stick through a very rough marriage, with a kid that always hated not just the immediate family, but the whole family, because they knew that I was the determining factor on whether they stayed or not. Whether my parents divorced, or stuck through it because of me. I was the only child too, spoiled out of my mind, to an extent where I wouldn't have to care because my parents still loved me.\n\nYou see where this is going, right? I'm not trying to be the most selfish being on the planet right now, because I'm not making this post about myself. I'm doing this for the kids. Think about it, he's got 2 kids to worry about, plus the one that's on the way (congratulations, btw). What would you think is better for them? \n\nMy parents chose to stay together, and fix their marriage (sorta) in order to keep me in school, show me that love can be hard sometimes, and honesty is the best policy. They truly loved me in the aspect of education, loyalty, and the fact that you can always learn from a bad experience. aka their marriage.\n\n**TL;DR** I strongly suggest you stay together, and work things out. Like that one 'Family Guy' episode said, \"I'm the best you got!\" Learn from the experience. Start slow. Cool, calm, collected. Do it for the kids, so they can experience. Teach them to fall, so that they can learn to get up.",

            "\"Last week, I finally sat Nick down and told him that he needs to stop disappearing and be more present in our lives.\"\n\nWhile you are absolutely correct in thinking that, saying it to someone who obviously has mental health problems (I would assume a personality disorder of some sort) is not ok.  People with personality disorders are like drowning people; If they want to be saved, and you are trained to save them then everything can work out.  Most people, however, are not trained to save someone with a personality disorder, and most people with personality disorders do not want to be saved.  It really seems to me that you are not equipped to deal with your husband's problems, and that is ok.  Would you try to save a drowning person who doesn't want to be saved with no life raft and no lifeguard experience?  NO!  You need to protect yourself and your kids (they aren't trained in this area, either).  Don't try to save your husband.  Unless he apologizes profusely and makes drastic changes to his behavior, you need to get the divorce and distance yourself from him.  \n\nAlso, even though he thinks you are over-stepping by being there for his biological, and your adopted kids, you are 1000% not!  you adopted them so they are, by law, your responsibility.  Do your best to take them away from his toxicity until he figures things out (which will probably never happen as it is very difficult to recover from a personality disorder).  Look, the dude is isolating himself anyway so let him isolate, but don't give him the opportunity to bring his toxicity into you and your kids' lives.  This will be very hard on your kids, by the way.  This is a tough life lesson, but one that is essential that they learn at this point.  \n\nAll this being said, you really need to analyze your own actions before making any major decisions.  Make sure you didn't do anything to hurt him and drive him to this behavior.  Hell, even ask him if you did anything.  One of the last things you want in this kind of situation is for you to get a divorce, take away his kids, etc. only to realize in hindsight that it was actually something that you did that pushed him to this behavior.  Was he working too hard (both at home and at work)?  Were you actually getting between him and his relationship with his kids?  These kinds of questions are important.  From your writing, it seems like you have treated him well, but writing can only really tell so much.\n\nStill, if he doesn't apologize and change his behavior, then it doesn't matter if you did something wrong.  His behavior right now is dangerous (in an emotional way) for you and the kids. You may both need therapy, or maybe only one of you needs it.  Just try to keep in mind that relationships are still two-way streets, even if one of the parties is extremely out-of-line.\n\nAnd something for later on down the road to think about... Try to objectively reflect back on this and figure out how you may have missed warning signs of this kind of thing coming.  It really sounds like he never got over his first wife, and that should have shown in some way before now.  When you do this, do not, under any circumstance, make yourself feel guilty or beat yourself up in any way.  You may do that unintentionally which happens to the best of us, but don't think you need to feel bad about this in order to process it.  \n\nBest of luck to you.",
