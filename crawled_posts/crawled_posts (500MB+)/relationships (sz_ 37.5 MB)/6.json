        "selftext": "OP:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i\\_30f\\_want\\_to\\_discuss\\_moving\\_in\\_with\\_boyfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b820za/i_30f_want_to_discuss_moving_in_with_boyfriend/)\n\nThanks for all the advice, I ended up broaching the topic last week.\n\nAs mentioned in the first post both my boyfriend and I have been hinting around the topic but hadn't directly discussed it. I was still on the fence about bringing it up myself when my boyfriend made a comment about how he's excited for us to live together (one day). I just responded with, \"Well did you want to? My lease is up in July.\" and he said that he did.\n\nIt was before work when it happened so we left it at that for the day and got together that evening to work out details. I expressed to him at that point that while I would love living with him that my concern was that I wouldn't be able to contribute equally and I didn't want him feeling taken advantage of. He in turn expressed that he'd never want to put me in a bad position financially and that we could easily figure out something that would be fair while still putting me in a better financial position.\n\nWe ended up deciding we'd go with a lump sum monthly that I'll pay to him to cover all the costs, rather than splitting bills. The monthly amount he offered at first I actually upped because I didn't think he was being fair to himself, and it was still less than what I pay now. He seemed happy with that and it definitely works for me!\n\nHe keeps mentioning how excited he is to move in together, and came to my apartment last week to help me clean for photos to show it! We're deciding together what we'll keep out of my furniture vs. his, what we'll get rid of and what we're going to store. He's also mentioned a couple renovations he wants to get done around the condo so we're going to go together to pick stuff out and make it a summer project. :)\n\n**TL;DR:** Boyfriend gave me an opening to ask about moving in so I seized it. All went well and we'll be moving in together in June!\n\n**Edit:** Wow... this really blew up! Thanks to everyone for the super kind words. To address the most common comment here; we did discuss splitting proportionally but ultimately decided to go with a lump sum. I definitely see benefits to proportional splitting but for where we are right now and my financial situation I prefer a lump sum. It's still significantly less than what I'm paying now, and it wont fluctuate as the weather changes so I can count on what I owe monthly not changing.\n\nMany people have mentioned chores as well. My boyfriend and I tend to do chores together. I mean right now with two separate places we each have our things that are more our responsibility but when I've stayed with him for a stretch of time we've just balanced together. He doesn't know how to cook but wants to learn so we cook meals together and then clean up together. We will each have our own washroom at his place (I've already taken over the main washroom and he uses the en suite). He volunteers at a local animal shelter once a week so those days I clean and cook if I'm around. But generally speaking we just treat doing chores as an opportunity to spend time together and be productive. :)",

            "Aw, this is adorable! You guys sound like you communicate well and really care for each other, good luck!",
            "Congrats! My SO and I did something similar, and I wanted to pass on something I wish I'd learned sooner: if you don't have a rental contract, you should put a utility bill in your name. You'll need that credit history, and it will come in handy for legal identification purposes (like if your state requires a copy of a utility bill, rental agreement, or mortgage in order to get a new driver's license).",
            "Awesome! As a homeowner from a purely financial perspective of course it makes sense for him. He is paying 100% of all those costs right now anyways so anything you contribute saves him money. Obviously he had other reasons to want to live with you as well.",
            "\"We are deciding\" \"we will keep\" \"we are going to do together\"\n\nthis is how i expect updates in this subreddit\n\ncongrats",
            "Congrats! I\u2019ve been in your situation twice... and split differently each time. \n\nFirst: He talked me into moving in for financial reasons since it\u2019s quite expensive where we live. Since I moved into his apartment which was more than double mine it would have cost me more to move in. He convinced me that the fair way was to split rent weighted by our incomes which decreased rent for both of us.  Then we would alternate paying for regular meals out and he treated me once a month to a fancy meal for our month-aversary that I wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford. \n\nSecond: He owned his home and felt like it was taking advantage of me to have me help pay down the mortgage when it was technically his house. I also didn\u2019t \nwant to feel like a burden but he said he would have paid the mortgage whether I lived there or not. So instead since he knew I wanted to contribute, he suggested that I put my old rent amount into a fund that we used for vacations and fun outings. It meant that we could go on nice vacations together that I wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford otherwise. And I could feel like I added to his life too while making fun experiences for both of us. \n\nMost importantly... it\u2019s good to remember to re-evaluate! Maybe every 6 months just to make sure that whatever you choose still feels fair for each of you.",
            "The most important thing is communicating expectations and needs - something you both have clearly managed here! One of the things I keep reminding myself as I get older is that financial equality isn't always super important - there are a million valuable ways to contribute to someone's life, and they're all valid.\n\nRecently a friend reached out to ask me if it was weird that her partner frequently cooks meals from scratch for her, but she never reciprocates - partially because she hates to cook. I suggested other ways to return the favour are also  usually appreciated - paying for a takeout night, asking if she can bring anything or help out, offering to pick up and pay for the items he needs to make said dinner, offering to clean up, etc. There are lots of ways to help each other out, and this is only going to help both of you financially in the end!",
            "Just chiming in because I've been there, and I was struggling so hard to be \"fair\" that I was putting every penny I had into bills and he had tons of disposable income left over.\nAfter we talked it out we actually decided it was more fair to try a third option .. besides lump sum or 50/50 split, which  would be a percentage split.\n\nYou have to play with the numbers a bit but for a very simple example, \n\nIf you make 1000 per month and he makes 3000 per month, and rent is 1200.. he can pay 30 percent of his income per month, 900. Then you pay 30 percent of yours, 300. It sounds like he is paying alot more but really it's pretty fairly split as you both then have the same percentage for fun money, ect. \n\nIf you just eyeball a lump sum you might end up agreeing to pay 500 per month to his 700 because it SOUNDS more equal, but then you're actually putting 50 percent of your income into housing and he's doing closer to 20% which sucks for you.",
            "When my now husband and I first moved in together, he had a great job that paid all of his expenses and then some, and I had a very shitty job that barely covered rent and a phone bill. He was gracious and generous, and I paid about 1/3 of our bills and he covered the rest while being able to save.\n\nYears later, I made more than him and I covered most of the bills while he did what he could. The rest went to savings.\n\nNow, he is again the primary bread winner. But we\u2019ve saved a lot through the lean years and we make it work as best we can.\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of sharing your life with someone. Each of you will have ups and downs. But you work together and make it happen.",
            "Nice. Same situation with my lady. I was thinking I\u2019d just ask for a standard monthly contribution rather than trying to split each bill. Glad it works for you.",
            "Yay! I love a happy update.",
            "I love that you're also picking furniture items from both people ... Making it a shared space with everyone's possessions is so important to making you both feel at home. \n\nAnd also wise to not ditch everything you won't be bringing over. It may feel pessimistic, but it's really just pragmatic to hold on to all your duplicate items. You never know why or how you might need them in the future (besides just the pessimistic possibly of a breakup--there a plenty of other occasions where backup furniture could be useful!)",
            "You guys sound so compatible! That's amazing! Congratulations!",
            "sounds like you're doing well with boundaries and communication. yay!\n\nkeep in mind that you are helping him build equity in his condo - he'd be paying that mortgage whether you were living there or not. \n\nIt's wonderful that you want him to feel like he's being treated fairly, and that's very important. But since it is his condo that he'd be paying for regardless, know that any amount you're contributing is lowering his expenses and helping him build equity. So make sure that this is also a great financial move for you, too. if you're paying him the same you're spending on your own, it's actually not working out that fairly for *you.* Be fair to him, yes. Also remember to be fair to yourself. even if you're only contributing $500 a month, you're reducing his monthly expenses by 80-100% of the amount you're contributing. So make sure your expenses will also be lower as a result of this move. Especially since, if it doesn't work out, you'll be the one moving, not him.",
            "This is essentially the exact conversation I had with my girlfriend when we moved in together.  I understand that I make more than her and weighted our rent to reflect that. Also she has student loans and I would love to help her pay those of faster even if that means I'm covering more of the rent than her.",
            "Awww , it sure put a smile on my face :D",
            "i'm glad things worked out! it sounds like your communication is really strong!",
            "Yay, happy update! Have fun moving in together!",
            "This is exactly what I did with my gf when we moved in. I currently make 3x more than her but she will make 2x my salary one day. We agreed on a set amount each month and I take on all the bills. It actually works out great for us even though I'm paying more. Having larger lump sums in my paycheck has allowed me to pay off debt faster from my student loans.",
            "Just make sure you don't rely on him too much in the future. You seem to be aware of this now, which is great! But try and move up where you work and make a more stable income in the next year so that if things don't work out with your bf, you have the money to look for a place elsewhere. \n\nNot trying to be pessimistic about your relationship. Just wanna emphasize the importance of taking care of YOU first and making sure you'll be ok no matter what other people do around you.",
            "Congratulations.  I\u2019m so happy for you two. Way to be open and honest with each other.",

            "You guys sound like a great pair! My husband contributes more financially as well (he makes more than double I do), but he's never made me feel guilty about it. I know if our financial situations were reversed, I would do the same for him! I always try to give extra when I have it (giving him my bonuses from work and such). I also do the majority of the cleaning, which he never expects I just feel like it's a way I can contribute to the household and it's free! You guys aren't just roommates, you are a team. Best of luck to you both! :)",
            "I'm glad things worked out well for you and your BF.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy wife and I started living together back in college. We shared some costs during college. Once we graduated, we decided to get a house a year after. Due to some circumstances, I became the sole bread maker of the house. However, my wife took care of everything else that going on in the house while I focus on making money and killing spiders/ants/moths.",

Lol\n\nHonestly I feel like she pays to much as she loves to cook and is a clean freak. I keep a tidy house but it\u2019s not up to her standards, so she does everything and seems to like it..",
            "This is great! Good for you! My boyfriend [30m] and I [27f] have just started discussing moving in together as well and are in a similar situation. I make just over $70k and he makes closer to $375k when he starts his new job. We try too split things evenly when we can but be definitely steps up from time to time to cover the cost of cabs and meals (we live in a big city). I think it\u2019s very important to discuss money openly especially with an SO and it seems like you\u2019re on your way. You can also find a lot of information on this sort of stuff on the Refinery 29 \u201cMoney Diaries\u201d Facebook group.",
            "I commend you for this! You handled this so professionally even though it was probably pretty difficult / awkward to discuss being the one in the \u201cless lucrative\u201d position",
            "Congratulations! I was in the same boat with my girlfriend back in September. She kept bringing up that she didn\u2019t make as much and felt really guilty but we sat down and laid out all the bills and separated them so that we were paying about the same percentage of our paycheck (if wording it like that makes sense). She\u2019s hourly so when she does have overtime wages she will offer to throw some towards rent to help. \n\nStep up a plan so that you both are still able to save and have your own fun money. Good luck!",

            "Did the same.  He offered me 400 a month but I said 600. It's been working beautifully. He makes more but damn if I'm gonna be a kept lady.",
            "Warning.  No matter how lovey dovey you two are moving in with anyone is no joke.  These sorts of things can even break couples.  Just try to keep the communication open at all times and since you'll be living together make sure you give each other plenty of space.  Good luck, seriously.",
            "My wife makes more than double what I make.  This does not bother her at all, but as the lower earner, it\u2019s not as easy for me. After consulting with friends and the internet, here\u2019s how we decided to split expenses fairly (NOT equally)-  each of us pays the percentage equal to our percentage of the total household income for any large purchases/expenses (rent, furniture, etc) .  \n\nEx- for simplicity sake let\u2019s say your combined total income is $100,000 and your monthly rent + utilities totals $1,000. If partner \u201cA\u201d makes $65,000, that\u2019s 65% of the total income.   \u201cA\u201d would pay 65% of any expenses you decide to apply this formula to and \u201cB\u201d would pay 35%. In this case, \u201cA\u201d pays $650 for rent/utilities and \u201cB\u201d pays $350. \n\nMy wife and I use this formula for rent and used this when we bought a new couch and TV.  It takes the pressure off and allows me to contribute a fair portion to expenses.",
            "Let me just chime in real quick with how my boyfriend and I deal with it. \nHe makes significantly more money than I do, so we have a joint account that we each deposit half of our paychecks every week in to. And we pay all the bills and household expenses with that, leaving the other half in our personal accounts to be used on whatever else.\n That way it's proportionate to what we make and we don't touch the joint account other than for bills and such so it allows us to start saving as well.",
            "> But generally speaking we just treat doing chores as an opportunity to spend time together and be productive. :)\n\nYou guys are going to be very happy together. <3",
            "Honestly sounds similar to how i moved in with my now husband. Though i make more now. Things can always change. Happy i read this today, and good luck to you both!",
            "Congrats! Now go be happy and leave this terrible place.",
            "Agree with everyone else. Bills and rent should be based on percentage of income (each person puts in 30% for example). It's super unfair for one person to have to use a higher percentage of their income to pay for a shared living space in a committed relationship. Like... if I'm living with a guy, I'm testing the waters to see if he's marriage material, and if he's being cheap and forcing me to struggle more financially than him, then there won't be a future. It's especially annoying when the guy doesn't pull his weight when it comes to domestic responsibilities, which seems to be common.",
            "Partner and I had the same situation moving in together. Being open and honest and reassessing is so important. As the partner who makes more it feels good to acknowledge there is a gap but to also be fully confident that \u201cwe are deciding, together\u201d. Eventually we will get married and even more so our assets will be commingled so I stopped thinking about it as \u201cme subsidizing her rent\u201d and more like \u201cwe both pay what we can afford to main the lifestyle WE both want to share.\u201d\n\nI DO NOT recommend using chores as a way to alleviate the difference; I think it\u2019s only OK if someone works *significantly* more hours. I think relying on chores can lock in the shitty gender roles so much of society is trying to get away from; especially since my partner also has a busy full time job. \n\nWhen we have kids, I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be fair for me to say \u201cyou change the diapers cause I make more cause I studied X.\u201d",

Alaska can be really expensive so I said I would happily move in with him but I couldn\u2019t afford to pay more than I was currently paying for my room in the shared house.

            "Congrats! I love living with my boyfriend, but there was definitely a period of adjustment we both had to get through. You'll probably discover little habits that'll feel cute at first, and then get annoying later.

Only time it\u2019s been an issue was when I gave up work to raise our kids and I was the one with the issue. I really struggle with not contributing financially.",
            "Congrats. Sounds like a plan. Don't worry about the money. As long as both people are contributing to the best of their abilities - don't even think about it.  Y'all just enjoy and - don't worry about the money.",
            "My SO and I did the same thing! I make so much less than my boyfriend that if we did percentages of income I would be paying a stupid small amount, so instead we did a little under what the recommend amount per month is for someone who earns as much as I do, and he does the rest. I\u2019m still paying less than what I paid when we lived separately. We split bills like water and electricity and internet down the middle. Otherwise I pay for myself for most things, as does he (groceries in half unless he wants fancy things then he just does that, same with like alcohol, etc). \n\nFor things like furniture we have a just in case document where if our relationship ever ends we know who bought what or what we split on. Even though he can\u2019t really afford the place without me, our plan is that he will stay and I will leave without the need to contribute to rent if our relationship ends. I think it\u2019s good to talk about the scary stuff and have a plan for it. Hopefully it won\u2019t happen but if it does we\u2019ll be glad we won\u2019t have to figure out fairness and logistics in a really difficult and sad time. \n\nMy suggestion to you is to not feel guilty about contributing less. I did for a while to the point where I didn\u2019t express my concerns about not saving any money myself. We had a conversation a couple months ago where he realized that I had only a couple hundred in savings from my new job. He was really upset that he was able to save so much when I was living paycheck to paycheck. He didn\u2019t think it was fair and we adjusted.",

            "Hey! I\u2019m not sure if someone has suggested this already, but I\u2019ve heard some couples with greatly differing incomes split according to percentage of income.\n\nSo, say you make $30,000 post-tax and your partner makes $50,000 post-tax, and say your shared living expenses are $3,000 a month, then your portion could be $1125 and theirs could be $1875. ($30,000 divided by $80,000 combined income = 0.375 multiplied by $3000 combined expenses.) And if you work less hours than your partner, you could contribute in other ways to help bridge the gap.\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a way to scale this better, but I can\u2019t remember the math. Maybe something where half of total expenses are split 50/50, and the other half of total expenses are according to percentage of income. So, like...you each pay $750 to cover the first half of $3000, and the other half of the $3000 would go $562.50 extra for you and $937.50 extra for him. \n\nOh, and set up an account where you both throw money into every month to pay for common expenses, split according to whatever you decide. (Also I\u2019d recommend hiring a cleaner once a month out of that fund, if you\u2019re both into that idea. Keeps the peace.) \n\nGood luck!",

In the beginning, before you fully establish who does what chores, do not take on more than half because you feel guilty. What chores you start from the begging always tend to stick to you as \u201cyour chores\u201d \n\n\nEnjoy your house of love!!",
            "As for chores, that's how my partner and I did it for years!

So I knew with his roomates leaving, it would be just him and I taking over his lease and we would have to split everything 50/50. Rent plus utilities sucked up most of my income. Plus I have a car payment, so I had next to no money for anything else. Until he got a better job. He was bringing in significantly more than me and before I could even ask him if there could be a shift in our 50/50 split, he tells me he will take on a larger portion of the expenses. It was such a relief! Now that I finally got the promotion I've been after for a while, things couldn't be better. Keep up the good communication. Sounds like you two have a very bright future!",

I vowed that in my relationships, I would do my best to prevent that. \n\nI (28F) am currently in a situation where I make more than my partner and we're starting to have these kinds of discussions as more of our lives intertwine (planning travel, fun excursions).

            "Way to go!  Two thoughts: write up a cohabiting agreement that also covers chores, time spent together expectations, time spent with families, friends, as well as money.  Have a written agreement of how to lovingly deal with conflicts and hard feelings.  Review monthly and adjust as mutually agreed upon.  You don't have to go all Sheldon Cooper on this (Big Bang Theory), but the sooner you write down your separate and mutual visions of the logistics of living together, the stronger your relationship will become.  \n\nThe other is to warn you that putting things in storage is a slippery slope.  Most people (myself included) wake up three years later and realize they've spent $10,000 for items that were replaceable.  Maybe put \"review storage rental\" on your cohabiting agreement.",

            "Hey from another much older half sibling with a flighty dad! I am 36, and my sister is 15. When I told my husband that I thought my sister would need to move in with us for a bit, he took a day off, completely cleared out his office/studio so she would have a nice big bedroom, and bought her a cool vintage wardrobe since the room doesn't have a closet. He did all of this before I got home from work. There are people who will think of your sister as an intrusion into their idealized version of a life with you. And then there are people who will make as much space for her as she needs, and see your love and support of her as a strength. You need that second kind of person, and it's okay to hold off until you find her.",

Lots of women would take how much you care about your sister as a good sign.\n\nThe one concern I could see cropping up is that whomever you date might end up being the surrogate step parent to your surrogate father role, and not everyone is going to be comfortable with that.

Many people dont want to date someone with kids, and while your sister is not your child, you do spend a lot of time with her and some people may not want to sign up for that.

The guy set up a camera in the kitchen to see if his sister was doing her chores and it showed her putting away the groceries and the dishes. Later the girlfriend came in and took all the dishes and put them back into the dishwasher and took the groceries out of the cabinets and put them on the counter.

You can't blame her for not wanting that level of complication in her life, but she should also realize that this just isn't the right relationship for her.\n\nYou two need to have a serious talk.

Sure, your sister isn't technically your child, but she's spending so much time at your place that she has her own room and you're doing her laundry, so it's kind of like she's your kid. You aren't wrong for wanting to step in and be an important part of your sister's life. Your girlfriend isn't wrong for not wanting to date someone that is essentially playing the role of a single father (although she is wrong about how your relationship is \"weird\"). Not all women will feel the same way, but your current partner does, so you're incompatible. In the future, you should be very upfront while in the early stages of dating what your sister's involvement is in your life, so that they aren't surprised you are playing surrogate father.

            "I think your relationship is great with your sister, and so many people have provided talking points for you to address it with your gf.\n\nJust one sidenote I noticed though which I think you should take in mind, is that your sister is actually coming to an age where you should be teaching and letting her do her own laundry. It'd actually be good to start now, I'm a bit surprised she hasn't yet, but I think your family situation might lend to that. But in either case, teach her how to do her laundry herself, you can make it another bonding experience to teach her and you'll be helping her become more self sufficient (and you know, giving her more privacy during puberty and all that jazz).",
            "You said you love her and want to work it out.  So ignore all the \u201cfuck you, I don\u2019t care how you feel only my sister matters\u201d advice.  After you try reasoning with her, saying it more like \u201cShe\u2019s going to continue to be a priority in my life, and if you want me to share my life with you, as I do, it means....\u201d. \n\nBut don\u2019t start with that.  You need to explain to her that you aren\u2019t just her big brother, you\u2019re her surrogate father because she doesn\u2019t have one.  And she\u2019s like a daughter to you, and a huge source of joy in your life. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a canned response.  The details matter, and you can absolutely make some accommodations.  Your GF wants to fuck your brains out and walk around naked and doesn\u2019t want the responsibilities of a kid yet.  If she can have some accommodations and you can both talk about it (starting with you), that\u2019ll help.  Try to give your girlfriend some boundaries while also not neglecting your sister.  \n\nAnd for the love of god, you need to open up about your vulnerability and how it would kill you to leave your 10 year old sister in the same situation as you were in.  And go from there. \n\nAfter all that, then it\u2019s \u201cShe\u2019s going to continue to be a priority in my life, and if you want to share my life with you, as I do, it means....\u201d.\n\nGood luck friend.\n\nEdit:  \nAnd also, her being concerned that you might be inappropriate with a 10 year old isn\u2019t a huge red flag.  It means she wants to protect your sister who is clearly vulnerable.  She doesn\u2019t have the tools to do it, but her intent was good.  Boundaries are important for girls entering puberty, and she might be protective for a reason. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have the tools either, go get relationship counseling.  They\u2019ll teach you communication tools.",
            "you know the right thing to do here\n\nOne simple conversation with your GF that your sister is your sister, and needs protected and some stability - and that you as her stable older brother are the one to provide that...and that if she (the GF) can't see that - then it's just not going to work...and there is the door. \n\nCould be over and done with in 2 minutes and you'll be out having ice cream with your sister within 10.",
            "I would honestly cut my losses. It's not that she is just jealous of the relationship, but she's sexualising it when she says it's inappropriate. It's one thing to feel left out because you do things with your sister, but when she calls it inappropriate through a sexual context, then there is no reasoning with her.",
            "You're an awesome brother, and if I met a guy like that I would like him MORE for it, and do everything I could to support that relationship. \n\nIn a few years you won't remember her face, but your sister will remember that bedroom and your care of her for the rest of her life.",
            "Honestly it sounds like your gf doesn't want to be a partial parent and/or always make plans with that revolve around your little sister. She isn't wrong for not wanting that lifestyle but she shouldn't shame you for choosing to take in that big responsibility. You aren't dumping your sister on your GF so either she accepts and learns and starts to love your sister or it isn't going to work; your gf will be creating a hostile environment for your sister.",
            "I have 27D, 26S, 25S, and a 14 yr old daughter. My older 3 kids dote on their little sister a lot, and have her over quite often, especially my youngest son as he has a 4 yr old daughter who adores her young aunt, and vice versa. After he split from his wife, he got his own place with an extra room and bunk beds for his daughter and sister. He met his gf about a yr and a half ago now, and she was a bit weirded out because she assumed his younger sister was just the babysitter and wondered why the heck she had her own bed (she didn't ask right away as they had just started dating). He was so used to everyone knowing who his sister was already, so his dumb butt didn't explain. Once he did explain, it changed how his gf felt about him dramatically - FOR THE BETTER. Knowing how dedicated he was to both his daughter and his little sister made her realize that he was not just a fun guy, but a good man who put his family and loved ones first in everything, no matter what!  \n\nTHAT is how your idiotic girlfriend should feel about you and the very close relationship you have with your sister! Even more so, because you have raised her whereas my daughter still has both parents and her 3 older siblings!! I would seriously question the longevity of the relationship after her response. How can you want to be with someone like that hun? If explaining that you basically raised your sister and how losing your own mom made you feel didn't get through her thick skull, I don't think anything else will either.",
            "She knew y'all were a package deal, right? She's not the one for you if she can't accept reality",
            "OP, you should probably have a serious talk with her. I dont agree with everyone saying to dump her. She's obviously insecure and if everyone dumped people who were insecure about something, I think everyone would be single. Maybe shes just uncomfortable around a relationship like that bc shes never experienced one like yours. Or something else could have happened to her that makes her feel that way. Literally just talk to her. There has to be a reason shes doing this.",
            "Your gf probs wanted a normal relationship w you. No responsibility, hot sex whenever wherever in the apartment etc and is probably angry that isn\u2019t a possibility and is hurt you\u2019re kind of already in a parent role and it affects the youthful relationship that she fantasises about with you. \nI imagine that\u2019s why she acts this way and is lashing out. She doesn\u2019t hate your sister. Just what your sister being around took away from her. \n\n\nRegardless, she isn\u2019t the right fit for you and your situation so imo (and the opinion of seemingly everyone in the thread) you\u2019ve gotta end it.",
            "I find it so cringe that your gf is basically sexualizing your sister. She lost it over a pair of children\u2019s underwear? That\u2019s just weird. Your sister is a child, and a member of your family. I think it\u2019s great that you two have a good relationship and that you care a lot about her.  As for your gf, she needs to either accept this, or she needs to leave. She sounds toxic anyways for trying to make you choose her over your sister.",
            "your Gf doesn't want to be a mother to a 10 year old. That's understandable. You're gonna have to choose. And if you choose your GF you lose cause you gonna end up resenting her anyway. Kiss this one goodbye. \n\nBe open with potential future partners. A lot of people don't want to be stepparents so I'm not sure how it got this far, but if you say \"no I don't have kids\" then a few month down the line oh yeah I pretty much raise my sister, that IS having a kid!  So be honest.",
            "Your priorities are in the right place, OP.",
            "You got your priorities right. Your girlfriend is an asshole implying your relationship is weird.",
            "I think you're making the right decision in the \"soon-to-be ex\". She clearly does not see family as a priority, while you do. You recognize that your little sister NEEDS you in her life and there is nothing inappropriate about that. Maybe she's jealous of the time and attention you give her, but it's really your GF's opinions that are inappropriate. Your little sister needs you. Dump this chick and find someone who also feels family is important and also wants to be there for your little sister.\n\nI would just tell her that family is extremely important to you and that you are extremely offended by her twisting your relationship with your sister into something inappropriate. You feel this difference in valuing family is a deal breaker for you, that you need someone who values family as much as you do and someone who will be supportive of you helping to raise your little sister, and obviously she is not into that role so it's time to go your separate ways.",

            "I really liked seeing this post. I'm sorry for the situation you've been brought up in, and I'm so thankful for how you have handled it. Good on you for being there for your sister, and keep doing that. I always longed for a big brother like you when I was a kid, I'm sure she adores you. :)",
            "Wow. I thought the issue was going to be that your girlfriend hadn't decided if she wanted to have/raise children yet, and was uncomfortable dating what amounts to 'a dad.' \n\nUnfortunately, if she decides she wants to shout her weird, jealous opinions from the rooftops, there's not much you can do about it. Just tell anyone who asks the truth and hope she moves on to some other drama, I guess.",
            "She obviously thinks there is a sexual component to all of this and since there isn't, that is more her problem than yours.",
            "I don't think it's weird your gf doesn't want to take in a 10 year old child she didn't sign up for. She is only 25 and might not be ready for that kind of responsibility/not want kids. But then she shouldn't have a relationship with you. You're basically a single divorced dad at this point, and for some that is a deal-breaker. Just be upfront with her, break it of if it comes to that. And be upfront to future girlfriends that she (your sister) is going to be there, take it or leave it.\n\nEdit: I want to add that  I missed the  implications she  made. Thats  fucked up.",

You're her caregiver when she's there, so it only makes sense that you'd do her laundry. \n\nDon't give in to your girlfriend's jealousy. It's also a serious, major red flag. She's free to move on, you basically are a single dad. Not everyone is okay with that, and that's totally cool.

It would probably be easier if your sister was your daughter, because if she doesn\u2019t like to have kids around much then she might not have made the decision to commit to you without all the facts.\n\nI\u2019m not blaming you but at the same time, she probably didn\u2019t realise how parent-y your role was. Now you\u2019re 6 months in and the resentment has built, but so has attachment. But to be honest I can understand why she\u2019s freaking out. She didn\u2019t get into the relationship thinking you had a daughter. \n\nIt\u2019s not easy coming into the father-child dynamic with all the information, let alone not really understanding your unconventional relationship.\n\nIt\u2019s also hard to talk about your frustrations with the \u201cdad\u201d when he\u2019s super defensive and won\u2019t hear a bad word being said about the child or the relationship with the child. It\u2019s intimidating. \n\nIf it\u2019s too much, and your sister is bearing any of the brunt of your gf\u2019s frustrations - of course leave.

Mentally, financially and mature. \n6 years ago her mom decided that divorce was the right path for her. We (my ex) remained close friends but the damage to our daughter was inevitable. Her brother stepped in and helped her through the pain and confusion. They txt every day and she is close to his daughter. It\u2019s heartwarming to see all of the connections. \nNo relationship is worth getting in the way of siblings being close.

My husband adores my brothers and sometimes it feels like they love him more than me and I couldn\u2019t be happier about it. When we got engaged he sat me down and told me that if anything should ever happen to my parents he\u2019d like for us to adopt them. All of our plans include the 3 of them. Our apartment is a two bedroom so they can have their space when they come visit, the homes we\u2019re looking at are 4-5 bedrooms so they have their own space and always feel welcome.

You'll end up spending less time with her to avoid fights and your lady will give her dirty looks and make rude comments.

That would be the healthy thing to do rather than projecting your own insecurities onto a 10 year old.",
            "Six months isn't that long. While you may like this girlfriend, there is someone out there who WILL love how much you care about family and that person will want to become part of it; instead of trying to separate you from your 10 year old sister.\n\nSecond, your sister is TEN years old? That's a child. If a woman (your girlfriend) feels envious or like they have to compete then she has more issues than she's admitting. I'm not trying to be rude, but you sound like a family type of guy and your gf doesn't. A good partner will make whatever is important to you also important to her.",
            "You are an amazing man that stood up and took over that role of dad/brother. Your girlfriend should feel proud that you love your sister that much and you want to take on the role that your dad has skipped out on.

            "Sounds like she's in an imaginary competition where she's the only one playing. If she thinks your relationship with your sister is a threat, she needs to get out. I can only imagine the passive remarks she can potentially make if you decide to stay with her and your sister grows older. \n\nYou can talk to her about it and establish that both she and your sister are important. Each have their own place in your life and that your relationship wont change. I can understand if sister is on every date you go to, cancelling on your gf to spend more time with sister etc, basically where gf cant spend time without sister there. But that doesnt sound like it (from what you described) It just sounds like she's jealous and petty. \n\nSo you gotta decide of it's something you wanna have multiple conversations about to understand insecurities there and reassure your relationship. Or if it is a deal breaker when your partner tells you to distant yourself from your sister.\n\nEdit: also if your partner doesnt wanna play any aunt/potential mom figure role too.

        "selftext": "I (30f) have been married to my husband (45m) for 5 years and together for 8. Obviously we have an age gap in our relationship and whenever we discussed possible health issues or medical care, it was regarding him. \n\nAbout four months ago, I was in a car accident. I was talking on Bluetooth to my husband because I was nervous driving on the icy roads going to our house, when another car rounded a corner too fast and lost control. It was one of those \u201cexact wrong moment\u201d things and my car went off the road and into a tree. My husband heard the whole thing and my last memory before I lost consciousness was him screaming my name. \n\nI don\u2019t want to get into the bloody details, but I ended up being in the hospital for over a month. I needed multiple surgeries and have been in physical therapy ever since. I am finally getting to a point where I feel like myself again and am no longer in pain. I\u2019ve gained back some weight and look good if I do say so myself. \n\nMy husband literally worked out of my hospital room for the entire time I was there. He went home to shower, sleep and look after the dogs, then came right back. He attended all my therapy appointments so he would know how to better help me recover at home. He was amazing and everything I could ask him to be in that kind of horrible situation. I love him so much and so yesterday while shopping, I saw this gorgeous black lingerie set and decided to surprise him. We haven\u2019t had sex since before the accident and every time I try, it feels like he makes an excuse or expresses some concern about some random body part of mine that is no longer injured. \n\nHe was on his laptop in bed when I came in wearing my new purchases and I could tell he was taken by surprise. I basically crawled into his lap and started kissing his neck and grinding on him. He was definitely hard but then he lost it and pushed me away, saying that we shouldn\u2019t rush this and he doesn\u2019t want to jeopardize my recovery with sex. I was crying by the time he ended the sentence and said \u201cI\u2019m fine! The doctors say sex is fine!\u201d But he was already walking into the bathroom and turning on the shower. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to think. Is it the scars? Is the memory of me in a hospital bed unable to even sit up by myself repelling him? I finally am starting to feel good about myself and my body again and the fact that he won\u2019t touch me is really hurting my mental health. It\u2019s probably a long shot but has anyone else experienced this?\n\nTL;DR: I was in a major car accident and I\u2019m finally back to myself but my husband doesn\u2019t want to have sex with me.\n\nUpdate: \n\nThank you again for everyone\u2019s kind and thoughtful comments, I read all of them even if I didn\u2019t respond. Last night when we got in bed I curled up next to my husband and held him while I said basically \u201cwe\u2019ve been through a lot, would you be willing to get therapy with me to make sure everything is alright for both of us? I love you so much and I don\u2019t want any underlying trauma to effect our relationship.\u201d\n\nHe was silent for about ten second and then the floodgates opened. I\u2019ve only seen him cry once or twice in our entire relationship (at our wedding and the first time I told him I loved him), but I held him while he sobbed for what was probably an hour. He kept apologizing for it and I had to keep saying \u201cdon\u2019t be sorry, I\u2019m here, cry if you need to cry.\u201d And I shed some tears of my own. \n\nIt was an exhausting but ultimately extremely cathartic experience. When it was all over and he was able to say more than a few words, he told me that there was about 15 minutes when he was sure he had just heard the love of his life die, then we got to the hospital and the doctors made it clear they would do everything they could but the extent of my injuries were extreme and severe. Then he spent hours calling family members, waiting, pacing and trying to grapple with the fact that I might die and he might be alone. Then I spent five days in the ICU, mostly unconscious. He said he\u2019s never known fear like that in his life. \n\nIn the end we agreed to go to individual and couple\u2019s therapy and even touched on the sex thing, wherein he admitted that he knows objectively nothing bad will happen to me if we have sex but for some reason it is sparking this protective instinct that makes him want to treat me like glass. \n\nSo we\u2019re working on it, and our marriage is amazing. He\u2019s the love of my life and we can get through this.",

            "Your husband literally worked out of your hospital room and only went home to shower and keep the dogs alive. Your husband loves you and this is crystal clear. Like someone else has said, I don't think it's him feeling unattracted to you, or scars, etc. I think he is seeing your body now as a very fragile thing that he almost lost. He could very well possibly be traumatized from hearing the car accident in the phone call and seeing you in a hospital bed for weeks. I don't often suggest couples therapy, but I think it would behove him to help work this out with you in a setting like that. You're very precious to him and while it isn't rational thinking, he could be terrified of damaging you in some way.",
            "So...I'm not a mind reader, but his reaction makes a lot of sense to me when I think about the last 4 months from his perspective.  \n\nHe heard you scream, and then *nothing* from you.  Presumably he heard the crushing metal of the crash.  For him...there was a period of time when he did not know if you were dead.  Maybe he had to direct first responders to try to find you, and had to learn whether you were alive from them.  The fact that you were in the hospital for *more than a month* says to me that he was almost certainly told you might die even once he learned you were alive.  The fact that he lived in your hospital room was probably as much for him as for you--because if he wasn't there, and something happened, you might die and he wouldn't be able to stop it.  It's very possible he spent that entire month in crushing fear, trying to consciously or subconsciously *guard you* from death.  He almost certainly spent at least several days in that state.\n\nI'm assuming that the focus since then has been mostly on getting you physically okay.  It's only been four months, and he's probably spent them all in caretaker mode.  The thing about caretaker mode is that you push your own issues to the back.  You don't focus on any healing you might need to do.  (Note that I'm not justifying that, necessarily.  Sometimes people go into caretaker mode or stay in it not because somebody actually needs care, but because our own fear is too scary to face and that mode keeps us from \"having\" to deal with it in the short term). For him...the trauma of being unsure if he would still have you tomorrow is still almost certainly unhealed.\n\nAs for why he responded that way...people tend to store emotional pain they're not addressing yet in the body.  Tight muscles, strained postures, clenching...people grind their teeth and bunch of their fists under stress for a reason, and we do similar things to the rest of our body.  That kind of trauma can feel like a physical spring, stored under tension.  When you went to initiate intimacy and started *touching* his body in a way that normally creates a strong reaction, you added those feelings on top of the stored feelings, but pulling in a different direction...and the spring destabilized and went off.  You basically accidentally took the lid off a pressure cooker before it had a chance to vent.  I think that's why his response was centered around fear for your safety, even though you're feeling much better and not worried yourself.  All that trapped fear just kinda blew up in both your faces.\n\nIf that's what happened, it's not necessarily anything in your relationship that needs to heal...it's just that he needs to step back now and take the time to face that shit down.  I'd strongly recommend therapy to help him process.  I also, on a personal level, find that crying tends to let some of that tension back out.  I tend to use a Pixar movie to get the tears going--it sounds a little silly, but it helps some.",
            "I don't think he doesn't find you attractive anymore. I don't think it's the scars. I think he's just shook to the core by the whole thing and scared of hurting you. \n\nTalk to him about it. Tell him you'd understand if the trauma of the accident makes it hard for him to get in the mood.\n\nI'd just give him a bit of time to recenter. Tell him it might help him to talk to a therapist.",
            "Thank you everyone for your kind comments. I think I realized that just because I physically feel better, it doesn\u2019t mean our lives can magically go back to normal. Which was basically what I was trying to do. \n\nWe both went thorough a major trauma and pretending it didn\u2019t happen will only be damaging to both of us. I can\u2019t say how much I love this man, he is my whole world and the thought that he has been hurting but trying to protect me from it by staying silent makes me feel sick. \n\nThe bottom line is we both need to go to therapy to unpack everything that happened and develop some healthy coping mechanisms. \n\nAnother part of this was we were trying for a baby before the accident and I was excited to get back to it.\n\nMuch love to everyone who commented",
            "I like all the counseling suggestions and agree it\u2019s warranted. You\u2019ve both been so much! But in the meantime, please don\u2019t take his refusal as the rejection it must have felt like. He\u2019s dealing with how he almost lost you when that age gap had previously protected him from having to do that. Mortality and reality and everything he probably thought was sorted out came unraveled. \n\nYou both sound like lovely people and I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re doing so well.",
            "The only person who can tell you with any certainty what is going on in his mind is: him.\n\nCounseling or therapy, either for him as an individual, or for you as a couple (or preferably both) is the necessary next step here.\n\nYou *both* have been through a trauma.  His was purely mental and emotional, whereas yours was physical as well.  But traumas change the way people look at the world, look at their lives...even how they look at their *partners*.\n\nHe at the very least needs counseling or therapy to help him process what he has been through, and *because* what he has been through is affecting the connection that the two of you have, you need counseling or therapy as a couple to learn the new landscape of communication that exists between you now.\n\nAnd none of what I am saying is meant to minimize what *you* have been going through; you've been through just as much as or more than he has, but you are (clearly) dealing with it in a different way.  It's possible that individual therapy or counseling would be of benefit to you as well, but that's less likely to address the specific situation you are asking about in your post.",
            "This is a multi faceted problem.\n\nYou know your physical state and are ready to go. He doesn't.\n\nHe heard the women he loves have a horrific accident. The whole thing played out like a nightmare. The last thing you heard was him screaming your name, but you have no idea what he heard after you were unconscious.\n\nHe heard that and could do nothing\n\nHe saw you broken in the hospital and could do nothing.\n\nHe saw you in pain going through physical therapy and could do nothing.\n\nHe was in crisis mode living with you in the hospital and could do nothing.\n\nYou get where his head is at? So to have you come in the bedroom in lingerie raring to go is a bit of a leap. He has to wrap his head around that. I will guarantee you he is still in crisis mode. You couldn't drive a straight pin up his ass with a five pound hammer.\n\nThis is not meant in any way to assign any blame on you. Like I said, you know how you feel and he doesn't. So you're going to have to employ that communication thing and gently express how you feel and what you want. And a little outside assistance from a good therapist certainly couldn't hurt.",
            "First of all, I'm so sorry you went through that. Second of all, when you end up as a caretaker, sometimes your sexual desire dwindles because you do this thing where your brain shuts off its own wants or desires and hyperfocuses on the other person because it's easier to control than dealing with your own emotional state. \n\nFor your husband, to accept that you're fine means he needs to address his own emotional state, which after a major event like that is likely something he's put on hold while you recovered. You have a very good husband, but it sounds like he's fallen into the trap that many of us who have become care takers have which is to neglect onesself. Which means he still has to process through everything that happened. So while you may have healed, he paused himself so that you could take up the bandwidth of the relationship. He did the right thing, but now that you're improving he needs to be shown that he can be vulnerable. \n\nI would start with just intimacy. He's probably been in crisis mode for a long time so that means his adrenal receptors are all worn out. Focus on contact that doesn't involve sex, but builds intimacy like holding eachother on the couch while watching a movie, etc. Sometimes couples don't recover from disasters because they don't do the \"aftercare\" necessary to really deal with the trauma that happens to both partners. While yes, of course, you went through the worst of it... he also almost lost you which likely shook him to his core. And it's something that needs to be addressed. \n\nI would also recommend therapy to help you both develop the communication skills to talk about what happened and how to process through it.",
            "[deleted]",
            "I bet that he is dealing with a bit of PTSD, dealing with the news that a loved one has been in a life-threatening accident is terrifying, but he had to helplessly listen in on the accident as it happened. I bet he hasn\u2019t processed this completely and it could definitely be interrupting his ability to be sexually intimate.",
            "I also lost my wife during the birth of our child.  I was scared to death to even breathe on her for six months.  I would lay awake all night and just listen to her breathe.  I believe that it effected me more then did her.  I still cry when I think about that night more then 19 years ago.",
            "The two of you need to get to trauma counseling immediately.\n\nIt took my husband months to feel okay with sex after I almost died. He was also severely traumatized by what happened and he was afraid to try anything because of it.",
            "37 year old dating a 22 year old...",
            "The time for just trying to start having sex is over, you need to sit down and have a conversation with him--what is going on in his head? If he's been with you at these appointments, I assume he's heard the doctors say sex is fine? Why doesn't he believe that after hearing a doctor say it? Tell him you are feeling so much better and are so excited about having your body back and that you want to have sex and have that part of your relationship back and see what he says. I think it's very unlikely that something about your body post-accident is actually turning him off.  \n\n\nUltimately I agree with the others that the most likely explanation is that this has been super traumatic for him as well and you guys will need to go to therapy, but you might as well talk to him about it first.",
            "Does the hospital have a support group?\n\nHaving helped family through long recoveries, there are many normal issues he could be dealing with.  Does he have a therapIst?  He is also recovering from trauma as the spouse of a survivor.",
            "This is not a surprising reaction for your husband. This accident I'm sure was quite traumatizing for BOTH of you. Your husband has (rightfully) put forth so much time and energy towards your healing, and likely has had no time or guidance to process the accident or any of HIS feelings about it. \n\nYour husband would benefit massively from counseling. Virtually everyone who undergoes a traumatic event (even if the actual event doesn't occur TO them, just witnessing it is enough) would benefit from therapy/counseling. Unfortunately, far too many people can't or won't access it. \n\nCouples counseling could absolutely be super beneficial too, but if one needs to be prioritized (due to expense, logistics, availability, etc.), I'd go for your husband getting individual therapy too. \n\nIf your husband is uncomfortable with \"regular\" talk therapy, or generally against it or whatever, perhaps he would be more open to something like EMDR, which is known to be particularly helpful for PTSD, or a specific trauma. It doesn't involve talking through an event (I mean usually the practitioner would need to have some idea of what the event was, but usually not too much in details). Another option that can be effective, although I think its less \"official\" than EMDR or talk therapy, is breathwork. Breathwork for trauma therapy usually has to do with the idea that when a person experiences a traumatic event, the body holds some stress and may not let it go. Then the stress essentially continues to \"live\" in the body until it is released in some way. But again, it doesn't involve much of any talking about the experience. \n\nIf your husband was open to all options, my unprofessional opinion would be EMDR for him, and couples counseling for the two of you.\n\nBest of luck to both you and your husband on your healing journey. Remember that healing takes a long time and is not linear, so you both need patience and grace for yourselves and each other.",
            "The poor guy is definitely traumatized. In those last few moments on the phone, he thought that he was hearing you die. That would mess up anyone. He probably has PTSD from this. You should both attend therapy *together*. \n\nHe's probably also terrified at the thought of potentially injuring you during sex somehow.",
            "When your husband goes through almost loosing you, it does things mentally to them that we do not understand. I had a hysterectomy go wrong in 2012. The last thing I said to my family before my lifesaving surgery was things like \u201cdo you know our bank info, do you know where the life insurance is\u201d things like that right before I passed out. My husband walked the hospital grounds millions of times the month I was in the hospital. He learned how to unhook my g-tube to help me go to the bathroom. He held my hand night I was on to much pain meds I was hallucinating. All of these things and the horror they caused him, he held in as to not upset me. He watched the love of his life almost die and it messed him up for a long time. We made it through it and you will too. Get you guys some therapy and talk to each other. It\u2019s a very hard thing to process.",
            "Might i suggest therapy. I suspect he may have PTSD and using ur injuries is just an excuse. Sounds like u guys have a great relationship otherwise. Im so glad how well you are doing now.",
            "I suspect that he's scared of hurting you. It's hard when you see someone you love broken. Your instinct is to make thier life's easier. He probably needs counciling himself.",
            "it seems like you keep trying to initiate sex and he keeps turning you down - directly or indirectly. have you tried just talking to him? not when you initiate or want to initiate sex. not while anything else is going on. just sitting, preferably out of bed, and talking. start out by saying you want to discuss the physical part of your relationship. don't tell him how he feels (\"it seems like you don't want to have sex with me\"). be open about your own feelings (\"i would like to be physical with you again\"). give him space to talk to you about his reservations.\n\nas others suggest, this might take a counselor, but you need to start talking",
            "Talk to him about it don\u2019t try to guess how he is feeling or thinking at one point he said he wasn\u2019t ready ask him about this you both need to heal from this and only open communication will bring you both to an understanding about what you think and feel, have you ever gotten into a conversation and discovered how you feel or what you think when before you where perplexed? Just keep communicating and things will sort themselves out",

You both are extremely lucky to have each other, and it\u2019s a real gift that you are able to communicate this well. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nPlease be patient with yourselves and each other as you work through things. Even when you can perfectly describe the feelings, where they\u2019re coming from, and how you wish you\u2019d feel instead, the emotional experience can often take a lot longer to heal/change. Compassion is key, and that starts with both of you being compassionate with yourselves. Look op R.A.I.N. \u2013 recognize, accept, investigate, nurture \u2013 for a great model to process feelings like the ones your husband is experiencing.",
            "I was really touched by the story of how your husband cared for you during your recovery. Clearly you have a very loving relationship.\n\nWhat strikes me most about the events you described is that you waited until you were ready for sex again and then SURPRISED your husband with this information.  That doesn't seem quite fair, does it?  Maybe examine your expectations on male sexuality: do you expect a man to be ready -- physically and/or emotionally -- for sex at all times?  For many if not most men, that is not the case.  \n\nI suggest going to your husband, expressing gratitude that he was so understanding during your recuperation, saying that you're really looking forward to bringing sex back into your relationship, and asking him how and when he'd like to do it.  Is there an especially good time or way?\n\nThen just please be a little patient with him on this.  My guess is that the amount of time he will need to acclimate will be hours or days, not weeks or months.  If it takes much longer than that, couples therapy is something to consider.\n\nGood luck, and congratulations again on your strong relationship.",
            "You guys absolutely need couple's counseling because I couldn't imagine going back to \"normal\" after helplessly listening to your loved one endure a fatal car crash. Just the thought of it alone makes me want to tear up. You might be done with physical therapy but there's clearly a need for emotional therapy.",
            "You\u2019ve gotten really good advice (for the most part) so far. I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with your appearance, or that he doesn\u2019t find you attractive or that he\u2019s \u201ctaken on the carer role and can\u2019t see you romantically\u201d or whatever. He clearly loves you or he wouldn\u2019t have been so present during your recovery and he wouldn\u2019t be clingy now. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s easy to forget the emotional recovery is just as important as physical recovery. If someone breaks a shoulder, you don\u2019t just put it in a cast and then cut it off in a few months and expect to be back exactly where you were before it was broken. The same concept applies to emotional and mental recovery. You guys went through a trauma; it\u2019s both physical and mental. \n\nAnother way to think about it could be this: it sounds like you are grateful that he was there for you and helped you through the physical recovery from the accident. Maybe this could be your way of expressing that, by helping him through the emotional recovery.",
            "No I\u2019m not crying at 7am, you are!",

            "So I injured myself badly a while back.

He's probably just got it in his head you're wounded and need to be cared after and can't separate that from the reality that you're doing better now. A very direct conversation needs to be had about this and if he starts to make excuses then maybe something further like couples counseling.

I know the accident was hard for you but I\u2019m sure it was hard on him in an emotional way that takes some time.

It really hurt and it caused me to think he did not love me anymore. We ended up in couple therapy and it all came out, he could not turn off the switch of caregiver to spouse and he said all he could think of when he looked at me was me almost dying and it made him sick to his stomach because it scared him, he did not know how he was going to live without me and raise our son. He was so scared that If he touched me something bad would happen. Then he broke down and cried, he was holding much inside and I only saw my sickness and pain. We have worked on our issues and our marriage is stronger but it took time and a lot of healing and talking to each other. You have to work in the emotional before you can go on to the physical",

But as others have said he probably was traumatized by listening to the accident then being helpless as you took on your recovery. \n\nTry not to be hurt, it\u2019s obviously the last thing he wants to do is hurt you.",
            "With how attentive he was when you were in the hospital I don't think you need to worry about him losing interest. I think he's probably still mentally recovering helping you through it.

I reckon it\u2019s best you just sit down and try talk with him",
            "Now that you've gone through therapy, I feel like it's his turn. \n\nHe heard that terrible accident and he's probably hesitant over triggering something for you and himself. It's nothing against you, but he probably has some internalized guilt over the accident itself. \n\nMaybe he feels like he could've prevented it, and maybe this is his way of avoidance because he doesn't want to think about it while unintentionally hurting you emotionally in the process.",
            "He had wood but lost it, likely because his lust was weaker than his concern. He started thinking too much. It sounds like he's attracted but scared. I see that as a sign of love. You might need to have a long talk and give him time to process it before trying again, but you should try again.",
            "Try talking it out with him and see where his head is ( if you haven\u2019t already). Sit down and be open and accept his concerns & address then piece by piece. He may be worried about re-injury. You may have to start slow and build up his level of comfort because if he is worried about hurting you, it would crush him if he did. The things slow, talk it out. Also talk about his emotions and how he\u2019s feeling post accident because yes you can very well have trauma from the accident but he may as well. Hopefully ask works out. Sounds like he loves you deeply and is considerate of your well being & may not be able to determine if you\u2019re actually ready for intimacy or just in the mood.",

If you have any doubt,  throw it out, and rest assured. \n\nWhy he's acting the way he is, I honestly have no clue. Could be the fear of hurting you. It could be some other innermost mind games. \n\nBut I think the most important thing is  for you openly talk to him. For sure, something not right. But your mind is wandering to worrisome thoughts. You never address if you \"talked\" to him you said you argued. Sorry.\n\nYou could go to theory,  and I'm sure something will be gained.\n\nBy the most important thing is that you talk. And he may not be ready for it, you obviously are. B\n\nWhen you talk to him, please Don't use \"you\" statement's,  try always to deflect back on to yourself , the way your feeling. That will eventually him to open up about his feeling.\n\nBe careful, he's going to be super vulnerable at this point. It won't take much to shut him down.\n\nTheir is no doubt about the love in your relationship. That isn't the problem,  you both suffered trauma. Your's physical,  maybe his mental?\nGive him a kiss, tell you love him, and find a time SOON, when your both relaxed,  and start the conversation.

            "First off, it is wonderful that you are doing so much better. That had to be terrible. To go from a month long stay to doing pretty good in such a relatively short time is so great to hear. I work in a hospital, I see the difficulty in that.\n\nLike others mentioned, he definitely needs someone like a counselor to talk through things with, and a couples counselor would also help you guys communicate some more about this. \n\nHe clearly has trauma. Probably both from the accident and fear of losing you, and likely also some caregiver trauma. Especially considering it was so unexpected considering it was you and at your age.\n\nI seriously doubt he finds the scars or your body offputting. If anything, seeing scars or such might just be hard as a reminder of what happened. While I'm sure the struggle you've had getting better has made it seem like such a long time, it's been such a short amount of time in truth. It hasn't even been half a year. It takes time to process, and he likely hasn't done so while in caregiver mode, as he was focused on other things.\n\nAlso, going from caregiver mode and switching to partner/lover mode is difficult. Caregiver mode is often so removed from sexual feelings, although it can be just as intimate in a different way especially with a SO. Switching back can be hard to do. Heck, even parents can find it difficult to flip back to partner mode after being in parent mode all day, let alone caring for your partner themselves. It can also be hard to let go of. There's a feeling of control over the situation when caring for someone and letting that go means you have to deal with your own issues again.\n\nHe obviously cares so much for you. Women are disportionately left when in life-threatening health scares, but he showed how honorable he is and how much he can step up. Now he needs to focus a bit on some self-care. And that involves dealing with his feelings.\n\nYou need to sit down with him, in a very non-sexual situation, and communicate. Bring up your feelings. Listen when he talks. Don't just get defensive about feeling better. Really listen to his worries. Suggest/insist on counseling if you guys need. Remember, this has been a short time compared to all the time you've been together and compared to all the time you'll hopefully have together. There's no need to rush this, for either of you. Work this out as a team.",

You may be physically able but tell me do you ever get nervous driving? Feel fear? He might still live those fears. If I were him I\u2019d be afraid to hurt you regardless of what your doctor says so. He literally saw you go through so much.  If you get pregnant and your not healed enough?

You have made this entire thing about yourself. Yeah, you're fine. But is he? In all that text, I haven't read one thing about you doing a single thing for him, not even asking him if he's okay. He was going through his own personal hell of being so worried sick for you and sacrificing all his needs and feelings for you but because you bought some lingerie, you think that is going to automatically make him just forget every single traumatic emotion he had and have sex with you like nothing bad happened?\n\nThe fact you're so confused about why he could be feeling the way he feels tells me you probably think of him more as a provider than a human being.

I was 19 and she had to bathe me again...go with me for MRIs, all of the PT, learning to walk again....if a Medivac would fly over anywhere we were, she would go start hysterically crying. \n\nShe talks about driving me home from the hospital after 9 days, \"You had Pearl Jam as loud as it would go, that neck brace on, head stapled together, pumping your fist, singing \"hey, I ohhhhhh, I'm still alive \" Everybody passed us, staring at you. I didn't care, I was just glad you were still alive.\"\n\nIt's a lot harder on them than it is on us. I don't remember any of it. And I don't remember how long it took for my mom to see me as her adult daughter again, but we got back there. He's probably in a weird place.",
            "He needs therapy. You said he was talking to you as the accident happened - there\u2019s a very good chance he\u2019s perseverating on the thought of \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t talking to her she\u2019d never have been hurt\u201d.\n\nAlso you both need couples therapy - there\u2019s a lot of complex emotions being processed that have probably never been felt with both of you. You guys need a therapist to navigate those emotions *together* in a healthy way. Human psychology is, a lot of times, your brain finding the quickest route to a solution that involves the least effort and least discomfort. Without guidance it would be extremely easy to develop maladaptive coping mechanisms that aren\u2019t healthy to the relationship.",
            "I had this happen. I voluntarily went into a mental hospital and there were some treatment issues and I wanted to leave because they were making it worse. This indicated to the hospital that I should be there and they made me involuntary and moved me to the area they keep criminals and such. Shitty hospital.\n\nAnyway, I went in because I had drug induced mania. So on my way out, my depression and anxiety were horrific. I couldn\u2019t let him out of my sight because my brain though he would die if he was.\n\nDuring this time I was pretty much emotionally helpless and he took care of me.\n\nAfter it was all over and I was on correct meds, sex felt weird. We avoided it for a long while. We both agreed that it was probably because he was put in a care taker role and I was completely dependent. Like he\u2019s a care giver, not a lover.\n\nAnyway, I highly suggest talking about it openly. It really is the only way to get to the root of the problem.",
            "If your husband is terrified of injuring you at the moment, you could ease into intimacy. Maybe avoid p/v penetrative intercourse right now. Oral or giving each other \"hand\" attention could be the ice breaker. You both experience intimacy and \"relief\", and can cuddle afterward. I seriously doubt this has anything to do about any scars or less than 100 percent mobility on your part. Maybe you can ease into the penetrative relations by being on top. My wife even suggests you have a \"safe word\" if you start to feel any discomfort or pain. You need to sit down and communicate with your husband about your readiness and NEED for intimacy...which is also part of reclaiming your physical life back. Don't do this in the bedroom at midnight wearing nothing but a smile...he may go back on the defensive. This conversation would probably go better in private/not public after a good supper cuddled up on the couch watching a random tv show that basically is on for background noise.\n\nHonestly, I think he is still terrified and stuck in \"caregiver\" mode. This man absolutely loves you, and he showed his dedication while you were at the hospital and getting your rehab. You miss the intimacy, and that is understandable. You experienced physical and emotional trauma...your husband still experienced emotional trauma because he feels like he almost lost you and heard everything during the accident he couldn't protect you from. You both could use some individual and couples therapy.",
            "My wife had a horrific accident 4 months ago and we just barely became intimate again.  It's still extremely rough for both of us.  She desperately wants it to be normal again, but I'm terrified of causing her physical pain during the act.  Our first couple attempts resulted in her crying out in physical pain.  Please don't rush it and take it slow with your husband.  The mental trauma of seeing your wife hurting is strong.  Forgive the antiquated gender roles, but I believe most of us men would strongly prefer the physical trauma happen to us than our wives.",
            "I feel that if that had happened to me, would want some time to ensure you are not in pain or whatsoever (as women never say what they think, or choose to avoid it for the time being), and gain some power after so much effort put from your husband. For sure, you want it and he wants it. But, he may be really tired and wants some hugs. Begin with hugs for a while and don't give up. You are both young.",
            "My wife was in a car accident and spent several years recovering.\n\nIt's how I learned Partner PTSD was a thing, the mere mention of a few trigger words and my heart starts pounding and my hands shake.\n\n\nI love my wife more than I back ever properly express, and I still desire her just as much now as on our first date.\nBut the memories of seeing her stuck in that pit of pain, confusion, and despair, and watching her recover, slowly... She's a fucking baller, but I can't see her suffer again, ever. \n\nWe have sex but not nearly as often as before the accident, I can't help but remember what happened and how close I came to losing her. Not great for setting a romantic scene, I assure you! \n\nHe loves you and quite likely wants you, but he's afraid.\n\nStill sucks, I hope you two can figure it out",
            "I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re feeling rejected! I\u2019d just try communicating with him about the situation. Let him know how his reaction made you feel",
            "Maybe see a therapist or go on a vacation to completely change things up",
            "Couples therapy. Also try to discuss it away from bed. I have a life changing injury i cant recover from, and I had to be very specific with my partner that I will say stop straight away if something hurts during sex. He was nervous for a while. Perhaps start with masturbation next to each other, then hands and oral for a while. Build up to piv. Best of luck",
            "Honestly, you both need to get counseling and/or therapy. This obviously affected both of you greatly and you need to seek help.",
            "Speak to him. And please get therapy for both of you. I guarantee he is traumatised by what happened. That doesn\u2019t go away.",
            "I think I might have perspective on this. I broke my arm earlier this year. Hubs went into caretaker mode, much like your husband did. He went way above and beyond what I needed, but he needed to take care of me. \n\nHe started talking about me dying, or rather, he doesn't know if he can handle another wife dying. (His first wife died after a three year battle with cancer) He would not be intimate with me, even if I thought it was okay. He kept saying no, or just holding me. \n\nTo top it off, I have long covid. I have my symptoms managed, but if I slip up, I'm sick for days. \n\nIn his head, I was fragile. Very fragile. We had to have a very deep conversation about my physical and mental state before he was able to grasp that I'm not going to die. Still though, he's taking things slowly. There are a lot of hugs and holding, but not much more. \n\nIf you haven't had any actual conversations, and let him talk about his feelings, please do that. Not just one, several. Your incident traumatized him. He needs to heal now too.",
            "This is one of those things that will probably only be solved with tons of communication (outside of sexual expectations), and a comprension on your part that, despite you having been the one in the accident, he also suffered a lot of emotional pain, that needs to be eased sufficiently before getting back into a sexual state of mind.",
            "It's not quite the same, but my mom was in an induced coma for months, on the precipice of death, especially the first couple of months. She has a lot of continuing medical issues, but doesn't remember much of anything while in that state. \n\nI've spoken to her about the way she looked, and things that happened while she was under, that medical practitioners did. \n\nFor me they are vivid, traumatic memories.  For her, stories, that are distant, like hearing about it happening to someone else. \n\nYour husband is certainly traumatized. He may also have some guilt about being on the phone with you. Playing in his mind that you may have reacted quicker, or better to the situation if not focused on the conversation.  Maybe even for you being out on the road in the first place. \n\nWithout talking about it, and getting counseling for the trauma, this will be ongoing, most likely get worse. \n\nGlad you're doing so much better.",
            "hes clearly loves you alot just give more time he doesnt want hurt you",
            "My question is, if he's worried that your body is too fragile for penetrative sex, then why not just touch you and get you off in other ways? Is there any intimacy between you too? Intimacy can be expressed in various ways. I'm not surprised you're worried about his behavior.",
            "I was in a car accident once and spent about a year recovering. Once I was recovered enough for sex I wanted it, but my husband was very afraid of hurting me. I had him talk to my doctor directly to ask questions and once he was satisfied he wouldn\u2019t break me he went to town. \n\nIf he hasn\u2019t spoken to your doctor yet, I\u2019d start there. If he has and still seems to have a mental block then therapy for sure. Just remember that it is 100% clear your husband loves and cherishes you. Whatever is going on has nothing to do with him being repelled or anything like that.",
            "You wonderful, incredible woman! \n\nHe is terrified, he doesn\u2019t live inside your body or understand how great you\u2019re feeling.\n\nLike all of your rehab treatments, communication here goes a long long way. \n\nSurprising him at this point is another shock to his system, start small - work your way toward sex. Your body and you need that as well. Be safe, be gentle, be super intimate and talk through every single thing that you\u2019re about to do and talk talk talk\n\nYou both need to learn how to be intimate together again - you got this, it\u2019s going to be so sweet and caring and beautiful when it does happen",
            "The day of the accident you were physically injured, but he was traumatized. He needs psychological attention. Support him as he was for you all this time. He may put the blame on him for distracting you on the phone. There's nothing more harmful in life than blaming yourself for the incident of a partner.",
            "My ex delivered our baby. While it was a magical experience, it was traumatic for him because I didn\u2019t do well and the delivery was crazy too. He had a hard time being close to me for a long time. I can only imagine the trauma your husband had. \nMaybe just try closeness that\u2019s non sexual for a while and see if he can be intimate .

            "I know a friend who went through a similar thing. The wife had to take care of the husband for a long time and afterwards the attraction was gone. They stayed together for their children for like 10 years then divorced when the kids were adults. \n\nI think couples therapy is the move if this continues much longer. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone has done anything wrong.",
            "I can see people have already suggested this and your edited post says it too, but therapy and counselling should be considered.\nThere could be some trauma or feelings he doesn\u2019t know how to express, or doesn\u2019t know he has, since the accident\n\nAll the best",

            "Read the update and am so happy for you. As I was reading the initial post I was thinking how this must have been incredibly traumatic for him as well. I can\u2019t imagine that feeling of helplessness. Couples therapy sounds great for you two, but it might also be worth him seeking out his own individual therapy for a while. It might be helpful for both of you, and enhance the couples therapy process, if he has another neutral space to profess his feelings. \n\nSo glad that you are okay and that you are finding a way to move through this! Sounds like there\u2019s just SO much love between the two of you and I\u2019m here for it",

Harvey never forgot about Adkins, though. In 2017, after his wife died, he searched for Adkins on Google and discovered she had also become widowed. He sent her a card with his phone number and after chatting for a bit, Harvey drove 500 miles to visit her, stopping only for gas and a bouquet of carnations. \"I handed her the flowers, and then I cupped her face in my hand and said, 'Whether you like it or not, I\u2019m going to kiss you,'\" he recalled. In October, the high school sweethearts married at a '50s-style diner and danced to Johnny Mathis\u2014just like they did at prom 63 years earlier.",

        "selftext": "[My first post is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ecgbv/i_30_f_am_sitting_in_the_back_of_my_rv_as_my/) The TLDR of the first post is that I bought an RV with my money so I could write/travel in it while husband is away for business. Husband insisted on taking the RV with him without me, I convinced him to let me come. Now he is ranting about how he doesn't want me on the trip while I sit in the back of the RV hating my life.\n\nI promised I would update, but things got very hectic and this is the first chance I have gotten. This whole situation makes me very emotional, so please forgive me if this post is not as coherent as I would like it to be.\n\nWhen I posted my first post, we were on the road in the RV and my husband was giving me the cold shoulder while he bitched at me from the driver's seat. You all had some great advice for me about what I should do, and I listened to a few people who suggested that he might be cheating on me.\n\nTim had left his iPad in the back of the RV to charge while he drove. I'm not proud of this, but I was able to sneak his iPad into the bedroom while he was distracted by the road. He was logged into his email account and I quickly skimmed over his inbox but didn't find anything suspicious. I then had the idea to check his sent folder and found out that he had been chatting up his ex from college. It made me sick to my stomach to read the messages, but luckily they had not yet been physical. Translated from chatspeak, the message he had sent his ex was basically: \"I can't wait to get my hands on you! It's been years since I felt that mouth. I'm excited!\" \n\nI was disgusted, but I tried to keep calm. We were on the road headed to another state and we planned on stopping at his mother's house. I knew that if his messages were in the sent folder, that meant that he had deleted them. Tim was not planning on being caught and was trying to hide his tracks. He wanted my RV so that he could take his ex around the state and have fun without leaving a credit card trace. I took photos of the emails and sent them to myself in order to preserve the evidence. I then went back to the front of the RV and acted as if everything was fine. I apologized (don't worry, I lied) for how I had acted and suggested that we ask his mom to help us work through this. Tim said that he was sorry and that he accepted my apology. He said he was looking forward to using the RV in the future and that he was glad I had come to see reason. I smiled and nodded but on the inside I was cursing his existence.\n\nWe made it to his mom's house and I made up an excuse about having to change because my clothes were wrinkled. Tim went inside without me and I started throwing all of his clothes and belongings into a trashbag. I then went inside the house and Tim was sitting with his mom in the kitchen. He asked me what I was doing with the bag and I told him that I was giving him his clothes so that I could leave. Tim then got angry and asked me what the fuck was I doing and his mom was simply confused. She asked me what was going on and I told her, \"I'm not sure myself. I'm waiting for Tim to explain why he was planning to cheat on me with his ex.\"\n\nTim's mom then started to cry and yell at Tim while he tried to calm her down. I know Reddit does not have a lot of love for religion, but Tim's mother is a fundamentalist. She had loved me from the minute Tim introduced me to her and it would be an understatement to say that she was very upset with her adulterous son. Tim never tried to apologize to me, instead he chased after his mother saying he was sorry to her. This made her cry harder, because she knew that he wasn't even trying to make amends with me, he was just apologizing to her. She hugged me and told me to just go home and she would handle her son. I thanked her and took the RV keys from Tim (this ended up being a minor wrestling match) and left. I drove home crying, but at least I got rid of my asshole ex-husband.\n\nTim called me the next day and begged me to come back to him. He said it was all a mistake, that he was sorry. I asked him why he didn't apologize at his mother's house, why he didn't say he was sorry when I was handing him his bag. I told him that he didn't care about cheating on me, that all he cared about was how bad it made him look to his family. He tried to explain himself, but I cut him off and hung up. I blocked him on all social media and haven't heard anything since. \n\nI have gotten a lawyer and have already started the divorce process. \n   \n**tl;dr**: Husband thought he could get away with cheating on me by using my RV. I found his emails, packed his bags, and left him at his mom's house. His mom took my side and has ripped into him since. I got a lawyer and have filed for divorce.",

Firstly, thank you all for your advice (and **no thank you**) to the few who took it upon themselves to DM me to be inappropriate or creepy - wtf, read the room).\n\nIt gets a little intense, so first I'll just cover some things I wasn't able to in my original post.\n\nI trust my boyfriend completely. Even if I didn't, this apartment is large, not massive....I know where that beloved MF is 24/7. A lot of you asked when after my housemates confession he told me about it: he  told me a couple of hours afterwards. He explained to me after we had a chat about it that he was afraid I wouldn't believe him or be angry, because at first he'd thought it was a weird joke that made him uncomfortable, and he felt (rightly so) weirded out. I agree with the bulk of you that her continued touching is harrassment, and while a number suggested he just confront her himself, I empathise with being in a situation without breathing room where someone is sexually harrassing you. It's not easy, and you can quickly find yourself unsure if those brief moments of crossing a line happened. He's not on our lease, and understandably he was concerned about me and the power dynamic in the house (bc her room is a mini granny flat, she pays the bigger share).\n\nI also don't believe that it was, as some suggested, a hypomanic episode. I have BP2 and while I understand the 'love rush', she exhibited zero other behaviours, and never tried to contact my BF outside of the weird touching. I also can appreciate there's no way she was actually in 'love'.\n\nSO:\n\nYesterday, after a tense few days of trying to avoid her, my BF and I were in the kitchen at breakfast, with her around in the living area. I went to 'our' bathroom (she has an en suite) which is just off the main area to brush my teeth. I walked back out to grab my phone as she was sidling behind my boyfriend who was looking in the fridge, and caught her *running her hand and forearm across his lower back where his tee shirt had ridden up a little*. My boyfriend, who didn't see me, yelped really loudly and just lost it. He yelled at her to \"stop!\" and when they both saw me he starts going \"you see?! You see?! This is what I was talking about!\"\n\nI was furious, just whole body anger, and I could see she had now realised he HAD told me about her confession/behaviour, and just sprinted to her room and slammed the door. My BF and I went out for a walk to calm down, and he kept apologising for not being \"more firm\", but he was shaken up - some of you told me I should just confront her head on, which in the moment I 100% sided with, I was so angry for him. He told me he'd rather give her the opportunity to do it diplomatically. I appreciated what you guys said about lock down being extenuating, and in discussion with our mutual friend, I was willing to believe that an element of it was naivete, and a bit of fantasy gone too far. I was willing to be kind to her.\n\nWhen we returned with a plan of action, we knocked on her door but she didn't answer. We tried a couple of times but she wouldn't come out, although she was 'seeing' my Whatsapp messages. Come late afternoon, I was just over it, so I knocked, and told her I was coming in. I sat her down on her bed and told her gently but firmly it was inappopriate, making us uncomfortable, told her she had to get the hell over it/herself if she intended to continue to live with us. She burst into tears and starts crying about how she's \"so sorry\" and what a \"bad person' she is, and she can't believe the pressure of lockdown is getting to her, whatever, and I felt bad. Started sympathising, trying to be compassionate...and then she says \"It's just so unfair that the guy I'm in love with has a really great girlfriend\".\n\nReader, I lost my shit. Unfair, *my ass.* I told her she had a lot of growing up to do, and perspective to learn, and that she owed the house an apology. She started to have a meltdown, a full, weeping, hiccuping snotty meltdown. *AND THEN*  when I stood up to leave, I spotted, in her clothes rack, my freaking shirt. I took it, and went back to my room.\n\nMy housemate cried loudy with the door OPEN until 7PM (for....attention???) when I cracked. I used our emergency contact sheet, called her mum, told her she had to come pick up my housemate. I've never met this woman who came rushing in like a superstar, but the look of annoyance and embrassament on her face when she arrived and found her 27 y/o daughter having a tantrum told me this wasn't a new part of her personality. My housemate also STFU pretty quickly after she realised her mum was there. They didn't say anything to us, and we just hid in our room until they were gone. I think she'll be gone at least for a while, but I texted her to let her know it would be best if she texted me before she came back. IDK when I'll see her. Technically the lease ends in August so my BF and I think we can make it work and find someone new, and if not, it's not so long til we can resign without her.\n\nAs a coda to all this?? My BF mentioned if she took a blouse, maybe she took other stuff too. I appreciate some of you may consider this an invasion of privacy, but I did go back in, just to check the clothes rack. I found: a set of my jeans, my tee shirt, one of my boyfriends work shirts, a vinyl I owned, my fucking charm bracelet from when I was a KID from inside my jewellery box, and a sheet of my old antidepressants...this was just what was on the rack/on display. I imagine there's more in the drawers. I don't know if this was the right thing to do, but I left them there for now bc I don't want there to be any 'doubt' she stole them.  There's zero chance she's going to live here any more. Honestly, I hope she does get help. I'm really angry and violated, as is my BF, but I can empathise with the havoc an uncontrolled mental health issue can wreak on your behviour, and while it's still wrong, it still sucks for her to experience it and lose friends. NOTE: *I can't be sure, none of us can! But I feel like maybe (?) she has a histrionic personality disorder.*\n\nTL;DR: my relatively normal housemate who told my BF she was in love with him turned out to also be a thief. Yikes!!\n\nPS! Our mutual friend has told me another friend who went to school with my housemate had told her a rumour she'd told a bunch of people in their year that she had leukemia.

            "I would just go ahead and take your stuff back, especially your medication and bracelet. She already stole from you so if you give her the chance surely she will try and lie to cover it up. Maybe it\u2019s going to far but if it were me I would look through her things to retrieve anything else of yours that may be in there.",
            "That\u2019s a whole lot of yikes. I personally think you should go back and get your shit. You know she stole it. She knows. Unless you\u2019re pressing charges it doesn\u2019t matter.

            "Hi! I don't know if this'll go to the top or just get lost in the bottom - but I'm going to just go in and take my stuff. I think recording me doing it might be weird, and legally iffy. I'm also not really concerned that she could be violent or aggressive if she came back, I think the whole situation has been pretty humiliating for her. It kind of seems like it's about eliciting attention or sympathy. How much she felt was genuine and how much was manfactured and magnified to feed that need, IDK. I still hope she's okay. I've definitely let my health issues push people away before (albeit, never so dramatically) so I don't think I'll be calling her crazy.  \nMy boyfriend pointed out that I wore my jeans last week and that we'd all been listening to the binyl in the living space a couple of weeks ago, so I'm kind of interested to see if this was maybe an episode or an ongoing but usually managed thing? I also only switched my medication at the end of April but I have zero clue if the foil pack I found was my discarded last lot or taken before I changed.  \n\n\nAnyway!

I hope you won\u2019t have to deal with her much more and you can continue on with your life without the unnecessary extra stress! You handled it really well.",
            "Youve been so kind to her in dealing with this really fucked up incident. Stand up for yourself and what's yours. She's a me tally unstable thief. Just go take your shit while there's less chance of confrontation and I'm sure it'll go smoother than trying to go through all of her things with her when she gets back. Good luck. Sorry your roommate is an asshole.",
            "The original post and update sounds like it could the beginnings of one of those Lifetime Movie Network plotlines.\n\nI'm going to agree with some of the other's here... Take the rest of your shit back now. It's no telling what else she's taken from your and your bf.",
            "Take pictures of your stuff where you find it and take it. Actually take a video of you entering the room and show your belongings and take them back. They are YOURS. Send a video to her mother and say you won\u2019t be pressing charges as long as it\u2019s clear that daughter needs to find a new place to live ASAP. Tell her you don\u2019t know what your boyfriends decision is yet",
            "I understand the mental health, but do you understand she sounds crazy too? I mean she is stealing things, knowingly when to approach your boyfriend and has manipulated you in ways that now you feel sorry for her? She got you, I will say take your stuff and let her mother deal with her mental health or whatever issues she has, why are you feeling responsable?",
            "Get your stuff back but ensure you have proof, the last thing you need is if it all goes topsy turfy is legal issues. It's a really messed up situation and I feel for you, cut out the slackers and drips in your life, she doesn't deserve you as a previous freind.",
            "yeah.. she needs help for sure",
            "OP, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this!\n\nMy ex step-sister (parents are now divorced) also had a habit of stealing my things. I initially did a sweep before she moved out because I noticed her wearing a shirt of mine and had mutual friends tell me she was bragging about me not noticing missing stuff. I didn\u2019t want to believe it at all but when I went in her room, I found SO MUCH STUFF, and, like you, I decided to leave it be so I could confront her. But the very next day a very sentimental necklace went missing. I waited till she was out of the house and told my dad, then asked him to witness (and even film) me going through the room so NOTHING would come back making me look like the guilty one.\n\nI would suggest you go through her entire room before she comes home and either photograph each item that\u2019s yours (while it\u2019s still in her stuff before you take it back to your room) or just have your BF film the entire thing. When you find something that\u2019s yours, Mental health problems etc. aside, this girl may have an addiction to stealing and you may lose things that you\u2019ll never ever get back if you don\u2019t!",
            "I would pack her stuff up for her. Just so you nothing else was stolen. Bummer about your roommate. I get covid has people thirsty or whatever but she was 100% wrong.",
            "She doesn't look like a very mentally stable person be careful lock your door when you fall sleep or you might find her inside your room staring at you and your bf",
            "This is why people need to get guns and carry at all times to be honest.",
            "She was trying to manipulate you by saying how hard lockdown was and then crying loudly and stuff. Also why would she take your stuff like wtf it sounds like she wanted to be you and so that came with wanting to be with your man. Its all messed up",
            "I had an old roommate steal from me. It sucks dude. She tried to commit suicide the morning of the day we were supposed to move out, so her parents (who were out of state) asked me to pack her things for her. As I went through I found a bunch of my clothes I thought I misplaced, including my favorite hoodie from my best friend, my shorts, some underwear, and a vibrator (who the fuck steals a used vibrator??? Ew.)\n\nJust take your stuff back, she\u2019ll never admit to it. Good luck OP.",
            "Just take your stuff back!",
            "Not only did she steal your clothes, but she wanted to steal your bf too smh",
            "Absolutely make sure your medication is not in anything that could be considered her possession. You don't want some sort of legal he-said she-said where she accuses you of distributing a controlled substance in your name to her",
            "Go take your stuff back, it's yours. Otherwise, Jesus. I hope you get rid of this flatmate and out of your life ASAP.",
            "This sounds exactly like a girl I know, Whom I am convinced as a histrionic personality disorder.",

            "I find it so sad and disturbing that SO MANY people exhibit such mental instability to the point of creepy and dangerous. \n\nI mean, how the hell does their brain work? In what universe is it OK to steal and feel they are entitled to other people's boyfriends?\n\nWhat level of fucked up do you need to be to behave like that?  And the audacity to believe it's \"unfair\"....??  Wow...it just blows my mind...\n\nI was just reading yesterday about a girl who was living with her sister and the sister's boyfriend, thought she deserved him more and even got to the point of touching his genitalia while he was asleep! 100% unhinged. \n\nThis psycho needs to gtfo asap or you you wouldn't know what else she is capable of. I wouldn't put it past her to even consider physically harming you.",
            "I'm really sorry you are having to go through this.\n\nYou absolutely made the right decision to get her mom involved. She needs help and her mom can get that for her.\n\nBut THANK GOODNESS that lease is up in August! \n\nYou can use the time she's not there to make a plan and arrangements to get out.\n\nI also recommend keeping your escape plan private and set passwords for things. Make sure you both (your bf and yourself) have to authorize things. Just in case this roommate tries to pretend to be you or in case she comes back and tries to sabotage your plans.\n\nI'm so sorry your bf was having to deal with harassment. It's absolutely not okay what she was doing to him and I'm glad that he felt comfortable enough to let you know.\n\nNow you both can plan your next steps. \n\nHopefully she stays away and gets the help she needs.",

            "This story isn't real. Wake up sheeple!",
            "I don't have much to say, as you handled this excellently. But I just wanted to applaud how considerately you handled your boyfriend's feelings and needs. It's horrible feeling violated, and often the last thing you want to do is confront the person who did it. You really dealt with this incredibly well, your boyfriend is a lucky MF and that girl just sounds unhinged. Calling her mum was the best thing you could have done.",
            "This is the most high school thing I've read in a long time. \n\nAlso - \n\n>I agree with the bulk of you that her continued touching is harrassment, and while a number suggested he just confront her himself, I empathise with being in a situation without breathing room where someone is sexually harrassing you.\n\nWhy can't a 31-year-old say \"Please stop touching me; it's inappropriate\" from the outset, instead of waiting and having a meltdown? I've been in the same situation - at work, even. I used my words and they stopped."
