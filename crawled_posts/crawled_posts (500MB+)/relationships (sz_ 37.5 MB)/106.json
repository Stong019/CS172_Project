        "selftext": "My girlfriend and I have been together for 6 years, I know she's been wanting to get married and wanting for me to propose for a really long time. I've always put it off cause I never felt I was at the right spot for it, and I wanted to wait for the right time.  Nevertheless, I know she's been waiting for it patiently for a long time, and if it was up to her, we would have gotten married years ago before I was even ready.\n\nAnyway, I figured since she's waited so long, I wanted to make it as perfect for her as possible.  I chose the weekend of our 6th anniversary of our first date to propose to her.  I was planning to have her come over to our house, I would have my mum and sister vacate for the night, and I would prepare a very nice dinner for her and would propose during that.\n\nI had written out this really long speech which I'd memorised after much practice because I wanted it to be perfect.\n\nNow my girlfriend has always wanted me to learn how to cook. I'm ashamed to say I've never properly learned how to cook, and I've never been really good at it.  Since I live with my mother and sister at home, they always cook for me and they've never really needed me to cook. Its always one or the other of them, or both of them, doing cooking.  At best, I'd just do washing up or chop up onions or something simple.\n\nI told them \"look, I desperately need to learn how to cook a very nice meal.\" I told them she's always wanted me to learn how to cook, and it would be great if I could surprise her with this excellent dinner that I've made myself, she would never expect it from me, she would be thrilled.  I told them I might just need some guidance.\n\nThey weren't that enthusiastic first, they were like \"we're really busy, we don't have time to teach a child how to cook.\" I told them its really important, and to help them understand the gravity of the situation, I told them I was proposing tonight.\n\nThey both went crazy and excited, like \"oh my God oh my God, have you bought a ring yet?\"  I showed them the ring, and my sister went flipping crazy, screaming, crying tears.  I told them I was probably going to ask for their opinion on it any way, and they were really enthralled and so excited and happy for me.  My sister was literally crying and breathing heavily.\n\nThey asked for details and everything about how I was going to propose, I recited the long speech I'd memorised.  They told me it was beautiful, they love it, she'll love it, again my sister was crying even.\n\nI told them so this is why I need to cook tonight, she's always wanted me to learn to cook, and if I make a nice meal for her, I want to make our night as magical as possible.  My sister was like \"no way, if you cook, you'll fuck it up. Just let us cook for you, and say you did it.\" I said, no, it has to be me, it has to be me. It's really important that I do it, I don't want to deceive her.\n\nWe reached a compromise and they said we can do it together, my mum supervised, my sister will take charge, and I'll basically just follow instructions and help her out.  It turned out going really good, but how much I really contributed is questionable, they ended up taking way too much over me, way more than I had planned. I had wanted to do it all myself with their guidance, but I ended up being just a 'helper' while my sister did most of the work.  I didn't want to let that spoil the night so I just let it go.\n\nThen my girlfriend arrived at the door, and my mum and sister were getting ready to go out.  When they greeted her, my mum was acting cool, polite, very poker face about it, I guess cause she's a mature adult.  My sister on the other hand was acting like a jittery little school girl, just jumping out, it was really cringey and awkward to watch.  She kept telling my girlfriend how beautiful she looked tonight, how excited she was for her, how we were perfect for each other.  The way she was smiling and acting too excited really gave it all away, she said \"he's got something really really special planned for you.\"\n\nI kept trying to push her out the door and telling her to shut up, but she just wouldn't, and she kept chatting to my girlfriend. I wanted to push her out, by my girlfriend told me I was being rude to her, and I should let the talk.  I just sighed and knew it would end badly, but my sister kept being as unsubtle as possible, \"I really wish I could be a fly on the wall here tonight\" \"you are so so lucky\" \"if only you knew\".\n\nMy girlfriend was then \"is he going to propose?\" My sister didn't say yes or no, she just gritted her teeth in a big smile like \"mmmnnnnngghhhhh :) :) :) :) \"  I didn't even get a chance to say anything, and my girlfriend just started screaming and crying and hugging me suffocating me.  My mum was trying to pull my sister away, but she just started screaming \"SHOW HER THE RING! SHOW HER THE RING!\" I told her to seriously shut the fuck up, and that my mum was clearly waiting for her ,but she kept shouting \"show her the ring!\".  I tried to explain to them that this really wasn't the way I had planned it, I wanted to do it when we were alone and I had  a long speech planned.  They both just wanted to see the ring.  I said can I at least say the speech? My sister was like \"you should let him say it, its a really beautiful speech.\"  I started and I'd barely got two sentences in when she interrupted me and was like \"actually its too fucking long, you can say it later, just show her the ring.\"\n\nI wanted to wait until we were alone so I could say the speech and THEN show the ring, but they were both literally screaming at me to show them. I told my sister she'd already seen it, she said she wanted to see it again and my girlfriend told me I had to show it to her now. I showed them the ring again and they both started shouting and screaming, they literally both jumped on me and pinned me to the couch like a lion grappling a dying elephant, and ripped the ring from my hand like a lion tearing meat from its prey.  I told them to get off they were suffocating me, but they were both literally hugging me to death while screaming like hyenas into my ears. It was like WWE or something, it was unreal.  I tried to pull away but they were both just hugging and kissing me and screaming into my ears, clawing at me and the ring like rapid animals, squeezing and suffocating me; my mother did nothing to help, she just stood there laughing as I went down.\n\nI realised they were mainly interested in the ring so I let them have it and crawled away to the side of the couch where I could breath properly. I felt the evening was ruined already, I had nearly just been clawed to death, I didn't know if my clothes were ripped, my hair was completely messed up, I had both their lipsticks smudged on my face from their dual hyena attack, and my clothes were a complete mess now.  It was an infuriating mess of a situation and I felt gross.  I just sat quietly there for at least two hours while my mother, girlfriend, and sister sat together looking at the ring, talking and chatting amongst themselves and acting like I wasn't there.\n\nThe entire evening was ruined.  My mum and sister were meant to be going out for the night, they didn't even leave once and were there the entire time.  The food that \"I\" had made was getting cold.  I told them dinner was getting cold, they all said they weren't hungry, and just sat there looking at the ring, obsessing over it like they are freaking gollum or something.\n\nMe, the boyfriend, the groom, may have as well been invisible, they were all completely ignoring me, pretending like I wasn't there.  I had planned this perfect evening between my girlfriend and I were I could propose, I'd been preparing it for such a long time. It was completely hijacked by my mother and sister, my sister spoiled it, and didn't even feel bad about it.  Worst of all, my girlfriend didn't even seem to mind.\n\nI told her this wasn't the evening I had in mind, she didn't care, she was too excited about the fact we're finally engaged.  I didn't even get a chance to say my speech.  She was like \"don't worry you can say it tomorrow, I'm too tired now.\"  It really hurt my feelings, I don't think she understood how sad that made me feel.\n\nMy girlfriend didn't even seem to care that it wasn't even really me who proposed to her,and the way my sister was acting, you'd think like she was the one getting married.  This entire evenign I'd planned out for so long... I'd been entirely cut out of it. Sidelined. Reduced to a spectator.\n\nAfter we finally did have the dinner, I asked my girlfriend if we could spend some time together in bed before she goes back home for the night.  She was like \"we can't, your mum and sister are here, we can't just leave them.\"  I told her they weren't even meant to be here, they were meant to have gone out tonight, and they both were like \"yeah, yeah, go upstairs, don't worry about us.\" I told her she really shouldn't worry about them , we should both just go upstairs and spend some time together, she was like no, it would feel too weird and awkward.\n\nWell, that sucked so much. i felt like the entire night was ruined. I'd barely gotten anything out of it, I didn't even spend any time with my girlfriend.  My sister completely spoiled and ruined everything, the entire night was hijacked.\n\nI tried to explain to my girlfriend why everything that had happened, including her own behaviour and acceptance of it, really bothered me.  She didn't seem to understand and just brushed it aside. I explained to my mum, and she sort of understood and was apologetic, but tried to dump most of the blame on my sister.  My sister was still in an excited giddy mood, I asked her what was wrong with her, she said nothing. I told her she'd ruined the entire night and she acted like a 12 year old or a clown, she got offended and denied it.  She refused to see what she'd done wrong and how she'd ruined everything.  I don't undersetand her behaviour at all or why she would even act that way.\n\nBasically, I'm kind of hurt and offended by everything that's happened and the way they reacted to it.  Do I have the right to feel this way? Should I just let it go and move on or is there something I can do so that my grievances don't go unaddressed and ignored?\n\n**TLDR: planned a magical evening with my girlfriend (of six years) to propose to her.  My sister and mother spilled the beans on everything, hijacked it, and ruined the entire night.  Everyone completely ignored me when it was supposed to be a night of my girlfriend and I.  Nobody acts like they did anything wrong, they all think it was perfectly fine and brush aside it when I try to explain how hurt I am by what they all did and how I didn't like being basically pushed to the side, ignored for hours, and ruining all my plans. Am I right to feel this way? What should I do about it?**\n\nedit: spelling corrections",

            "Actually you are not engaged. You did not propose. She did not say yes. \n\nYour sister told her you were planning to propose. She screamed. You showed the ring. No proposal, no answer.\n\nI suggest you take the ring, tell your girlfriend that you never even asked her and that you will not consider yourself engaged until you have had your proposal.",

            "Ugh this is a mess. First off you really need to figure out your own independence. 24 and engaged isn't a good look if your still living with your mum and sis and have literally 0 adulting experience.\n\nMy quick list of recommendations BEFORE getting married:\n\n* Move out\n\n* Learn to cook (this one's easy, just google basic cooking skills such as chopping, cleaning, sauteeing, grilling, and baking. Then put those skills to use on a few basic recipes)\n\n* Talk with your fiancee about your concerns and her lack of acknowledgement of your concerns. \n\n* Start paying for all your own stuff.\n\n* Learn how to clean, do laundry, pay bills, ect if you haven't already.\n\nThese are all necessary adulting stuff that your need to know. I wouldn't even think about getting married before you can do all of that. Otherwise you are setting yourself for \"16 and pregnant\" levels of dissapointment.",

The. Fuck  \n  \nAnyway, it seems like they were far more interested in the ring than the proposal of marriage.      \n  \n> \"don't worry you can say it tomorrow, I'm too tired now.\"  \n  \nToo tired to be told about your undying love for her? What a load of crap.  \n  \nEDIT: Please come back and post an update.  \nYou need let us know how your sister attempts to make herself heard at your wedding.  \nShe might even wear a white dress and cut across the best mans speech to announce she's pregnant",
            "Ok so your sister and your mom obviously think of you as a child - but how much of that is because you let them? Why can't you cook? In this day and age I really don't understand that statement - you can look up every recipe known to man and follow it, that's cooking right there. Or is it that you're so used to them taking care of you that you didn't want to try?\n\nYour sister sounds selfish and attention-seeking, and your mom should have realized how intrusive they were being. But...if they're used to running your life for you (again, because you kind of let them...), why would tonight be any different?\n\nAs far as your fianc\u00e9e. She may have gotten caught up in it and not really registered that you really were disappointed. I would bring it up again in a day or two, phrase it how you're disappointed that you didn't get to have the night you planned ALONE WITH HER, and see how she reacts once the initial excitement has faded a bit. If she still thinks it's no big deal...dude, you might be engaged to a clone of your mother/sister, and that can end nowhere good.",

            "> I've never properly learned how to cook, and I've never been really good at it. Since I live with my mother and sister at home, they always cook for me and they've never really needed me to cook\n\nSon has it ever occurred to you that as a man that is 24 years old, you should be capable of being independent enough that you don't have to rely on other people to prepare you food? Have you ever thought about learning to cook because you need it, not because other people need you to? Have you ever thought about pulling your own weight not because others need you to or want you to, but because it is simply the right thing to do?\n\nThe way you phrase your post, maybe it's just cultural differences, but you sound a bit immature. Your sister and your fiancee jumping all over you - you call it a double hyena attack. Does that not sound callous or disrespectful towards your fiancee? You describe your fiancee and sister freaking out over the ring as if it were a life and death situation, what with all the wilderness metaphors, which I understand if you're going for comedic hyperbole, but the story implies you were upset about that. \n\nYou describe the fact that you proposed to your girlfriend at 24 as if she were waiting forever - 24 is a perfectly ordinary age to get married. Getting married at 21 is rarely a good idea, as it requires a good match. You don't seem to have fully formed an adult identity yet, how are you feeling up for getting married already??\n\nFrankly, your whole family (possibly also along with your fiancee) seems to be set in this ... quite tight-knit dynamic, which is fine if everyone is aware and consenting, but the way you describe it, it seems you haven't ever questioned it or even thought about it much. Maybe it's time to have a good think about things and ask yourself whether the way you act and react has a good basis in your character and value system, and whether it is the way you want yourself to act and react, being an adult. Your sister seems to be just as immature and she's 25. I can understand excitement, but the way she went about telling your fiancee about the proposal while \"keeping plausible deniability\" (not really...) is just mind-boggling to me. ",
            "Just to be clear,  did you ever actually ask her to marry you, or did you just give her the ring?\n\nAlso, your sister who is a year older then you, called you a child at 24.\n\n",
            "I'm not saying that your family acted well. I'm just saying you need to move out and cut the cord. \n\nLiterally every single problem here could have been solved by either having your own place or keeping your sister and mother out of the proposal in any sense (them not knowing, them not helping you cook) and buying them a spa day/theater tickets \"just because you guys treat me so well and you deserve it\". \n\nNow, your girlfriend shouldn't have ignored you, but I can see why she acted how she did. You let your sister and mother control the night and didn't stand up for yourself. If your girlfriend tried to stand up for the two of you or asked them to leave, then she would have looked like the mean woman stealing their son/brother away from them. How can you expect your fiance to stand up against your family if you won't? If the situations were reversed, would you really want to have sex/have an intimate moment knowing that her father and brother were just down the hall/downstairs and would probably hear everything through the walls? I don't think so. \n\nIf you needed to learn how to cook, you should have started to watch cooking shows or take a cooking class at least a month in advance. \n\nIf you wanted some alone time, you should have made sure your family and your girlfriend didn't overlap at all. \n\nIf you wanted the proposal to be a surprise, you shouldn't have told anyone about it!\n\nIf you want to be treated like a mature adult, start acting like one.

            "You and your sister clearly still have the dynamic of young children.  Your sister has no impulse control and still views you as her baby brother.  For the love of all things holy, MOVE OUT, demonstrate that you are an independent adult, and plan another proposal that your mom cannot ruin because it isn't in her own home.",
            "Wow. I would be re-thinking that marriage proposal, if I were you. \n\nAnd I DEFINITELY wouldn't trust my sister with literally anything, ever again. \n\nEdit: because I find the way that your girlfriend continually dismissed your feelings and wants/needs to be really concerning. ",
            "Your sister is awful. I'm sorry she did that to you. I'm guessing that's not out of character? \n\nYour girlfriend, I'm imagining her side of it. She waits six years for a proposal. The proposal is her bf's sister shouting and jumping around. But instead of being pissed or upset like a lot of people would be, she's just excited. You want to give her your speech, but does she really want to hear it with your mum and sister there? Probably not. You ask her to bed in front of them which she obviously doesn't want to do, that's just weird. \n\nYou have a poor grip on reality. You did not plan an elaborate proposal. You planned a regular evening with a ring and a speech. You waited until the day of to figure out what to cook. You did it at home which would be fine except that you failed to make sure you had the place to yourself. \n\nTalk to your girlfriend about it. Maybe do another proposal so you both get the evening you deserve! I'd hold off on the wedding though, you have a lot of growing up to do. ",
            "Do we know that OP lives in the US? Or if his family is from the states?\n\nI see a lot of comments about maturity, but to me this sounds like a pretty typical arrangement in lots of other countries/cultures: son living with family until marriage, women doing the cooking, all of the ladies in the family dead excited about the wedding. \n\nOP: I'm sorry it went down the way it did. I'd probably explain that your feeling were hurt and that you want a chance to actually propose. I'm not sure I'd ask for the ring back, but I'd for sure tell her that you had a really romantic evening planned and you want that to happen. \n\n",
            "If your GF does not undesrtand the situation & your hurt feelings then I have to say, your GF is yet to mature.\n\nOn the other hand, this is also why I think the whole creating a big \"Prefect Proposal\" with other people getting involved is not a good idea.

Honestly. \n\nI can understand being overly excited and happy over a proposal, but usually the reasons are because the person they love has finally proven their undying love and commitment, not because of some beautiful ring. \n\nI can also understand that she was probably heavily influenced by how your mum and sister reacted that she got lost in the moment. I can understand how heavily disappointed you were but I don't think it's a deal breaker. \n\nI'd sit down with your fianc\u00e9e and say that you would like to have proposed in a manner that you had originally planned for. Explain that you had made the effort into wanting it to be special. And that you thought she deserved it to be special. I would ask for the ring back when you are both alone and say that you would like to propose to her again. ",

I feel there is a problem if you expect to leap from you parents house to marriage where you expect your wife to turn into your Mom.  Maybe i'm reading into it too much, but what is your expectation for your marriage?  How will you get by?   I would figure out how to adult first.\n",
            "What they did was awful, but you LET IT HAPPEN. the ruining the proposal thing was stupid, but why did you show them the ring? Why did you let them take control. I feel bad for you but at the end of the day you need to grow up. \n\nAs for where to go from here, take the ring back, and tell gf that since you never actually got to propose, you two aren't engaged. You have a right to propose in your own way, and you never actually did because your narcissist sister had to be the centre of attention. If GF wants to be engaged, she has to let yoh propose. doesn't appreciate that, she's just as bad.\n\nAs for your sister, tell her that she totally betrayed your trust in ruining the surprise, plus she then stole your proposal by demanding you show the ring, and then not leaving for the entire night.

The fact that you tried to explain it and your sister didn't care is troubling. If you get married, definitely keep your sister out of the planning.\n\nSecond, your girlfriend ignoring your concerns/feelings about the matter is even more troubling. There's a question I've often heard repeated that applies to this situation, \"Are you looking for a marriage or a wedding?\"\n\nIt sounds like your girlfriend is only interested in having a rock on her finger, and not spending time with the person who gave it to her. Talk to her again in a day or two (to let the situation cool down), and if she still feels the same, you need to ask yourself, \"Do I want to legally obligate myself to someone who doesn't give a shit about my feelings, for the rest of my life?\"",

If you flip the genders even a little and the story becomes that your sister ruined your proposal for your fiance, there'd be demands of an apology. I think everyone so far is minimizing your feelings, asking you to suck it up. That's not cool. This was meant to be both of your day, not a day for your sister. \n\nTell everyone separately that you didn't appreciate their actions. You may not get the apologies you deserve, but you need to stick up for yourself to your family. Your sister and mother made this about them, everyone in this scenario decided they didn't give a crap how you feel.\n\nTalk to your fiance and explain how and why your feelings were hurt. You're allowed to care about an evening that was literally just as important for you as it was for her. A marriage is a partnership and you should both get to enjoy the proposal as well as the life together. Don't be accusatory, just explain what hurt your feelings.\n\nAdditionally, you guys haven't been living together and you're still pretty young. Premarital counseling is a must, I think. You guys want to set yourselves up for success with this marriage, and the counseling can help make sure you understand how to communicate with each other. Stuff gets different when you live together in a lot of ways. \n\nGood luck dude. Sorry the proposal went down like that.",
            "They were in the wrong.  However, if the cooking is that important, why the hell did you wait for the night of to learn how to cook?\n\nYou didn't really \"plan\" anything.  You shot from the hip, and frankly, this is how stuff goes when you shoot from the hip.",
            "There's a bible quote that rings true here, \"when I was a child I spoke as a child and thought as a child, but when I grew I put away childish things.\" You act like a helpless infant around your mother and sister and then are shocked that they treat you like a baby. You can't possibly expect them to take something like this seriously if they're still, for instance, cooking your food.  (Are they doing your laundry? Packing your lunch? Cleaning your room too?)\n\nBy the way, learning to cook a meal is a trial and error and error and error process. It won't happen in a day. ",
            "Wow, your proposal was hijacked so badly that you didn't even propose. I guess you aren't engaged yet, and have learned something valuable about how your family treats your important moments.\n\nI'm not sure your girlfriend is to blame--she was totally ambushed, too. But I also think this shows that neither of you are ready to get married (or engaged). You (both of you) didn't stand up for yourselves, and you need to be able to do that to have a functional relationship.",

It was really frustrating for me that we couldn't have alone time. I can totally see why you're upset about that bit especially.\n\nI would take the ring back, and tell her you didn't actually propose. If she raises a stink about it, maybe she isn't mature enough. If she simply asks why, tell her you want it to be special. If you decide to propose to her, pick another date that is important, and do it then.\n\nGood luck to you, please post an update!!!",
            "Fuck the engagement, elope. By yourself. Away from all of them. Learn to cook.",
            "Your sister acted like a shithead, but I have to ask: you're 24, living at home, and needed your mom's help to propose to your girlfriend. Do you feel you're ready to be married? What are your next steps from here? Seems like a really big leap to go from basically living a child's lifestyle to living a married life. Not trying to be mean, I know it may sound that way, I just feel like maybe you need to give yourself some time to grow up a little, get some life skills, and be your own person.",
            "Op. Yeah, your sister and mom did you wrong. Your mom should have pulled you sister aside, and also not shift blame. Your sister did indeed ruin stuff and you need to tell her. Maybe she's not close to getting married and needed to fill some void in her life with this. Who the hell knows. (Also, are you Asian?? This sounds like an Asian family....)\n\nBut you know who messed up the most? You did. This is arguably the most important event in your life to date and you procrastinated till the last minute. Everything sounds like it was put together at the last minute. You didn't clear the house schedule and you didn't know what to make for food. If you really wanted to propose well, you should have researched locations, easy meals that don't go cold, time it takes to cook, drive, and recruit friends or someone to photograph. You want an important moment to be special? You have to plan every moment; and while things might not always go the way you want it to, you can control the things you can control and still steer it in the direction you want.\n\n\nTL; dr: while I sympathize and can cringe at the details and be like wtf at your mom and sister, OP, ***YOU*** are the one who really effed up the proposal by not planning or learning how to cook by the time you wanted to propose. Take it as a lesson and learn from it. Because of you don't, this kind of behavior is going to come back and bite you in the ass.",
            "Seems like your sister loves to be the centre of attention and everyone in your family is enabling it. It is really sad that they ruined your night but you kind of let them do that. You seem kind of dependent on your mother and sister, which is kind of weird when you are 24 years old.\nIf your girlfriend gave a shit about your proposal, I would advise you to organise a new dinner where you tell her your speech, but honestly she only cared about the ring which is really really sad. \nIt's also really weird that she wanted to spend time with your mum and sister instead of you ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR \"PROPOSAL\" .\nEverything is so bizarre in this story and my best advice is to try to be more independent.",
            "Your girlfriend I can kind of understand because she would have just been happy you were going to, no matter how it turned up. \n\nYour sister and mother though, they have no excuse at all and shouldn't have hung around after it all came out. \n\nI would be asking your sister for a full apology for ruining what was supposed to be a special moment for you and your gf. It doesn't matter if she was excited for you, she knew it was important to you and ruined it. \n\nI would also keep both your mother and sister in the dark in future about anything important in future and let them find out at the same time as everyone else. ",
            "Listen, from what I can tell, you wanted to make your GF/Fiance happy. It seems that you wanting to marry her is enough. I can understand that you wanted it to be special; but it sounds like she didn't care if it was. \n\nI would let go and move on. Also, Lesson learned. Don't involve your mom and sister in your future romantic plans.\n",
            "Dude... I am not even sure what is happening here but what exactly is the relationship between your mom,sister and your gf?",

            "> *\"mmmnnnnngghhhhh :) :) :) :)\"* \n\nI cringed..\n\n",
            "It seems that they aren't thinking about the proposal as something particularly special to YOU too. \n\nThey are viewing it like, as long as the girlfriend is happy, who cares how it happened.\n\nHave you tried expressing to them that the magical moment you had envisioned was not ONLY for the girlfriend but for your own memories and excitement too? \n\nIt might never have even entered their minds that you have those feelings, as proposals and weddings are very female focused. ",
            "Now that you're engaged,  how long do you plan to be engaged before your wedding?  If it's more than 1 year, I'd suggest keeping your plan as an anniversary idea, only not at home and without telling your mother and sister.\n\nIn the meantime,  I'd suggest testing out living by yourself. You need to learn how to lead your own life before you can lead a family. \n\n",
            "Yes OP...you should move on. And by move on...I mean you should move out before you propose to your girlfriend. If you didn't want the surprise ruined...then you should've done things in a totally different order. Like learned to cook wayyy before THE EVENING you were planning to propose. And you should've done it somewhere like your own apartment. You sort of sound like a man-child. I'm sorry if that sounds harsh. But the way you described getting attacked by two women and Mommy not even coming to the rescue...well that makes you sound like you aren't ready to be your wife's partner. Are you going to rely on your bride to do everything for you the way that Mommy and sister do now? This sounds mean and I know it does. And it sucks your proposal got ruined. But it sounds like you aren't ready for all of that anyway",
            "Wow. No one should care about a ring that much. Are you sure she really wants to marry you? Maybe she just really wants to go wedding dress shopping.",
            "Your girlfriend's behaviour seems kind of understandable. She's wanted this proposal for a really long time, and it seems like she didn't see it coming until your sister spilled the beans, so that was a massively emotional moment for her. She likely wasn't thinking straight and was simply too excited. I expect she also got caught up in your sister's reaction, like 'oh, look, she's jumping for joy and screeching, I feel so happy too, I'm gonna get in on that!!'. I mean, look at it this way; if she had gotten pissed at your sister for ruining the surprise and demanded she leave, wouldn't that have created an awkward situation that ruined the proposal even more? I can definitely relate to your disappointment and it seems like you put some lovely effort into your initial plans, but, like the other commenters have said, you wanted to make her happy with a proposal, and you achieved that. \n\nHaving said that... I find it a bit ridiculous and worrying that you weren't able to salvage the evening at any point. It seems there may be communication issues between the two of you. Why she couldn't take the hint that you'd want to spend the night of your proposal with her alone is bizarre. And she shouldn't be just brushing off your concerns; this makes me worry that she's a little inconsiderate in the relationship. As her fianc\u00e9 your needs should be a priority for her. This type of thing is making me picture the clich\u00e9 bridezilla wedding on the horizon, where she doesn't let you have any involvement. Might be a bit of a leap, but I really don't see why she couldn't have just been a bit more considerate of you, especially after the initial excitement had worn off. As a result, I think the two of you need to communicate about this better. Make sure she knows exactly how you feel. Write a letter or maybe take her out for lunch with this specifically on the agenda, if you think she's brushing aside your feelings.\n\nAs for your sister... What she did was highly inappropriate, and man I would be so pissed if someone did that to me! It's just absolute common sense and basic social skills to know you don't interrupt another couple's proposal. It seems like she thinks the relationship directly includes her?? I mean, I get that she was excited that now her friend gets to be her sister in law, but she needs to be reminded your relationship isn't a threesome before she pulls this type of shit at the wedding too. Her behaviour is just plain ridiculous. How you react now is entirely dependent on how close you are to her, so I don't know what advice to give, other than not to let her get away with it Scott free. \n\nAnd as far as your mum's concerned... Tbh, it seems like she's by far the lesser of two evils. Like, yeah she should have reigned your sister in and butted out afterwards, but her behaviour is far less offensive than her daughter's, so I'd pick your battles here. And it seems she mostly stood on the sidelines and didn't try to steal control or make the situation about her, so I don't feel as worried about her future behaviour as I do about your sister's. ",
            "OP, sounds like no one respects you.  Including you.  Probably should look into that before getting married, else you'll back here in 10 years complaining about your marriage.",
            "OP, just a suggestion from an internet stranger: \n\n\n**Preamble**: Stop worrying about what went wrong. Instead, make the most of it. Your SO is obviously excited to start the next chapter with you. One aspect of adulting properly means having to learn how to deal with plans that don't work out. Obviously, your sister and mom were excited to have your GF join the family. Let the rest of it go. You're going to find that you have to be flexible and roll with it when things don't go according to plan (happens more often that you would think).   \n\nYou can still have the romantic moment that you wanted, you just need to be a little creative about it....\n\n**Step 1**: Order in some food. Something that she loves, that requires utensils, and not from a place that rhymes with wackonalds, turger ring, or paco krell.  \n\n**Step 2**: Eat dinner. Bring up the other night and apologize for freaking out. Explain to her that you had a plan, and that you were upset because your plan was thrown off by all the excitement and you wanted to have the perfect evening because SO is the perfect person for you. \n\n**Step 3**: Transition into a modified version of your speech. Tell her all the things you wanted to tell her the other night. During the speech, ask if you can hold the ring for just a moment, Add something to your comments about the ring, how its a promise and a symbol of your feelings for her. Look her in the eyes then say, \"you know, thinking about the other night, in all of the excitement I realize that I forgot something....a question, the most important question I'll ever ask\"\n\n**Step 4**: Get down on a knee, Hold out the ring for her. Try to smile (It's hard to smile feeling nervous) and look her in the eyes. \n\n**Step 5**: \"Will you marry me?\" \n\nShe'll, more than likely, think that it's sweet and thoughtful. It will also make a great story to tell one day. \n\nFinally, dude...learn how to cook. :) Take a class, watch the Food Network (or PBS if you don't have cable), and watch some YouTube videos. Lots of chefs have videos on how to cook signature dishes as well as basic getting started kind of stuff. Finally, try try try. Cooking is a creative skill, one that can be developed even as an adult. Start with simple and work your way up. It's like driving a car, except that you tried to go from just getting a learners permit to driving formula one in an afternoon.    She'll be more impressed that you took the time to learn than if you had popped out a skill all of a sudden. ",
            "This post is going to be full of \"tough love\" just a head's up. So you wanted to cook not just a meal but a \"very nice\" meal for your girlfriend and you expected to learn how in a matter of hours? Have you never paid any attention to how much effort really goes into cooking? If you were starting at the beginning you should have been learning for weeks if not months leading up to the proposal. \n\nAnd you should have gotten real cooking lessons. Just because someone can cook does not mean they can teach. Being a good cook is often synonymous with being a control freak which means it can be hard to let go and let someone else doing it particularly if we think they're doing it \"wrong\". \n\nSo in my opinion for that part your mom and sister get a pass because they didn't really do anything wrong. If your dinner had gone the way you had expected don't you think your girlfriend would have asked who taught you how to cook? And if the food hadn't tasted good they would have felt they held some of the responsibility for that.\n\nNow on to the rest of this, you need to learn to stand up to your family. I'll be honest I was shocked when I went back up and rechecked the age after I read the post. This does not read like a situation that a normal 24 year old would allow themselves to end up in. Why would you choose to propose in a place that required other people to leave in order to be alone and then not ask until the day of. \n\nAnd it sounds like you were the one that was far too caught up in how the engagement happened. Could it have gone better? Yes. Did your family overstep a bit? Yes. But obviously your girlfriend didn't care about a \"perfect\" proposal, you should be happy that you have someone who is so excited about getting married to you. And there are plenty of ways to give your speech that don't involve demanding a \"redo\" of the proposal like some people are suggesting. If the purpose of the proposal was truly to make her happy then you succeeded. \n\nAnd for all you know she didn't want them there either but knows they're your family and didn't want to start a fight with them because she knows how they are. She shouldn't have brushed your feelings aside but she was probably so happy that she just wanted to focus on that and she was tired from all the excitement. You are the one who needs to learn to put your foot down with them. And considering how long you've allowed them to baby you, that's going to be difficult. \n\nThis is not your girlfriend's fault, so you need to stop blaming her. Focus on the problems between you and your family because that's what needs to be changed. ",
            "Red flags all over this situation.  But I have to know, what did you cook and was it good??  Perhaps learning a dish prior, trying it out and then executing the proposal would be a good idea.  Also not telling anyone until you've proposed and she's accepted might be a better way to go.  Anyhow doesn't sound like you actually proposed so there is still time if you are sure you still want to marry her.",

            "Dude...you should move out and then propose. Even so, you're too young to get married if that's how everyone around you behaves.\n\nYou need to spend time on your own two feet, being independent and figuring out your life. And for gods sakes, learn to cook. ",
            "You getting married has nothing to do with you it has everything to do with your girlfriend, mom, and sister. They wanted to experience the moment together BC they've probably been talking about it forever. In your mom and sisters eyes they wouldn't have been able to bear not being there knowing it was about to happen. They didn't want to miss out on your GF reaction... You became insignificant because, again, it was all about them and experiencing the reaction together. Yeah it's shitty that they were selfish and didn't consider how that would make you feel, there emotions got the better of them. I hope they realize this and apologize to you.",
            "I think you might want to show this post to her, it could explain it better than you can face to face, and she might sympathize with the situation better. It was your proposal too. ",
            "I would like to offer another view. Although you felt the night was ruined your girlfriend certainly did not and from your description seemed to be very happy. \n\nFrom my limited experience with weddings and the aftermath it seems the ceremony stuff is for the women. I know that's not in all cases but in the majority of them I would say yes. I would also say most men enjoy the reception part and most of their input is focused there. \n\nMy point is OP will have plenty to do and enjoy in the coming months and shouldn't let the proposal that your girlfriend was excited about get him down ",

            "So many red flags here, don't even know where to start.",
            "I got married around your age. My SO and I had been together for ~3 years. We had both lived on our own (though at the time we got engaged I had temporarily moved home to save money) and were both pursuing graduate degrees.  We have been happily married for many years and I am glad we got married when we did. I am giving this brief history this to make it clear that I think age is a number (within reason), and that living with your parents as an adult doesn't bar you from being ready for marriage. It is life experience that determines if someone is ready to get married, and it is that department that seems to be lacking (based on the small glimpse of your life you give in your OP). \n\nIf you are seriously considering marriage you need to consider the following: \n\n* What are your long term goals in life?  (You don't mention anything about shared life goals, desire for children, career plans, etc.)\n* Do you make enough money to live on your own? (You live at home and do not give any indication as to why.)\n* Has your GF demonstrated such animalistic materialism before?  I get that \"the ring\" is hyped up, but that SHOULD NOT be the most important component of a proposal. This is a huge red flag and bodes ill for your wedding planning and future life if this is a trait that she has demonstrated before. \n* Do _YOU_ want to get married, or are you just getting married because that is what is expected of you?\n\nThese are just a few thoughts, but you are right to be worried about your GF's reaction to your proposal. If you decide to stay with her, be very clear with her what you felt was inappropriate about her reaction, and express to her your concerns.  Also, make sure the engagement is a long-ish one, because you really need to see how she behaves once she has you on the hook. ",
            "To be honest I don't think your mom did anything to ruin it, she just didn't try to stop it. Your sister is the one that ruined it. \n\nIt doesn't sound like you two are engaged, sounds like you just gave up the ring and let it be known that you were going to propose. \n\nNow if I were you I'd either make her wait an entire year to be able to propose to her the way you wanted to or propose to her at another time a bit closer in the future that she wouldn't expect. \n\nIt's your choice if you want to ask for the ring back or not, I probably wouldn't because it might freak her out but you could and just let her know that you really want to do it right and the way that it happened really hurt you and that its not the way you wanted it to be or the way you want to remember it.

Without the unnecessary distraction of the ring she might actually listen to your speech properly. \n\nIt's a great story. Don't be upset.

            "I'm really sorry that happened. However, I think a lot of other commenters are reading too far into your girlfriend's actions. She doesn't know what she missed out on when you sister spoiled the surprise. It sounds like she has wanted this for awhile and may have let her excitement get the best of her. I can't fault her for not wanting to spend time with you in bed afterwards with your family downstairs. That does sound pretty awkward to me. \n\nI think you have the right to feel hurt, but don't dwell on it. This is an exciting happy time for you and your girlfriend. I echo what a lot of other people have said. Take her somewhere alone and say \"My proposal didn't go how I wanted it to the other night, so I want to get it right.\" and then give your speech. I'm sure you girlfriend will appreciate it (and probably realize why you were so hurt initially). ",
            "People seem to be pretty hard on you here. I'll share a different perspective. \n \nSometimes, in life, things don't go the way we planned. It sucks. But sometimes, things get derailed, and we just have to live with it. \n \nYou love your girlfriend, and she loves you. THAT is what matters. That is really, all that matters. \n \nI had a shitty wedding day. I'd change everything about it if I could. But I can't. I just have to live life knowing tha tmy wedding was not the \"dream wedding\" every person hopes it can be. It makes me cringe to think of it, and I have some anger about some aspects of it. But - I love my husband, and THAT is what matters. Yeah, the wedding could have been better, but the end result is that I am married to the man who is perfect for me, and that's all that matters. \n \nSo you learned a lesson. You learned not to trust your sister and mother with JACK SHIT. (And I'll tell you this - do not tell them if your gf gets pregnant until the baby is a few hours old. Don't tell them a damned thing. Don't tell them anything you wouldn't want to see on the front page of the news the next day. LEARN FROM THIS.)  \n \nYou also learned that maybe, for something as big as a proposal, you could put a little more planning into things. (But mostly, leave your fucking mother and sister OUT OF IT.) \n \nYour girlfriend is thrilled. She loves you, and wants to be married to you and that is what matters. You love her, and want to be married to her, and that is what matters. \n \nTell your gf that you're upset at how it all went down, but then let it go.  \n \nAs for your sister, you learned your lesson. You can't trust her. Now you know. Tell her that you are furious and disappointed, that you no longer trust her, and that this has affected your closeness with her. She ruined your proposal and that's that. If you tell her anything after this, that's on YOU. ",
            "RED\nFLAGS.\n\nThis clearly isn't about you, its about the event, and you should be very concerned about what this means for your future. Time for you to take a two week vacation alone to \"think about things.\" She should be excited about marrying YOU, not just \"getting married\". If you're a spectator to your own proposal, you might want to rethink the whole thing. Consider the cost of the ring an expensive lesson and tell her you're not officially engaged because you never officially proposed. Then think long and hard about whether you want to even continue the relationship. Also, move away from home for god's sake.",

            "Oh my god, I really feel for you. I am a girl but I would've felt the same way if I were you. And if I were your GF I would've been really angry and annoyed that your sister ruined my surprise proposal. It's meant to be a private moment goddammit!!\n\nBut on the upside, your mother, sister and fianc\u00e9 seems close, so that's a bonus.\n\nHowever I have a feeling this isn't a isolated incident. You have to learn to establish better boundaries and perhaps learn to assert yourself better when dealing with them. They seem like the typical girl gang when they get together and dominate you a bit, you have to be really stern with them and assert and re-assert yourself to really drill into their heads that \"THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME, DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT, DO 1, 2 and 3. IF YOU DO, I WILL BE VERY UPSET.\"\n\nI'd suggest you to plan something else special for your girlfriend, so you get to have that special private moment back where you get to say everything you wanted to say then. And make sure you make it known to her that you are feeling bulldozed by the situation and tell her you wished she could appreciate your effort more, as its your moment too. I'm sure she will understand and be super accepting as you just, ahem, proposed!!\n\nNever let resentment build!! Always communicate!! I wish you the best of luck!! Your gf sounds she's honestly just happy to be engaged to you and you sound like you'll make a really thoughtful partner :)",

Now while I'm sure that's true for some people, it's not a fact and you're clearly unhappy. If she doesn't care as your gf/pseudo-fianc\u00e9e, she won't care as your wife. ",

            " To me, it seems like they all cared more about the ring than the actual engagement itself. Your girlfriend seems like she only wanted to be engaged simply for the sake of saying \"Look I'm engaged\" and then flashing her ring around, and not at all because she wanted to actually be married to you. You have every right to be upset by this, your sister, and mother to some extent, and your girlfriend showed you 0 respect that night. \n\n You really need to sit her down and let her know exactly how she made you feel. Tell her everything you just told us, hell just show her the post if you have to. It sounds to me like you two aren't ready to be married yet. You may think you're ready, but judging by her behaviour you most definitely are not. She sounds super immature and selfish.\n\n Take back the engagement ring and talk to your girlfriend. Tell her you aren't engaged because you didn't actually get the chance to ask the question. Technically, you're not engaged until you actually ask her to marry you.\n\n Also the next time you have a big surprise planned for anyone for any reason, don't tell anyone. Especially not your sister.",
            "Your sister and girlfriend both responded really immaturely.... But its your girlfriend who I'd worry about the most. Do you want to marry a school-girl or a woman? She needs to grow up...\n\nI agree with what someone else said; take the ring back and say you're not engaged until you've had the chance to actually propose. Before you propose again tell her that under no circumstances was what happened okay, and though it wasn't her *fault*, the fact that she continued on with their behavior, cared more about the ring than about you, defended them, tried to be with them over you, then told you \"I'm too tired tell me tomorrow\" and those are all unacceptable to you.\n\nI would **seriously** reconsider this engagement, and tbh, your relationship as a whole. Does she love you? Or does she just want a ring? To me it just seems like she's too immature to be married, but at the same time, she doesn't seem to be mature enough for a long-term relationship whatsoever with how she completely ignored your feelings, then steamrolled over them.",
            "Your sister acted badly, yes. Your girlfriend was so excited in the moment that she let your sister hijack the evening. But you wanted it to be all about you, and \"your perfect proposal\" and it didn't go that way. Lots of things in life are going to end up not being about you, even when they should be, and you'll have to either accept that life is like that or get used to sulking. \n\nGet over it. You proposed to a girl who was so excited to be getting married to you that she didn't care how the proposal went. Your sister clearly loves your girlfriend, and while she may be a bit of an attention seeking drama llama, she wasn't trying to be mean, she was just immature.\n\nOr make a big deal about it. It's your life, live it how you want.",
            "This is going to disagree with most of the posters, but whatever. You think the proposal was ruined, but your gf doesn't. She sounds completely ecstatic. I know you wanted everything to be perfect, and you put a lot of time and thought into it, but life doesn't always go according to plan. Your gf didn't get the pitch perfect proposal you were planning, but she's happy and excited anyways. It sucks, and your sister kinda sucks for not being able to keep her mouth shut, but everyone got swept up in the moment and carried away and I think that's pretty human. Hopefully, this will be a funny story to tell later.",
            "The perfect proposal is one that ends with a loving marriage. Yes, your sister was obnoxious and in the wrong, but maybe you should consider how well your sister and fianc\u00e9e seem to get along, and how happy you've made your future wife.\n\nWasn't the whole point of the evening to make your fianc\u00e9e feel special? And she did, even though it didn't go according to your plan?",
            "The way your girlfriend completely ignored your feelings is really really **concerning**. \n\nWhile your sister is completely in the wrong and will hopefully apologise, I think that she didn't act out of malice: she was genuinely happy for you and was so impatient to see how happy your gf would have been (hence saying to hurry up), that she really hijacked the proposal. This is not a justification, it's just to make you understand her actions.\n\nYour girlfriend on the other hand should really have empathised with you; the proposal is about *you two*. How could she care only about the ring? Her extreme politeness trying not to make things awkward overrode her feelings for you.\n\nI completely agree on the fact that no proposal was made. You didn't even give her the ring, Jesus Christ, they took it from your hands! Get the ring back, live together for at least 6 months and see how it goes. ",
            "I'm 22 and I've always looked forward to the moment I can propose to some woman who I truly feel is right for it. Reading this destroyed me. I legit teared up because, in your place, I would have so much trouble getting over it.\n\nIt is IMPERATIVE to get heard and feel as though you are understood. I'm not saying to break up, but definitely to stand your ground. This is marriage. If getting engaged is so important, so is being heard and understood by the person you taking that step with.\n\nLikewise, understand she's been waiting on this for a long time. Marriage is a happy medium. Your girlfriend has no fault in what your family did. Also, at least your family gets along so well! I think if you really love her you should stand your ground and make sure you feel understood, as well as letting her feel you also understand her and don't blame her. Get a second chance. Have a real proposal your way. \n\nMarriage is compromise.",
            "Couple things here.\n\n1) No offense but that was piss poor planning and far from the \"perfect\" or \"magical\" proposal.  If it works for you and your GF that's fantastic...but you really didn't do much planning other than pick up a ring and have a night at home.  You didn't even go so far as to learn to cook before hand...you just asked your mom and sister the day of.  Grow up dude...move out.  \n\n2) Ok enough bashing on you.  You really should have a sit down with your GF and talk about how you didn't appreciate the steam rolling and how you felt like just an accessory at your own proposal...and what you both can do to improve / remedy the situation.  Take a trip? do something special? or what.\n\n3) Sit down with your mother and tell her you are not a child anymore and that you will take ownership of your own life...and actually do it.  Cook for yourself, do your own laundry, move out for god sakes.\n\n4) Sit down with your sister.  You need to be firm here, and in no uncertain terms tell her that she ruined your proposal.  She may think of you as a child, or not mature...but in that moment, she ruined what was supposed to be a special event in the life of you and your soon to be fiancee and not only did she take it away from you, she completely ruined the memory of it for you.\n\nThere's plenty of \"blame\" to go around, but do remember it is still a happy time.\n",
            "Your sister is a moron and your girlfriend is not mature enough for marriage. What kind of person would rather spend their engagement night oohing and aahing over a ring with their bf's sister and mom than spend it with their new fianc\u00e9? She cares more about having a ring to show off to her friends than making a comittment to you. And seriously, your sister needs to get a life of her own. This isn't her engagement and she should not have been involved in you proposing at all. She took the whole night away from you and made it all about her. ",
            "I feel so bad for you. If it makes you feel better my BF is talking about proposing to me in Micro Center so I will be so happy he finally proposed after years of waiting that I won't care if he buys some expensive, fancy graphics card. He also has the ring we picked out still sitting in the shipping box for the past few days sitting by the stairs to mess with me (not in a mean or dick head way).  Jokes on him because I don't care where he proposes and I wouldn't give a shit if he bought an expensive graphics card because it's his money. ;)\n\nNow you know in the future if you have big news to leave your sister out of it. Congrats by the way!\n\nYou really need to sit your GF down and talk about how you feel so it doesn't breed resentment. It always helps tell if she really cares about your feelings or just wants a ring and a wedding. Work on the communication before you have the wedding. ",
            "I feel like people have covered everything in terms of drawing up boundaries with your Mum/sister, not trying to learn to cook a fancy meal on the day of the proposal, making sure your fiance is motivated by wanting marriage and not a proposal etc so I'm not going to go over that stuff with you.\n\nThat said, why not redo the proposal? If you still want to marry her (and it sounds like you do) talk to your Mum, tell her you need to do it properly and ask her to help with *getting your sister out of the house before your girlfriend even shows up and keeping her there*. Then, cook a nice meal (the nice folks at /r/food and /r/cooking could help you with picking something delicious and relatively stress-free, that way no one will highjack). Get a bunch of candles or something else to set the atmosphere and when your girlfriend walks in, playfully say something along the lines of \"let's try this again\" and do your speech. You can always pause and go \"I need to borrow your ring for the next bit\" to put it back on her finger. \n\nYour girlfriend probably isn't that bothered because being proposed to, regardless of the circumstances, feels romantic to her. It wasn't for you because you offered up the commitment and then felt ignored as a result of your sister's hijacking. If you need the romantic moment (and it sounds like you do), recreate it. \n\nAlso, talk to your sister afterwards and tell her that it will be *your. wedding.* and if she does anything to sideline you again you will pull a groomzilla put her in the most puffy, hideous bridesmaid's dress you can possibly find. Deliver as a joke but give her very serious eyes as you do so and keep the mike away from her on the day.",
            "Jesus man, I'm so sorry. I know you're getting ripped to shreds on some stuff, but regardless, what happened was completely unacceptable on your mom and sister's parts. I haven't actually groaned out loud so many times while reading a /r/relationships post in a long time. I mean, they really fucked things up for you, I'm so sorry. They really should've held it together and gotten the fuck out. ",
            "[deleted]",
            "Sorry OP, but your post is just filled with red flags. This botched proposal may be the least of your problems. \n  \nAs a young woman who is your gf's age and has been living independently for several years now, if I were your girlfriend, I would be very cautious to become engaged and commit to marriage with someone who is not independent and has his priorities mixed. With the money you used to buy a ring,#1 priority should have been becoming more independent and finding a place of your own (even if you have to share it with roommates, or, better yet, your girlfriend). \n  \nYou seem a bit immature based on the fact that you seem a little too reliable on your family. Living with them doesn't bother me since I understand that staying with your family can cut costs of living down. Unfortunately, you don't know how to cook and you had to be taught by your mom and sister as such an old age. They called you a child which means they also think you're immature.\n  \nBased on her reaction and not really understanding your feelings, your girlfriend also doesn't sound mature enough to be married. If she is in a similar situation to you and lives and relies on her family, becoming engaged should not be something she should rush into.\n  \nMaybe you should take this failed proposal as a blessing and use it to your advantage. Do something more beneficial to you and your girlfriend's relationship: try being independent and live together before becoming engaged.",
            "Redo the proposal. 200km or more radius recommended away from your family. I don't know why it's that specific number just get away from your mom and sister while you do it. I was getting so angry reading what they did at the door. I would have not proposed and lied to the sister that your gf said no just to see her cry. ",
            "OP, show her this post.",
            "I feel like any comment I have about this would just be echoing your own feelings, so I'll skip that. Let me recommend to you one thing: if you're proceeding with the wedding, however it goes down, do not let them hijack that part of it. Your girlfriend will thank you later, too. Remind your sister and mother that this is not their wedding, it's yours and your girlfriend's. Period. Otherwise, based on this tacky display, you can only imagine how much worse they will fuck up your wedding planning and the event itself. You don't want that, and you don't deserve it. It'll be a part of the entire memory of it forever. \n\nMy ex husband and I had an awesome wedding, and part of that was because we cut out his mother more than she wanted. We found ourselves hearing things like \"this isn't just about you\" - when in fact, it was literally only about us because it was OUR WEDDING. We took a stand and pointed out that she had her own damn wedding already and this was our turn. We managed to retain control over the proceedings and when it happened, it was the way we wanted it. \n\nYou have every reason to be pissed off, and your sister deserves a serious one-on-one dressing down. But now that you know what to expect, don't let this happen on a bigger scale with the wedding itself.\n\nI do think you should also have a conversation with your girlfriend, although a much gentler one since this isn't her fault, although she didn't do anything to slow the roll when it started happening. She did overlook your obvious hurt feelings and not even allow you to actually propose to her, and you don't want any amount of bad blood about that to sit and fester at the beginning of the next stage of your lives together. I'm sure if she's reasonable she'll understand and you guys can move past it. \n\nFinally, I second another poster's idea for redoing it at another time as a surprise and keeping it private as fuck. That way you have an unspoiled memory and you never did actually get to ask her. \n\nEdit: a word.",

            "Well your sister is Michael Scott..the way you describe her, how did you not see this coming from miles away?\n\nIm sorry about this and good luck",
            "I think you should cut your girlfriend some more slack. According to you, she has been patiently waiting for you to propose for a long time but you personally did not think the time was right in your life. For a very long time, you got things the way you wanted to and she did not. On the night you finally proposed to you, she got very caught up in all the excitement and forgot about your feelings (and notably your torn clothes). On a normal date night, I would say she was being selfish and uncompromising. If we factor in an evening that she had to wait for for very long time because you had brushed off her wishes of having a wedding sooner (unless there were very, very extreme circumstances that you decided to wait), I would say that perhaps you are brushing off her feelings.\n\nIf you are concerned that you still will have lingering harsh feelings against your girlfriend, I recommend saying, \"I am sorry I blamed you for dismissing my feelings. When I am sitting on the couch with my clothes torn up and get ignored, I feel invisible. But I can also understand why you did that. I brushed off your desire to have a wedding much earlier.\"\n\nAs for the mom and the sister, I think you should also cut them some slack. You begged them to do a huge, stressful task for you and told them to keep a really, really big secret just a few hours before your girlfriend came over. I would recommend structuring future conversations with the mom and the sister about this in the same way I suggested you talk to your girlfriend about the evening.\n\nI think you should cut yourself some slack. You have a mom, sister, and girlfriend who are really happy for you. You have a strong enough relationship with all of them that they are really excited to become one family together. Yes, your evening went poorly and it didn't go as planned, but you're going to have a beautiful life going forward and it is because you surround yourself with love.\n\nTL;DR Things don't always go as planned. There is more than one way to look at this. Cut everyone some slack, including yourself.",

            "Dude. Move out, and try living with someone before you propose.\n\n1) Both parties having lived by themselves for a while will help eliminate issues, such as one person doing all the chores, or both being dependent on eachother, because they can't figure out stuff by themselves. She will need you to do her laundry, and you need someone to feed you.\n\n2) Living together before getting married will make you see if you can even stand living together.

            "The fact that your GF was freaking out that much over the ring, ignoring you and not wanting to hear what you had to say when she's supposed to be engaged to you and not a piece of jewelry speaks volumes. \n\nThe maturity is missing here on multiple levels.

It wasn't about you, it was about her, right?  \n\nIf it didn't go according to plan but the intended recipient was happy, don't be grumpy about it.  There will be a lot of things that happen in your life that don't go according to plan.  Enjoy the surprises.\n\nETA:  Given how many posts here are about how a proposal was unacceptable to the recipient for stupid reasons, I think you're focusing too much on the proposal being perfect rather than the woman you want to marry being the right one.

            "Agree with ShelfLifeInc, you're going to have more problems other than this.  Fortunately, you're young and it seems like you and your girlfriend have grown together.  I would definitely not take the ring back unless you're a little more certain that this isn't going to work.  Don't know how that got upvoted...  \n\nSeems like you were most upset that you were ignored during the whole process, which was supposed to be about you and your girlfriend.  If you want a redo, you can take her to a nice restaurant or the place you first met and do it again.  Then get a hotel and stay there for the night.  ",

If the proposal didn't go exactly as planned then you'll likely laugh about this years from now.\n\nMy advice:  Smile, laugh and if you haven't already done so ask your love to be your wife.

If you don't I am betting on you having a miserable marriage where they co-operate in walking all over you if you don't. Please imagine this being the rest of your life. Do you want that?\n\nThink carefully about what you gnat from them, from life and then confront them.\n\nYour fiancee first: She behaved very badly. Your engagement is about both of you but ditched you for your sister and the ring. That's disgusting and makes me wonder if she wants a wedding and a rock and new sister rather than a husband. It should have been obvious to her that you were being pushed aside and this wasn't what you planned or wanted. **She has shown a shocking disregard for your feelings and wishes and effort**. You need think carefully about what you want from her before you talk. You should go into the conversation ready to take the ring back but be aware if you do you probably won't get to propose a second time. You also need to let her know now that your sister is not invited to the wedding until you get an apology you are happy with.\n\nYour sister meanwhile behaved fucking terribly. This \"Never speak to you again\" territory and I wouldn't blame you for never forgiving her. This is like if she tried to or did have sex with your fiancee. This is like if you got the phone-call to go to the hospital because your baby was being born but your sister rushed out and took your car and left without you. This is like running up in the middle of your vows, shouting \"YOLO\" and throwing a bucket of shit on you. Confront her and don't be afraid to scream and curse if you need to or want to. She richly deserves it and you shouldn't have anything further to do with her until you get an apology. Personally I don't think I could forgive her. This was a once in a lifetime event that got ruined despite her knowing how much it meant to you.\n\nHonestly you were too damn passive. Next time make yourself heard, make a scene or just flat out get up and leave. Scream or cry or just walk out and go no contact fr a few days since apparently they don't want to hear you. If people want something from you they should give something too. You need to really consider why you proposed to your fiancee and if she really loves you at all.\n\nTL;DR: Stand up for yourself, confront them separately and get a result you are satisfied with. Don't be afraid to take back the ring or cut off your sister. Or get treated badly the rest of your life.",

            "This will probably be buried but I really hope you see it. \n\nI'm sure you have gotten a lot of Red Pillish messages about manning up and nutting up and being emasculated, etc. Look, ignore that noise. This is a problem of overcontrol, and both genders suffer from it. \n\nYour mother and your sister do not respect you. \n\nTheir actions the entire day make this painfully obvious. They call you a child. They emphasize your incompetence. They are hell bent on taking your agency away at every possible moment. \n\nThis must have been a message they have given you your entire life. You are stupid. You are a child. You can't do it right. You'll just screw it up like you do everything. Here, let me do that for you, etc. Sound familiar? \n\nI received that message when I was a child (I am female, FWIW). My father had received that message. It is very insidious because it is cloaked in the disguise of love and caring. \n\nIt is not love and caring; it is other people feeding their own egos at your expense. It is like a kind of abuse with a cute candy colored sugar coating. \n\nYou need, like you need air and water, to get away from these people and spend some time establishing your own identity and doing things for yourself. \n\nYour family will not like it. Too bad. Get out. Do not pass Go, do not discuss this with them. Your life is at stake. \n\nYou are 24 and presumably had the money to buy this ring, so I assume you have a job. Clearly you also know how to make plans. You can do this. \n\nStep 1. Get out of your house. Now. Do not move in with your girlfriend. Get your own apartment with just yourself or with roommates. Do it now. Get off Reddit, find a place, and move in. \n\nKeep this arrangement a secret. When you are ready to move in, hire a truck and a couple of people if necessary to get it done as fast as possible. When you are asked what you are doing, say you are moving out. Then put your headphones back on and get the job done without discussion. \n\nThey will blow up your phone. Ignore it. Answer it once you have settled in, and then only if you feel like it. \n\nThey not have positive message for you. They will have 100 reasons why you are stupid and you will fail. \n\nYou have no obligation to listen to negative messages about yourself, even if they are family. The instant they start in about how you are stupid and wrong and you can't do this, etc., hang up and don't answer. \n\nIf you really want to, write them a short, simple email saying that you are angry about how they behaved with your proposal because they consistently and repeatedly ignored what you wanted and dismissed your feelings. You will now be living on your own and you will be happy to continue to have a relationship with them as long as they listen to and respect your wants and feelings without judgment or put-downs. \n\nYou are not obliged to have a relationship with people who disrespect you and put you down, \"faaaaaaamily!!\" notwithstanding. Henceforth, any time they ignore your wishes or put you down, you will hang up or physically leave their presence, immediately, every time. \n\nEither they will adapt and change their ways, or they will insist that they are right and you are stupid, incompetent, spoiled, selfish, etc. They may make some dramatic manipulations. One or both of them may feign an illness. They may even escalate their behavior to outright abuse. How they respond will say a lot about how much they actually love you. \n\nOk, on to Step 2. Now you are managing your relationship with your family of origin like a champ. The next problem is that they deprived you of survival skills. Now you have to learn all this shit on your own. \n\nNone of it is rocket surgery. Google is your friend. Go ahead and experiment with all of it: how to sweep, get soap scum off a bathtub (still working on that one myself), how to clean a toilet, how to do laundry, how to iron, and of course, how to cook. \n\nYou will fuck it up a lot at first. That's ok. It doesnt mean that you are a child, or stupid, or any such thing. It means that that's how people learn. \n\nStep 3. If you have spent your entire life being belittled by these women, you are at risk of getting into a relationship which is more of the same. As you get used to being independent and setting limits with your mother and sister, examine the dynamic you have with your fianc\u00e9e carefully. Does she tell you what to do? Does she accept your opinion, or does she invalidate it reflexively? Does she ever give you the same kinds of put-downs as your family, or is she flexible and open to compromise? Can you name a time when she went along with something you wanted just because you wanted it, without judgment? Do both of you feel free to express your feelings or wants to the other without being belittled, dismissed, or invalidated? \n\nYou may need some help from a therapist with one or more of these steps. \n\nPush on. This obnoxious incident may end up saving your life. ",

Yes, your sister sounds like she went way over board, but I have a feeling maybe she's a highly emotional person. Since you've presumably lived with her all your life, I would say you had a slightly unrealistic outlook on what the reaction from them would be. You could have planned a proposal away from your mom's house, a picnic you fixed the food for would have worked, therefore taking extra people out of the equation if you really wanted it to be just the two of you. Typically, if you don't want family involved in a proposal, don't do it at their house! "

The friendship slowly started to fade and we got coffee about 6 months after my post and she spent the entire time talking about herself and life and barely asked me anything about mine. Like of a 2 hour coffee, I maybe spoke for 10 minutes max. I was happy to let the friendship fade because of some other shitty behaviour from her but finally she confronted me over Facebook about it all and I decided to tell her I just didn't want to be friends anymore and I wished her all the best. I felt pretty bad, as it wasn't the nicest thing but I genuinely wasn't keen on staying her friend and was hoping she'd take the hint and just let it fade, and at least she has that closure of me formally ending the friendship? idk. Based on her social, looks like she has lots of great friends now and things are going well for her, which is great. She's a fun person, just not a fit for me I think. \n\nThe D&D campaign went amazingly, my character actually ended up dying and then being resurrected by a different god in order to kill the big bad guy - and my character ending up dealing the finishing blow. We just started a new campaign that M is DMing this time and it's super fun so far. \n\nIn other news, M actually proposed to me a few weeks ago and we just bought a house together. So things are great! And while I don't have tons of friends, the ones I do have are way more fun to play board games and D&D with and I'm making a big effort in 2020 to make more friends. \n\nWanted to thank everyone who gave me the advice on the first thread - particularly the person who gave me their permission to lie haha.  \n\nTL;DR: Formally ended the friendship with my friend after more crappy behaviour from her, which was a little awkward and am now engaged to my BF from the original post and obsessed with D&D!",

            "I've known two people that sound like your friend. \n\nThey were very self-involved people which had strong elements of narcissism in them. They spend all their time talking about themselves and include you only when it align with what they want. One in particular spoke in such a way that it really didn't matter who was on the other side listening. It felt like it could've been one of those bobbing head figurines and it wouldn't make a difference! So it's a good idea to cut such selfishness out of your life.\n\nAlso, don't feel too bad for them. Their narcissism means that everything is going swimmingly for them (or so they tell themselves) and therefore, insofar as it matters to both your side and hers, it is. They're at least happy in their own bubble and perhaps we should even envy them that! :)",

            "I had a friendship like this, except that the friendship had lasted for 5 years. We were long distance friends; lived on opposite sides of the country, so we didn\u2019t see each other much. I had her over for NYE last year, from Friday to Thursday. I had just gotten engaged that November so i was excited for her to meet my fianc\u00e9. He was really excited too, as he knew i had considered her one of my best friends, he had shown her my engagement ring when he bought it, they had talked on the phone a little about him proposing etc. Well when she got here, all she did was freaking complain. She acted distant, wanted to go to all of these fancy restaurants, cities, fitness classes, etc. I had made plans for us before the trip because she always just said \u201cit\u2019s up to you\u201d but clearly it really wasn\u2019t. I paid over $700 in less than a week as a broke law student to accommodate her and make her feel like we were \u201cdoing things.\u201d And she was super rude to my fianc\u00e9. Anyway, sorry for my rambling, but my point is don\u2019t feel bad about cutting off toxic friendships. My fianc\u00e9 encouraged me to confront her about her behavior and when i did she just said \u201cwell we didn\u2019t really do much.\u201d As in when she was here. I can\u2019t imagine seeing one of my best friends who i never see, in the middle of the winter, in a seasonal resort beach town, who took me to a big city to shop, got them a gym membership, took them to a bunch of fun girly friend things, and a casino club for NYE, and then say that. So yeah, don\u2019t feel bad about cutting off self absorbed, toxic \u201cfriends\u201d!",

Yes, OP needed to cut this person out of her life but the fact that this makes the front page of the sub instead of just being an update most people shrug their shoulders at is pretty gross. It's like all this sub can do anymore is cheer people on as they end all sorts of relationships, even the familial ones.\n\nBe really careful about asking for advice here because a lot of the people here seem to take delight in people cutting people off. In fact if you want advice about familial relationships I would avoid this place like the plague because everyone thinks they are marrying into a JustNoMIL or that any disagreement they have with their parents, no matter how big or small it is, means they were raisedbynarcissists .",
            "Why are you looking at her social accounts? If you terminated the relationship (don't take piss pore behavior from anyone, standing up for you is most definitely the correct choice) and you should delete the Insta/TickToc/Facebook/Twitter (ECT) There is zero reason to keep the social connection. She doesn't need to see, be able to judge, comment on your life, nothing positive can come from that. You scrolling her page after you terminated the relationship isn't healthy choice."

            "I've been in relationships with guys like this and I've been the guy like this (not for anxiety reasons, but similar enough), and as a stopgap in the moment, I really recommend agreeing on silence. As in, when he's feeling anxious there's a signal that says we're going to be silent and just hold each other for a bit. No words, no endless tiring comfort, just a moment of silence that always means 'you've done nothing wrong, let's sit through this'. This won't fix anything but it's a strategy in the moment. ",
            "So, anxiety actually gets *worse* the more you feed it; when you jump in to reassure his anxious feelings away (and when your BF asks/lets you do so), your BF never gets the chance to actually process them himself, and strengthen his coping mechanisms. Like a muscle that atrophies without use, the more he turns to external 'fixes' (you), the less he'll be able to function by himself. This is, of course, hard to balance, because you do want him to be able to discuss things and bring up concerns with you.\n\nLuckily, your BF has a professional to consult! Have your boyfriend ask his therapist for suggestions on ways to handle his post-coital anxiety spikes, and how best you can support him. (Note that your best support might not actually be reassurance!)\n\nIn the meantime, see if you can cut off these anxiety spirals at their source by saying gently \"Are you concerned about X because you've noticed a pattern, or was this just a one-off event that's worrying you? Can we revisit this concern if it becomes a pattern?\" \"BF I am happy to periodically reiterate that I had a great time and am happy with the relationship, but this thing where I have to repeatedly reassure you *in the same conversation* kinda feels like you don't believe me when I say these things. It stings to be asked to reassure you of my \\[love for you/care for you/happiness with relationships\\], only to be indirectly called a liar. I'm 95% sure it's just the anxiety talking and you don't actually believe this, but from now on I'm going to start saying these things only once per conversation. Can you talk to your therapist about ways to try to cut off this spiral as it begins? If they have any suggestions for me to help you, I'd love to hear them.\" \"Do you really believe that, or is that the anxiety talking?\" (This last one, use carefully - it's intended to be a gentle reality check, but it *can* come across as invalidating of actual feelings.)",
            "He needs to know that this\n\n> having to lay there and comfort him 3/4 times we\u2019re in bed \n\ncannot possibly be comfortable or fun for *anybody*.\n\nAnxiety is not a death sentence for normalcy or happiness. It can be managed. A large part of that management is consideration for others. It isn't nice to make your anxiety someone else's problem. It isn't kind to make them care for you in what could be a vulnerable moment for them. Sounds like Charlie needs more awareness of how his actions are affecting you. \n\nTell him how this specific behavior makes *you* feel. ",
            "I would slow things down for awhile. It sounds like he\u2019s getting overwhelmed with the thoughts racing through his head, so simple intimacy might be what he needs to process things a little at a time. Do you ever give each other massages? Or try meditating together. It sounds silly, but it might help him more easily center himself with you in close proximity. Don\u2019t feel like the burden is on you to \u201cfix\u201d this. So long as he knows he can talk to you, that\u2019s what is most important. ",
            ">He can\u2019t help mental illness. \n\nNope but he can treat it. His regular therapist isn't working if this is what is happening on a regular basis. It just as an unfun experience for him as it is for you so whhhhhbyyyyyy hasn't he done something? Meds, a new therapist, and possibly an additional therapist that specializes in sex. This could be more than anxiety too: low self worth, insecurity, baggage from previous experiences, etc. \n\nJust tell him. Yeah, it will suck and he may spiral a little. If he starts going off on how you'll leave him, don't reassure him. Its tempting, I know, but it doesn't help. Let him go on for a while without saying anything and when you can: \"did I say i was going to leave you?\" He may flounder about how it will eventually lead to that but ask your question again until ue simmers down. Then frame it as \"this bothers both of us, what are your next (medical) options to treat this\" and make it clear this current course of action no longer works ",
            "Be frank but loving. Tell him his anxiety is pushing the buttons that otherwise are not a problem and you can't go through this routine every time you're intimate. But ensure he knows it's coming from a place of love and acceptance. ",
            "> I came out late. Charlie was my first everything.\n\nThis may be clouding your better judgement on this one. All signs point to Charlie absolutely not being ready for a relationship or quite frankly much intimacy. He has some individual work to do with his diagnosis and it's probably best if you let go of this relationship in the meantime. ",
            "> and things really are pretty good.\n\nWhat you write is so poor, i can't imagine how good everything else would be to make me suffer through it.\n\nHe's not making any efforts to fix it, he's making you feed into it. This is why it's getting worse rather than better. \n\nYou can't fix this. If he's not making moves to fix it, don't waste your time trying to fix it for him.\n\nThe only thing that's going to happen here is that you will end up with relationships and sex ruined for you.",
            "This does not sound healthy for either of you",
            "There\u2019s so much to unpack here. First, it\u2019s wonderful that he is seeing someone professionally so he can tackle this issue head-on. His anxiety isn\u2019t your problem. Personally, it also sounds like he\u2019s making your orgasms about him, which is kind of manipulative in itself, which he may not realize. \nI\u2019m sorry that I don\u2019t have the best advice for you on this one, but watch these flags. ",
            "I have kind of a different solution I\u2019d like to suggest.  I\u2019m a married gay dude and I sometimes get anxious during sex to the point where I can\u2019t sustain an erection.  What triggers it in me is if I get distracted.  If I hear a noise outside the window or the dog playing with a toy or the tv is on, it takes my mind off of how much I\u2019m enjoying the sex.  Then I start worrying that since I\u2019m not thinking about the sex, I won\u2019t be able to keep it up, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nI don\u2019t know if distraction is playing a part in your boyfriend\u2019s issues, but if it is, you can try some of the things that work for us.  One is sometimes he surprises me with sex right when I wake up.  My sleepy brain hasn\u2019t had time to fill with all of my worries and I can just enjoy the sex with a blank slate.  \n\nAnother one we discovered by accident is for us to have sex while I\u2019m wearing ear plugs.  I find I pay more attention to how his body feels, how his breathing changes, and I don\u2019t get distracted by noises or start worrying if the neighbours can hear us.  Earplugs plus blindfold is even better and takes it someplace kinky.\n\nA third thing you can try is a change of environment, like going away for the weekend.  Being in a new place lets me forget about all the failed attempts in your normal bedroom.  \n\nWe had a period a few years ago where I was having trouble every time we attempted for a few months, but once we had a few times in a row without issues, I got my confidence back and stopped worrying about it so much.  I still have an issue once or twice a year, but then we try one of the above strategies and I can leave it behind me. Good luck to you both, he\u2019s lucky to have someone compassionate like you to help him through this.",
            "Tbh OP, this does not sound like a guy who is ready for a serious intimate relationship OP. How long can you handle this before you end up resenting this guy?",
            "You're really reinforcing his negative behaviour by spending so much time comforting him. It's actually enabling it. He can't help the *thoughts* that crop up, but he *can* help how he chooses to respond. Can you go in with him to a few therapy sessions and get some support/advice on how best to handle things on your end? You're sacrificing your happiness for his comfort, and that's not fair. That's what people call co-dependent. I don't mean that as a judgement, and I know you're trying to be a loving and supportive partner. Part of that means setting limits and taking care of you and your needs, too. And he also needs to reciprocate and support you. ",
            "Other commenters have given plenty of excellent advice on how to talk to him about bringing this up in therapy, how to set boundaries so you're being supportive but not enabling, etc., so I'm going to skip to a practical suggestion. This, obviously, you should definitely only enact if you feel your concerns are being heard and addressed in terms of him understanding why you're upset and trying to form better coping mechanisms and so on. \n\nIt's clear that he feels personally responsible for the quality of your mutual sex life, in a unidirectional way; his anxiety seems to be stemming from the framing he has in his mind where he provides sex and you receive sex and therefore he only deserves all the nice things about your relationship that you give him that he values if he successfully provides sufficiently good sex. So one potential way to address this would be for you to take on a more active or \"dominant\" role in the bedroom, such that that becomes more *your* responsibility, and he can hopefully relax and focus on enjoying the moment and maybe find something less stressful to hang his Good Boyfriend hat on, like finding you books you like or something. (I find this works pretty well on my husband - he gets much more anxious and self-conscious about his performance when he's the one taking actions than when he's the one having sex done \"to\" him, so to speak, but he doesn't have this problem with cooking.) ",
            "I dunno, I mean... I don\u2019t think I would be sticking around. I don\u2019t want to sound like an asshole, but this isn\u2019t something you can fix, and it isn\u2019t something you have to take on as a partner. ",
            "That sounds like it would be quite exhausting for you. I just wanted to put a quick note in about behavioural reinforcement. You may be completely unconsciously and lovingly reinforcing his behaviour. Think about it - when he expresses his anxiety in a certain way, you 'reward' him by giving him lots of attention and love. I'm not saying ignore him, but a simple acknowledgment of the fact that it sucks, and then getting on with things, is less likely to reward future prolonged expressions on his part. \n\nI know it sounds a little harsh, but it's really not. In the long run, you can help shorten his responses. His initial anxious response might be fair, but then it may keep circulating because he's getting positive reinforcement for continuing it longer. \n\nGood luck! Also, it helped for me to ask my therapist what my partner should be doing to help.",

            "It's not your job to convince him he's doing a good job. That's his job, to do a good job.

This is not something you want to deal with for 40+ years.",
            "You say \u201cits my job to lay there and comfort him\u201d is that what you perceive or is he telling you that\u2019s what you need to do? ",
            "A lot of people covered this in very helpful and eloquent ways that I will take with me but I thought I would give my perspective as the (less severe and with no diagnosis) Charlie of my relationship. \n\nOne of the things I had to come to terms with is that when I plague my SO with all of my real and imagined flaws and fears that he will one day hate me the way I hate myself is that I am not the victim in that situation, but the aggressor.\n\nThat realization is sometimes more helpful to me than kind and loving words or even really good hugs. Sometimes what is more helpful to me than reassurances is when my SO finally says, \"Okay. I love you. Now I am going to go do X thing that I need/want to do.\" \n\nSpeaking as a needy person, the best thing for your relationship is ultimately going to be boundaries on both sides. You and he need to set them. \n\nMy SO and I made an agreement that neither of us will say \"I am the worst.\" I still sometimes slip but now my SO can say instead of \"I love you and you are not the worst,\" for the thousanth time, \"You said you were not going to say that.\" \n\nCharlie may or may not be ready to take steps like that, but I think it is important to discuss it when he is not in the middle of spiralling so that boundaries are introduced into the conversation and he can start thinking about what he can do to have more constructive dialogues with himself, instead of what you need to do to fix him, which you can't.\n\nYou seem like you love him and he loves you. I feel the same about my boyfriend. But we have been together for five years and his love is not enough to make up for the love I need to have for myself, no matter how much he gives. More importantly, the Charlies of these relationships will never be complete if we do not develop enough resources to give back to our partners. \n\nRocking the boat will be uncomfortable and scary, but if you are honest with him about your own needs, your relationship will have a much better outlook. ",
            "There are 6 levels of emotional validation. None of them are \u201cdamn that sucks\u201d \n\nLike I said in my comment, I have no advice to offer as I found myself in a similar situation & ran away from it because I didn\u2019t know what to do or how to help ease the anxiety of my partner, again because it\u2019s not my job. \nPersonally, I think op\u2019s boyfriend needs to really bunker down in his therapy sessions to get to the bottom of his anxieties. Turning sex, supposed to be a pleasurable experience, into 75% comforting your partner because they can\u2019t get you off? This isn\u2019t her problem, but she may be enabling him & making the anxiety worse. The strongest wolf is the one you feed. ",

            "Is Charlie lying about getting therapy?\n\nBecause this situation sure doesn't feel like Charlie is aware of himself, on meds or managing his anxiety AT ALL.\n\nIt is not your job to 'baby' him like that, at some point you will either start losing attraction or get resentful/tired of it. I think you should talk to Charlie about how you feel when he does this and that he NEEDS to seek treatment to get better, that it is bad for your own mental health and that \"logically\" at some point there will be a breaking point if it continues that way.",
            "He needs to build his self esteem up. Tell him he looks good with new/different outfits. Keep doing little things to keep it alive between u 2 so he knows u are anchored into this relationship. He seems to just be really insecure. Maybe read the law of attraction and get him to change his mindset with thinking positive.",
            "It sounds like he\u2019s got some problems that need to be worked out through therapy or counseling. I\u2019d recommend figuring out what will work and comfort him the most from what you can do and also what he can do himself. They should hopefully be teaching him coping skills and how to better manage his anxiety in therapy. \n\nIt does sound like he really loves you, which is great! I hope you both can work through this! Best of luck! \ud83c\udf40",
            "Echoing a few others, be careful here. You cannot make him feel better about himself, even though he's putting it on you to do so. He needs to see a therapist and get to the root of this, and he needs to learn coping techniques for when the anxiety starts to really take hold (you can help with those, sometimes it helps having someone ground us that way so we can take over and talk ourselves down).

            "I think the best thing to do is to simply stop sexy time and tell him to work through this more with his therapist. After his therapist, you can debrief with him, ask if he feels confident yet, and if both parties are comfortable, then try again. Rinse repeat until he works through it with his therapist. But you cannot be responsible for making him confident. Nothing you say can make him love himself. ",

He\u2019s getting in his head during sex which is what many people are prone to do. Sex should be a process of letting go and opening up to the experience. \n\nI would suggest for him to go on runs or exercise on a regular basis, especially when his thoughts are starting to get the worst of him, this will help him get out of his head. \n\nIt\u2019s not easy to reassure a partner constantly, but your patience, support, and love are very helpful. It\u2019s normal for emotions or trauma to come up during sex. In fact, when you can have an honest dialogue, that\u2019s truly authentic lovemaking. After having sex, create a space in which you both can talk about what came up for you during sex and tell him the things he did that you really enjoyed. Even if it\u2019s something really small like, \u201cI love the way you brushed my hair off my shoulder\u201d.

That\u2019s incredibly selfish, unhealthy, and actually not helping him either.

Maybe he could also get specific about what he feels happens during a happy or fulfilling sexual experience, to sort of set a goal to attain. You could also try incorporating those affirmations into foreplay, \"i love you, I'm attracted to you, I'm staying with you.\" It sounds like he really needs to hear those affirmations.

I apologize that I am updating under a new username; I can't remember the password for the other throwaway I was using and never registered it to an email. Oops. I'm sorry it took so long to update; a lot has happened and I've done my best to keep busy.\n\n\n\nI want to extend my thanks to everyone who took the time to read my post, especially those who replied. I guess I kind of always knew in the back of my mind that my relationship was abusive, but felt that I needed permission to leave. I know that doesn't make sense. I guess I was just feeling so beat down by that point that I didn't even feel like I had enough agency to make my own decisions.\n\n\n\nSeveral of you expressed genuine fear for my safety, and a few suggested that I just up and leave while he was at work one day. That particular scenario didn't end up happening, but here's the story of what did happen.\n\n\n\nI managed to hold out for about another week or so after my original post. It was such a big decision, I wanted to make sure that I had all my bases covered before talking to him (apartment, possessions, cat, etc). I became more and more visibly depressed with each passing day - not sadness due to leaving, but just... a sad person. He eventually ended up asking me what was wrong when we were lying in bed one night, and I told him I was not happy in this relationship and that I wanted to end things. He took it quite well at first, and we managed to have some remarkably productive and civil discussions about how to proceed with belongings/living situation/etc, but of course that didn't last. He moved out about a week after our relationship ended (he insisted he be the one to leave). I had nowhere else to go at the time, otherwise I would not have dealt with his bullshit for as long as I did after the breakup.\n\n\n\nHe spent the next couple of days after the breakup basically sobbing and trying to convince me to take him back and give him another chance, but I stood my ground and refused to do so. Then, he devolved into insulting me, harassing me, and blaming me for perceived problems in his life.\n\n\n\nI'll spare you all of the ridiculous dramatic details, but there came a point where he was incessantly asking me to have sex with him 'one last time for closure.' I told him no, kept telling him no, and he said that if I wouldn't do it, then our breakup would no longer be civil, that I ruined that for myself, and that my decision to say no didn't deserve to be respected. I still said no. He slammed his fists down on the arms of the chair he was sitting on, and got up and came at me. We were the only two people in the house at the time, and I fled. I spent most of the night in my car in a grocery store parking lot a few towns away, only returning home when several roommates were around and awake. I feared for my safety otherwise. In retrospect, calling the cops would absolutely have been the best route to take, but I was so fucking horrified and exhausted that it didn't even cross my mind at the time. The next day was his move-out date, and I was so happy. While he was getting all of his shit out of the house, I went shopping. I bought a new bedding set, new curtains, some minor decor, and rearranged my whole bedroom as a mini fresh start. I really had a new outlook on things.\n\n\n\nMy roommates ended up kicking me out a couple weeks later so they could move him back in. He roped them in with his stories of how much he was suffering after I left him, how he was having such a hard time, how they're his only friends in the world, and how awful I am. These roommates were some of the best friends I ever had - lifelong friends, like since childhood... Having nowhere else to go, I pulled some pretty big strings and moved in with a relative in a nearby town and started to build my life back up. My ex started dating one of our mutual friends from uni about 2 weeks after we broke up - someone I was always suspicious of, but he always told me to never worry about her. So, there's that. Hope they're having fun or whatever. A mutual acquaintance has told me that he treats her the same way he always treated me.\n\n\n\nThings are much better now. I have since saved up some money, quit my soul-sucking job, and now live and work in a different city fairly far away. It is really nice to not have to worry about running into my ex or my ex-roommates/friends. I've also started seeing someone else. He's been in a very similar situation to what I experienced. So, we are making sure to pace ourselves and we always try our best to be mindful of each others' needs and feelings, as well as our own needs and feelings. He treats me with genuine respect, and while things are still pretty new, I am optimistic about this, as well as my future in general. I'm pretty busy these days, but once I get health insurance from my new job, I am going to set up regular therapy appointments to help process all of these changes in my life, as well as my attitudes about healthy relationships and about my own self-worth.\n\n\n\nRandom internet strangers, thank you so much for being so kind and caring to a scared, tired, just plain beat-down woman. Your words gave me the boost of momentum I needed to solidify my decision to get the fuck out. I am so glad I did.\n\n\n\ntl;dr:  Left his ass, he got dramatic and somewhat scary, after some changes in life circumstances things are really looking up!",

All of the friends he lied to and convinced I was awful, had a loose vagina, abused him--whatever he could come up with--figured out the type of person he is. ESPECIALLY his roommates.

It makes me feel weird. Last week he asked me about my sex life which I'm not comfortable talking to him about it. He asked if I watch porn and if I do, what positions I like. I mean this is creepy right? I don't like it. My brother talked to me about sex but it was about safety and consent and things like that. Never these details that my father asks.\n\nI want him to stop these things, and that's all he talks about. Honestly I want him to stay away from me I don't like him, he gives me bad vibes. I know he's my father but I don't see him as family. He's just another person to me, a creepy person that makes me uncomfortable.\n\nShould I tell my brother about these things and ask him to keep my father away?

            "YES! If it was any other person, you would tell your guardian. This biological donor has no right to ask you any of these questions. It is creepy as hell as well as raises TONS of red flags. \nGood luck!",
            "Very inappropriate and thus creepy questions.  He is just a sperm donor not a father, and worse a potential sexual abuser. Tell brother show texts and block contact with him for your safety.    ",
            "Oy, you sound like you have an awesome brother. 100% tell your brother. Your father is a sick person. If nothing happens and your father still tries to contact you, tell your high school counselor. You need to cut this person out of your life ASAP.",
            ">He asked if I watch porn and if I do, what positions I like. I mean this is creepy right?\n\nYes, that is creepy.  Tell your brother what's happening.  You shouldn't have to deal with this.",
            "Not a single reply from OP. Smells like a troll post.",
            "Um please tell your brother everything he's said to you. That is disgusting, nobody during normal sex talks asks their kid what positions they like in porn??\n\nNot to make you feel freaked out or sad, but he was absent from your life most of the time. He probably doesn't even think of you as a daughter so much as some younger girl he gets to hang out with.",
            "I don't know if it's just because I'm high or what but this story sounds fake as fuck man. Nice job getting so many to buy it though",
            "I think whether you tell you brother or not is irrelevant. You will soon be a female adult and you'll often have to set boundaries with men/people in your life especially around sexuality. Take charge of the situation and learn now. The next time your father has an inappropriate conversation with you, tell him: I think that is an inapproprate conversation for a daughter and father to have and then end the conversation. Don't respond, stop talking. Set your boundary and enforce it. You'll probably be cringing inside, but remember, it's just a feeling. It will pass. The more you do this, the better you become at it, and the more comfortable you will feel about setting boundaries with people in your life. Good luck! :-) (Am I forgetting what it is to be 16? :-))",
            "> Tells me I look like a complete woman now. It makes me feel weird. ... He asked if I watch porn and if I do, what positions I like. I mean this is creepy right?\n\nOK, I'm your stereotypical creep-but-dosn't-realize-it guy. Just something about me is creepy, and I've never been able to figure out what it is so I can put the reins on it. Bear that in mind.\n\nThis is creepy as fuck, OK? This is not cool.\n\nThe best possible situation I can think of is that he simply has **no idea whatever** about how you talk to your kids, and is talking to you how he would talk to his trucker buddies. (truckers: do you guys discuss positions? Does anyone?) I'm reaching for this, too.\n\nBut frankly, sweep all that aside.\n\n> Honestly I want him to stay away from me I don't like him, he gives me bad vibes. I know he's my father but I don't see him as family. He's just another person to me, a creepy person that makes me uncomfortable.\n\nThen you don't have to. It's nice to give him a shot, because children are important to people, but he more or less blew it.",
