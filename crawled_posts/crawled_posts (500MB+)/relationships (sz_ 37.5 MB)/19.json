I decided I was going to talk to him one more time and set a boundary about these 'jokes' or tell him I wasn't moving in with him and that maybe we need to reevaluate the relationship. I told him I wanted to have a serious discussion and he immediately asked if I wanted to break up with him because he figured it was coming. I was taken back because I didn't expect that reaction. I didn't say anything at first, but then I told him that I wanted to talk to him about his jokes and, honestly, his behavior in general when it comes to people and making fun of them in such a mean way, especially when they ask him to stop. I also did a little reading on verbal abuse and abuse in general and things were a lot more clear. \n\nSo, he listened to me and then told me that he didn't like people trying to \"change him\" and that his last girlfriend had tried to do the same and she couldn't accept him for who he was; he thought I would be different because I was more understanding and fun. I'll admit, that is probably one of my flaws, that I try to understand everyone's position about most things and give them far too many chances, there are exceptions, but for the most part, I will try to understand someone and work with them on it. I asked him if she, his ex, and the overweight friend were the only ones who had left him over this behavior and he told me that he'd lost a lot of friends and dating was hard because women tended to cut out pretty quickly, again, in his words, because people are too sensitive and want him to change how he is. He seemed very stuck on being accepted as he is and angry about people trying to change him. I changed direction and asked him if he actually thought anything was wrong with what he said, I used my experiences, specifically, and told him about how I felt when we were looking at places and he said what he said to the potential landlords. He, of course, said they were jokes and that he'd never think less of me because of how much money I made because he kind of figured I didn't make a lot because of how I tended to do things. I asked him to elaborate and he said how I was always on things like Groupon or using coupons at stores or wanting to go out when places had specials or something and he was never around anyone who needed to do that type of thing. So, I told him that I did think he has a problem with people who earn less and don't live a similar lifestyle to him and that, maybe, he just didn't see it. That, sometimes, we are trying to be \"good\" because we have these thoughts of how we should be on the surface and we try to follow them, but when it's more close to home, our real feelings come out because we're faced with it more and I told him that was okay, but that I didn't think it would work for us, that he might be more comfortable with someone who makes the same amount as him and can contribute how he'd like. He interrupted me and told me he didn't want someone like that because he couldn't be himself around someone obsessed with money and material things (not what I said, btw); that they'd be too concerned with money and he liked me because I wasn't that way. I kind of ignored that, but it kind of told me that he either doesn't want someone who has as much \"power\" in the relationship as he has or he thinks women who want more/expect more of him are gold diggers or someone trying to take advantage in some way, I don't know. Anyway, I continued and told him that even if he felt they were just jokes, they were wearing on me and my self esteem and I couldn't live that way. I also told him that it's natural for people to not want to change when they've been a certain way for a long time and so it seems right to us, but that change can be good; that maybe therapy could be good at helping with that. I told him that it's wonderful to be accepted for who you are, but if who you are is, well, jerk-ish, people are a lot less likely to accept you unless they are also jerks and nothing good can come from a bunch of jerks getting together because they'll be toxic to other people, as well as to each other, and I told him I think he's better than that, that he deserves much better. That any woman he truly loves deserves much better than being verbally abused and made to feel like they aren't his equal or worthy.\n\nHe sat there and didn't say anything for a while, just looked at me and sighed a lot. He finally said he was disappointed in me for wanting to abandon him because he thought we were true soulmates and he couldn't believe I was saying such abusive stuff about him. I was shocked he was calling me abusive because I didn't think I was being abusive by telling him why I don't want to continue if this is how he will act and that the way he acts is not, well, good. Maybe I went a little far in saying anything about a future girlfriend, but I guess I wanted to impress on him that, if his friends and partners keep leaving because of this behavior, everyone will keep leaving. The only partners willing to stay will be someone who dishes it just as well as they take it, and he knows he's actually very sensitive and wouldn't like that or it'll be someone who lacks any self esteem and he'll make her feel even worse about herself until she breaks down. Like, I could feel myself getting to that point and that's why I'm so angry and frustrated. Not only with the fact that he was now turning all this around to me being abusive, but that he still didn't really seem to get what I was saying about my feelings; it made me realize, yes, I need to leave this situation and I do feel bad about it because I do feel like I'm abandoning him, but at the same time, it just doesn't seem like my feelings or anyone's, are important to him, so why should I stay with someone who doesn't seem to get that his behavior isn't exactly such that gets people to stay in his life? I realized I probably wasn't going to get to him and the conversation itself had me shaking because I was upset and disappointed, myself. However, looking back, I could see signs that this is who he is, other people's feelings just don't mean a lot to him and doing some soul searching, I realize that I, stupidly, thought he would change over time, but waiting on that is wearing on me and our last conversation tells me that he doesn't see anything wrong with what he does, so it's unlikely he will change. \n\nHe didn't seem interested in saying anything else besides that he was sorry I felt the way I did. I told him that I thought we needed to give up on things and find someone better for ourselves elsewhere. He didn't say anything, so I just left. A few hours later I got a confusing text from him telling me that he \"hadn't seen who I was and that I had abusive tendencies\". I didn't respond and just blocked him on everything. I'm sad things ended the way they did, but it was probably for the best. I'll either be good alone or I'll find someone who I work better with. And I want to give a huge thank you to everyone who commented on my last post and sorry if I didn't get back to anyone. I've been quite torn up over this, even though it was my decision. I miss him more as a friend than a partner, but I don't think being friends would work out too well, either, so I'm just leaving it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Tried to have a talk with my bf, didn't go well, so we broke up. Oh well.",

He needs to get over himself because he's literally delusional about himself. No one's trying to \"change\" him. He just refuses to acknowledge any of his flaws and try and work through them. That's the mark of someone extremely immature and definitely below your level. I mean he's literally acting like a 15 year old boy. \n\nLet him go find someone as shallow as he is. You're not abandoning anything, and throughout that whole conversation not ONCE did he acknowledge that he hurt you, or even talk about you!

            "You stood up for yourself and he did not like that.\n\nYou did the right thing and I do not think you are abusive. You handled the situation well and expressed your needs, but ultimately he is unwilling to listen. Unfortunately, he will be told this repeatedly until he learns or gives up and lives alone. This is not about controlling him, this is about him realizing he needs to change by growing up and developing empathy. He is not husband material and he is not ready to be a father.\n\nGood call and good luck moving on,",

I'm also a very understanding person like yourself, and I think it's hard for us to call someone out sometimes. I also came to realise that understanding why someone did something, why they are the way they are etc. does not mean that that's okay. Good on you for standing up to him!

So we swapped their numbers and they have been together almost 2 years.

            "I sort of doubt that he actually felt like you were being abusive. I'm thinking the word 'abuse' only popped into his mind when you brought it up. He knows that you're empathetic and care about how other people feel. He knows that if you found out you were abusing someone, you would feel horrified and guilty and want to make amends. He only threw that word at you to manipulate you into staying. \n\nIf my read on his thought process is accurate, that's borderline psychotic.

I was polite, clear and concise much like you were, but she immediately played the victim and said how \"she couldn't believe I was abusive like her last relationship, that I knew what it had done to her mentally.\" I've learned the hard way in life that the most toxic people will always try to turn your own insecurities against you so that they can keep up the manipulation.

He doesn't want a partner.\n\nYou're better off and you can and will find someone who doesn't treat you this way.\n\nFor future, always observe how they treat others such as waiters, service workers, homeless people, what jokes they make about people with disabilities, of different races etc.",

He is clearly not interested, and him trying to turn the talk into you being the abusive one is just further proof that you need be away from him. Look at how many people have left him, and he's not even vaguely entertaining the thought that maybe he should rethink his ways... It's very sad. Blocking and moving one is the right choice here, you've done more than enough, you didn't even owe him that thoughtful talk about what's making you leave, with such a soft touch. \n\nAnd while I think that always trying to put yourself in other peoples shoes and considering people's point of views is super important, giving people too many chances when they're actually being abusive to you is something to work on as well. It's a fine balance, and getting better at discerning what is and isn't abuse (abuse should be cut off your life right away in my opinion, no more chances given) is a great skill to develop. It's the difference between being understanding and being a doormat, and it's really hard to figure that one out.",

It progressed into a suicid attempt because he made me feel like money was all that mattered and since I couldn't offer that, I didn't matter. \n\nYou're right, your feelings don't matter because your feelings, to him, are silly. It's not him, it's you, for being too sensitive. Cut your losses and find someone who loves what you CAN contribute to the relationship. And don't feel bad for him, for a second. You aren't abandoning him, you are putting your mental health first. He is pushing you away.\n\nGood luck.",

Him trying to explain to you that him joking around as he called it and being abusive to you was who he was as opposed to what his behavior was is ridiculous. Behavior is a choice. He chooses to make fun of people. Be chooses to say those things to you. He chooses that. BEHAVIOR  IS A CHOICE. Who you are isn't what you're behavior is. It may drive what your behavior is but you can change that behavior. I work with emotionally disturbed and behavior disordered middle school students. They don't accept responsibility for their actions because they feel that people are trying to change them. No. We are trying to get you to change your behavior.

It is good for big picture things, like being open-minded about other views, but has been not so good for me with relationships.

I have a pretty good job, and probably a slightly above average income for someone my age in my area, and I have had men do the same thing as what happened to you, only flipped. They\u2019ll make snide remarks about how I probably think I have more say, or can afford more, or throw my money around (I don\u2019t, I\u2019m actually a lot like you in that I look for deals, bargain shop, and like to have savings). Insecure people are just insecure people, and someone who won\u2019t see his flaws or want to change or get better is NOT someone we want to spend our lives with. We are very accommodating people, and lots of men would  be lucky to have someone who can give and receive love in many ways, who may have our own love language, like many people say, but are grateful and accepting of love given to us in ANY language because we can see the intent. That is actually really rare.\n\nI have found everyone wants to love and be loved. But it\u2019s fewer people who are truly well adjusted enough to be who we (all people) need. Don\u2019t settle!

Your ex's entire conversation with you around this was one giant attempt to deflect attention from his own behaviors including the one of throwing out the abusive accusation at you.

And decided that this was the sign to end things and go. Because let's face facts, your ex knows his behavior is a problem. He knows it's why people keep leaving him. But it's the behavior he enjoys so much he's not willing to change or even accept  that this type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable. \n\nHe won't ever change, because he enjoys what he does to other people. It's not that he's not aware of other people's feelings. He very much is and he very much enjoys the power he has to hurt people through those feelings and emotions. And he's not about to give up his own enjoyment of that and that's really what he was saying to you. \n\nAnd this is the person you leave in your past, take note of the red flags he showed, and use as a blueprint of the \"If I see this in someone else I'm gone,\" varieyt. \n\nI'd almost pity the guy if his type wasn't such a slow poisonous stain on other people's happiness.\n\nAt any rate you are free of this. And I think the longer you stay free the more you're going to realize how much his behaviors affected you and how much better life is without him in it. Thank god he showed you this before you all moved in together. Or you'd be stuck in a much, much worse nightmare. Go live your life. Understand you were not abusive. That's a really common tactic abusers like to use to try and deflect from their own behavior. And his entire conversation with you was one giant deflection to try to get you to back down, so he could continue the behavior he enjoys.",

So when mine finally flaired up, he got upset with me because he didn't need my negativity atm. That one is also gone. I was with him for 3 years. The moment he got mad at me for not being bubbly 24/7, I realized I was already breaking up with him around the 2 year mark, but held on in hopes things would get better. \n It all made me realize once again I was being too patient and giving the guy too many chances, but in a different way. This one wasnt abusive, just other issues (hurtful and nonhurtful both).\nI had stayed in a dead end relationship for a whole year, because I didn't want to hurt him, and was hoping he would finally step up. \n\nBut I had still, even after learning from the first ex, made the mistake of giving them lots of chances.\nAnd I may still make that mistake in other relationships, because I always hope for the best out of my SOs.

            "You showed amazing strength in this situation and absolutely did the right thing. I am 49. At your age, I never would have had the confidence and strength to do what you did - for yourself. Yes, you will probably miss some things about him. Breakups are hard, but you acted 100% appropriately here.",
            "Wow he totally tried to turn it in you as jerk to the end trying to find a way to hurt you.. \nNot the outcome you hoped for but still over all a good one.  \nYou are incredibly stronge and it's great that your esteem is still good enough that you could make this choice",
            "Good riddance. My cousin is like that as well, especially when he is drinking. He starts sounding off and taking shots at me/other people, but whenever I say something back he gets real angry (there is a lot to choose from with him). The guy sounds like he\u2019s real toxic and no matter what, if something he says makes you feel x or y, then you have a chance to do something about it.",
            "Great job all the way through that conversation!  You have every right to be proud of how you handled that!  And to confirm, you were not abusive in that conversation.  You were kind and showed a lot of caring.  I wish you all the best!",

            "Congrats on breaking up with your goldfish.  For real though, that's an impressive lack of intelligence in the most basic sense.  He literally can't understand, on a deep level, that other people are real and have feelings separate from his.  That's something you learn around age 7.  That just because YOU want a Barbie for Xmas, doesn't mean everyone wants one.  So when you're hurt and he's happy, it means you're defective.  Because he's happy, everything is perfect.  When he's hurt by you doing what's best for YOU, it's a crime.  \"I feel yucky!  Call the abuse police! I've been victimized!\" This guy never matured past age 6, throwing a tantrum with bigger words now.",

            "He wants to act like a child and damns anyone who tells him to grow up. Then he attempted to make you the bad guy so he didnt feel bad. What he did in that moment was justify his behaviour. I love you so much for seeing through his bullshit. You are amazing and you deserve better. So does he and I hope this is a wakeup call or he gets one that leads to him growing up.",
            "I'm proud of you for recognizing that he wasnt going to change and walk away, from past experiences that takes a lot",

            "He seems to be displaying certain narcissistic traits tbh. Such as gaslighting, invalidating your feelings, being concerned with status, projecting his bad behaviors onto you etc. I\u2019d look it up.",
            "Empathy is not a flaw! It's perfectly normal for you to give people a chance to prove themselves and to change their behavior.  \n\n\"I'm sorry you feel that way.\" Is a textbook misdirection. You have every right to feel however you want to. He needs to take responsibility for his actions. You've taken responsibility for yours. Now go out and live your life! Do take some time to really absorb what happened and keep it in mind for the next relationship. It's really easy to fall back into the same cycle. \n\nCongrats on being so brave!",
            "You have the patience of a saint! I wouldn't have spent so much time trying to make him reflect on his behavior. He needs to be dumped a few more times until he starts realizing the problem is not with others. If he ever does get it. Some people stay oblivious forever",
            "You sound like you've just very narrowly escaped a narcissist. You've been abused and when you stood up for yourself in the most gentle way possible, you were gaslit. Everything others in this thread are telling you about this guy and what he did to you are true.",
            "I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019ve had to go through this and also glad that you realized you had to get out.\n\nI really find it bizarre when someone is in a mindset of blaming everyone else.  I thought for sure it would hit him when he said he\u2019s lost a lot of friends and girlfriends.  At some point, one needs to look around and realize, shit, I\u2019m the asshole.\n\nMaybe one day he will realize the error of his ways, but who knows.",
            "You're a good person, OP. It's really easy to see from how you tried to be understanding in the face of his abuse, to how much worry it caused you when he tried to turn everything around on you. \n\nI've been right where you are with my ex. Some people genuinely can't see beyond themselves, and have no desire to change for the better. Don't do what I did - beating yourself up for the shortcomings in others helps no one.\n\nKeep being your kind, understanding self. Don't let anyone make you think less of yourself for how you do you. Don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm.",
            "This conversation reads exactly like conversations with my abusive ex-husband. It makes me so sad thinking about the women who are going to be emotionally worn down and have their self esteem weathered away by these men in the future  :(  But we were lucky to get out. Now you can start healing all the parts he was breaking in you.",
            "That was definitely some gaslighting. Fuck that guy.",
            "Wow. That dude is a narcissist. He also used DARVO and then with the icing on the cake, he made a non-apology. What a piece of work!! \n\n(DARVO - deny + attack, reverse victim + offender)",
            "I legit read close to 70% of this post but ultimately my Adult ADD took over. Good for you though. He will continue to learn his lesson the hardway. I wonder if he has been abandoned by family members?",

You're now the latest on the long list of people who \"abandoned\" him for being a jerk.  \nHe won't make it far in life if he can't take any criticism, and unless he's the boss's son I can guarantee you it'll eventually effect how much money he makes.",

            "People Apology language are different, some people thinks just saying Sorry will fix the problem, some people thinks giving a gift after they have wronged u will fix the problem, Some people will show you some act of service, that's their way of saying they are sorry while some will hold responsibilities. It all depends on the person.\n\nNo one can actually change anyone, they can only adjust with you and that is if they truly want to. It's good stood up since you can't cope with him again.

I hope you never lose your fantastic grip on where healthy boundaries are because it sounds like you handled this like a BOSS. Maximum respect and I hope the sadness fades fast because you're clearly so much classier than your ex.",

A relationship with people like him usually never leads anywhere good or long-term.",
            "You said all the right things, you conveyed both how you were hurt as well as your interest in helping him grow as a person.

            "I join everyone in saying how sorry I am that you\u2019re hurting now, but you clearly dodged a bullet, and got your life back.  His behavior is a textbook case of emotional violence, manipulation and gaslighting.  Think of what  nightmare this guy would be with the millions of issues that come with marriage and parenting children or having pets if this is the (frankly, delusional) way he responds to being gently called out on his bullshit.

I'm so so sorry you're going through this, it's so painful.\n\nHonestly, men like this just really cannot take accountability or responsibility for the way their behavior impacts their partners. I wouldn't expect him to change, especially since hes flat out saying he wont. Even the guys like this who say they will change rarely do...\n\nSo I think you have to ask yourself, do you think these sorts of jokes and the little bit of jealousy/resentment he has towards you is something you can tolerate potentially for the rest of your life ?

He sounds like he had a lot of narcissistic tendencies, especially when he turned the abuse accusation towards you instead when what you said was more than reasonable. You'll find someone who appreciates you for you and doesn't care about your income. People like that exist! Keep your head up, OP. You did a strong thing and you'll find someone who treats you better.",
            "I got stressed out just reading this because it reminded me of past relationships that were similar. I can see some of his perspective because growing up my family picked on each other as a form of affection and I kind of internalized that but the difference is when that\u2019s the issue and you\u2019re confronted, you feel bad and (usually) can acknowledge that it wasn\u2019t okay and try to be more self aware. If you actually care about other people have just have unhealthy habits in relationships eventually you can look at yourself and say if a couple have said this to me then maybe I need to do some soul searching and try to understand why I do this and how to adjust because it\u2019s not anyone\u2019s responsibility to accept my flaws if they are hurtful and unhealthy. There is the alternative where the person knows enough about manipulation and tries to turn it around on you, as I had a physically and mentally abusive ex tell me that there was something that made men act a certain way towards me. Unfortunately this guy sounds like one of those and doesn\u2019t seem like he will change.  Even if he can change, you are under no obligation to stick around and *help* him, he\u2019s got to accept that whether he means it or not he hurts the people around him and then do the work himself, no one else can do that and it\u2019s an excuse to keep someone in a bad situation to act as though you aren\u2019t supporting them enough and excuse their behavior... you did the right thing and handled it better than most.",
            "There is a great book called \u201cWhy Does He Do That?\u201d that another commenter mentioned, I cannot even begin to explain how it helped me realize what I had gone through was abuse, abusers aren\u2019t all just terrible people even though they may be terrible to you so it\u2019s not uncommon to question yourself in these situations, and it also shows situations where abusers (and the author clarifies this could be male or female despite the title btw!!) claim they don\u2019t realize their behavior but in reality they know it\u2019s affective and use it to get the results they want.",
            "I haven't read other comments, so maybe this had already been said, but I wanted to give you a perspective on why he was calling you abusive that may help.  When you call someone out on a behavior they have that is hurtful towards others, what you are doing is trying to create a sense of empathy within them, so that they can see their behaviour from the side of the victim and draw that connection.  This isn't news to you, I'm sure, but what is sometimes more difficult to appreciate is that we do this because we are projecting the expectation of empathy that we ourselves would have if the situation we're reversed.  It's great if this conversation works out and he has that side realization, but you hit the nail on the head by asking if others had pointed out this behavior to him, to which he confirmed.  This means that he's incapable of processing emotional empathy for the suffering of others.  This is not uncommon, believe it or not.  Humans have a wide variety of mental perspectives, and our flaw is that we run around thinking everyone thinks just like we do, but not everyone does. We recognize psychopaths and sociopaths because they are so obvious, but in the same respect as why those mental perspectives are possible, so it's everything in between.  Some people's ability to emotionally empathise with other's is limited to people they know and care about, while they cannot emotionally empathise with the suffering of strangers, and others have no emotional empathy for others whatsoever and process empathy in term of themselves being the victim.  He clearly is in the second camp.  Not to get political, but correlations have been made with these groups of people and leaning right wing, which over the last few decades has almost seemed to pander to this type of person, which could infer that there are enough of them out there to warrant political pandering.\n\nAnyway, the long story short of this is to say that you may find solace in the fact that while he is indeed a jerk, and I'm sure you connected in ways that will make it difficult for you to move on emotionally, that the reason this didn't work out for you is not a result of your financial position or disability, it's because you got stuck with someone of the wrong brain type.  There are people out there who do not think this way, you just have to keep searching, and believe it or not this example will help you find that person in the end, because now you know what to watch out for.",
            "(Not dissing OP at all) I'll never understand how women who are so introspective and caring end up with guys like this. It's why I sometimes understand where nice guys and incels are coming from. Like, he had to be super handsome or charismatic or something for you to ignore his bad tendencies to the point of being about to move in with him right? *Shrugs* I guess I'm just glad you said looking back you could see the signs as opposed to \"he just changed one day\" or \"it came out of nowhere\" like women say 75% of the time to, I suspect, make themselves feel better about the ignorance.",

As I read the original post and this update, I kept stopping and thinking, damn she\u2019s hitting the nail RIGHT on the head with this guy, about him switching the subjects, being disrespectful, not at all actually admitting his fault in any of this or even focussing on how you feel (EVER.) Tbh, from an outsiders prospective, he seems like he was babied and is super in his own head, wanting to be accepted but not being able to cope with personal responsibility is a big bad character flaw imo.

            "Did you break up with this guy over Reddit advice? To be honest, he doesn't sound all *that* bad. As a fellow jokester, I understand the phrase \"you know I'm totally kidding, right?\". He probably has some comedic defense mechanism. I joke around as if I'm a douchebag as well. Doing it with things like money, looks, religion, etc. Is taking it a little far, but for example, I call my friends nerds and losers a lot, and they know I'm just kidding around. I don't see that as a huge deal either. Once somebody knows you're just joking, they know you're just acting like a douchebag because that's what people ACTUALLY act like. It's satire. You're pointing out how ridiculous some people are. If you told him not to joke about money, and he still does it, that is a problem, but I'm not sure why you guys broke up over it. It sounds like you had a serious talk, and you ended it with him because his response wasn't 100% what you expected, maybe because Reddit had their pitchforks out, but these people don't know him and they don't know you. Sounded like he was honestly trying to understand. In your initial post, when he said \"you know I'm just kidding, right?\", I wouldn't take that as a dig at all, he was pointing out how douche some other people are for a laugh. Once you tell him THAT subject makes you uncomfortable, you're right, he should stop on the serious topics, but it sounded like you didn't even give him a chance to stop, you got so upset in the initial discussion that led to a full-on break up. I don't know him, or you, but it sounded like he didn't get the chance to change. To me, I sounds like he was obviously joking. Jokes don't convert well to text, so a Redditor reads that and thinks OMG, HE'S SO MEAN! But, I read it and thought \"you know I'm just joking,right?\", I really understand that phrase, because I've said it so much. When my GF and I started dating, we had a similar talk, but ours was more \"make sure STRANGERS know you're joking, before saying douchey thinks for a laugh\", so now I make sure I get to know someone, they get my vibe, before I start saying douchey things for a laugh. In my opinion, it really just sounds like satire. I'm not going to comment on the \"you're abusive\" stuff, that doesn't sound right, but people also say crazy things when they're upset. Sounds like he really cares about you, but I don't know him either.",

So glad to cut the cord with him\n\nHe likely has abandonment issues given his more advanced nature of trying to be \"accepted\" for how his is which is a total cop out for bad behaviour.  Consider yourself fortunate not to continue enduring his bs",
            "God....this sounds way too familiar.  I'm sorry that this has happened to you but just try to deflect any thoughts of blaming yourself for anything you know you weren't responsible for.

The nacissistic personallity traits are glaring in the overall picture you painted.  I wont say hes a full blown bonafide narcissist,  but at the very least it would seem he is lacking empathy and the ability to recognize whats too much and whats too far.  The fact that those things alone dont seem to bother him indicates hes well on his way.  Realize too,  that had you remained and your relationship progressed, you would have become his number one target.  Through that process,  your life would have been altered in some really sad and terrible ways.  Thank yourself, for being who you are.  You saved you!*",

I had to work on my lack of empathy and it's clear this guy needs to aswell. I sincerely hope he understands this at some point, although he is significantly older than me when I realised I had to change my behaviour.\n\nI'm glad you got away OP, he needs to work on himself and you need to get away from the toxicity.",

You said that you won't work a full time job because it will stop the disability money from coming in. So as a result you work part time. If you are able to work full time, you should. I feel like it's dishonorable to work less just so you can receive a government handout you don't need. Working full time could give you so much more money than any part-time job. Or is there something about your disability that prevents you from working full time consistently? If that's the case than ignore everything I said.",

The next step after the talk would be to open a joint account and have both of your incomes directly deposited into it.

(And obv stop joking about it because it's not really that funny)\n\nBut I am interested in what everyone thinks is fair. Let's fast forward and assume things worked out. If he had done what I stated and it came time for marriage. Would a prenuptial with a pre planned division of assets be fair? Assuming Party A made $300k per year and Party B made $40k per year. And the prenuptial said \"party B will get $50k per year of marriage or $750k, whichever is less, in case of divorce.\" Would that be fair?

And it went great. The first thing anyone said was when my dad immediately asked \"is that why you've been so damn weird the last three weeks?!\" Lol. Followed up immediately by a dad joke. \n\nWe are all going to talk to my little brother about it (probably today my sister, partner, and I are all still going for dinner.) And I asked my parents to pick out a new middle name for me (I've decided to stick with my given first name, it's androgynous). My dad's immediate response was \"Alwayswantedabeard Man Lastname\"\n\nSo I decided to let my mom have the final say in my middle name lol. \n\nI also set up an appointment to start hormone therapy in two weeks (and my insurance covers it!) So I'm pretty stoked about that. \n\nI hope you guys all have a great week!\n\n\nTl;Dr parents give no fucks, I feel like I just had 600 pounds lifted from my shoulders, I'm starting testosterone in a couple weeks!\n\n\n**Edit: to everyone PMing or leaving comments calling me a \"sick fuck\" or any other derogatory term, I hope you realize one day how hurtful and wrong you have been. Especially if you ever have kids that end up struggling the way I did.**\n\n\n**And to those of you (the vast majority in this post) who have been supportive and excited for me, I appreciate every single one of you, as well as your comments. Thank you.**\n\n**Edit 2: my first gold ever, thanks guys. You've been overwhelmingly supportive. Thank you all. You're wonderful humans.**",

            "I think it's very sweet and thoughtful of you to include them in the process by offering them the chance to give you your middle name. I *absolutely understand* that is not an option for most people who are transitioning, but you seem to have a good relationship with your parents and you suggested it yourself, so I think it's really cool. You get to keep your autonomy and do what makes you thrive, but also let them know that they're an important part of your life and identity. Or at least that's what I get from it.\n\nCongratulations! :)",

            "I'm sooooo happy for you! My sister (mtf) is transitioned and came out at around 30 years old. I had never actually seen her happy until she finally started hormones and therapy. She would always tell me how much it means to her that my mom and I were so supportive of her which to us was a given, we just want her to be happy and herself. When she changed her name she asked if I would mind if she shared my middle name and I was happy to agree not that she needed my permission. We got our middle name from our late grandma. Our dad didn't have the same reaction not that we were suprised. He told my sister he didn't have a son and that I was his only daughter, but now whines and crys and uses the proper pronouns now that my sister moved away and doesn't talk to him anymore. Anyways.

I'm so glad you can be free to be who you are with your family, you're very lucky to have such a wonderful family. \nI hope though, that sometime in the future there didn't have to be any 'coming out' crap. I hope everyone becomes as accepting and enlightened as your family. I would never want my kids being scared to tell me things about themselves, whatever it is. \nGood luck with the hormones! ",

            "I wasn't around for the original post, but I just stumbled upon this update, and I'm very happy for you. Also: fuck the people leaving hurtful comments. Currently, it's fashionable to hate on transgender people, and I can't wait until that trend is over. If ever. There's a long way to go.\n\nI've got one more thing to say, and I hope it'll help you although it might sound weird. Here goes: you're very lucky in two regards. One, your parents are supportive, and that's **awesome.** I'm happy for you that you have such great parents. And two, wherever you live: consider yourself incredibly lucky you can start HRT. Where I'm from, you have to jump through a million hoops just to get that chance, and the doctors you need to see are very rare and very overbooked. It's a pain in the ass - as if a transgender person needed **more** problems created for them. The fact that you can start in two weeks is a huge deal, and I hope knowing that can help you appreciate the support even more.\n\nGood luck on your journey! :)",

Hopefully in the generations to come it will just be as matter of fact as going to the dentist. I think it is really unfortunate that you had to go through all the stress of coming out to your family. I didn't have to come out as heterosexual. I think it is super unfair that people have to go through this. ",
            "I'm so proud of you, and glad it went well!!! My parents have always tried to make it clear they would love my sister and I regardless of our sexuality (or gender identity, I assume) but I was still terrified when I came out to them as bisexual.

        "selftext": "[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aiyf0c/i_23f_have_always_had_intense_toxic_relationships/)\n\nA few months ago I wrote about dating an actually stable guy after only having toxic relationships. The post got more traction than I expected so I figured it might be nice to do an update. Thank you so much to everyone who replied to my post, all the replies really helped. \n\nAs it turns out, the guy I was seeing found the Reddit post, clicked that it was me, and talked to me about it. Turns out he actually felt the same way in terms of low intensity but he liked that, and I decided to keep dating him for as long as we kept having fun together. \n\nWell, I\u2019m happy to say that last week we celebrated being together for six months, and that we are quite madly in love with each other :) \n\nAfter we talked I took the advice of some of the commenters and tried to just enjoy my time with him instead of worrying about the depth of my feelings. I soon realised that he\u2019s a kind, thoughtful, intelligent person and we totally get each other. He makes me laugh with the most inane stuff and he thinks my dumb jokes are funny too. We can talk for hours and hours about anything at all and I rarely feel like I have to justify or explain my point of view at all - he just understands me. One of the first times I knew I was really falling in love, we were chatting in bed, and suddenly it was 3 in the morning and I realised we\u2019d been chatting for three hours without a single awkward pause. I\u2019ve rarely had that with anyone else, and never with a previous boyfriend. \n\nI think most of the commenters were right. My other longest relationships were all built around toxic intensity and wild passion, and while this relationship definitely isn\u2019t lacking in the bedroom, I\u2019d say it\u2019s much more built on a sort of close friendship and respect for each other. It\u2019s certainly not as filled with longing and deep passion as other relationships I\u2019ve had, but honestly I prefer being with him. I feel like I have not just someone to go out with or to cuddle up to, but a genuine life partner - somebody who supports me, who I can talk to about anything, someone who makes me want to be a better person. It just took me a while to realise how much better that calmer, more peaceful love is instead of the rollercoaster/intensely toxic relationships, and I almost made the mistake of thinking that it was boring and throwing it away. I really just needed time to get used to dating someone who doesn\u2019t play games and displays his affection openly and frequently. \n\nWe did have some slight issues with communication to start with - mainly me being afraid to bring issues up/suggest things because of other boyfriends overreacting terribly in the past - but after we talked a lot he\u2019s been very supportive and proven himself to be a mature enough adult that he can handle occasional criticism without getting super defensive. It\u2019s been really refreshing to be in such a drama-free relationship where we can argue or talk about issues in a really healthy way. \n\nThank you to everyone who replied - you all helped a lot and I\u2019m really glad I took your advice and didn\u2019t just break up with him. I love him a lot and I can see us being together a long time. Thanks :) \n\n**TL;DR:** Turns out I just needed to adjust to a healthy relationship. Boyfriend is great and we love each other a lot. Everything is awesome, basically.",

            "5 years ago I started to date a guy and felt like you did in the beginning. 2 days from now we are getting married!\n\nThe thing is that the excitement it lacked in the beginning came later and I keep falling deeper and deeper in love him! Now I feel butterflies when he texts me and get all excited getting home from work to see him.",
            "I'm currently going through this whole issue myself and reading both of your posts and the comments has helped me see things differently. I've spent the last three weeks trying to decipher if I really have romantic feelings for this man or just seek his friendship. I've been waiting for the spark I usually chase after which has always ended horribly. \n\nThank you for sharing, you're helping so many other women and men in your position. Congrats girl!",
            "He sounds like a keeper, I'm so happy for you!",
            "Very happy for you! I can relate to how weird it feels to have a non-dysfunctional relationship for the first time, but boy is it worth it!",
            "So often the exciting highs can come from a comparison with very hurtful lows. The \"oh my gods this is incredible\" comes as an aftereffect of \"oh my gods why would you do this to me\" and it makes the good seem so much better. It's not, it's just comparatively better. Your brain says oh hell yes when it's been saying oh hell no for a while.\n\nAt least that's how it was for me. When I finally met people who wanted to be with me, it was boring. But in reality, my \"normal meter\" was broken. My sense of self was shattered. I didn't feel like I deserved the good feelings unless I had to work for them. Then I figured out that not everything had to be a fight and not every kiss had to be passionate. It took a bit to accept that.\n\nGood on you for figuring it out earlier than I. Life is both short and long. Finding a good partner is key. Best of luck to you and your person. May it be full of laughter, love, and long conversations without unnecessary drama.",
            "I\u2019m super stoked for you! I just read both posts and I can tell by the way you talk that you sound happier. I\u2019m currently in the same shoes, with someone where it\u2019s so easy, and relaxed that it makes my anxiety go nuts lol.

I thought that me and my bf weren't right for each other or something. But then you pointed out that you knew your boyfriend would text back, you know he is always there for you and you know you can tell him anything. That \"passion\", that \"rush\", I was feeling when I was dating douchebags was from not knowing where the relationship going and if they really like me for ME.",

            "I'm so happy for you!\n\nMy ex was similarly worried about the feelings being very muted at the beginning. She decided we shouldn't be together.",
            "When I first started talking to my wife about us potentially dating, I told her that I wasn't interested in something that was \"white hot\" like my last relationship. It was toxic, codependent, and abusive but more than that it was... obsessive. Every second of every day required communication at a minimum. It was disgusting. \n\nOur love burned so fucking bright... and then it burned itself out and it was just gone. And we stayed together for another three years. Second biggest mistake of my life, that one.\n\n\nAnyway. my wife and I are about to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. I love her with my entire heart and soul. I've never loved someone so truly, so honestly. She's my best friend. And that's why I love her the way I do. I never had a honeymoon phase in this relationship. My love for her has been the same since the moment I fell in love with her. Never waxing, never waning. I love her as a person. Not as my fuck buddy, girlfriend, fiancee, or wife. Not for what she can do for me or give me, or because I don't want to be alone anymore. I respect her more than any person in the world. \n\n\n\nI'll never forget how happy I was when she stopped me one day and told me she had something to \"confess.\" She told me she was worried that something was wrong with our relationship because she didn't feel like she was \"in love with me the right way.\" She described it almost exactly like you did.\n\n\nWhen I told her I felt the same way, and then reminded her of the conversation we had over a year earlier, she felt much better. \n\n\nTL;DR: This is a good thing. It means you're maturing emotionally. Foster these feelings and make something wonderful together.",

            "I am in the same boat. Lots of toxic / abusive relationships in my past. Now I'm dating this super sweet, kind, loving, attentive guy. We started out kinda speedy, but from the first minute we met, we just clicked right away. We have similar interests without being the same person, we communicate, and we understand eachother. I've never had this with anyone else, and it's terrifying to experience because you're just waiting for the catch, or for them to do a total 180 on you. But I don't think he will. It's best to have fun with it.",

It took me about a month (or more) before I realized how feeling this comfortable and at ease didn't mean it was boring - it meant I was in a healthy relationship. Healthy relationships filled with constant wanting and longing fueled by passion and heightened emotions and tears...simply don't exist. \n\nMutual respect, laughter, stability, and comfort are signs you've got a good thing. Hold onto it. Happy for you, OP! \n\nAnd also loving how many others have gone through this and given \"boring\" a chance. Easy love is the best. :)",

There is so much love, comfort, and consideration to be found in a consistent partner, then one that keeps you guessing. \n\nHappy for you, OP!",

            "This is so lovely, I\u2019m happy it\u2019s working out for you. \n\nI went through a lot of crazy tumultuous relationships when I was younger too. I met a(n actual) nice guy nine years ago. I worried a lot about *settling* because I didn\u2019t feel completely insane all the time\u2014honestly it took a year for me to be deeply in love. We\u2019ve been married for 4 years now and I feel like I\u2019m living my best life with him. \u2665\ufe0f",
            "Yes to all of this! It took me 6 months to give him my number because I was so scared that it wouldn't work. Now a year and a half later we have a beautiful baby girl and I'm listening to them both snore in the bed beside me. Life is good! \ud83d\udc97",
            "Ahhh i feel this so hard!!! Ive been with this guy for a year and hes so healthy for me. I had lots of episodes where i felt like I HAD to argue over something or look for something BAD.

            "After reading your last post, I\u2019m so glad you shared this one.\n\nI\u2019m in a very similar situation (horrible abusive exes with all that passion) and reading these was such a relief. Your words are so relatable as now I\u2019m finally with someone I love deeply, who understand me on every level, but I initially almost walked away because I doubted our passion. \nI am so glad I didn\u2019t give up because he now means the world and then some to me.

I can somewhat relate because I also had a very toxic relationship before my current bf. At first it was a bit scary at how peaceful I am in this relationship and how easy it is to talk to him about issues without having accusations thrown at me or just getting all these lies and angry responses. I started to think it was simply to good to be true but after 7 months now, a lot of learning to communicate without fear, and actually learning to trust my partner I can say I'm in the happiest relationship I've ever been, and I myself even without my partner, am greatly happy overall.

He also gave me plenty of reasons not to open up. My husband now is awesome and he knows everything and accepts me for me. It also helped that we knew each other since kids and we're we always said we were going to get married. Better late than never. My husband had taught me alot, most important he taught me how a husband is suppose to be. We are equal 100%.  I had alot of toxic relationships throughout my life until now.

            "I so related to your worries in the first post. I started dating a guy and I thought we lacked passion. But I realized what was missing was drama and toxic need. \n\nWe\u2019ve been married for a year and a half now. He\u2019s the love of my life.

I am now dating a great dude who I love and enjoy being around but sometimes I feel myself acting out. I know I'm acting out but as much as I'm aware of what I'm doing, I can't seem to stop the behavior. \n\nDo you just start to grow out of it?

I\u2019ve been dating someone else for 6 months now. And this has really helped me realize the difference of being in a toxic versus healthy relationship, and helped me figure out my feelings for him.",
            "To play devil\u2019s advocate, it sounds like you talked yourself into settling. It works for some people. However, whenever I\u2019ve ignored my intuition, bigger issues have presented later. You can have passion and a healthy relationship; it doesn\u2019t have to be one or the other. \n\nYou\u2019re only 23. I\u2019ve seen posts from people in LTRs who settled, then meet someone who actually fires them up and mourn never having had a proper honeymoon period with their current partner. Passion fades, but if it was never there, you may come to feel like you\u2019re missing out.\n\nYes, you\u2019ve had toxic relationships, but that\u2019s part of becoming an adult. Don\u2019t make the mistake that \u201cnice, kind guy\u201d means \u201cI should tell my heart that this is all I can hope for, and forget about genuine love/romance\u201d.\n\nEdit:\n\n>  It just took me a while to realise how much better that calmer, more peaceful love is instead of the rollercoaster/intensely toxic relationships, and I almost made the mistake of thinking that it was boring and throwing it away\n\nDude, you can have those feelings and be in a healthy relationship. I\u2019ve experienced it. I\u2019ve also experienced being in a healthy but passionless relationship with a constant underlying sense that things weren\u2019t really right, but feeling guilty to break up because he was a great guy.",
            "I\u2019m glad you are making progress away from valuing toxic relationships over healthy ones!\n\nI do have to ask if you\u2019ve shared these feelings or even these posts with your current BF. Even in this update you talk about how the passion and sex isn\u2019t quite what you want, but other things make up for it. I think you need to be honest with him about that, because it seems to leave the door open for a healthy relationship that *is* wildly passionate (these exist!) in your future... maybe with him, maybe with a different partner. And maybe he wants a partner who thinks of him that way. Maybe not! I think you should be honest with him, though - and it could lead to the passion increasing.",
            "So happy for you! \n\nHonestly, I think most (young) women seem to think they prefer these intense relationships more than peaceful/calm ones is because it's usually what we see in movies. And I believe if a relationship is ALWAYS intense and passionate, there's no real solid foundation there - it should always die down into a more calm, content state. Passion can still be there, and it should definitely be worked on, but I just personally love it when the relationship changes to something more calm and comfortable. Stability is what I look for the most, so I personally can't have a relationship that stays intense the entire time. I still want that passion, but I know after a while it's something you gotta work on for a bit.",

If this is against the rules, let me know and I'll remove it!\n\n[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32m5lj/i_22m_just_walked_in_on_my_girlfriend_21f_of_7/)\n\n[First Update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/33aypy/update_i_22m_just_walked_in_on_my_girlfriend_21f/)\n\nHey everybody. I've been asked multiple times for an update, but it's been super busy, and I actually have a little time today, so I thought I would update everybody on my situation.\n\nMy ex made a doctor's appointment for a couple of days after my last post. She sent me a text with the date and time, and asked me if I would be going with her; I told her that I wouldn't but that I wanted Emily to go with her. She straight up refused and said this was \"our baby\" and that if I didn't go, she would cancel the appointment and wait until I was ready to go. We argued for a little bit until I gave in. I told her that I would meet her there, and I would stay for the entire thing, but I was going to be stone silent the whole time unless the doctor asked me a question.\n\nHer appointment was at 9.15 that morning, I showed up at 9.10 and sat across from her in the waiting room. The doctor called her back a couple of minutes later. They talked for a couple of minutes, she asked her some questions, and then she had her go to the restroom to pee in a cup (I made sure that her purse and everything stayed in the room - somebody warned me she would be crazy enough to buy a pregnant woman's pee and use that instead). After she gave the cup to the doctor, the doctor left and then she tried to talk to me. I sat there and ignored her and texted my friends until the doctor came back and confirmed that she was pregnant. I started shaking and tried to control my breathing, but my ex was so excited, and the doctor was excited with her. Then came the ultrasound, and my ex was roughly 11 weeks pregnant. After a couple of minutes, I excused myself and left. I texted her as I was leaving that before anything else happens, we're having a paternity test.\n\nFirst off, Noninvasive Prenatal Testing is super expensive. I told her that I would pay for half, but that if the child wasn't mine, then she would have to pay me back for that. She told me that her parents were willing to pay for it. Her parents have more money than I would know what to do with. Like... millionaries money. I told her that my ex-roommate was taking the test as well. She said that he didn't need to and I snapped saying that, \"I guess I can wait another 6 months. Because they won't put my name on the birth certificate until they prove I'm the father.\" She finally agreed with me and made him take the test as well.\n\nThere's a place around here that actually specializes in DNA testing, so we were able to get in just a couple days later. SHE BROUGHT HER MOM WITH HER! They told us that they would have the results in 10 days and that we could come pick them up or they could mail them to us, we said we would pick them up in person.\n\nI was too nervous to go to the results. Emily and Trevor both went in place for me. According to them, my ex wasn't happy that I wasn't there and almost refused to let them see the results, but her mom told her that she could understand why I didn't want to be there.\n\nI'll never forget that phone call from Emily\n\nE (Emily): Hey!\n\nM (Me): Well...?\n\nE: You're not the dad! You should have seen the look on your ex-roommate's face though! **He's the dad, I didn't make this clear. Sorry!**\n\n*At this point I squealed like a little girl.*\n\nMy ex attempted to text me later and I just ignored all of them. Both of her parents did text me though saying that they wish me well with teaching. That really meant a lot to me.\n\nAs for other things in my personal life... I've gotten a new apartment over by Trevor and Emily. My ex doesn't know where I live at the moment, her number is blocked, she's blocked on facebook, and everything else that I could think of to block her on.\n\nI've joined a summer baseball league and I play for that 2 times a week. I'm volunteering in the preschool classrooms on campus in the mornings. My job is giving me more hours (requested). I'm taking 3 summer classes, and I'm the ASL tutor for the summer classes now that they have started. I also bought a bike, and now I ride that daily as well. I also got a kitty. His name is Jasper. And I read a lot more now. I realize that I wasn't reading as much as I normally did while I was with my ex, but I've gotten back to reading!\n\nMy friends are saying that I'm too busy now and that I have even less time than I did when I was with my ex. I like that. The busier I stay, the less I think about her, and the happier I am. There's a week between the summer classes that I'm tutoring this summer, and Emily, Trevor, Emily's best friend and I are going on a 5 day hiking/camping trip.\n\nI want to say thank you for everybody that helped me through this. The support that you've all given me has really helped me. There are still the people that are saying \"This isn't true\", but I'm receiving a lot more positive support than negative.\n\nNo, Emily and I are not going to date. For the many people that have asked, I'm sorry to disappoint you and say that we're not. I don't see her in a romantic way, and I plan on staying single for a while.\n\nI'll be finishing up my BS in Elementary Education this upcoming school year, and then I still need to decide whether to continue schooling and pursue my MS in Deaf Education and Deaf Studies, or whether I should start teaching.\n\n**I'm sorry, I had to take the link down of Jasper. I was reminded that you are not allowed to post links.**\n   \n**tl;dr: She is pregnant! But I'm NOT THE DAD! Now to move on with my life**",

            "WOW!\n\nI just stumbled onto your older threads today in a search, read them and now got your awesome update.  This is truly a great update.  You sound like you are doing as well as anyone possibly could since the tragedy of last month.  I can't imagine how nerve wracking the doctor's appointment, the finding, then the wait on the paternity test.  You really handled it amazing in your boundaries and decisions.  I'm immensely relieved for you on the DNA findings.  \n\n>Both of her parents did text me though saying that they wish me well with teaching. That really meant a lot to me.\n\nThis is also incredible.  They probably like you more than their daughter at the moment.  It is really amazing and rewarding that they have such healthy perspective through this all and I am glad they sent you those texts.  It would give me a bit of closure, for some indeterminable reason.\n\nIn a weird way, I almost feel like karma was watching your back big-time.  Not only is she caught in her lie of 'it just being a one-time thing', but (and I'm kind of torn on this) she is facing a life-long consequence of her stupidity and betrayal.  Now, I am a father and I can only pray she grows up and loves and does the absolute best she can for her child... clearly none of this was the child's fault, but it wasn't yours either.  I'm so glad you aren't saddled to someone like her through such circumstance as she very clearly was going to remain immature and try to leverage a human life into control over you... instead now I hope that innocent baby leverages her and her adulterous partner to open their eyes and grow up into decent human beings and adults instead of the immature assholes they acted as last month.  One can only hope.\n\nBack to you- man I am relieved and impressed by you and your steadfast climb over recent obstacles and struggles.  I am so glad that things worked out as they did (you had a BIG role in that).  Enjoy Jasper, cherish the time camping/hiking with amazing friends, keep going forward in the amazing life ahead of you- and we are all glad you can wave goodbye and part ways with the two people who showed their colors (on accident) and are suddenly snowballing into their own uncontrolled future.\n\nAs chaotic and stressful as this last month certainly was, I suspect in some regards the drama and way it unfolded might be able to offer you a quicker and deeper closure or processing of the emotions and decisions (at least I hope so).",

            "My ex was pregnant when I was much younger and she told me I was the dad and whatnot so I went to all of her appointments with her and after EACH appointment, I'm not even kidding, she told me she cheated on me. First appointment it was one time, second appointment it was 5 times and on and on. Because the prenatal test is really expensive I waited until March when the baby was due and swabbed my DNA and did the whole thing after birth. The DNA facility called me a few weeks later, the week before spring break no less, and said verbatim, \"in the case of aut0matix, you are NOT the father.\" It was the only time I ever cried because I was so happy - not that I wasn't going to be a dad per se, but that she was a shitty person to have one with. \n\n\nAll that being said, I know how you feel to a degree and I can empathize.

            "I am completely taken and impressed with your maturity through this all. I can't say that when I was 22 I would have had half the brain that you have in a situation like this. Kudos (and karma) to you for not trash talking her, or her family. \nThis might be unsolicited advice, but I'm giving it anyways because I went through something very similar. My \"best friend\" slept with not one, but two if my boyfriends. I understand the feelings of betrayal are almost unbearable at times. Yes it is very important to continue moving forward and creating your new normal now with out her, but its just as important to allow your self to truly and fully process through those feelings completely. \nThere are things called small T trauma and big T trauma - both can be emotional. Work though it- even if you have to see someone to do it. I never realized what little spiderwebs creep in your brain and plant them selfs there until I had a second failed marriage at the age of 27. When I met my current husband, we both recognized that we were both a little broken obviously and decided to do couples counseling before we got married to make sure we didn't make the same mistake again. What it identified was that I had alot of small T trauma that was still running around (I like to picture it as a little gnome with a torch running through my brain pulling pages out of the drawers of \"shit I never want to think or feel again\" and scattering them about. Made it easier if I can laugh at it). Even though I felt that I had \"gotten over it\" and \"moved on\" there were little tendencies that I referred to as \"quirks\" or \"standards\" but were actually things more deep seeded. I realize that everyone is different, but please don't just try to forget it. Instead, try to remember how it felt not just emotionally but physically as well and while your brain is healing, associate those feelings with positive feelings. If you want to hear more about all this, or how to do it I can send you some helpful links if your interested. \nBut you're young, you obviously have a great head on your shoulders, and are going great places. Take measures to not let you feel like this again.. and not by not trusting. \n\n(SIDE NOTE: I'm sure I going to catch alot of shit for my grammar/punctuation... I'm a software developer.. english was never my strong suite and they don't expect it from us anyways. Please take it easy on me lol)",

Some of my friends are actors and were just in this play called *Tribes* by Nina Raines. I think as an educator, this play would speak to you and your students, a boy who's born deaf into a hearing family (family has no interest in learning any sign language) is introduced to the deaf community when he meets a girl, who can hear and was born into a deaf family but is losing her hearing. A lot of the local deaf community appreciated their story being told through this medium, and it sounds like something you might like.\n\nSorry for the tangent at the end- I get carried away when trying to pass on other pieces of literature to others.

        "selftext": "Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/am3mwy/my_25_m_boyfriends_26_m_anxiety_comes_out/). \n\nI'd like to begin by thanking everyone who left some input; I was overwhelmed by the response. Just know that I did read every single comment.\n\nIt hasn't been very long at all; I know that. And I truly don't know what the future holds. But here's what has happened in the past ten days or so. \n\nI admit, I should have talked to Charlie earlier before heading \"to bed\" again, but I was embarrassed about broaching the subject and still ruminating over the advice. \n\nAnd so, his anxiety flared again during sexy time that night. Rather than immediately falling into comforting him, I began asking him why he was feeling like he was and resisting the instinct to \"make it all better.\"\n\nIt was a little more tough love than I've ever been with him (and we haven't been together all that long), but it got him to open up. \n\nI did flat-out tell him (in a nice way) that this was getting in the way, that we had to solve this sooner rather than later, and that I didn't like him accusing me of being untruthful in-bed. \n\nAnd he responded to that, apologized, and agreed that we could not go on like this.\n\nWhat actually started coming up as we talked were some things I hadn't considered. \n\nHe was tired at the end of work, distracted by stresses from earlier in the day, finding it challenging both physically and mentally to stay focused and creating this self-fulfilling prophecy, where the fear of being distracted and unable to be a satisfying partner was doing just that.\n\nHe was also very embarrassed to not be in the mood sometimes, and I do think that was tied in to the \"failure\" mindset. If he didn't feel like getting going, he was failing me as a partner. I asked him to be open with that.\n\nI also told him that we didn't have to go all the way every time if there were other ways to enjoy the moment. \n\nAnd then on to concrete solutions. \n\nLong story short, Charlie and I have spent the last ten days or so just relaxing together at night and reserving early mornings for intimacy (thanks, /u/NerdWithoutACause). Less stress, less fatigue, and it's been a rather amazing physical solution.\n\nNo anxiety flares yet on this revised schedule, when we can do it first-thing and not be under the stress of a long day. But time will tell if this will keep up, I suppose.\n\nCharlie did have therapy three days ago, and he allowed me to look at the notebook he had brought with him. \n\nHe'd brought this all up, and there were some more \"in the moment\" solutions for when his anxiety flared. He's been very open about making the greater effort to control his symptoms on his own without relying exclusively on me.\n\nWaking up to him this morning, he also rather bashfully told me he was feeling under the weather and would prefer if we just cuddled. So we did. And other PG-13 stuff eventually came. It was nice, and I think I have hope.\n\ntl;dr: Resolved to stop comforting boyfriend in bed when his anxiety flared, and realized that outside stressors were part of his flares. We do it in the morning now when there are less of those stressors, and he's working harder in therapy and being more vocal about what he's feeling in the moment. I'm a happy camper for now. \n\n\n",

            "I recall your original thread, and this update is wonderful! The ideas of how we *should* be sexually rarely help us. Here's to continued enjoyment for both of you!",
            "This is wonderful to read. Congratulations on making your needs known, congratulations to him for seeking professional help, and congratulations to you both for mutual open communication. If y'all continue to treat any issues down the road like this, then you'll be a very successful and happy couple. Best of luck to you both. ",
            "This is such a good update!! Great job, OP, and I'm proud of your BF for opening up and being willing to work on his anxiety too. ",
            "that sounds like an excellent resolution. I think there's a lot of toxic stuff around men's sexuality, about always being \"on\" that can cause people to put up unnecessary defensive barriers around their sexuality. Creating a space where honesty, pleasure, and intimacy come first is a great step. Keep up the open and honest communication, and make sure you don't accept him slipping back into using you as a sounding board for his insecurities.",
            "So nice to hear a positive outcome! This sounds like real progress. ",
            "The best sex comes from good communication and lots of listening. You guys seen like a great couple and I am sure Charlie feels really happy that he can be open with you about who he is and what he wants and needs in this relationship. Best of luck to you both. I wish you only love and happiness in the future.",
            "So happy for you guys!!",
            "I'm so happy you guys are figuring it out!  It might end up being a continuing issue, it is still with my husband and I, but we have a great relationship and it's worth the work.  You're a great partner.",
            "What a great update and example of positive communication in a relationship. Best of luck to you guys!",

            "So happy for you both!! ",
            "This is so beautiful to hear. You guys are really doing a great job addressing the problem and communicating. I\u2019m sure his therapist already told him this, but he should look into meditation. There are so many great apps out there that you can download and then just put headphones on, shut the world out, and calm down in just 10mins. Blood pressure lowers, your mind clears, your nervous system resets...it\u2019s really powerful stuff. This would be helpful not just with the sexy time stuff, but as a way to manage his anxiety during the day or when he comes home. The happiest and calmest people I know all use meditation/mindfulness techniques to deal with stress. It really changed my life in every aspect! ",
            "Well this is great to see! Hopefully it continues ",
            "10 points to  Gryffindor!!!",

            "I had some pretty bad ED in bed. Constantly worrying about everything and it just wouldn't work. My penis doctor gave me viagra so I used it a few times and got a lot more comfy in bed. Everything was fine after that.",
            "This is one of the best updates I\u2019ve seen - I\u2019m so happy things worked out for you two without there having to be a big breakup. ",
            "Good for you! I have a partner who copes with anxiety, and is only starting to learn about caring for it at twice the age...so good for your BF, too!\n\nI know exactly what you mean about walking the line between comforting, or tough love, too. It still feels like an in the moment judgement call, to me. You sound really astute and tuned in, but funny beat yourself up if you flub it sometimes. There is emotional workload in partnering people with mental health challenges, it can't be glossed over.\n\nMy own boundary surrounding this - after less successful previous relationships - is that he must be working on it everyday. Self care, always. I get pretty out of patience when that stuff starts too fall by the wayside, with predictable results. He knows this explicitly, and we review it when necessary.\n\nGood luck, your guy sounds genuine about improving this dynamic for himself and for it's impact on your relationship, and that's worth a LOT, truly.",
            "this is great you give him some space to figure this out and offering him support in the same. Wish to have an understanding partner like you. ",
            "This is awesome! Solutions are out there when you both want to work on them. So glad you're feeling hopeful. Sounds like going forward you have a path to tame anxiety. ",
            "Great solutions all around. \n\nI would keep an eye out to ensure that your libidos actually match. It's possible he has a really low libido and feels guilty about that. \n\nI also prefer sexy times in the mornings. I have way more energy and I'm not burnt out! ",
            "Such a nice read in the morning I'm crying",
            "I have PTSD from some child hood sexual abuse. Sometimes I would be afraid of whether my wife actually wanted me, and it would cause me lose confidence and be afraid to touch her due to being afraid of rejection. It took so many hours of therapy and one on one talks to get to where I understood a great loving relationship.\n\nOP, it's great people like you and my wife that can bring out the best in their significant other. ",
            "Nice work. However I fear that this is a sign of underlying sexual incompatibility. Good luck and so wish you the best. ",
            "Very wholesome and cute! ",
            "What I have learned from living with insecure people is that sometimes when you think they have solved some problem, another problem comes up. If he is willing to do therapy, it would be great if he could do it for some time.",
            "Big wholesome.\n\nGlad that y'all are working through this together, OP.",
            "That's awesome. My partner and I are still learning how to please each other with out the stress of finishing or not being in the moment. It's nice to see other couples working it out too and communicating. ",
            "Your understanding and willingness to try and figure this thing out and make it work is heartwarming. I've had tons of anxiety issues during sex in my life, that self-fulfilling prophecy as you called it can be infuriating, how the simple idea of not being able to perform in bed is the catalyst that ruins everything on a night to night basis. And then losing that battle in your own mind forces you to live that reality that was only in your head a second ago. \"See, you CAN'T get it up, you CAN'T perform, you're not a MAN.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully through time and effort this issue will subside more and more. You're a good girlfriend.",
            "I hope he will realize how lucky he is in having a person like you in his life.",
            "Maybe I'm just cynical but this still seems like an awful lot of conditions and emotional labor and hangups to navigate just to have sex with your partner. Charlie sounds like too much of a fixer upper. Probably a good person, but an exhausting partner. ",
