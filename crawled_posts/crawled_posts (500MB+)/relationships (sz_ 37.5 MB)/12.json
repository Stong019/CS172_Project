He claimed I was the one who needed therapy because I had jealousy issues, and that my ex was one of his good buddies and I couldn\u2019t dictate who he was friends with. \n\nThen a week later he had another hangout with my ex and his friends where he proceeded to very loudly tell them how I was so insecure, and I was trying to tell him who he could speak to. My ex and Luke had to tell him to stop which he didn\u2019t like at all. I should\u2019ve just broken up with him at this point, but I was stupid and still clinging to the hope of my boyfriend going back to how he was. After this happened, my boyfriend was constantly making jabs at my ex and Luke but then he would still contact them and pretend to be friends with them. \n\nThen, he became super interested in what my sex life was like with my ex. He was constantly asking me who was better between the two of them and he would ask me if I had done this or that with my ex. I kept telling him I didn\u2019t want to talk about it and to stop asking me. I then find out from my ex and Luke that he had been asking my ex directly the same questions and that he had been bragging about our sex life to his friends. My ex said he was telling me because my boyfriend made a comment about loaning me to my ex if he ever felt like recreating old times. That was the final straw for me, and I broke up with him and moved out. \n\nMy now ex-boyfriend didn\u2019t take the breakup well and he went on a smear campaign. He even contacted my family and my ex\u2019s family to tell them we were apparently having an affair and that he had no choice but to break up with me. It\u2019s been almost a month since we broke up and he keeps getting new numbers to text and call me.\n\nDeep down I think I knew this would be how things ended. I\u2019m sad about the relationship I thought we had ending but now that I\u2019ve had space away from my ex-boyfriend, I feel much better and it's like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders.\n\nTL;DR \u2013 My boyfriend wasn\u2019t willing to work on the relationship and he kept doing things to embarrass/upset me so I finally broke up with him.",

            "Damn. Consider a restraining order or something. His obsessive behavior is concerning and it\u2019s better safe than sorry.",
            "This dude is nuts. Leave and don't ever look back.. seriously...",
            "Luckily you left! This kind of behavior would just escalate, and it was already weird AF. He was dismissive of your feelings and it seems even your ex and Luke were uncomfortable with him.\nYou\u2019re better off. Stay safe and if he keeps contacting you maybe look into a restraining order or something.",
            "He sounds deeply insecure and like he was trying to portray himself as some sort of big shot because he has you now and not your ex.... which is weird. It sounds like he was using you almost like a trophy, and constantly trying to compete with ex. I\u2019m glad you got rid of him, sometimes situations like that can turn dangerous in seconds.",
            "Holy shit. Was he like...actively driving/willing you to get back with your ex, or what. Girl, he legitimately sounds scary. Please look out for yourself.",
            "Maybe time to get a restraining order and a C&D order too.",
            "Please keep all those messages and get a restraining order. This dude sounds unhinged, and could potentially harm you.",
            "Well, well, well... If it isn't the consequences of his own actions",
            "He's probably sitting in a bush outside your exes house right now.",
            "Can you update us in a month and let us know if you're okay. This dude's behavior is scary. His behavior before you broke up was crossing boundaries, and after the breakup it was too. He is mentally ill and I highly recommend taking precautions to keep yourself safe. I recommend talking to a women's center/resource center to see what they recommend.",
            "Reading this made me feel dirty and not in a good way. The way he was acting and things he was doing really had me feeling that with every instance a film of immaturity, insecurity and awkwardness was coating me. \n\nIts rare to find someone who checks all the creep boxes but you found one! Good job leaving him. I am curious as to what possible redeeming quality he had that made you hold out to see if he would be some other version of what he was constantly showing you. \n\nI bet you feel like you can take a deep breath again. Hell I feel like I can after just reading through this and reading that you left him. Ha",
            "Jesus, looks like you dodged a cannon ball leaving him",
            "Man, I had a boyfriend become friends with an ex and it was weird as fuck. They met due to me and him running into the other and initially hated each other. Luckily no craziness ensued. I am with neither of them and they became close friends due to having lots of mutual friends and going to the same parties. The 3 of us joke that they got each other in the breakup. But I cannot imagine if one of them went nuclear like this or purposely planned to insert themselves into the other\u2019s life for some fucked up form of validation. Get a restraining order and document all attempted contact. This dude seems like he has the ability to go full murderer on you.",
            "I'm sorry that things didn't end up how you had wanted, but I'm glad you realize that it's for the best and that you deserve more! \n\nI'm sorry he tried to put you on a smear campaign, but I'm also glad that you're surrounded by people who knew he was full of it and that it didn't affect you or your character. \n\nGood luck in finding a nice guy who doesn't get creepily obsessed with your ex! <3",
            "was this whole ordeal completely out of the ordinary or was he a little nutty before?\nhonestly sounds like a mental illness :/",

            "First of all, yes, as with all other comments, this guy sounds like he needs serious help. It sounds like a scary novel lol. \n\nAnd I give you a ton of credit for being confident enough to realize it\u2019s him, not you, and to try to REASON with him, but get out of this situation and not doing \u201cwhatever you can to fix it\u201d when he wasn\u2019t willing to.",
            "I would contact the police. Getting new numbers to text and harass you is scary behaviour. This needs to stop before he escalates",
            "Please get a restraining order against the crazy person. Then, every time he contacts you, send screen shots to the DA. My friend\u2019s ex did this same shit (everything from contacting family/friends to making new numbers every day to send messages calling her awful names) and he eventually started coming to our apartment to \u201cdrive by\u201d and intimidate us. She got the restraining order, and he was arrested three times for violations before finally being charged with a slew of felonies and misdemeanors and sentenced to jail time, anger management, therapy and more. I know the order can\u2019t protect you right away, and he\u2019ll likely keep harassing you, but in the end he\u2019ll get what he deserves.\n\nBlock him on all social media and tell everyone you love to do the same. Then delete any remaining mutual friends. Block his number and each time he sends a text from a new one, respond, \u201cstop contacting me, [name],\u201d screen shot and block again. If he calls, record it (someone else can video you on speaker phone). My doing exactly this was the final nail in the coffin of my friend\u2019s ex. I played it for both lawyers at court, and his attorney (who\u2019d been told he hadn\u2019t been contacting her since the last court date), said, \u201cwell, I have to go speak to my client about lying to me,\u201d and that was it. I also provided screenshots of his contacting me to get to her, which helped a great deal since the RO includes third party contact, so have everyone he\u2019s reached out to send you proof. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry.",

            "Are you dating my ex? Cause seriously it sounds like it entirely. Did the same exact thing, obsessively until I kicked his ass out. He was gross. Glad you got away from that. File for a protection order.",
            "He sounded like the craziest guy ever.\nYou definitely dodged a bullet, makes you wonder what he would\u2019ve been like years down the line. \nSounds like he needs some therapy to deal with personality issues.",
            "Contact a lawyer who specializes in harassment, stalking and defamation. The police may not take you seriously  on your own.",

            "I would nix Luke and the first ex out of your life too. They don\u2019t seem to have your safety or respect as a priority. They should\u2019ve never entertained your recent ex to this level of insanity.",
            "Yeah, this screams out all sorts of insecurity issues on his part. Anyone obsessed with their partners' prior partner like that is because they are not secure enough with themselves and constantly need to compare their lives to ensure that they are doing \"better\" than the other. Quite a vicious and toxic thing to go through. Sorry you had to go through it.",
            "Im so sorry this happened to you. It sounds like your now ex came to a crossroads where they could grow as a person or go down a darker weird road of obsession that was sexually fueled. It's such a bummer when someone you love chooses to take the selfish path. It really was his choice.  I hope you're taking care of yourself, you sound like a kind and giving person. Remember that there's so many great people out there and I'm proud of you for standing up for yourself.",
            "Honestly, it would be hilarious if you got back together with your ex.",
            "What an absolutely terrible experience. It seems like you made the choice that best aligned with your values & thats really all that matters.",
            "Whoa, what a lunatic. Good job getting out of that.",

            "That dude needs some serious help.",
            "Good move op. Thanks for the update! I second talking to the police or a lawyer/nonprofit specializing in these cases. Often times police dismiss the threats of violence from domestic partners or former partners, especially when women make reports before violence occurs. Sadly, the police are trained primarily as a reactive measure in these cases. And, of course there's still a wide spread belief among older generations and law enforcement that women are overreact, are too emotional, or whatever misogyny makes these reports ignored.\n\nIf your ex is still contacting you, it's better to be safe than sorry. His behavior during and after your relationship is deeply troubling. I hope this doesn't make you paranoid, but be cautious whenever you go outside at night, park in well lit areas, make sure doors and windows are locked and secure, and just generally be \"situationally aware\" when you're outside your place. \n\nI'd recommend against a gun, unless you get a ton of training first. They're incredibly dangerous, and difficult to safely use normally, and especially during tense situations involving adrenaline. I'd recommend keychain pepper spray. It's non-lethal, but it'll put anybody down real quick. \n\nYou probably don't have anything to worry about, but unfortunately harassment and violence against women is something we're not even close to solving as a society currently. The pandemic has made it even worse. Stay safe!",

            "See y\u2019all guys can be crazy too",
            "I\u2019m glad you left. That\u2019s just so weird that he befriended your ex and did all that! You\u2019re a strong independent woman! Are you still friends with the first ex and Luke?",
            "I\u2019m so proud of you for leaving when things got toxic, even if it took you a minute to see it. I\u2019m sorry your ex is doing this to you, he sounds like a Class-A Narcissist(my ex husband was the same way) and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re away from him. Tell your family/friends that you\u2019re going no contact with him and to not give him any information no matter what. Change your phone number and block him on all social media(if you haven\u2019t already). I wish you the best of luck moving forward, sending love, hugs, and peace!",
            "Sometimes i think i can do weird stuff, be too insecure and shit like that. \nThen i read about those guys. And i understand that if i\u2019m not succeeding all the time i do spent most of it not being an asshole ready to destroy everything around him to feel better and that\u2019s make me feel less unhappy",
            "The ex sounds awesome for telling you. Good for him. And good for you!",
            "As a new mom myself, everyone's advice is spot on. This is shitty behavior and calling him on it so that he improves is necessary. I hope it improves, or you are able to separate yourself from him. There are guys out there that know how to parent and partner, so do not let him convince you otherwise. I'm typing this as my husband feeds the baby. He's also the primary caregiver while he works from home and I'm back at school. Sometimes I do still think things are uneven, so no relationship is perfect, but I cannot imagine how hard it would be to do this while also having a BF who is behaving this way.\n\nMy two tips, as you navigate this:\n\n1. If there is a task that isn't getting done but that bothers him more than it bothers you, congratulations it's now \"off your plate\". And tell your BF that when he complains. Baby stinking the place up or dinner not getting made? Tell him, \"that's off my plate. It's now your job to do diapers/make dinner.\" Diapers are a great way for the non-breastfeeding person to bond with the baby and show they're someone the baby can trust.\n2. Learn to say \"what do you mean by that?\" This question is great when someone (not just your partner) is making a joke or a comment that you know if you complain about they will brush off. Ask \"what do you mean by that?\" as if you're just confused. This puts the burden back on them to explain or rationalize. And when they can't it sometimes forces them to confront their behavior. They will not like it, but you're not arguing. You're just confused.\n\nBest of luck. Go for it",
            "You need to run, NOW. I've dealt with a crazy ex-boyfriend that was hung up on my sexual experiences before him (with one guy in particular) and this obsession went on for YEARS after I broke up with him.\n\nFor the record, that ex was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. This behavior could very well mean  that he's mentally ill, but here's the thing - that's not your problem. Your safety and wellness is at stake. You need to get away from him. His mental health is HIS problem.",
            "Seriously though..  who was better in bed???   Don\u2019t leave the world hanging.",
            "Well first mistake you made (I\u2019ve made the same mistake) is dating one of your exes (friends) I dated one of my best friends exes after him.\n\nWhile it went well in the beginning towards the end it crashed and burned badly. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible at least with me to date someone who someone I personally know has dated. \n\nImagine marrying that person and that (friend) is a brides man or groomsman. How awkward that is someone in that group has banged your partner.\n\nShe would constantly talk shit about him how bad he was at sex how gross he was ect, ect. After I broke up with her now they are \u201cbest friends\u201d \n\nNow I\u2019m in this awkward position where my ex and one of my best friends who also dated her are \u201cbest friends\u201d \n\nFuck this it\u2019s not worth the stress, date someone who knows NO ONE in your primary friend group.",

Him bringing up your insecurities infront of other people shows he isn\u2019t it and doesn\u2019t value you, you made yourself vulnerable infront of him and he brushed it off like it was nothing. He knew you weren\u2019t comfortable with him talking to your ex yet he still ignored n that shows how much he values the relationship. It\u2019s good you left him, I\u2019m guessing he couldn\u2019t believe that you finally put things to an end and didn\u2019t take it well.

His access must be SHUT DOWN - no discussion - just the silence of blocking - an info blackout about you. \n\nYou can ask people who care about to cut him off / block him on their phones & social media. No one in your life should be discussing you with him. Even for people in your larger social circle, you can ask for their cooperation. It's for your safety. \n\nIf I were you, I would also block on social media anyone still connected to him. This will reduce his ability to find out about you on his own. \n\nThis is about both your physical safety and your emotional well being. \n\nBTW, first ex bf sounds like a decent guy. Kudos to him for letting you know of his concerns regarding your new ex bf & how he was talking about you.\n\n............ \n\nOkay, you can stop reading here, unless you're interested in my friend's stalker story below and how she handled it. \n\n............ \n\n\nA friend of mine was stalked by a former coworker - both online and in person. MANY friends and colleagues were connected to this guy professionally and personally. \n\nShe documented his text and voice messages and got an order of protection. She also asked her entire social network to block him. Many were surprised by the request and many did as she asked. But others did not. So, she quietly blocked anyone who did not block him. \n\nIf the blocking ever came up, (for example, \"Hi. Good to see you. I messaged you a couple of times but I didn't hear back...\" She would reply, \"I have a stalker and was advised, for my safety, to block everyone he is connected to keep him from stalking me through my connections. My blocking people wasn't personal. We worked together, so we have a lot of connections in common. I hope that you understand.\" Sometimes she gave his name, especially if the person really wanted to know so they could block him too and reconnect with her. Other times, she left it at that. \n\nSo, he hit a brick wall. He used to show up where he knew she would be - everything from professional conferences he would not have ordinarily attended to a shop for a dress fitting. That was bizarre. He startled all of us, went back & forth between claiming to love her and saying awful things to her as he was kicked out of the shop.\n\nBut after the mass blocking, he couldn't stalk her as easily in person bc he lost the ability to find out what she was doing.\n\nAfter about a couple of years, it appears to have died down.\n\nObsessed people can't be reasoned with. During the time he stalked my friend, he got married and still kept stalking my friend! \n\nPlease cut your ex off, like the cancer that he is, from access to you.\n\nBest wishes to you and stay safe!",

Boundaries) that you even let someone act like that big of an ass to you. Coercing for sex, acting that insane etc.  if this story is even real then start some therapy ASAP.",

        "selftext": "TLDR: My parents have been trying to get me to move on really fast, get me to do all my classwork as if nothing happened, are pretty homophobic, and have been calling my late fianc\u00e9e terrible things and I do not know how to cope.\n\nSo, I woke up to my fianc\u00e9e being dead on Wednesday, April 1st 2020. She died unexpectedly and I don't want to go into the details of her death with strangers yet but it has been the largest, most traumatic event of my life. On the first day, I called her parents (50s M/F) who came and picked me up to stay with them for a week because my parents lived across the country and I just couldn't handle being alone in our apartment anymore. Me and her family, which are very kind and accepting people, grieved together and comforted each other. They were extremely sweet and kind people and I was very lucky to get to stay with them when it first happened. \n\nHowever, my parents were also informed of my fianc\u00e9e's death and made the long, multiple day drive across the country to come. They packed up my apartment for me because I just couldn't go back there (which was very kind of them) and picked me up the night after her funeral to take me to my childhood home. The first thing my mom did was complain about her own problems and how disrespectful/inconsiderate I was to not thank her right away or something. I don't really remember exactly what it was about but I didn't have the energy to argue or put up with her so I just mumbled some answers and tried to remain quiet.\n\nThen, later in the night as we were trying to go to sleep, my mom decided to start asking why my fianc\u00e9e didn't care for her that much and I explained it was because she is homophobic. My mom then went into a huge screaming tirade about how she didn't want her daughter to be a lesbian (I remember her actual quote being \"Well, I'm sorry that I don't want my daughter to become a lesbian!\") and how us holding hands when she visited us last year was extremely disrespectful. (When she visited us last yet, she made my fianc\u00e9e break down and cry so hard I had to drive my fianc\u00e9e somewhere to be without my mom for an extended period of time.) I just cried quietly to myself until she stopped screaming and we went to sleep.\n\nAround the first few days after my fianc\u00e9e's death, I would wake up crying and in a panic. Her parents would just hug me and we would cry and talk until I was able to calm down, but my mom that morning reacted by screaming at me. She was saying things like \"Stop crying!\" and \"I hate [fianc\u00e9e] now!\" and \"If she was alive, I'd kill her because you just keep crying!\" and just similar stuff. It made everything worse and I just wanted to throw up for the beginning of our long drive home. She also kept taunting me by saying she was going to put me in a mental health hospital or whatever it's called.\n\nOn the drive home, she kept bringing up negative topics any chance she got. During all these she called my fianc\u00e9e a slut and a whore. She said that my fianc\u00e9e \"looked like someone who would sleep around.\" and just tried to disgrace her character. She then tried to convince me that my fianc\u00e9e was toxic and controlling (she wasn't) and that she must've been abusive because she was driving a wedge between me and my family. It hurt me to even think that fianc\u00e9e was abusive when she did nothing but care about me and was tender and loving to me.\n\nWhen I was talking about how smart and beautiful my fianc\u00e9e was, she kept saying I was smarter and prettier than my fianc\u00e9e which just made me feel incredibly crappy. Sometimes, she would then have these strange mood swings where she would say \"If I could, I would kill myself so [fianc\u00e9e] could be alive. That's what you really want, don't you?\" and when she would ask that, she would demand and answer and I just didn't know how to answer and I would end up crying harder. She also kept trying to say she knows what I'm going through and I have to toughen up but she married the first person she ever dated, so she never even went through a breakup before.\n\nShe would also continuously joke (?) about how she was going to buy me a blow up doll and dress her in my fianc\u00e9e's clothes and it just made me feel so sick and uncomfortable and terrible when she would make that joke. She still makes that joke and now has my dad in on it.\n\nWhen we got home, I thought I was going to stay with my grandparents (70s M/F) but my mom informed me that I would have to stay with her or my sister (20 F) because I might have the Coronavirus and she wouldn't want me to give it to my grandparents, who currently have my emotional support cat at their house because my parents and sister both have dogs. My childhood best friend (20 F) also came over to stay with me for a couple weeks (which is a blessing) but she only feels comfortable staying with my parents because my sister doesn't take good care of her house. So, I'm currently at my parents house.\n\nAnyway, the day I got home, I went to my sister's house for a little bit to get away from my parents but my dad just ended up calling me on my phone and screaming at me that I only have a week (starting from Friday) to cry and get over it, then I would have to work and not be seen moping around or upset about it again. He also continued to call my fianc\u00e9e a selfish bitch and told me that I needed to forget about her and get on with my life. This made me just break down. I called my \"mother in law\" (for lack of better term) and just cried to her about everything and I think she really doesn't like my parents now. But, she told me that they are just trying to make me feel better by treating this like a breakup. My fianc\u00e9e's family is extremely religious (but accepting) and so they believe that like people need to be with their blood families to heal, so I think they're just having a difficult time understanding how my parents could be so mean but they're starting to understand every time I talk to them about it. However, they're on the other side of the country and there is nothing they can do about it now anyway other than listen when I call them. My parents don't want me to call them because they say that her family needs to grieve and I'm bothering them so now I'm really worried I'm just bothering her parents.\n\nI also made it clear to my parents that I'm changing my last name to hers because that was our plan when we got married and it was important to me still and at first, when I told them on the phone a few days after she passed, they seemed okay with it but now that I'm here, they're throwing a huge dramatic show about it. They keep screaming about it and telling me that I can't change my name to a slut's name and that nobody would love me if I changed my name to hers and I'm just so worried that maybe they're right but I feel like it's necessary.\n\nMy parents' dog also has been growling at me every day because I'm new to him (they got him while I was gone and living with my fianc\u00e9e) and my dad today yelled at me to stop \"moping around\" so the dog will stop growling at me because he thinks the dog growls at me due to my coldness or something. I don't know. I ended up breaking down in the shower because it's the only place I can be alone anymore (my room doesn't have a door) and I desperately miss my fianc\u00e9e and the life we made together. \n\nI'm ashamed that I'm 22 and am living with my parents right now and I'm just depressed and anxious and scared. None of my coping mechanisms I have learned from my depression and anxiety therapist have worked and I don't know what to do anymore. \n\nWhat can I do to make my parents more empathetic and caring? I've always been somebody who just needs to be held and told sweet things to when bad stuff happens to make me feel okay again but they're just making everything worse. When I talk to them they just shrug it off. One time, I asked my mom if she could be nicer to me and she said \"I am being nicer than usual.\" I don't know what to do anymore. I just need to know what to tell them so they stop all this and become kind and sweet and consoling. I just need it and her family knew I needed it but they, for some reason, don't understand. I've been hugged and cuddled more by my once to-be in-laws than by my own parents after all this happened. Please tell me what to do to get them to understand and treat me better. Or just tell me what I should do. I don't know anymore. I'm struggling.\n\nThank you for reading, sorry for the long post. Please leave your suggestions of what I should do below. I can't keep the tears in much longer.",

            "There is nothing you can do to change them. You need to cut them off.\n\nDo anything you possibly can to get out of this living situation. Move in with your sister, ask if your fiance's family will take you in, stay with a friend, etc. \n\nI am so sorry for your loss.",

            "Holy shit. I've been reading this sub for 6 years and this is the worst story I've read so far. OP, you write this undramatically--almost objectively--as if you're used to this? I think you've experienced so much abuse that your normal-meter is off, but you should know that this is absolutely NOT normal or okay.\n\nYour parents are despicable people. Like truly, truly vile humans. You can't teach people how to be empathetic or be a good person. I can't believe they're telling you to get over it when your entire future came crashing down. Please know that you're allowed to be in bed for as long as you need, even if it's 6 months. And I think you need to cut them out of your life permanently, but you can cross that bridge later. For now, please go anywhere but with them. I know being alone right now is hard but you need to leave. You said your friend came over to stay with you - can you go stay with her? What about a cousin, aunt, or uncle? Or do you have any other friends? They don't have to be best friends, just friends. This is that ONE time in your life where you can and should use your lifeline. If your friend told you this story, you'd do the same for them, right?\n\nYou can also google your city + \"lesbian shelter\" or \"LGBT shelter\". Even if you don't end up staying there, please call them. They can direct you to free or cheap therapy or an LGBT grief support group. Also read Option B by Sheryl Sandberg - it's about her grief in the days and months following the sudden death of her husband, and I think it could really help you see that you're not alone.\n\nAlso, I went through your post history and I just wanted to say that your fiancee looks like she had a beautiful, vibrant soul. I am so, so sorry for your unbearable pain. Just take it one breath at a time and give yourself as much time as you need before you go back to real life.",
            "i couldnt even finish reading this. as a fellow lesbian, i could not COMPREHEND having to deal with parents like this when you are trying to heal from such a traumatic event. \n\ni am so, so sorry about your fianc\u00e9e. how absolutely devastating. i hope you can get out of that environment and get therapeutic help to really heal from this.",
            "Got about two paragraphs in and couldn't read any more. You need to get out, immediately. Find anyone else to stay with, I'm sorry I can't think of more helpful options, but you HAVE to leave and cut them off. You do not need this right now, or ever. Tell your gf's parents what's happening to you there, reach out for support. This is fucking madness. I'm so sorry, OP.",
            "I agree with the first commenter. I\u2019m so sorry that this is happening to you, and there is absolutely no excuse for your family\u2019s horrible and ABUSIVE behavior. You need to find somewhere else to stay immediately. Although it will be stressful, the sooner you can get out the better. I would ask if your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family can take you in or if they know of someone who can. You need to get out now. Supplement the cost of living with that person by helping them out around the house, cleaning, doing chores or errands, etc. or if you\u2019re still working, then pay them something until you can move out on your own. I\u2019m so so sorry for your loss. Remember that grief isn\u2019t something you just get over, and you will never full heal from this. But you can hopefully make your situation easier by cutting off people who abuse you.",

There is nothing to feel ashamed of\u2026 This is the roughest thing you\u2019ve ever had to go through. You just do the best you can.

            "[deleted]",
            "First, so very very very sorry for what you are going through.  I cannot even imagine what it must be like for you, but I certainly understand that it's horrible.  My heart goes out to you.  I wish I could give you a real hug, but I hope you'll accept a virtual one.  And if you like it can last 30 minutes (or even longer if you wish).\n\n\\>>What can I do to make my parents more empathetic and caring? \n\nLook, I really hate to be Debby Downer in this situation which is terrible enough already.  But I'll ask you, with love, to reflect for a moment on that question.  Again, I hope I don't come across as cold, but why are you thinking in these terms?  Why, if your parents are being cruel and unloving to you, are you thinking that **you** need to do something different?  Your parents may have many wonderful qualities, and it's lovely that they drove out and packed up for you, but as far as helping with your grief and loss go, they are a\\*\\*holes.  They are just **not good people** in this respect. They are making it about them, being narcissistic, and unable to imagine or even respect what you are going through.  **The problem is not within you.  It's within them.**\n\nYou have good insight into your own personality and needs.  It's clear your parents will never be able to meet those needs.  That is a hurtful thing, and it's something you may need to grieve about.  But no matter how painful a situation is (and yours is over-the-top painful), it can only be made worse by not living in reality.  Expecting or hoping that your parents will become helpful in the grief process is not living in reality.  I'm sorry, honestly, to tell someone in your situation to take on any more responsibility, but if you choose to live in reality you will realize that as long as you are around them you can't get your needs met.\n\nIf you can possibly move out, do so.\n\nIf not, you need to find other resources.  Call your local crisis line and ask about grief support groups.  See a therapist.  If in doubt, also see a psychiatrist and see whether you would benefit from meds.  If you have any religious feeling at all, find a church which has a grief group.  Do whatever you need to do to find a place where you can have your needs met - where people will listen, love you, support you.\n\nAs far as your parents are concerned, google 'grey rock.'  Get up in the morning and tell yourself \"today my parents are going to say more horrible and insensitive things.  I expect this.  It's as certain as the sun rising.  I won't be unrealistic and expect or hope that they can be kind and loving. They can't.  But I will try to accept their unkindness as a fact, like the sun rising, and not be disappointed by it.\"\n\nI am so sorry.  I am so sorry.  If anything I said is the least bit helpful, fine.  If not, ignore it completely.  Please accept another long, heartfelt, virtual hug.  Very best wishes to you.",

To be completely honest,  I would walk out and never speak to them again. I do want to say I've remained close with my late boyfriend's family and its very important to both of us. Don't let your family make you think you're a burden to her family.\n\nI'm not sure where you're located, but if you'd like to PM me I'd love to help as much as I'm able. Even if its just to talk, please feel free to reach out to me. I have never wanted to reach through the internet and hug someone as much as I do right now.

            "This has to be one of the hardest posts I've ever had to read...\n\nI'm so sorry about your losing your fiancee. This has to be tough.\n\nYou're parents, though, are only making it harder on you. They demand you should only grieve for a week. They sound as though they're blaming your fiancee for your being gay. Your mom rants on and on, saying disparaging things about your fiancee...\n\nI could go on, but you're living it. And this is horrible and abusive. You need to GTFO of there immediately so you can grieve without being told you're not allowed. \n\nIf there is anywhere you can go, then go as fast as your feet will carry you. Follow that up with blocking your parents from any form of contact. No one needs this in their life, particularly on the heels of you losing the love of your life.\n\nJust get out and never speak to them again.\n\nGood luck with all of this. I'm just gobsmacked parents would do this to one of their children.",
            "Look. Everyone is saying to get out of your house. Which you should try to do. However with coronavirus and the fact that a horrible life changing thing has just happened to you\u2014that might not currently be possible. So I want to share a few pieces of advice. \n\n1. Stop telling your parents how you feel about any of it. Do not share any more with them about changing your name. Change your last name to your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s last name! If that is what feels right to you, honor it. There is nothing wrong with it, and someone some day is going to love you again no matter what your last name is. \n\n2. When your parents say anything about your fianc\u00e9e, do not respond. If they say more hurtful things or try to make you respond, do not take the bait. Responding will just make them continue. \n\n3. Your mother is making this about her. She seems narcissistic and cruel. The things that your mother is saying about your fianc\u00e9e only reflect who your mother is. She did not know your fianc\u00e9e the way that you did. Anything she says will not lessen the person your fianc\u00e9e was, or the beautiful relationship that you shared.\n\n4. You are going through horrible grief. So is your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents. If reaching out to them feels right, or makes you feel any better\u2014please continue to do it. If you can speak about this with your best friend or your sister, you should do that also.\n\nThere is no set timeline for healing. This is hard. I\u2019m sorry you have to go through it not only without your parents support, but even worse\u2014with them antagonizing you. \n\nJust know that you have every right to take your time with the healing process. Do not let anyone push you to move on. Take your time. Take walks. Take showers to be alone. Make sure you eat something every day and drink more water than you\u2019re drinking. Call your best friend. And turn to reddit if you need to vent. You can message me if you ever need to talk to someone.",
            "Bloody hell.  Get out of there, now.  You're grieving.  You lost your loved one 14 days ago.  NO ONE in their right mind should expect you to be your normal self 14 days after the loss of someone you loved.  You're still grieving.  OK with corona virus going the grandparents probably isn't the best idea.  But can you go anywhere else?  For your safety/sanity?  You need time to grieve, seriously.",
            "Oh my goodness your parents suck. Like so bad. I could barely read this. If you have anywhere else you can go, please do so. Your parents are incredibly abusive. I am so sorry for your loss too. I can't imagine what you are going through. You need support right now so please seek out therapy, there are great online places you can use.",
            "If you can\u2019t get out of their house stop engaging with their negativity and get a door for your room.   \n  \nYou are not safe there with their dog. Your parents are emotionally abusive. They are trying to cruelly make you \u201cget over it\u201d like death is the same thing as a breakup. Once you accept that they are shallow and incapable of comprehending grief then you can emotionally cut them off. You wouldn\u2019t accept this treatment from a stranger so why would you accept it from people who supposedly love you. They are narcissists and not capable of learning empathy so don\u2019t bother trying to teach them right now. That conversation could happen in some years but you need to put yourself first before their adult education.",

Move away from the toxic parents for the time of your grief. \n\nNo words will make this better and all the generic condolences and encouragements feel empty and useless but all I can say is: grief counselling helps, look ahead and remember the bad times like the good ones. Eventually you will \u201clet her go\u201d. I don\u2019t think the slight pinch in your heart when thinking of her will ever leave but it will change the emotions that you feel concerning these events. Take care of yourself first and do not let others tell you how to live your grief. Accept a helping hand but do not listen to people who tell you to \u201cget over it\u201d, they have clearly never had a loss of this kind. \n\nIf you want to talk, my DMs are open.",
            "Your parents are bad people. You can\u2019t fix bad people with emotional appeals.

They are making no effort to conceal their contempt for you. This is the best you\u2019re going to get, and it\u2019s miserable. My advice to you is to reach out to your in-laws. Your parents\u2019 assertion that you\u2019re \u201cbothering\u201d them is self-serving, and you shouldn\u2019t trust it. Reach out to them and express your sincere gratitude for their comfort and support. Explain the situation at home (you need not go into detail, only that your parents have been incredibly cold and unsupportive) and ask if perhaps they could use someone to help them with cooking and household chores for a little while, just to ease the load. You\u2019d love to visit them if they\u2019re open to having you and you\u2019d be more than happy to share warm memories of their daughter with them when they feel ready. \n\nIf that doesn\u2019t pan out for whatever reason, reach out to friends. Literally anyone who might give you a break from this onslaught. Your parents are treating you so, so abhorrently and I\u2019m amazed you\u2019ve lasted this long without totally losing it.

You can not \"make\" other people be who they aren't. You parents are selfish, homophobic, and honestly kind of assholes. They will not change. The only thing you can control is you.

What your parents are doing is some of the most abusive behavior I have ever heard. What they are doing to you is on purpose.

Do you not have any friends from back there? If you can, I would at least try and move back temporarily until you can make a plan.

I\u2019m here for you, I care about you, I\u2019m SO so sorry you are going through all of this, you need a lifeline and I think I can provide one for you. I will do absolutely everything in my power to help to see you through this in a *safe* environment, with *tons* or support, on your own timeline. Nobody gets to tell you how to grieve, or for how long. Grief is love with nowhere to go, and you clearly had a tremendous amount of love between you. This will not be easy and it will not be quick. I need you to know that is okay. Your feelings are okay, whatever and whenever they are, they are yours, they are valid, and you have every right to feel them in whatever shape they take and for however long they last. The only way out is through. If you see this please, please reach out to me. If nothing else, if I\u2019m right, and we are even reasonably close, I will come to where you are and share with you some of the warmth, compassion, kindness, acceptance and love that you are so deserving of. If you need some family right now, I will do my best. I have raised three beautiful biological children, two chosen kiddos, my oldest daughter is a lesbian, and I am bi. I see you, and I want you to know that you are beautiful, just as you are, and that you have my unconditional support of you would like to have it. I truly hope to hear from you.

See what you can do (when you are feeling up to it, you need to grieve) to get a job and get away from your parents.

            "My dear, sweet girl. My heart is breaking for you even more. I saw your beautifully touching post of her playing music from Amelie a couple of days ago, and that brought me to tears. To read this now and know of the horrific abuse and mistreatment you are getting from the people who are supposed to love, cherish and protect you makes typing this even harder through the tears. I'm a Mom of 4 -28F, 26M, 25M, and 14F (one of who is also LGBTQ) and I cannot imagine ever treating my kids or anyone else I love in such a cruel manner. Hell, I wouldn't treat my ex-husband or his wife like that, and I despise the two of them. I don't have any confidence in anything you could do that would change their thoughts or behavior. Vile people will remain vile, no matter what you do honey. Your best bet would be to reach out to a trusted therapist for ways to better manage your grief. After that, you should try to find an alternative to staying with your parents. If possible, could you get tested for COVID-19 and then stay with your grandparents if/when you get a clean bill of health? Hell, if you were anywhere near me, I'd have a place for you! \n\nPlease try to stay strong for your fiancee's memory and reach out for help. Research any possible resources you can get - mental health and grief counseling, housing assistance, financial aid, etc. If you need help finding out what's available for you, I am a wiz at tracking down information and would be happy to help!!

They cared about their daughter, and it sounds like they care about you and who you are a lot more than your birth parents do.",
            "My heart is aching for you, stranger. I've never been in love, so I can't imagine the pain of losing someone that I planned to spend my life with and especially at such a young age and so very suddenly. I know what grief is. I've lost a parent, so I can tell you that I understand what it's like to miss the life you had before. I know what it's like to wake up in a panic. And I'm sorry. I am so sorry that you're going through this.\n\nYour mother is a narcissist. That's not an insult. She thinks the world revolves around her and her wants, and she never learned how to really give someone else what they need, so she's giving you what she wants to give you, and \"fuck your feelings.\" Your father has no empathy for you, and clearly has no idea what mourning is really like. Healing takes so much time. It was at least a year after my dad before I started feeling like myself again, and even then, I've never been the same.\n\nYou can't get your parents to care more. You are their kid. You lost your fianc\u00e9e and they are still treating you and her memory like absolute shit. You can make people who are that callous more empathetic. All you can do, at this point, is set boundaries. If they won't allow you to set boundaries or it is unsafe for you to do so, you move in with your sister. And as soon as you can find a living situation away from your family, you move the hell out and go no-contact with them. They are poisonous for you.\n\nIF you can safely set boundaries, the key is to be respectful but firm. The second your mother starts insulting your fianc\u00e9e, you tell her \"The way you speak about the woman I planned to spend my life with is insulting, and it hurts me. Please be respectful or I will not continue this conversation.\" If she refuses to stop, you leave the room. If your dad tells you to \"get over it\" again, you tell him \"That's not how grief works, and I understand that you think that I shouldn't hurt over someone that you didn't care about, but I am not healing on your timeline. Please give me more love, respect, and patience than this. If you can't do that, I am not continuing this conversation.\" If he refuses, you leave the room. Simply don't allow them to speak to you like this. Their narcissism and homophobia are preventing them from seeing your pain as real or worthy of compassion. You can't fix that. You can only try to control how you allow them to speak to you.",

            "It\u2019s not often a post on here really affects me, but I can\u2019t even imagine how you\u2019re feeling right now. This must be incredibly taxing on you. I\u2019m very sorry for everything from the first word of your post to the last.\n\nI think it\u2019s been said and I\u2019ll also agree: your mother is abusive. I can\u2019t tell if your father is as well or if he just enables your mother while exhibiting some of her behaviors. I\u2019m not a professional, but her comments are clearly manipulative. At first, I could see her comments as very misplaced anxious thoughts and fears about you, your life choices and your current situation in life. But once I got to that blow up doll and kill herself instead comments it became very clear that she\u2019s trying to manipulate you. She\u2019s trying to circle this back to her being the victim. She would be behaving like a better mother if she never said a word to you since you got home rather than to say the things she\u2019s hurting you with now.\n\nThe only thing your parents may be right about is living with your grandparents now. I\u2019m not sure how long you\u2019ve been quarantined for and how long everyone else has, but they are at a very high risk. So if you decide to stay there, please make sure you\u2019ve taken all the precautionary measures.\n\nCan you stay with your friend or your sister? Losing a loved one is one of the hardest things to face in life. You need space to breathe. The shower should never be your only personal space. Where f did they put your door? It\u2019s so far from okay that they won\u2019t at least be quiet and give you space if they\u2019re not going to say comforting things.\n\nThey\u2019re wrong. You know it and we know it. So don\u2019t take anything they\u2019re saying seriously. You know the person your fianc\u00e9e was. You know her parents. Not them. Use your judgement. Also, the best way to deal with your mother is not to give in to her manipulative tactics. You don\u2019t have to fight with her either. You just steer away, answer minimally or shut it down. Whatever fits. If she says a comment like the kill herself instead comment, absolutely don\u2019t engage in that.\n\nI wish I could help you more. But the best thing for you now is to get away physically and mentally from them. Shut them out of your head and treat it like your mom is mentally unstable. Nothing she says is reality.",

            "I am 2 years older than your mother, and I wasn\u2019t fortunate enough to have children, but the way your parents treat you is disgusting.  The only advice I have besides finding away to leave and cut them off completely, which you really should, is to stand up for yourself.  The next time they say anything that hurts you, tell them exactly how you feel and that they are to stop treating you that way and to stop talking about your fianc\u00e9 that way.  The shock factor of you standing your ground with them might shut them up, but even if it doesn\u2019t, you did something good for yourself and your fianc\u00e9.  \n\nI have a simple motto that if you always do what\u2019s good, then only good can come from it (even if it doesn\u2019t seem that way initially). It\u2019s from all the yoga training I\u2019ve taken which included tons of reading.  It sounds silly, but it has really helped me.  Anyway, I wish I could hug you. I can feel your pain in your words.  Find other ways to comfort yourself.  Comfort from other humans isn\u2019t the only way.  Yoga, meditation, music, art, dance, nature, books, posting here to all of us :)...  If you want any recommendations on books, let me know.  \n\nI\u2019m so sorry about your fianc\u00e9.

That\u2019s your mum projecting - she is the person that embodies these traits, not your fianc\u00e9e. Your dad, at the very least, is enabling her. At worst, he shares those traits too.\n\nI know that making plans to leave their home right now is hard. You\u2019re grieving, and at the same time, the world has gone crazy.

            "There was a really powerful reply to a post about domestic violence I\u2019m going to borrow from here - because your parents are actively abusing you, and the original person\u2019s advice applies. \n\nShe was trying to leave her abuser, but was stuck until things were ready (finances, logistics, safety, etc.). She went deep into survival mode and played her abuser\u2019s games - agreed with everything they said, did everything they asked, responded how they wanted to see her respond, making it seem like she was 100% fully devoted to their miserable shit. What she was actually doing was keeping her head down and staying alive until she could get the fuck out. She wrote about how it really did fuck with her head, because abusive people are master manipulators - she would tell herself the truth and go through her plan over and over again until she could get free, and still the abuse made her doubt herself.  Abusive shitheads really out here making YOU feel like the crazy one, like reality is actually their fucked up version, and everything you know deep down inside is wrong. So I\u2019m not suggesting that this route is at all the easy way. \n\nBut if you are stuck in their house until you can get cleared for your grandparents (and have those conversations with them only, don\u2019t let your parents convince you that it\u2019ll never be safe to move there), the game plan becomes 100% about survival. They have more than proven that there is no common ground or place of understanding. They, and I can\u2019t stress this enough, are not people to trust or believe in. They are hateful, hurtful, and actively dangerous for you to be around. \n\nI\u2019m so deeply sorry for your loss, for your life to be thrown upside down in the worst imaginable way - and to be surrounded by the worst possible people. I hope you can get out, the sooner the better - wishing you love and light.",

Also, as someone who lost the person most dear to me, I know memories are malleable and fragile. The absolute LAST thing you need is your parents distorting and breaking all the good, happy memories your fiancee has left you to remember her by.\n\nSo checking yourself into a reputable (make sure you do your research) inpatient program might be exactly what you need.

I\u2019m sure that comforting you is cathartic for them as well.

I know things probably feel muddled and confusing and overwhelming right now, and it\u2019s hard to know what is true and right and best. Your parents are taking advantage of that.

I'm here for you if you'd like, I may be a stranger, but we're sisters in pain.\n\n2. You cannot make someone feel empathy. The optimist in me wants to say that maybe they just don't know how to deal with it. My mother made the mistake of telling me \"well you're lucky that you didn't get married before he deployed, at least you're not a widow now!\" Not a good thing to say and it hurt me, but to her it came from a good place. Her intentions weren't mean. However, that being said, don't let yourself be abused because that's what it sounds like is happening and no one deserves that treatment. \n\n3. Your sexuality has nothing to do with any of this. Don't let your parents hatefulness and homophobia rip you apart. Your value has nothing to do with anything else. I'm sure you know this but I wanted to make sure someone told you that today. You are precious and loved. \n\n4. My recommendation is to leave your parents house. Can you stay with your friend and ignore your parents for a while? I know it's hard with the lockdowns and everything but I don't think it's healthy to deal with all of that on top of the pain that you're already dealing with. I suggest that you think really hard and maybe even consider cutting ties with some of your family, specifically your parents. That may sound drastic but you'll be surprised how much more peaceful life is without toxicity and hate. It's time to be selfish, Love, do what you need to do and focus on you for a bit.\n\nRegardless of what else you do, I think you should totally change your last name to hers. If that makes you feel like you're more connected to her, then it sounds like a great way to honor her. Just don't let it prevent you from living again in the future.

In that time they\u2019ve mentioned angrily that \u201che got what he deserved for doing cocaine in the first place\u201d. They also brought up that I clearly have a drinking problem because just after he died when they came to see me I ordered a beer at brunch.

I can't even begin to imagine your heartbreak.\n\nThere's no shame in living with family at age 22. Firstly, parents are supposed to be our support network and having just had one of the most terrible bereavements a person can experience, it is in fact normal that you would stay with people who are supposed to love you, care for you and watch over you. I'm in my 30s and when I was ill my parents begged me to come stay with them (I couldn't because I work in a different country, but if not for that I would've). It's unthinkable that you should be alone while dealing with this kind of trauma.\n\nNow... I say this as a queer person myself whose parents are also deeply homophobic: your parents are being un-think-ably AWFUL. Your mother may \"not want my daughter to be a lesbian\" but to torment and abuse your child in their time of profound grief is a level of inhumanity I can't comprehend. You need to get out of there asap. Your fianc\u00e9e wouldn't want you to be going through this. She would want you to be looked after and cared for at a time of such grief - not being piled on by people who are supposed to care for you. \n\nI would suggest looking up your local organisations for LGBTQ support or domestic abuse. Please please please call them. Call your grandparents as well. Or your sister. Just literally anyone you know in the area - you need to stay somewhere else. If coronavirus is a concern, it may be that you can self-isolate somewhere until 14 days have passed since you were last in your usual city/state and then came move in with your grandparents (if they are supportive). \n\nKeep in touch with your in laws. They sound like wonderful people and they can also understand your grief right now.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to say, other than... I really feel for you and you absolutely must get away from your parents.",
            "Get out, please. Stay with your friend or maybe with your sister. You could help her around the house in exchange for room and board as you heal. The abuse you are suffering right now is going to be with you quite a while as is. Please, as someone that has been abused a lot, take any option you can short of living on the streets or hurting yourself.\n\nYou went through something I couldn\u2019t even imagine. Please stay strong. I\u2019m available to talk if you ever need for emotional support.\n\nAlso do not be ashamed for living with your folks at 22.",
            "People are providing a lot of very helpful tips and solutions in these comments. I just wanted to say I'm incredibly sorry for your loss and that even though I'm just an internet stranger, I'm sending so much love to you right now. I couldn't imagine the type of pain you're in and how hard it must be to cope with this. Just know someone believes in you and has a huge internet hug for you",
            "First of all, I\u2019m so so sorry that you\u2019re going through this. I was 22 when I lost my husband and he was the same age as your fianc\u00e9e so in that aspect of things I have been in your shoes. However, my parents were amazing during that time. They went over the top to make sure I had support and everything I needed. The way your parents are acting is totally unacceptable and disgusting. This will most likely be the worst situation you ever experience, there\u2019s no need to make it worse by being around people who don\u2019t support you and help you through your grief. Get out of there ASAP if you can. I truly feel awful for you and if you ever need an ear to listen, I\u2019m here for you.",
            ">What can I do to make my parents more empathetic and caring?\n\nNothing.  They are fundamentally broken and nothing short of psychiatric intervention could even have a hope of getting them to change.  You need to get out of your parent's house *now*, whether that means going to your sister's or with your best friend or driving back to stay with your in-laws, or even just getting a hotel.  Don't stay there any longer and block your parents from calling or texting you.  You can't grieve and heal with them around.",

I don't have a ton of disposable income,  but I would be willing to pay for a few nights (3-4) at a hotel for you if there is one accepting bookings. I can do them in a lump or spread apart if you think that would be better for your sanity. I'm not sure if that would fit into your isolation plan since it is moving locations, but perhaps some other Redditors would be willing to chip in using accumulated hotel points or money. This is a devastating situation and you and the life your soon-to-be wife shared together is worth so much more than the treatment your family has shown you. I'm so sorry. If hotels aren't taking bookings, let me know if I can support any self-care habits that bring you peace from afar.",

            "Your parents are awful, horrible abusers who are destroying your self esteem in order to control you. They're trying to break you down in order to make you into what they want you to be. Your parents tried to act like they were saving you and taking care of you, but they were just pouncing on the opportunity to take advantage of your tragedy to bring you back into their fold and browbeat you into being what they think you should be.\n\nThere's nothing you can do or say to keep them from being evil. That's who they are, and it isn't your fault. There's nothing wrong with you. Your reactions are absolutely normal. You are not lazy. You are grieving a terrible loss. Your fiancee's parents were acting how loving parents should act.\n\nThe only thing you should focus on now is GETTING OUT OF THERE. I realize this is hard given everything that's going on right now and the grief you are experiencing, but whatever energy you have left should go into that. Find a friend with a room. Go back to your fiancee's parents if they can take you in. Find other relatives that you could stay with. Get an apartment with a girlfriend. But do whatever you can to get away from your evil, toxic, horrifying parents.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss. I hope things turn around for you soon.",
            "My parents would have done the same thing if my fiancee had died when I was your age. Their reasoning would have been that if they made the experience as negative as possible, I would never have wanted to be with a woman again. \n\nFocus if you can on just getting out. You cannot mourn or heal in this situation. You will have deeper trauma from the way they are treating you. And you cannot change them. That is not possible.\n\nYou can write to me if you want - I'm older than your parents, but I lived with and survived parents like that. It gets better.",
            "I'm late to this, and though I've been on the receiving end of some familial homophobia my self it's never been anything like on the scale of these monsters you have for a family.\n\nI don't have much in the way of advice, other than to suggest you find *anywhere* else to be and never look or go back, but I wanted to point something out that I really hope you're picking up from these comments, /u/lesbianpearls: there are hundreds of complete strangers in this thread who care more about your physical and emotional wellbeing than these members of your family, to the point where some of them (myself included) would offer to help pay for you to get out and take care of yourself. That's how bad your situation is, and how urgently you need to put yourself first.",

            "Hey op, I'm gonna start this off by offering you my condolences. What you are going through, especially in such a chaotic time is horrid. I also want you to know that you don't deserve to be treated like this. Your folks need to understand that you were born this way and you aren't going to change. And I would leave and go nc for awhile to let them think about that, possibly even permanently. You need to leave them for your self esteem as well as your mental health. Don't let anyone rush you into moving on, since the only person who can sort through your feelings is YOU. I'd also advise you to see a grief counselor, since talking to someone helps a lot. I hope things start to look up for you soon, and know that there are still people who care about you out there.",
            "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. You need to move away from your parents and cut off all contact - maybe not forever, but at least for awhile. It seems like they\u2019re just unable to move past your sexual orientation, which is sad and close minded of them, and also suggests they are too stubborn to change their view on it anytime soon.

You deserve better, and you need to leave.\n\nI don't have any resources to share, but I truly hope you can find somewhere safe and accepting, where you can find solace and mourn your love in a healthy environment.

Secondly, you're parents are genuinely horrible people for what they are doing to you. You lost the love of your life. It is NOT a breakup. It is real life trauma. You need and DESERVE time to grieve, work through your pain, and process your emotions. Regardless of their ass backwards beliefs, the least they can do is allow you to grieve your fiancee. I would leave and cut contact. Forever. I know covid is an issue, but this is emotional abuse of the worst kind, and no one deserves that, let alone after losing a loved one.

You just can\u2019t. You\u2019re a beautiful soul by your willingness to see the good in them, by forgiving their actions and trying you to change or fix them but you can\u2019t fix them.

You need to deal with things on your own. You don\u2019t need your parents okay? What they did and continue to do to you is toxic and will never be something that you deserved. For now try to mentally block them or if you can\u2019t, remember that nothing they say is true or right. Continue to survive one day at a time or even one hour at a time if you need to and do your best to act \"normal\u00a0\" so they can\u2019t threaten to put you in a mental hospital. They won\u2019t do it, it\u2019s just to scare you. You\u2019re an adult and go look for your rights online depending where you live. It will tell you if you could be restrained against your will or not in a hospital and for how long. Delete your history after and search random thing after to show that you do have an history. \nI would leave my phone on voice recording in your pocket or in your bookshelf between books or under your bed under a shirt or something so they couldn\u2019t see the lights on if you have a notification. You could constantly record what they say and delete it in the bathroom with headphone afterward? It will give you proof if something happens. \n\n\nYour parents who are supposed to be loving and caring are abusers but NEVER believe them that you deserve their reproach. You don\u2019t. \n\nYou can do this, you\u2019re strong enough, you asked for advices and you when through all of this, it shows that you\u2019re strong.

I am sure she would want you to be happy and safe,so why not to grant her wishes? Find a place where you could find some peace, find a job/profession that you love, find people who would support you and understand your tough journey.

Even if I'd needed to leave that apartment, I can't imagine willingly going with people who never respected my fiance or our relationship.   \nPlease get out OP.

Grieving is not time-sensitive, everyone grieves differently and anything that hinders or interferes with that process can cause long-term irreparable damage and trauma. Please do yourself a favor and do something to get out of there...anything.  It may also be a good idea to cut your parents off for a while and explain why in a letter. They will try to reach out to you and turn it around and make you seem like the bad guy, but you don't owe an explanation beyond your letter. \n\nMaybe also check out /r/raisedbynarcissists.

You should seriously leave your parents' house immediately. They are hateful ,bitter people, and they resent you for not being as bitter and hateful, and for being different. They will not show any improvement for you any time soon.\n\nI'm sorry. Hang in there. You are stronger than you know. Your friends and your support circle will strengthen you",

Things really suck right now. But you don't deserve this.\n\n\nAlso depending on your area's laws recording things on your cell phone can help. Even just to send to your in laws to help them understand what is going on. It's especially helpful if your parents ever threaten to physically hurt you to start recording, ideally they back off.

You can't control other people's behavior, only your own, and you've done everything you could by asking them to stop and to change their behavior.\n\nThe only thing you can control is what YOU do.

Your parents clearly have a lot of problems with your decision to marry her and that DOES NOT reflect on you or your worth as a person. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but their lack of empathy and love in the aftermath of this situation is unacceptable.\n\nThe grief, depression and pain you are feeling are indicative of the fact that you are not in a safe place.

Every nasty word, every cold comment, every raised voice... that is a CHOICE they make. They have been adults your whole life, and everything they have done and every way they have behaved has been their choice. It has had nothing to do with you, just like now, they're choosing their behavior.\n\nIf you think there's some magic words or way you can tell them you need them to be kind to you while you grieve... honey there isn't. No normal, decent, reasonable person needs to be told to be kind to someone who has just lost someone they love. Your parents are shitty people, and that's nothing that you can change. They have always been shitty people, they will always be shitty people. You deserve SO much better... but you won't get it from them.\n\nAs soon as you can, get out of that environment.

            "Get away from your parents. Your parents sound like narcissists. Remember she will always be with you. She will always be watching you. Just take deep breaths. Maybe find a roommate ( maybe male) so you won\u2019t feel like your moving on fast ( sorry I\u2019m a straight female so I hope that didn\u2019t come off rude lol or move in with a girl best friend ) just please get away from your parents. Vent to your friends. Vent to your finances parents. People like your parents when you vent to them they are just going to turn it back on to you. You don\u2019t deserve that beautiful .",
            "Just get right over the idea that there's anything you can do to make your parents nicer to you - there's nothing you can do to make your parents behave like decent people, so you certainly can't make them behave like loving people. \n\nI'm very sorry you're going through all of this. You probably don't want to hear this, but I want to validate your feelings right now: your situation sucks, because your parents are behaving like hateful assholes. That doesn't mean they don't love you - I think they do, since they drove across the country to come and get you, but there's clearly something that prevents them from expressing it in a helpful manner. \n\nMy guess is that they really don't have any clue how to handle this, so they're pushing you to get over it out of some combination of fear for you and wanting their own discomfort to pass. \n\nThat doesn't matter, though - what matters is that you need to find coping strategies and an exit plan. \n\nSo, focus on your reactions to their behavior. Watch their behavior - are there specific triggers that bring out the abuse? If it happens every time you cry, for example, create a plan to avoid crying when they can see you (which includes seeing you run for privacy to cry), and create plans that allow you to have physical distance from them - going to the library to research job opportunities, or gardening, or anything that gets you away from them. Have space for healing, which probably requires space they're not in. \n\nThen, start planning your escape: what are your job prospects in the area? Do you have friends who might want roommates? How do you move out again? That should be a high priority, it sounds like. (Is your sister less problematic? That might be an interim solution.)\n\nFinally, I strongly recommend you find grief counseling. That sounds obvious, but it's also necessary. \n\nAnd a bonus recommendation: get out there and volunteer. For anything. You need three things right now: to get away from your parents as much as possible, to spend time around someone who is glad you're there, and something to do that takes you out of your head. Almost any volunteer opportunity will give you all of those. \n\nYou've been through a lot, and you're not getting the comfort and support you need. I'm very sorry about that. Your parents don't seem capable of being supportive, so you're going to have to be extra kind to yourself for a while. \n\nSending you my very best wishes, and my hope that things improve quickly. Peace be with you.",

            "Fellow queer woman here and I did skim the whole thing, and wow.. **get out of that house.**\n\n1. Your fiancee's family sound very nice, but they're wrong in one aspect: you do **not** need to be with your blood family to heal. Clearly their bond as a 'blood' family did some good and they accepted their daughter despite their religion (I assume). This is **not** the case with your family. The full quote of \"blood is thicker than water\" (kin/family bond is always going to be stronger than friendship or love bond) is \"blood of the covenant is thicker than water of the womb\", which means the exact opposite.\n2. Your mother is manipulative and so is your dad. This is **unacceptable** abuse -- as in literally you shouldn't be accepting this girl!-- they're **re-traumatizing** you with everything they say to you. Get out of that house!\n3. I'm 28 and still living with my parents. Don't be ashamed of what happened to you in your life to get you where you are. You **do need to get out of that house asap though**. I assume you live in America, and I've read before that there may be some women's shelter that you can look for in your area. If you could, I would see if you could live with a friend (or even your 'in-laws') for a period of time. If your grandparents are supportive, ask them if THEY are willing to house you-- ignore what your mom says (unless she can barge in at any time). Of course, where I'm from I'd also pay them rent or 'appreciation money', which depends on your financial situation and ability to work. \n4. I cannot stress this enough: you need to get out of that place and find a place to heal. You cannot do that when your environment and the people who surround you are abusive and manipulative (manipulate you into hearing all the hatred against your fiancee OR that you need to just 'get over it' -- these people are NOT here for you.)\n\nTL;DR: your parents are abusive and trying to manipulate you. Their behaviour is **not acceptable**. They are **re-traumatizing** you, which means you will get even further scarred by this event if you stay there (you cannot find a healthy way to digest and cope with this traumatic event in that environment, I assure you). **Get out of that house.** Plan, pack a knapsack, whatever.  Good luck. FWIW, I'm sorry this is happening to you stranger.",

I know times are hard and if you have to wait it out, do, but please, as soon as you can, get away. Cut them out. Blood does not entitled them to treat you this way. Birthing and raising you does not entitle them to treat you this way. Don't ever let them make you doubt yourself. They are wrong. They will never change and they will always be wrong. \n\nPlease please for the love of God take care of yourself. My heart aches for you and I wish there was more we could all do to help you.

These people sound like they bring so much pain and suffering to your life that it\u2019s just no longer worth keeping them in it.

Do not feel like you are obligated to put up with them because they\u2019re family, or maybe the \u201ckind\u201d things you can recall that they\u2019ve done in the last.

Being with your parents is not going to allow you to grieve properly and is just piling trauma on top of trauma. If your sister and friend are amenable maybe even have a day where you clean where you'll be staying, cleaning can be very therapeutic when going through a loss, in my opinion.\nOn a more personal note, I too lost my very long term partner at 22, he was 21 and it was a very sudden and unexpected death. Bereavement counselling helped me so much and I would recommend it to anyone struggling with a loss.\n\nThe few things that I found helped me in the first months were honestly just ways to distract myself. I went on a walk with our families, I made playlists of songs that I could listen to without crying, I did yoga, I baked and cooked... Anything that meant I was bodily tired as well as mentally exhausted so that I could actually sleep.\nBe gentle with yourself OP. Anyone who blames their loved one for grieving their fiancee is not worth your thoughts in this difficult time. This is about you, right now. It is NOT selfish. This is time for you to be sad and in pain, allow yourself to be.\nPlease give me a message if you need someone who has been somewhat in your position to talk to. Much love, OP. You are amazing.",

Make very clear to them that they are actively doing things that will cause you to cut them out of your life permanently. Ask them if they would be treating the death of a male fiance the same way? This is the sort of thing that causes the level of emotional trauma and resentment that will never make you want to speak to your parents again after all this. As calmly as you can, make sure they know that this will be the destruction of your relationship with them if this continues.

I am so incredibly sorry for you, this was your fianc\u00e9e,  she was so important to you and loved you so much, why can't they see that?  You need in all honesty a good shoulder to cry on because this won't go away for a long time. I just want you to know that you're made of tough stuff even though you may not think it. I couldn't imagine living with them if that's how they behave.  In terms of coping, I wish I had good advice,  you can get more counselling online as the world is in lockdown right now, contact and speak with your friends as often as you can and cry and vent as much as you can because it's gonna help.

            "Your parents aren\u2019t showing much empathy, and through minimizing your loss, they hope to distance themselves from having to deal with you having a female lover. You can\u2019t fix that. Their homophobia is engrained in their culture. \n\nYou can, however, stand up for yourself, but it will take some time. Get out your phone and voice record them when they are being abusive to you or to your fianc\u00e9\u2019s memory. When you have enough examples of this, then I would sit down with both of them and tell them that it isn\u2019t right for them to demean you and her in this way. \n\nExplain to them that if either of them were to die, and you said some of the things they\u2019ve said to you about her, they would be disgusted that you could demean someone they loved like that. \n\nOnly if you need to, play for them those demeaning comments. I would have the specific times in the audios noted so that when they deny, I could play it back. Sometimes people need to hear exactly what they said and how they said it, to realize how they really sound.\n\nIf they respond by accepting their behaviour then you may be on to some better behaviour from them. If they continue to deny/ignore, then that conversation is over. I would end the conversation then with something like \u201cWell, you can try to forget her, but I will not. And, one day there will be another woman who I will fall in love with, because that is who I am. It isn\u2019t her that you don\u2019t like, it is me loving and caring for another human being, who happens to be female. \u201c\n\nAs for changing your name, take a good long time to think this over. Yes, you were going to do that, had her death not preceded that. It is not a slight to her if you keep your name. You know that when the right person comes along for you, that you can take that opportunity to change your name, and that will be a real service to the memory of your first love. \n\nIf you were to have been the one who passed instead of your fianc\u00e9, would you want her to live in the past? Or, would you want her to remember all of your loving and caring moments and take them with her into a loving relationship with her new partner?\n\nWouldn\u2019t you want to see the woman you loved so much to come out of her loss as a whole person? One who lives her best life?  \n\nI think she would want that for you. Take care and all of the time you need to mourn your fianc\u00e9.",

Jake and his boyfriend \"Mike\" (who he had obviously not gotten into a fight with and was there) were infuriated and we all just sort of cried together for a while.\n\nThey stayed up with me almost all night helping me figure out my next moves. We all agreed that taking the high road was the best route. We made a list of all the things that were necessary to get out of the apartment. Mike is a property manager for a different apartment complex so this morning he called my property manager and gave her a very condensed, detail-free version of what was happening. I have always thought it important to get to know your property manager in case you ever have a situation where they can help you out, so she always really liked me. Dale and I have been paying rent on a month to month basis for about 3 months because we were starting to look for houses to purchase after we settled down after the wedding. My property manager told Mike that working out getting my name off of the rental agreement wouldn't be a problem and to not worry about the 30 day notice that she typically requires for a tenant moving out.\n\nAs far as finances go, I make about 70% of our combined income and Dale only covers about 30%. When Jake, Mike, and I were discussing the logistics of me moving out, Mike brought up the point that Dale does not make enough to cover the required 3x rent in income each month. Meaning he will most likely be given notice to move out if he cannot find a roommate fast. We lived in a one bedroom so I doubt he'll be able to find someone quickly who is willing to sleep on a couch versus having their own bedroom. Especially since I purchased the couch, so... there isn't even one there anymore. The thought of this brings me great pleasure, as I'm sure you can imagine.\n\nJake and I each called out of work today and we rented one of those mover pick up trucks. We were pretty organized after making our list and it only took us a couple of trips to get my stuff out and into Jake and Mike's garage for the time being.\n\nDale texted me a couple of times asking how Jake is and if I'm coming home after work tonight. I told him I'm already home (not exactly a lie, I was there at the time) and then I said Jake was going to be okay and that I just couldn't believe how awful people can be to the people they love. Dale agreed and said that he was glad he had such a \"good girl\" like me. It was tempting to say something about how yeah, I'm just so vanilla that way. I didn't, I just told him to always remember that, how great I am to him. He said of course he would. That felt pretty satisfying and I hope he does remember that everyday for the rest of his life.\n\nWhoever it was that posted about the vanilla ice cream idea, Jake, Mike, and I laughed about that hysterically last night. It was the first thing that made me laugh like that and may be the only thing for a while, so thank you for that.\n\nI didn't end up ruining any of Dale's stuff, I didn't print out the emails and send them to his family/friends, I didn't do anything destructive or spiteful. However, after all my stuff was out, Jake and I made a trip to the grocery store. I took that poster's advice and I bought one of those big plastic tubs of vanilla ice cream. I left it on the counter with a note and my engagement ring. I wrote \"I know vanilla isn't your favorite flavor, but this is the only vanilla you'll be eating from now on. XOXO\". I mean... I am human. I had to leave him with a little bit of a bang.\n\nSo here I am. Staying with Mike and Jake for a while. Finding an apartment will be no issue for me, I am comfortable financially on my own with a stable job. I have to deal with the deposits I put down for the venues for both the wedding and the reception. I can't right now, I'm too much of a mess emotionally. I will by the week's end though as I know I can't put it off any longer if there's any hope at all of getting refunded. I had already booked our honeymoon but I did pay the extra for insurance if the trip needed to be cancelled. I honestly don't really know what exactly the insurance covers, I'll have to look into it. Wether or not I can get a refund for Dale's ticket, I will be going on my first trip out of the country on my own and I am happy about this. It's one bright thing to look forward to through this whole mess.\n\nI will sell my wedding dress- which was a low cut dress by the way and showed my scar off as much as a wedding dress can. I guess Dale would have found that gross. Or maybe I'll burn it. Burning it sounds kind of fun because I've been holding back so much on not being destructive in a time where I would have found great (albeit temporary) pleasure in burning everything Dale has ever owned. Burning my dress is something I can do privately that will still be satisfying. I can scream and cry and throw rocks at it, pour lighter fluid all over it, watch it burn, and then cook a s'more over it. Because I love s'mores so why not?\n\nI am walking away from Dale with my head held high. The best revenge is to walk away as dignified as possible and to not sink to his level. I was close with his family but I'm not going to worry about what he tells them. I am positive it won't be the truth- there is no way he's got the balls and decency to tell them what he did. But *I* know what he did, *he* knows what he did, and all the people who truly love me and who I am close with will know what he did. That's all that really matters. Though it's nice to have those emails just in case Dale tries to take things too far or something. I'm going to be okay. I'm having one of my empowered moments. Though I just spent the last hour in the bathtub sobbing. Like I said, waves. Jake told me that Dale isn't worthy of my \"quirky\" nipple and I agree.\n\nWhen I got in my accident, I was lucky that the shrapnel didn't pierce my heart. I did however suffer from a pretty significant heart contusion (basically a bruised heart) among other injuries. It was the most painful thing I've ever experienced. So yeah, this situation makes my heart hurt, but my heart has been through much worse and kept on ticking along. \n\nSorry if I rambled a lot, posting this to you all is like a form of therapy and the more thoughts that pop up in my mind, I just write them down for you all to read. I haven't told my family and other friends yet, I'll be tackling that soon. I'm glad the invites hadn't already been sent, at least I don't have to send out a cancellation notice. I deleted Dale off all social media and blocked his email address. I didn't block him off my phone yet because, honestly, I'm curious to his reaction. I can promise you all that I will not respond AT ALL. Not to a single text or call. But I can't help but be interested to see how he reacts. I will block him tomorrow though. Mike told me that the second his messages turn ugly or hateful because I'm not responding, block him. He doesn't want Dale to hurt me anymore than he already has. He's right and I really do plan to block him regardless by tomorrow after seeing his initial reaction.\n\nI guess that's all I have to update. Thank you all for caring about me. I will continue moving forward and I will never stop wearing clothes that show my scar. I've never hidden it before and I'm not going to let some asshole make me feel like I should. From the bottom of my heart, thank you all for your love. You gave amazing comments and messages. I will never forget the nice things you all have said to me. Seriously, thank you!\n\nPS: I think I will dress up as Edward Scissorhands for Halloween.\n\n**tl;dr** got my stuff out of the apartment, left fianc\u00e9 with basically no explanation. Besides a tub of vanilla ice cream and a little note. I'm feeling okay at this moment but it's been up and down all day and will continue to for a long time.\n\n**Edit:** So last night got pretty crazy. It started with Dale playing dumb and asking what was going on and what did he do? Like I promised all of you, I didn't respond. The dick knew exactly what he'd done. He just kept texting and kept texting. One text that I found particularly infuriating was \"I can't think of anything I have done to deserve this. Whatever you think I've done isn't true I'm sure you just misunderstood and I can explain. I mean damn you didn't have to be so dramatic and just leave me like this\".\n\nI love how he was already saying that I just misunderstood what I \"think\" he's done and that he can explain. He's such a shit person that he wouldn't  even just come out and admit to the emails and say he's sorry. And then to call me dramatic.\n\nThe texts progressed into angry ones. Here is a string of texts from him, word for word (except that I corrected some grammar because his grammar is ridiculous). Each text was probably sent about 2 minutes apart, sometimes less. Just so you understand the level of crazy here. I will refer to myself as \"Elle\" in these because he uses my name a lot and my real name starts with an \"L\" so seems appropriate. I blocked him after this, by the way.\n\n\"Baby you know how much I love you, I'm at a loss right now. I don't understand, why won't you answer me??\"\n\n\"I just tried calling. ELLE PLEASE PICK UP!\"\n\n\"We are getting married, I thought you cared about me. I guess I was wrong.\"\n\n\"I guess you are cold hearted.\"\n\n\"Elle??????\"\n\n\"Baby??\"\n\n\"Are you ok? At least answer me so I know you are ok and not hurt or something.\"\n\n\"Seriously?????\"\n\n\"ELLE!!!!\"\n\n\"Seriously you're a bitch.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that, I'm just getting really worried and upset.\"\n\nHe took about a 20 minute break between that one and this monstrosity:\n\n\"You know what, I did mean that. You're a f**king bitch for doing this. If you were unhappy you should have told me. I can't believe you would do this to me, I love you. You are just like your father but even worse because at least your mom is a c--t and so are you so who can blame him. Don't ever contact me again or come crawling back and good luck finding a guy who will love a f**king circus freak bitch. Lol lol lol, dumbass\".\n\nSo that's when I blocked him. I know nothing he said was true but still... this wasn't just an email to his ex, this was something he sent to me *directly*. I cried a lot after that one, it hit me pretty hard. This is someone I was planning a future with just a couple of days ago. He was so sweet, as far as I knew obviously. He used to kiss my hand almost every morning. It's just such a shock it's hard to wrap my mind around it.\n\nLast night was a really tough night to get through for me.\n\nI keep reading back what I wrote in this update last night and it helps to keep me feeling strong. I keep reading all of your lovely comments and messages from the original post and it helps to keep me feeling loved and strong. Jake and Mike are wonderful and I'm lucky to have them to hold my hand and help me through this. \n\nThough his texts hurt me, they also reaffirmed that he's a spineless weasel and that I 10000% did the right think by leaving. He's making it really easy to get over him.\n\nSorry this got so long, I wanted to really include you all in what's happening. Thanks for checking in on me and caring about what happens to me, love to you all!\n\n**Little update:** Wow! You are all amazing, wonderful people. So much love and support, I'm crying because of all your lovely, sweet messages. It's honestly so encouraging!\n\nI had the intention of responding to some comments but the post is now locked, so I just wanted to make sure to update this to say thank you! I hope you all see this.\n\nI had a lot of people pm me asking if there were any signs that Dale was an asshole so they know what kind of red flags to look out for. Honestly... no. I wish I could say yes to that so I could potentially prevent others from going through what I did or something similar. He was very attentive and loving, he never once made fun of my appearance (to my face), he seemed to appreciate my ambition and independence. I never felt controlled or criticized for being a financially stable, educated woman.\n\nI had a therapist after I lost my friend in the accident. My father had also walked out earlier that year so we were discussing this and how I hadn't seen it coming. My therapist told me that people can make you see whatever they want you to see but that they can't keep up the facade forever. Things almost always come to a head eventually. The only thing you can do is be secure enough with yourself to understand that the faults of others has nothing to do with you. Just make sure you surround yourself with enough good people that you can afford to lose one or two along the way. \n\nI suppose that would be my advice on the matter. Love people openly and let yourself be loved but always keep hold of yourself and make sure you have yourself covered should someone let you down along the way.\n\nAs far as the dress goes, I believe I will take the advice of many of you and donate it to flood victims in Louisiana. It is a beautiful gown. I think what I will burn instead is my reception dress. I've got to burn something. ;)\n\nThanks Reddit, I sincerely love all of you and wish you the best in all of your life endeavors! I might pop back up in a few weeks to update you all on how I'm doing.\n\n<3 Elle",

            "> I cried a lot after that one, it hit me pretty hard.\n\nThose disgusting words were carefully picked to do as much damage as he possibly could. He literally sat there and figured out what is the most painful thing he could possibly say. And you know why he was able to? Because he knew you, because you've opened up to this person. And, once again, he broke your trust in a horrific way. \n\nTo let them to get to you with those words is the same as getting depressed when somebody straightforwardly says \"I am trying to hurt you, so please hurt as much as possible. Go!\"\n\nHe used what he knew would hurt most. He used the years he has known you for against you. He stooped sooooo low, that the only thing you should be taking from that message is that he is the worst human being you've come across so far.

I took reddit's advice and catfished him...\n\nA few hours after I set the bait, I found that his profile had been deleted.\n\nWhen he came home from work I showed him the screen shot and asked him what was up.\n\nLong story short, He was hanging out with his coworker and the coworker was frustrated with figuring out how to navigate the ame dating site. My fiance signed into his old account (opened in 2013) to try to help his friend figure it out. Apparently a lot had changed on this particular site and he realized that his knowledge on the site was too out of date so he logged out and that was it. A few days later he saw in his email that he had gotten a message from a woman on the site and he then deleted his account.\n\nHe obviously couldn't show me his dating site account, but he did volunteer to show me his email account with all the alerts from the site, the only woman that had messaged him recently was clearly my fake account. He also realized when we were looking through his email that he had an unused old profile on another dating site, he signed in and deleted that one in front of me.\n\nI fessed up about catfishing him. He wasn't upset at all. Said he understood completely considering my history. He was more upset with himself for not realizing that his behavior would make me so insecure.\n\nI apologized for not trusting him and catfishing. He apologized for being so distant lately and not deleting his dating profiles ages ago.\n\nHe offered an open phone/social media/email policy between us, in case we ever stumble across another \"trust but verify\" type of situation.\n\nTl;Dr: It was an old profile. He signed in to try to help a friend figure out the app. He saw the message from my catfishing attempt, thought they were real and deleted his profile. We talked it over, no one is mad.

We met on a dating site and a few months ago we were a little distant because of stress and him finishing school. I got insecure and went through his phone and found dating app messages. I confronted him about it and it turned out that it was just spam and he proved it to me by logging in and showing me that the last activity was a month before he met me.

I knew it was probably nothing, but there's always that voice.  \n\n\nBF was out of the country at the time (even weirder that his profile was showing up!), I debated waiting for him to come back (where the small voice might become a louder voice), or just saying it to him via text (where I can't read his facial expression / tone of voice). I did end up just messaging him, he knows I have a touch of anxiety so I told him I knew it was likely nothing but just needed to raise it with him to shut that voice up. He reassured me that he just hadn't deactivated account and that he's not using it or any other dating apps, where we live or abroad. He said he wasn't bothered to reinstall the app just to deactivate it, unless I really wanted him to, I'm not that fussed.\n\nHe travels a lot for work, before his next trip we were out for dinner, I made a joke about it and told him I wouldn't accuse him of cheating on me this time, he took out his phone, placed it in front of me and said \\*\"Anytime you want to check, just let me know.\"\\*  \n\n\nWho knew communication resolves issues in relationships!?",

The advice was overwhelmingly along the lines of \"this is a major problem and will not go away\" - and I agreed with it at the time. However, after posting, I decided to wait a bit just to see how things went because I really liked the guy.\n\n\nThere are a couple of things that affected his behaviour that I didn't really understand before:\n\n\n\n* He is not fulfilled by his work, and so any time not spent in work is really important to him and he wants to make the most of it\n\n* Most of his close friends are big drinkers, and he was trying to cut back. This meant that he was not seeing his friends as often as all they do is go out on the weekend together. \n\n\nThese two things together meant that he was alone a lot more than he used to be and he was feeling frustrated in general. So here's what has happened since:\n\n\nOver the summer, I wasn't in classes anymore and we spent a lot of time together. This sort of goes against intuition, as I thought more time apart would be better. But there are a lot of days when I don't feel like doing anything, so if he wanted to spend time with me, that meant that he had to come up with something to do while I was reading or sewing or doing whatever on my own. He got comfortable with watching something or reading something while I was sitting there doing my own thing.\n\n\nHe figured out how to hang out with his friends without making it a big drinking night. They started going out to dinner once in a while. He would go out with them occasionally and just not drink as much and go home early. I think this really helped him not feel so alone.\n\n\nHe came to terms with how unfulfilling his job is and he's currently working to fix that. A few months ago, we started having some honest conversations about what he really wanted to do, and he was trying to figure that out for a while. Well now he has a solid plan of getting to that new career, and while it will take some time, he gets so excited just talking about it. I think this has helped tremendously.\n\n\nThanks to everyone who commented. I think everyone was exactly right that it was a pretty major problem, which is why I posted. I appreciate everyone telling me that though. Sometimes you need to hear that. I'm glad I gave it a chance to fix itself though. I honestly couldn't be happier in my relationship than I am now.\n\ntl;dr: boyfriend and I are still together, he's figured out to be alone, things are great.",

I could not cope with my boyfriend being busy. He would have been 100% justified in dumping me but I\u2019m v glad he didn\u2019t. It\u2019s been about 4 years since I started therapy and medication and things are just so great. Turns out I\u2019m actually super independent when I\u2019m happy and sane\u2014we\u2019ve been together 6 years now. Good luck to you both!",
            "This hits close to home.\nI was the one needing more attention, but he was too unhappy with his life to love me the same. Most of the time spent together he was not 'present' and I thought he needed time away from me to regain interest. Turns out he just needed my silent company and support. How easy was that?\n\nJust shows how much a little more patience, love and a lack of sarcasm can help.  \n\nI'm really happy you took the hard route of fixing the relationship :). It's too easy for a third party to tell you to dump him. Self unfullfillment is a huge problem nowadays and is the root to depression and anxiety. I wish you guys the best of luck!",

            "That's awesome!\n\nit really goes to show that when there's a major problem problem happening - especially a problem that can turn into a toxic relationship dynamic or might be a red flag - it's almost *always* worth having a little patience to try and untangle whatever the actual causes might be. It can be hard to come to a true understanding like that and it takes a lot of honest conversation, self reflection, and empathy on both sides. It sounds like you guys navigated it in a mature and productive way, and you'll both be stronger for it in the long run.\n\nThis is also a great example of how things never change over night - it really does take several conversations, weeks of thinking and working through it and being mindful, and then months to implement a major change in habits (like learning how to spend time differently) and to start working on long term fixes (like finding a new career). \n\nIt says a lot about how much you value him that you were willing to give him the time and space to figure this out and start on a new path. It also says a lot of good things about him that he actually listened and took genuine steps to fixing the issue. \n\nanyway. I'm a sucker for healthy relationships, and it sounds like you have the foundation for one :)\n",
            "I'm glad you two decided to talk it through and see how it went. This sub is quick to say \"move on, more fish\" but this is a good example of listening to your gut and seeing it through.\n\nMy husband, whom I love dearly, is a little more \"clingy\" to me than I am to him. It's not that he doesn't like being alone, it's that he sometimes just doesn't have any options and given being lonely or being with me, he'd rather be with me. Sometimes I need to be alone, I need the space and the option to have it. This causes some friction but he has no idea because for me to say I want to be alone when he clearly needs the company would hurt his feelings, and I don't want to do that. But when we married I told him straight up that sometimes I will need to be alone, it's part of who I am and it's a need. We didn't live together first so it was after we married that I saw how that would shake out. He's totally fine with that as needed and sometimes even asks me if I need it before I think of it. It's really about recognizing what the person needs at that moment and knowing you'll get what you need later.",
            "Sorry, I\u2019m not sure if you addressed this and I missed it, but is he actually able to spend time alone? Or is he just in your house doing his own thing?",
            "I'm very glad that you and your boyfriend are doing better!\n\nEdit: word",
            "I just love happy updates. ",
            "90% of this Reddit will simply suggest breaking up rather than any advice on how to fix the problem.\n\nI\u2019m glad to hear you fought through it :)",
            "I'm glad this worked out! I am an only child and when I met my now husband he was horrible at being alone. He is the oldest of 6 kids close in age.\n\nWe discussed and talked a lot, got a dog and he knows I NEED my alone time. Now it's just part of our lives. Sometimes I need my alone time.",
            "Great OP! I love a happy outcome. ",
            "Yay this amazing and made me really happy for you both! It is so satisfying to not only see yourself grow, but to watch your partner grow as well. I'm really happy you decided to actually work it out, because some things are worth it. Best of luck to you both! \ud83e\udd17",
            "I could have written this myself! I think we are dating the same guy!! \n\nMy bf has so much emotional dependence on me, it feels suffocating at times. I\u2019ve learned that I have to let him know whenever I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed. I\u2019ve told him in clear terms that \u201cI do not want to be responsible for your emotional problems.\u201d He was really receptive and went on a path of introspection about the emotional stress that he burdens onto me. \n\nProgress! Steps at a time. And talk talk talk talking! Yay relationships! ",
            "I'm glad it worked out! I'll be honest, I was getting really discouraged reading the comments on the old post because I saw a lot of my own issues in your description of your boyfriend, and nobody else seemed to be going \"it's not malicious, just something he needs to work on.\" I'm working on it myself, so it was really great to read what was working for you and him, and I think it might help me too. Thanks for sharing!",
            "You have to look at this from a reverse standpoint too. If you were not doing much and he was going out and doing stuff or busy with other things, you might get needy as well. Everyone in relationships are like that. Throwing the relationship away as some suggested is just dumb when all it takes is a little bit of life changes for him. ",
            "This is awesome because he\u2019s really working to improve himself and the situations around him. Shoutout to him for taking action and shoutout to you for having his back and supporting him. ",
            "This is a nice update for sure. I was surprised that everyone in the comments of the original post was telling you to break up with him. I can be a lot like him sometimes\u2013 I get really anxious and lonely when my SO is busy. However, I have a couple interesting hobbies and some great friends to talk with. In therapy for mild anxiety and self-confidence issues as well. TL;DR: it's totally possible to manage and overcome separation issues!",
            "i went to read the original post and thought the comments were way too harsh. have half of these people even dated anyone? i\u2019m glad you guys worked through it and you seem better than ever! \nthis post is my cue to unsubscribe, though. the comments are always so full of angst. ",
            "This doesn't really address the issue of him not wanting you to be alone because you might get hit on. That was one of the brightest red flags in your OP. ",
            "Glad you made a decision that you thought was best for your relationship as you understand it better than anyone else. My relationship started off not the best. Bf had a lot of dependency issues but now after 5 years we figured it out and things are much better for us. Although I usually don\u2019t advise people to go my route because it\u2019s definitely not easy at all. I know relationships are not suppose to be easy but I can never guarantee someone that things will work out for them like it did for me and I would hate for them to spend years trying to fix someone that just does not want to be better. It doesn\u2019t always work out for everyone. ",
            "You're an amazing partner to your SO. Glad it worked out ",
            "This made me smile. I read the comments on your previous post and felt bad for the guy. He just found someone really awesome and wanted to spend time with her. But now you are helping him getting his life on track and everyone\u2019s happy. Good for you ",
            "I really think \u201cjust break up\u201d should be banned as a response unless emotional, physical, or other forms of abuse or cheating are presented in the post. \n\nIt\u2019s so easy to suggest breaking up when you don\u2019t have any involvement and all we have is what the problem is and not what the other factors are.\n\nOn one end it does give a form of objective opinion. Though, it\u2019s not necessarily a well-informed one. ",
            "Good for you both! Here\u2019s to the future, whatever it may hold! \ud83d\udc95",
            "This is downright heartwarming. OP, you did something difficult for a fellow human that will help him for the rest of his life. It was a giant red flag, and you did constructive action that helped you both.\n\nYou deserve your happiness and I hope you have more of it. Keep on being awesome, OP.",
            "Who told you the problem couldn\u2019t be solved? That\u2019s a really easy problem to fix, especially with a small handful of counseling sessions. Take whoever told you it was over out back and beat them over the head with a dead cat",
            "So glad you guys are good now, I think many people believe one person should fulfill you in every possible way and that could not be any further from the truth. You have to be fulfilled within yourself and your life with out a partner first before you can be truly happy with a significant other ",
            "Im so glad you guys are doing better! Congratulations to you guys both on using communication cause most people do not know how to efficiently. More power to you",
            "In my case, anxiety alone is enough to ruin a relationship. I think it's really good that you guys took the time to meet regularly which is I think somehow help to calm the nervousness. Just being together and doing your own things can ease the stress too. ",
            "Your bf did a good job of overcoming those drinking issues..i had similar issues but i stopped hanging around certain groups because they literally lived on alcohol if they weren't at work. It's great he didn't have to sacrifice friends because they worked around the issue and your bf is also looking to further his career which is great for someone at his age.\nImo keep motivating \ud83d\udc4d",
            "I'm not crying, you're crying \ud83d\ude2d",
            "This sounds like how I would be as a BF. I already know Quality Time is pretty much my primary love language so any time that I can spend around my GF would be well spent. Don't have many good work or friend relationships that fulfill that need, so I've learned to do things on my own and I do enjoy some alone time, but I definitely appreciate the times when I can be with someone. ",
            "I can relate to this in some ways. I've been feeling lonely recently, but tried figuring out my feelings and how to feel less lonely. I'm trying to compromise by joining the group voice chat whenever my friends are online and playing. Although, I'm not playing with them, I'm fine just being able to talk here and then and having fun. Main problem is how to be alone and being fine with that. I guess, I have to love myself completely before that.\n\nTalking about this knowing that some people don't believe they have a person (friend, family, partner) that can support them through difficult times makes me pretty sad. Makes me feel blessed that I have such amazing friends in my life. ",

            "i really think people on this sub are too quick to pull the \"break up, you cant fix this\" card. simply because it's easier to tell someone to leave rather than doing it yourself. i always try to have more empathy though, im glad everything is working out for you. ",
            "This is wholesome. Happy for you, OP. ",
            "I'm glad that everything is working out for the two of you. I wish you for happy future. it's really nice to see a couple working things through together.",

            "Great update, but sad for your half-happiness. I know it seems like a victory, but they're right, they're are a bunch of red flags, and you deserve the full joy. One thing I've had to learn, even in non-partner relationships, is our job isn't to fix or plan on how to fix, or look at things to smooth over, that we haven't really fixed or even can fix. You sound awesome...you deserve the whole cupcake--not just the icing...that if too much, will just make u sick. Go get yours, you deserve it.",
