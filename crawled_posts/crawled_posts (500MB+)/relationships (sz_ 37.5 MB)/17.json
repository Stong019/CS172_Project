        "selftext": "[Here is the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lvz0t/my_25f_professor_30m_asked_me_to_go_on_a_date/)\n\nHi everyone! I just wanted to thank you all for your comments on my last post :) They really helped me. I was asked for an update so here we go...\n\nAnyways, I think I should have worded myself better. I wrote the post on May 30th and my convocation was on June 4th. I put \"next month\" in the title but realistically, I should have put \"next week.\" I digress. Looking back, the timeline is probably confusing but this post should clear it up.\n\nFirst and foremost, I GOT A JOB :) It is at quite a large PR firm within the city and I start next week. They didn't ask me for references, but instead, told me they looked at my LinkedIn profile and saw that I had quite a few recommendations there, so they were satisfied with that. I'm so excited!!\n\nSo I never ended up using Mark's letter of recommendation. After posting, I decided that I do want to explore something romantic with him. I immediately felt better after getting some third party advice, so the next day, I emailed him (I didn't have his phone number) and said this:\n\n\"Mark,\n\nFirst off, I want to say that I am incredibly grateful for the recommendation letter you compiled for me. I have a second interview tomorrow at one of the agencies I was telling you about. I'm a bit anxious but also quite excited. \n\nI just wanted to let you know that I will not be using the letter after all. I thought about what you asked me and I am very interested in going out to dinner with you. You have been an awesome mentor this last semester but I am ready to see a different side of you. I promise we don't have to get Indian food :)\n\nI wanted to apologize if I seemed standoffish when you asked me; I wasn't expecting it and it took me a while to process it all. \n\nAgain, thank you for the letter. Maybe I will see you at convocation this Saturday? And, just in case you may want it, here's my number 555-555-5555. \"\n\n(The Indian food  bit was from when he was sick one day and said he is 99% sure he got food poisoning from trying a butter chicken dish at a dive bar)\n\nAnyways, I received a text from him an hour later and we have been talking ever since. On Friday, I found out I got the job and told him. He said he wasn't surprised and I would do really well there.\n\nSaturday was my convocation. My parents flew down and it was great! I saw Mark at the mixer and he had a huge grin on his face and waved. I was busy taking photos and whatnot and noticed he left later on. He told me he didn't want to spoil my day and said we would talk soon.\n\nWe decided to go out to dinner yesterday (Sunday). To keep it short, it was great, he was great and he walked me back to my condo. We said goodnight and he started walking away. I was kind of disappointed and turned to walk into the door but I heard him call my name and he kissed me :) He said he's still new at this.\n\nAnyways this post was probably all over the place but I'm actually just feeling really giddy and excited. Between the new job, finally graduating and the lovely date I had with my ex-super-hot-prof, I'm on cloud nine right now.\n\nThanks for everything guys! Your advice really helped!\n   \nTLDR: Got a new job, graduated and went on a date with Mark. He's a good kisser. I'm happy.",

This quickly turned into a romantic attachment. Our age difference is greater than that of you and Mark. I have never regretted my choice of partner, and our relationship is healthy and loving.\n\nAll that is to say good luck, and these kinds of relationships can absolutely work.",

I took the advice to be generally supportive of the lGBTQA community without being obvious about it. I also spend some time reading about bisexuality. \n\nI did post a story on June 1 but the best thing that happened was that his friend came out as bi herself. We follow each other on Instagram and she had made a post about it. I made a comment congratulating her and wishing her well. She did text me about a dinner and  while we were   \n chatting she thanked me for my support and this wonderful woman gave me an another opportunity to express my support and do it in more personal way than a comment. \n\nHe came out to me about a week ago. He was very nervous and still scared and all I wanted to do was tell me that I knew but from what I have read letting people do it on their own terms were really important. He told me, nothing would change. He just wanted me to know and he didn't want to hide a part of himself. It was okay. I told him nothing had to change. He was the perfect man for me and I loved him no matter what. \n\nHe did ask me later if I knew and I came clean. I told him I saw. Apologized for it and cried a lot. He was upset but understanding. He even apologized for suddenly changing his behavior which is bullshit as I should have dealt with it a lot more maturely. it just hit just right spot of insecurity for me.\n\nThings are fine. He is happier and we are getting back to our old routines. \n\n TL;DR:  He came out. I confessed to snooping and things are okay.",

            "From a bi woman monogamously married to a bi man, I also want to express my reassurance that this doesn\u2019t change the dynamic of a marriage. My husband and I both discovered that the other was bi after we married, and the knowledge has only positively impacted our relationship. It\u2019s been lovely joking about people we both find attractive, having the same celebrity crush, and just feeling more open expressing certain parts of our identities. \n\nI remember hearing something about attraction while being in a committed relationship. The relationship doesn\u2019t blind us to other people who we may find attractive, however we can admire a beautiful painting in a museum without wanting to fuck it. With this in mind, my husband and I can easily chat about things and people we find attractive, without feeling insecure about our relationship. My husband, as I think your husband did as well, married me because he loves the prospect of our future and family together. Attraction is just one small component of this.",
            "Straight spouse with a bi husband here as well. Glad you had such a good resolution! I completely understand why you feel/felt insecure, but at the end of the day it's about trusting your partner in the same way that you would if they were straight.",
            "As a bi woman in a monogamous straight passing relationship, I just wanted to assure you that this does NOT mean he's suddenly going to want to sleep with men or open your relationship or anything like that.\n\nMany of us bi folk are bi AND still 100% monogamous regardless of the gender of the person we love. Just because we're bi doesn't mean we HAVE to be in relationships or have sex with other people of other genders all the time, and just because we're in a relationship with someone of the opposite gender doesn't mean we're straight and just confused either.\n\nMonogamous bi people are in a relationship with the person we're with, we're attracted to them and we love them. Sure, we may have attraction to other genders, like, celebrity crushes etc, we may watch porn of same genders or have passing fantasies... but our **real** focus is on the person we're with. It's no different from a straight person having passing crushes or dreams about other people than the person they're in a relationship with. It doesn't mean anything beyond just an imagining.\n\nMy BF of 16 yrs recently came out as pan & is exploring being gender fluid as well, but he knew I was bi from when we first got together and our monogamy has never been a question. Regardless of our orientations and how our self identities may evolve, we love and are attracted to each other first.\n\nSo don't let your fears project onto him (although your worries are totally normal and understandable). Keep that open, loving, trusting communication going and you won't get any surprises. Keep creating the safe space of loving communication and sharing with the focus on solving problems as a team instead of making each other the problem & you two will always be able to figure things out.\n\nEdited because I realized I missed a few words & a couple if things didn't make sense. Thinking faster than I type lol\n\nEdit 2: I'm very moved at the response this comment has gotten. Much love to my fellow monogamous bi's out there, but in a platonic way only of course lol (And I have nothing at all against ethical non-monogamy, neither is \"better\", what's best is what works for the people involved!).",
            "This is a fantastic outcome! <3 I truly love seeing stories like this, because I see how differently bi men are treated than bi women. <3",
            "It can be harder for bi men in straight relationships because the homophobia around that is pretty high.  There is a lot of toxic ideas about masculinity where society says that bi-men are really gay because no \"real man\" would even think about being with another man.  I don't know if you saw that blind dating show - but there was a couple that was moving toward marriage and the woman found out that the man had relations with men before and she was disgusted and felt betrayed to the extent she felt he did something vehemently evil to her by not telling her on the first date.   That comes from society telling people that being on a spectrum of sexuality that is not 100 one direction is a betrayal to their partner.  So for men who date women, it's particularly scary for that to come out because the fear of stigma and someone leaving them is based in a very sad reality.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so glad that you showed him that your love for him is true and that even with this knowledge you are committed and are not disgusted by him.  Not telling you directly may feel like a betrayal, but it is rooted in the realistic high probability that a straight partner would not just walk out, but would lose respect and develop animosity and hatred for the person who loves them.",

            "It took me almost 20 years to come out to my wife as pan. For guys bi/pan guys, there's always this fear that a cis-female we're in a relationship will just think we're gay. A bi/pan guy in a committed relationship with a female is often no different than a straight guy in that same context. No matter how many different types of people he happens to be attracted to, he chose *you* and a loyal guy is a loyal guy regardless of orientation. Hell, you could even look at it this way: as a bi guy, he has A LOT more options than a straight guy and chose you anyway. You could choose to take that as a very high complement.",

I think hubs has pretty much always known. We were friends long before we dated and he had gone with me to gay bars and such. \nThe most important thing is to just continue being open and honest with each other. Make sure you are making time to communicate when you have questions or frustrations, instead of either of you hiding information or snooping on devices. Maybe take time to set a regular date night with no devices, just to talk. Being bi doesn't change the relationship, but lack of communication certainly can.",
            "Unsolicited advice so ignore if you want: As the bi partner in a monogamous relationship with a straight person. One thing that has been extremely meaningful to me is not just being accepted by my partner after I came out, but being thoroughly seen and celebrated. My bisexuality isn't just something my partner tolerate but actively accepts and celebrates.\n\nIt's different for every relationship and every person, but when you are ready and it feels genuine, you could think of ways to support and celebrate your husband's bisexuality. I think it will go a long way",

Bi male here and my SO has insecure moments where my sexuality or past comes up from time to time.\n\nYour feelings may not be completely resolved or processed, so be open to exploring honestly your feelings of insecurity or jealousy. And be open to allowing him to admire or look at men without it immediately throwing alarms! (Now you can both drool over the Hemsworth brothers! \ud83d\ude0d) \n\nIf you both talk openly and communicate honestly everything you are feeling, (using \"me\" and \"I\" statements, not \"you\" statements) you'll be able to navigate them together.

I appreciate all the advice that everyone gave. I called the bird brain last night and basically went off on him. He had explained that they previously did have a past many years ago but they had reconnected after his last relationship but it was strictly platonic but THEN...\n\nHe tells me that he has herpes? That's one thing. Then tells me that I should possibly get tested. The last time we were physically together was in May. I confronted him and asked him if he slept with someone and he admitted that he slept with one person (pretty sure there were more). He said it meant nothing and it was only physical and there was nothing emotional about it. I asked why he did it and he said it was more of a \"last hurrah\" before he moved but it was with someone totally random. I asked how you meet someone random and he hesitated and said Tinder.\n\nHearing all of this I didn't know what to say and was in complete shock. He said he was sorry and it didn't mean anything. He said he understood if I wanted to break up but would still want to be friends because \"I'm really important in his life\". I obviously immediately broke up with him but it feels like a huge weight is off of my shoulders. I don't plan on being friends with him either since it shows that he\u2019s trying to have me around in his life, more of a benefit to him. He's a piece of shit and I'm glad he has herpes :)\n\nAnother UPDATE:\nThere were things I needed to get off my chest for my own closure and so I sent him a message saying that I\u2019m not comfortable being friends after everything that he\u2019s done and he\u2019s trying to keep me around and what not. He responded back with a few messages but the one I thought that was hilarious was when he said \u201cI am upset about the whole situation and the prospect of losing you in my life. You are an amazing woman and it was a pleasure getting to know you. I wish you the best and hope down the line, we are able to reconcile.\u201d \n\nI realized with his response, he never apologized for hurting me or about the situation itself and saying HE\u2019S hurt? I\u2019m glad I got out of it sooner then later. I removed him off all my socials as well \n\nThank you everyone for the comments and support. I\u2019ll make an appointment soon to get tested\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: The tool slept with someone else while we were still exclusively together and is a piece of shit",

            "Guuuuurl...\n\nI had a huge crush on my best guy friend who I had known since I was 14 years old. We were best friends and talked all the time. He moved away to go to college and we still talked and were super close all those years. We met in middle school when we were babies, around 2004 or so. When we started dating when I was 25, it felt amazing. I was literally dating the guy I had the biggest crush on since I was a teenager. We had such a whirlwind romance. He was sweet to me, he bought me flowers, he treated me like gold, and I moved to NYC with him for a long time and we lived that New York life and completely had it made.\n\nThen...\n\nI had to use my laptop for something, but mine was having a huge update going on, so I just used his laptop (something I've never done before) and his email was open and there were DOZENS of emails where he was chatting with other MEN and I saw dozens of emails of him and other dudes setting up meet-up times to sleep together.\n\nI confronted him for sleeping with dozens of men while in a relationship with me and he didn't even deny it.\n\n\"It was just physical, it didn't mean anything! I love you! You're so important to me and I love you so much. Those men meant nothing to me, I'm not even gay. I'm completely 100% heterosexual.\"\n\nWas literally what he said. Also, I have nothing against gay people at all. My ex was a cheating scumbag -- it just so happened that the people he cheated on me with were randoms from the internet that he'd have one night stands with. People who use the whole: \"It was just physical, it didn't mean anything\" excuse are vile pieces of garbage.\n\nI luckily didn't have STDs and checked myself for everything after this incident. To this day, I'm still mad about this breakup and it's been half a decade already. Will likely hold a grudge until the end of time over this one.",

That takes EFFORT. More effort than he was willing to put into you. Maybe there was no emotions involved, but he went out of his way and made a conscious effort to cheat on you.

When someone is in a relationship, you *modify* your behavior. I don't get physical/grabby or flirty, I don't call or text past a certain reasonable time (no, it's not okay to be texting a partnered up or married person of the opposite sex (hetero) at 11pm unless it's an emergency).\n\nIf you have an SO with a questionable best friend, and they both don't feel like there are boundaries, then RUN!\n\n- Especially if they try to gaslight you and make you feel like you're being insecure, etc.\n\nIn general, you should never be made to feel like your reasonable boundaries aren't important.\n\nAnd telling you months into the relationship that he has herpes?

As many of you suggested, I couldn\u2019t possibly build my life around someone who lied so pathologically. \n\nI initially agreed to work on the relationship provided that my ex get therapy to work through why he felt compelled to lie about so many aspects of his \u201clife\u201d. I also requested that he come clean to his parents, my parents, and anyone else he lied to or embellished the truth to. He agreed to this and seemed genuinely interested in working on things and himself. I really wanted it to work out and was willing to accept that maybe he was just wildly insecure/had some attachment issues or something that caused him to act this way. I waited 4 months for the therapy and confessions to happen and they never did, not surprisingly.\n\nFor those of you who were confused about how I didn\u2019t know he did not own this apartment for so long/thought I had never met his parents - I had met them many, many times. But tbh they are pretty cold people who I never really connected with that much and was definitely not comfortable enough to be like \u201chey, is your son a pathological liar or is all of this true?\u201d. On top of that, he also told a lot of these lies to his parents as well so they wouldn\u2019t have been keen to what I was talking about anyway.\n\nIt got to the point where basically anything that came out of his mouth seemed like a lie or at least a half-truth to me. Also, I lost respect for someone who could lie so easily and then not even feel guilty enough or any remorse to come clean about it. I\u2019m pretty honest, almost to a fault. So the cognitive dissonance there that occurred from being with someone who had basically opposite values from me was tough.\n\nI\u2019m sure there were a lot of other things he was hiding, but I don\u2019t even care. I\u2019ve been single and living alone for a week and to be frank I\u2019m killin it. Im now responsible for 100% of my rent and I barely have any savings left, but I still feel like a giant weight has lifted off my shoulders. Crazy how that works. \n\nI want to thank all of the people who gave me the hard truth straight up and encouraged me to leave. Even though it was all coming from internet strangers, it still helps to hear people tell you that you deserve more than what you\u2019re getting. I\u2019m so happy and I must be giving off a much better vibe because I\u2019ve already had 2 dates and been asked for my number a handful of times (I\u2019m a server at a restaurant lol). I sound like a cocky asshole but god does it feel good to remember you\u2019re not as worthless as someone made you feel. \n\nThanks Reddit, and if any of you are in a relationship with someone who is like this - GTFO and don\u2019t look back.",

            "My last relationship was built on a lie. He had suffered a gambling addiction, and never told me until our entire life was falling apart  then I look back and realize there were soooo many lies. \n\n I didn't understand why he was always coming home super late from work and not coming home some nights, he would just tell me he was with his aunt or his uncle, and I gave him space to do that and trusted him completely. \n\nThis went on for like a year, I had a baby daughter, just about 2 years old at the time. He helped me take care of her and drove us to daycare and work, and did errands for us. \n\nSo one day I needed him to pay the rent, I had saved up 600$ in an envelope and arranged for him to meet the landlord. After work that day he told me he met with the landlord and paid the rent. 5 days later, my landlord called me asking when my ex would be able to stop by with the rent money, she hasn't been able to get ahold of him after he called and canceled....... yeah. Money was gone. \n\nAnd then I broke up with him but I felt bad because he would be homeless (and not able to see his daughter who I actually cared about) so I allowed him to live in my basement apartment (own separate entrance, bathroom, and kitchen). I gave him 90 days to get a new place. I told him he could keep the phone I got him, but he would have to pay for his half of the phone bill. He agreed, he told me he would pay everything back, and the rent. \n\nBut I never got anything. I paid his rent for that 90 days. I paid his phone bill for that 90 days. I paid back the landlord with all my tax return money so I couldn't afford to get myself anything nice that year. The worst part is he stole the really nice flute that my mom bought me and probably sold or pawned it, I couldn't find it in the storage closet downstairs after he moved. :( \n\nThen he moved out a week after the 90 days, and left the basement totally trashed. I spent my 30th b-day cleaning it up. \n\nHe's been gone from my life for 6 years and I'm still recovering from the financial abuse. Any kind of lie is a huge red flag.",
            "My husband lied to me about where he lived and how he and his family lost their house and that\u2019s why they lived in a trailer and to not talk to his mom about it because it really upsets her. He even took me to this house and told me stories of how he\u2019d sneak out from this window and his room was there and what not. I believed him because he had never lied to me and I had no reason to believe he would. Weeeeelll a year later we\u2019re living in an apartment together and I\u2019m pregnant with our first child and he tells me super casual like that he lied. And he never lived in that house he showed me and it was all a lie to impress me because I come from money and he thought I wouldn\u2019t date him. \n\n\nWell was fucking pissed but my dumbass stayed. \n\nThen I found out the our living room furniture in our apartment was rented and not something he bought off this guy he knew. \n\nAnd then I would find a bunch of little lies out. \n\nLike that ex girlfriend who was harassing him and kept bothering us and pestering us and sending me and him harassing text messages and \u201cgoing to his house\u201d and taking pictures of his car. And that wouldn\u2019t leave us alone for 8 months...it was him all along. \n\nAnd I found out it was him when I got his sisters number and her number was the same number that would send me messages. But I\u2019ve never confronted him about it because I don\u2019t know how clean he\u2019d come about it. \n\nThere\u2019s been so many more instances of little lies here and there but I ended up marrying him and I\u2019m now coming to terms with the fact I married a pathological liar but I\u2019m waiting to graduate to leave. \n\n\nAll this is to say I\u2019m glad you got out because this shit only gets worse.",

She told me she had wanted to tell me for a while, but didn't know where to start-- that she thought about Sam everyday but at the same time didn't know how to begin.\n\nShe pulled out a shoe box from her closet and she showed me the pictures. Pictures of her wedding, this propped up little thing at the courthouse, her in a short white dress with a slight stomach. Her husband, this cocky smiled kid with this shaggy blond hair. \n\nThen the baby, Sam. Pictures from a red-faced baby to this little four year old person. Birthdays, and Christmases, and pictures of the three of them- a family.\n\nShe talked about Brendan. How they came from these radically different backgrounds and she barely knew him as a person before he was a father and husband. They'd only been dating three months when she got pregnant. They were twenty.\n\nThen she talked about Sam- her baby. She kept saying he was the best thing that ever happened to me. Hearing that broke my heart. She talked about how his hair cow licked in three different spots and how he was always singing or humming, that he loved to climb. She told me his favorite movie and book. She made him a person to me. \n\nThen she told me how they lost him. Some kid ran a red light and then he was gone. She barely remembers the funeral because she was so heavily medicated. But the worst part was after, going home and him not being there- how she'd walk past his room and expect to hear him playing, waking up and forgetting for a minute he was gone. \n\nTheir marriage had never been good and they turned on each other. He blamed her because she had fastened the booster seat on that side of the car. She blamed him because he had been driving. They were divorced within a year after the accident. Brendan had a new child within two.\n\nShe had spent the time doing overload on classes and working, keeping busy because it made things easier.She didn't see her old friends because they drifted away- they never knew what to say. And they mostly had kids of their own. She was surviving. But seeing Sam's brother who looked so much like Sam hurt so much that she decided she had to get away and stop wallowing. She took the pictures down, donated clothes and toys, deleted her fb and stopped seeing the old friends who weren't really friends anymore. She said she chose to keep breathing because that was what it had come down to.

She hurt for such a long time, its no wonder she wanted a fresh start without this horrible memory eating away at her.  \n\nYou came along and gave her this new beginning. I think you two will do just fine. ",

            "as someone who has lost a child in an accident, my heart was broken for her. you listened and now understand slightly, the pain that it causes. never goes away, you just learn to get through the day. you are a good man. i actually choked up reading your update. i wish nothing but the absolute best for both of you and your future family.",

            "I think that... getting to know you was literarily like the first spring breeze after a long winter. You make her feel alive and almost a new, happy person, probably a feeling that she never thought she would experience before meeting you. The way i imagine it, the \"pictures on a fridge\" type of thing might not have happened quite as idyllically in her previous marriage, if they were young and the guy was an arse (as he sounds). She loved and still loves her son, but the picture perfect family, that she will experience with you. You're a great man. \n\nProbably she's going to need some therapy in the future, processing her son's death, which she clearly hasn't yet. Maybe, if you have a house, and she wants to (when she came longer with the processing part), you can install a little stone plaquet in a nice crner of the garden  \"We love you Sam\", and plant flowers around it, if she finds it comforting.

Or, that part of your dream is now gone because she's already done it, you're looking at things the wrong way.\n\nIf she chooses to go through life with you, that choice means more than any arbitrary \"first time\" can mean.  She's a wiser, stronger, and more knowledgeable person now, and she's choosing to work through all the pain from her past in order to move forward.\n\nHer having a shotgun wedding at the young age of 20 to a guy she didn't really love is nothing compared to her adult choice to make a life with you.  So work to put aside your reservations.  Everyone has secrets and regrets from the past, it's just that for most of us they're (fortunately) banal and uninteresting.  \n\nLearn to communicate with her, and let her know she can tell you anything without you blowing up at her or otherwise causing drama.  That's more important than almost anything else in relationships.\n\nBe glad your SO will have the wisdom to appreciate a good marriage and (eventually) a family more than most people do.\n",

As a mother who once lost a child, having other children was very healing, but the other children are not replacements.

            "Glad everything worked out, OP. Truly sorry for your SO's heartache.\n\nI didn't see the original back when you posted it, but I'm thinking a year or so maybe isn't *that* bad when it comes to keeping something truly life-altering away from your current SO. I mean, as a few people pointed out here, **You** are the reason she's chosen to give herself a second chance at love, and I'm betting she wanted to make sure of it before she confided in you. 8 months? \"Could be a passing phase, better not chance it.\" A year? \"This could be it, but I want to know for sure.\" She was probably getting there, and if she still had a box of things in a closet, I'm sure she knew you would have either found them or she would have shown it to you on her own time. \n\nI mean, it sounds like she came out and told you everything, so maybe that's telling that she was 'getting ready' to tell you, and comfortable enough to trust you with her past. The fact that she didn't withdraw immediately is, in my opinion, a really good sign. \n\nGood luck to both of you! :)",
            "I think its great that you're moving ahead and want to build a life and family together...the proverbial new start if you will.  Here's the issue though...you never get over the loss of a child. Never. Ever.  I'm sure if you reflect back over the past 18 months there were most certainly signs from your fiance indicating the loss and emotional trauma that you were probably at a loss to explain at the time.  \n\nApart from medication, I don't know if your GF went through any counseling or therapy at the time of her son's death, but I highly recommend that she and you considers it now.  This is not something you can get through on your own nor can you suppress it by deleting fb accounts. Its always there...just beneath the veneer ready to surface and will almost certainly affect her (and you) when you marry and decide to have children of your own.  \n\nBest of luck to you!  ",

If she does have family I think it would be a good idea if you talked with them about what's happened, with your girl's permission, to make sure the facts are roughly as she told you.

You made it, that's what's important, and you gave a lady the will to push through in life. Hats of to you, and many of us will be waiting when you propose!! :o)\n\n..on another note, you have very refined narration skills. I thought that I was reading part of very well written fiction. Have you perhaps considered writing, or do you write for a living? \n\n",

            "Ok, this is probably going to get downvoted into oblivion... and for your sake I *really* hope that what she has told you is the truth.\n\nBut... I have a friend who was in a similar situation with a girl.  Met her, they were dating several months, he was in love and had just asked her to move in with him. He then was informed (by an old friend of hers) of a \"secret\" life she had before meeting him.\n\n  When he confronted her about it she broke down and told him the story of her first child.  That she met her boyfriend & moved in with him immediately because her mom kicked her out of the house (Mom's boyfriend had supposedly tried to coerce her in to sex) and she had no where to stay.   This guy then became abusive, frequently raped her, and she became pregnant.  He then ramped up the abuse and started  slipping her drugs hoping she would lose the baby.  It didn't work and she had the baby.  The baby's dad and his parents then started a smear campaign against her, reported her to CPS as an unfit mother & drug addict.  They tested the baby and found drugs in it's system, found her \"unfit\" and awarded custody to the paternal grandparents.  She said she didn't have money for a lawyer and couldn't fight the charges, her family refused to help her,  so she decided to move across the country and put the past behind her.\n\nFast forward a few months... girlfriend is now living with him.  He feels so bad about what has happened to her, and wants to be her white knight, he decides to look into it on his own and try and clear her name in the hope she could get the baby back and be a family.\n\nAfter hiring a lawyer & paying the retainer he finds out that she did have a baby that was born addicted to drugs, and was placed in foster care.  Girlfriend wanted to drugs more than have a child and signed her rights away, the foster family (completely unrelated to the baby) then adopted the little boy.  He then contacted girlfriend's sister who said that girlfriend was kicked out of the house because she was addicted to meth and had started stealing from their Mom & her boyfriend... she wouldn't go to rehab, so they cut off all contact with her.\n\nHe confronted her with this information and she couldn't believe that he believed them over her and broke up with him.  He was heartbroken because he still had wanted to somehow make it work with her.  Since this happened several years back, she has been arrested multiple times for identity theft, check fraud, etc.\n\nVery long story short, please do some due diligence and check out the story she has given you before proposing.  Make sure it is the truth before being engaged/married to a pathological liar.\n\n*Edit: She didn't even know who the father was.\n\n**TL;DR: Friend was in a similar situation and found out girlfriend was a pathological liar, an addict, and willingly gave baby up.**",

            "What about your girlfriend's family? Have you not met them? Are they in on keeping her old life a secret?\n\nIs she hiding from them as well? And if so, is this because of the accident or for other reasons?\n\nThat she dealt with her grief by cutting people out of her life is pretty serious. She needs to deal with that before moving on with her life with you.",

            "Glad you figured it out. I'm amazed that you were so \"shocked\" that she had a life before you. This seems like an immature attitude and not conducive to seeing your SO as a separate person.\nThe fact that you got upset means you feel she 'owes' you her pain, and that's a pretty shitty place to start a relationship.\n\nEveryone has a life before they meet you and start dating you, and sharing her trauma is not something she owed you.\n\nNow that you do understand why she wouldn;t want to revisit a truly bad place, hopefully you've matured. This is like spouses of combat vets. They aren't going to tell you every goddamn detail just so you can feel like you've taken the complete \"tour\" of their psyche.\n\nI am always amazed at how callously and selfishly people view others' trauma, and how they think they must \"own\" everything about a significant other. Very controlling, immature behavior if you ask me.",
