You all gave me the courage I needed to message her.\n\nAfter I made the original post I gave him one more opportunity to come clean to his fianc\u00e9e. I confronted him and told him that the games had to stop. Either he told her or I did. He responded that I was bluffing, a bitch, and she wouldn't believe me.\n\nSo I sent her the screenshots of our conversations, and my phone number. I told her to call me if she had any questions regarding what I sent her.\n\nThe evidence was on my side, 90% of our recent conversation were filled with \"Are you sure you don't have a fianc\u00e9e?\" and him denying it and calling her *crazy*, *obsessed*, and that she needed to *let go*. \n\nI took a huge risk giving her my number. But the news I gave her needed to be discussed over the phone or in person. She called me an hour later. I expected her to be angry with me, possibly cuss me out. Call me a whore perhaps but she didn't. She cried for a long time and when she was able to speak she thanked me.\n\nWe talked for awhile about their relationship and about how she caught him talking to another girl in the past but let that one slide for the sake of her childern. This apparently was the icing on the cake. She added me on Facebook and when she broke up with him she went on Facebook and wrote about how she almost made the biggest mistake of her life. She personally tagged me and thanked me again that status. Felt a little weird about that but I rolled with it.\n\nIt wasn't two hours after that status was posted his messaged me and called me a stupid cunt. I was delusional and he never liked me. I ruined his relationship.. A load of bullshit. I sent her those messages and we laughed about it.\n\nWe may have met through weird circumstances but I may have made a new friend.\n\nI don't regret telling her one bit, she seems like a wonderful person and she didn't deserve what he was doing to her.\n\nTL;DR Guy tried cheating with me. Sent screenshots to his fianc\u00e9e, she was thankful that I told her. We bonded over his misery.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI hadn't even noticed that I misspelled  fianc\u00e9e (On mobile) Please excuse that error.. LOL\n\nEDIT 2:\nI've replied to **most** of the comments. I did not predict that I would get so many responses. I made this update to inform the ones that commented on the previous post or read it that everything had went well. \nThank you all for your kind praise. I don't regret the decision at all. If anyone is ever in this situation it may feel scary but it's the BEST decision you'll ever make. I hope and pray this guy isn't stupid enough to try cheating on his future girlfriends. With the technology these days one way or another you're going to get caught. ",

All of your comments were really appreciated and definitely helped me think. \n\nSo for the last week my ex has been staying with family when hes not at work and we have been sharing time with Sarah. We met up this weekend to talk about everything and our life plan. He basically said that he does still love me, but that his schedule is just not something that can change for him anytime soon. I am trying to be understanding and supportive, because I do want to be with him and Sarah. We are going to look into counseling for us as a couple, and also family counseling for the three of us.\n\nI did bring up legal adoption of Sarah. I was shocked when he said he was thinking of the same thing. He said that no matter what happens with us as a couple he always wants me to be a parental figure to Sarah. We had both hoped that someday I would adopt her, we just didn't see us breaking up or it becoming an issue. I am so glad we are on the same page about that. I am over the moon and were going to meet with a lawyer on Friday to get the ball rolling on that. \n\n\nI am hoping that this relationship can be saved because I really do feel like I have a family with them. My number one priority throughout this has been Sarah, and I am cant even explain how happy I am that I will get to legally be her parent. I know I wont ever be her mother but I'm glad that we will be together no matter what.\n\nThanks Reddit! Sorry this is kind of all over the place. We're still figuring everything out, but I wanted to update!\n\ntl;dr: We are going to start couples and family counseling, as well as beginning the process for legal adoption!\n\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for all your comments. This got bigger than I expected. Thanks for all the kind words. To people think that I am being taken advantage of for free child care please realize that I've happily cared for Sarah for the last 5 years and have no problem continuing to do so.

While it might be valid (he might be tired of your nagging) it sounds like the three of you have a family together. You're all but married in everything but name and legality. \n\nI've recently started working 7 days a week 60-75 hours. Its necessary right now. My family wants to make a cross country move and I want to make sure we have a massive cushion of finances to move on. I'm busy as hell. But I'd never divorce my wife because of it.\n\nHe moved out.

But this statement concerns me. Are you trying to keep the relationship alive just to stay with Sarah? A strong couple and family has the strongest base when the parents are the stable foundation. I think it would be healthy for you to devote positive energy for your boyfriend as well. But also, stop thinking of yourself as an outcast to the family, you are part of the family. I think if you feel like you do belong, you won't use such exit-plannish phrases. Food for thought. Take care.",

            "> I know I wont ever be her mother but I'm glad that we will be together no matter what.\n\nI don't really understand that sentence. Yes, you aren't and won't ever be her *biological* mother, but beyond that ...\n\n... you were her caregiver, from the sounds of it even primary caregiver, for as long as Sarah can remember. I fail to see how her relationship to you would be in any way different than that between mother and daughter. No matter what she calls you, I don't see how her feelings toward you could be any different than those towards a mother.\n\nThat's why a sentence from a reply to your previous thread really upset me:\n\n> But consider whether it means more to you than her. I remember being six years old but I don\u2019t have tons of memories from that time. There are lots of people that I were in my life but I can\u2019t necessarily remember those faces.\n\nIf your relationship to Sarah is even remotely as you described it, this would be vehemently untrue. Losing you would be like losing her mother at the age of six. It would not cripple her, but it would hurt and and it would leave a deep scar.\n\nI'm very happy you're working things out and I hope you can become and remain loving family unit again.",
            "wow, that is awesome.  I truly hope that you guys can save the relationship. Far too often these days, couples seem to give up,on committment when things get tough. Committment, to me, is figuring out how to make it work together when things are tough.\n\nIt sounds like you are on the same page regarding Sarah,so definitely move forward with that asap..that will help by providing a concrete, positive reason to keep working at the relationship through good times & bad. It also provides you and Sarah protection from a relationship standpoint if things go south permanently.  \n\nIt seems like you both want ghe same things - that is truly half the battle. Work with a therapist who can help you navigate some of the issues that may be causing strife. Best of luck to all of you.",
            "Sounds like a positive update, and I certainly wish you the best of luck, but I'm skeptical that you would be allowed to legally adopt Sarah if you and your ex are not actually still together.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but I'd encourage you to seek legal advice.\n\nEven short of that, though, it still might be possible for you to get some legal rights (visitation more likely than custody), especially if your ex is cooperative. Judges will consider the best interest of the child, and since you've raised her for 5 of her 6 years, they should certainly take that into account.\n\nGood luck.",
            "This is all great, but this is concerning:\n\n> My number one priority throughout this has been Sarah\n\nRemember, parents always put each other first before the kids. I know that sounds wrong, but it's not. You can't be an effective parent if your relationship with your partner is bad and you're burnt out and stressed about everything. You just can't, and it harms the kid more than anything. Please put your RELATIONSHIP first with the kid a close second.\n\nKind of like in an airplane, you put your own mask on before the kids. As a parent, i know we all would rather die than see our kids hurt, but you can more effectively help your kid by staying alive and being the best person overall that you can be.",
            "People are all like, \"oh, OP shouldn't put herself at legal risk by adopting Sarah\" \n\nBut it sounds like OP wants that legal risk because she loves her child. Would you tell a bio parent who could choose to tap out of legal responsibility for their child to do so? \n\nIt seems like both OP and her ex are agreed that Sarah needs her parent in her life. \n\nCongrats to you, OP, doing right by your kid. Screw the people who say she will forget you- I had a different primary caregiver from ages 1-7 vs. 7+, but I never forgot or stopped loving my first primary caregiver. I still miss her.",
            "Yay! It's great that he's on board with you continuing to be Sarah's parent regardless of what happens in the relationship.\n\nMaintaining a relationship is tough when you've got a kid and if he's working long hours and has a schedule that doesn't afford you two much time together. Hopefully through the counseling you'll find a healthy way to deal with your feelings about his work schedule and how to communicate them in healthy and non-destructive way, and he'll find a way to keep the romance alive in spite of the work schedule (or maybe even see the value in making a work schedule change). You didn't give many specifics about the situation, so it's hard to offer any ideas/compromises, but that's something you can work on in the couple's counseling.",
            "I'm really glad everyone has Sarah in their best interest! Good on you and him for for seeking therapy and willing to work together as team for her.",
            "Good to hear, congrats.  And... you may not be used to the idea yet, but as her adoptive mother, your mother-daughter relationship is just as real and valid as a biological one.  \n\nI also think it's reasonable for you to be hopeful that you will get back together.  For him to say that he wants you always to be in Sarah's life is *huge*, I really didn't expect that.  Let us know how that goes!",
            "You are her mother. The way you care about her makes it true. ",
            "Your first post hit home for me, my daughter is 5 years old and my husband, who is not her bio dad, has been with us from day one. She knows him as \"dad\" and they have a 100% father-daughter relationship. I can't imagine them being separated. I'm so happy things turned around for you guys!",
            "You adopting her while this relationship isn't stable, and actually in question, is a terrible idea. It's the equivalent of two people on the edge of divorce deciding to have a baby.\n\nHe's only agreeing to your parental involvement, so that no matter what happens to your relationship, he'll have a caregiver. I'm not saying that he's doing this intentionally, but at least subconsciously. It may be all good and well for her to have s mom, but ours better for her to not be dropped immediately into a divorced parent situation. You guys need to figure this relationship out asap, with absolutely no influence of there being a child involved.",
            "God damn it this is the most beautiful thing Ive read in months",
            "OP I really don't have much to add except that you are a good mum. Keep it up!",
            "Don't allow yourself to be a doormat or the only one trying to salvage things.\n\nFocus on your relationship with Sarah, not him. That is the most important thing here. I mean, I hope it works out for you, just tread carefully when it comes to your direct relationship with him.",
            "It sounds like you guys just need a little space for you to grow and then come back together. From my perspective (A man) if he wants you to be the mom of his child, he wants just as much to end up with you. \n\n100% respect your strength in this and your ability to care for Sarah. If it weren't for my step dad I never would have become a functioning or respectable man - I imagine that you will fill a similar role. You rock OP - and you've got a crazy good heart. ",
            "As someone who lost their mom early on in life (8yr old) I can tell you that she will see you as a mom. My dad was in a relationship with a woman for as long as I can remember (parents split when I was a baby) and I consider her my mom more so than my biological mom. Blood doesn't matter when it comes to who you see as a parent and I'm sure Sarah will be really glad to have a mom that cares about her as much as you clearly do. I hope things improve and I'm glad you can still be a mom to her!",
            "Take it from an uncle who became \"daddy\" because the father is never around and I live with her. You are the mother. You've done the work, you've provided her happiness, you've shown her something stable. \n\nTake this legal adoption and run with it. Then, if he ever gets pissy you will have rights. \n\nThis is something I wish the mods would waive their one update only rule on, I want to hear how this ends up happening. ",
            ">He said that no matter what happens with us as a couple he always wants me to be a parental figure to Sarah\n\nThat's what he says now, but will he say that 5 years down the line when he's married to someone else?  This is an easy choice when there is not another woman in his life.  I would strongly urge you to hold off on adoption; there's no reason you can't be in his daughter's life without a formal adoption and if you do adopt you're tying yourself to him forever which may not be good for anyone depending on what happens with your relationship and what other women get involved with him and therefore his daughter.",
            "Wow, what a tough situation. I have kids, so I know if I ever had to separate from them, I'd be devastated. I got a little misty reading that your BF is on board with you adopting Sarah and that you're spending good time with her still. Nothing but good wishes and prayers going to you!",
            "You don't break up with someone because they nag you. You discuss this problem like an adult and come to an agreement on how you can both move forward. I hope this comes to light for you/him when you go to counseling and you guys can learn how to communicate with each other. \n\nI'm glad you're going to get to stay in the girl's life because that will set her up for success. You guys need a strong coparenting, legal document to ensure things go well from this point forward, though. In the event that either of you end up marrying someone else, what happens with new relationships, how medical and other decisions will be made for her, etc. ",
            "I know you are coming from a place of love but I would caution you to step back for a moment and look at this ... for lack of a better world.... coldly.  What happens if you guys dont work out and someone else steps into her life turns her against you and suddenlybyou never see her as a teen yet you are legally and financially responsibke for her.  If you adopt her and split up you will most likely have to pay child support.   Its all great now when people are civil... until they aren't.  Im not saying its a bad idea.  Im just suggesting you consider all the possibilities.  I was in a similar situation.  Helped raise a child for 5 years...haven't seen them in 15...even though i tried.",
            "Oh my God I'm so happy for you!!! I just read your old post and my heart was breaking for you and for that little girl! You ARE her mother, you're the only thing she knows. How devastating if you just didn't get to be a part of her life anymore. I hope it works out for you soooooo much. <3",
            "OP, your post just made me tear up because I\u2019m so happy for you. \n\nGlad things are going well. I hope you two do reconcile and end up as a happy family.",
            "Good update.\n\nCounseling is a very good idea. Many marriages could be saved by early professional help.\n\nIf you experience hysterical bonding, don't use that to paper over your problems.\n\nThe fact that your a good mother is a reason that your boyfriend may still love you. That is only part of your relationship.",
            "For the record, biological or not. You are her mother. Don\u2019t sell yourself first. Parents put their children first which is exactly what you did you. You are as much her mother as any other mother and daughter. ",
            "Glad to see it work out for you :) ",
            "If you adopt Sarah and you guys split up you might be responsible for child support. \n\nYou should work on your relationship first, and only if it\u2019s going well should you consider adoption. ",
            "Thats a horrible update. You need to put Sarah first.  Unless you two can be a committed couple you should not consider adoption.  What happens if he has to move in the future, or finds someone else if you two arent together?  You need couples counseling first, then a commitment to a life together, then adoption.",
            "You definitely need to speak to a lawyer about everything. I know you love this child as if she were your own, but you need to prepare for all the possible outcomes.\n\nI would also be cautious on adopting the child. Your ex may just be screwing with you just to try to get you to pay child support for the kid, without you ever seeing her again.\n\nWhen you speak to the lawyer, you should set up a meeting alone without your ex present. Ask if you adopted the child how likely it would be for you to get joint custody if your ex and you don't actually get back together. You will most likely have to pay child support unless your ex doesn't ask for it. If he isn't willing to go through mediation or come up with a visitation plan and take it to the courts, you may be looking at thousands of dollars of legal fees and still end up with no visitation and having to pay child support. Would you want to pay child support for the next 12 years if you never see this child again?\n\nI would not sign any adoption papers until you are back in a good relationship with the guy.",
            "You adopt her and he can sue you for child support. Even if she turn into a bratty teen who non stop shouts \u201cyour not my mom!\u201d And refuses to see you. Just something to keep in mind. ",
            "\"I know I won't ever be her mother.\" Yes, you will. That's what happens when adoption takes place. You will be her mother.\n",
            "I wish you all the best \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude18 I hope you guys will have a better relationship \u2764\ufe0f",
            "A very good sign of progress and good things to come!!",
            "What a fantastic update. \n\nJust remember that, with his busy schedule, if you do get back with your ex, he needs some personal time. Dont push him away again, I know it can be hard when you feel like you barely see him, but just remind yourself that everyone needs that little bit of time to themselves to recover. ",
            "This is the kind of ending that warms even the coldest of cynic's hearts",
            "This made me want to cry\n\nThe love of my life has a daughter of his own, and she's similar age and whilst I would never, ever pretend to be a mother to her as she has her own, I fell in love with her the day I met her and we're awfully close. This situation that you're in is terrifying, but your ex seems to have a very good  heart, as do you, of course. Good luck to you all.",
            "Great update, I hope everything works out wonderfully!",
            "I recommend again the adoption unless you marry. He's using you for free childcare. If you weren't in the picture he'd have to give up this job he loves. The one he broke up with you over.  Don't you see that he can't break up with you because you enable his fancy-free lifestyle?  That's why he is trying to lock you down legally.  Once you adopt, he can dump you and keep his nanny.",
            "[deleted]",
            "FWIW, the economy is pushing people back into the direction of something like traditional gender roles. There are lots of good well-paying jobs with promising career paths being created, but they are too demanding to have anything that can be called work-life balance. I wouldn't be surprised if your next boyfriend winds up being someone else in that situation. \n\nIf the relationship is ever to be resurrected, I would say the only realistic possibility is for you two get married, and for you to accept his schedule. Marriage is, fundamentally, a contract, and if you are going to give first priority in your life to Sarah, rather than building a career, then you need that contract. Devoting your life to raising someone else's child, without getting any kind of commitment in return, to me just sounds like a bad deal. "

Here\u2019s the issue:\n\nShe has a younger brother I\u2019ve known about since we\u2019ve dated in college. He\u2019s a very low functioning autistic, to the extent that he will need full-time supervision and care for the rest of his adult life. He\u2019s a sweetheart and a great kid, and he and my fianc\u00e9 are about as close as siblings can get. \n\nWe want kids, but whenever we get on the topic she brings up her brother and talks about how \u201cyou won\u2019t even notice he\u2019s there\u201d and that \u201che can really take care of himself, he just needs some supervision is all.\u201d I\u2019ve taken a lot of time to consider it, and as much as I like her brother, I\u2019m not marrying her for her family. \n\nShe wants us to take care of him alongside our children, to live with us as soon as I\u2019m done with Med school until presumably we die. \n\nI\u2019ve told her I love her brother, but I don\u2019t want him to live with us and our kids, if we choose to have them.

            "My friend has 2 autistic siblings who require full-time care, and their parents are older. She got married a couple years ago. One thing she made clear to her husband from when they started dating was that she was going to take over caring for her siblings one day. He decided he was okay with that and married her knowing that was their plan. This really is something that needs to be worked out before marriage though, and it\u2019s not really an area where you two can compromise. Taking care of a disabled person is hard work, and you\u2019ll resent her if you get forced into it, but she\u2019ll resent you if she has to put her brother in a care home. This might be a situation where your goals are just not compatible, and it is a deal breaker.",
            "This is a deal breaker.   The only way you can go forward with this relationship and your planned marriage is if you are 100% OK with you and your fianc\u00e9 being lifetime guardians and care givers for the brother.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t something that you can change her mind on without a lifetime of resentment.  \n\nEven if parents continue to care for the boy they will get too old to do so someday and this subject is certain to resurface in the future.  \n\nI feel sorry for you as you have a very serious decision to make.  Think of the life you want and choose wisely.",

            "I'm sorry to tell you, but this sounds like an incompatibility and may mean the end of your relationship...",
            "This is not going to change.  It will just divide your relationship further.  You could compromise and let him live with you but you will resent him and eventually her.  You might not ever say anything but your children and the brother will pick up on it.  You don't HAVE to do anything.",
            "You might not be able to live together if you can't live with your brother in law and she is determined that she should care for him.\nIt's unfortunate but you must resolve this before you get married.\nNobody's bad or wrong but you both have to decide it this is a deal breaker.",
            "Your fianc\u00e9 needs to have this conversation with her parents. She needs to know what their plans are, and what arrangements/plans are in place for her brother should her parents not be able to care for him.\n\nDepending on your relationship dynamic, perhaps you could also be part of this conversation. It might be helpful for you to hear it directly from her parents, and not through her as a translator.\n\nBut this is a conversation that needs to happen. It\u2019s actually way overdue. She shouldn\u2019t be feeling this pressure or framing this fantasy without a very clear conversation with her parents.",
            "You're free to leave if you don't want to care for him. You might just be incompatible. Nobody is \"wrong\" here. She's not wrong to want to care for him. You're not wrong to say no. She's either being dishonest, though, or extremely naive to claim you \"won't even notice\" he's there. If this is what she truly wants, it just means that marriage should not be in the cards for you two. She needs to use that as a learning experience though and be clear about that from the get-go with anyone she dates in the future (not tell someone this as they plan a life together). This is something she should have told you LONG before you got engaged. I would just tell her: \"I am not equipped to care for him. This is not something I can do or want to do. If this is something you insist on doing, then I respect that but it means we won't be together.\" It's not an ultimatum. It's just the truth.",
            "We all have deal breakers. This is clearly one for her. Decide if this is one for you. If it is that's fine. If you think you can live with taking care of her brother with all the money, restrictions, etc. that it will require than do that. Don't marry each other with both of you thinking the other person will change their mind in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes people love each other but they have deal breakers about money, children, religion, etc. That's fine, so long as everyone is on the same page.",
            "> I\u2019ve taken a lot of time to consider it, and as much as I like her brother, I\u2019m not marrying her for her family.\n\nYeah...so you may not be marrying her for her family, but her family is a part of the deal. At some point her parents will pass, and unless he dies before them, responsibility for caring for him will pass on to the two of you. That's basically inevitable.\n\nThat she wants him to move in well before that eventuality is something that you can try and convince her is unwise and unnecessary. You've received some solid advice on how to approach that topic. But at some level, they're a package deal. Her relationship with her brother will impact where you can move and a host of other decisions down the line. You need to be ok with that.",
            "You'd seriously bet better off ending this relationship if you don't want the brother.  She'll just resent you, and or force it upon you when her parents die.  I don't blame you either",
            "I have an autistic brother, and I made it very clear to my boyfriend early on in the relationship that if anything ever happens to my parents, and they're not there anymore. I am going to take care of my brother, as in, he will live with us. I'll work and look after him to the best of my abilities... My boyfriend was very supportive and loves my baby brother...But I can assure you if he had had any doubts, i would have ended the relationship right there in those early stages because I have always known I was going to look after my brother.\n\nI don't know what else to say other than, this isn't something that can be compromised on. You and your fiance need to talk  and reach a decision wisely.",
            "Speaking from my experience working in a care home for adults with disabilities - if he is actually what is known as \"low functioning\", she's absolutely wrong that her brother \"just needs some supervision is all\".\n\nIt's a full-time job. All of the residents still had family visits and/or outings, so it's not like they get sent off somewhere and never see their family again. But taking care of adults in that position is hard work and honestly - there are times where I had to clock out an hour early because I just couldn't handle it at the end of a particularly stressful shift.\n\nThere are plenty of people that take care of family members with different impairments. But it's a hell of a commitment and if you're both not 100% onboard, you will build resentment and it will kill your relationship.",
            "You both have the right to feel and want what you want.  To be fair, parents don\u2019t live forever.  So at some point he\u2019s going to need a caregiver.  This may be a non-negotiable for her.  I also don\u2019t blame her.  And you may have had the expectation that you aren\u2019t marrying her family... it doesn\u2019t matter who you marry, you basically are.",
            "Don\u2019t marry her with hopes of her changing her mind, she wants to take care of her brother, when her parents get too old or pass away you will be taking care of him a 100%. If you\u2019re not willing to do that don\u2019t continue this relationship because clearly this is a dealbreaker for her and you have to be honest with yourself if you really don\u2019t want to take care of him not now not in a future.",
            "So my twin brother is autistic and from my experience, her saying that nobody would notice her brother being around is highly unrealistic. The time and energy that an autistic person that needs special care requires is a lot. With my brother as context, you have: doctors appointments (if a specialist, there could be a lot of travel involved), special medications that have to be taken on time, meetings with social workers and other carers (my brother had a gentleman whose role was to take my brother out so that we as a family got a break, but we also had many discussions with this gentleman about my brother and how he was doing etc), any special needs regarding bathing and grooming (for example, my brother needed assistance with shaving), etc. So this WOULD impact your time with your children and together as a couple. That's simply a fact.\n\nIf you live in a place with poor healthcare, there are also those funds to consider. Such as medication costs. \n\nAlso, what are your guys' expectations regarding care for both sets of aging parents? That could be an issue as well.\n\nPersonally, I would take the time to sit her down and present your thoughts to her again. Tell her whether or not it is a dealbreaker and go from there. It really sounds like not having her brother in the home with her is a dealbreaker, but if you feel she might change her mind or compromise, I urge you to speak to a therapist or other professional trained in autism care together.",
            "I have a son with special needs as well as two daughters. I have made it clear that his mother and are taking great steps to ensure that they will never have to support him. They might one day be the ones making decisions for him, to the point even of custodial responsibility. But they won't have to open their homes to him. He's my son, not theirs.\n\nYour future in-laws should have been on this. \n\nThis is one you absolutely must solve before getting married. And if she relents and accepts that he can't stay with you, be very clear about what that means - he can't stay with you for more than four nights in a month and two weeks in a year. And make it clear to her that this isn't something you're going accept 'over time' so that she doesn't harbor hopes of 'wearing you down.' Even go so far to write something down and get her to sign it. \n\nIf she says you're asking her to choose between him and you, well, she can't marry both of you. (She can't marry her brother anyways but you see my point). She has to choose between having a new family with you or raising her old family.",
            "So I have a younger autistic sister and this has always been my plan. To take over her care. \n\nAs such I did exactly what your fiance did. Spoke to my husband about the future. He decided he was ok with it. So we moved forward. If he hadn't been it would have been a deal breaker. \n\nThat being said my mum doesn't want my sister to affect my life negatively and so has worked to get her into assisted living. Which is where she is now. We see her multiple times a week. I take her out on day trips etc. And actually I think that's better. At the end of the day she is only 2 years younger than me. How would I take care of her when I'm 74 and she is 72? I might not be capable. I may have my own health concerns etc. \n\nMaybe talk about this possibility. What if she physically can't care for her brother in the future. See if she is willing to work on a different plan? If not unfortunately you aren't compatible. It's sad. But it doesn't make either of you bad people.",
            "It is heartbreaking, but her brother needs full time care, and your fiancee is unrealistic when she says \"you won't even notice that he's there.\"  Ignoring her brother and not noticing that he's even there is NOT the level of love and care that he deserves.\n\nYour fiancee is very attached to him, but ask her to make a decision that's *best for him*.  If she loves her brother, she should make a decision that's best for him.\n\nAnd to see what's best for him, look at what level of care you can provide, vs. what her parents or professionals in a nursing or special-needs facility can provide.  There's love all around, you love her brother, she loves her brother, her parents love her brother; there's love all around, the difference is in the level of care and attention that he can GET, that he deserves.\n\nYou're starting a new family with her.  You'll have kids, they'll wake you up at all hours of the night.  You have jobs, you'll be tired, you won't even have much time for each other once your married life gets going.\n\n*The two of you* do not have the capacity to provide full care for her brother.  The two of you.  Do not.\n\nArgue it from this point of view.  She will likely reject this argument, she will likely try to bargain with you.  Let her, let her think about it, argue about it, let her work out her feelings.  She needs to let go, and there's loss and grief in that, it'll take some time.  Give her time.\n\nBut don't move forward with the relationship until this is resolved.  If your wedding is imminent, postpone it.  You cannot proceed until she lets go, and if she doesn't, you cannot proceed.\n\nI'm sorry.",

            "Hello, you\u2019re basically me.\n\nLet\u2019s talk.\n\nMy advice to you being in this exact same situation, if you don\u2019t want to do it make it VERY CLEAR RIGHT NOW.\n\nIf it\u2019s a make or break for your fianc\u00e9 then it\u2019s over because you clearly don\u2019t want to do this and keep in mind you don\u2019t have to.\n\nBut it\u2019s likely you won\u2019t be able to have both her AND not have the responsibility because she has probably signed up for this a long time ago.\n\nWas it not discussed at all while you were dating? Because you\u2019re engaged now. My partner certainly didn\u2019t bring it up with me at all and I was completely blindsided and it fucked us up real bad.\n\nIt\u2019s a hard pill to swallow that this might be a make or break, but do not feel guilty at all for not being able to take it on or not wanting to. YOU ARE NOT OBLIGATED. Repeat that one more time.\n\nNot everyone is cut out for being a caregiver and that\u2019s 100% a-okay. Someone with special needs should be with someone who wants to actually help them anyways and who knows how.\n\nIt\u2019s especially difficult when they\u2019re low functioning. Around the clock care is no fucking joke and there are habits and behaviors that might need to be continually kept in check.\n\nCaregiver burnout and resentment/hatred are also very real. This might also always be an area of contention between the two of you too.\n\nDoing this til you die? It sounds pretty fucking miserable. I know that in my situation, we tried it for a while but I ended up being depressed and suicidal.\n\nPlease don\u2019t be like me and let it get to that point. Save yourself a lot of pain and cut the chord fast if you absolutely don\u2019t ever want to do this.\n\nMy question is how do her parents feel about it? What do they have prepared for him? It\u2019s their main responsibility since he\u2019s their child.\n\nIs it a make or break for your fianc\u00e9? And how is she handling you saying no besides crying?\n\nWhat\u2019s a compromise you guys can consider?\n\nJust so you know, my partner told me I didn\u2019t love them and basically told me they\u2019d cheat on me or leave me for someone else.\n\nThey became outright abusive and her entire family is mad at me about it, but ironically even with all her other siblings and extended relatives, not a single person called to offer help or sent a SINGLE PENNY to contribute to their care.\n\nNot even my partner was dedicated to the siblings care. She just stuffed them in a room and made sure they had food. She\u2019d verbally abuse him to the point he felt he couldn\u2019t advocate for himself and they\u2019d bicker all the time.\n\nShe also expected me to just foot the living costs as well while her sibling used their government funds on useless unnecessary things to hoard in the house.\n\nIt was a real fucking mess. No mature conversations could be had, no rules or boundaries put in place because my partner refused to.\n\nUltimately I put my foot down because I was suicidal and I refused to die over something that ultimately wasn\u2019t my responsibility and I couldn\u2019t handle financially or mentally.\n\nI don\u2019t know what your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family is like, but keep saying no if you can\u2019t ever see yourself doing this. You have the luxury to not take this on. That is a gift that many people, including your fianc\u00e9 will likely never have.\n\nTheir autistic sibling is the hill they choose to die on and they have a right to do that, but you also have the right to the future and the life of peace that you want.\n\nIt\u2019s a painful and terrible position to be in for the both of you.\n\nI know it fucking sucks and a lot of people would probably be quick to defend the special needs person over you, but someone else\u2019s tragedy doesn\u2019t necessarily equal your responsibility.\n\nIf you want to PM me to chat about it I\u2019m here dude.",

            "Please read: I have an mentally disabled 27yr old daughter and a healthy 22yr old son. I get where your fiancee is coming from. I get that her parents are getting old and it will get more and more difficult and eventually they can't do the care any more. I have dreamed f my son being the caretaker of my daughter one day (as a far away dream, not anything pursued) when he was a teen. But then I realised that this would not be fair. not fair on my son AND not fair on my daughter. My son doesn't want to stay in one place when he finishes university. he wants to work everywhere in the world and I will not destroy his dreams. OTOH disabled people need routine, the same sheltered workshop, the same environment etc. Plus - a mentally disabled person needs just that: a sheltered workshop or a sheltered special daycare to give them a fulfilled life.\n\nMy son is her brother. It WILL BE his responsibility to make sure my daughter is safe and happy one day (as best he can). But that doesn't mean HE must DO the caring. We are on a waiting list for group-living (post-covid). Not because we don't want our daughter with us any longer. Her room will always be her room, she will be home on some weekends or holidays etc. But we want her to HAVE a place to call home that is HERS and most important BEFORE anything goes wrong. We want to go slowly. Have trial stays and see she is happy there. We want to have the chance to pull back and say \"let us try another one\" until it fits. If we wait until we are dead, she won't have that time and slow progression. That would not be fair not only on her, but on my son, too. \n\nMy son's job when we are gone one day will be to call her regularly and to check on her occasionally UNANOUNCED so that he knows she is safe and happy where she is. If he lives overseas, he has cousins that will help on the occasional check and to invite her over every few months. the cherry on the cake is if he and his cousins would take turns in taking her in for Christmas or showing up and inviting her to a movie for her birthday. I hope that that will happen.\n\nPlease show your fiancee this post. It is time for her to talk to her parents about a solution. as a compromise, you can offer to take her brother in every other weekends (many group homes make trips and other special things to help the group bonding on the weekends, so go by bi-weekly weekend-home-trips). Her brother could call your place \"home\" but you two can live your life, too.\n\nImportant: there are care levels of assisted living situation.s and they change as the person improves. I.e he can start in a \"family-like\" closely monitored group, where there is a caretaker present at all times. then there are groups where the caretaker only comes in once in the evening to talk about schedules or appointements, updates a chore-list etc. The people are like room-mates at college. they have their own personal space and a shared living situation- but they have somebody to overlook it all. The last \"stage\" before real independence are if they have their own individual apartments and a caretaker comes in once or twice a week to ask if there are any problems etc.\n\nIf your fiancee gets her brother in one of those group programs HE CAN GROW. And who knows what he is capable of. He might be fine on his own one day if he isn't coddled.",

Maybe you could start having her brother stay with you guys every other weekend. It might be that she is feeling very worried about her parents getting older and not being able to take care of him as they age. Starting slow might be best, both to help reassure your wife that you still want her brother to be a part of your family & want to support her parents, but also to open the door to discussion of more options. \n\nPlease look into the other options though, and remember having a child with special needs means her parents have sacrificed their entire life for him.

Since OP reports that they spend a lot of time together and are very close, it's likely she has been pretty up front all along.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that families of people with special needs are always trying to anticipate needs and they worry about their loved one's future. The brother will require care for the rest of his life, and sooner or later it will fall to the sister to be his advocate and govern his situation. \n\n\"A is for Autism\" does a good job of presenting the type of sibling relationship that it seems these two in the OP share. Truthfully, they do a spectacular job of highlighting a lot of things without being too sappy or overly dramatic. \n\nIf she has always been instinctively responsible and sensitive to his needs, she has more than a typical sibling bond and likely there are some almost parental overtones involved. For the fur parents, think of a dog that you had to bottle feed who is now 9 years old.\n\nAnd how many people in the world broke up with someone because of something dog-related ... let's just say in the last two hours? \n\nOP doesn't have to stay in the relationship, but I think that if he wants to, he's going to have to find a way to sincerely embrace the idea of the autistic brother as part of the package.

            "I have a severely Autistic brother and I will eventually be his guardian. It's part of the package. My husband knows this and is comfortable with it. If you want to marry her, you need to understand the depth of her commitment to her brother. Prepare yourself that there is a good chance that he will eventually live with you, alongside your children. Yes, it might be \"presumably until you die.\" If you marry her, he will be a huge part of your life. That doesn't mean that the burden should fall completely on your wife- she needs to make sure she is aware of the social services that are available to her to help care for him. She does not have to take this completely on her shoulders. \n\nBut the thing that bothers me about this is that it's incredibly naive of her to assume that that removing her brother from his home and care-takers is what is right for him. Honestly, that could be extremely detrimental to him. What do her parents think about her plan? Having young children and being a caretaker to an adult with those needs is an incredible stressor. I know that I could probably not have cared for my brother when I was having my kids. She sounds really really naive. If her brother needs constant support, how will you barely notice he is there? And there are some complicated legal matters that need to be sorted out if she wants to take guardianship from her parents. Why does she want to it so soon? Is she unhappy with his care? \n\nI'm conflicted because I do get the vibe that you are uncomfortable with him living with you, but I also get the feeling that her expectations of him living with her so soon are unreasonable. I think you need to ask more specific questions about her plan for his long-term care, and find out what her parents think about all of this. Don't be dismissive, this is incredibly important to her. But you also need to figure out, are you truly OK with this? He won't be an accessory in her life, in your children's life. If her parents' circumstances change suddenly, are you willing to take him in? What if it was next week? Don't get married until you have decided on a specific plan for caring for her brother and your roles in that. But you will be part of that care-taking team if you marry her. Are you really ok with that?\n\nMy brother is a full-time commitment, but he has also enriched my life and my family's lives. He brings me and my family a lot of joy. His role in my life has brought more empathy, more compassion and tolerance to my husband and children. Care-taking is an incredible burden, but there is love and happiness too. He is an incredible commitment, but he is a vital part of who I am, who my husband fell in love with. I suspect this is true for your fiance too.",

That does not mean we will be caring for my brother immediately (he is higher functioning and is enjoying life with my parents now - he holds down two part time jobs and they travel).  But obviously that will not last forever and we are not naive to think my parents will always be fully capable of caring for him.\n\nI\u2019m surprised that OP and his fianc\u00e9 have only had this conversation a few times - her brother and the life she has had growing up with him is part of her identity, and OP cannot change that.  I\u2019m also a little surprised at the seeming lack of empathy to the situation and the language used (not to be the language police, but her brother is a man with autism, not an autistic) - it might be a seemingly small thing but it\u2019s important to remember that the fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother is a human being first, and autism does not define him.  I agree with some other comments that if the OP cannot accept that there will come a time when all options will need to be on the table in terms of deciding the best care and path forward for the fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother, this really might not be a resolvable issue.\n\nOP - your fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother will be in your life until you or he passes - he needs to and will become your family once you get married - please try and start to view him through the eyes of your fianc\u00e9 - we all make sacrifices, and as a sibling to a brother with Down Syndrome, I can tell you that she has grown up with the knowledge that her brother\u2019s care will become her responsibility at one point or another.

She's had all 21 years to do so, whereas you have had far less.\n\nShe needs to understand the dynamic she has with her brother, and the dynamic her parents have with him. On the surface level, her idea sounds great: bring him in, he can just take care of himself, you won't ever know he's there. But how do you make sure he isn't lighting the stove and leaving it? Leaving the house and getting lost? Getting into things he shouldn't? If you just pretend he's not there, are you really \"taking care of him\"?\n\nHer heart is in the right place, your mind is too.

Having a worst case scenario plan in place so it's possible to take him in if absolutely necessary is a big compromise on your behalf and she either needs to accept those terms or make a decision.",
            "I\u2019m sorry but she acts like he wouldn\u2019t be any work or be noticed. Even a person that doesn\u2019t have special needs makes a big impact on your relationship and household. She hasn\u2019t taken care of him on her own yet. You will be working crazy hours once you get your first job. If you have children it will be even harder. Can you live close to her parents so you can see him multiple times a week and he could visit in certain days. Why does she think she has to take over for her parents and why now? Are they struggling to do so because of their age?  Also, an autistic individual finds comfort in a set schedule will she be able to continually provide that for him especially if you are working many hours? Does she plan on being home as not  working to care for him?",
            "It's not on to expect such a sacrifice from you. \n\nIt IS very difficult looking after someone who is disabled and more so if low functioning.\n\nThat cannot be overstated.\n\nIt's a very big deal. \n\nI am disabled and need a lot of support, my ex partner of 14 years did so but it didn't make our relationship either as partners or his being my carer any easier. \n\nWe ended up as little more than angry resentful house mates. \n\nEven if you got carers,encouraged the brother to learn how to be a bit more independent and made sure that you had all of his appointments and medical information and meds down to the T, it is a lot, and of all three of you will grow older. \n\nAnd would your potential children come first, last or nowhere at all? \n\nThey remember their childhood..",

            "If one person isn't fully on board it's a no go. It will destroy the marriage.  Your honesty is commendable and I hope she can appreciate that.",
            "You need to have a serious conversation with your SO, because this isn't something you can compromise on and you shouldn't get married yet. \n\nIt is a tough situation because I see both sides. But ultimately, you know what you can live with and if you can't handle her brother, you shouldn't have to. Likewise if she feels like she needs to care for him, then she needs to do that. Ultimately this is going to end with either you agreeing to pay for care for him in a home, or you splitting up\n\nIt is a tough conversation. My SO has siblings and due to an issue it was a possibility they may have been put in foster care temporarily, or family could take them. I had to sit down with him and explain that I love him but under no circumstances would be willing to take in his siblings. It was tough because essentially it was either he agrees or we split. And you can't force your SO into agreeing with you, she has to come to that conclusion on her own",
            "I think it's important to look at what you fiance wants for future self.  Does she want to have a career outside of the home, or does she want to be a SAHW/M?  Because I'm assuming that you want to be a doctor or surgeon, which would mean many long hours, with her taking care of the kids and the house and the brother by herself, or with some hired help if that's an option.  You can try the argument that just because her brother is housed in a group home where he can be taken care of doesn't mean she/you love him any less, but if she's dead set on this being the rest of her life, then the two of you are unfortunately very incompatible and it's time to move on.",
            "You're going to be a doctor... what's your evaluation of how much care he will need?\n\nAlso, you're going to make a lot of money. I don't have experience with low functioning autism, but I'm guessing you will be able to afford an in-home nurse or caregiver. \n\nYou will also have enough money to get a house that will help facilitate this kind of care. \n\nMy BIL is a doctor and his parents live with them. Of course, they are part of the family, but he and my sister built a little wing in their house with its own washer dryer, kitchen area, bedroom, bathroom and a living room, so his parents can choose to hang out with the larger family or relax in their own area. \n\nYou could build him a similar little wing and with a bedroom for the in-home caregiver with her own kitchen, bathroom, living room and laundry--and with a bedroom, bathroom and living room for your future BIL, as well. My advice isn't to ostracize him to a corner of the house and act like he's not there, btw. I'm saying you can make him part of the family while creating accommodations and space for everyone involved. \n\nYour future salary gives you a lot of options that are not available to the average person.  If you want to stay with your fiance, I think you should consider solutions and start planning for them financially.",
            "Hey, your \u201cif we decide to have them\u201d comment about kids is something you\u2019re gonna want to figure out now. Before you get married. Like that and this thing with her brother both need to be dead and buried before you get married. \n\nIt\u2019s ok if you, or she doesn\u2019t want to have kids. I\u2019m r/childfree but there are other subs like r/fencesitter Thing is, this isn\u2019t gonna go away and it might not just be ok. People get divorced all the time because one wanted kids and the other didn\u2019t. Best case is that you\u2019re both on the same page but if you\u2019re not it\u2019s best to find out before you do the ceremony and paperwork.",
            "I don't want to sound rude but this seems like a pretty cut and dry situation to me? You want different things, there's no reasonable compromise. You don't need our permission to break up with your fianc\u00e9e. Seems you just need to actually make the decision and deal with the consequences, whichever you decide to do.",
            "Think carefully about if you want that to be your life",
            "So, I\u2019m going to answer as someone who is destined to take care of their adult sibling with autism. He stays with me a week out of every month so far. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that this wasn\u2019t something that was brought up earlier. I\u2019m not in anyway implying your spouse is a bad person but this is extremely important and a huge thing to leave until you are about to get married. \n\nHowever, she is not wrong. This is the reality of being with someone who has siblings with autism. Yes, they can be taken care of by the state to some degree. Will it be a comfortable life? To an extent. Depends where you live. A lot of places provide the bare minimum and I\u2019ve seen people who should have full time supervision walking around town on their own, getting robbed and/or abused. They could go to a care home and that could be fine, to an extent. Again, depends on the care home. There is lots of abuse that goes on in care homes or home shares. People like to pretend it doesn\u2019t exist, but it does and it\u2019s actually a huge issue. It\u2019s easy to be abusive to lower functioning individuals. It happens all the time. These are the things your fianc\u00e9 is probably worried about. These are the things I think about a lot. She wants to *know* that he is safe. \n\nThe thing is, when you have been a \u201ccare giver\u201d/older sibling to someone like this it takes a huge chunk of you. You will worry almost as if you are the parents. You take on this weight like a mountain in your heart and you come to the understanding that you are simply the person who will need to step up, without question. This may seem weird to a lot of people and yeah, it may NOT be our responsibility but we deeply feel it is. You couldn\u2019t convince us otherwise. \n\n(Note: I understand not literally everybody feels this way about their siblings but it\u2019s common.)\n\nYou are going to have to make a tough choice because acting in any way like you can tell her no or like this isn\u2019t going to happen regardless of you isn\u2019t going to work. You will wreck your relationship in a way you\u2019ll never fix and from the sounds of it, you\u2019ve already started going down that path. \n\nNeither of you are wrong but neither of you are the final decision either in this when it comes to this relationship. This is simply and only a break up for good or decide to go for it situation. I wish the best for you, your fianc\u00e9 and her brother.",
            "One thing you will have to come to terms with is she will have to be his care giver after they are gone/can\u2019t because I am sure she is not going to want to put him in a home. \n\nI could see your frustration from her wanting to push it so early on At least that\u2019s what I am getting out of it but maybe you should just talk to her. Tell her you\u2019re not ready to take on that next obstacle yet but you are willing to talk about taking care of him if no one else can.",
            "It's sad but you know what will happen when her parents are older and unable to care for him. Or God forbid something happens to them.\n\nI understand that you love her and want to be with her but man, med school, a family and a romantic relationship with your wife will already take more than all of your time. A special needs adult is A LOT to add.",
            "\"I'm not marrying her for her family\" is a huge red flag for me. It's not about what her family wants it's about what she wants",
            "All I can say is relationships have ended over a lot less, and most relationships do end. I wouldn\u2019t compromise on something like this because if you do, it will make you miserable and you\u2019ll start to resent your fianc\u00e9/wife. It will cause fights and she\u2019ll just see you as the problem because \u201cyou agreed to it in the first place\u201d. Cut the cord and move on, you\u2019re only 24 man. Still got so many years to find someone who doesn\u2019t come with this huge baggage.",
            "My siblings were normal kids but I still took over a large portion of their care once I turned 18, (they were all much younger) and I made it perfectly clear that if there was ever a point where I had to choose between my siblings or a lover it'd be the lover who would be kicked to the door. Even though it hurt I had to make that choice a few times over the years but as far as I was concerned it *wasn't there fault they were born.* I on the other hand *could* choose what I wanted to do.\n\nI don't think either of you are at fault, but honestly it sounds like your incompatible. Maybe you guys could work out a compromise that once parents start to get older he can come permantly and until then a guest room can be created to visit whenever and have mini vacations with you guys or maybe not. Either way it sounds like this is something that can't be ignored and needs to be seriously addressed, since one of you will be massively unhappy with the results.",
            "You aren\u2019t compatible.  Full stop.\n\nShe\u2019s planning ahead.  Eventually the parents will die and he will need care, falling on her.  And she accepts that.  If you can\u2019t accept that this is not the woman to spend your life with.\n\nJust gonna say it\u2019s a pretty shit attitude to say you \u201caren\u2019t marrying her family\u201d.  She loves these people!  They are part of her life and you knew this the *entire time* you dated! \nI suggest only dating people estranged from their families moving forward.",
            " I have a mentally challenged brother so I somewhat understand the situation. You two need to talk and see if either or both of you can or cannot compromise and on what in DETAIL. Seriously, both of you need to lay out clear expectations as to what kind of life you're getting into if you do decide do move forward.\n\nThis isn't meant as suggestion, it's just an example to illustrate my point. If she where to compromise on not living with her brother but living near him and caring for him (maybe having him over a lot) and you compromise with that limitation on how and where you can live then you two would have to plan that out and have clear boundaries and expectations for each other's role as far as time commitments and living arrangements. \n\nIf neither of you are willing to compromise then you shouldn't force it, it's understandable from both sides that this issue can be non-negotiable. Whatever you do it's important to not leave anything vague, and since her parents are part of the equation it would be wise to involve them as far as well.",
            "There has to be some compromise here. That compromise will no doubt involve him living with you at some point but what you might be able to control is when he does, not if he does.",
            "NAH\n\nThis is the kind of fundamental incompatibility that means you shouldn't get married.  Period.\n\nYou should gently tell your fiancee, \"I've given it a lot of thought and, unfortunately, I don't believe I'll ever be okay with having us be responsible for your brother's care insomuch as having him live in our house full-time.  I know that's something that's important to you.  I think we need to have a discussion so we can come to a compromise before we get married.\"\n\n(IMO, a reasonable compromise might be to help support BIL while he lives in a group home nearby and visit/have him visit often.)",
            "Has she even talked to her parents about taking in her brother soon? It feels like she has just made this decision without talking to anyone or really even thinking it through. You don't just take kids from their parents because you might have to take care of them one day. Maybe you should talk to her parents so they can shut this down.",
            "Have you two had a conversation with her parents? This reads more like this is something she wants to do but as parents they probably have already planned for this. I would sit down with them and explain your fianc\u00e9es desire to take care of him but before you discuss it further wanted to know if they had a plan and what their expectations are.",
            "This would be a deal breaker for me if this was something she insisted on. If he's low-functioning, then he likely cannot, in fact, \"take care of himself\" and you will, in fact notice him there--that's why he needs supervision. \n\nI think she is downplaying how much work and effort it is going to require and, although this may sound mean, it's not your responsibility. I don't blame her for wanting to be sure her brother is well taken care of, but unless you are enthusiastic about doing so, then the answer has to be no and she can decide whether/how to proceed. \n\nPersonally, I don't see any legitimate reason why he should live with you. He's a human being, not a house cat your fiancee can just schlep around whenever her life circumstances change. If his parents treat him well, provide for him, and give him a stable, healthy, clean, environment, then why mess that up? If you want to have kids, how would loud, noisy, dirty, screaming kids impact a low-functioning person with autism? I don't imagine the (normal) chaos that children invite would be particularly good for a person with autism. If he, for example, doesn't like to be touched, how would it be for him to live in an environment with small children who don't understand personal boundaries? It just seems like it would be so disruptive for him, having lived his life with the way his parents do things, to suddenly having to conform to a new house, new sets of rules, new expectations, new environment, new people, etc. It makes me wonder whether your fiancee even thought about what it would be like for her brother or whether she's a little too self absorbed. \n\nMaybe your fiancee is just worried about not being able to see him as often as she does now, in which case the answer is not to move him in with you, but for her to make a greater effort to see him. I don't know how old her parents are, but if yall are in your 20's they can't be that old, so maybe in 30-40 years him living with you can be revisited if her parents are no longer able to care for him.",
            "bro my brother is autistic, this is 100% a conversation you have with your SO before you get engaged. She has been extremely up front about her brothers needs so you have known what you're signing up for. This isn't something that's gonna get better or go away if you ignore it. Eventually her parents are gonna pass on.",
            "this is up to you\n\nif its a dealbreaker leave\n\nif its not a dealbreaker and youre prepared to take care of her brother for the rest of your life then stay",
            "Your in laws are going to die someday, then what?\n\nSounds like you should reconsider this marriage.",
            "Has she actually asked her brother if he would want to? I mean, he's autistic and presumably doesn't really want to completely change everything about his life - that's a huge expectation for him to be comfortable with, never mind the attributes of autism and how change is handled. \n\nIt seems to me like she's made this decision herself without even considering how her brother feels about her plan. He might want to carry on living with his parents and not move out. \n\nIt seems a little inconsiderate to her brother",
            "Unfortunately I think this is the hill to die on. How is there a compromise here, what's the middle ground some one said it earlier resentment ether way.",
            "Are the parents aware of this plan?",
            ">I\u2019ve told her I love her brother, but I don\u2019t want him to live with us and our kids, if we choose to have them. Her parents are two wonderful people, and I feel they are much more equipped to take care of him like they have the last 21 years.  \n>  \n>My position is that he will be happier and better taken care of with his parents, and that it is their responsibility to do so. As far as I\u2019m aware they\u2019re planning on doing this anyway,  \n\n\nI can see your point of view, especially for those early years when the kids are young and you're establishing your careers and household routines. I suspect it will be more difficult to have your wife's brother in the home than she realizes and if her parents are able and willing to provide a stable and supportive living environment for him, that may be best.\n\nThat said, her parents are older and they will most likely die or be rendered incapable as caregivers by age-related conditions before her **younger** brother faces any such issues. Given this, I have to admit that I am honestly kind of bemused by your assertion that you love her brother and I can see why your fiance keeps breaking down in tears at this conversation. It must feel extremely frustrating and heartbreaking to be trying to discuss a life-long issue, and you dismissing it with a short-term (essentially) solution that doesn't appear to account for the long-term care complexities. You don't sound open to the brother living with you in the near-term or long-term, since your only solution is to send him to the parents. Well, what if something happens to her parents? What if they get Alzheimer's or are otherwise incapacitated by age-related conditions to the point they can no longer support him? What is your solution then?\n\nIt sounds like you two have different, and perhaps incompatible, value systems in relationships.  She seems to feel a stronger sense of familial affection and desire to cultivate and maintain close multi-generational and extended family care bonds even as an adult, where she and her family can continue to rely on each other as a familial care support system as she moves into the next phase of her life as a wife and mother. I'm guessing she draws on the communal support systems of a close-knit family.\n\nYou sound a bit as though feel the nuclear family should be prioritized as **the** family unit, and the multi-generational and extended family care bonds of the family(s) of origin should be attenuated, de-prioritized, and preferably compartmentalized into occasional set holiday visits. I'm guessing your family of origin interacts differently than hers does, and you prefer/ envision different family boundaries for your marital family home.\n\nIf she's happy with her current family boundaries, she may not be sharing your vision of family boundaries for your marital family home, and that's what this discussion is actually about.",
            "The thing is, your fiance's parents can't always take care of him. Also, it sounds like she wants to. You are not going to change her mind. Nor should you.  You need to decide whether or not this is something you're willing to work with.",
            "Here's the flat truth: she and her brother are a package deal.  He IS going to live with her.  You may not have much of a say about that.\n\nI saw your response to someone else where you say you'd be up for that later on in life.  But if this is very important to her you will probably not have much choice as to when it happens.  Then if you say no you're the bad guy.  The relationship ends either way, gradually or quickly.\n\nSome people downplay what is deeply important to them because they don't want to lose their partner.  But IMO it always resurfaces later and when you may not be prepared to deal with it because the other person has been quiet about it for a while.\n\nSo if I were you and I was strongly against living with her brother I would not marry her or tie my life to hers with children.  It will be much harder to opt out at that point.",
            "If you don\u2019t want to be a caretaker for her brother you need to break up with her. She\u2019s not going to let him end up in the states custody so if this is a dealbreaker for you it\u2019s time to walk away.",
            "Unfortunately, and fortunately, there's no right answer here. There's only the decision that you can live with. I don't envy the choice you have to make.",
            "\u201cYou\u2019ll barely know he\u2019s there\u201d \n\nWtf he\u2019s not a goldfish. He\u2019s a child. If anyone is raising him by barely knowing he\u2019s there, it\u2019s a problem.",
            "i know I'm late but maybe discuss alternatives? \n\nhe can attend a center for people with special needs so you won't have to constantly supervise him, or you can have a person to help you with him (professional assistant) .\n\nThe problem is and will be forever that he cannot take care of his own needs, shop for his own needs,plan ahead or even survive a day without someone telling him what to do ( eat,drink more water, wash yourself,stop eating) etc.\n\nYou will have to constantly think about him, manage finances for him too and there will constantly be the need of someone being home with him as much as possible and that means a lot of missed opportunities.\n\nAs you said,I'm sure he is a sweet person,maybe in time he will gain more independence but as of right now,you and your SO need to seriously analyse the problem.if left unsolved and he does come and live with you, he may pick up the tension between you two or even resentment and it will have a terrible impact on him, as they usually can't manage emotional pressure. Also, if you happen to stick around and then decide to leave/ send him back to his parents- it will again have a negative impact.\n\nso,it's is also in his best interest that you figure this out ahead of time.You should also be sure that you are capable of taking care of him! It's more complicated and complex than taking care of a young child, for example.\n\n If you want feel free to leave a message/comment and I can look for more resources for people with disabilities in your area, maybe some professional who can give you their opinion and some advices ? \n\n\n\nP.S.:you're doing great op, you'll figure this out!"

They were there for about 4 or 5 months, while my brother finished high school and during the summer I got to help them move into a place rented out by an old friend of my mom's for a lot cheaper than what the rent usually is for the area. But he started to get weird and moved friend into the backyard (he lived on the property as well) and then decided to rent the place out to someone else after my mom was living there for about 3 months. Finally my mom found out a family member had a duplex for rent and she's moved in there.\n\nAll while this was happening my grandfather decided that being a jerk to my mom would somehow help her? He was unsupportive of my mom from the start and blamed her for getting kicked out. He tried to get us to move into his and my grandmother's place for a few months but as soon as we started moving stuff in he would make snide comments about how he didn't expect us to move stuff in (which is a lie, him and my grandma talked about it multiple times), and was just a jerk the entire time. So that's when my mom asked her old friend for help instead of moving in with her parents. Ever since, my mom has tried to contact him by wishing him happy birthdays, etc and he won't respond. It has gotten so bad that I finally snapped last month and laid into him, now he won't respond to me and says my mom has brainwashed us. So Thanksgiving should be interesting this year haha.\n\nI haven't heard from my mom's ex boyfriend and don't care to. We heard he is seeing someone else and has been for a few months but will try to still text or call my mom. My mom is cordial with him since she still cares about him but she is enjoying focusing on herself and getting to explore what she likes to do again.\n\nMy mom is doing well. She has had some crazy stuff besides getting kicked out happen to her. She had a sort of skin cancer (not dangerous but still scared us until we knew what it was), her friend died, our cat that we have had for 17 years died, and now she has to have back surgery. But with finally being in a place where she can stay for as long as she wants, she's excited. She has been talking about starting online school after her back surgery and my brother is staying with her for awhile so they can both save up.\n\nAs for myself, it's been rough but I realized I needed to seek some help feeling so overwhelmed. So I'm seeing a therapist and making sure to take care of myself while still being there for my family. My original post was a lot of me freaking out but everyone is doing well despite all the bad circumstances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you to all the people who commented or offered advice. I appreciate it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Mom and brother bounced around a little but have finally found a place they can afford and stay for as long as they want. Mom has had some health issues but now that she's found a place she's getting those taken care of and is working on doing things she's wanted to do for awhile (schooling, new job, and dating again). Grandfather is jerk to his own family and has tried to be even more of a jerk while his family is struggling. But we are all doing well and trying to destress after all of this lol",

I guess he wanted to feel good about himself and impress me and the ex-wife without actually being out anything.  His behavior was probably the biggest instigator of fights between me and the ex.  I would have been happy to not count on anything from him and the ex was adamant about him following through with promises.",
            "So sorry it\u2019s been a rough few months for you guys. \n\nYour mom is lucky to have such a caring daughter like you. Make sure to call her once a day (or whenever you\u2019re able to), even if it\u2019s just to see what she\u2019s been up to or how she\u2019s feeling. Just being there and listening/having conversations can be mean a lot to someone, especially if they\u2019re lonely. Your mom is young and capable of many things, she just needs support.\n\nself care is super important for everyone. Nothing wrong with seeking therapy for some venting and help unravel your feelings of being overwhelmed. \n\nWish you and your family nothing but the best",

            "Her ex-boyfriend\u2019s behavior hurt her *emotionally*. Because it seemed so cruel. \n\nThe greatest gift you can give her is just to love her unconditionally. And remind her that she IS VERY lovable and she IS loved VERY much. \n\nAnd I mean HUG her, CALL her, make her a pie. Everyone is completely different and you know her 100,000 times better than I do so whatever you know will make her smile the most and make her feel loved, simple things that are practically free, DO them, regularly. Posting here on Reddit in itself shows how much you care about her. \n\nHug her. \n\nOnce she has that solid foundation, she\u2019ll have the strength to solve 99% of all the other financial problems herself.

        "selftext": "Hi all! I wanted to thank you for all of your responses on my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ep3scw/my_22f_boyfriend_32m_has_trouble_controlling_his/). I got so much support and I feel that it's appropriate to do an update.\n\nPosting anonymously on this subreddit was a huge step for me. So many people were blunt and honest about the reality of the situation based on what I posted. I have felt hurt for so long, and it felt great to get some feedback and support.\n\nAfter I posted here, I soon told my therapist and even read most of your responses out loud to her. It was eye opening to me, and she agreed that I'm in an abusive situation and it's not my job to wait around for this person to change. She also recognized the gaslighting and manipulation that was involved which was hard for me to accept at first. When I talked to my boyfriend about my concerns things got pretty ugly. He didn't respond to it well, and we talked back and forth for about a week over text and phone. At times he was apologetic, at other times he minimized my feelings even more and tried to justify his behavior. (At one point he said it was \"ignorant and selfish\" of me to criticize his \"mental health issues\"...okay?) Guilting, manipulation, even gaslighting. I couldn't take it anymore. Oh yeah, and when I stood my ground and repeated the statement \"I felt intimidated and afraid when you blared on the horn, threw the change, and yelled at me,\" he had the nerve to say (this is all over text mind you, and my friends/therapist agreed I was communicating very reasonably) \"I feel scared and intimidated by you right now, this whole convo is triggering\" lmfao??? Are you for real?\n\nThroughout all of the back and forth since the initial incident happened (the rage fit) I finally opened up to my close friends and all of them were hugely supportive of me and attentive to listen. They didn't know the extent of his rage and agreed that this was unhealthy. It felt really good to open up to them, for so long I wanted to defend this person's behavior.\n\nI broke up with him last night. My friends and even my dad agreed that I don't owe it to this person to break up in person, so I did it through text, exchanged goodbyes, and blocked him on every platform. I'm excited to move on in my life and focus on my schooling, friends, and just myself in general.\n\nThank you all again for the support and feedback, I needed it. I feel like my life has been changed for the better and the responses I got were huge for me to take that step. \n\n\\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* Listened to y'alls advice, dumped his ass, and I'm moving on. Thank you again!! <3",

            "Good for you OP, there's a line between supporting and understanding someone's mental health issues and letting them use those issues to excuse their abusive behaviors. And he was definitely doing that. \n\nPeople need support to change but without the will and work by that person, no amount of outside support will help that person improve. You did the right thing by demanding more",

With abusive people they expect you to take their shit indefinitely.  They can\u2019t handle feeling bad at all so they can\u2019t and won\u2019t take any responsibility.  Congrats on being brave enough to leave.",

            "Happy you took your life back like this! Don't let him get in your head too much. Of course he tried to victimize himself. Abusers aren't all self-aware, I'm sure his brain tried to justify his abuse to better cope with what he was doing. Take this time to heal and get to know yourself as an individual rather than a half of a relationship, with time I'm sure you'll find someone who loves and respects you with no conditions or toxicity.",

            "Was also in an abusive relationship. There has been more than a year since I broke up with her but every time I imagine having a relationship with another person I get anxious of the possibility of them treating me the same.

As other comments have posted out, you need to find the line between mental health and abuse, and he definitely was on the abusive side. Just know that despite being relieved, it\u2019s okay to feel sad about breaking up sometimes, I\u2019m sure you had a few good times with him and it\u2019s okay to feel sad. Congratulations with taking this step though- it\u2019s a big one!!",

            "This is a wonderful update, OP. \n\nLike many pointed out in the original thread, when you two first started dating, you were 19.5 years old...a teenager, technically, and for all intents and purposes. You have experienced so much growth, maturation, life, etc...and will absolutely continue to do so for the next decade or so. \n\nI\u2019m typically not a huge fan of the \u201cbloody hell, dump his arse\u201d reaction that\u2019s quite common \u2018round these parts, but this guy will only get worse; especially if he continues to refuse help. \n\nI do have to wonder though, if this guy is using his alleged mental illnesses as a scapegoat for him just being a royal douchebag.",
            "You'll find someone and \"when you know, you know\", just be patient, don't force a relationship of convenience. \n\nBe open, vulnerable, and communicate clearly with your future partner. Make sure you two love and trust, respect and admire each other. If either of you are afraid of being vulnerable and honest then you will not have an ideal relationship. It takes nurturing and exposing yourselves to each other in ways that allow you to love your true selves and accept yourselves for who you are instead of pretending or trying to impress and burning out.\n\nWhen you find that person who makes you feel giddy from the first moment, that's when you'll know you found the right one. Don't waste your time with anyone less.",

            "I just turned 25 this week and wow have I learned a lot in my twenties!\n\nI used to say that age didn't matter so long as we were both adults(ie no minors). Cue lots of men 30+ later,I came to realize that it does. \n\nI'm pretty average looking and a bit chubby so I thought I was safe from men who only wanted a younger woman. Boy,was I wrong! Every single person I dated or was FWB with(above 30)was an abuser. I've slept with at least 100 people since I was 18 and only two were near my age(one is my current fiance). \n\nYou need to be wary of someone 10 years older than you who is interested. If they're not in the same decade as you then give them a hard pass for now. \n\nPeople still view us as young,naive \"supple\" sex toys and want a taste. It's pretty sickening, honestly. I had so much bad luck with people but I didn't realize it was my own errors until stepping back. Sure,they shouldn't have been awful people but I also trusted way more than I should have(and thought I was being careful at the same time).\n\nTl;dr **DON'T DATE OUT OF YOUR DECADE**",

            "One of my favorite sayings is \"Don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.\"\n\nIf someone else 'needs' to do things that scare or hurt you, and refuses to have a conversation about it, they don't value you. Value your own safety and peace of mind and keep away from people like that.",

I have been there,  when their anger is a secret that only you and they know - like a parent who sexually abuses their child and swears them to secrecy. \n\nAbusers of all shapes and sizes all sing from the same sheet.\n\nWarning: It is not as easy to leave as you think . He will likely convince you he has changed. \n\nHe may even go see a therapist. \n\nBut change is not easy, even if we want to - as dieters all know. \n\nNow you have gotten out, stay out. \n\nYours, a fellow survivor of an angry abuser.",

            "How does the weight (of his baggage) off your shoulders feel? Sounds like undiagnosed bipolar or narcissism at the least he has some sociopathy going on. There\u2019s also a reason why there\u2019s such a difference in age. It demonstrates his maturity and likelihood that this isn\u2019t his first rodeo and the women close to his age won\u2019t tolerate what you have thus far bc he can\u2019t manipulate them like he was able with you and that\u2019s not your fault. Believe it or not it\u2019s good you went through this at 22 years old bc there are many out there. Now you will know the warning signs to get out sooner. It also taught you a lot. At some point in your life (older) you\u2019re unwilling to put up with the same shit when you\u2019re younger. Happy to hear you\u2019re free. Remember you don\u2019t owe anyone anything in life,  You only owe yourself respect, dignity and happiness bc you deserve it.",
