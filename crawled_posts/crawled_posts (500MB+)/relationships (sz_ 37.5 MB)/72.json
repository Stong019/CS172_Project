I didn't plan on it happening so soon, but we got into another petty fight and it escalated to the point where I told him this wasn't working. \n\nThe petty fight was because I refused to sleep on the side of the bed away from the phone charger. In my own apartment. One time I accidentally snoozed his alarm for work and he was late. I hadn't done it again since then but he held it over my head. I'm not sure what shifted the argument but it started to be about how he works harder than me and that I don't deserve my job because it's easier than his. It then turns back to all the grudges he's held against me, as it usually does. \n\nAfter fighting for almost 4 hours, I tell him that we need to take a break. He changes his demeanor completely and then tries to tell me that he's sorry and he doesn't want to lose me. He makes promises to curb his anger issues by taking medication and going to therapy, which I've asked of him time and time again to do in the past. I wonder at this point, why does it take me breaking up with him for him to finally want to do these things?\n\nThe next day I told him that he needed to pack his things from my apartment. I left for work and he did what I asked. A couple days later I went to get my keys. He started crying and telling me that this feels like a real break up. I told him it just might be, I didn't know if I wanted to get back together with him. I still feel regretful for saying it was a break, because I gave him hope that we would possibly reconcile when I didn't intend on it. I was afraid that if I had suggested a break up right off the bat I would have gotten a more explosive reaction from him. We hugged after I got my keys and I was hoping that maybe there was a chance we could remain friends.\n\nAbout two weeks after this he showed up at my apartment unannounced. I got scared and called my mom, and she hurried over. As soon as he saw her he told her that he just wanted his things. I should have seen this was a red flag because the only thing of his that remained was a hairdryer. As soon as I let them in he rushed over to my box of condoms and counted them, before saying there was one missing and running over to dig through my trashcans. He couldn't find anything and then tried to take the snake he got me for our anniversary. I stopped him from taking the snake, at this point I was sobbing and freaking out. My mom and I were yelling at him to leave or else we would call the police. After he left, I blocked him on all social media and his phone number. \n\nSince then I've had a mixed range of emotions, from missing him to hating him. I realize that he was abusive but I can't help but feel guilty about how things ended. I don't regret that I made the decision to break up with him, however, because a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders. I really want to thank everyone that replied to my post because you all gave me the courage to stand up for myself and initiate the end of this relationship that was slowly destroying me. I feel so free now that I have control of my life without someone micromanaging me, and I still struggle with thoughts of him but I'm slowly but surely improving. \n\nTl;dr: I broke up with my boyfriend, had some shit happen, but I'm much happier!\n\nEdit: to clear some confusion, this happened 4 months ago, almost 5. I haven't had any contact with him since I blocked him, and I dont have any worries about it since he probably hates my guts. Thank you all for the nice comments!",

            "You were right to call your mother. You should double check that your home can't be broken in to. He's not stable.",
            "Don't feel bad for initially calling it a break and not a breakup. I think you knew he was volatile and likely would have reacted violently. You needed to do what you needed to do to get him out of your house. \n\nIf he shows up again, don't open the door. Just call the cops.",
            "So glad you got out! Don\u2019t forget to change the locks just in case",
            "Well done OP, that sounds like a horrible experience but I hope you're giving yourself credit for just how strong you were in ending it. Congrats on your freedom!!",
            "You made a great decision! And it was very smart in not bringing up the break up right away. \nI don\u2019t wanna make you paranoid but I wouldn\u2019t feel good with the possibility of him showing up unannounced again. \nIf you don\u2019t feel safe alone, get a friend to sleep over at your place or go to your mom\u2019s for a bit.",
            "You shouldn\u2019t feel bad hon. He made it abundantly clear what his priorities were when he made a bee line for the condoms and made a huge deal about them. It\u2019s all about control, ownership, and paranoia. I\u2019m so glad to hear you have cut yourself off from him, you\u2019ll be stronger in the long run for it.",
            "It's been said before in the comments, but you absolutely must take distance from this man. You need to plan the escape wisely:\n- Don't let him contact you, don't ever let him back into your home. \n- Absolutely, DON'T REPLY TO HIS MESSAGES OR CALLS. Every time you reply to his calls, he will see that as an indication to continue bothering you. (And in his twisted mind he will think you care).\n- Take out a restraining order. Yes, you have to.\n- You did the right thing, it's essential that you cut him out of your life.\n\nThis is not a joke, it's a very serious matter. I have worked with victims of domestic abuse and violence (which you are) and this is a textbook example of how it starts. He makes you feel guilty for taking action on his bad behaviour. It's the purest form of gaslighting.\n\nPlease take this time to go to therapy to understand yourself and the situation you were just in. It will take some time to heal, but you will.\n\nAt this moment, great that you changed your number and blocked him from all social media. You might also have to change house, but first see how that restraining order will turn out. Do change the locks as soon as possible. \n\nTell all your family and friends not to give out any information about yourself to him. You haven't seen his worst sides yet, and trust me you don't want to.\n\nGreat that you're in a better place, trust me, you will find a great man one day who treats you like an equal. It starts with you knowing your value, and you are worth a lot.\n\nAll the best.",

            "Well that whole thing just took me back to my last relationship. Only difference is he didn't take the hint to leave, he ended up hurting me and we ended up in court. \n\nI am so glad you're out and not physically hurt. You can work through the mental stuff, I promise. See a psychologist. It will be the best thing for you. \n\nI was physically injured and will deal with that for the rest of my life. A constant reminder of the person he really was. It's terrifying how much worse it could have been. But it wasn't, I'm safe. And you are too, thank God.",
            "Do change the locks, the guy cant take no for an answer, you need to be feeling safe in your own space. Have you thought about getting a dog? It soothes the heart, and you will feel safer knowing you are not alone.",

Build strong friendships with people who have good values. Develop your creative interests.  Learn a new skill that makes you feel even more confident that you are a catch and not a damaged girl on the scrap heap of love. You are educated and renewed by the things you go through in life if you choose to learn from them and are not brought low by them.",
            "Sounds awfully close to my ex-girlfriend, which turned out to be a complete nut job. Every argument was always over something petty and assinine and rarely over anything that was important. After thinking I'd gotten rid of her, she gotten into my house while I was at work, poured water into my gaming PC that I'd recently built, my PS4 and took things that didn't even belong to her. I even had to block her on Facebook, Messenger and get my cell number changed. For the damage she did to my property, I had her ass locked up and currently going after her for damages. Good luck",

It's really not too expensive and it's basically a must in situations like this.\n\n2) Were you able to actually clarify with him that it's not a break and it's a permanent breakup? If you get the opportunity to see him again (aka he randomly appears or reaches out to you via an unblocked way) then I would clarify that with him. I feel like the uncertainty of a \"break\" can confuse a lot of crazy guys and they just keep being a bother until you are clear that no, it's 100% over.",

            "I feel for you, this is something that I keep telling myself because of the way I have ended my friendship, I was scared just like you from their reaction, don't feel guilty about it, and every time you miss him, remember that you did it because you stopped feeling safe with him, you did the right choice here, don't be sad we tend to give a lot of chances to the people we loved and thought that they loved us back the same. \n\nYou're better off without him, stay safe, I wish you the best :)",

            "Congratulations!! This took a lot of courage. Do not doubt this is the right decision. The range of emotions you\u2019re feeling, the guilt, the hate, missing him even, are all normal. Don\u2019t beat yourself up about them, give yourself time to process it all. Good luck! And to a new beginning!",
            "Next steps if he persists (or possibly, even if he doesn't) would be to tell your neighbors and landlord about the breakup and not to allow him into the building; to send him a strongly worded stay-away letter; and if necessary, to take out a restraining order. Good luck.",
            "I like your mother, she sounds great!\n\nAlso don't feel guilty for how you broke up with him. You said yourself up there that you did it the way you did for your own personal safety. I would've likely done the same in that position if I were alone with him.",
            "Please don't feel bad about tricking your abuser by calling it a \"break\" when you fully intended for it to be a \" break-up.\" Trying to leave a controlling, angry, abusive person is the most dangerous time - you followed your gut and kept yourself safe. Good for you!\n\nI made the mistake of letting my ex guilt me into returning to him after I'd managed to get away multiple times before I finally left got good. Each time, I'd do something to sweet-talk him out of continuing to bash my head into the stairs or beat me in some other fashion, then lie about where I was going and slip out with the intention of just not returning. He'd apologize and cry and insist that I'd promised to stay with him, and how could I have lied, etc. He'd promise to finally actually try to be better. It was always, to him, my fault that he treated me badly. And he never, ever actually worked on improving. I'm lucky I got out alive.\n\nIn short: know that you were smart and strong to end things the way you did, not cruel or manipulative.",
            "> As soon as I let them in he rushed over to my box of condoms and counted them, before saying there was one missing and running over to dig through my trashcans.\n\nWow, you did the right thing. Keep this guy dropkicked the eff out of your life",
            "I've been with people like that. You try and try to reach solutions and middle grounds, but they refuse at every step or only kind of try before falling back into old habits. That is, until you even breathe that it might be or is over. Then suddenly they are willing to really try! Of course, it's just a desperate ploy to keep you around.\n\nYou 100% made the right decision! Please don't feel guilty at all for calling it a break first. Even if you hadn't feared a bad reaction from him, a \"break\" carries the implication that it could go either way to begin with. It is not a promise that you will get back with him after x-amount of time. Because you already had a fear of his possible reactions, you made a smart move to at first give a middle ground of a \"may be this, maybe that\" solution allowing you a bit of time to separate and go about a complete break up.\n\nAs others have said, please pleas PLEASE change your locks and consider moving! Let your apartment manger(s) and staff know about the situation and that unless you tell them different he is not welcomed there. If he does show up, call the police immediately. Do not even talk to him through the door except maybe to say only ONCE that if he doesn't leave you will call the cops or that you have already called the cops (of course staying on the phone with the 911 operator through it). That's the only thing you should (not need) to say to him, if anything at all. Make sure to let family and friends know the situation as well. Yes, even HIS family and friends, if you still have any contact with them.  \n\n\nEdit: Spelling/grammar",
            "Wow. What a loser he is. Good for you.",
            "Hi! \n\nFirst I want to say it takes a lot to get out of these types of situations. It's an extremely difficult thing and takes a lot os strength. \n\nSecondly, I agree with everyone please change your locks. And just double check your security like if windows are easily accessible and stuff. This might be extreme but it's better safe than sorry. People like him can be unpredictable. You dont hear from them for a long time and then suddenly they can pop back up. So please be careful. \n\nOverall congrats and be proud of yourself for recognizing and getting out of a toxic relationship. It's also normal to have moments you want him back. It's normal. I think of it as a grieve process. Because you are kinda grieving the few fun times you had but also grieving the idea of the relationship that you wanted but didnt actually have.",

            "Rekey the locks (cheaper than changing them completely) and pat yourself on the back for being incredible and strong. He is indeed an abuser and you got yourself out. You should be proud. You deserve better!",
            "He tried to count your condoms \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02? You're better off without him",
            "Wow, bullet dodged indeed. Good on you OP for finally walking away. That reaction of his two weeks later, coming to your house was scary insane. How he had to convince himself you must surely be sleeping with someone else, because it couldn't possibly be his own anger and control issues that drove you away.\n\nSMH. This guy is so going to use the excuse \"I was cheated on by my ex and that's the way I am the way I am, please feel sorry for me and put up with my anger issues because I can't help it,\" to the next woman unfortunate enough to date him. \n\nThank god that's not your problem anymore.

            "This sounds almost exactly like how my relationship ended, was too scared to brake up so called it a break and then felt guilty for leading him on. But really, he should feel guilty for making you scared to communicate with him in the first place. You will not regret this decision, I promise. I remember feeling the weight off my shoulders and the relief it gave me. I finally stopped waking up crying for no reason after that. Your mental health will thank you!",
            "I'm really glad that you're out of this. You should take extra precautions that people are suggesting. But:\n\n> I was hoping that maybe there was a chance we could remain friends.\n\nI think it would be wise for you to rethink what is and isn't acceptable to you in a relationship. This isn't a person you should be friends with, let alone dating. You need to work on your personal boundaries to ensure that something like this doesn't happen again. Therapy and counseling would be good options for this.",

It's a big change, and there were lots of emotions attached to him and the relationship as a whole!

        "selftext": "[Here is the original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4gklvc/my_23f_exs_25m_mom_40sf_shared_a_on_this_day/)\n\nI posted on Reddit a couple of days after I received the message from Krystal. After reading your comments, I agreed that I did not owe Krystal any response or action but I did think that sending a screenshot to Ross would be the best idea. If he had a problem with me being friends with him/keeping in touch with his family on social media, I would have no problem deleting them. To me, that should come from him, not her.\n\nSo later that night, I sent Ross a screenshot of the message Krystal sent me and I added:\n\n\"Hey Ross. I received this message from Krystal a few days ago. Not sure what this is about, but if you have any issues with me being friends with you and/or your family on Facebook, just let me know and I will respect that. Thanks!\"\n\nI saw that he read the message a couple of hours later. He didn't respond that night but I got a message from him late the next morning. He said:\n\n\"throwxyz22, thanks for sending me that screenshot. I had no idea that Krystal messaged you and I want to apologize for her behavior. She was completely out of line in sending you that.\n\nI spoke with her yesterday after I saw your message and she got pretty defensive. She told me that she saw that my mom still has pictures of you in one of our photo albums and when she saw that my mom shared that memory of us on vacation, she got really insecure and took it out on you. She has never come to me and talked about it but I told her that there is nothing to worry about and both you and I have moved on. This upset her even more and she accused me of cheating and said she found a sex tape of us on my laptop and threatened to show it to my mom. At this point I just told her we're over. I think that yous should just block her on Facebook because she will probably try to take it out on you. You didn't do anything wrong. Sorry for bringing you into this mess lol but thank you for giving me the heads up... I dodged a bullet there.\"\n\nSo... that escalated quickly.\n\nFor the record, Ross and I never made a sex tape. Any NSFW ones that we did make were deleted immediately after watching. I called him to firm that up and he assured me she didn't find anything, she was just using it as ammunition to try to get him to admit that he either 1. Had a NSFW video with me or 2. Was cheating on her with me.\n\nNot really much to say other than that! I've blocked her on all social media and haven't heard anything since. I hope she doesn't have my phone number, haha.\n\nSituations like these make me happy that I have chosen to stay single for a little while. Thanks for all of your advice Reddit :) It really helped!\n\nTL;DR: I told Ross about Krystal. She accused him of cheating and threatened him, so he broke up with her. I've blocked her on all social media now.",

The only advice I have for you is to be very careful with your social media accounts right now. Hopefully Krystal doesn't know your phone number, but someone who's unfortunately this insecure won't be above making fake profiles follow you or friend you or having friends do it. ",

You just KNOW Krystal is going to take it out on OP; with people like this, it's always someone else's fault. As much as I'd love to see OP tell her, \"You brought this on yourself,\" you just can't reason with crazy. Keep your accounts locked down, OP!",
            "It's so refreshing when exes are nice to each other. Ross sounds like a terrific guy, I hope someday you two can be friends again. It sounds like he has a lot of respect for you. And you handled this situation with class, grace, and maturity. Way to adult!",
            "I like happy endings! /Happy for everyone but Krystal of course. \n\n\nNicely handled OP. ",
            "Somewhat similar situation happened to me but it was my ex that sent me a vitriolic email saying I needed to \"get over her\" and stop contacting her family (which I wasn't beyond being FB friends & liking each other's posts on occasion).

            "All the shipping for Ross and /u/throwxyz22 almost would make one think Krystal had a point... They broke up, people! They're both mature adults, yes, they communicate well when needed, indeed, but adults who can break up in a mature way aren't destined to be with each other again. They presumably also broke up for good reasons.",

            "Thanks for updating! I really wanted to see how this situation turned out. It sounds like everything went about as well as it could have. And good job not going with any of the drama-baiting maneuvers so rampantly upvoted in the original question. You handled this like an adult without stooping to Krystal's level.",
            "Ohhh women with names that have 'K' in place of the rightful 'C'. \n\nThey never cease to disappoint. ",
            "I hope Krystal learned a very valuable lesson about communication that night. All it took was a post Ross's *mother* made, and she escalated a non issue into empty blackmail out of her own insecurity and all it did was get her dumped.\n\nYou did Ross a huge favor.",
            "Hey, much respect to both you and Ross for handling the situation in such a calm and respectful way. It sounds like Ross really values your feelings and it's good that you guys have a respectful relationship.\nHappy for you OP!",
            "I really want this stickied so people dealing with ex stuff can see how two people can still be perfectly adult and courteous with each other even after a relationship ends. Well done on both your parts.",

            "You can't help but laugh at the stupidity of Krystal.  She took a benign photograph out of context, and it cost her her entire relationship.\n\nOne day...she'll look back at this and hopefully she'll realize how much of a dumbfuck she was being.  Sadly though, some people are just dumbfucks for their entire lifetime",

You could have ignored it all together too. \n\nBottom line, it's a waste of time to win when the opponent is crazy. You could have treated her like a patient who has no logic. Also I usually just treat exes like strangers. And getting Ross involved made it seem like you needed his approval. Unless you and Ross are still tight, there is no point to contact him. \n\nContacting Ross to me = telling him \"your dog bit me so go deal with your dog and admit you have a crazy dog\"( and prove to him by showing him your wound). \n\nInstead you could have just patted the dog a bit and showed the dog where the home is, if the bite didn't bother you too much. \n\n",

            "OP,\n\nI just saw your post now. What I would have done differently was to reply to Krystal and tell her it is between her and Ross now and you wish to have nothing to do with it. Refer her back to Ross if it's pertaining any relationship issue as they should be the parties involved, not you. Sincerely wish her well and politely state that you will no longer respond to any of her further message as it doesn't pertain you. \n\nI wouldn't however contact Ross, as it looks like you are going behind Krystal's back. I agree Krystal might be a bitch or doesn't deserve the respect. But you as a nice person could show her how to be graceful. Whether or not you getting Ross's approval is irrelevant in this case.\n\nI would have been angry seeing what Krystal wrote, however having some compassion for another person even if it's someone you don't like separates you from the ordinary people out there. She might be going through a lot of emotional turmoil and the idea of you definitely makes her uncomfortable. It's not your responsibility to take care of her emotions, yet you could also be sensitive that your actions do have impact on her. You and I both have had moments of insecurities in the past I am sure, and the last thing we want from it is to get stuck in an endless fighting mode, having it snowballed into something bigger and bigger. If the girl who i am jealous of could teach me a lesson with kindness, I would appreciate it. \n\n\nThat's just me. \n\n\n",

I read every comment, though I didn't have the time to respond individually. Here's the update.\n\nAbout an hour after I posted on this sub asking for advice, I did the following 3 things:\n\n1. Sent an email to the entire group, basically saying, \"Hey, this is what I've found, I don't want to accuse anyone of intentional plagiarism, but the school is certainly going to interpret it as such. I need EVERYONE to double-check their sections and confirm to me that they either have no issues with their citations, or that they are working to fix their citations.\"\n\n2. Reached out to the professor requesting an urgent phone call.\n\n3. Spent the entire night looking through the entire paper. And guess what I found. Yep, *another person in our group did the same thing with her section.* It was actually even worse than what Guy #1 did, because she would copy/paste information from the same source for 3 or 4 sentences in a row, and then she would only add the footnote at the end of the very last sentence in the paragraph.\n\nThe next morning (Monday), 2 things happened:\n\n1. Only one person in the group (the 4th person) replied to my email. He confirmed that he did not have any issues with citation in his parts, and volunteered to help me look through the entire paper and check citations against original sources.\n\n2. Our advisor and I had a phone conversation. She was surprisingly accommodating about the whole thing. She said that since I was voluntarily bringing it to her attention before the paper was due, she would be willing to give us some leeway. She gave us a 12-hour extension for submitting the paper, and she promised that after she runs the paper through a plagiarism detection software, if she does spot anything that is suspect of plagiarism, she would discuss it with our team FIRST before taking anything to the academic board or whatever it's called.\n\nGuy #4 and I spent all of Monday going through the paper again and pulling every single source that every single person had cited, looking at the exact page numbers in the PDFs and making sure that citations were done correctly. It was an absolutely exhausting, draining, miserable process. Guy #1 and Girl #2 were probably dead or something during this entire time, because we didn't hear a peep from them. We submitted the paper by the extended deadline, and I think we're good to go, even though I wish Guy #1 and Girl #2 had been penalized in some way because I worked so fucking hard to cover their asses.\n\nA couple of thoughts:\n\n1. Don't believe anyone who says group projects are a taste of the real world. They are not. I've been working professionally for the last 6 years, and I can tell you, I have never worked with a single person - even government employees - who has been as incompetent, lazy and just a plain dimwitted fucknut as the people I've encountered in grad school.\n\n2. We messed up long before this, by not finishing our paper sooner. Honestly, for me, I was the only person in the group with a full-time job outside of this full-time masters program, so I've been extremely busy, but I know it's not a good enough excuse for procrastinating. I guess I just never imagined that grad students would need someone to educate them about what constitutes plagiarism. \n\n3. Yes, pulling something directly from a source without using quotation marks, even if you have a footnote, is plagiarism -- our advisor confirmed.\n\n4. Don't do group projects! Period! I had the option to do a solo thesis and I chose to go the capstone group project route, because our program heavily discouraged the solo thesis option. Look where it got me!\n  \nThanks everyone. Lesson learned. Never talking to these fuckers again.\n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: We got an extension from our advisor to double-check and rework the thesis/capstone. We submitted it and now we should be good to go for graduation.\n",

            "Group projects, especially at higher levels of educations, are such a trap. Unless you know your partners very well (and sometimes even then), someone is inevitably bound to get fucked over. It's almost always more work to keep after other adults that it is to shoulder the entire burden of an assignment alone. Personally, I think anything more than pair projects are just doomed from the start. \n\nIf you have an original version of your thesis, I would strongly reccommend submitting that to your instructor along with the note that only Guy #4 responded to help with what turned out to be a very extensive correction process. Explain that while you understand mistakes happen, even at this level of education, you feel it is your due diligence to note that your other 2 partners were neither willing to acknowledge those/their mistakes nor willing play a part on fixing them. Your instructor should see what youre getting at without it sounding too much like tattling. \n\nIf you're unconcerned about ratting out the cheaters in your group, talk to guy #4 about submitting more detailed evidence of your 2 group members cheating. Personally, I HATE cheating so its probably what I would do. If guy#4 is on board, submit (preferably in person but could be via email) your evidence of the original version of the thesis seperated by contributor with plagarized sections highlighted. Explain that it wouldn't bother you quite so much if the individuals who had improperly cited their sources had come together and fixed it but that you find it both unfair and quite distrubing that the people in your group responsible for the mistakes in the original version went radio silent when you attempted to address them. Shit happens. But being a professional means taking care of it- not burying your head in the sand. \n\nNo matter what, THANK YOUR INSTRUCTOR for giving you additional time and let them know that whatever they decide, you understand that whats done about this whole debacle from here is 100% their choice. This will let your instructor know you're not going to push the situation higher up the food chain, something that your instructor will want to do themself if they feel its needed. ",

Graduate students should have learned this stuff by graduate school, but here's what I think I would have done as your teacher:  Call a special session for those who needed last-minute help cleaning up their attributions.  Maybe hold a lab.  Maybe put each group's problem attributions on a projector and show the whole class how to do it correctly so they didn't get accused of plagiarism in another class.  \n\nWell-meaning people can mess this up.  Academics rarely mess it up, because so much is riding on the way they present previous research.  Trained journalists rarely mess it up, because they practice it every day.  But well-meaning students can mess it up without knowing the seriousness of messing it up, and without having meant to plagiarize.  I know they should know better, but I would treat this as an ignorant mistake rather than intentional plagiarism.  ",

You and group member #4 need to sit down and talk with your professor about this. These two group members very nearly royally SCREWED you two over and if you hadn't found this, you would be in an incredible amount of trouble. \n\nIf your advisor doesn't want to do anything about it, take these screenshots and the two copies  of the different papers to the academic honesty board. Don't let them skirt by on your hard work because they took the lazy way out. That is 100% what those two are doing considering they didn't answer your messages. \n\nI had this same issue with two of my group members in my practicum group research and my friend and I had to work our asses off at the end of the semester to fix what they'd done. We had kept the documents on a google doc, so their edit log really and truly saved our asses when we approached our professor after we noticed what they'd done. \n\nI'm happy that you got things fixed, but I seriously urge you to not let these two get away with nearly ruining your grade.

We were the couple everyone looked to.  We went everywhere together.  I was invited to all her family get togethers.  She was smart and very attracted to me.  She couldn't keep her hands off of me when we were together. We, I thought had a great relationship.  I worked some nights during the week but always asked off for a weekend night to take her out.  On the nights I was working she was hooking up with another guy.  He never took her out on dates.  He just went to her house to hook up.  She did this for a year before I found out.  I was the safe stable guy with a job while he was the guy who was getting her on the side.  He knew all about our relationship.  All of her family knew and never told me.  Even today 30 years later I sometimes think of her betrayal and how I looked like such a fool to so many people.  How I was used and taken advantage.  I have no good feelings for her but I am still bothered how she could use me so easily.  Now I wouldn't break down over it but I have talked about it over the years and used it as a teachable moment with my kids.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe probably has no feelings for her ex but the betrayal still hurts.

I know that 6 months is not comparable to 4 years, but time isn't linear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am looking forward to dating and loving someone new, and these memories do not mean I still have lingering feelings for my ex. The pain is no longer associated with him as a person, but rather the pain and shame of being broken up with in the first place, and knowing that my long term investment was for naught.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI suspect that these memories will always hurt, because it hurts to be hurt by another person and that's okay. I do not believe indifference is achievable for each and every person. My sister is currently engaged, and still gets angry when she thinks about her last breakup from 3 years ago. She is completely devoted to her fiance and also has no feelings for her ex.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy theory is that it is painful because the memory forces me to feel lesser than I view myself, and it feels as if my power is taken away. It also continually forces me to revisit the fact that I somehow got myself into that mess, that I was unable see the signs, which invokes feelings of disappointment in myself. That is where my pain comes from. I would not jump to the conclusion that your wife is not over her ex, instead talk to her about it more and try to see exactly where her pain comes from.",
            "Think about what happened at dinner from your wife\u2019s POV:\n\nShe\u2019s having a good dinner with her husband and her daughter. It\u2019s always great to sit down and spend time with her family at the end of the day, a special time to relax and bond. The two of you are drinking some wine, and the conversation has been relatively light, normal, and pleasant. Then *out of nowhere* her daughter asks \u201cHey why did you and EXBF break up?\u201d\n\nYour wife is **completely blindsided** by the question. She\u2019s flooded with memories and emotions from that time: the deep pain, rage, and betrayal of finding out that her EX was cheating; the devastation and embarrassment of her relationship ending as her EX leaves your wife for his mistress; the confusion and shame of \u201cHow do I explain this to other people? How do I explain this to my child?\u201d; the worry about how the sudden loss of an established parental figure is going to affect her daughter; and the fear and uncertainty as the path she thought her life was going on is suddenly yanked out from under her. \n\nHow does she even answer that question? What is she supposed to say to a twelve year old? Her mind is racing and she\u2019s starting to panic. She has no idea what to say, she wasn\u2019t expecting to talk to her daughter about this at this young age (especially not over family dinner), and the next thing she knows she\u2019s crying as all those emotions she never properly dealt with begin overwhelm her. She can\u2019t stand the thought of breaking down in front of her daughter so she gets up and leaves the room to try and compose herself. \n\n\u2014-\n\nThe most likely explanation here is that your wife got overwhelmed by an out of the blue question that bought up some painful memories she wasn\u2019t expecting nor was emotionally prepared for. It sounds like she still hasn\u2019t fully dealt with the emotional trauma of being broken up with in such a painful, embarrassing, confusing, and traumatic way. Maybe she repressed all those emotions and that question brought everything up all at once. Maybe she thought she *had* fully dealt with what happened and this instance is the wake up call she needs so she can readdress the trauma to actually heal. Whatever the reason for this emotional response she needs to consider talking to a professional to get help with processing and moving past this experience, because it sounds like she hasn\u2019t been able to do so on her own.

            "If I had some wine in me you could probably coax a few tears out of me about a couple of my ex's. It has no bearing on my current relationship, it's just feelings over how I was treated in the past. \n\nAnd as much as I dislike one of my ex's for how things went down near the end, there were still 8 years of time spent with that human and a lot of ups as well as the downs. I'll still always cherish the time spent with him and learning his ins and outs, but that absolutely does not mean I want him back or that I have stronger feelings for him than my current relationship. Even if he called me right now and begged me back I would not be tempted. Different person, different time, I'm happy with how my life is now. ",
            "I would take the 12 year old's comment with a grain of salt, honestly. There's no merit behind the \"I thought she was over that\" comment because there's no way that her child has a real grasp of what transpired (especially at 8 year old), and it's really not fair for your wife to be doubted by you -- especially if she's never given you reason to distrust her. It seems like your wife has a history of failed/bad relationships before you, and asking about her ex-boyfriend over dinner was inappropriate and probably caught her off-guard. \n\nBeing left for another person is a soul-crushing, trust-ruining situation, and if you haven't been in her shoes figuratively, then I don't think you have a real understanding of how difficult it probably is for her to fully trust again. Honestly, if her reaction was that intense, I would be much more concerned about her emotional well-being and suggest she seek some sort of counseling as soon as possible.\n\nHell, I know that if someone brings up my ex, it stirs me up emotionally -- and it has *nothing* to do with feelings other than disgust, heartbreak and anger. I think your wife needs a \"blank slate\" to speak to (a professional one, I mean!) because if the reaction is strong enough to break her down this way on a whim, then there's something she hasn't yet come to terms with. I don't think you're a good candidate for that sort of unbiased third-party view because you're already doubting yourself and projecting that doubt onto her (\"I'll never live up to them\", \"she has leftover feelings\", her daughter's remark, etc.\"). Also to clarify: counseling does not equal the demise of your marriage, and could bring you both closer together because you'll know what she needs from you in order to heal.\n\nPlease be a little more empathetic to her, as the marriage is still pretty new for you both and is an entirely new level of opening up and trusting someone else not to break her heart the same way. ",
            "I understand where you're coming from, OP.  I think it's important to remember that you can be completely over an ex, but still not over what they did to hurt you so deeply.\n\nI was with my ex for ten years.  He cheated on me three times in increasing severity.  I found out about the last one because his iPad was synced to his phone and, while he was at work (you know, the work where he told me it would be seen an unprofessional for him to take texts or calls from his wife), the iPad kept making noises in a drawer.\n\nI took it out to silence it and saw a bunch of texts from nurses he worked with (he was a surgeon) and another doctor (a woman).  They were incredibly flirtatious and sexual.  They were all ages from early 20's to mid-40's (we were in our mid-twenties).  \n\nOh, and this all happened on Christmas day, 2015.\n\nWe got divorced shortly after.  \n\nI don't miss him.  I rarely think about him unless its in context to a story being told or it's about something I did in the ten years that I was with him.  I'm not interested in anything he has done or will do in his life.  If you told me he got hit by a truck and died tomorrow, I wouldn't feel a damn thing except, \"Damn, that's a bad way to go.\"\n\nBut hell yes I get INCREDIBLY pissed at what he did.  The depths of his lies and his betrayal.  The way he gaslit and manipulated me ruthlessly while pretending he was too much of a bumblefuck to figure out even how to cheat, much less have time to do so.  I'm still bitter over the damage he dealt me in his breathless, headlong careening towards his own selfish rush of adrenaline to get his ego stroked.\n\nI'm pissed that I wasted ten years on him when I could have done ANYTHING (or anyone) else.  And, frankly, I'm incredibly mad still that I had to spend my own damn money on therapy getting over what HE did just so I could feel like I was someone worth loyalty and love.  That I wasn't a damn idiot for trusting a fool or explaining away the red flags.  I had to learn how to not be ashamed or taking responsibility for the bullshit that he decided to do.\n\nSo, I relate to your wife because I've been there.  I understand your concerns.  I just feel like you should sit down with her and explain that you understand she can feel shitty about herself because of what he did to her while still being over him as a person.  Because that's probably what it is.\n\nI guarantee she's mortified right now.  So she needs you to talk to her and listen to her while she explains what she was thinking and feeling.  If, by the end of it, you still feel like she's not over HIM (as opposed to not over how he treated her and made her feel about herself), then you need to ask her gently about that too.  Again, let her explain herself and just listen.  \n\nCommunication goes a long, long way especially with something like this.",
            "I can't speak for all women but feelings of betrayal do not disappear even with moving on and being in a relationship. Oftentimes, we have moments were we remember how deep we bled, how devastated we were. Those memories are only as strong as they once were if we don't heal from the trauma of our past. Your wife is suffering from living in the past. As hard as a honest conversation may be, it may be best for the both of you to discuss this. Both of your feelings matter here. She needs to live in the present and reflect on how her current relationship is making her feel as opposed to regurgitating the past. ",
            "Here\u2019s a thought: what if she blew up in anger instead of crying? Would you consider her not over him then? I understand where you\u2019re coming from OP. This really does seem like this is her hurt feelings and humiliation resurfacing rather than old romantic feelings. Feelings happen, we can\u2019t control them, but we can control how we respond to them. She got hit in a moment of weakness and got sad, she didn\u2019t pick up the phone and call him. Actions speak loudest and she married you.",
            "Pain and healing aren't linear. This is entirely believable as (and most likely is) unprocessed/unpackaged pain from the betrayal, which isn't equal to missing an ex. Someone very suddenly and unexpectedly asked her a very personal question about a very painful time in her life. Your stepdaughter probably never knew why they broke up. \n\nInstead of making this about you, try to see if she needs help unpacking her pain and her insecurities as a result of that experience.\n\n\"I\u2019ll never live up to what they had together.\" What they have is a broken and dead past relationship where he ends up leaving her for another woman... I hope you don't live up to what they had together.",

            ">Her daughter says \u2018thought she would have been over that by now\u2019 and I say the same.\n\nThis part is bugging me. You also said that she should be over it? No wonder she got defensive and upset. Both you and her daughter \"ganged up\" on her. Everyone here is saying that you need to console her and that your reaction is warranted, but I am not so sure.\n\nDo you know the full extent of the relationship trauma she endured with him? Like, what the \"betrayal\" was that led to the dissolution of their relationship, the reason he left her for someone else? Some things are easier to get over than others, and how long it takes for people to heal is different for each person. Has she given you any reason in the past year to doubt her love for you, or to make you think she still has feelings for him? I'm sorry, friend, but I think you are over-dramatizing this to your own benefit without considering the very real pain she felt and still feels to this day. Being cheated on and left for another man or woman can be deeply, deeply traumatizing.",

Fell asleep later than I did cuddled in my best friend\u2019s arms... literally 3 times on this one fucking trip.\n\nShe told me we needed to take a break (lasted indefinitely), which didn\u2019t make sense at the time. The same \u201cbest friend\u201d who lived in her house came over every day to check on me and tell me that she still loved me and blah blah blah. Struggled so hard for a whole year not knowing wtf was happening, \u201cbest friend\u201d and her had a blow up and he moved into my bedroom while I was gone for the summer. I return home from the summer and a month or two later the \u201cbest friend\u201d confronted me to say they had been together during those months directly after we took the break. Completely ruined me and what I thought I had as friends. I lost most of my friends during this time, because she and my \u201cbest friend\u201d were so involved with every other friend group I had there.\n\nReally fucked me up for a while. Even sitting here in my 4th year of an amazing relationship, 5 years after all this bullshit.... I\u2019m having a hard time typing this without getting so pissed. I don\u2019t have feelings for my ex, but oh man it hurts so bad to think about. I still have to see my ex best friend sometimes, and honestly no matter how hard I try to move on - it still just fucking destroys me. \n\nThat said, it helps to know that he\u2019s working a shitty job at a grocery store and I\u2019m working towards my dreams.",

I don\u2019t know that many people who literally burst into tears because they... are in love with their ex? That doesn\u2019t happen. But people cry because of loss, betrayal, grief, self-doubt, frustration, sadness... None of this means she\u2019s not \u201cover\u201d him.

I mean, shit I hadn't thought about in years (and, occasionally, actually worked through in therapy in my 20's so these are things I am long at peace with).  There is a quiet, still little voice in the middle of my brain saying, \"Seriously...WTF!\" but it doesn't stop it from happening.  At this stage of the game, I know to look at my period tracker and say, \"Yeah, fuck you, too, PMS,\" but your wife may not be at that stage of the game and not understand what's going on.  (It takes a lot of women by surprise...sure as hell did me.)  \n\nMenopause isn't just about the hot flashes in those last few years - there is a decade (or more, if you're really lucky (\u25d4\\_\u25d4) ) leading up to it where your hormones start to just wig the fuck out on you.  In her early 40's, your wife is in a prime time of her life to start getting these wicked, irrational mood swings.  As me and many of my contemporaries from high school and college will all attest to - we have all said at one point or another that we can't wait for menopause to actually get here because this shit is annoying.\n\nNow, is it touchy as hell to bring up a woman's hormones to her? YES.  I honestly don't know how you'd do it.  But if she is noticing her mood is swinging around irrationally and says something, that might be an entry to communication.  Otherwise, I would try not to take this so hard - a combination of a brutal betrayal and a hormone swing where someone brought it up? I could totally see her breaking down in tears.",

            "I\u2019ve been with my wife for six years, after a breakup ten years ago that was devastating to me. I thought I was good until I saw her in the grocery store with her husband and I had a full blown panic attack. It had been years of no contact with her.\n\nHad nothing to do with the fact that I\u2019m married to a wonderful woman. I just thought I was okay until I suddenly wasn\u2019t. ",

            "How long was she with the ex? How serious were they?\n\nAs others have pointed out, deep betrayal leaves pain for a while. My ex husband left me for a good friend two years ago and while I have absolutely no desire to get back with him and am happy in my current relationship, the pain from that betrayal still cuts really deep at unexpected times. Even fantasies of him coming to me apologizing and professing his guilt and love for me - but I don't want him back, I just want validation and closure, which I'm unlikely to ever get. This is all in a situation where he and I don't talk by my choice and he stated he wanted to have a friendship with me, so if I was really vying to try and get back in his life because of unresolved feelings, that would be very easy for me to do. But I genuinely don't want him in my life, so I don't. But it doesn't make that desire for vindication or some sort of Justice go away. Only time and a lot of mental work is going to do that.\n\nI was told with these kinds of divorces/break-up, it's expected to still be actively working through the pain of it on some level for roughly half the time of the relationship that was broken (and even then there will always be scars) - which is why I asked about the length of their relationship. Of course, therapy or avoidance can help or hinder that process, but it can be, reasonably, a long while.",
            "I have been in your wife\u2019s shoes and I can say that I feel exactly the same when I think about my ex that cheated on me. I get extremely upset, not because I have feelings for him, but because all of those feelings of hurt and humiliation re-emerge and my self esteem plummets. For some people, being cheated on creates a degree of trauma and changes your perception of yourself and other people. \n\nYou should take her at her word and see if there is anything you can do to help her though those feelings. ",

            "This isn't about you. And it isn't about your relationship. I'm married to the love of my life, who I've been with for 9 years, married for 5. It's my second marriage, and I still cry sometimes when I think about my first marriage and first husband. There will forever be a knot of emotion in my chest over that loss and trauma, no matter how happy I am with my current husband, no matter the fact that I wouldn't change anything about how things shook out. People and their emotions are complicated, yo. The best thing you can do is accept this and try as best you can to be understanding and empathetic. Remember, it's not about you or the life you've built together. It just isn't. ",
            "This is like if he broke her arm and now it aches sometimes. It\u2019s leftover pain from an injury. It doesn\u2019t mean she has feelings for him. Emotional trauma, like physical trauma, can take years to fade. ",
            "I have an ex who abused me. Took me years to leave because I was so brainwashed, but it\u2019s the best thing I ever did. However, I still have visceral reactions that I cannot control over two years later (and in a happy relationship).\n\nFor example, he has a common name that he also shares with a very famous person. When I hear his name, I still flinch and get a little sweaty. Certain situations will give me a panic attack because they\u2019re reminiscent of the manipulation, intimidation and gas-lighting I experienced. When someone brings him up (aka, I\u2019m not prepared to talked about him), I have to try very hard not to get upset. I\u2019ve been in therapy every since a year before I left him and I\u2019ve made huge progress, but I still have a ways to go. \n\nMy point is that some emotional pain can be so traumatic, it can cause a reaction much like your wife had, especially if the topic comes up in a way you weren\u2019t expecting or prepared for. She may have had a shit day or week and bringing up that painful time was just the cherry on top she didn\u2019t have the fortitude to withstand. \n\nI believe her when she says she\u2019s crying about the pain and not him. She is probably thinking about the weeks and months of agony, humiliation, confusion, depression, anxiety and all the rebuilding that came after it. It\u2019s a shitload of work. You do it once and you\u2019ll NEVER want to do it again, so being with you is also still kind of scary. All of this can come up in a tidal wave of emotions and make for some solid dinner theatre. \n\nGive her a break, talk to her about it when you feel the time is right and listen to her. But most importantly, believe her and support her. One of the cornerstones to healing is support, so if you give her that space to do it, she\u2019ll love you for it even more. Best of luck to you two. ",

It all happens in a micro second like the memory just triggers the release of all those chemicals in my brain. \n\nI'm now married and very happy in my marriage, I don't think my ex is a fraction of the person I married but I think of it the same way as PTSD (obviously nowhere near as extreme) in that in a moment you can be transported back to a version of yourself that was horrible to be. \n\nNormally I'm quite cynical about these things but this one I feel like I understand. If I were you I'd take the opportunity to be the man he never was and let her talk it out and feel safe and supported by you. \n\nIf you imagine she's been physically hurt, bringing up the incident could trigger a response that's about the injury and the struggle to recover rather than the person who hurt her. \n",

            "Being a parent, I can see this absolutely being about the betrayal. She introduced her young child to this man who was in her life for 5ish years (long time for a young kid) and then he turns around and leaves with a good friend (double whammy). I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she also harbors guilt over having her daughter a part of that ordeal. Then to have her ask, something she\u2019s probably been waiting for, just put her over the edge. That would be a difficult situation to come out of. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s grateful for it because you two are together now.

We\u2019re human and we can\u2019t forget significant things. It probably took her off guard when she was not expecting it, therefore open and vulnerable to it. Sounds as if it surprised her and brought up lots of horrid things for her. \n\nPlus if your wife is anything like me we can be emotional when it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a good reason, there\u2019s reason enough for us and that emotion in that moment is over bearing.

I was horrified and hurt by the suggestion, because the story was quite unpleasant and I\u2019d made it clear that I\u2019d put it all behind me.

I expected to cry or something, but it was the first time I\u2019ve heard something like that about him and just haven\u2019t cared. It\u2019s taken a lot to get to this point though. For the first two years after we ended things, I was a hot mess. I was hooking up with guys, married guys, guys old enough to be my dad, etc. I was drinking all the time. I barely passed some of my classes. Everyone recovers in their own way and their own pace. ",
            "I don't think you ever \"get over\" a betrayal like that. She might be over her feelings for *him* but that doesn't mean she's ever going to be fully over the betrayal.

This is a *hard* time of year that brings up a lot of emotions for people - a lot of feelings of loneliness and disappointment, even if they are happy and secure now. \n\nI don't think this has anything to do with her love or connection with you. This was a moment when she was caught off guard, possibly having a lot of holiday-related angst from decades of past holiday pain. And then that was brought up. It sounds like she was just caught off guard and didn't know how she was supposed to explain what happened to her child. \n\nJust love her and accept her and have empathy for her. Do you not have any subjects from your past that you still feel pain about if you're forced to think about them, and then to talk about them with people you hadn't anticipated discussing these things with? I bet you do. It's nothing to do with her feelings for you. ",

We were together 11 years when I found out he\u2019s a pedofile. In no way do I miss him, in fact, I loath him. But wedding stuff on tv brings back all those powerful emotions of how I trusted him 100% and then it all fell apart. It\u2019s more about suddenly having to be reminded of the awful feelings than missing him. ",
            "In my experience, you never really get over what somebody did when it hurt you that much.

Furthermore a lot of people feel really humiliated when a partner cheats on them or leaves them for someone else. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s abnormal that she is still upset about this even if she has no feelings for the ex anymore. \nMake it clear to her that you are there for her to talk about her feelings regarding the situation she went through with her ex, and keep an open mind that she can still be upset about this without wanting to get back together with her ex",

My sister split with her ex 6 years ago (and is happily engaged and expecting a baby with her current fianc\u00e9) and she still gets upset about her ex. Mostly because he's a total POS who screwed her over and went on to have such a carefree, happy life while she was left to pick up the pieces for herself and their two children.\n\nIt's resentment-based. Unless your wife has given any other indication that it has to do with feelings, I'd just write it off as a reaction to being caught off-guard about questions regarding something she's still upset over. She might totally be past it, but it's still a sore spot for her. I wouldn't worry- just be there for her.",

That you will empathize, sit with her, let her feel it, know that you won't make this about your insecurities, and then let her come out of it....\n\nWhich she will probably do a lot quicker if she feels like she is safe with you, fyi rather than having to placate you and justify feeling betrayal over a past relationship, thus creating an imbalance where she can't be open with you and tell you what's on her mind, so she hides these feelings, resentment grows, she feels like she's tiptoeing around you and not being heard herself and... communication breaks down and you wonder why everything feels superficial and no real connection... etc etc.\n\nSounds dramatic but I'm sure you understand my point.\n\nDude, being hurt by past relationship betrayals doesn't equal someone having feelings for the betrayer. It doesn't lessen your relationship.

Layer on top of that the daughter not knowing why they broke up and thinking her mother was over it. Now you have a potential for your wife to also feel betrayed by her daughter and wonder if her daughter misses her ex and/or sides with him. I\u2019m not saying these feelings are right or wrong, just that they may exist.",

Sure, don't cheat and act on it, but I personally can't stop loving someone I have loved deeply. And I've talked to some of my friends and they agree love doesn't fade easily (if it was real).

This new person doesn't cancel out the old friend and everything you went through with them. That's just not how it works.",

It doesn't necessarily mean she's not over him -- instead, the massive pain of that is likely still affecting her, because she's a better person than he was. It probably shattered her. That can take a while to get over. I would use this as a reminder to show her how secure your relationship is, because she's likely terrified inside of being hurt again, not by you but like at all -- you can be a good partner by making her feel safer than she feels in her heart.

Infidelity is a huge enough blow that time may never heal it. Being betrayed by the adult person you're closest to and that you trust with everything fundamentally changes who you are.

The thought of the one's actions still sometimes makes me cry because of how cruel he was verbally/emotionally.  \n\nSometimes old memories can trigger strong emotions.

It could very well be something that she will appreciate in ways she can't fully express if you help her and support her as she works through it.

I am not attracted to him in any way, my current boyfriend is an amazing man who I would not trade for anyone else, but the memory is still a bad memory. If your wife was really badly affected by the experience, maybe it's not the ex she's upset about, but the fact that she was betrayed by the people she loved and thought she loved her. It can for example make her feel unloved, insecure, or remind her of previous experiences. \n\nI think it's important for you to provide a safe, welcoming space to talk about this and together with her try to see why it's still so raw for her until today.

            "Late to the party but yeah, it's natural to remember good and bad feelings you had with a previous partner if they were strong enough. It's been over a year since I left my ex and I still am filled with dread at the smallest things. Waking up all hours thinking she's gonna come and throw summat at me or asking my partner if I can do things I have no need to ask permission for. I think true betrayal stays around so much deeper than good times",
            "Feelings of betrayal are complicated, so I recommend approaching your wife with support and compassion when she has those feelings again.  Encourage her to talk about these feelings in a space where she\u2019s not going to feel judged for what she\u2019s going to express. To be fair, be warned that your ego might not like what its going to hear, either. (It helps me to mentally recommit to my wife each time before asking her questions that I know I\u2019m not fully prepared for.) If you find yourself in over your head, be willing to help your wife seek professional help to work through her feelings.\n\n",
            "I would say focus on her feelings of pain first. Then, when, with time, when she\u2019s healed, focus on whether she still has any interest in him. \n\nIf you\u2019re both strong and if the two of you communicate well and you\u2019re both honest, she\u2019ll probably just repeat what she already said: that she has no interest in him whatsoever. It\u2019s just pain. ",
            "I'm happy, in love with someone I have known for years and probably knows me better than I know myself. Yet I can still wake up crying because of a guy I let go 14 years ago. He got his dream job opportunity. He offered to stay but I knew how much it meant to him. I wouldn't give up my bloke even if this man in my dreams turned up on the doorstep tomorrow bearing a diamond ring. But every now and again I wake up crying about him. ",

It just...fades into a dull ache that hovers in the background, waiting to be summoned when you're feeling nostalgic for the mistakes you've made.\"\n\nThis is how I feel. Thinking about the heartbreak I went through with my ex over 5 years ago still puts me in a foul mood. I have no desire to be with her at all but the pain is still real and it may always be.",
            "That\u2019s emotional trauma for you. It\u2019s okay",
            "I agree with what many are saying here. Although my ex and I have been broken up for almost 5 years and I, 100%, have no positive feelings towards him, I recently crossed paths with him TWICE within 2 hours at NBA game.  I had pretty vivid nightmares that my fianc\u00e9 treated me horribly like my ex did for about 3 days after I saw him. It\u2019s not him that makes me emotional because I miss him or anything, but seeing him triggered memories of the pain I went through with him and it got me upset. \n\nPart of it for me is also thinking back at it hurts because the signs were obvious. I could\u2019ve been smarter, I should\u2019ve been stronger...it\u2019s more self-criticizing than anything else. ",
            "My ex of 6 years was awful to me and we broke up 15 years ago. I still have pain and a visceral reaction when things come up. I have an amazing husband that treats me great. The pain has nothing to do with him and it has nothing to do with feelings that I don't have for my ex. The only thing I can relate it to is PTSD.",
            "A woman I know was in a relationship many years ago and will still react (sometimes in anger, sometimes sobbing) when someone mentions her ex or what he did to her. She hates him with a passion, but will still cry when she thinks about him sometimes. She\u2019s been married to her current husband for 11 years if that tells you how long ago her relationship with her ex was. Some psychological wounds cut deep. ",
            "My ex cheated for 6 years out of the 8 we were together. He made me feel crazy, and insecure and said it was the reason we were never going to get married. He married his longtime side piece after I found out about the cheating and dumped him. It took a long time to get over it. I just saw a picture of him recently and I got mad all over again for the time I wasted with him. It takes a bit. She loves you but that doesnt fix the hurt she experienced in her past.",
            "My ex wife and I separated in 2013\n\nI am now married to a wonderful woman who is definitely an upgrade from the last. \n\nMy ex wife is still a lying POS who could never respect me enough to put men in their place when they'd make a move on her. And oh yea she also cheated on me during the final year of our marriage. ",
            "I don\u2019t get your point man. Just because she\u2019s over him doesn\u2019t mean that what he did didn\u2019t leave a scar. Betrayal hurts on a deeper level. A friend of mine backstabbed me like 10 years ago but it still hurts when I think about it. Be a bit more understanding, it\u2019s kinda mean that you\u2019re getting suspicious of her..",
            "Similar story to everyone else but I'm now in a happy relationship with a lovely man but I still don't like to talk about my ex and how we broke up, who is a good friend of my new partner. It gets me so angry even though I have moved past it, it's just a very sore spot and I think your wife has a right to still be upset about the betrayal she went through, no matter how long the time or how much she loves you, doesn't change the past (unfortunately).",
            "Whoa!             \n\nLeft her for a good friend of hers?\n\n\nNaw man, that\u2019s double betrayal! ",
            "I wouldn't sweat it that much. I still have memories of such things. Its a pretty normal response when something like that happens to you... I think anyways. Do something nice for the family.",
            "She was traumatized by the betrayal. So it\u2019s the trauma that makes her react that way. Not her feelings for the ex. I know you\u2019ve found your peace with the situation. I\u2019m happy for you. ",
            "The feelings of being cheated on never go away, she does not love him trust me- she just has such a strong emotional reaction cause it was traumatic. my boyfriend got cheated on- everytime the subject comes up its always a hot topic. I got cheated on as well- always will be mad about it, think about it from time to time but no I have never loved those people. the minute you find out someone cheats on you it's like you split, its so unsettling.",
            "This is a normal reaction. My ex had cheated on me and at the time I actually wasn\u2019t too upset or terribly emotional over it. I had wanted it to end and found out after. However one day in a new relationship we watched some movie (can\u2019t even remember what), and the plot was wayyyy too similar to the story of how my ex and I split, and the main character has an affair and I surprised both of us by bursting into tears. He jumped up and removed the dvd with tears in his eyes breaking it in half and apologizing. It was funny at the time because I kept apologizing for crying while he apologized for not thinking about how the plot might be triggering. But it wasn\u2019t to do with feelings for my ex, just the grief suddenly surged up. Shame, anger, sadness, bittersweet. Grief is a natural process. It can come back up no matter how many years passed. I do still love my ex without for a second wanting to be back in a relationship. Some people stay in an anger state over loss because that\u2019s easier for them. Don\u2019t mistake grief for longing. If you loved a dog you couldn\u2019t keep due to aggression, and have a moment of grief with a new dog it doesn\u2019t diminish your love. If you lost a child and grieve it doesn\u2019t diminish your love of a new child. ",
            "No one can read her mind. Maybe it was the feelings of betrayal. But what if it was feelings for him? I would suggest thinking through what that would mean to you. Does it actually, in any way, invalidate how genuine your relationship is, or how special the love is that the two of you have now found? \nI will never be over my ex. I gave it time (years, he was not my first bf, I was not a teen), I gave it distance, the break-up made sense... but it just didn't work for me. I consider myself defective and wonder if it's wrong for me to be in the serious relationship I am in now. I love my SO but my life and love with him is different, so it really has no impact on the life AND love I had with my ex. Should it have? Sometimes I wonder why we expect that loving one person will magically cause your previous love for another to fade. What if it doesn't work like that for her? Will you spend your relationship with her feeling defensive, compared and insecure? Or do you have the courage (and I am not diminishing how hard this is) to be so trusting and vulnerable with your wife that you can fully believe in and invest in your love together, knowing that a part of her heart does and may always belong to another, to the past. If you can do this, you can talk to her about it. And maybe she'd be able to really about it with you, which could be powerful for both of you. \nAll that said, maybe for her it was just the betrayal. :D Protecting SUPER hard here... but it's one possibility. \n",
            "That can totally be traumatizing for a person to go through. It can really mess with your self-concept. Being reminded you weren't good enough for someone can be immensely painful and humiliating. ",
            "I don't think I can read anymore replys, most of the reply I've seen, most of you I feel you need to first understand that you're hurt and still are hurt after all the time that has passed and you are because you still haven't gotten over whatever happened to your relationship. If you can read this and think to yourself this doesn't apply to me or this guy doesn't know what he's talking about, your ego is preventing you from moving on. When faced with objection we have to control the urge to fight objection and try to use it to better our selves. It's very hard so practice and it'll become easier. \n\nYour wife's response is only because she is still hurt by what happen, and that's okay because most people don't realize that they haven't gotten over something because of their ego tell them of what they want and not what they need. It's hard for people to let go and also hard to understand why or what they need to do to move forward. \n\nI don't have a single bad thing to say about any of my ex girlfriends. One of my ex's cheated on me, I thought I was over her in 2 days (lol), in reality it took me 3 years to get over her. I realized when a friend sat with me and asked where I saw myself in the future and all I responded with was what I don't want, and she said to me that not only is none of that positive, she said I was hold onto my past and using to feel sorry for myself. The entire time I was thinking, wow she doesn't know me, that's not me at all, no one can understand me on this level especially when they're so happy with their life. Before I could speak she said, let me tell you in your own words quote to quote exactly how I responded to a simple question. When I heard, my ego, my thinking just stopped and I realized that she was right. Also I realized that there's was a lot of things in my life that I needed to let go. \n\nThe greatest thing I took from this was that, I need to understand the image I project, the way people see or view me, is mostly based on what I show people. So whenever people say things about me and I hear it a least more than once, I don't mentally reject any of it, I think how I can improve myself because this isn't the image I want to project, it's not how I view myself. It may seem like this is out to please other people but it's not, it's 100% for yourself. We don't live on this planet by ourselves so how people view you will reflect back to you and hurt only you in the end. \n\nHowever your wife needs positive people to talk to, and when you talk to your wife about it, don't take sides. Yes it's okay to acknowledge when something sound bad or good, not right and to express how you feel about people or things like that without being direct to said person's . It's not good to take sides in any conversation that you were never apart of especially if you don't know the person, try to listen and be understanding. She will need to talk about it a lot of course when she's ready, just be prepared to hear it a million times. \n\nShe could try confronting her pain more and replacing it with something positive, kind of like seeing the positivity in everything. She'll become a stronger person when she gets passed it and she'll learn to deal with future pain a lot better. There are a lot of different videos on YouTube like spiritual leaders that help people with multiple things like turning toxic thoughts into something positive and useful. Even motivational speakers like Eric Thompson. If you want to improve yourself you have to take the steps to do so. Take small step because they lead to big ones. \n\nAlso please remember that kids have no filter, especially as they approach their teens, they can understand things a lot more but still no filter. Maybe there was something that reminded her of him and decided to ask her my mom. Kids don't have common sense we have to teach it to them. Because she's a kid I think she deserves a pass but it should be explained to her if she doesn't know that a topic like that can be sensitive for some people and shouldn't be asked lightly. If you treat a kid like you know more than them because you're older and obviously know more it shows kids understand this and react differently than if you were to talk to them like that's not a factor and as if you were teaching someone older. Kids aren't stupid they act stupid. Lol we were all there once.\n\nAnyhow just remember, There is no such thing as a good or bad experience, there is just experience. \n\nHope this helps.",
            "She wasn\u2019t just betrayed by him, but also by a good friend. I\u2019m sure it left an icky feeling deep inside. It definitely doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not enough or that she still pines for him. She was deeply hurt and hasn\u2019t fully healed. There\u2019s prob a lot of anger and a whole bunch of other emotions when it comes to the ex. with you by her side, she will get over it someday. ",
            "Just for some perspective: I have an ex I don't talk about. Like, at all. He didn't cheat on me or anything, but the end of our relationship was ugly and there was an incident a few years later where he betrayed my trust again. It still makes me upset to think/talk about, not because I still have feelings for him, but because what he did hurt me so badly and messed up my view of men for a long time. If someone brought him up out of the blue, particularly in front of others and especially asking what happened, I'd probably have a similar reaction to your wife. Some people just do that to you.",
            "I\u2019ve read a lot of great advice for talking to your wife and I see your edit. \n\nJust wanted to chime in that you both need to explain this to her daughter. That it isn\u2019t about love or wishing things had turned out differently. It\u2019s about the pain of betrayal both by her ex and her ex close friend. \n\nAbove all her daughter needs to know, see & feel you and your wife are solid. Also that neither of you blame her for asking that question. ",
            "First of all. Don't panic and make negative assumptions. That will kill a relationship soooo fast. \n\nThat said. People don't cry for no reason. Obviously there's a lot of pain on her part, and I would imagine she's doing her best to brush it off, but I personally don't buy the \"I don't have any feelings for him anymore\". People don't cry about something they say they're over. But the good news is that doesn't have to be a horrible thing, it's pretty natural. It can definitely be overcome. \n\nFor the record, when my most serious (and first) legitimate girlfriend and I split, I actually did the breaking up, and it would choke me up thinking about it for like 5 years too, and we were only together 2 years and not even married. ",
            "I can only imagine how humiliating that must be. It's less about him and more about how much what he did hurt her self esteem and pride. I can totally understand. Just comfort and reassure her and push her to do things wich will empower her and help her reclaim her femininity and confidences. Maybe sexy couples tango lessons? ",
            "The pain from betrayal can be long-lasting, and those feelings can have no romantic intentions to them. I still hold a lot of pain from my ex cheating on me two years ago, but I feel no love for him what so ever. I think she may be in the same place",
            "I understand why this would be confusing or hurtful for you. But loss can have a lasting effect, even when you\u2019ve mostly moved on. An example would be the death of a loved one, though it is different. Years later you might have a day where you just miss them too much and break down. My grandparents died 12 years ago, and I still have these moments. \n\nShe not only lost a love, but a good friend. And that is a very big betrayal. It doesn\u2019t sound likes she\u2019s dwelling on a daily basis, only that it was brought up and it brought back some of those awful feelings. It\u2019s also possible that she never really processed them to begin with, which can make it worse. Because if you bottle it up, it will eventually come out. \n\nShe might need to talk to someone, but my guess is that it will continue to fade over time. ",
            "When I found out my first love, and the person I had thought I was going to marry from the age of twelve, had cheated on me with my long time bully, and gotten her pregnant, I was shattered.It still hurts to think about it, twenty years later.  I still refuse to speak to him, and if he or that person he cheated on me with come up in conversation with friends, I excuse myself until I am confident they have moved on to another topic. I have NEVER spoken about it with anyone. Ever. I refuse to acknowledge any of it. He was dead to me the day I found out, and while friends clearly figured out what happened, no one has heard my feelings on it. Because it hurt so bad. It still feels like a knife in my chest every time I think about it. Even just typing this out.\n\nThe first time my (now ex) husband got caught cheating on me was nearly eight years ago. And often when I think about what I saw when I caught him, my fists clench in rage from it.  That was not even the worst of the betrayals I dealt with from that vile bastard, but it is still one of two incidents that I never fail to viscerally react to when I think of with him.\n\nThese are people that I am 100% over. But that does not mean that the vile way they treated me does not still piss me off.  And sometimes, it will hit me like a truck, and I will cry, because I am a crier.It does not mean I miss them, it means I am human.  I imagine it is the same for your wife.  Betrayal like that cuts really deep. And because often women are made to feel like if we had been 'better'm we could have kept the person from hurting us, it will often leave us with insecurities. What could we have done differently. Why were we not enough?  That last one is a HUGE issue with me. I genuinely feel like I am cursed to never be 'enough' for a man to care for me, because of these betrayals.Be gentle with her, and remind her that he was a fool to discard a diamond like her.",
            "This pain doesn\u2019t have anything to do with feelings for her ex.  It has to do with insecurities about her self-worth that he trampled over by leaving her for another woman.  The fact that you\u2019re unnerved by it, shows insecurity for your own value in her eyes.  This is completely normal to question at times in relationships, and it would help to just remind each other how valuable you are to each other.  She still feels devalued when reminded of the incident, talking about it and her value to you will eventually heal that wound.  It could take months, but as someone who\u2019s been there, trust me when I say this has nothing to do with the way she sees you; but she does know how it could or would bother you, and that is probably only making her feel more like she\u2019s not valuable.",

I\u2019m still good friends with people I met through him, and therefore we still run in the same circles. I haven\u2019t seen him since 2013, and he\u2019s also married now. But it was a very rough breakup, he broke my heart in a way I never expected, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get over it. \n\nSometimes people leave permanent scars. It has absolutely nothing to do with how we feel about our new relationships, but it\u2019s there. ",

We all have our hang ups, don\u2019t hold it against her. ",
            "A few months ago I had to talk to my ex (we were together 10 years) over the last car payment he missed. I was definitely anxious talking to him and extremely overwhelmed and hurt because of all the bad things that transpired with us. \n\nAt the time I talked to my now fianc\u00e9 about how anxious and upset I was having to speak to my ex. I was crying a lot and felt horrible I was crying about an ex. My fianc\u00e9 told me of a story where he had to encounter an ex after that person hurt him (they weren\u2019t together long, but it still hurt to see her some time later). \n\nHe\u2019s like you and your ex were together 10 years and he did some horrible things to you so it\u2019s completely normal to feel anxious or upset about having to speak with him. It really helped me immensely to hear this. I no longer felt weird or bad about that sadness and it really helped me to hear my feelings were normal. It was a moment I\u2019ll never forget and makes me thankful I\u2019m engaged to this person. \n\nIt\u2019s normal to feel what you need to feel. We all react different ways to different stimuli and sometimes the past hurts. I wasn\u2019t crying because I still had feelings, I was crying because a lot of painful memories sprang to the surface. This person robbed me, lied to me, used me, and didn\u2019t respect me. \n\nThe last car payment was taken care of so I no longer need to have contact with him, which is the best!",
            "Dude are you crazy... what if one day he decided to look her up, I don\u2019t think that you should be blind to the idea that she might still have feelings for him, if she was truly over him then she wouldn\u2019t have those feelings and it\u2019s been 4 years and you guys are married now, maybe she is using you as a blanket for her fear of being alone, clearly she had abandonment issues so I would seek therapy for her to really try to get over him you can\u2019t be the one to do it, you can\u2019t let this fester because it will come out later ",
            "I\u2019ve been betrayed before as well. It can be hard when you think back on it. Don\u2019t blame her for having feelings about something like that.

            "To add to what everyone has said, can you talk to your wife's daughter about this?

It doesn't mean she mourns the loss of the relationship. To her it was a kind of trauma that hit her hard and probably made her question her judgement and self-worth and her daughter accidently picked at that scab. It just so happens to be about her ex, but maybe that's almost secondary. If I were you I would do everything I could to reinforce how secure and loved she is by you in your relationship.

For some people, some of these feelings come from childhood too and that's why they feel it so much.

A word to the wise: don't act jealous or make a big deal over it, because that will make you look insecure and will only create MORE problems and might even make her miss her ex more.

            "Unless your wife is showing other signs that she hasn't gotten over him (contact, talking about him a lot, comparing you to him, etc) then I think you need to realize that strong sad feelings =/= still loving for or caring for a person. Being left by your partner is traumatic and often embarrassing and shakes a person to their core, still feeling those feelings a few years later seems pretty natural to me. ",
            "Unless she has given you a reason not to trust her, you should believe her on her feelings. If you can\u2019t seem to let it go, I would have a sit-down conversation and let her know your concerns and that you care for her.",
            "I had my bf of over 3 years break up with me out of nowhere and was engaged to someone else less than a month later. I never confirmed cheating but I have some strong suspicions. He also never told his family that we broke up. I talked to his sister a week later and she had no idea. Neither did his parents. This happened 6 years ago and I still get mad when I think about it. Her reaction was totally justified. Betrayal is rough shit. It takes time to get through it. Give her space but support her. Be understanding. ",
            "No matter how happy she is now, the pain of the past will follow her. If someone prods about a painful memory such as a cheating incident, its still painful when its brought up... I relate 100% to how she felt, its almost like victim shaming without realizing it. Her daughter was insensitive (due to being a child and acting like whatever happened was nothing substantial) and maybe your wife was hormonal - too much at once. ",
            "Take what she says at face value. My current girlfriend still holds hurt over her ex. And that was years ago. I think it has to do with her fearing that I may do the same to her. ",
            "You never forget how someone made you feel. \n\nIt seemed like a combination of things led for her to be a bit weaker emotionally and have that hit her harder than she expected. \n\nAlcohol does funny things. And when you're surrounded by loved ones you tend to be more emotionally vulnerable. Her daughters question probably surprised her. \n\nI wouldnt think she still has feelings. The fact she cries when she thinks of him means she feels nothing but hurt by him. ",
            "Dude, don't make this about you. Maybe she should have processed things more than she has, but it's not about her secretly being in love and what that secretly means about you. What you do is be supportive and encourage her to process the betrayal.",
            "Hi OP, I see a,lot of comments about treating the wife with extra care and love to help her get over this , but not many of them address you too, \nTbh I\u2019d be pissed if my husband started crying over an ex. I\u2019m married to him and wouldn\u2019t expect him to harbor any love or sadness from any other woman ( who he dated ) . It would be perfectly fine for you to take so,e time away from the wife and reevaluate your relationship if that is something you are really offended with. You don\u2019t owe your wife anything here, it\u2019s her hurt she has to deal with ",
            "Yeah I mean, those probably weren't tears of loss over the ex, they were tears over the emotional magnitude of betrayal and hurt. I presume she's dealt with it to the point that the tears surprised her too, but if those tears happen more frequently than you realize, that's something to discuss.\n\nTwo nights ago, we got home from a wedding reception kinda tipsy and our young dog climbed up to our bed. She promptly peed on a blanket that she's peed on lots of times when she was a puppy (it was the first time the blanket came out since those days). My normally calm, doesn't-drink-often husband cursed loudly, flung the blanket on the ground, and yelled about our dog sitter not taking the dogs out and how sick he was of not having good sitters. This was wrong on a few counts, but the booze made him overreact. I went silent. It reminded me so very much of my abusive ex that part of me recoiled inside, waiting for that anger to turn on me like I had come to expect from the ex. It didn't, but I let my husband know right there that I cannot be around that kind of behavior, not anymore. He apologized right away and said he didn't ever want to remind me of him.\n\nThat feeling came flooding back five years later, that kind of fear and hurt never really goes away. If your wife still feels a deep wound from her time with the ex and that breakup, she should perhaps talk to someone about it so it doesn't keep affecting her daily life. I am, it's helping.",
            "She may be reacting to the memory of how that event made her feel about herself, as opposed to any current feelings regarding the ex himself.",
            "She may have cried over embarrassment or anger. ",
            "I know it\u2019s hard to understand but I promise you there is a very good chance she\u2019s crying more about the pain and less about him. She\u2019s got you now and a family and she\u2019s probably totally happy and in love with you, but when someone is  hurt like that and if the breakup was nasty, the pain doesn\u2019t go away just because you\u2019re on a better place now you know?",
            "A lot of people have to move on with their lives without ever getting closure.",
            "It\u2019s probably grief. Intense grief, especially from a betrayal can linger for years. It comes and goes. If the ex really did do a number on your wife, those feelings can come up again, especially when he is brought up. If your wife lingers on him all the time and he is a constant cloud over your marriage, that would be a big problem, but it sounds like this was a momentary lapse into grief, which passed. You just need to give your wife space to grieve and be there for her as she wants you to be. You also need to remember that she loves you and chose to marry you. Here you need to communicate and not accuse. \n\nCommunication and discussing your feelings is key. It is understandable you are hurt by your wife crying over her ex, even if she is crying over how he hurt her instead of missing him. Talk to each other and work it out. ",
            "Honestly bad breakups, especially ones like this where you get left for someone else, can seriously impact your self-esteem and self-worth. Just because remembering all that makes her feel like crap doesn't mean she's necessarily hung up on him, although she could be. \n\nAlso, the fact that he left her for a good friend of hers after 5 years together means that it was a really deep betrayal and that remembering that brings to mind her friend's betrayal as well.\n\nBarring advice from an actual therapist, I would say that both she and you need to accept that she's probably not ever going to get over this in the sense that she will be able to remember these times and not feel overwhelmingly sad. That doesn't mean she isn't happy with you or that she would get back with him given the chance. It just means it is a really painful and personal betrayal that can't really be recovered from.",
            "Many comments about being blindsided are totally correct! I'll add that as a mother, I can attest that it is very painful to have to put on a happy face, in my own home, for my children during dark times. Your wife likely had a lot of dinners with her daughter where she wanted to burst into tears, but instead chatted about the weather. \n\nNow that she is married to you, she let her guard down emotionally, because of your presence and permanence in the home. Celebrate that! If you are comfortable, tell her daughter that you are able and willing to comfort her mom, even if it's a subject from before you were around. Maybe thank her for the time that she was such a loyal child, and say that you appreciate how beautiful her bond with her mom will always be. Be strong, and comfort your wife. Maybe buy your wife flowers or something else visual, so that everyone in the house knows that you are there to comfort and support, and you're not going anywhere. \n\nIf your wife wants to have a big, honest discussion with her daughter about what happened with her ex, that will be much easier if everyone knows that the 12 year old isn't the one who has to \"fix\" mom's feelings. Mom is grown, and mom isn't lonely any more. Then, maybe her daughter can go back to thinking about tests at school and what she wants for Christmas!! ",
            "Can someone think about the children?! (Simpsons meme). But seriously, you guys have to tell the 12yo that she did nothing wrong and that nobody is upset with her. Explain that it was just a bad memory mom had and she can always asks the questions she wants. If needed make a comparison as how it would be for her to be in disneyland and her mom suddenly reminded her of an F she got at school. ",
            "DUDE. IF SHES CRYING ABOUT IT, SHE STILL HAS FEELINGS. \n\nDo you cry when a stranger mistreats you? Most people dont. Because they dont care about them. Hate, anger, bitterness are all symptoms of unreciprocated love. \n\nI'm not saying you should leave, but you should at least know what youre getting into, and not have to lie to yourself about it.",

            "I have been married to my husband longer than the rest of my collective dating history put together. I still cry sometimes when I think about all the shit I went through trying to find him\n\nI cry if I hear songs lyrics that hit too close to home, I cry at the end of every movie, I cry when my cat looks too cute. why WOULDN'T I cry about things that were ACTUALLY painful?? Crying about something is good, it means she's allowing herself to feel bad instad of bottling it up and not processing it. If her parents got divorced when she was 8 and it still bums her out is she allowed to be sad? What about if her dog died when she was 12, is she allowed to be sad about that? So what, you're allowed to be sad, as long as it's not about some guy that stabbed you in your back five years ago that you don't even love anymore? As long as it's not about another man, you're not allowed to be sad?? What if she was raped ten years ago, is she allowed to be sad about that? \n\nI think it's wild that she's upset and you're more upset by what it means FOR YOU than the fact that she's upset?

            "Teenagers are the Worst! Snarky lil know it all's. They think they're so mature and adult with zero experience and zero responsibility. And apparently zero tact. If my daughter did this to me she would have to go live with her dad and mess up his life for awhile.\n\n No one wants to talk about the ex that dumped them with their 12 year old and new husband in the middle of family dinner. Your wife was probably just caught way off guard and felt a rush of pain unexpectedly from what was a painful situation. That's probably the only reason she cried. ",
            "You're internalizing her pain. This is 100% not about you at all. ",
            "I think people just have feelings that don't just go away and like all forms of grief it crops up every now and then sometimes unexpectedly and comes out. For some people that's crying. For some people that's a couple days of bitchiness or being ultra quiet and sulky and you'd never know the difference necessarily.\n\nIt happens from romantic relationships, childhood memories and betrayals by parents, old burned out adult meaningful friendships. \n\nIt has no bearing on the now, and people need to be free to have these feelings, and grieve the moment, and move on. \n\nInstead of agreeing with the 12 year old I think it's easier and provides a healthier perspective to say \"ya a lot of feelings get tied up in adult relationships and we grieve in stages. She's okay, I'll give her a minute then go check in\". \n\nIt's nice your wife shares her feelings with you, she obviously feels you can handle them and feels theirs nothing sinister in her feelings, or she'd probably hide them and not discuss them ( although that in itself isn't necessarily a sign of anything bad as we all cope differently). \n\nJust let her feel like she can have her feelings and lean into you. Be her friend in this moment as well. Your relationship bond can feel stronger for being so human and raw with one another.",
            "That pain can linger for a long time. My ex-fiance and I broke up six years ago. He cheated on me and left me for someone else. I'm happily married (5 years together, 2 years married) but if I dwell on the pain or someone asks about it, I will still break down and cry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen her daughter asked her the question, she probably didn't expect it and felt ambushed."

I know this makes me sound like a shit person but honestly I'm just a very touchy guy and express my affection by touching and being touched. Not being able to cuddle or hold hands or sleep next to my girlfriend was not going to work out for me and just felt like a constant tease you'd get from a long distance relationship where you'd think about holding and cuddling your gal or guy but just don't end up doing it. Honestly it was not gonna work out. \n\nI brought my gf to my house after telling her we had to chat. I started by telling her that I'm really sorry and like her very much but I don't think things will work out with our different cuddling preferences. She started crying and said she didn't want me to be turned off by this but she actually loves cuddling but has a \"sweating disorder\" and when she cuddles she gets super sweaty like I'm talking hella sweaty. She said her ex boyfriend dumped her because of her sweating and she said that's why she didn't want to cuddle with me. She said the same thing happens when she holds hands and she gets super sweaty. She said she was afraid cuddling with me would make me leave her like with her ex in the past.\n\nI felt bad that I've been giving her so much shit about it and it was like an insecurity she had and I told her that I don't really care if she sweats on me its all good. She laughed and said \"no I actually sweat buckets\" and I told her \"can you sweat buckets on me?\" :P she thought about it and then she said \"okay but don't break up with me over it if I sweat too much!\" In a joking voice. \n\nShe layed beside me and we cuddled and it felt so fucking good to finally feel that with her. She actually managed to sweat so much that my shirt was pretty wet and the bed sheet was soaked and I told her that I found it pretty cool. She said that she is so happy that someone appreciates cuddles and doesn't mind the sweating and I was just so happy we were finally cuddling. I told her I didn't mind getting soaked cuddling and said \"at least now we can have kisses in the rain in bed\" and she couldn't stop laughing. She asked if we could hold hands in bed to show me how sweaty her hands get and again my hands were wet as hell which I didn't mind. She said \"if you ever need to wash your hands and there's no sink available just hold my hands!\" Which was really cute.\n\nIt's been an amazing day and I'm just really happy things worked out. I told her that if she felt like things her ex said to her were hurting her and still making her feel insecure she should really consider maybe seeing a therapist to help her feel more comfortable. She agreed and said that the fact that I like her sweating lifted a burden off her shoulders since she loves cuddles. Hopefully all goes well!\n\nTldr; she is an excessive sweater that's all :P",

            "I have a sweating disorder too.  It fucking sucks. My  husband and I recently went on vacation to Hawaii and we couldn't cuddle or have sex pretty much the entire time because I was just disgusting and wet and slippery and sticky and it wasn't just uncomfortable for me.  This guy never gives a shit about my sweating (he even thinks it's kinda cute), but even *he* wasn't putting up with it while we were there. \n\nAnyway, she's probably been shamed for this shit her entire life.  I know I have.  It really, really limits you.  Like, I remember going to church as a kid and leaving during the Lord's Prayer, pretending I had to go to the bathroom, just to avoid holding hands and touching people. I have to carefully purchase clothing that won't show huge sweat stains. Certain career choices, like massage therapy and doing hair or makeup, are totally out.  I can't do yoga. It's a goddamn nightmare.\n\nThanks, on behalf of all the sweaty people out there, for being super cool to your girl. She's really, really gonna love the hell out of you. ",

            "im so happy for you op. youre a great guy! \n\np.s. if she cares enough she can go to a doctor, they have shots for this weekly. if she doesn't, no biggy!",
            "You might want to invest in some towels...",
            "Lovely to see a story with a happy ending :) Sometimes admitting top issues that aren't \"normal\" can be so hard, somebody who understands and makes you not feel like a freak is amazing. Thankfully the world is more full of good people than we can even believe! ",
            "Ahh, the power of communication! Good job, OP.",
            "Just don't switch up on her in a few more months/years okay? :/\n*also has hyperhydrosis*",
            "As point of interest since I have this issue and while my bf doesn't hugely mind my sweating - I personally find it really uncomfortable and definitively not sexy to be soaking sheets like that... was just talking to my doctor about this and there are medications that address this. Might be worth looking into :)",
            "I'm so happy for you!\n\nMake sure to reassure her that you love cuddling with her and love sleeping beside her, every so often, even when the insecurity hasn't come up lately. She'll appreciate it. :) She's a little traumatized from a hurtful incident in her past, so even if she seems totally good with everything she's definitely still going to feel some anxiety sometimes!",
            "Your girlfriend has hyperhidrosis. I have it too, but only in my hands and feet. There are treatments she can look into, there are pills that can help with full-body sweating and topical and botox treatment options for hands.",
            "It's odd that a story about sweating is the sweetest thing I've read all day. ",
            "It always comes back to communication :)",
            "So cute.\n\nHypergydrosis. I have it too. It was localized to my underarms, so I actually got surgery for it. But now I sweat everywhere *except* my hands and underarms. It can be buckets if I'm out in the sun long enough.",
            "Glad this worked out! I [obviously] could not deal with no cuddles!",
            "Open communication saves the day again.",
            "Hyperhidrosis? Has she been medically assessed by a doctor? There may be some underlying thing that might be able to be resolved/treated.",
            "I had the same condition and got surgery to fix it, it was a life changer. There's also a lot of topical prescriptions I used as well. There's a hospital in Boston I went to with a whole dept devoted to this condition so feel free to PM me for more info! ",
            "Heya OP. I know that this is gonna be buried (aka you'll never read it)\n\nAfter reading through your post, I realized I was basically the guy version of your girlfriend.\n\nI can totally understand how it feels like to have a sweat problem. I can get all anxious and shit whenever I have to shake someone's hand because it's all damp and very hot for some reason. And the more I think about it the worse the problem gets. \n\nIt doesn't help that my friends keep showing their disgust and it makes me feel like shit and insecure. My girlfriend doesn't mind it (or so she says) but sometimes it makes me not want to have any physical contact with her. \n\ntldr **Thank you for reassuring us sweaty people that there are some of you out there who don't mind (hell, even like) it.**",

            "Awe ;-; \n\nI've always thought its worth explaining what upsets you before cutting things off cause some people legit didn't realize or may have a reason that makes you consider! I'm so glad this had a happy ending :)",
            "This girl could be me, except just with my hands and feet. The minute anyone says the word \"sweat\" I start sweating (no seriously - my boyfriend thinks it's hilarious). He calls me frog hands. It used to be embarrassing but now I joke that if he makes me too mad I'll \"ink\" on him. You sound like a good boyfriend!",
            "My brain is calling it \"a rollercoaster of events and emotions\"....still better written than a tv show. ",
            "fyi I am a moist sleeper. I sweat and drool... my husband has chronically sweaty hands. we don't care. honestly. I would take his sweaty touch over the velvety soft, dry hands of any super star/celebrity. feeling connected and touching are so super important in relationships.",
            "This is way cute and very strange conclusion at the same time. Lol. Sounds like all is well!",
            "Happy to hear it sounds like it worked out perfectly for you both in the end. She found someone who accepts her for who she is and you can be happy going forward with that intimacy.\n\nGood luck",
            "This is definitely nothing you should come up with in a conversation with your girlfriend as I think she would feel hurt for telling her \u2013 but I'm an extreme sweater, too. Like ... I sweat so much when I'm nervous or it's just a bit too hot. The odd thing is, that I only start to sweat on my head and it comes dripping down like I'm standing under the shower.\n\nI've tried a bunch of things. But there's only one thing that really worked for me. It's a medicine called \"Bornaprine\". It's very effective and I only use it in small doses, otherwise I would completely dry out. I also only use in the the summer period, cause I can deal with my sweat in the cooler periods. It works just fine. I would only bring it up if she says something like \"I would like to check if there is a drug that can help me with me sweating all the time\" and then I would pretend to google and show it to her then. I think it's important that you don't give her the feeling that you care too much about it. And I'm not saying that it's a good thing to use this drug. You need a doctor to give you a prescription for it (at least in Germany) and you definitely will have a feeling of a dry throat and mouth. So that's not cool. But if she's like me and feels like it's uncomfortable for her to sweat in public, I would recommend it.",

            "I mean shit, I'm not trying to be disrespectful by any means but have you guys considered a fan? Or lighter blankets? I too get pretty hot when I sleep but I have to have it cold to sleep. I would rather be cold and get warm than the alternative. Either way just throwing that out there. Congrats btw, this reminds of the time I never took my shirt off around the girl I was dating at the time. I was pretty fat and didn't want to expose that to her. She finally confronted me and I poured the beans and explained I was teased heavily as a kid. She laughed and said she didn't care that I was fat. Mind blown. Communication is a motherfucker. Congrats again and good luck. ",
