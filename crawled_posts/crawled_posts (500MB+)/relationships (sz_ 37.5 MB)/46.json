        "selftext": "Hi all. \n\nI'm a law student, and met my boyfriend Tom through mutual friends around the start of our first year. We've been together for eight months now and its the happiest I've ever been. Tom is a medical student, and we're both the first people in our families to make it to higher education. \n\nIn Tom's class there is a girl called Isabel. Tom told me she's top of the year and word is going around that she's a ''future world changer'' or something like that. They weren't close friends but she used to help him study sometimes, he says shes so smart that ''anyone would be an idiot to turn down her help''. \n\nAnyway I didn't meet her until me and Tom were grabbing some food and she came into the same place with her girl friends. The first thing I noticed about her was that she was absolutely gorgeous. Literally a solid 10. They started chatting and she asked who I was. Tom said (and thinking about this makes me smile) with a huge smile that I was his girlfriend, and Isabel's response was to say ''Thought you had better taste than that?''. I was a bit hurt and Tom was confused, but neither of us thought much of it. \n\nAnyway, we didn't deal with her again until a month or so later when Tom's flatmates left the place to him so he invited me over. We were watching a movie when Tom got a call from Isabel, who was crying, saying she'd been kicked out of a club for being stoned and it was nearby his place, asking if she could stay the night until the morning. Tom wanted to say no but I didn't want to just leave her out there. \n\nWhen she got in she was absolutely drunk and high as possible. Giggling and laughing and reeking of weed. Her clothes were ruined from where she'd spilt her drink over them. I helped clean her up. I always bring a change of clothes when I stay away, but I gave them to her to make her more comfortable. Instead of saying thank you she tried to say how ''cheap'' my clothes were and how she wouldn't be seen dead dressed like that. I tried to tell her not to speak to me like that but she just made fun of my accent and how I speak. I put it down to the alcohol/drugs and didn't hold it against her. \n\nEver since then Tom started to distance himself from her. He still accepted her help with work but nothing else beyond that, and even that came to an end after she told him she'd only keep helping him if he went out with her. The final straw came not long after we came back for second year. Myself and Tom went out clubbing. Isabel and her friends were there. Tom got extremely drunk and was being sick in the toilets. He could barely stand up and was confused. One of Isabels friends came up to us and announced to him that she'd seen me kissing another guy while he was being sick. Tom got hugely emotional and wanted me to confirm/deny it. It took a lot for me to calm him down and convince him it was a lie, by which point Isabel had already ran over to ''comfort'' him. He realised it was her that made up the lie and shouted at her to leave us alone, and she started crying and went to the security accusing us of acting aggressively towards her, at which point we were both kicked out. \n\nEver since then she has left us alone. We spent Christmas with our families but were together for New Years. After watching the fireworks, we were snuggling in bed when Tom got an insta DM from Isabel. She sent him a few pictures of her with dyed hair and the words ''New Year, New Me.'' Let's just say those pics reveal much more than just her new hair colour. Tom was fuming. He swore at her and blocked her on everything. \n\nThat's good, but when we go back to uni she's still going to be around. Her and her friends frequent most of the places we go to, and she's still in his class. What's going to stop her from bothering him again? He's said he wants nothing to do with her, but she obviously doesn't feel the same way. \n\nTL;DR: A girl from my boyfriends class acted unpleasantly to me and then tried to break us up, before sending him pictures last night.",

            "That chick is toxic and obsessive. Your boyfriend took the right steps here and has been behaving just the way I would expect a good man to. So bravo to him for how he's handling this.\n\nNo more kindness or \"benefit of the doubt\" should be given to this woman. Assume all behavior from her is going to be rude and manipulative. If you or Tom are out somewhere and run into her, if you do not HAVE to be at that location, then LEAVE. Make sure your mutual friends in his program know the history you posted here, and that they make sure you guys are not invited to the same events she is. I don't know a lot about medical school, but if there are group projects or schoolwork that Tom and Isabel are assigned to do together then make sure professors know about her behavior and ask to be reassigned. \n\nIf she continues this behavior, make sure you have as much documentation of these incidents as possible. Take it to school administrators as evidence of sexual harassment. Make sure the university steps in if the behavior escalates. \n\nOther than that, keep ignoring and block/delete anywhere you haven't already. Eventually she will either get a clue, move on to someone else, or escalate to the point where university administrators have the authority to get involved. Good luck! She sounds like an absolute psycho.",

She obviously thinks she shits gold now...but the real world is pretty political and you don\u2019t get very far not having the sense to play the game. \n\nShe\u2019s a trashy hot mess and, frankly, at this rate no one is going to take her very seriously.

            "Isabel is rude, toxic, psychotic and, by sending Tom those pictures, could be held liable for sexual harassment. I don\u2019t know what Tom\u2019s medical school\u2019s policies are, but at my school the pictures and her other actions would be a HUGE breach of professionalism.  Tom should consider filing a report documenting these things to the school. Judging by her actions, this girl is not fit to be a physician, regardless of how smart she is. ",
            "Like everyone else here: document everything. Anything you don't have proof of still gets written down and put in a timeline. Make this timeline as complete as possible, including when she's made derogatory comments to you or about you. Include the names of people around you and where you were when things were said. The more you put down, the better and stronger your chances of getting a restraining order against her are should she escalate things.\n\nYour BF needs to work with you on this timeline, and above all he needs to never be alone with her. Not because you can't trust him, but because he needs witnesses and alibis for when she accuses him of doing something terrible to her after she realizes that he won't leave you for her. Because that's going to happen. Look up the recording laws where you live, and the penalties for breaking those laws, because if possible you and your BF should be recording any interaction with her",

TL;DR;\n\nI would have him start blocking her on any social media, and if she reaches out to him anyway, save the messages followed by, \"Don't message me.

I'm glad Tom finally wised up and blocked her, but he still accepted help from her in spite of her shitty behavior.\n\nBoth of you just need to blatantly ignore her. If she approaches, walk away and don't turn around or respond to her no matter what she says.

            "Honestly, I know you don\u2019t trust her and we can all tell she\u2019s manipulative and toxic, but if you trust Tom enough to be in a relationship with him you should trust him enough to steer clear of her. In a relationship, you\u2019re essentially trusting someone to not cheat on you and he\u2019s made a lot of efforts to be nice to her but also not disrespect your relationship. At this point I would just ask to have a conversation with him and tell him you would feel more comfortable if he didn\u2019t study with her anymore. No matter how \u201cintelligent\u201d she is, she\u2019s a crazy person who can\u2019t be trusted. Trust him to do what he can (not sit next to her, study with her, or speak to her in general) because your relationship can only be controlled here. If she forces herself on to him again, consider it assault. It\u2019s not okay! No matter what she does, Tom is in control here on your side. If she continues to harass him, I\u2019d suggest collecting evidence (videos, screenshots) of her being crazy and taking it to the appropriate people at your school so something can be done about it. I\u2019m sorry this is happening to him and to you, but her actions shouldn\u2019t be excused because she\u2019s a female. It\u2019s continued for long enough, if she won\u2019t stop then I\u2019d suggest finding a way outside your circle to do something about it. Clearly speaking to her and ignoring her isn\u2019t enough! ",

Lawyers get an awful lot of slaps on the wrist). There are plenty of other smart people to study with and networking in undergrad isn't quite the do-or-die thing it becomes postgraduate, so even if she's got connections at this point it doesn't really matter much.

She's never talked about remarrying and has never even dated to my knowledge.\n\nTwo years ago she met Kim at one of my swim meets and they became instant friends. I found it kind of annoying at first, but the last couple years she's been happier than I ever remember my mom being. They go out to dinner once a week, they talk and text a lot, etc. \n\nEarlier this week I had to fix a software problem on my mom's computer and I opened her browser history and saw a page about having safe sex for two women. All of a sudden everything clicked. My mom working late hours at work a lot recently, my mom hiding her laundry from me, things like that.\n\nI want to tell my mom that I'm really happy for her that she has a girlfriend and she doesn't have to hide it from me, but I feel like going 'Hey mom, I know you're munching Kim's rug' wouldn't be good. \n\nAdvice?\n\n[UPDATE]: Lots of really good advice! We both have Monday off so I'll come up with something to say to her then.\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: Pretty sure my mom's 'best friend' is her girlfriend, how do I tell her I know and she doesn't need to hide?",

            "I waited for my mom to tell me. My friends teased me about her and her partner in high school. Somebody saw them kissing in the city we lived near. I pretty much knew before that but it was complicated.\n\n\nShe told me on the drive up to college. It was cute, she had a whole little speech. I told her that I kinda already knew and that I was happy she had found someone to pair up with that clearly brought her joy. That was 18 years ago! They are still together and so happy it's gross. \n\n\nI think it was a much bigger deal to her than to me. I had gay friends, I helped start a lgbtq group at my high school. She grew up when things were different. Maybe your mom needs time. I think the best thing you can do is make your acceptance clear and give her opportunities to share. I bet she will tell you soon enough, especially if she is confident that her relationship is long term.",
            "This is so interesting because the convention wisdom for parents with closeted gay kids is to let the kid come out on their schedule. You make clear that you love and accept them, and drop a few hints, and let them do it when they're ready. \n\nWith your mom I'd imagine you could be more proactive, but if you wanted to let her be the one to explicitly say it, you could try the following ideas:\n\n\"I've noticed how much happier you are with Kim around. I really love seeing this side of you.\" \n\nIf she doesn't bite, you might bring up a discussion about a friend or classmate who has come out, and just say something like, \"It's really great to see how Debbie is finally comfortable being herself. I know she was worried that people would accept her but we all do.\" \n\nAnother possibility would be to, if there's a nice dinner or something you and your mom are doing, or something like that, you can just say \"It'd be lovely if Kim came as well, if you wanted to invite her.\"\n\nThat all being said, I really do like u/Fabri-geek's suggestion if you're comfortable going that far.",
            "I just want to comment that they may not have been dating this entire time. That browser history actually makes me think if they are dating its a recent development. I would maybe just make a positive lgbt comment if you were watching a show or something with a gay/bi character but otherwise I don't think you need to explicitly say anything.",
            "It seems likely that Kim has become your mom's lover. But I don't think it's a **sure** thing. Your mom could be in denial. She could be curious, but not yet have taken any actual steps in that direction. She could be hopeful, but afraid that Kim won't reciprocate, or even afraid that revealing her feelings would chase Kim off. So I don't think it's fair to assume that you know what's going on. \n\nTherefore, I prefer the more subtle approaches I've seen in other comments. Like, \"You've been so much happier since you met Kim. I'm happy for you.\" As opposed to ones that make stronger assumptions, like, \"I know you're a lesbian and I approve.\"",

            "You are correct that that exact phrasing would not be great!\n\nI think you can start by telling your mom how much she means to you and how much you love and appreciate her and want her to be happy. If you have something kind to say about Kim, mention that.",
            "Honestly I think you\u2019ve jumped to a conclusion that has the possibility of not being correct. It could be she\u2019s interested in Kim but they\u2019re not actually dating. It could be she\u2019s interested in another woman. \n\nI just wouldn\u2019t open the conversation by including your assumption. Make it more about accepting and loving her and not the premise of her and Kim being a couple",
            "I just didn't get how is it clear that Kim is the woman she's dating. To me, the fact she met her 2 years ago and is only now searching about safe sex with women would mean she just now met someone new.\n\nOf course, it could be that they just now became more than friends but from what you told us, I don't get how this was your first assumption, could you explain?\n\nBecause I feel people are giving you advices based on the assumption she is dating Kim, the best friend, and that may not be the case and it would be awkward",
            "Well actually my brother did the same with our mom. My best advice just ask instead of announcing that you know, and make sure she knows that you love her no matter how she answers. \n\nI was in my mid 20\u2019s and my brother was 18, when my mom came home from Iraq. \n\nShe started hanging out with a \u201cfriend\u201d and it was obvious pretty fast that she was happier than we had ever known her to be. \n\nMy brother came to me and said we had to tell her we knew and it didn\u2019t matter to us. So, we took her out to eat, and my brother blurted out. \n\n\u201cLook mom we know you\u2019re gay, and it\u2019s ok. You know we will always love you no matter what.\u201d\n\nShe cried because she was so scared that because she raised us in the Mormon church that we would turn our backs on her.",

            "I'll give you the same advice I'd give any family member who knows but hasn't been told: tell your loved one you love them, tell them you want them to be happy, and tell them you're ready to talk about anything they want to talk about, whenever they're ready. She may not be ready to discuss it with you yet. I think the kindest thing to do is give her loving space.",
            "I would go with something like \u201cHey mom, you know I\u2019d be okay if you started dating right? And you know if be okay if you dated women too right? Just making sure you know\u201d. And then give her a bit to work through that herself before she tells her.",

            "OMG MY TIME TO SHINE. Similar dad leaves mom doesn\u2019t date but she\u2019s rad and then I started noticing some stuff. I was around your age when this happened too. My mom is pretty private and I was real obnoxious/immature back then and I kept asking her if she was gay and telling her I totally would love if she was and she\u2019d deny it but I kept asking because it was so obvious to me. Then one day I was helping her with something and I saw a hickey and I wouldn\u2019t let her leave the room until she told me who gave it to her (spoilers: a woman) and I was TRIUMPHANT and told her how happy for her I was and I was jumping up and down all excited. \n\nI don\u2019t recommend doing any of the above, it definitely made her uncomfortable in hindsight. So don\u2019t be me. \n\nIf you\u2019re feeling direct you can just sit her down and ask her about it/tell her you know -politely! Or just subtly hint that you\u2019re cool with it like other redditors have commented. \n\nBut anyway, congrats on your wlw mom, and sorry for the word vomit it\u2019s not often I have life experience to share online!",
            "Please don't tell her you know she has a girlfriend, and don't mention the web search you found - it'll mortifiy her. \n\nSomething along the lines of telling her \"I love how happy you've been recently, you know you can tell me anything\"\n\nLet her come out when she wants to, but let her know it's okay to do so.",
            "Tell her how much you love her. You also appreciate how she accepts you and your choices. Also that you reciprocate that back to her.",
            "Just let your mom live her life. She will tell you what she wants you to know in her own time. Don\u2019t be trying to push shit that isn\u2019t your business.",
            "Don't do anything.  Just let your mother be herself.  If she doesn't want to say anything, then that is fine.  There is a chance that if you pry, your mother could be offended, she could take this as an invasion of privacy and become defensive, deny the relationship and be closeted.\n\nI know this because I have seen someone I know react this way when people acknowledged their implied interest in the same sex (women).",
            "I don't think there's anything wrong with a straight and to the point \"Mom, are you and Kim dating?\"",
            "I wouldn\u2019t want my mom/dad telling me they know the boy I am with is my romantic and/or sexual partner. I am a very discreet person and they know that. When my dad brings in a new woman friend I don\u2019t go out and tell him \u201cI know you are interested in this woman\u201d. It\u2019s just rude to me. My parents and I both know this without having to speak it out loud. \n\nThis is just me and my family. I obviously don\u2019t know you or your mom but my point is that you should consider your mother\u2019s wishes and comfort level with discussing these things. Maybe you could just let her know you support her without having to make her admit it. Let her express herself when and if she wants to on her own terms.",
            "You don't know that she is dating Kim. And you don't know that she is hiding this relationship. She simply hasn't told you about it. And there are quite a few reasons why that is.\n\n\nI think it's best to respect your mother's privacy and not mention anything. You don't know anything for sure and she didn't share the information with you freely. She will let you know if and when she is ready to do so. Until then, just forget what you saw and carry on as normal.",

She's much better for you than dad.\" Then casually move the conversation along to something else like it's no big deal what you just said/knowledge you revealed and you're just talking about simple stuff.\"",
            "If you want to be subtle, next time Kim comes over for dinner, \u201cKim you\u2019re the best I wish you were here all the time\u201d stuff like that. It\u2019s possible she\u2019s not hiding that she\u2019s dating a woman, just that she\u2019s dating after your dad.",
            "You don't have to say anything.",
            "Next time you are doing something together, or even planning dinner at home just say \"is your girlfriend coming?\" With a shit eating grin on your face.",
            "If it was me, I have a sarcastic blunt humor. I would just one day say \"hey mom are you and Karen dating?\" And by her reaction I would go with whatever she gave me\n\nI am a lesbian who came out at 33 years old (I am now 37). If your mom is anything like me, I bet she would be relieved to not have to hide it from you anymore. \n\nYou don't have to mention the computer stuff, just joke how they seem so couple ish you had to ask or something. \n\nEven say how cool it would be if they were dating? \n\nAnything to break the ice.",
            "Why do you feel a need to do that? \n\nYour mom deserves some privacy around her romantic relationship(s).\n\nIf it was the other way around, would you want her to out you when you wanted it private?    \n\nPlease be decent to your mom.",
            "Tell your mom that you have been thinking about your mom possibly dating and that no matter who she dates, as long as it makes her happy then you will be happy and that she doesn\u2019t have to worry about upsetting you. Let her know you love her and want her to be happy whether she\u2019s single or not.",
            "It actually may be harder for your mom to come out. Different generation, different time, etc.\n\nI would read up on the kid advice and use that. Don't force the issue. Let her get there on her own.",
            "My mom had her own 'best friend' when I was your age! She told me she had a boyfriend and that she wasn't ready for him to meet me yet. I found out by accident that her best friend was actually her girlfriend. The night that I found out, I wrote her a really long letter and put it on the driver's side seat in her car. In the note I told her that she didn't have to be afraid to tell me, that I loved her no matter what, and that I was overjoyed that she could finally find happiness after my dad died. I told her that I was happy that she could truly be herself. \n\nI remember being unable to sleep all night and how my heart pounded when I heard her get in her car to go to work. She called me on her lunch break and we just cried together. Everything changed for the better after that. Her partner and I miss her every day.",
            "Why is there a need to tell her what you believe to be true? I\u2019m curious. Is there anything to gain in doing that? Does this have to be told to her? I don\u2019t see many comments exploring the option of just waiting, and let your mother come to you about this",
            "Just don't. Mind your business.",
            "\"Hey mom, if I told you I was a lesbian, would you still love me?\"\n\nAnd she'd probably say yes, of course. Why?\n\n\"I feel the same way towards you, so why hide it?\"",
            "Don't be confrontational and don't come right out and say \"I know x is going on and its ok.\" Just drop subtle hints that let her know you love and accept her but that still allow her to keep things under wraps if she chooses. Its best to let people come out on their own terms and not feel forced to share that part of themselves if they aren't yet comfortable enough to share it",
            "No need to say anything. Wear a gay pride something.",
            "I wonder if you aren\u2019t the reason she is closeted. How would other family members react? It may be that she comes out to you eventually but need you to keep her secret still. If you do let her know that you know, please assure her that the information is safe with you until she is ready to be out.",
            "Just continue to give her lots of hugs and tell her that you have noticed that she seems happier lately, and whatever the reason, it makes you happy as well. It\u2019s her secret to keep or to share. Just continue to love her unconditionally.",
            "Hey mom come sit and talk with me. Now you\u2019re getting to an age where you\u2019re experimenting with people and I just want you to know I\u2019m here if you need advice and I don\u2019t care which waves you ride so long as you don\u2019t drown.",
            "I was 37 when I came out and it made so much make sense in my life but if a 17 year old who had little life experience had come up and gone \u2018well done\u2019 or assumed I was in fact a lesbian when I was bisexual, I would have had to really take a deep breath not to lose my shit.\n\nYou snooped her search history, jumped to conclusions, are using lesbian joke stereotypes and gross phrases even laughingly. Rug munching is a derogatory term based in the kind of homophobia your mom and I grew up in to say \u2018women with women are freaks.\u2019 It\u2019s why it is never used for men going down on women. The fact you\u2019re acting like lesbian LOLs 101 that your mum might be dating or interested in dating Kim or another woman is something your older, more experienced mom senses and you currently aren\u2019t someone who feels super safe for her to come out to. You are tokenizing it by your lack of discretion with the search history and sounds like you would be the \u2018my gay mom is sooo cool\u2019 teen to others.\n\nYou are Jean Milburn to Otis in Sex Education and you see how well that goes. But that making it about your response and overdoing it is very very hard for people who come out late because it objectifies them. It is hugely stigmatised. I lost ALL my friends from my past, people I had know 20+ years including gay friends. My family went batshit. The deep homophobia of that time lingers for those who grew up in it and then if you come out late, many LGBTQ+ people see you as a lipstick lesbian, not enough etc. It\u2019s a tough balance.\n\nSo you outing your mum by having seen something private and making it a big deal is just crashingly wrong here and would be for a parent too. There isn\u2019t a tonne of info about parents coming out to teens unless they are remarrying because trust me most people at that age realise telling a teen is going to be difficult, make it about the teen and open a whole can of worms because teens are usually still struggling to see their parents as independent sexual beings. It\u2019s advised that you process coming out which is like a second adolescence before you tell a teen as otherwise you clash as two people both in the some of the same \u2018who am I?\u2019 stages that lead to boundary stomping etc.\n\nAlso just don\u2019t out people. It is a universal rule. Don\u2019t do that to your mum like an ambush. It shatters trust. It can be so profound it can damage parent child relationships both ways. Model how you would want your mom to treat you.\n\nAlso last reason I suggest you keep quiet: those Google searches are common if like me you are a queer poly/open kinky person who is looking how to have multiple partners or orgies or sex parties safely such when to glove, which toys can be made safe to share. You may well think you are having a mini Pride only to discover a whole side of your mom you really need never know and shouldn\u2019t. That is as personal and discreet as your sex life should be to your mum. Good fences make good neighbours.\n\nYou could probably help be a little safer if she is coming out by knowing some LGBTQ+ history from all age groups and just ask LGBTQ+ people not a primarily cishet sub. Go read r/bisexual or wherever and listen. Coming out is safest with people who listen not just react. You\u2019re 17, you are well meaning and your love and excitement for your mom is clear but you\u2019ll benefit from understanding it better generally as we queers are everywhere, popping up at all times and ages :)\n\nGood luck but don\u2019t assume!",

            "Until I read your whole post, I would've said yes- not just because I frickin LOVE therapy and couples counseling, but because even if you're all the way checked out, it can help the separation go more smoothly. Better communication helps everyone, all the time, even couples who no longer want/can no longer be couples. \n\nHOWEVER your husband is emotionally manipulative and potentially verbally abusive. Going to counseling together will only allow him to see how to talk to you about your insecurities, flaws, etc in a more personal and damaging way. Tell him you're no longer interested in couples counseling but you'd love to see him get some personal therapy. You tried to get him to go for a lot of years and his past unwillingness shows you that you'll need to see change from him first- if he refuses, that says a lot about his desire to change for you. If he agrees, then awesome, maybe he'll figure something out and be a better dad in the future, since he's the only father your children have. Then, when you're prepped for everything and your child has moved out for college and you're comfortable and ready, hand him some divorce papers. Get a good mediator for the divorce, or just lawyer up in you think there's even the slightest chance he'll get toxic or try to use your kids or past or possessions to hurt you. \n\nLastly, talk to your kids. You dont need to throw their dad under the bus, but you can say Hey, I know we're all aware of how your father reacts to perceived failures or lack of accomplishments. Its long been an issue between us and I planned to divorce him years ago, but when we tried again and it stopped working again, I decided to stick around because I wanted to keep the family as stable as possible for you. I'm not blaming you, I'm very personally happy with my decision and don't feel like I've wasted or lost time at all- but I'm telling you now because A) we're getting divorced and its my choice, and B) your father tries, but regularly doesn't live up to my expectations for how to talk to you guys. If I'm not there, he won't have someone to temper those words. Please don't allow those words to bring you down, now or ever.\n\nObviously that's just what I'd say, but basically, get out there and live your life. You're still young, you're successful, you've raised good kids and you deserve to be happy and be treated well all the time.",

            "This was so strange to weird; are you my mom? Just kidding- but seriously. My parents were together for 30+ years, and because my mom wanted to keep me and my brother from having to live with a split family, she endured the abuse; financial, emotional, not ever physical but enough to make anyone lose it. But the abuse extended to us kids too. I've not lived with them in over a decade and I am still dealing with the dynamics of that household. \n\nWhenever my mom would entertain thoughts of leaving, my dad would beg and promise everything under the sun. Counseling, change in behavior, respecting her instead of constantly putting her down and making her feel intellectually inferior (though she was the one with a college education). \n\nMy mom had threatened divorce multiple times, and decided to finally go through with it last year. Some part of her finally clicked and understood what we kids had been trying to tell her for years; he was never going to change. He had over 20 years to do so, and he's only going to promise to change because he'll trap you into staying, and thinks you'll get complacent with the abuse. \n\nI understand wanting to try because it is something you know, and the world can be scary alone when you've been with someone all this time. But believe me when I say my mom is happier than she's ever been. She honestly was so shocked that she could even feel this good about herself after she went through with the divorce.\n\nAll this long rant was just to come around and ask yourself earnestly, because after 25+ years you are well aware of the person your husband is; do you believe he will honestly put in the work, or is he just saying these things to keep you around? Also would you be able to combat a lifetime of abuse from your partner, and forgive the way he treated you and your family enough to move forward if he just suddenly decided he can change and be better? \n\nGood luck moving forward with whatever you choose, and please take care of yourself and your kids.",

Ripping the band-aid off completely is better than re-opening the wound every day for 10+ years thinking that a new band-aid is going to make it go away. If anything it just leaves an even bigger emotional scar that can take a lot of therapy to deal with, if it's even fixable.

He's freaking out, because it's dawned on him he'll have no one in his life.

More than one person on Reddit has chosen to distance themselves and their kids from both parents when one of the parents is abusive and the other one stays and enables the abuser.\n\nThat may not happen to you, but again it just might.

He\u2019s laid hands on me once before, and mom admitted that it wasn\u2019t just the one time I\u2019d previously known about- he\u2019d hit, punched or beat her 5 times altogether. Some while my sister and I were little. \n\nI pressed her, as I have many times now, why she hadn\u2019t left him years ago. She finally admitted that it was because of my sister and I. \n\nFat lot of good that did, as both my sister and I bare psychological scars from him. He\u2019s alienated 3 of his kids and is likely to die sooner than later from either cancer, high blood pressure, or just generally being a jackass. \n\nMy point here is that I wish women would stop staying with their abusive, manipulative husbands \u201cfor the children\u201d. Often, that is what does more harm. \n\nLeave him now.",
            "I grew up with a father who treated me and my siblings this exact same way. We are all grown up now and NOT okay. A visitation arrangement is far less mentally damaging than being trapped with an abusive father.",
            "I'd say no to counseling. You stayed for your kids but now you can pursue happiness on your own terms and your husband can live with his miserable self. I mean your kids are young adults now if you leave ur husband I can most certainly say your colleged age kids won't be visiting him anymore.",
            "There\u2019s too many comments to read but I grew up in a house like yours.  Even though my dad was the asshole and made me cry and all the things you mention he\u2019s made your kids experience, I have more hurt from what I view as the ultimate betrayal from my mom.   Yes she was the comforting and not mean parent, but she didn\u2019t stand up for us or for herself and I don\u2019t think I can ever forgive her.   I would have had way more respect and a relationship with her today if she stood up for herself and for us kids at any point.  Even in my adult life I kept hope she\u2019d see how terrible he was to all of us and even offered her a way out financially, which you say is not an issue for you. We were kids.  He made us cry.  I hate him.  I\u2019m 41 and am very low contact.  You have to do what is best for you, but from the perspective of a child in this situation I lost my mom to succumbing to my dad.",

Counseling is a good thing for anyone, and it certainly would be worth going to a counselor for yourself, regardless of what he will or will not do.\n\nMy mother stayed in a similar marriage and regrets not divorcing him sooner (she was going to when I was 12 but waited til I was 20 - but younger sis was 9.  My father was always negative and never changed.  Our lack of  relationship was highlighted by their divorce.  I reconnected with him briefly when I was older, only to see he had not changed and would not change - and it was toxic to be around someone so negative.  I have nothing to do with him now.\n\nI am divorced from a toxic woman, but it has allowed me to be an even better parent for my kids (now 15 and 17).  We are very close, and we will continue to be that way.  Counseling help me and I focused on improving myself for my sake and the sake of my kids.\n\nIn the end, you know your heart and mind do not feel like they used to for him.

Worst case scenario is you get nothing out of it and your back where you started. But if you decide to go to marriage counselling he should absolutely know that this is his last chance and that it\u2019s not a guarantee you will stay and that he has to be putting in 100 percent effort. I would also make it a stipulation that he has to go to individual therapy and if possible you as well. \n\nAll that being said if he is an abuser do not go like the others said. I would suggest that you seek out therapy for yourself. Don\u2019t go for his benefit. It\u2019s time you do what\u2019s best for you and no one else. If your gut feeling is that it\u2019s a ploy then you are right. You know this man better than us. Best of luck during this tough time.",

I have a wonderful mom I'd like to see more of, but I don't visit often because I can't really stand her choice of a husband. I think he's disrespectful to her, too, but they're far too old and used to their lives to change anything.\n\nI've met wonderful 50+ women, dating guys and enjoying their lives and living for themselves (finally!). I was so happy for them. I am much younger and I decided I want to be that awesome when I'm their age. Be it alone or together with somebody.\n\nYou don't owe your husband any of your life. Honestly, from what you've written, it looks like you really don't want to go to therapy with him and drag this on any longer, but feel a bit guilty for not giving him another chance and thus looking for validation online. Listen to yourself. If you really don't feel like this is what you want and aren't prepared to work hard to keep the relationship together, it will undoubtedly fail. Good luck!",

Not sure what advice I would give but I can tell you what happened to my aunt's family.\n\nThanks to all the years that my uncle was emotionally abusive and controlling, all of their kids (2 sons and 2 daughters) all moved far away. They all got married and have kids of their own, and rarely ever see their parents. My aunt has to travel far to see her grand kids and the husband refuses to ever go. She resents him like crazy because even though he's an okay husband, he's permanently placed a wedge between them and their kids.",
            "Dr. Phil always said that it is better to be from a broken home than raised in one. I know you can't turn back the clock and save your kids from being abused by him. I think your kids will be able to forgive you for that because you did defend and stand up for them. But please, enough is enough with him.\n\n If you decide to end it, and you absolutely should - PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't have any expectations for your kids relationship with him. Be neutral in your reaction and supportive of whatever type of relationship they choose to have with him. If they choose to never speak to him again, let them come to that choice by themselves. Don't put pressure on them to speak to him or spend time with him. Whatever you do, don't ever say \"but he's your father\". Be the most loving and supportive mom you can, as a single parent. \n\nIt will be a tough road but I think you owe it to yourself, you don't owe that man another day of your life. Just get a lawyer and discuss, honestly, all of your wants from a divorce and ask for advice from them on the best way to approach this incredibly manipulative man SAFELY. I really can't stress safety enough. If you think he's going to fly off the handle, maybe consider having him served after removing any possessions, slowly, that you absolutely don't want to loose (pictures, jewelry, money, momentos)and make sure you're in a safe place and your kids know what is happening so that they can prepare how to respond when he inevitably reaches out to them and tries to manipulate them to his \"side\".\n\nGood luck, really, I hope that your future is full of happiness and you don't spend another moment miserable with a man who only loves himself and his bank account.",

            "Growing up in an emotionally abusive home is mentally damaging in itself, usually much more mentally damaging than visitation arrangements. The wounds aren't always obvious, but they're there, and they show up in all kinds of ways, especially in their attachment patterns towards their future loved ones, their relationship with authority, and their self esteem and self compassion. \n\nSo encourage your kids to get therapy, sooner rather than later, it's always better to start the work early in life, although it can be done at any age.\n\nAnyway. For you I recommend checking out the book \"Why does he do that?\" by Lundy Bancroft. You can find it free online (with author's permission so it's not stealing). It will most probably speak to you, and answer many of your questions. \n\nAs for the councelling part; that's most likely a ploy to get you to stay when he knows the kids won't keep you anymore.\n\nGood luck!",
            "\"I was afraid that having them in a visitation arrangement would be meantally damaging to them.\" \n\nSounds like it would have been better had you left because you wrote both of your children are \"well adjusted, bright, motivated and loving\", yet you also stated your oldest has been made to feel like a disappointment to his father and \"both of your children broken down crying at times of his treatment towards them\".\n\nIMO, I would run.  This is such am unhealthy environment and if you say you are a \"successful, financially, independent person\", why would you stay? \n\nSearch in your heart and I'm sure you will find the answer you are looking for.\n\nGood luck.",

            "This sounds like my parents. Their relationship was emotionally abusive for my entire childhood, they genuinely believed they had protected me from it (they didn\u2019t) and they waited until I was out of the house to split up. They thought they were maintaining my home - I saw it as they were using me as a buffer and once I was gone, they couldn\u2019t maintain it anymore. It took A LOT of therapy and tough conversations to get us back to a good place.\n\nThis is all to say - reconciliation takes work, humility and empathy. Does your husband have those qualities/is he willing to develop them? Are you both aware of the potential damage that he has done to your children and have you considered what life will be like with him without any buffers? Is this someone you are happy to spend everyday with, just the two of you? \n\nIf any of that is filling you with dread - you know your answer.\n\nAlso - the very cynical part of me says that he knows that there is now nothing holding you to the relationship (you\u2019re financially viable, kids aren\u2019t home etc) and this is an attempt to keep you. Might be worth thinking about that.",
            "you didn't want to leave before due to the fact  you thought it would be mentally  damaging to the kids????  So instead you stayed any had them subjected to  his hurtful treatment instead?\n\nOnly you can decide if you want to give it a go with him  with counseling.  Only you know your feelings towards him",
            "First, the notion to stay in an unchanging problematic relationship \u2019for the kids\u2019 is usually not a good idea. They know that the relationship isn\u2019t healthy. They see how he treats you regardless of how well you think you hide it and that definitely gives a skewed idea of how relationships should be, whether the emulate that same type of relationship or try to over compensate by doing the \u201copposite\u201d. \nBut you can\u2019t do anything about that now. I do suggest encouraging your kids to also head to some type of therapy. \nSecond, why would you want to do counseling with him? He\u2019s proven for years that he didn\u2019t care enough to try and could only adjust his behavior to manipulate you into staying. Why would you allow that to happen again?",

He will say or do whatever to get you to stay, but he had a lifetime to show you you're worth fighting for, that he will work on improving himself so you no longer bear the burden of his issues which he neglects or ignores. You stayed with him when he didn't work on self improvement, and when he mentally abuses the kids that you have sacrificed your own life and well being for. He knows keeping up a temporary\nappearances will work. It's worked for this long. He thinks it's that easy to get you to stay since you've never followed through with the threat, and even now you're doubting what you've known for so long due to his backless claims.\n\nLeave and the life you've been wanting to live. Separate, for a year at least. Sometimes even that first break , life feels right and when you're out it that spell/curse you never want to go back to suffocating under a partners neglected baggage . Having time away from each other for you to both think about your own needs will only help, and he really really needs to see and feel consequences for his actions and shit behavior.\n\nTrust your gut!!! You're doubting your insight when it's always telling us the truth! \n\n\nTldr for below:  hubbs description is brief but everything matched my dad's completely, although mine has a shit ton more horrible attributes. May have had a profound affect on your kids that could still affect them today, might be helpful to check in about it if you haven't discussed it in depth with them ? The separation could be driving force in your decision and a good leeway to get into the hidden pain they may be hiding as to not hurt you.\n\nI really wished my mom had divorced my dad. He sounds similar to my dad and I'm not sure what the extent of your hubbs looks like, but I struggled so hard during adolescence and felt I even bloomed later because my dads abuse and my mom keeping us under his roof kept pushing me off track from normal development. She constantly threatened to leave him but Old school koreans won't divorce so unhealthy relationships are normal to me. I do therapy and a lot of self work but staying with abusive people often causes more damage than having to joint custody in 2 homes. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if she stuck around for the same reasons as you, sacrificing herself for her kids..she is still with him and he's even more abusive, my dad's longest friend even cut him out finally due to how openly abusive he is to her even in public and , and got fed up with him going over board about pro trump conspiracies and being openly racist and misogynistic. \n\nHopefully your kids never felt like this but I'd hope they'd tell you if they did. Reiterations of unworthiness and lack of value that make you break down especially during formative years,. seems unlikely that they came out unscathed. Definitely check in with them in an openly acceptive, not accusatory way,  to see if they're drinking or drugging cuz abuse like that can relieve those feelings of inadequacy that plague them. Coming from a place of care , not criticism or concern (easier to brush aside mom concern \ud83d\ude1c)\n\n\nOr they're like me and never ever would want to make their mom feel hurt or shame. Id never come out and say this to my mom. Maybe it would be healing but idk she has suffered so much in life and Is seriously the most wonderful, interesting, loving person.  She has her reasons, had tons of truama growing up in war torn korea. It broke my heart when on our last family Vaca in 2015 , mom and i stepped out onto the porch while my dad was raging out inside and she goes,\n\n\"Your daddy jerk.

All of a sudden, when I was ready to leave, he was open to doing everything.\n\nIt was too little, too late. We divorced fairly quickly and moved on quickly to new partners. I have two kiddos now with my husband and the ex has since moved on and adopted (go figure, he was the fertility issue, after years of blaming it on me and Dr. Google diagnosing me with PCOS among other things). It was clearly for the best, we are both matched up with people who better align with ourselves (or so I assume).\n\nI actually wish I had of been stronger and more independent and left sooner, but it took some courage and probably 6 months of planning as I was financially dependent on him.

You know more than a bunch of randoms on Reddit about this guy and any hope for reconciliation. What\u2019s the downside to counseling? Just the expense? Is there anything worth salvaging in this marriage? Would the prospect of losing you and the marriage make him willing to look at his controlling behaviors and try to change? Is it worth giving him the chance.? Maybe not. But ask yourself why so many people here advise you to ditch him.  Are they angry about their own circumstances or hurts? Almost certainly yes.

You\u2019ll need to be in each other\u2019s lives to some degree, and he\u2019ll still be in your kids lives.  You haven\u2019t said anything redeeming about your husband here, so it\u2019s hard to imagine why you would stay. After 25 years, it seems worth it, even to close this chapter well.",
            "Always agree to counselling! There\u2019s a misconception that the role of a marriage counsellor is to fight to keep the marriage together at all costs. Not true - a good and experienced (and impartial) counsellor has the job of helping clients clarify their situation, determine their goals, and work towards a suitable and acceptable outcome. If you\u2019ve already given up on the marriage, your counsellor will help you determine if that\u2019s a good choice for you, and if so, they serve as a mediator to help your husband see your point of view, and hopefully advise you both in how to progress with the minimum of destruction. \n\nMy current partner had the same thing with her ex-husband - counselling was always off the table until it was evident to him that she was leaving. The counsellor took time to understand the situation and saw that this was not a marriage to fight to save if one of the two parties was that unhappy.",
            "You might be interested to know that marital satisfaction hits its lowest point just before the last child moves out of the home, and then springs up significantly after they leave. In my case, I gave myself about a year after my kids left and after a year later I was sure that I didn\u2019t wanna do it anymore and got a divorce. I\u2019m glad I spent the time giving it a try poster child so that I knew that that wasn\u2019t going to work. And in my case, it was their step child in my actual child, and that was not really surmountable.",
            "Wow. You ask complete strangers for a life decision. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s losing a winner.",
            "Try it. See if he commits. Having a kid around is a different dynamic, and it\u2019s about to be just the two of you. Maybe the combo of that and counseling could make things materially better. Maybe not. However, trying to make that decision in advance, at this point, seems like throwing the baby out with the bath water. You have been there through this much, see if the trajectory can change. Rebuilding anew with someone else is infinitely possible, but it\u2019s a big leap, so make sure you want to jump.",
            "I think you should take him up on the offer to go to counseling. After so many years, you have a life with this other human being. Might as well give it a shot... it might be the one step that will take you in the right direction. Especially since you don't think he's all that bad. A little guidance from a third party won't hurt.",
            "What\u2019s the downside in trying?",
            "Against the grain here but I'd give him one last shot. What's another few weeks to see if he can get it together after so many years? If you do decide it's not going to work out you'll both have more warning and closure.",
            "Whether you leave or not, you should still attend counseling with him because he is the father of your kids and needs to see and treat those underlying things that affected their relationship. You don\u2019t have to stay because of the kids, but I think it would be helpful for you to give the counselor insight. It may help him repair some of the damage.",
            "Don't take relationship advice from the people on the internet. Seems to all be confirmation bias and nothing you should actually hear.",
            "I'd like to hear his side of it. Go to counseling before you throw something away. Everyone can always benefit from hearing hard truths about themselves from a licensed professional. Might put things in necessary perspective.",
            "You might disagree with me and I am not sure how he treats you, but if he does so with love, but carry some flaws like being verbally abusive with your kid or you at times, I feel this relationship is worth keeping. \n\nLeaving the relationship would certainly hurt him as well and my take is that if you do love him enough, you wouldn\u2019t think of how to benefit yourself but how you can care for him. \n\n\u201cPerfect acceptance of imperfections\u201d is vital in any relationship, so if you\u2019re going to leave a man that loves you for some of his flaws, I\u2019d say that\u2019s a very cruel gesture because it shows that you never really did love him. \n\nGive him a go at counselling, you might say that he\u2019s saying this only because he fears losing you but think about it, he fears losing you because you mean something to him. \n\nIt would be sad to see that simply because you\u2019re well off on your own that you deserve better. Indeed you do, but spare a thought for those who have been there for you, cared for you, despite in ways that you might not like.",

            "All I can share with you is that I am 2 years out of a 25 year marriage to an abusive and controlling man.  I know that I made the right decision in leaving, but I have to tell you that I am so lonely.  I have always had a man in my life and now I don't even have the illusion of having a partner.  I have realized that I never did have a partner, but I don't like being alone.  It's another Saturday night and I'm going to have dinner alone, watch tv alone, and sleep alone.  You may have a different outcome if you leave, but there are many women who are sitting in the same seat as me.  Good luck to you.",
            "This sounds like a typical pre-divorce rant, I'm sure his version of the story would have you in an equally villainous role.\n\nGo for counseling, don't listen to reddit.",
            "Yes, always give it a try when the alternative is a broken home. You have waited too long to not go. Give it a try.",
            "To me it sounds like he is trying when it is too late.  You need to think about what will make you most happy in life.",
            "Honestly, the best thing you can do might just be to leave.  People can nod and smile all they want in therapy or whatever, but if there are no consequences to behavior, no consequences to ineffective coping mechanisms, no consequences to harmful thought patterns, etc, then the behaviors will not change.  You leaving will be a consequence.  That might be what prompts a change.",
            "do not waste one more second with this person. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhow many more days you think you have left? you want to spend them with someone who has spent years proving the person that they are?",
            "I feel like at least some sort of break and a sense of uncomfortableness for a certain amount of time for him will either make or break the situation for what it really is and for what it has been. If you leave he\u2019s gonna either do what it do right or he\u2019s gonna quickly show signs of giving up because it\u2019s too much work to fake it. But the choice is yours and you have absolutely every right to wait no longer and make the decision now because yes 25 years is a long ass time \nto not work as a team and be in a so called marriage that\u2019s rude actually. I think stepping back from the situation just a little bit for at least some time can help you sort your final emotions of this long relationship to oh ok am I done. Or, no I want to help him be who he can be to me and risk the same outcome. Or he could do a whole 360. What I do know is following your gut feeling will help you make your decision. Just an outsiders point of view, good luck OP!",
            "I would say it's worth a shot if it's something you want. Counselors won't take sides and will try to help you both help yourselves. But ultimately you know you best and you should follow what your gut tells you",

            "Hey, OP, I used to do the same thing with my parents, and later with several boyfriends. It's definitely called \"dissociation\" and it's a normal thing that your brain does to protect itself during traumatic events. It doesn't mean you're autistic, different, or broken in any way; it just means that your parents are awful, shitty people. I'm so sorry.\n\nUnfortunately, there's not much you can do at all about this. You've probably said to yourself something like, \"next time I'll do *xyz thing* instead of freezing up and zoning out,\" right? After getting screamed at, I always tried to think of something else I could do or say the next time, but almost always ended up disassociating again instead. And the truth is that your parents, in that moment, are already targeting you with abuse, so they may pick apart or scream at you for *anything* you'd do in those situations. At least retreating into your head is predictable for everyone involved, and easy to do, so that's why your brain does it. It's okay.\n\nAt 17, you could try to become emancipated, but it may take longer than just waiting for your 18th birthday, depending on how far away that is, and honestly it's a pretty difficult legal battle. Your best bet is to try to just hold onto your sanity however you best can until you're 18, and then leave as soon as you can. If there's a friend's family who would take you in, I'd recommend reaching out to them. Finish school however you can, do well in your studies, and apply for as many scholarships and grants as you can if you want to go to college after high school. If you can't or don't want to go to college, that's okay too; you'll find a job, and there are resources out there in your state to help you get on your feet (medicaid, food stamps, section 8 housing, Planned Parenthood can help get you on birth control, etc) if your income is low.\n\nWhen you leave, bring all of your important documents: photo ID or driver's license, passport if you have one, birth certificate, and social security card. You'll need your ID and soc card (or birth certificate) for onboarding at any new job, and the others are *yours* and will help you replace anything you might lose. Keep them in a safe place that nobody else can get to, and that can't be lost or stolen (don't keep them all in your wallet or car!). If you have a bank account and your parents are listed on it, you should make a new account at a completely separate banking institution once you turn 18, and don't tell them about it if you think they'll try to access your money. Move your money from the old account to the new account without telling them.\n\nI've been where you are. I'm 32 now. It gets better. Your situation will get better too. Just remember that this isn't forever, and that you'll be able to get out of there at some point. And please reach out to someone you trust for support in the meantime! If I can help at all or if you want to talk, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm here and not going anywhere.\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for the silver (edit2: and other awards, omg what?!)! I really appreciate it, but my main focus is on OP. Does anyone know of any trauma resources she might be able to access for free online, or other ways to help her without alerting her parents?",
            ">I know that sounds super weird\n\nIt's a very common coping method for abusive situations. \n\nDo you have a plan for getting out of their house? How soon are you 18?",
            "I think this would qualify as dissociation.\n\nIt's very common to dissociate when in abusive and stressful situations.\n\nEven though their verbal violence isn't necessarily directed at you, simple being subjected to that type of turbulence causes trauma. And the fact that they turn on you and abuse you by calling you a \"vegetable\" and \"autistic\" when you don't act like their behavior is acceptable demonstrates that they don't like having to think that their behavior might be wrong. You dissociating puts a limelight on how damaging their behavior is toward you and that's probably why they react so negatively to it. They'd rather you go skipping along putting on a face like everything's normal rather than have to acknowledge the damage their constant arguing has done to you.\n\nLoads of people have to deal with a lifetime of therapy because they were constant witnesses of fights between their parents and it leaves mental scars.\n\nI'm sorry, OP. I really don't have an answer for your problem here. I imagine that attempting to talk rationally with your parents about why it's not okay for them to subject you to their constant yelling, is futile given the way they're behaving whenever you shut down. \n\nI would probably do my best to avoid being around them when they start arguing and start preparing financially to move out as soon as you are 18 and the COVID-19 situation has ended.",
            "Please contact a teacher or counselor or social worker in your school. You are experiencing abuse. You are exerting a severe and potentially dangerous reaction to that abuse. You are a minor and therefore are able to access services that would be more difficult for someone who is 18. Do this NOW.",
            "You are dissociating and it is a common response to trauma, as other commenters have said. It's what your mind has to do to cope with the abuse. I hope you can get out of that household, because it's unsafe for you. If you can stay anywhere else, leave.",
            "That's disassociation and maybe depersonalization.  It doesn't lead anywhere good.  Similar situation tbh 20 years ago.   Never got therapy.  I ended up just killing off my emotions and ego.  Operated like a robot for years.  A bit different now but I feel like my ability to deal with emotions is hella stunted because I shut them off for over a decade. Some emotions are still gone.",
            "Do you have any other relatives with whom you can live?",
            "You\u2019re experiencing dissociation.\n\nYou should make a plan for a) getting out of that house and b) getting counseling for what might be some PTSD symptoms here. \n\nYou\u2019re going to be fine, but it\u2019ll take some time and effort.",
            "That feeling is called dissociation btw, it's a common reaction to emotional trauma or stress. So.. yeah. Sadly your parents suck. I'm sorry I don't have good advice other than move out as early as you can.",
            "It sounds like they've done a number on your psyche, and that zoning out is your way of coping with that. When you move out, you'll probably look back and realize just how awful this environment really is. I would suggest that you start making a plan to move out asap when you can, and get into some form of therapy for the years of damage this has inevitably caused.",
            "Agree with others, sounds like dissociation and it's pretty common in abusive situations. I highly, highly recommend getting out of there as quickly as possible. I grew up in an abusive household and found myself doing similar things to cope. Now I'm living a dream life (awesome job, good apartment, decent physical health, perfect boyfriend) and I find I sometimes can't stop dissociating during precious moments... granted, I'm bipolar and that's part of bipolar, but developing bipolar and coming from an abusive household are very related things. It sucks so much. So, basically, don't feel like a freak but get out of there before your brain forms this as a habit and/or develops a lifelong disorder.\n\nEdit: I've felt so frustrated at my brain and guilty about these kinds of behaviors in my adult self. I understood it a lot better when my therapist said something like \"your brain is doing its best to help you out. It's doing what it has learned. Unfortunately, it did most of its learning while you were young, in highly stressful environments where having intense emotional reactions, or none at all, would be the appropriate response for keeping you safe. Unfortunately, your brain is sticking to this and making you dissociate during concerts, or cry from simple, harmless statements. But it really is your brain trying its best with what it has learned\" - please don't teach your brain that this is what life is like for any longer than necessary, get out of that situation asap. Best of luck.",
            "I don't have a lot of practical advice but maybe some light at the end of the tunnel. Your post hurt my heart because I was known as a 'space cadet' but my very aggressive family growing up. There was a lot of yelling in my family. \n\nWhat I can tell you is, at 31 I no longer have this problem. I've left home, gotten an education and started my own career which gives me enough to afford my own simple apartment. My life is peaceful. I still have a relationship with my parents, but I limit my visits, and they know i\"m not afraid to hang up the phone if they're too harsh. \n\nMy advice to you is to keep going, and get out as soon as you can. You're 17, there's an end to this.",
            "Do you understand that your body is allowing you to leave that scene? The easier thing would be when you hear them start to fight, you get up and physically leave the room, and do not come back. Find something to do anywhere else that is out of earshot of their fight. Take the dog for a walk, walk around the block yourself, put on some headphones and listen to your favourite music.\n\nDo something that physically removes you from their fights. Allow your brain to engage in whatever you were doing, and there will be no need for it to shut down and zone out. I\u2019m sorry to hear that your life is like that, but this will be a great way to be in a better mental place. And, maybe your parents will get the message that you are leaving them to fight their own battles.",
            "You\u2019re dissociating due to trauma. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with that. It\u2019s not your fault! Is there someone you can talk to for help, or a way you can move out?",
            "You are being abused and your parents are in denial about it. They truly believe that you are fine.",
            "I wouldn't stop doing it, in fact I do a version of this when I'm in any stressful situations, but without the dissociated feelings.  Look into some meditation/stress apps like Headspace, they've helped me in times where I can't really physically get away from a stressful period.  But I'm sorry you have to deal with this OP, get out when you can.",
            "Does this happen to you when you argue with anybody else? Or is it just when your parents have this attitude towards you?",
            "You are not weird. You are coping. Keep yourself sane and cope how you need to till you can get out.",
            "That\u2019s disassociation. Good thing you\u2019re already 17. Hopefully you\u2019ll be able to leave there sooner than later. Getting out of their house should help a lot. But don\u2019t be surprised if you end up in a relationship that triggers this same response. I went from chaos, abuse and neglect at home on and off for 18 years and ended up in an unhealthy abusive relationship as an adult for nearly a decade. That was not a coincidence. If you end up in bad relationships once you\u2019re an adult, get some therapy.",
            "This is actually a common way the brain protects itself from trauma and abuse. I do this as well whenever my abusive mother starts yelling at me which is why I can never tell anyone what she says because I don't hear anything, you can ask me the second she stops yelling at me and I will have no idea what she said because I do not hear anything. \n\n\nIt's a hard \"habit\" to break,  1 because habits in general are hard to break and 2 because it's your mind protecting itself from trauma. \n\nIf you feel there's something wrong with you for doing it then don't cause it's normal. Besides them yelling at you and the autistic comments (which obviously I have no idea if you are but just because of this doesn't mean sh!t) which personally wouldn't bother me,  is there something else they do? Cause if you can deal with those two then I wouldn't stop/worry because again this is you protecting yourself from trauma so :/ \n\nAlso I apologize, I'm very bad at explaining things",
            "As others have said, this is how you are coping with an awful situation. Maybe when they are calm, tell them you want to talk to them.... if you think they will listen. \n\nI would tell them, if you can talk to them that is, that you did some research and figured out why you are doing what you do. Their constant fighting is affecting you and hurting you, and you don't know how to cope with it anymore. Also, it's not right that they turn their anger on you. Those two have a choice to stay together or not, whereas you do not. You have nowhere to go and found the only way to cope in the meantime. Tell them that they need to work out their problems a different way and to leave you out of it. Call them out.\n\nThis might lead to them getting angry at you, so keep that in mind. In the meantime, I'd be working on my exit plan. If your parents won't 1. work out their problems or 2. won't split, then the only way to heal from that toxic environment is to get out of it.",
            "Well at least you don't cope with drugs or other shit, so i suggest you keep space out.. till they understand that it's cause of dem behavior :s",
            "I'm the same way, grew up in the same type of household with constant yelling and I just go away in my head.  I think nowadays it has a name and a lot of therapists are aware of it and can help, so if I were young I would first focus on getting out of there cleanly and then on finding a therapist that I trusted to work with.\n\nETA - my parents never noticed the dissociating part, but whenever I come back into my own head my body gives a big shudder and they would make fun of me for that.",

Stay safe\u2665\ufe0f",
            "Well you have one year until you are 18 and what you need to do is plan to leave. Go away for college or start planning becoming financial independent. Dissociating to get away from trauma doesn\u2019t sound too unusual. I\u2019m surprised you can do it on command, but otherwise there isn\u2019t anything wrong about you doing it. Sadly it\u2019s a coping mechanism and perhaps not the healthiest so you might want to see a therapist because while it makes sense to do this with your parents you won\u2019t want to do this when you have conflict with a partner or someone else close to you. You\u2019ll need to confront and speak with them. The good news is that it will be healthy in a way it just isn\u2019t with your parents (which is probably why you do this).

            "Too bad if it makes them mad. If they don't like you doing it maybe they should stop being abusive.

            "This is likely dissociation. It\u2019s a trauma response. It\u2019s a normal thing your brain does for self preservation when it becomes overwhelmed.

            "Look up \"dissociation.\" I've gotten like that in really stressful situations too. It works well for the moment, but I had some complications later on, because I started getting physical symptoms instead of emotions, like insomnia, losing my appetite, and panic attacks. \n\nI was 17 like you when it started. I'm 34 now. I've been in therapy and have medication to help with the panic attacks. It worked well for the situation I was in as a teenager, when I didn't have the option to leave, or react, I didn't want to self medicate with alcohol or drugs. But when I was somewhere safe and didn't need to do it anymore, I couldn't \"turn it off.\"\n\nThere is nothing wrong with what you're doing. It will make them angry, or maybe scared, because I've been around people who do that in a fight, and it's scary to see. You might explain to them that it's how you deal with the stress of them yelling, and you'll stop doing it if they stop yelling \n\nBut in the meantime, just start setting stuff up to leave when you turn 18, if possible.",
            "Not weird at all. Mant people utilse this coping mechanism. Your parents are reaching for another way to control you, or at least how you seem to the outside world. If you're \"autistic\", they can't be responsible for your untoward behavior. Unfortunately for them, Your actions are completely rational and neurotypical, plus  you'll be 18 soon, and legally able to be out on your own. Soon, buckaroo, soon.",
            "This is really bad, OP. I feel for you. Disassociation is no joke. Right now you can control it, but if it becomes a habit or is pervasive, it can cause problems. It\u2019s a symptom of mental illness, and if it\u2019s severe enough it can become a disorder itself. My spouse has a dissociative disorder from a lifetime of some pretty intense shit, and it causes certain... things to happen.\n\nWhen you\u2019re dissociated, your body kind of goes on auto-pilot and your mind isn\u2019t really in control anymore for that moment. In the most severe cases, which comes about if you\u2019re pushed to that altered state a lot, what seems like another personality can form to deal with whatever is going on in that moment. For example, if your parents were consistently violent towards you, and during that dissociated state you had to fight your way out of the situation frequently, you would be conditioned to when violence in that state. You could end up with a violent \u201cpersonality\u201d that comes out when your brain feels threatened. Once you return to your normal mental state, you might not even recall what happened if it\u2019s severe enough.\n \nI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re going to develop multiple personalities... Keep in mind that tends to follow a lifetime of pervasive and extreme abuse where the mind is pushed to the breaking point by extreme fear for its life and the dissociation is involuntary (think survivors of child sex trafficking). So, while you\u2019re unlikely to end up with pure DD (dissociative disorder, a very rare diagnosis) from just the yelling in the home, you\u2019re a lot more prone to PTSD now if you ever experience more abuse or another trauma later in life.\n\nTL;DR your parents are causing symptoms of some pretty extreme mental disorders from their shit. They need to cut it out (unlikely) or you need to get the hell out of there before it becomes a problem. And you should probably think of seeing a counselor or therapist to help with your stress levels.",
            "You started doing this as a coping mechanism for their uncomfortable arguments.\n\nI do the same thing, to a slightly lesser extent. The only thing I can suggest is, when they question it, say that sentence to them. If they won't listen, there is no changing them.",

Your \"unfocused\" moments are how you are escaping from reality and, honestly, it's a really common form of coping in people who are living in unhealthy homes.\n\nDo you have anyone you can reach out to for help? A trusted adult, a school counselor, etc.? These people can offer you love and support if you reach out to them and are honest with them about your situation at home. A counselor may be able to point you toward other resources so that you can learn additional, and perhaps healthier, means of coping through hard times.\n\nBeing a teenager is rough. Being a teen in an unhealthy home, is the worst. I'm sorry you're going through this. Please seek support from adults you trust and who can help you.",

            "That's classic dissociation. You need to get out of there. It sounds like your parents are selfish and abusive. You're not autistic, and they're fucking imbeciles for saying that (as that's not even close to autistic behavior). It sounds like they were probably way too young when they had you, so they stayed together (even though they hate each other) and have been selfish assholes your whole life, taking it out on you and not really treating you like their kid, more like a burden. You are NOT. You're a damn miracle, and the fact that you learned this DEFENSE MECHANISM speaks to your strength as a human being. Do NOT let them break you, love. Get out as soon as you can. Try to let their childish behaviors and lashing out just roll off like water on a duck; they only treat you like shit because they feel like shit and you're an easy target. Which is disgusting and unfortunate, but just remember it's not you. None of it is your fault. They are just weak and selfish people who will hopefully eventually realize what they've put you through. (Don't hold your breath for that, though, for your own sake). Please stay safe. Get help if you feel in danger, either from them or even yourself. Don't let them warp your self-image, either. That's the hardest thing about abuse, you start to feel like you deserve it. You do not. No one does, but especially not a child from their own parents. You're strong, you're beautiful, you're worthy of SO MUCH more than you are receiving right now. Just keep your chin up, you will get out of there. You are loved.",

            "It sounds like you\u2019re disassociating. It is a defense mechanism that your body learns to do when it can\u2019t fight back or run away from a threat (your parents). I do this too, but I haven\u2019t ever tried to stop doing it. Maybe using the keyword dissociate you can find some more information on it online and understand it more. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your home life is so bad. I remember when I was 17 I was facing an ill parent who because she was so sick, needed me to take care of her and would be nasty to me if I ever needed anything. Which of course I did, I was a kid. Then, when she found a boyfriend to do what I couldn\u2019t, she left. I lived in my house until all the utilities were shut off and I had to go ask my dad to live with him. It was the worst time in my life. \n\nIt will get better. If I could go back and do anything differently as a teenager it would be to get out of there as fast as I could, and not blame myself for all the awful emotions I had and my unhealthy coping skills. I would suggest looking up new ways to cope with abuse and toxicity and start to practice them. Build up your own self care and mental health because your parents aren\u2019t going to do that for you and you may find it buffers you from them and the pain they cause you.",

I\u2019m sorry you have to endure their fights. Sadly enough it isn\u2019t as rare as you or I would like it to be either. I don\u2019t think any child should have to go through that level of antagonization from either of their parents, let alone both at once.\n\nI hope that it gets better one way or the other for you OP.",
            "First off your parents are the literal worst. Fuck them and fuck what they are doing. Your \"spacing out\" is just a coping mechanism for all the stress you are currently under. It's just your brain trying to save you some pain and there is nothing wrong with it. I go into a similar state after having a panic attack. I would definitely go see a school counselor if that's available to you. Taking steps to take care of your mental health when you're in a bad place will not only be helpful now but long term when you inevitably have to deal with the mental health repercussions.",
            "Oh yeah, this is 100% familiar as someone who was raised in an abusive home. Dissociation is a strategy your brain uses to protect you from a bad situation. Honestly, it probably wouldn't matter much what you did. Your parents aren't really angry with you for zoning out. They'd be just as mad or worse if you fought back, or picked sides, or tried to mediate. They're not abusive for a reason, it's just what they are.",
            "What you're doing is a defense mechanism against abuse. I used to do it too when I was younger. \n\nOnce I moved out I always told people I can't handle yelling, and only formed relationships with partners who were aware and willing to work with me on it. After 3 years of being with a good person I'm finally able to advocate for myself and defend myself in a constructive way. Yelling doesn't scare me as much, though it's definitely not my favorite. \n\nYou can get over this, but I wouldn't while you still live with them. You're in survival mode, hopefully soon you can move out and be in a better place where you can focus on personal growth.",

            "That's called dissociating. It's a very normal thing to do when a certain type of situation gets overwhelming. I also used to do this alot when living at home (also not the happiest home life). It's a coping mechanism. It can be pretty hard to keep under control. I still do it in periods of high stress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI reccommend reading on the topic, and finding tricks that can help you ground yourself (ground yourself to reality). Different things work for different people. You can also work on seeing what triggers it specifically, or if some signs appear (i sometimes hear ringing in my ears, or get chills before i dissociate).",
            "As others have said, this is dissociation in an abusive environment. It's really REALLY common for people who have witnessed abuse (verbal or physical) as children. Kinda when the screaming starts your brain turns off and you make yourself very small and uninteresting. Really you have 2 issues here. \n\n1) that living in this environment is incredibly toxic for you and you need to have a plan to get out and away and not come back when that becomes a possibility as well as a strategies for living in that environment before you can get out. I'm sure there are subreddits with specific advice in those areas.\n\n2) that you are dissociating and don't seem particularly happy that you do this behavior. It seems to kind of freak you out a bit. I get it, it's uncomfortable not to be fully control of yourself.\n\nNothing is wrong with you. This reaction is likely to carry over into some situations you may experience in the future like being told off by an authority figure, dealing with an angry customer, an argument with a partner or really any uncomfortable or stressful conversation. That's the bad news. The GOOD news is that this is something a lot of therapist have experience working with and that people have near perfect success moving past this type of trauma reaction. I know a handful of people who had this type of trauma reaction in the past and no longer have it. If therapy isn't an option yet I'm sure with some research you can find some community resources and reading to help you get started.\n\nThis is not forever. It is the fault of the environment. Nothing is wrong with you.",
            "These responses are right... Fugue states are a pretty serious coping mechanism. If you need this to survive your circumstances, then you should probably make a solid GTFO plan. Make sure it includes councilling and financial independence. Then run, don't walk.",
            "As the top comment said this is dissociation, but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing, and it definitely does not make you autistic. Its a coping mechanism - its a way of making yourself feel safe when everything else feels dangerous. \n\nI dissociate a lot because of PTSD. I'm getting treatment for it because I feel unsafe everywhere, so I dissociate even when I'm taking a walk which is bad because I could be trying to cross a road while dissociating. For people who don't know what dissociation is like - such as your parents - it's really hard for them to understand why you do it. My boyfriend was the same and used to get scared about me crossing the street and getting hit by a car because I was dissociating. \n\nMy parents are like yours and they fought a lot. And neither of them made me feel like I could have a proper talk with them so I never tried to explain the dissociation.\n\nSometimes, even if you try to explain dissociation to someone they still won't understand. So I don't know if telling your parents about it is the right thing to do or not. If you believe your parents are the type to listen, you could try talking to them, explain to them that their constant fighting is toxic for you and is affecting your sense of security/safety. Maybe that'll give them a wake up call. \n\nIf you don't feel like you can talk to them, then just keep doing what you're doing. Dissociating so you don't have to listen to their shit is you coping with their shit, and they don't have a right to stop you because they're the ones making you feel that way. After my counsellor realized I've had PTSD for about 6 years, she told me she believes that I wouldn't have lasted as long as I did if I wasn't dissociating. I held out with my own toxic home life until I finally moved out, and now I'm doing a lot better. Still doing counselling though to get over my other issues. \n\nI hope you manage to figure it out OP \u2764\ufe0f sorry if I wasn't much help.",
            "That is dissociation. Please seek help.",
            "Hey, OP, to follow up with others, yes, this is a perfectly normal coping mechanism, I would definitely try to get out asap.\n\n  \n\n\nOnce you are in a safe environment, take some time to be aware that this mechanism will come back and maybe not in so helpful ways in the future. There is nothing wrong with using it now, however.",
            "I also did the same. I was out basically 20 seconds after I graduated high school.",
            "This is actually a pretty normal trauma response. I grew up in a similarly chaotic home and did the same thing. \n\nI don't really have advice for your situation other than maybe expressing to them that it's a coping mechanism to deal with all the yelling and let them know all the fighting has been negatively affecting you. It may help them back off a little bit. \n\nMore than anything, I suggest you do everything  in your power to get good grades, and go to a college where you need to live away from home. If college isn't in the cards for you, start saving up to move out the day you turn 18. Find some roomates around your age (do a coffeeshop hang or meeting b4 moving in) and work fulltime, it's pretty doable especially if you move somewhere with a low cost of living.   \n\nFinally, remember that this zoning out thing may be an effective tool to get you through a tough time rn, it won't be good if you start doing this to avoid all conflict, say in a romantic relationship or work. That said, setting a boundaries like \"we take a break from talking if were getting to a yelly or rude point\" is a healthy way of figuring out how to push through tricky communication moments.",
            "As a parent I\u2019m sure deep down inside they must feel ashamed for how they behave - to each other and towards you. When they yell at you, are mad at you, what they\u2019re really expressing is anger towards themselves, seeing the way you react makes them realize they have failed you as parents. They are people too and obviously flawed. Unfortunately you can\u2019t help them, or change them - they have to want those things themselves. Take care of yourself - obviously their parenting, their issues and fighting is severely affecting you and may even cause issues in your future relationships. As hard as it may be try to remember that their anger isn\u2019t really at you but themselves or each other. And sadly it\u2019s hurting their relationship with you. Be well.",
            "don't be afraid. in life, you will just have to leave some people behind or suffer forever their abuse, even long after they're gone if the abuse is severe enough.\n\nit's better for you, and believe it or not, it's better for them, no matter how they might manipulate you into staying. they do live with guilt about what they have done and regularly continue to do, it's just that when their borderline episodes kick in, they aren't thinking about anything but the red mist clouding their judgment, no matter what the future consequences are.\n\njust leave them behind. they know not what they do, and there's nothing that can be done for them, particularly by you, the child and thus property of theirs that they can easily rationalize treating however they like in a moment of weakness.\n\ngood luck.",
            "Hi, this sounds very similar to something I went through. I would disconnect if I witnessed arguments among other people or if someone was raising their voice at me. In my case this was a major symptom of PTSD, and I think that it was also related to years of general depression.  I don't know how to explain it very well, but dissociation is like the \"freeze\" mode of the fight/flight/freeze response. When you are in that state, inputs are going to \"the wrong place\" in your brain, and they don't get processed as inputs should. As a consequence, I  suspect that things that were said around these events tend to \"replay\" in your head later on, is that right? If this is the case I would recommend that you get treatment for PTSD, specifically EMDR. You probably won't have access to this therapy while you are living with your parents but please consider looking into it when you can, especially if you have unexplained problems later on.",
            "You can do teletherapy on your parents insurance. Your 17 its confidential if there is a bill for a co pay and they asked about. Tell them yes you are going to therapy invite them to a session. If they start screaming at you it's ok to tell them that you are not responding to this behavior and walk away. You will be surprised how will it works. It took me 46 years to start therapy to stand up to my abusive mother. Ofcourse seek advice from friends or their parents if you're comfortable if you have a pastor to talk to until you can find a therapist. You should have your medical card, if not ask for it.

You ask what do you do to stop reacting this way, but really, if they want you to stop, they need to stop abusing you in the first place.

            "Okay, so this happened to me all the when I was 13 all the way to when I was around your age. For me it was because of my ADHD. I would look into that if you are not diagnosed with that officially. I could be wrong, but it sounds like your parents are way too harsh on you from what you\u2019ve said. I assume that talking to them might not be an option, but you know the situation way better than I do (obviously). If you feel safe and secure enough to communicate your feelings to your parents, that would be a good place to start. The best path to solving this conundrum is working through your personal relationship with your parents and working as a team. If that is not possible, though, you could always try looking into some kind of therapy. Not sure if you are already in therapy or not, but it is a great experience from my point of view. It has really helped me with things I struggled with and still struggle with to this day. Just make sure you get the right kind of you consider that. If your new to it, it might be scary. Totally worth it in the end, though. Hang in there!",

Different stuff works for different people. In general there's noting weird going on, it happens to a lot of people who went through emotional trauma in childhood. I am sorry. I really am.

Any exercise works, from yoga videos to pushups to walks. Focusing on the physical body can help find stability when your brain is overwhelmed. You could also try a bath/warm shower, holding and smelling a hot cup of tea or coffee, or any work with your hands (knitting, puzzles, legos, gardening, models, drawing, baking...).",

            "So just a little advice for the real world when you grow up a bit, when your professor, boss, husband, kids etc start saying things to you that you don\u2019t wanna hear, \u201cspacing out\u201d ain\u2019t gonna fly. To be blunt, you need to learn to face problems like an adult, which is only 1 year away for you. Eye contact, communication and reciprocation go a long way and pretty soon you will grow mentally stronger to face these things head on like an adult. Trust me, you don\u2019t want to get into the habit of these avoidant behaviors because it only gets WAY more stressful down the road. You have no idea. Now is the time to develop strength and resilience for confrontation when you are young and there are no stakes. Play out this example in your head. You land a new job, boss is a d***, but it pays well and helps put food on the table for your family. Your kids wanna get into a good college and this job means everything to you and your family. Your boss gets in your face over something stupid and because you never learned how to confront issues, you \u201cspace out\u201d on him or try not to space out, but instead get lost for words due to never developing healthy and mature confrontational strategies.  What are you gonna do? Get out of your comfort zone and accept these head on. It\u2019s awkward and uncomfortable but so is life. You will adapt like everyone else who went through exactly what you are going through",

            "I'm not seeing a lot of advice here about sitting down and talking with them, which surprises me to be honest. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the way I read it is they're mainly mad with each other. Maybe they don't realize the impact their fighting has on you which causes you to dissociate. I would suggest you sit down with one of them when they're not fighting, (not talk to them both at the same time) and tell them what it's like from your perspective and why you zone out and that this situation is clearly untenable. If I interpreted your situation wrongly then other measures might be necessary, but other commenters here seem to think your parents don't care about you or are abusing you, but I think they might both be very emotionally vulnerable because of the situation and since they are human that means they won't always deal with it the right way. They might be horrified if they realize what they're doing to you by fighting all the time. But I don't know enough about your situation to decide if this is just emotional humans who are caught up in their own crap or abusive parents.",
            "You might be simply tired of their non sense fight and don't want to confront with their anger.\nFirst what you can try to do is open the dialogue with them in a peace situation, not during a fight. Explain how painful it is for your to hear them arguing and how you're not ready to face such situation.\nThen if they don't understand, you're completly right to avoid the conflict by any mean. Just warn them in a peace situation \"I'm sorry I can't handle you're anger for myself, next time you're fighting I'll go walking for a couple minutes the time for you to calm down\" and just get the f**k out",
            "\"What? Do you need an audience for your fights?\"",
            "This is called dissociation and it's not dangerous at all. You'll come round in your own time, dont rush it",
            "this seems more suited for a therapist than anyone here..",
            "OP, uh, that's heavy disassociation. It's not an autism thing, it's a sign of traumatic events, such as the fairly often example of a lifetime of abuse. I'd get a lot of proof and try to take my chances as a ward of the state if I were you, or try to get emancipated and live somewhere else while you're still young so they don't ruin everything about your life. I'd also suggest seeking therapy ASAP for your own good. After the crap you described, I'm honestly shocked you don't have WAY worse, so, once again, still young, I suggest seeking therapy to address everything you've gone through. I know first hand that parents aren't always great. I love my mom, but she wouldn't leave my dad and desperately needed to. My whole life, he's been cheating on her, and they'd have screaming matches, but he was the one with anger issues, and while most the time he'd ignore  his kids, occasionally he'd get mad and accuse me of being disrespectful. Well, I'm nineteen now, don't live with him, and the last time he tried to lay hands on me, I broke a cane over his head and layed him out in front of our family. It all escalated that far because I don't disassociate when they shout or he gets mad. I learned to cope with fear and sadness by turning them to anger, which I would argue it MUCH less healthy. Took me years to get to the point where I won't just haul off and beat the crap outta someone for insulting me. So go talk to someone, now, before any real problems that could occur actually do.",
            "Good advice...follow suit.",
            "I used to \"space out\" when I was a kid. My teachers and parents scolded me frequently and told me I was doing it for attention (I was like 6 years old). Turns out 10 years later they found out I had epilepsy, which is also triggered by stressful situations such as my parents screaming at me. I'm not saying you might have epilepsy, just that I've been there as well and I understand how you feel. I'm still traumatised about it. Instead of being empathetic and caring for me they scolded a 6 year old for wanting \"attention\" (which is somehow a bad thing coming from a little kid I guess?). Oh, they also used to use it as a \"funny\" anecdote as I grew up, mocking me and laughing for spacing out in stressful situations. Until I had a seizure in front of my whole class and I was diagnosed. Guess it wasn't funny anymore. But it was too late; the trauma and feeling that I'm an attention whore is probably never going to leave me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: It's very common for people to space out during stressful situations, but if this ever starts getting more serious I suggest you discard having some sort of epilepsy. Check that no one in your family has it. Emotional stress can also trigger a dormant epilepsy if you already had a genetic predisposition (like in my case), or if your brain has ever experienced some sort of physical trauma. BUT it's very rare and you're probably fine.",

It struck a chord deep in me with how many outsiders had such a different perspective on the issue, where I thought I wasn\u2019t being firm enough and my friends were just ignorant in terms of the ramifications of their actions, whereas the vast majority of commentators thought they were just plain assholes and racists. I guess I was hoping if I was simply firm in my resolve, and told them in no uncertain terms if their disrespectful behavior were to continue we could no longer continue socializing, they would see the error in their ways and hopefully apologize to my wife. \n\nSo yesterday, I asked them if we could all meet up to discuss something important, and after work we all went for drinks. Once we started talking, I told them how disrespectful they were being towards both my wife and I, and addressed how much it had hurt my wife to be made fun of just because of her accent and ignorance when it comes to American customs. I continued by saying that I understand we usually joke about these sorts of topics, such as race, but that I now realized how wrong it was and it all needed to stop. They did not take me seriously at all. Immediately everyone began commenting on how much of a \u201cbitch\u201d I\u2019d become since getting married, and I was always so prissy and sensitive about shit we\u2019d used to laugh about all the time. They continued by saying I never enjoyed myself anymore, and how I\u2019d basically abandoned our group because I was always spending time with my wife. I was constantly trying to respond, or defend myself, but the fuckers kept interrupting me and wouldn\u2019t let me say anything. They also said I stopped partying like I used to, like what the fuck? Sorry I\u2019m not interested in getting shitfaced at the club every Friday night, we\u2019re not in college anymore. Then one of the guys says, \u201cAre you being all uptight because you\u2019re not getting laid anymore? I\u2019m surprised man, if my wife was as hot as (my wife\u2019s name) I\u2019d be banging the shit out her everyday.\u201d Then all of them fucking laughed like he\u2019d made a hilarious joke instead of being a massive douche bag. After that I was done with them, and told them they I no longer wanted to socialize with people who were being completely disrespectful and held bigoted attitudes towards my wife, then left. \n\nOnce I got home, my wife immediately asked what was wrong. I suppose I must\u2019ve still looked pissed off over what transpired.  I told her how sorry I was over the way I handled the situation, and she would no longer have to deal with their mocking and bullying. She looked extremely guilty that I said this, and told me I didn\u2019t have to sacrifice my happiness and friendships just to please her, and I should continue hanging out with them if I really wanted to. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m kind of embarrassed to admit it but I started crying like a baby. This women, who\u2019d left everything behind, her life, family, friends, to travel halfway across the world to a completely different country all on the promise that I would provide her with a better life, thought this entire situation was her fault, and was saying I should prioritize my happiness over her own feelings or well-being. It broke me, and made me realize what a selfish prick I was. So I spent over an hour convincing her this wasn\u2019t her fault at all, and that she should never believe my feelings are more important than her\u2019s, and whenever she is feeling hurt, or angry, she should express those feelings without ever thinking it was wrong to do so. I\u2019m very saddened by how long I had allowed this to transpire, and have a ton of making up to do. \n\nAlso, I just wanted to express my thanks reddit. This was the main reason I posted an update, your guys\u2019 comments really helped take the wool off my eyes and understand the reality of the situation. We\u2019re in a much better place now because of it, and I truly do appreciate everything, thank you. \n\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Got rid of my friends, you were right they are bunch of assholes",

It's not surprising that friends and co-workers are teasing you based on how our society views this practice but that does mean you should feel guilty or ashamed for your traditions. To be fair though, even non-arranged marriages are often the center for ridicule among some circles of friends. The once permanent bachelor is endlessly mocked by his friends for giving up drinking and partying to settle down. A very attractive women is mocked by her friends for marrying an unattractive man who is kind to her and has a steady job. Traditions or not people will at some point find themselves at the middle of an uncomfortable situation when they make a choice that fits some stereotype others find hilarious or controversial for whatever reason. Some people feel they are entitled to bully someone endlessly when they think other's share their opinion. It's like the heard mentality you hear about, safety in numbers and all of that. The best you can do is tell them to quit and if they don't report them to HR. You can always find new friends. \n\nTLDR: People are assholes, report them if you work with them and move on. ",

            "Hello friend. I wanted to share my story with you, and I hope you get time to read this. \n\nI'm 25F. My father got married to my mother about 26 years back in India. We all shifted to Singapore about 25 years ago. He's a well educated man with a masters in software programming and earning big bucks while my mother is from a small village in India and has only studied to a bachelors and that too in Hindi/Marathi medium. \n\nWhen she got married to my father(arranged marriage, both were still in India), she took care of the house, took care of my bedridden grandmother and incredibly strict grandfather and gave birth to me. She's soft spoken and sweet, very typical nice indian housewife and sometimes speaks up against things that she doesn't agree with but never fierce or angry in her demeanor. I have never seen her or can imagine her raise her voice on anyone. She has never even shouted at me for anything even when scolding me when i was a child. Basically, what you have described your wife as sounds pretty similar to what my mum is like. \n\nSo anyway back to the point, when we migrated here 25 years back, my mother was not even able to string together a proper english sentence, she didn't have any friends here and my father used to work hours and late nights to feed us and keep a roof above our head and she supported him and me in every way she was able to. She kept our family together and supported my father every step of his life and career.\n\nI only got to know of this when I got older. My father told me privately one night, if he brought her to any outings with his colleagues, they wouldn't treat her with the same respect they treated him with. Once when she had answered the house phone when my dad's colleague called home, he spoke to her as though she was the maid and later told my dad \"eh, i called your house but your maid had answered\". Many things similar to what you have described have probably happened and my dad has probably kept it from us and didn't want to hurt my mother any further. She's not stupid, she probably knew that such comments were being made about her. \n\nAnd that is when my father made the decision to stop going to these gatherings and to stop associating with these people. It isn't very mature or sensitive of people to say such things, and you'd think they were adults and would understand but nope. He encouraged my mother to take up english speaking lessons, typing lessons and so on. I know picking a language at the age of 25 is incredibly difficult and maybe she just doesnt have that aptitude for language or just was not motivated enough to put in that effort, so even today she is not completely fluent in the language. You could motivate your wife, who knows it might have a different outcome if she pursues the language diligently. :)\n\nBasically what I want to tell you is that this isn't going to be an easy journey, at times it will be difficult, but these decisions will have to be made over and over. Know where you are going to draw the line in social situations and know when the limit has been crossed. My father works in a famous and reputed MNC at the senior management level and even then he skips going to the gala dinners and annual events where people usually bring their plus-ones because he does not want my mother to feel small or embarrassed because of her poor command of the English language. She is worth much much more and has given our family so much that we cannot put into words. If there is even a chance that a judgmental prick or haughty bitch is going to pass a remark and make her feel small, he is not going to go to that event or bring her along. To him, she means family, and family always comes first. \n\nFrom my part, just on this issue about language alone: There have been times when I have resented her for not picking up the English language. I used to think hell 25 years in Singapore is no excuse to not know how to speak English perfectly, even with an accent. I even brought her to english classes a couple of years back. But there isn't much that I can do if she lacks the motivation as she is comfortable having us as her world. Slowly as I matured I realized that not all of us need to have the same priorities, maybe to her being fluent in english is not a priority, maybe she values spending that time with us or going out to the gym more. I can only try my best to motivate her as her daughter. However, breaks my heart if for some reason we do end up at a dinner function or something and everyone is speaking in english and someone speaks to my mum in fluent english or uses fanciful language and my mum replies back with broken english and smiles. People's expressions change or they stop talking to her. I don't understand how adults can be like this. She is so much more than that, but why and how will they know. I could pass it off as she is just lacking motivation and is never going to be interested to improve her english, but it terribly breaks my heart when my own non-hindi/marathi speaking friends come over and try to strike a conversation with her and she isn't able to have a full conversation of express herself fluently in English. Most of my friends are very nice and understanding people so I don't see them making such remarks. It breaks my heart so much because otherwise she is a very chatty person in Hindi/Marathi. However, I am thankful that she has managed to find a group of similar ladies who are her best friends now and have kitty parties and cook good food and play simple games and have small religious/spiritual groups to discuss. It's a lifestyle i will never be able to fit in but I am glad that she has this in her life, maybe that is what she feels she should do more in life, again, who am i to dictate how anyone should live their life. \n\nBack to the point and summing up, my father is very similar to me-outspoken,bold,adventurous,loud,popular etc and my mother is the complete opposite. What made their marriage work and has kept them together is two way commitment and respect. He valued his wife's respect and feelings more than his own enjoyment with his friends or going out for beers and gatherings and socializing and so on. And today I hold him in a light that i find unparalleled to any of the people that I know of around me. I do not have such respect for anybody else in the world as much as I respect my father. I hope you see yourself in the same way someday and if you do have kids one day, remember that one day they too will look at you in a light similar to how I appreciate and respect my father for making these bold and tough decisions.  I hope your story turns out maybe even better than my parents' story. :)\n\nWith lots of love from Singapore. :)",

I'm sure in your culture it's different, bit when people hear arranged marriage in the US they think pedophiles and such. Is that view ignorant? Yes it is. So if you want to educate your friends and win them over, how can you do it?\n\nFirst, minimize the arranged part and focus on the marriage. Why you even had to tell them it was arranged is beyond me. \"Arranged\" can mean anything. Are you both consenting adults? Did you both agree to get married? Then you had a marriage. That's all there is to it.\n\nOkay so if your wife feels humiliated then just tell them that. No one likes to be lectured. You have to be subtle. \"Hey guys all the jokes are making my wife feel bad. She doesn't get the kind of humour **we like to have** so can you just to e it down a bit when she is around?\" See that? You let them know you are still their fiend and you improve the situation. \n\nI know everyone is congratulating you on telling off your friends. You certainly have to put your wife before them. But you took the easy way out instead of the smart way. Your friends are ignorant and a bit uncaring toward this cultural idea but surely they are not bad people. You could have won them over and educated them a little had you tried to be subtle about it. Instead you called them out publicly. Not sure why you expected a different response.",
            "I personally don't believe in arranged marriages. I'm not gonna mock you or your marriage for it though. It's not my place. Just because I'm not going to have one, doesn't mean I should belittle yours. \n\nI just don't understand this mindset.",
            "It's a come to Jesus moment for many people of color. You get to a point people are laughing at you not with you. You are rid of them.",
            "Arranged marriages. Wtf. ",

            "I'm sorry those American pricks  lack maturity and empathy. You chose well.",
            "Good on you for making the decision to let your \"friends\" (if you could call them that -- I wouldn't) go.  A lot of people aren't mature or strong enough to cut negative people out of their lives.  Your wife sounds like a lovely lady.",
            "I would argue that this was a poor venue for your arguments. People dont go out drinking and expect to be told off.\n\n\nTaking a friend out to lunch/coffee one at a time and explaining whats going on might have worked out better. You can make a more personal argument. He/she would be more receptive to a conversation instead of trying to have a good time with friends.\n\n\nI'm not saying these people arent assholes. But going drinking isnt going to make people willing to have a deep conversation about moral responsibility and empathy.",
            "Damn dude, you stuck up for your wife majorly. Enjoy the blow job.",
            "Arranged marriages are fucking dumb, though.\n\nOn here your just going to get one response: \"Stop being friends with them!\" as they smell their farts.\n\nAnd how the fuck is being against arranged marriage possibly racist? No one is hating on race. Surely criticism of traditional, and often unethical, cultural activities is not racism. As individuals can CHOOSE how to respond to tradition whereas they cannot choose their ethnicity. ",
            "I'm a little in love with you myself. Good for you.",
            "Well done. I imagine as your former friends grow and mature, they'll have their own relationships and realize what douchenozzles they were. Maybe they'll even tell you so.",
            "pics?",
            "I bet you made racist comments along with them and joked about other cultures and people until it was applied to you. If thats the case then you deserve it.",
            ">arranged marriage\n\nI will never have sympathy for you.",
            "[removed]",
            "You write, \"Got rid of my friends.\" \n\nWell, if it's that easy, they never were your friends to begin with. Perhaps you don't really know what friendship is. Maybe you can have your parents arrange some friends for you as well.",
