It started with, as predicted, a wall of tears when I brought up our relationship but following the advice I just kept going.  I think I sat at the kitchen table for almost 5 hours in total until she finally gave in and sat down to talk without crying. \n\nThere was a whole lot of resentment built up towards me which was why she couldn't face me and tried to keep me busy so I did not have time or energy to focus on the relationship.    \n\nShe brought up a lot of things that I did wrong, the fact that I only work 5 hours a week and that's not fair, that I make her feel inadequate by doing everything so well while being ill as well, that I only eat real food and don\u2019t drink which is not fair on her, that I have a better relationship with her mom than she does, the fact that I am really skinny and she has to battle with her weight, that I have a loving family and she doesn\u2019t , and that I am not good at sex which really hurt as she is my one and only and I thought I was doing OK.  \n\nNone of that hurt as much as what she said right towards the end of a heated exchange when she blurted out that I \"should be dead by now\". \n\nAfter I had had a break and calmed down, I came back into the kitchen to face a diatribe where the long and short of it is she does want children badly; she doesn't want to be married to me because I'm stopping her having them and I'm sick which she is tired of, and only went ahead with getting married knowing we couldn't because she thought I would have died by now.  \n\nShe then confessed (not sure that is the right word more like blurted out angrily) that throughout our dating and engagement she had wanted to end it because she didn't want to marry a dying man but could not face telling everyone because they would have thought she was callous.  She said felt she was pressured into marrying me because I was sick, she had thought that I would not survive and  when I died she could find someone else who could have kids.\n\nI was really upset so I left to go to the den and stayed there for the rest of the night;  I didn\u2019t sleep much but thought we could work it through and we could find a way for her to have kids even if I wasn\u2019t around.   I\u2019d even found some agencies that would consider IVF for us given my family would definitely be there for the long haul even if I wasn\u2019t.  \n\nIn the morning I made breakfast and waited, she surfaced at about 9 and so I sat her down at the kitchen table and I calmly told what I was thinking about asked her what she wanted to do?  \n\nAgain I got a wall of tears but waited them out, then I got a really angry response which made no sense. She said she might not be able to have children anyway, so we should stay together until I die,  and that it was my fault she wouldn't be able to have kids.  \n\nI knew there was a possibility that conceiving could be difficult for her as she'd had a really bad gynaecological infection a few months after my last chemo round.  We argued about this for ages, that she couldn\u2019t know until she tried, that her position did not make sense, she argues against IVF as an option saying it was too difficult for her, that is she really wanted kids naturally then it would-be best to split and her find someone who could give her that. \n\nOver the space of an hour, it became clear that the infection was not something simple as I had thought. I could not understand how an infection could make you infertile and kept asking what it was. She was really evasive until I made her tell that the infection was chlamydia.  Although she didn't say it out loud just cried when I asked was the result of an affair. \n\nWhen I realised what she had finally (not) said through the tears I left, didn't say anymore just collected the dogs from the yard, piled into my Landy and went to my brothers.   \n\nI spent most of the day in bed crying until my brother got me on Skype with my big sis and mum who were great and really practical.  Then I went over to my sis\u2019s place to exercise the dogs with her and that made me feel a little better. \n\nSo since yesterday I\u2019ve had 100+ ignored calls and texts from her, and she\u2019s tried to call my brothers, parents and sisters.  Mer mom has called 10+ times.  My brother has texted her and her mom to leave me alone and that I\u2019ll be in touch when I figure it out.  She showed up at his house while I was at my sister's but he sent her away. \n\nFor me its the end.  I don't want be with someone who has had an affair, who doesn\u2019t like me, who resents what they have given up because of me, who lies, who tells me I\u2019m the one and only partner she\u2019s ever had, who is emotionally weak - who the fuck gets married because they don't want to seem callous.   I\u2019ve wasted the past four years on her, fuck. \n\nPlan for the rest of today is to pick up my big sis who is flying in from DC with her wife and go with them to see a lawyer they know, pick over how to get out of this mess quickly.  She\u2019s not a divorce lawyer herself but her firm drew up the prenup so it will be good to have her around.   Then she, my brother and sister, and various spouses and friends, are going over to the house to collect my things and clear my den/office.  \n\nI\u2019ll give my soon to be ex about 1/4 hours notice we are coming over but I won\u2019t go in and I can stay in van if she\u2019s there. I\u2019m gonna be moving into mum and dads old house with my sister for a while, there\u2019s loads of space and the dogs will love it. \n\n(For info I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m clean of STI\u2019s because we didn't have sex during that time and I have my bloods done every month but have booked in for extra tests on Thursday - an infection could have killed me but perhaps this was her plans all the way along) \n\n**tl;dr**: She didn\u2019t want to marry me, but anyway because she thought I wouldn't last too long and when I was last ill she had an affair.  Its over. \n\n**EDIT**  Its stupid o'clock in the morning and I can't sleep anymore so I came here.  Just to answer a few of the common and not so common but relevant theme in the PM's and comments. \n\n**Infidelity** As my lawyer pointed out I cannot be sure that she had an affair.  I made the presumption based on her tears and refusal to answer.  She has denied saying that she did in an email to my brother. \n\n**Chlamydia** It is possible that she had the infection from prior to our relationship although she had told me that I was the only one she had ever had sex with so there's a lie in there somewhere. This could explain that the infection did so much damage i.e. she had it for 4-5 years. \n\n**Infection and our sex life** We did not have unprotected sex before she was diagnosed. The advice we had was to use a barrier method to ensure that she was not exposed to chemical toxins in my body.   I got really ill a few months after we got married so it \"dried up\" and she had had treatment by the time we went on our honeymoon about a year later.   Our  sex life after that was really very good (or at least \nI thought so) up until about 5 months ago when a lot of things about \"us\" went off the rails. \n\n**Money** Turns out it really doesn't matter much, the house is on a lease because I couldn't get a mortgage as I'm such a bad risk health wise.  It's in my name so we'll issue a termination and let it lapse. She can take it up anyways.  Currently, most of my income is taken with medical bills so even if she tries to get alimony then there is nothing to share.  As for preexisting monies that pretty much safe with almost no option to challenge.  I've changed my will already to exclude her and yes she did get everything, but I don't think that was a motivation.  \n\n**Is she a monster** I don't think so, right now I hate the thought of her,  but I can see how she got into the situation where she married me thinking that it wouldn't last forever and how she could have felt trapped into the wedding.  I don't think she married me with the thought of getting rich I just think she didn't actually think it through properly.  She did turn out to be a shit though. \n\n**Do it still love her** Of course I do.  She was my rock during some really dark periods in my life, I wanted to die in her arms, we had so much fun together - I watched a video earlier of us playing air-hockey me in a big coat with bare legs as I only had a hospital gown on underneath her looking amazing lovely - we were so happy.   Notwithstanding all of that I do think we would not have made it in the long term even if I had been healthy all along. My mum thought I only stayed with her because it was the easy thing to do and I'd had enough shit in my life though until last night she had never told me that. \n\n**Will I let her tell her side of the story** she can say what she wants to whomever she wants except me. I'm done and only need good things in my life. ",

            "Fuck. I almost commented on the last post how manipulative she seemed with her constant \"wall of tears\" and refusal to discuss anything but decided against it as the other commenters had it more than covered.\n\n....But this....this is just....inhuman. \n\nI'm so, so sorry for you but SO, SO happy for you that you've rid yourself of at least ONE cancer from your life entirely. Because that's exactly what the fuck she is. I hope she lives a miserable, wretched life.\n\nGrab a hold of those pups and give them lots of love, hang around your family for awhile as planned and try to keep your head up. You are SO much better off.",

            "Just so you know, bloodwork of any kind wouldn't show chlamydia, you have to provide a urine sample (or get a urethral swab test, but that's only for symptomatic cases). And it's not included in routine urinalysis, either. Docs don't usually order STI testing on cancer patients, so just make sure to ask specifically about getting tested! And you should probably get checked for everything else out there, who knows what you've been exposed to \ud83d\ude15",
            "Having read your original post and what she said I'm wondering if there wasn't a motive towards your money as well. If you were bringing in 95% of the income and there was a healthy prenup, what did your will look like? Sole inheritance to your widow? Hell, even if you gave it all away her elective share would probably be fairly healthy on a whole.\n\nYou said in your original post you've been battling for 11 years? I mean, shit, you'd already managed to beat your original prognosis by at least 5 years by the time you married her. Why did she think you were going to just be dead within 4 years of being married? If not sooner?\n\nHonestly the whole thing feels disgustingly advantageous. I am sorry that you have to go through all this but you sound like you have an awesome support system who is there for you 100%. Cut her loose and move through it to move on.",

            "I read the first paragraph where she went through all her \"complaints\" about you and thought, wow... none of those have anything to do with you and everything to do with her low image of herself. After reading the whole thing, I can't believe she actually complained about you making her feel inadequate being skinny due to cancer. Anyways, keep fighting man, and I hope you feel better with one less illness in your life.",
            "Holy shit. What a horrible human being. Absolutely revolting and pathetic. \n\n\nYour ex is unworthy of love.\n\n\ngood fucking riddance. You deserve so much better OP.",

            "That... is quite a load of baggage right there. I know you're hurting right now, but at the very least you were able to arrive at a decision to move past this in a relatively short span of time. It may be a long tunnel you have to drive through, but you can see the light at the end of it. \n\nI'm also glad that you have such a strong network of friends and family to support you in such trying times. Best of luck with everything. ",
            "Holy crap, I'm so sorry!!!  She has been a terrible person, and you have been amazing.  This is going to hurt and suck for a while.  You fought through the tears and lies and finally got her to be honest,and while the outcome isn't what you wanted, at least now you can stop wasting your time with someone that shallow. Hang on to your family, they sound wonderful!",
            "Well, at least you are done with this horrid person.  My jaw dropped further and further when I read her list of \"complaints\" about you.  Sounds like she thinks it's \"not fair\" to her that you are such an amazing person.  So on the bright side, you know that you are awesome, you know that your wife is a piece of shit, and you are getting rid of her all at once.  It was especially amusing that she laid out this laundry list of things \"you did wrong\" so she could blame you, and then couldn't even admit to her affair.  You're so much better off without this monster in your life.  ",
            "Take solace I knowing that you are leaving someone who is mad at you for all their shortcomings. That you are leaving someone who told you you were the only one while she had an affair, contracted an STD, that might render her barren but was full ready to take it out on you. That she is mad at you for how well established you are in a weakened state but her firing at all cylinders pulls in 5-7% of what you do. It may not seem like it, but you won. Not that this was a competition for happiness, but if it was you set the new high score.",

            "At first, when she was listing her problems with you, it just sounded like she has a lot of issues with her self (like being mad at you for being to skinny, really is just her dissatisfaction with her own weight) but as soon as she said that you were \"supposed to be dead already\" that was the moment when it became incredibly obvious that she was a terrible person.

I'm sorry you wasted so many of your precious years with this monster.  I truly hope that you recognize that and are able to spend your remaining precious years with friends and family who actually care about you. ",

            "I feel so sad for you, I cant read the first post, but this seems to tell what's happened. Having had cancer last year and my ex trying to get every penny he could out of me, its hard to hear someone else going through it on a bigger scale. \r\rHe told me he was entitled to everything I had as he had to put up with me being sick and unattractive. Told me I would be back to an 8/9 when my hair grew back and I put enough makeup on not to look ill. He was a monster and I wouldn't wish it on anyone, with or without cancer on top. So sex whenever he wanted; dinner cooked every night; playing my xbox on my tv while I had to watch, I wasn't allowed to read or anything, just pay him all my attention; not go to uni or see friends and on top of that take care of all the living expenses as he couldn't afford anything as he spent it on stupid shit. He saw it as ok as I got 'free money' as my dad has private family healthcare through work and they paid me an amount with each chemo as I couldn't work or anything.  He couldn't even pause his game for 10 seconds to get me painkillers when I was crying my eyes out from how much pain I was in and couldn't move for fear of something else hurting, I had to get them myself, or wait an hour until he was free or having a loo break.\r\rThe cancer was just another tool he used to manipulate me. I got out but it left me with PTSD and student debt on a degree I will never go back to. On top of already having depression, anxiety and OCD. My therapist has a joke about me rattling with all the pills I have to take now.\r\rI'm so glad to hear you're getting out. Please stay out of her life. As soon as you can drop her and never speak again, do it. And make sure she wont benefit from anything else that happens in your life again. Life is hard enough without someone being like that at you. Make the most of the time you have and enjoy the little things. Leave your own mark on the world. She doesn't have to be a part of that. Any decent person wouldn't wait for someone to die for their own gain, she deserves the life of guilt she has set for herself. I would ask, who cheats on someone going through chemo? And then I remember my own experiences last year, there are some people too awful for words. You, on the other hand, deserve to spend your life surrounded by the good parts of life. Your family sound amazing, mine really got closer with my cancer, there was a lot if shit we needed to work through in therapy, but it seems we are on the other side now. \r\rI really hope you have therapy of some kind lined up. My hospital did cancer counselling and then put you on to a mental health team if they felt you needed more after treatment, I chose to go privately as it meant I had more choice. There are also schemes for families too, but they have to self refer. My mum speaks to someone every few weeks and my sister is on the waiting list.\r\rNone of this is your fault. You deserve love and good karma. You've had a shit time of it, hopefully the end of this relationship will lead to happier times. Its not a waste of four years, its crap you've had to go through to find the real you. I know that sounds hippy dippy as anything, but no one can understand what this is like, facing cancer. Its isolating even if your surrounded by people. When someone you thought cared about you betrays you like this it feels like you've lost a part of yourself. But you haven't, its just that you have to rebuilt that part of you, but stronger this time.\r\rMy only advice to you, apart from blocking her the fuck out of your life, is to reach out to people. You never know what their story is until you ask and telling your story can give them some comfort as well as comforting you. Leave good memories behind with the people you love and who love you.\r\rOP. I am proud of you. And I am proud to have read your story, you are doing your best with what's happened and it can only get better. Thank you and good luck. <3",

            "She is a disgusting person. Wow. Your successes was making her resent you.",
            "I can't believe that even after she told you that she wished she'd never married you and she only did it because she thought you'd die by now, you spent the night trying to figure out how to have kids with her.  It's actually wonderful that she had an affair, because at least THAT--and not everything else she said--was for some reason your breaking point.  ",
            "Just gonna be blunt- your wife is a parasitic piece of shit.\n\nGood for you for being so strong- now go find someone who deserves your love!",
            "Ugh. That is truly heartbreaking. The silver lining is that you have a wonderful family who is there for you and can help you find your way forward. I hope you get this awful harpy out of your life as soon as possible and get yourself on a happy path. Best wishes. ",
            "Okay, I totally don't condone the cheating and the lying.  You want to leave her over that, I am 100% totally fine and dandy with that.\n\nBut I keep coming back to these two statements. This edit from your original post:\n\n>I'm not considered an appropriate parent because I have a limited life expectancy. My prognosis is negative and at some point Izzy will be a widow. I hope and pray to God that this is in our twilight years, but I'm already 11 years over my expected life span so if I get to 50 I will be happy to have cheated death out of 34 years. \n\nAnd this one up above: \n\n>who the fuck gets married because they don't want to seem callous.\n\nFrom this post yesterday - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3v2vh9/i38m_want_an_outside_perspective_on_a/ - most commenters agreed that the family members who said \"don't marry the dying girl\" were callous and horrible.  So it's damned if she didn't marry you - because she was the evil girl who broke the dying cancer patient's heart - and now she's damned because she did.  (And made some extraordinarily bad choices - those were all hers.)\n\nSo I guess my question to you is how the proposal and marriage came about?  Because not everyone has the moral fortitude to get married to someone who is essentially terminally ill.  I'm thinking she knew that about herself, but was there this whole \"star-crossed lovers\" vibe about you getting together where it was going to be incredibly tragic that you never had time to get married?  \n\nBecause, yeah, I can see that if your wife loved you - and I'm guessing she did and probably still does - there might be a whole lot of pressure from family and friends to marry you.  I'm not saying she shouldn't have sucked it up and said \"No, I don't think I can do this\" - she totally should have.  But was she in a position where your social circle would have hated her completely if she hadn't gone through with it? \n\nI also quickly sifted through your comments, and saw no mention of your sex life, so I am curious.  My Mom died of colon cancer a few years ago, and one of the things that really hurt her was that because of her chemo, sex was out of the question for her and my father, even when she stabilized and felt better.  Because the chemicals used in her chemo made her mucous membranes potentially dangerous to my father - even with condoms, her medical team pretty much ruled out any sort of sex completely. So does your treatment impact your sex life to the point that your now ex-wife felt like she needed to have an  affair?  Because if she contracted chlamydia, she probably went without condoms.  Which doesn't appear to have impacted you.\n\nSo if your sex life was constrained because of your health issues and she felt pressured into a marriage that people were suggesting would be over shortly?  I can see how your wife got where she is today.  Not that I condone her choices in the slightest, but I can potentially see the steps.\n\nYou seem to have a really positive attitude about your cancer, which is great.  But so many people don't know HOW to deal with cancer patients.  They don't want to hurt cancer patients by being insensitive, but they can frequently do and say really stupid shit as a result.  If you've had cancer for 11 years, you know this by now.  This is just, you know, the stupidest shit possible your wife could have done, on about a million levels.\n\nI guess what this ramble is trying to get to is that I think it's fair if you don't want to forgive or forget.  But when you've settled down, I think you owe her a less emotional listen.  She has probably felt like her issues were always secondary to yours.  I know - I didn't tell my parents how my health was degrading, my marriage was stressed to a near breaking point, and my once successful business tanked because of the time I took to help out during her cancer.  You feel selfish as shit saying, \"I really need to do x, y, and z\" when you're watching someone you love stick to a prescribed routine that was forced upon them, all while they have to look down the barrel of their own mortality.  Worrying about your own priorities makes you feel small and petty...but it doesn't change the fact you still have your own priorities.  It can lead to a lot of resentment, which is where your ex-wife is now.\n\nI wish you those many extra years of health.  Stay active, keep doing what you're doing - I think it's great you found a professional routine that lets your body stay healthy, your mind engaged, and your moods upbeat.  You don't need to live with someone who is going to make that difficult for you, but you may need to concede that your health issues may have impacted her life more deeply than you ever realized.",

Since everyone expounded on your \"wife's\" personality, I won't go there.\n\nBut let's face the facts, she doesn't DESERVE YOU.  Do you know how many girls would think the world of you?  You work 5 hours a week and bring in a ton of money?  I want to LEARN how to be like you.  You deserve someone who is open minded, inquisitive and appreciative of a great cook, a great worker, a successful individual, and a health minded guy.  You sound like an effing catch.  Honestly, on paper, you're AMAZING.  Let me repeat that. YOU ARE AMAZING.  I personally know every single friend of my would LOVE to date someone like you.  However, the only girls you'll be able to have a great relationship with are those who are real with themselves and are able to acknowledge their issues.  Someone who's inquisitive, open minded and appreciative of you and what you've done.  Someone who uses you as support and inspiration.  Someone who... yea, you get the drift.\n\nShe's not there.  She doesn't want to own up to her failings, doesn't want to own up to what she's done, and doesn't want to own up to the fact that she's a bitch.  All of this is channeled into things not going her way, and her resentment towards you.  Honestly, this is hell in a hand basket.  There's nothing worth saving because to you, she's toxic.  Knowing all you've shared this is a HORRIBLE match between you two.  She doesn't want to improve herself, so she will never look upon you favorably.  She's always going to be jealous and resentful.  She's not at your level.  She's going to drag you down forever if you don't leave.",

She became infected with a disease that could have killed you, never told you and then INTENTIONALLY continued to have sex with you after admitting you should be dead by now. She attempted to murder you. I'll let that sink in for a moment. She may not have slept with you immediately, but she did end up sleeping with you. Call the police, file a report and have her ass arrested. Get a restraining order. Biological murder attempts are NOT taken lightly by the law, and even without her openly saying you should be dead by now, you can prove in a court of law VERY easily that she tried to kill you. What a disgusting despicable excuse for a human. I am sooo sorry that you had to waste your precious life on her. Be thankful you found out now. Spend some time traveling and with your family.

You have the drive and will to live, You work hard for the sake of yourself and your SO, and you are a caring person even in the face of extreme adversity even in the face of your wife telling you all these horrible things like her saying you were bad at sex you still thought of her situation and how she could have kids. That's a level of empathy and caring that not a lot of people have and it truly encourages me to better myself as well.\n\nI hope you continue living this way and keep setting that example for people. I'm sure you'll find someone who appreciates you despite the illness and who really means it when they say in sickness or in health.",
            "Damn mate, I would've been out of there as soon as she said \"you should've died by now\". What a terrible thing to say to someone you're supposed to love. What a terrible thing to say to anyone at all. You are not missing out on anything.",
            "I just want to say that you have a really good outlook on this and you've shown far more class and maturity than I think I could have. How has her reaction been to you deciding to divorce (That is if you even know or have spoken to her, no one would blame you if you haven't). Is she angry, sad or relieved? I'm sure you rightfully don't care at this point how she's feeling but just out of curiousity. I mean did she really think that she could get away treating you the way she did and just expect to stay married? I can't imagine she is surprised that things have come to this but I'm genuinely curious.",
            "Good for you. I hope you can find as much happiness and meaning in the remaining time you have. It looks like you can lean on your family; use that. ",

            "I'm going to go against the grain here. I don't think your soon-to-be ex wife is a vile manipulative person, just kind of genuinely afraid. Like the kind of person who lets insecurities and self doubt fester into resentment towards other people. People make horrible leaps to rationalize their behavior and avoid confrontation. She wasn't happy with herself or your marriage and didn't want to confront that. So when she told you that you should be dead by now, it wasn't as much about your money as it was because she didn't want to go through the pain of confronting the truth. She thought she could maintain the illusion of happy marriage until you passed, but you didn't. She crumbled before you did and was forced to confront the reality of it and that's why she resents you. To believe that she didn't care for you, though, is a bit of an exaggeration. It might be something she's let herself believe in retrospect, but you don't latch onto someone as long as that over fear alone.\n\nAnyway, I'm sorry, man. Here's a virtual hug, for whatever that's worth.",
            "It seems like you were in a sexless marriage if you never caught chlamydia but she had it long enough to get PID.",

            "Honestly, the affair is the least of the problems here. That's something you can work through. The fact that she resents you for being a happy, successful person while she's a total piece of shit is the bigger problem. You are better off my friend. Much much much much better off.",
            "Sad thing is she's going to get more than half your money. Good luck and hope you learned your lesson of getting married in today's society with 95% of the women being this fucked up"

        "selftext": "I\u2019m not really sure how to start this post so I\u2019ll just give some backstory first:\n\nOne of my best friends lives in a different country. We met years ago online and have talked almost daily to what is approaching a decade. We have both flown back and forth once or twice a year to see the other and hang out, and we\u2019ve always been their for each other\u2019s big moments. \n\nShe found out last year that she is expecting her first child, and it was amazing news for us all, I was so happy for her to start the family I know she\u2019s always wanted with her husband [31M]. She came to visit a few months into her pregnancy and asked me to be the baby\u2019s godmother - I was over the moon. \nWhile we live an 8 hour plane ride from each other, I do have a job that gives me decent vacation allowance and deals with certain airlines that makes visiting manageable. I knew that I could be there for her, and told her that whenever she was ready for someone outside of the family to be there, I would make the trip. \n\n\nLast month, she had her baby shower, and I only found out when I saw on Instagram a mutual friend [28F] who lives in the same city as me, had surprised her at the shower. I hadn\u2019t been invited. I was a little hurt, and surprised, but it was the busiest month of the year for the company I work for, and I knew she knew that, so I figured that could be the reason, sent my gift by airmail and said congratulations. \n\nHowever now she\u2019s reached out to me, and told me that she has asked another friend (the same person who went to the baby shower) to be the baby\u2019s godmother, and that she only wants her child to have one. I felt like I\u2019d been punched in the gut. I was heartbroken, and felt a bit betrayed, for 6 months I have been excited to take on the role - my own godmother lives in New Zealand, and has done for most of my life, so I knew it could work.m, knew how to stay in contact and be a part of the child\u2019s life while living in another country. But now she\u2019s taken back her offer, and chosen someone else.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be so upset if she had chosen someone who lived closer, but she has replaced me with someone who lives in the same city as me, so it\u2019s not a distance thing. We have been friends for years, I have been there with updates, support and love her whole pregnancy, and at no point was there any clue she had changed her mind... until the baby shower a few weeks ago. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I should confront her, tell her I\u2019m hurt, or just accept her decision, it\u2019s her baby, and I would never want to force her into a decision she wasn\u2019t happy with. I just don\u2019t know what to do or say to her now. I want to let her know I\u2019m sad that I\u2019m missing out, but I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m whining, and I want to know why she changed her mind, but I\u2019m scared the answer will just upset me. What should I do? \n\n\nTL:DR: My best friend asked me to be the godmother of her child months ago, now, with the due date approaching, she\u2019s chosen someone else and given no explanation. How do I tell her that hurts without sounding selfish? ",

            "I\u2019d reach out and mention that you didn\u2019t receive an invitation to the baby shower. She may have thought you were invited and ignored the invitation.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Are you sure you weren\u2019t invited to the baby shower? If invitations went out through mail then it could have gotten lost somehow. I\u2019m wondering if she took your not being at the baby shower as a sign that you either weren\u2019t interested or wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with the commitment. ",
            "Just to be clear, is she actually going to baptise her child? I know a lot of people who intend to raise their kids in a secular manner still nominate people to be godparents as a means of connecting them to their child. \n\nIf she is intending to baptise her child in an actual church, could it be that she changed her mind because the friend is more involved in the intended church than you? ",
            "I would definitely feel hurt as well and cannot blame you for being upset. First, I would ask about the baby shower and mention that you did not receive an invite. Her response will be telling because if it was an honest mistake and you were supposed to receive an invite, her reaction will tell you because then, it is possible, that she was hurt you did not come and chose your other friend. I'm curious, though, how did she react when she received your gift? Did she say anything about being sorry you missed her shower or she wished you were there?",
            "Yes, this is your friend's child and of course your friend and her husband get to decide who the godparents will be. That said, she also needs to understand that when she didn't invite you to the baby shower and backpedaled on making you godmother, there are social consequences to that. It's just really mean behavior and if she values your friendship, I think she owes you an explanation. ",
            "My feeling is that you must have done something, or at least be perceived to have done something. Not responding to an invitation to the baby shower would be the most obvious I guess, and I think you should ask because if you were deliberately not invited you probably aren't friends anymore. You have to know in order to get past this, but that means accepting the possibility that you won't like the answer. Are you close to her mother? Could you maybe ask her if you've done something to cause a rift? Say that you were surprised to find out about the baby shower after the event, and even more surprised that you were no longer considered godparent material, and are imagining all manner of ridiculous things and you'd like the truth so you can come to terms with it. You are allowed to feel hurt, because this is a hurtful situation, but it may be the result of a misunderstanding.",
            "So, from the post and your comments I think I know what might be going on here. You both have really bad communication.\n\nI'm seeing nowhere in the OP or the comments that you actually talked about what went down with the shower. You say her mother was making the preparations for the shower and was being vague about the timing of it. You should have been like \"Nancy, I need exact dates to book off.\" or you could have called your best friend and been like \"Hey, when is your shower exactly, your mom isn't being specific.\" because you knew the shower was coming up. \n\nI think your biggest problem here is you are very passive. It's been a month and as far as I can tell from what you've said, you still haven't said to your best friend/mother of child you want to be godmother to \"Hey, what the heck happened to my invite to your baby shower? Was it lost in the mail? Did you just not want me there? What's going on?\"\n\nIt's also the same thing with her changing up the godmother. She tells you that she's giving the job to the other woman and you didn't go \"Why? Is there something I've done, Best Friend? Are we okay?\" \n\nHere's how I see what you Best Friend is thinking, provided your best friend isn't pulling some sort of manipulative freeze out on you and she doesn't know her mother didn't send you an invitation:\n\nShe is pregnant and her best friend didn't come to her shower and didn't tell her personally why she wouldn't be attending her shower. All she did was airmail a gift and say congratulations. This is the woman I asked to be my child's godmother but she doesn't seem to have that much interest if she couldn't even tell me that she wasn't coming to my shower. Then we have Other Friend who is from the same city and she put in the effort to come to my party. That's amazing...hmm...maybe she would be a better godmother since she seems to be actually interested.\n\nSo I think the first thing you do when you talk to your friend would be to explain why you didn't attend the shower and perhaps apologize for waiting a month to explain your absence. Then you can discuss the godmother issue but I have a feeling that once you explain why you were a no show at the shower and why you never explained to her earlier why you were a no show, the godmother stuff might resolve itself.",
            "> Last month, she had her baby shower, and I only found out when I saw on Instagram a mutual friend \\[28F\\] who lives in the same city as me, had surprised her at the shower. I hadn\u2019t been invited \n\nJust you ask her about this? \n\n&#x200B;",
            "I see nothing wrong in asking her why she changed her mind. If you don\u2019t know how to approach the topic, you can always start with asking whether you have inadvertently done something that has led her to change the decision. It seems absurd, but apologising in case I had done something wrong before asking for clarifications on a relationship has often helped me to set a softer tone to the whole thing. As in \u201cI\u2019m not demanding an explanation, but I want to know if I hurt you because I care\u201d. \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve seen some comments on here saying to let it be because she\u2019s pregnant. Acknowledged that I don\u2019t know anything about pregnancies and that the best I can do is empathising with how stressful they must be, I call bullshit on that one. A person being pregnant doesn\u2019t entitle them to act in a way that hurts others, nor keeps them from being good human beings. You two are friends. Here there\u2019s something going on that needs clarification, if just for the sake of understanding which type of friendship yours is. You\u2019ve every right to politely ask her what\u2019s up. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to insult her and her whole family. So as worthless as my two cents are, don\u2019t normalise the \u201coh she\u2019s pregnant, it\u2019s understandable\u201d as an excuse for behaviours you find hurtful and don\u2019t understand. \n\nYou\u2019re hurt by her behaviour now, and there are two possibilities: either she wanted to hurt you, or she didn\u2019t want to. If she wanted to, you\u2019ll notice by how she replies. If she didn\u2019t want to, you bet she will be willing to talk to you about this and explain her reasoning.",
            "Yikes. It seems like such a shitty thing to ask, \"Will you be the godmother\" and then later say \"Never mind, we got someone else.\"",
            "I would confront her about not inviting you to the baby shower. I think THAT reason is related to why she changed the godparent part. ",
            "Yeah, bring it up. Just say to her \"Can we talk about the godmother situation?\" and be quiet - don't do the talking, just let her babble on. If she asks what specifically you want to talk about, tell her 'Well initially you said I was going to be the godmother, now I'm not, and I was not invited to the baby shower\". Keep it factual and let her do the talking. It will tell you what you need to know as long as you can listen.",
            "My husband and I were asked to be the godparents for our friend\u2019s baby. My husband was at their house one day after the baby was born and our friend says to the baby, \u201cgo see your godfather\u201d and hands the baby to SOMEONE ELSE. They didn\u2019t even have the decency to tell us they had changed their mind.",
            "Everyone is giving good advice, but I also want to let you know your feelings are valid. I would also be quite hurt if I was in your situation. ",
            "I think you should tell her you were hurt to have not been invited to her baby shower, and that you are hurt now to have this yanked back after she extended it, and see what she says. ",
            "Why didn't you ask her why you hadn't been invited to the shower? To me that would be step one, like, the day after you saw the shower happened. \n\nI agree with others, a no show to the shower may have indicated a non interest in God mothering. \n\nY'all need to communicate!",
            "Well that's a crappy thing to do.\n\nActions speak louder than words. She didn't invite you to the shower, and she removed you from a role you really wanted. What explanation would make you feel better? Probably nothing. She doesn't sound like a best friend anymore.\n\nIf she had never asked you to be godmother, I would feel totally differently about the situation. As is, she was extremely rude.",
            "i think something is going on that she didnt even send you a courtesy invite to the shower. my best friend and i lived across the world from each other for years and would still send each other invitations \"just in case\" \n\ni think you should gently ask if something is happening. ",
            "I\u2019d take some time to decompress and let the feelings go, and wait for her to settle down stress wise so you\u2019re both in a better place going into the conversation but it is shitty that she asked and gave you a position as important as it was, and obviously you was important enough to be initially asked. So why shouldn\u2019t you be able to ask why she wasn\u2019t invited to the shower, and had that taken away.\u201d\n\nBecause she\u2019s pregnant and stressed? No that\u2019s no a free pass. \n\nWhen you ask someone to take a MAJOR role in your life and then just don\u2019t explain why you changed your mind, the other person does have the right to ask why. You don\u2019t have to answer, but OP still deserves to be able to ask.\n\nOP-\nI don\u2019t know how interested I\u2019d be in a friendship with someone who would offer such an important role and then not tell you that they took it back last minute, and didn\u2019t even invite you to the baby shower and give you a chance to make it. \nIMO if you don\u2019t get invited to the baby shower, which is a place for all close family and friends to celebrate the new baby then they obviously don\u2019t want you involved, they didn\u2019t even want your gift...",
            "Who she picks for godparent is whatever.\n\nYou are hurt and concerned because:\n\n- You weren't invited to the baby shower\n- You were uninvited from being a godparent\n\nYou are writing off the first with some reason, but in this case it would make sense to openly ask her \"hey are we good?\".   You cite these 2 things as reasons why you think there might be a problem afoot.\n\nTo make this a little more tangible here is a script I'm thinking:\n\n> Ok, so I just want to check in and see if things are good between us.  There have been a couple of things come up that make me feel like that may not be the case.  I'm asking because I care and if there is something here I'd like to address it as you are a dear friend.   So there was a baby shower that I wasn't invited to... and then there is you retracting your request to be the godparent.   This isn't about who you want to be in that role, I am not trying to get you to justify your choice.  I am simply wanting to figure out if I have potentially done something to upset or offend you\n\nGo from there :)\n",
            "I think you should absolutely address this, but in a non-confrontational way. \n\nI'm also wondering why you didn't approach her about the baby shower in the first place. You knew she was pregnant and you knew that a baby shower was in planning since you've received vague times. So why didn't you ask again after you didn't hear from the mum again? Maybe she (the mum) forgot to invite you or the mail got lost or something else. Where I live, the mum to be is not supposed to know about the baby shower, so it absolutely could've been a stupid mistake somewhere in the planning. But I am also wondering, why she (your bf) didn't write you when she noticed you weren't at the shower. I would've asked either beforehand if someone told me you were busy or afterwards, at least a \"shame you couldn't make it!\". It seems you both lack some initiative here to keep this friendship alive - which is something that is needed when you don't have mutual hobbies/work where you meet anyway. And while I totally get that she has a lot on her plate while being pregnant, this seems to stretch over several months and I find it strange that you haven't really talked about it. How often do you talk? Did she say thanks for the present you sent per mail? ",
            "I'll use your own words,\n\n\"Dear Friend,\n\nA few months ago you asked me to be your baby\u2019s godmother - I was over the moon. Recently you reached out to me, and told me you have asked another friend to be the baby\u2019s godmother instead. I feel like I have been punched in the gut. I'm heartbroken.\n\nWe have been friends for years, talked almost daily, and we\u2019ve always been their for each other\u2019s big moments. So I know that you'll believe me when I say I would never want to force you into any decision you aren't happy with. I just want you to know I am sad that I\u2019m missing out and I'd really like to know why you changed your mind.\"",
            "Hey be a huge part of my child's life. Just kidding.\n\nAre you sure you are friends or are YOU her friend.",
            "Other people have responded with great advice on how to handle this. \n\nAs far as *why* she changed her mind... are you married? Is the other friend married? Some parents prefer for the godparents to be a married couple rather than a separate godmother and godfather who don't have a relationship with each other. \n\nThat still doesn't excuse the lack of a conversation. It could just be something your friend's husband cares about. \n\nI still think you should have a gentle conversation with her. Other replies give excellent advice on how to handle that. ",
            "> However now she\u2019s reached out to me, and told me that she has asked another friend (the same person who went to the baby shower) to be the baby\u2019s godmother, and that she only wants her child to have one. \n\nDid you ask her why she changed her mind? It's a very normal thing to ask as a follow up on her decision? There's nothing wrong with asking for an explanation. It gives you peace of mind and maybe you might not agree but it will create understanding. \n\n> Last month, she had her baby shower, and I only found out when I saw on Instagram a mutual friend [28F] who lives in the same city as me, had surprised her at the shower.\n\nWhen she reached out to you did you mention about not having received the invitation for the babyshower? \n\nI'm a bit lost..what have you said to your friend? She reached out to you, so how did you respond? Or haven't you at all said anything back? \n\n\n",
            "So sorry this happened. I can certainly understand why you would feel hurt, confused, and perhaps even a little betrayed. I don't know about you but this would hang over the relationship like a lead weight unless I understood why the change was made. If it were me, I would have to ask my friend. Since you've been friends for such a long time, and shared a lot of life experiences with each other, it shouldn't be difficult for you to bring it up although, it may feel awkward. I would honestly just say\"Friend, I don't want to bring up an uncomfortable topic but I really want to understand what happened. You originally ask me to be your baby's godmother and I was thrilled and honored. Now recently you've told me you changed your mind. I just want to understand if it was something I did? Why did you decide to make that change after asking me? \"\n\nI would try to do it in a way that won't automatically put her on the defensive, but really, you deserve an answer.\n\nAs an aside, are you married, do you have kids? Does this other woman? I ask because many people look at the God parents as the person they would want to raise their kid in the event of their demise. Perhaps,, if the other woman has a spouse and children , it may just be a question of family stability",
            "How does she know and is close to someone in your hometown when you meet online?  \n\nI'm sorry op and I've been hurt by \"friends\" by much less. Honestly, it sounds like she just doesn't want to be friends with you anymore. Sometimes there isn't a reason. And dropping people out of their lives is much easier for some than others  I've been there several times. You've been replaced and excluded.

I ask because I\u2019m curious if someone else did them and you got left out (possibly by accident) and she thought you were invited but never showed without explanation. Resulting in her being hurt and making this decision based off that? This could all be a very big misunderstanding. \nEither way, I think you should talk with her. Just tell her your respect her decision but you\u2019re not understanding why you were removed? Ask if you did something wrong to make her change her mind. \nI feel you certainly deserve an explanation.",
            "Be honest and just ask. I usually go with \"are you mad at me for something?\" It could be a lot of different reasons she did this some of which have next to nothing to do with you as a person , so it is always better just to ask rather than sort it out in your head. ",
            "You feel that you have been demoted in the relationship. When this happens to me, I also want to know what happened. but fear finding out. I would ask her what is going on. I am so sorry that you are going through this. Friendship is such a valuable thing and when it gets threatened we get upset. Good luck! And please keep us informed.",
            "I had a similar situation happen where one of my long distance best friends all of a sudden dropped me after like 5? years of friendship. Turns out she was feeling suffocated and overwhelmed by how much I depended on her for her company. I'm a pretty clingy person tbh.\n\nHer life was changing, she was exploring new social circles, and she wasn't the same person I'd become friends with when we were teenagers. I'd maybe take a step back to reflect and see if any of your behavior could have possibly pushed her away.",
            "I guess I'd wait just a little and see if Best Friend brings it up herself. She's got to be feeling the strain.\n\nIf the right moment comes along to bring it up, I'd open the conversation by asking something like, \" I really appreciated being asked to be Godmother and while I'm very sad to be replaced, I still care about you and Baby.\"\n\nBabies can have more than one godmother, btw. It's a really hard situation to be in, OP. It will take a lot of patience not to just blurt out something. ",
            "I feel like this stuff happens more late twenties and thirties. Moms. Pregnancies. Hormones. Less sleep. \n\nBe direct. Ask. You talk so talk to her. It\u2019ll sustain the open dialogue. Playing these guessing games is going to drain you of so much the next decade. ",

They\u2019re still aunt and uncle and the kids are called cousins, but it went really smoothly because we talked about it thoroughly. Sorry you\u2019re feeling hurt OP. I would just be frank with her and say \u201chey, I love whatever role you\u2019ll invite me to have in LOs life, I was just wondering what made you change your mind about the godparent decision.\u201d",

So why not just stop worrying about the label and just relate to them the way you want to relate to them? If you feel slighted or worry something is wrong with your friendship though then you should ask about that just to clear the air.",

If that's the case, then she owes it to her child to make that choice in her child's best interest. Your feelings have nothing to do with the choice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't owe you an explanation. It may be that her reasons would hurt you. She may feel like not telling you hurts you less than telling you. There may be all sorts of reasons she'd rather not talk to you about it.  \n\n\nThe above discomfort might be why you didn't get an invite to the shower. That part could have been handled better, but, this all sounds like a lot on the pregnant person to deal with, so, if you're really a friend, you should extend the grace needed to let it go.  \n\n\nIn my brief existence, I find that when I think I understand what motivates people, I'm wrong most of the time.",
            "1) do you still talk daily?\n2) if so, didn\u2019t you ask how planning  was going for it and say how you were excited to go?\n3) when you realized you weren\u2019t invited to the shower, you should have asked what happened? \n4) are you asking her about her pregnancy and showing your interest in it? Maybe you have been getting caught up in work and life and offended her? Not saying she should or shouldn\u2019t be, but being pregnant really messes with hormones and makes ones thought process differently. Maybe she feels hurt and this is her way of telling you, rather than being upfront. \n5) if my best friend was having a baby shower, I would be involved. Granted I live closer to my besties ( I have 4) at the very least I would be asking if I can do anything to help. And I work full time and am going to school twice a week to change careers, so I get being busy. \n6) maybe the other girl wasn\u2019t going to get an invite either because you both live so far away  but she reached out to ask when it was and surprised your pregnant friend. And when you didn\u2019t ask when it was and then didn\u2019t say anything about going to the shower, she was really hurt. ",
            "You'll be glad if you play it cool and just accept it. Heavily pregnant women have a lot going on on their plates, it sure doesn't sound like your friends social skills are at their peak at the moment. Say nothing, maybe let her know if she changes her mind again you remain happy to be the godmother. Your feelings are hurt but she doesn't need to know that, she has other stuff going on. I think you'll be happier with yourself if you say nothing and be happy for her.",
            "I mean ultimately you have to accept her decision because it's her and her husband's choice, but I'd definitely be hurt. I'd be tempted to say, \"Oh sorry, I didn't realize we were doing take-backs on this.... Is there a reason I'm being replaced?\" She has the right to 'replace' you but you also have the right to an explanation. If she cannot give it to you and if she cannot apologize for hurting your feelings then I think you need to reevaluate this friendship. What she did is still hurtful, regardless if it's her right to do it. I'm not saying cut her out entirely if that isn't what you want, but the whole thing (particularly not giving you any kind of explanation - just replacing you without cause) is pretty shitty.",
            "If it were me, I would probably just accept it. There are going to be other opportunities for you to be involved in this childs life. You can act as an auntie which is always fun because you can spoil them to pieces and still send them birthday cards, etc. \n\nThe other thing is that maybe she has grown closer to people who live near her and she doesnt  view this relationship as a super close one. As others have stated her husband might have had some input on the decision.\n\n\n",

In fact, it\u2019s possible she expected you, as the godmother, to throw the shower, and then was mad and lost faith in your ability to be a good godmother when instead you were all \u201cso when\u2019s the shower?\u201d Not saying that was right of her, but it\u2019s a possibility.",
            "I think that regardless of whether she meant to hurt you or not, having the title of \"godmother\" doesn't mean you can't love, be there for, and travel to visit this new little one. This shouldn't change at all about how you were going to feel about the little one at all, even without the title, that doesn't mean that you can be a hugely influential role in the rest of the kid's life.",
            "Nah, let it go. She is pregnant and likely has a lot on her plate. Explaining and justifying her decisions to a friend she sees once or twice a year should not be on her to do list. If you are a good friend you would have already considered that. \n\nJust accept that friendships change over time and get on with your life.",
            "Are you confident in your ability to teach religion and moral values? Because that is the responsibility of the Godparent.",

            "Hey, as someone with two children who has chosen godparents, and someone who is a godparent, I would recommend not confronting her. \n\nThe fact that she asks you means you were most likely her first choice. But in many families were being a godparent is taken very seriously, her husband would not only be involved but also both sets of grandparents. The reason is that for many families it\u2019s not just ceremonial , but legal. If they were to die you would become the sole guardian of their child and be responsible for it maybe insurance payouts help care for the child until they become an adult. I chose a friend to be the godparents of my child, but they were tough conversations with grandparents as to why we made our decision and legal documents drawn up in case something happened to us. I have a copy of legal documents in my safe at home in regards to a trust and insurance for the child I am godparent to. \n\nMy overall point is that this was probably a very difficult decision for her where she was one of many people making the decision. You should feel good that if it was just up to her she probably would\u2019ve chosen you. But confronting her or asking her questions will just make her feel awkward.",
            "It's her decision. Honestly, there's a moment to ask these things, and you know when that moment was? When she told you. It's too late to bring it up now... maybe it was a matter of being there for the child? The other friend lives locally, yes?"

In addition to our son, I also take care of our 4 year old niece -my husband's sister's daughter- on Fridays because she is a single mother and works full time. My husband volunteered me, but I was happy to do it because I work from home and she's a sweet girl. Plus it saves my sister-in-law money on daycare, so that's good, too. I originally agreed to do this because my husband works half-days on Friday, meaning he was home for the afternoon to help me out. Having two kids under 5 in the house is a handful, but I was able to handle the morning. \n\nWell, a month ago my husband told me his boss was upping his hours to work on a special project for the forseeable future. He would have to work an hour later on the weekdays and go back to full-days on Friday. This was a disappointment, but I didn't want to go put my sister-in-law in the tough position of trying to find and pay for a sitter on Fridays. So I figured I could handle the two kids, even if it would be tough. And I have. It's been difficult, I have to work later in the evenings because I don't get as much done in the day, but I've been managing it. \n\nLast Friday, I was at the grocery store with the kids. I saw my boss's wife and chatted to her for a bit. I made some comment about how much of a bummer it was how everyone was working more hours, and she looked confused. She said if that was happening her husband wasn't being a very good boss, because he was home every day like normal and working half Fridays. I ended the conversation and went home.\n\nThat night I asked my husband why if he was working more, his boss wasn't. He looked nervous and said that it was only for lower-level employees. I said that was bullshit and that he needed to tell me the truth. Turns out, he hasn't been working more. He's been going to hang out at a friend's house every day and on Friday afternoons he just does whatever the hell he wants. He said he needed a break from how busy we are with our son and on Fridays with our niece. \n\nI'm furious. First off, he lied to me. Secondly, he has left me alone to take care of *our* kid and *his* sister's kid, who he volunteered me to take care of! And I have absolutely no idea what to do. I told him he needs to be home at the correct time from now on, and he responded that he still \"needs his alone time\", and that the kids are \"too much.\" Fucking yeah, it's a lot of work, but I have to deal with it all on my own? I mean, am I being unreasonable here? I get that it's a lot, but I don't feel like that gives him the right to unilaterally decide he can have some time off. What do I do? \n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: My husband lied about working to get out of taking care of our son and niece. I'm furious and don't know how to handle the situation.",

He's responsible for all 3 meals and the house work. You'll be spending the mornings with the girls, and afternoons running errands. You'll be home when you feel like it.",

Watching your niece alone is obviously not working for you, because you're having to stretch *your* work hours. So let her know that because your husband is not helping you anymore, you can't watch her. \n\nIn terms of your marriage: I don't know if I, personally, could come back from something like this. If your husband had any remorse or had stopped lying to you on his own or SOMETHING, I might be able to forgive and move on. But he *still thinks he did no wrong*. He thinks he's *entitled to disrupt your job and your life and abandon his son and wife for his own childish desires.* As long as he feels that way, he is not a good husband or father.\n\nIf you do stay together, I think it is important to carve out some alone time for each of you and for *both* of you. but that's in the case you can get past this enormous betrayal and his refusal to give *you* any \"self time\", which I don't think will change.

Maybe not every day/week, and his alone time DEFINITELY shouldn't be when you're watching *his sister's child which he voluntold you to do*.

You need to focus on your own childcare needs, let her focus on hers. \n \n-- Everyone does need a break from time to time. So, make a childcare schedule with your husband that includes EQUAL time off for both of you.

He might not be interested in counseling, but if he's not willing to view his behavior as problematic and if he insists that you're simply making too much of things, then you're at a serious crossroads.\n\nIt'd be different if he came clean, apologized, and was willing to work with you to find a solution where you BOTH get alone time *as well as* date nights *together*.

Don't you also deserve a break? While I can't claim to know a mother's struggles, I've been a full time nanny for 2 under 2 and I know kids are a handful and exhausting. Everyone needs a break sometimes. But it's ridiculous for him to expect a break *every day* while you stay with the kids.\n\nI would sit down and calmly tell him that if he gets time off, so do you. I would propose that you can each have one day a week where you get to go do whatever for a few hours and the other person watches the kid. If you don't already, you should also see if setting up a date night without your son would be possible if someone is around to babysit, so that you can get a break together as well.\n\nIf he doesn't see why daily breaks and leaving you to do all the dirty work is unfair, then he's being extremely selfish. Relationships take honesty, communication, and compromise and right now he is failing on those fronts.

            "This is really awful.  I mean, you've been given really concrete evidence that your husband puts himself first - before you, before your child, before his sister.  Figuring out that trading off so that you both get much needed alone time really isn't rocket science.  I think it's the fact that he had such a deliberate plan that makes it so very terrible.  What he has done is so intentional, so callous, and I think that you have some tough choices to make.  ",
            "Reading this and your replies to comments, imo, your husband is scum. Contact a lawyer. Get rid of this lying deadbeat.",
            "You should stop the sister-in-law child care. Not because you are bitter but because it is now too much. You expected you husband to be around more. \nJust tell her it has become a too much. Lightened your load. \nThat is one burden you can remove. ",
            "Color me shocked that a much older guy was a bad husband to the way younger girl he married ",
            "Do you really even need to ask if you're being unreasonable? This relationship sounds like it's heading for divorce. \n\nIf I were in this situation with someone I otherwise loved and trusted, and the situation existed to to a lesser degree, I might try to work it out by creating a schedule where we both get alone time. Since you had luck working out your previous problem together, maybe this will even work for you... at least for the moment.\n\nBut considering the implications of his past emotional affair, your 10 year age difference (made worse that you were a teenager when you met) and the fact that his actions are so egregious (saddling you with his sister's kid while abandoning you to take secret holidays every week, keeping secrets, not giving you the full story even after being caught, wanting to continue despite the fact that you're upset), I think you could be much happier with a divorce. You're only 25 years old, yet you're with a man who completely disregards your wellbeing over his own. He thinks he's more important than you in your relationship, or that he deserves more, or that he works harder than you--all of these options are gross. Talk about a lack of empathy and understanding... It also sounds like he's either physically cheating on you or working his way up to it.\n\nIf this relationship exhibits as many red flags in real life as it does on paper, you should mentally prepare for divorce. Consult a lawyer and see what your options are. Don't be caught unaware during a tumultuous life event.\n\nObviously take this advice with a grain of salt, but your relationship sounds deeply dissatisfying. Seriously, are you happy with your relationship as it is now? Do you feel secure? Do some soul searching. Does he make you happy or do you feel \"stuck\"?  No family deserves a lackluster and unenthusiastic father and husband. \n\nI hope everything works out for you.",
            "I sort of maybe slightly had a ghost of sympathy for him when it was just your kid. Parenting is hard. But when you add another kid to the mix, basically so he can look good in front of family? No. Just no. \n\nContact your sister in law, tell her you can't have her kid anymore, tell her exactly what he's been doing. Then sit back and watch him try to justify his actions to someone whose opinion clearly matters to him more than yours. ",

            "My wife and I have two kids under three - she's a stay-at-home Mom.  I need my alone time too and coming home from a stressful day at work to a house with at least one child needing constant attention can be pretty tough.  \n\nBut not being *completely* self-involved, I realize that my wife probably needs her alone time FAR more than I do, and certainly she needs \"kid-free\" time more than me.  That's why I come home when I am done with work, and play with the kids and help get them bathed, put to bed, etc.  That's why I wake up when my wife nudges me so that I can change a crying baby's diaper at 2am, knowing that 4-5 minutes ain't half bad when she's up for 40 minutes to an hour at all hours feeding/consoling a teething baby sometimes.  \n\nThat's why I set up structured \"alone time\" like asking for golf lessons as gifts, where I can come home to say hey after work, change and go to the course - ONE night a week for a month.  That's also why I get her massage appointments so after 7, when her \"work day\" that stretches from 6am to 7pm much more often than it should ends, she can go do that with a friend and just reeeeelax for once.  \n\nAs a Dad who wishes he could be home more often during the day - the attitude this guy has is downright offensive to me, even though I also completely understand it - when you are a husband and a dad, you don't get to just choose yourself over your wife and kids and play the \"stressed out victim\" card.  That's just an abdication of those roles, plain and simple.\n\n",
            "His feelings matter and yours don't. He's tired of the kids and needs alone time - what about your alone-time? And he's had borderline cheating relationships before? He's probably doing that again.",
            "I would divorce.  It's one thing to want alone time. It's another to do it on your partner's shoulders... and it's awful to do it while they take care of someone from your side of family",
            "Marriage counseling ASAP. \n\nAnything you say will make him feel more guilty and will only have him lash out and get defensive, in turn making you only angrier and less willing to compromise.\n\nAlone time is extremely important in a marriage, but you both have to share it.",
            "Talk with him about setting up each other's alone time. You can have your time while he watches the kid(s), and he can have his time while you watch the kid(s). How do dinners happen in your household? If you make all of the dinners, tell him that if he insists on coming home an hour later each day, outside of your agreed upon alone time hours, then you will be making dinner for yourself and your child, and he can make his own dinner. Do you do his laundry? Stop doing his laundry as well, if he doesn't stick to the plan.\n\nHowever, it's unacceptable that he leaves you alone for a full day on Fridays with another child that he volunteered you watch for free, so his alone time and your alone time cannot be on Friday afternoons. If he still wants his Friday afternoon to himself, then tell him you'll be telling his sister that you can no longer watch her daughter because her brother decided he needed alone time. And then *actually do that* if he refuses to come home Friday afternoons.\n\nI mean, the whole thing is unacceptable and sketchy, but if you think your marriage still has a shot, then this seems to be a viable way forward.",

You mentioned he has done selfish things in the past and him suggesting you watch your niece without consulting you is one thing. Not knowing where he's been is another. Who the friend is is another? Him hiding this for awhile now is another. I believe you were meant to come across the bosses wife that day. Imagine if you hadn't, how long he would have kept up this lie. You should be having him take the kids as soon as he gets home and heading gout for a bit. Especially on Fridays he should be watching the kids by himself while you go out. ",
            "I have finished reading yet but as a mom to a toddler, I went ballistic for you after I got to the party where he was just hanging out at his friend's house. What the ever loving shit. How fucking dare he. He intentionally lied to get out of helping. \n\nSometimes I think that men don't understand that parenting is a full time job. And yes, that means that after you've worked 8-10, you still have to come home and help with your child. (My husband is amazing but he complains about how he needs a break. I'm like *NO ONE* GETS BREAKS ANYMORE. Not those kinds of breaks anyway.) It would be one thing for him to say, \"I need a couple of Fridays a month\" or \"would you mind if I took this Saturday to myself\". But for him to to just LIE?! WTF.\n\nEdit: it didn't really change after I kept reading. \nExcept for part in another comment, where you mention that he became an even bigger jerk when you went to counseling. His behavior is the kind of thing that would absolutely make me end a relationship. However, you all are married and you have a child together, so it does complicate things a bit. I would strongly encourage you to go to counseling on your own if you can. His attitude about this and then acting like it's not a big deal and he's just going to keep doing it because \"he needs his alone time\" would have me Furious. \n\nFirst, I think I would tell him that he has to call his sister and tell her she will need to make alternate arrangements, ASAP. Hopefully by next Friday. I would also send her message letting her know why. (If you think you can handle it and you want to do this for her, then you can, but you certainly aren't required to.) \n\nI would need the help of a professional to help me decide what the best choice would be for myself in that situation.\n\nAlso, PLEASE get yourself tested. I would also urge you to talk to a lawyer just in case to see what your options might be. \n\nI wish you luck. ",

Time to speak to a lawyer then two card him, offer him a card for couples counseling and a cared for a divorce lawyer, he can choose. If he chooses therapy you need to let him do the work (he probably won't cause hes w jerk) but it's important you don't do all the leg work for him.",

So I can understand someone having a NEED for alone time that is very real. (It's not quite as important as food, but it IS a need.)\n\nHOWEVER, your husband is seeing friends. That's not alone time!\n\nInstead of this being a fight, turn it into an opportunity. My recommendation would be for both of you to have SCHEDULED time alone (and/or with friends) and the OTHER person must watch the kids. Then you trade it off, back and forth, between you and your husband. This works well for ME, because even when I'm not having alone time, knowing that it's schedule (on the horizon) really helps me a lot.\n\nEDIT: Now reading other comments, I see there may have been an emotional affair in the past?

Its time for you guys to have the talk and be firm and see if you guys can agree something. Him hanging out with friends everyday is being unfair to you and your son. ",

            "If he's serious about being a husband, why don't you both take some parenting classes together? If he's not having an affair, it sounds like he's overwhelmed and avoiding his responsibilities. I'm sure there are support groups for parents that feel like they want to run away from their kids. \n\nAlso, I agree. Take a few hours every Saturday to go to the movies, see friends, get hair/nails done, etc.  He needs to bond with your kid and learn how to deal with them. ",

He/she met you when you were at a different life stage then them. Young teen/older teen, teenager/late 20 something, 20 something/50 something, etc.\n* 3. He/she is your first serious relationship.\n* 4. He/she has an affair within first 5 years of marriage.\n* 5. He/she pushes you to have children early (prior to 25 for most cultures) and child care mostly falls to you.\n* 6. He/she displays a stunning lack of maturity that only became apparent after marriage/child birth.\n* 7. He/she commits any kind of abuse (emotional/physical/mental) against you.\n* 8. He/she refuses an outside assistance with the relationship, particularly any that may disagree with their point of view.\n* 9. He/she attempts to control you. That includes: keeping you in the home with children, making you feel like you can't have friends, keeping a tight rein on money and spending.\n* 10. He/she considers their well being, opinion and self to be worth more than yours/your children's.\n\n\nLook, don't check these boxes on here where people can see but if he ticks most of the above, its time to go. Better to model no relationship then an unhealthy one for your son.\n\n\nI've seen your comments and I want to say one other thing: You can love him all you want but your love cannot make him a better person. Only he can do that. And as long as he has you and your son, where does he have incentive? He's got what he wants. If he lies to you or cheats on you, he just has to make some minor easily take back able compromises when caught. \n\n\nI wish you luck OP. ",

Honestly, he should be sorry enough that for the next month, he agrees to come straight home after work, and for a full half-day on Fridays, to watch BOTH kids while *you* go work at a coffee shop, get a massage, etc. You said you rarely get to go out to lunch more than twice a week, but he can go have his \"me\" time every work day? Then for at least a month, you should have \"me\" time every work day. \n\nAt the end of the month, he might have more of an appreciation for how selfish his actions are. A whole month where he only gets \"me\" time on weekends or, even better, when you do (i.e., \"I went grocery shopping for an hour. You watched the kid. That does NOT count as me time.

        "selftext": "My mom and my MIL threw me a surprise baby shower on Sunday and invited all of my family and most of my friends who are in my hometown. It was great, I don't usually get to see everyone when I visit so it was really nice to have them all there. My sister is also pregnant, she is 34 weeks and I am 36 weeks. My mom and I have been planning her baby shower with her that will be two weeks from now. \n\n\nAt the shower, everyone kept complimenting me on how tiny I am and how good I look and I could see my sister was getting really jealous. It was really upsetting her so I tried to change the topic but after the first little bit she retreated to a table in the corner with her friend looking incredibly angry. I tried to ignore it and we started playing shower games. Later, her friend asked if any of us knew where she was since she hadn't seen her in a while. Everyone was extremely worried because she wasn't answering her phone and we thought she could have gone into labor or fallen or something terrible. The shower was in a party room at an arena so it's a huge building and everyone there (~70 of us) began searching the entire place up and down looking for her. Many people got into their cars to drive around the area and the different routes to the hospital to see if they saw her car. We also called her husband to see if he had heard from her and he left work to help look. \n\n\nMy other sister found her sulking inside a timmies. She refused to come back to the shower because she was upset that she wasn't getting any attention and everyone was fawning over me. It took a while for everyone who left to get back and while we tried to carry on with the shower, the whole mood was soured and it was really awkward.\n\n\nI'm so upset with her now. I suspect once the baby comes I won't go down to my hometown as much and I won't get to see many of those people as often as I did before, so that was my last chance to get together with everyone before the baby.

And now whenever he touches me in any way in front of her she'll grumble and roll her eyes like she is upset that he is attracted to me or something. He dropped me off at the shower and when we were talking to friends he was standing behind me holding my belly and she said \"that's disgusting\" and made a gagging noise. She also won't show up to something unless someone has called her to ask where she is and tell her were waiting for her, it's a little game that she likes to play. I don't know what her problem is but I'm so sick of it. \n\n\nShe hasn't spoken to me since the incident and won't return my calls or texts but I think she owes me an apology.

My mom and my aunt think I just need to try to move past it because \"that's just how she is.\" My husband feels differently and he thinks I should stop doing anything for her because she continuously disrespects* us and our marriage. \n\n\n**tl;dr**: My very pregnant sister left my baby shower without telling anyone which made everyone worry and go searching for her, only to find her sulking because she wasn't getting attention.

It doesn't matter if \"that's just how she is\" it's not acceptable, and it sounds like it has happened repeatedly throughout the years.\n\nI agree with your husband. Clearly you try and try to do things for her and she's just going around playing games and trying to get everyone to focus on her even if it's not her event.

This is how you are. Shrug. \n\nThat said, it's unfair to your mom to make her spend more money than she expected on no notice. So I would still give her the money. You don't need to punish your mom.

Do not ever stop a party thrown in your honor to \"find\" a grown woman who has been missing for 30 minutes especially if she throws temper tantrums and seeks special attention at every turn. Don't ever let someone take a special (even a common) event from you like that. She can fuck off and so can anyone devoting more than 5 seconds of attention to her. \n\n2. Your mother and sister are your family and that is important. However, they are your childhood family they sound incredibly dramatic and disruptive to each other's life and your life. In your mom's case it seems to be reactionary to your sister's antics - a pattern of throwing attention at bullshit behavior that you're now falling into. You aren't obligated to participate in that. \n\n3. The only way to stop this from impacting you and your adult family's life is to limit interaction with them. You can try to reason with them, but they're both adults and dont have the right to negatively impact your life with poor behavior. It's all about choices and if your sister chooses to act like a child and your mother continues to thrive on it then you can choose to let them do it in their own little world. Your responsibility of a calm, loving, respectful family is to you, your husband, and your child(ren).

You will have children that will be first cousins of almost the same age. If it were me, I would want to encourage that cousin relationship for my child. How to do that while dealing with your overgrown toddler of a sister? Maybe the boundary is that you will communicate concerning the children and nothing else (like cordial divorced parents). I would read that to mean attending the shower. Maybe you start running things through your BIL if you're close enough. (Hi BIL, will Bobby be attending Sally's birthday party? Thanks, it starts at 3.) That way, you don't play into her attention game.\n\nJust think about it. Now that you're both becoming parents, I wouldn't be surprised if her antics even get worse.

At just the mention of Jane visiting her boyfriend, Beth ignored her for the entirety of a 9 hour drive home, then sulked in her room and around the house after they got back. *This was also during christmas break and was the first time our whole family had been able to be together for quite a while.* which definitely adds weight to the ridiculousness. We still don't really know what to make of it. \n\nSuppose it's possible that seeing her younger sister have a decently successful relationship (based on only the limited stuff she even knew about) is too frustrating because meanwhile, Beth's nearing 30 and the possibility of her own relationship not having a happy ending is too scary. I can get that reasoning, but there's got to be a healthier and less hurtful way to respond to those feelings. So that's why I find it so interesting! Ignoring family, or in your sister's case making a scene and *forcing* attention onto herself, is not a mature way to handle things, and is unfortunately not *healthy* for family relations. \n\nI suppose it might have been better to throw separate showers (and its still possible to do that, akwardness aside).  Having a baby, and the subsequent shower is a super special thing, and IMO as a [22M], is all about the mother and her baby. Showering^hehe them with gifts and stories and good vibes.

It's not an excuse for the way she responded to jealousy.\n\nOf course its easy to offer advice when I'm on the outside looking in, and I don't know what to make of my *own* sister's motives. \n\n\n\n**EDIT**     \n\n>My mom and I have been planning her baby shower with her that will be two weeks from now.\n\nDefinitely missed this, and assumed that a double shower was planned due to the close timing of the pregnancies.

This is their way of keeping the peace, the issue is that this totally enables the attention seeking; your sister *knows* she can pretty much get away with it.

I would finish arranging the shower, but I wouldn't go and I'd let that be the last thing I did for her until/ if she emotionally grows up. \n\nForget the apology, even if you got it, it won't change her drama queen ways. You texting her and calling her is feeding into the drama she wants to create. Stop giving her the attention she so desperately wants. \n\nSome people are just looking for trouble and drama. Don't play into her games. Be cordial when you see her at family events, but don't engage her or do any of her little drama games. Maybe your l lead will give others in your family the people push they need to handle her in a better way. \n\n",

It's the way they are because it has always worked! It can change, though!\n\nI 100% agree that you should pull out of her baby shower. How else is she even possibly going to start to learn her attitude isn't okay?\n\nOn another note, I like how you are helping plan her shower but not only did she not help plan yours, but technically you didn't even know you were going to have one. \n\nStop enabling her poor treatment of others (including yourself).",

If your mom still throws the shower, go, if only for the simple fact that it is to honor the baby not her.  Make sure all of your gifts are for the child, not her, and basically ignore her at the shower.  You are simply going so that when her child looks back through pictures from this day, you aren't missing from the party.  After its over, sever ties.  And if you didn't make it clear before shower, exactly why, do it.  And then stick to it.  You do not need that toxicity in your life, nor does your husband, and especially neither does your unborn child. And you need to talk to your mom about her enabling.  Saying   \"that's just how she is\"  is the most B.S,  excuse ever.  It's how she is because it's how she's been allowed to be.  It's time she grows up, especially since she's going to be a mom.

Anyone who has such gross disrespect for the mother-to-be at a shower, or the bride at her own wedding, or even something as simple as your husband showing you some affection should be cut out of your life for good. Everyone has tolerated(enabled) her behavior up to now. That really needs to end. I am saying this as someone with many sisters that I love. You need to dump this particular turd.",

Let's hope this baby will give her some real perspective on the important things in life. \n\nI agree with others, stop playing her game. \n\nShe was upset that *your* shower wasn't about *her*. That's pretty messed up. It honestly sounds like she's jealous of you. Your husband is affectionate. You're \"tiny\" while pregnant. Maybe she feels like her life isn't as good as yours \u2013 and maybe others \u2013 so she seeks attention to feel better about herself. She's really only making herself look worse. But with attention seekers, any attention is good attention.\n\nI don't think she is going to apologize to you. Sorry.

            "I too - at first - thought maybe that it was just her pregnant hormones making her a bit crazy (I myself got pretty weird whilst pregnant... thankfully I went back to normal after lol). But then as I finished your post, I've come to the conclusion that she's got a much bigger problem than just some out-of-whack hormones. I'm personally on the side of your husband; you owe her nothing, and it sounds like your mom and aunt are used to ignoring her behavior and they really need to stop. She's an adult, but she's certainly not acting like one. If she gets stubborn, just remain calm and polite, but don't let yourself feel bad about not wanting to pay for her baby shower. She does indeed owe you an apology.",
            "She sounds like a terrible human being, im.sorry you have to deal with it, she is probably really sad inside and needs everyone's attention. I think you should do the baby shower only if she apologizes and promises she wont pull this shit off again, including the shady Stuff you mentioned about your husband being affectionate with you. You should involve everyone in your family to let them know why you are doing this, if they are reasonable people they will understand. This will probably hurt your relationship a lot, i think it is understandable who is in the wrong but you need to be careful, it seems to me she is the kind of person that will try to turn everyone against you by victimizing herself, thats why i think you should talk to your family very openly about this, so if you 2 end up in bad terms, you have your family backing you up.",

            "Your sister is a manipulative and all around toxic person. It's one thing to get emotional from time to time but what you have described indicates repeat behavior. Your parents/relatives are obviously complicit with her behavior and are enabling it and you do not have to put up with that kind of behavior nor do you need to pay for her baby shower when she didn't contribute money to yours and ruined it by being a gigantic asswipe. If your relatives pressure you to pay for hers when they paid for yours, pay them back the money they used for yours and move on. Your family is shitty if they allow your sister to walk all over you like this. ",
            "Definitely back out if planning her shower. ",
            "Good lord. I agree with the other comments, this behavior is ridiculous. \n\nWhat really stands out to me is how fucking childish this is. \"I'm not the center of attention at *someone else's baby shower,* so I'm going to go sulk in a corner like a 5-year-old.\" Uh, hello? She's getting her own baby shower thrown for her in two fucking weeks, you said so yourself. And yet she has the nerve to act like that and be such a brat at *your* shower? Jesus. And she's even giving your the silent treatment--seriously, what is she, 5?\n\nLike, yes, okay sister, you're pregnant too. We get it. Being pregnant is a big deal and a significant life event. But that doesn't mean she needs to take away from your baby shower--that was *your* special event for you to have fun and do whatever you had planned and celebrate that you're having a child, and she had to go and make it all about her like a selfish brat. I know that's harsh, but this is an adult who is clearly acting like a petty child, which I find incredibly annoying.\n\nI agree with the suggestion to just stop putting up with this bullshit. Actually, if she's going to act like a child, treat her like one and don't invite her to your next party. If she's going to be such an attention-seeker, ignore her next time she throws a fit over not getting any attention. Let her throw her little tantrum all alone and maybe she'll realize it won't get her what she wants. I also think that ceasing all plans for her shower is not unfair. She acted like a brat at your special event and basically took it away from you, why should she get one of her own?",

Your sister seems to have some serious mental health issues that cause her to seek attention. It sucks but at the same time you shouldn't have to deal with it. \n\nCut communication with her, stop planning her baby shower, and make it clear to your family and mother that you will no longer stand for the way she acts and treats people/you. Don't try to reach out to her anymore. If she wants to apologize and mend things between you, she will reach out to you. \n\nTrust me, until your sister changes and see's why her behavior is unacceptable, you will not get any benefit from a relationship with her.

When you are riding those hormone swings you can make something an issue that really isn't an issue.\n\nI think you did wrong by causing everyone to search for her, she probably just needed to cry it out and have some alone time. You stopped your whole party. If I were her, I would have felt humiliated.

Sounds like you sister feels neglected. She's experiencing weird hormones too.\n\nIf everyone was complimenting me and ignoring my sister, I would have VOCALIZED the issue out loud, complimented my sister so she didn't feel left out instead of IGNORING IT (emotional neglect), and asked my guests to be more considerate of ALL the pregnant women in the room, not just myself.\n\nIn private, I would ask my sister to have the same consideration when her baby shower comes up in 2 weeks, so I don't feel left out either if a bunch of guests saturate her with compliments and ignore me."

We have a 10 year old girl, a 7 year old boy and a 5 year old girl.\n\nMy wife has a younger sister who is an absolute train wreck and basket case. She is 29 and has already been married and divorced twice. She has Borderline Personality disorder and is an alcoholic. She has two girls, 8 and 6, from her marriages (one from each). Both of her husbands were abusive losers to her and my nieces.\n\nThe first husband split as soon as she gave birth to niece #1 and no one ever saw or heard from him again.\nThe second husband is a drug addict who makes a hobby out of being unemployed so he doesn't have to pay child support.\n\nBecause of my Sister-in-Law's wild and crazy mood swings, suicide attempts, and alcoholism she lost custody of her daughters and my wife's parents, who are in their 60's, have been taking care of and raising them for 3 years now.\n\nMy wife and I visit her parents quite often and we are very close with them. We also see my nieces and they really are sweet girls although they do act out sometimes (though who could blame them?)\n\nRecently more family tragedy struck. My MIL has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer and will have to start radiation and chemotherapy immediately. My FIL has arthritis and is starting to lose his hearing and sight.\n\nThey recently approached us and asked if we would assume custody and raise my nieces, because they are just too old and sick to do it anymore. \n\nWhile my wife wanted to immediately say yes I asked if we could please have time to talk it over and discuss it, to which they graciously replied for us to take our time.\n\nNow while I genuinely love my nieces, and my heart breaks for their situation...I do NOT want to raise them! I'm breaking into a sweat and fighting off a panic attack just thinking about it.\n\nI have a full time job and three young and very needy children. My wife, bless her, is a very good mother, has a part time job to help supplement our income and is a wonderful and supportive partner, but she is ZERO help around the house.\n\nShe's terrible at keeping the house clean and is an awful cook, so after I come home from work, I have to cook dinner and make sure the house is tidy. I have my kids help out with the chores but of course they can only do so much.\n\nThen I have to spend time and play with my children, help with homework, etc. My wife helps them get ready for bed and reads to them while I do dishes.\n\nThen I have to make time for my wife.\n\nI am EXHAUSTED and OVERWHELMED. My weekends are spent cleaning inside and out and doing family activities.\n\nWhile my wife has promised to help with our neices, realistically I know a majority of the responsibility will fall to me.\n\nI can't handle more stress. I can't handle the chaos of TWO MORE young children who demand attention and time.\n\nI'm already spread thin spending time one on one with each of my children, how can I possibly give it to TWO MORE???\n\nThat's two more mouths to feed, two more children to clothe, shelter and provide for and educate, and we will be getting zero financial assistance from the dead beat SIL and her two ex husbands.\n\nThe thing is, my wife has no other siblings and I'm an only child. I don't think there is ANYONE else who can take these children. My in laws can no longer raise them. We are all that is left. The only other option is foster care.\n\nI would feel AWFUL putting my neices in foster care. But I just don't think I can do it. I feel completely paralyzed. I've already had two break downs over this decision (out of sight from my wife and children). I'm depressed, I have no appetite. I feel like a failure as a man, as a father and as a family member.\n\nI can't sacrifice my children's well being for my nieces. I won't be able to be a good father/uncle to my neices and I know I'll just be going through the motions with my own children if I take on anymore responsibility.\n\nBut I don't know how I'll live with myself if I let my nieces go into the system. I feel borderline suicidal by this point, but I'm trying to keep it together for the sake of everyone.\n\nI don't know what to do or think. Please help\n\n**TL;DR My in laws have been raising my two nieces because my SIL and her two exes deserve the worst parents ever award. My in laws are too old and sick to take care of them anymore and have asked my wife and I to take over. I already have 3 young children and a full time career and I just can't handle anymore. But if I don't take them, they'll have to go into foster care. I'm starting to feel depressed and suicidal over this decision and I need help.**\n\nEDIT: I sincerely appreciate all the replies. I'm reading all of them, and aside from one asshole, these are all wonderful suggestions. I feel more calm now reading these responses than I have ever since my in laws asked this of us. I'm going to take a day off work and just relax, go to a coffee shop and read a book. Then I'm going to have a talk with my wife about everything, and discuss options from there.\n\nIt may take awhile but I WILL post an update when I get a chance.

            "\nI think you need to tell your wife that she needs to step up more in the home if you are going to take care of these kids. \n\nAlso she needs to learn to cook, man! She's 33 and only working part time. There's no reason for her to not spend some time cleaning the house and doing some cooking. Lots of cooking is EASY and she can look up youtube videos. Shit, I'm 28 and just learned a better way to chop up onions and I eat onions like every damn day. \n\n Of course she doesn't mind the idea of taking on two more kids because so far she has it easy peasy with the three kids you already have. That's cool that she's a great mother, but you guys need to set up a real system that she needs to follow to help take some of the pressure off of you even if you DON'T end up taking care of these other kids.\n\nThink about the ideal situation here in your mind - even if your wife suddenly cooked dinner every night and kept the house clean, would you be willing to take on two more kids, or no? \n\nIt's okay to say no. This is a huge responsibility. \n\nBut if you do say yes, you have to have had a very in-depth conversation with your wife about your expectations of her first. \n\n",
            "A few thoughts which you may want to consider...\n\n1.  Your sister lost custody, your in-laws were granted guardianship.  So first, consult an attorney for the exact details... but if you take over guardianship of the girls via the foster system - you'd get paid by the state for their care.  \n\n2.  With the additional burden of two dependents, you may yourselves qualify for state aid like food stamps - thus freeing up a bit of cash for other necessities.\n\n3.  Get on Craigslist, in the \"Services > Household\" section, and hire yourself someone to come in and clean weekly.  These people offer their services for between $15-20/hour, and a decent one should be able to have your home sparkling in 3-4 hours.  \n\n4.  If you go through the system to take in your nieces, you'd also probably qualify for respite care.  That's where the girls go visit another foster family on some weekends... which would give you free time to relax, focus on just your three, etc.\n\n5.  Your kids aren't doing enough chores.  I tell you this as a mother who raised three kids... your kids aren't doing enough chores.  Every one of them should have a bunch of chores, even the youngest.  If you look online, there are an absolute TON of sites with lists of age-appropriate chores - USE THEM.\n\n6.  Stop making dinner when you come home from work.  There are hundreds of sites online that show you how to spend ONE DAY A MONTH prepping meals for an entire month's worth of dinners... and tons of those meals are crock-pot meals, where you dump them out of a freezer bag and into the crock pot before you leave for work in the morning, and you have a delicious dinner ready when you get home.  Cooking this way is cheaper, easier, and less stressful than whatever you are currently doing, GUARANTEED.  Your wife is probably smart enough to handle doing the actual grocery shopping for your \"day of cooking,\" so give her that part.  And get that woman involved in couponing.\n\nFinally... you're in a panic, because this is all so overwhelming.  Stop and take a breath.  Take another.  Now... stop REacting, and begin **researching** the things I've talked about here.  This situation isn't some insurmountable tragedy you can't handle... not when you step back and start looking at it through logic instead of emotion.  You have the tools to make this work - you've just got to realize it.\n\n",
            "No matter what you decide, your wife NEEDS to learn basic cleaning and cooking skills.  It's not rocket science.  The partner WITHOUT a full time job should do the majority of the work around the home.  No wonder the thought of even more mouths to feed and cleaning to do makes you break out in a sweat!",
            "It sounds as though you need to rebalance your home life anyway, so you  can use this as an opening to start discussions with your wife.\n\nYou can say \"If we have the children, you need to do more around the home...\"",
            "I'm in shock that your wife doesn't cook dinner or clean, considering she only works part time.  She needs to put in more effort, or more money by getting a full time so you can hire a nanny/cleaner.",
            "From the perspective of an eldest of 5 - \n\nOnce you get beyond 3, more kids isn't as much of a burden as it might appear.  Your nieces can probably wear hand-me-downs from your eldest.  Kids that age don't eat that much unless they've got some kind of weight problems. Provided they all get along, they'll probably play with each other more and demand less of your attention.  \n\nLike others have said, they can all help with chores.  We started our chores around 5 - helping with laundry, taking out the trash, picking up the yard.  At dinnertime the kids trusted with knives would make salad and the younger ones would make koolaid or set the table.  I started washing dishes when I was 9 or 10.\n\nAll this is assuming these girls are well-adjusted, which given the environment you describe them being raised in, they may not be.\n\nBut no, you should not be doing all of this by yourself.  You and your wife should be a team, and if she's not willing to pick up more slack around the house, maybe she should be looking for a better paying job so that you don't have to work as much.  And this needs to happen *regardless* of whether you decide to take your nieces on or not - you're burnt out and you can't continue like this for much longer.",
            "I just want to tell you a little story.\n\nMy sister and I were your nieces.  We were first taken in my an aunt and uncle who didn't have a clue what they were doing and probably didn't want us there.  We were treated like Cinderellas and felt unloved and out of place for our entire stay with that family.\n\nWe were then moved to another aunt and uncle.  They had three kids of their own, had just adopted another child, and took us in despite the challenges they knew they were facing.  They loved and cared for us like their very own-- chores, consequences, responsibilities, expectations, and all.  \n\nI still feel lucky to have those people in my life.  They are my family.  They saved me.\n\nIf you decide to take your nieces, make sure you are ready to do so with love.  They feel rejected enough as it is.  It will be hard and frustrating and your family will have a significant adjustment period.  But it can be done.",
            "If it is too much, it is too much. You are doing all you can to be a good husband,/a good father and a good family member. If all you can doesn't include fostering your nieces, don't blame yourself. You are giving all you have; no one can give more than that. \n\nThat being said:\n\n* On the financial level, the grand parents are currently assuming 100% of the expenses of child raising for your two nieces, possibly with some help from the state / system. Would they be able and willing to keep doing so in the future? Or at least to contribute in part by giving you a monthly child support check even if it is just 100$/month/girl? That as well as state help could help relieve some of the additional stress.\n\n* The grand parents are currently taking care of the girls 24/7. I understand they won't be able to keep doing so but if they live close enough, could a sort of shared custody arrangement be possible? Like if the girls spends Saturday day and night at their grandparents and maybe one evening a week? Or if they can take the 5 kids every now and then to get you some respite? Or just help a bit by baby sitting them one evening a week or by cooking some dinners for you? It might even make the transition easier for everyone if the kids have been living there full time for 3 years. \n\n* How soon do you need to make a decision? If your wife could show that she can step up for several month, then it might be easier to take the girls. \n\nIn short, is there a way for the full weigh of raising your nieces to not be shifted on you?",
            "OP what I don't see in the rest of the comments is help for you. You are going through a time with a huge amount of stress. Regardless of the decisions you make or the other actions you take, please take to someone who makes you feel safe if you are feeling suicidal or feel you are in crisis. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK) (US) has trained counselors ready to talk to you, even if you just want someone to talk to. They also have a web-based chat on their website.\nTake care of yourself OP! ",
            "Would it be possible for your wife to start working full time? This might enable one of the following:\n\na: You work part time, freeing up time for you to take care of household and parenting responsibilities.\n\nb: You continue working full time, but the extra money your wife earns can be used to pay for a house-cleaning service, so that you don't have to worry about household duties so much.\n\nI think option A would be the most preferable, but at least option B will be possible even if your wife does not earn enough money to enable you to work part time. ",
            "One major reason that you're feeling overwhelmed is because you're basically raising 3 1/2 children already. \n\nYour wife is not doing her share to keep the marriage/family functioning. Marriage is supposed to be an equal partnership, so if you're the one working full time and pull down most of the household income, then she needs to get more domestic, or start working full time to take the pressure off of you at work. Dude, you're paying most of the bills and doing the cooking and cleaning?!?! C'mon on man. You're basically her dad. Set some boundaries. ",
            "I'm so sorry you're in this position. I don't have any answers for you, because there is no right answer, you have to do what is best for your family and your own mental health. The one thing I can add to the information you're working with is that , if you're in the US, your in-laws, and potentially you, should be collecting money from the state to care for the SIL's children because they've been abandoned. The guardian is not eligible, the children are. They can receive food stamps, medicaid, and a monthly stipend to help with lodging, clothing, and incidental costs.    \n    \nSource, my sister has custody of her grandson. ",
            "No offense to your wife, but what the hell does she do if she works part time, doesn't cook or clean, and just puts them to bed?  Sounds pretty irresponsible for HER to make such a quick decision when she does so little.\n\nWill her parents help support the kids financially at all?",
            "As a child of a situation like that, I was taken in by my aunt and uncle and basically saved. They took on the burden of two more kids, myself and my brother. Luckily they had the finances to do so but they did sacrifice a lot of their own time. My father would cook everyday. We had a cleaning lady come once a week to help and of course we kids helped clean as well. Chores were a big part of my childhood. I assume because you need to be strict with so many kids. Kind of regimented. We came home from school watched pokemon turned off he tv did homework, had dinner, had an hour of reading time, had a fruit, a snack, brushed and went on bed. My parents free time was basically 9pm to midnight. They would sleep and get up go to work and do everything over again. \n\nDon't get me wrong im not saying OP should. I want to tell him the impact it had on me and And how grateful, how lucky I am because of it. \n\nMy parents were were drug addicts that cleaned up but passed away when I was 3. I was taken in by a highly educated aunt who works in the medical field and uncle who is a teacher. They valued education, pushed me to go to college, and because of that I have a great job in a field I want to be in. I've never even touched drugs in my life. If my parents hadn't passed away I don't know where my life would be, what kind person I would be, if I would have went to college or would have even had the opportunity. \n\nAgain, I'm not saying OP should. It only should be done if they can do it without as OP said endanger his children or even himself (your mental state is important in all these). If they can manage their finances with the extra children and can make the sacrifices that need to be made otherwise they may be better in foster care. \n\nPeople should not feel like they have to do something so life changing just because of family ties. I was taken in and in a much better situation because of it. If you think the situation created by taking in two more children would hurt your family then do NOT do it. I know it is a difficult situation but you and your wife know your limits. I am very grateful to have been taken in but I do not think I could do it myself. I'm sorry you are in this difficult situation and hope the best for your nieces. ",
            "I own a cleaning company. I'd be willing to give you a handbook of sorts to help your wife keep things in order. It's a matter of proper prioritization usually. Cleaning takes little skill. \nYou need to take these kids on if you can. Their future depends on it. ",
            "Cleaning is not an innate talent. It is learned. If someone is \"bad\" at it, they can learn to do better. No matter what, your wife needs to help around the house more.",
            "Where would the kids go, if not with you?\n\nI think these kids are going to move in with you. You and your wife need ot make a plan so both of you can get a break.\n\nWe only have two kids, but some things that my So and I do  that you should bring up with your wife:\n\n * Every morning and every day after school, one person takes the kids out for a walk. All the kids. I think this oculd work for you as well--that gives the other spouse 30 minutes at home alone with the kids.\n * Streamlined activity schedules for the kids. On Saturday, they have music lessons and sports. We don't do any other activities for them any other day of the week. When they're old enough to take themselves to their activities, they can have as many as they want, but for right now, the family is happier not rushing around.  \n * Chore schedule with kids that is rigorously enforced. My kids do the laundry once a week. Sure, they're incompetent (at 5 and 7), but they do it every Sunday - one light load and one dark load on cold, then hanging everything up. They also choose their own outfits the night before school. \n * Solid sleep schedule for you and wife, and maybe meditation in the morning for you. Download a well-reviewed meditation app and seriously try it -- before the kids get up every day, just try to do it to calm down and take care of yourself. \n * Give each kid $10 and take them to a thrift store for some shopping, then try some sewing and dying together. You guys will get most of your clothing and toys from thrift stores from now on -- your kids are young enough that they won't mind, as long as they have toys and clothes. \n * Meal plan. Sit down with your wife for a couple of hours every weekend, choose some meals with a cheap and healthy base (lentils, chickpeas, oats, brown rice), veg or fruit, and protein. Make a shopping list and go for it, prepping meals ahead of time. If your wife can't be bothered to do the cooking, have her take the kids out of the house for a few hours so you can do it without pulling your hair out. \n * Maid that comes once every week to do some of the heavy cleaning.\n * Send the 10 year old to a first aid course, so he can babysit once a week. You can pay him, and both you and your wife can get out of the house for a couple of hours to go to dinner. \n * We cut cable and went down to one car so we could afford: a weekly babysitter, camp every summer, and dance lessons just us once a week. Last year, the kids went away for a week, and this year they're going away for two. They love it, we love it, everybody's happy. Schedule a regular sitter / nanny that can come once a week, either all day or in the evening. \n\nI think you guys need to discuss a schedule where one night a week, she gets out of the house for two hours, and another night, you get out of the house for 2 hours. With myself and my SO, that's the only way we can do it without resentment -- when I'm at home and trying to get a break, the kids still find me. They're like devious little ninjas. \n",
            "As everyone has already said, you need to tell all these things to your wife, especially how you already feel overwhelmed with all the chores, and that you are already at a breaking point.  You need to tell her how much she needs to step up to take on all these new responsibilities, and you need to get a very good read on how much she is likely to do so.  It might help to put it all to her in a non-negative way, i.e. not just tell her she is not doing enough, but that you need her help and that without it you won't be able to make it.\n\nYou will need to hire help, at least for the chores.  Is there anyway to chase down the first husband of the SIL to get some alimony?\n\nThis is a horrible situation.  Take time to carefully think things through, as it may end up destroying your own family.  Here is yet another example of how irresponsible people end up indirectly causing so much grief and problems to others.\n",
            "Ok-its very easy to see why you are justifiably overwhelmed.  Take a few deep breathes and then it is time to have a VERY serious talk with your wife.\n\nYou don't say what her work schedule is but she AT A MINIMUM should be preparing the dinner and then cleaning up afterwards while you play with the kids.  Then you can switch off actually getting them tucked in and kissed. They should have their homework done well before you  get home form school\n\nHeres what the kids schedule should look like-School, come home afterwards and chill for a half hour-then its homework time and snack time.  While they are doing their homework at the kitchen table mom is doing dinner prep with 5 year old 'helping'.  AFter homework is over its time to do 5 MINUTE ROOM RESCUES for mom and the kids -check out flylady.com that tell you how to rescue a room in 5 minutes and how to teach kids to really contribute to this\n\nThen when you get home dinner prep should be finished while you play with kids-afer dinner kids are old enough to put on pjs on their own.  You and wife switch off dinner clean up and supervising getting the kids the rest of the way to bed (bathes  if needed and teeth)-kids should have next days clothiers laid out and backpacks packed.\n\nIf donner seems overwhelming for your wife she should do what my 18 year old did  for herself in her first college apartment (your wife is almost double her age so she can do it).  Monday is always some sort of pasta dish, Tuesday is Mexican, Wednesday is chicken, Thurs is a burger, Friday is soup and salad or sandwich\n\nThis is all assuming that your wife is working 25 plus hours M_F.  If she is working less than that she should also be getting all laundry done and the clueing while the kids are at school.\n\nTO some extent you have enabled your wife by not asking her to step up.  You have to have a very serious talk with her about how you cannot do all that you do anymore-make a list that breaks down everything that has to be done on a daily basis and another done on a weekly basis-go thru the list with her (there are tons of lists on line)-ask her to initial what she is willing to do .\n\nHold her gently accountable and be sure and praise her big time if she gets 90% of it done.\n\nYou are going to have to tell her and your in laws that you want to take the kids, but you absolutely cannot do it because you are currently stretched to the max.   your wife needs to demonstrate that she is going to step up and be a partner to you rather than an extra person you have to take care of.  Tell them ideally you would want a 6 month proving period for her but given the urgency of the situation you are willing to shorten it\n\nIn the meantime look in to the possibility of supporting the children but in your parents house-sending in a babysitter-letting your wife spend a night or two there a week (after she has gotten the house organized for her absence-all grocery shopping and laundry that will be needed in her abscense is done.  Are the kids being fostered by your parents-the state may provide support services in this situation?",
            "A bit late here but--the 2 girl's dads may be deadbeats, but maybe their parents (the girls' grandparents--the dads parents) aren't. I think you have to rule out if they are even aware they have a grandkid and if so, are they willing to take her in. ",

            "This post really hit home.  You remind me of my husband.  First we took in my 16 year old sister.  She's no longer here but now we have my 1 year old nephew with the option of making it permanent.  There is no one else to take my nephew and he's already been in the foster care system before.  \n\nI'd just like to say that your fears are understandable.  The stress and money of throwing kids into the mix, its substantial.  My husband has done wonderful. He works hard to provide for us, to keep things tidy, he even gave me 6 hours all to myself yesterday because I was getting so run down (having gone over three weeks since I'd just been alone). And yet, he is pretty much at 99% DONE...tired, stressed and with so much less personal time. With all that said...\n\nThe idea of us not taking in my nephew, given the circumstances, is extremely painful to me.  If my husband had said no, I would have felt very bitter.  Maybe that's not fair of me to say, since he's taking on the lions share, but its' true.  I do a wonderful job at nurturing the kids and being there for them and I do cook, but he does so much more than me.  I felt like it wasn't about obligation to take in the kids, it was because I felt like I needed to morally.\n\nSo, I guess what I want to do is throw out the idea that it is fair for you to say it's too much.  To be honest, we are barely surviving with my nephew here, we are so exhausted and strung thin on all aspects, especially financially.  It's affected our marriage (but we'll be ok, it's just hard).  BUT, if you do say no, it's also fair for you wife to feel upset.  \n\nOne thing I've really appreciated is the help we've got from friends and our church community.  We've even had friends approach us and let us know that if things dont' work out and he can't go back home, they'd be interested in adopting our nephew.  Don't discount the option of friends taking them in.  Do look into having them come to you as foster children.  I wish we could do this with my nephew but it's complicated by us being in a different state.  400 a month would pay for a house cleaner and all his food/clothing.  \n\nI know I'm rambling.  I'm tired:)  It's ok to say this is too much.  If you take them in, will you be able to handle it?  I'd say yes, but at a price, and you'll be the one paying that price.  you don't want to look back in 10 years with your marriage a wreck thinking \"it was all just too much, I wish I had focused more on my wife than on bringing in the other kids.\"  Just..... be patient if your wife is upset.  Also, I would suggest not being stoic when you talk to your wife.  Let your emotions show.  My husband is such a rock, that I know he's so serious when I can see emotion on his face.  Best of luck.",
            "Does your wife have ADHD or other executive functioning problems?  I'm an Aspie and I sound a lot like your wife.  I struggle very hard to keep up with daily stuff, but I've got this Momming stuff DOWN.  But when you say something like \"clean the kitchen today, please?\" I absolutely CANNOT seem to do the \"initiate, plan, do\" part of that.  It ends up in a meltdown nearly every time.\n\nThat said, I've been looking for a therapist that can help with executive functioning skills, and I strongly recommend you do so with your wife too.  Some people just do not learn them as kids, and it's important!  From the research I've done, a good cognitive behavioral therapist and possibly an ADHD coach can make a huge difference.  \n\nAlso, your 10 and 7 year old should be more than capable of helping with almost everything.  (Unless they, too, lack EF skills!)  I'd start by creating a chore chart and seeing what they can help with daily.  \n\nThat said, we had a similar issue last April, where our cousin lost custody of her three kids to the state, and we were the only responsible adults who could take them in.  We lasted 7 weeks.  Longest effing 7 weeks of my LIFE.  And yes, by the end, I was suicidal, my child was suffering, it was bad.  We did let the state take them.  It sucks, it's hard to do, and yes, there was guilt and crying.  But their foster mom (who's about to adopt them now!) is a really nice woman and far better equipped to handle their antics than we were.  Foster care isn't always a nightmare, and yes, your sanity and your children's happiness really do have to be the priority here.",
            "I don't know if you will read this but still...  I was raised by my aunt who already had had too two boys at home at the point. Now that I'm older, I know how overwhelmed she was and how in over her head. I also know that she *felt* like she had absolutely no other choice and that especially this though was very crushing. It's tough. Perfectly fine to be scared. Take a breath, talk to your wife. Relax. My aunt took almost a year before she could handle it. And I can tell you, that when you love the child it won't realise that money is tight or sometime like that. Just take your time to decide. Good luck! ",
            "Like many have probably already said, you and your wife need to sit down and have a long conversation. I mean one of those where you check your feelings at the door and talk no matter how unpleasant it is. You need to voice your concerns to her. You also need to take consideration of hers. \n\nOnce that part is done, review your finances. See if you can afford it. You'll also need to explore support from the state in your situation, as another commenter suggested. If you go through with this, your wife may still need to get a full time job of some type to offset unforeseen expenses and to make up the difference adding them may cost you in medical insurance payments.\n\nNext, I'd sit and have a conversation with your kids. This will affect them greatly. Let them know what is going on. Let them know that if they cousins do come to live with you all, you won't love or care for them any less.\n\nFinally consider this, what if something happened to you and your wife and your SIL was sane and stable. Would you want her to send our kids into foster care, if she was the only family able to care for them?\n\nThis is not an easy situation or decision. Think things through and try to make the best decisions for all involved, not just yourself.\n\nGOOD LUCK.",
            "When my parents died, my aunt took in all four of us in addition to her five kids.   She set us up on cleaning schedules, Saturday was chores day, we had a schedule for dishes and helped with the laundry.  It wasn't always easy but the choice between that and the foster system wasn't one my aunt would consider.  \n\nToday, our family is close.  We had a family reunion not long ago and with all of us, spouses and kids, it was huge.  Most of us went to university, have good jobs, good homes and good lives ...all of which began when our family chose to include us and not rely on the system.  \n\nYour call but I can tell you that it was worth it for us.

            "Who else could possibly take these children?  Your wife's parents can't, but is there someone else in the extended family?\n\nHow do these children get along with your children?\n\nOne thing I would ask is about the financials.  It is possible your in laws were receiving some extra social security for raising the girls and that money would go to you.  Are you in laws comfortable enough that they could pay for something like a twice a week cleaning service to help you out?  (Some else mentioned food stamps and getting a cleaning lady, but if your low income enough for food stamps, you don't have money for a cleaning lady).\n\nWhat about fully shifting some duty to your wife now?  If it isn't cooking, it could be something else.\n\nI don't foster care is going to solve your problem.  I think it is just as likely to tear your family apart as taking in these girls.",

When she wasn't working it was a lot easier but she's not a very good housekeeper -- stuff was always messy.  Now that she's working part-time it's even messier!  I've made the kids step up and do more chores and I do a lot of the dinner cooking.\n\nI'd take in two nieces in a heartbeat if I was in your situation. It's so tough having a lot of kids, but I know families with 5, 8, and 11 children.  It's completely possible!\n\nI get that deep down you don't want to do it. I think you need to consult a lawyer (have the in-laws pay) and get things done officially.  I'd also start thinking about life insurance when the MIL passes away and what to do with FIL.  \n\nYou've got a lot on your plate, but you can handle it. It's also a good opportunity to do a little reset with your life taking in two kids.

            "Regardless of this decision, you guys should spend some money to hire a cleaning service.  If you can afford it, which I hope you can. It seems really unfair to me that your wife won't do 70-80% of the cleaning with her schedule, but it's also clear that this is the way things run, so an easy out is just to pay someone to clean. Plus: don't try to go to every sporst game. Three kids with three to five weekend games?  God no. Organize carpools with the teams and attend the games where you drive.  And the championship game, if they make it.  I sincerely do not remember my parents ever being at my games - they went to many, but the second I arrived at the field/court I didn't need them or care about if they were there really.

I don't really have any suggestions other than coming to an agreement with your wife that if you do, that she really, really needs to help out more.  This is the kind of decision you can't make and then go back on.  You certainly can't take them in, just to give them up.  Is it possible to help the sister get her life on track and offer some support to her in some way?  ",

Fortunately, all the children are school ages so I think it would be highly beneficial if your wife started picking up more hours. Slowcooking is super easy and makes A TON of food, so it could make feeding everyone easier. I would also look into a cheap cleaning service and/or daycare.

If you are struggling or living paycheck to paycheck, I would recommend finding someone else to do it. If you have enough money to add two more, you need to try. I think a week is plenty of time to see possible problems (arguing when they don't get along with your kids/your rules). \n\nYou don't need a spotless house to have kids.

No excuse for her not doing the majority of this since she is only part time and you have a full time job. The decision is yours when it comes down to it. I really have no idea what you should do buddy. I wish you the best of luck though!",

I'm really sorry you are facing this stressful decision. \n\nI would like to offer my perspective as I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, also. For anyone who doesn't know, one of the major traits for this disorder is instability in interpersonal relationships. I am 28 years old, and have never been married and have no children. I have made it a point to live on the other side of the country from my family so that they I don't hurt them. I have had several suicide attempts and involuntary psych ward stays. My mind is hell and I wish and pray each day that I could be better, but it's hard to change your brain. I can't just pray my way to a healthy brain. I am guessing that your sister-in-law is experiencing a similar hell like what I am in because we share the same diagnosis. Where is she currently living? Is she in therapy? On medication? Is she still drinking? \n\nCould this sister in law move in with you and help you with housekeeping and take care of her kids there? Does she show any sign of wanting to change? \n\nI'm sorry to hear about your MIL and FIL's health. I can understand why they might need help with the child care. Is it possible to split time with them? Like, they take them after school, and you take them on the weekends? If you do take them full-time, is it possible that they could help out a bit financially with the children's care? \n\nI really feel for you and your family. I grew up dirt poor. Like, we lived in tents, then a pop-up trailer all through my childhood. But, family can be a really powerful thing- kids can bond together and help out around the house. I don't want to tell you what to do, but I hope you can keep the two extra kids. Maybe you need to sit down with your wife and have a very serious conversation- let her know that you want to add these kids to your family but she needs to change and help more if that happens. Be really serious and keep reminding her if she slacks off. \n\nI'm sorry you're under so much stress. I can tell you're really trying your best to be the best father and husband you can be. I wish you well and I hope you can post an update. Take care. \n",

I've at their houses and their mom walks in drunk yelling at them or their parents have never been around. \n\nIf you can, with the state' s monetary help take care of her kids. It's hard. You have your own life, you have three kids you work hard all day. Dig deep with your wife, if you think you can take care of them, even barely, and survive with your mind in tact, do it. \n\nA lot of ppl here might tell you it isn't your responsibility, they aren't your kids, you don't have to run yourself thin. Don't listen to them. If you can make do, do it. You will change these kids forever, you will improve the ENTIRE lives of these kids.

Part of your plan going forward is going to need to include being prepared with the appropriate services for your elderly inlaws so that you're not caring for them on top of your nieces and nuclear family. This is not insurmountable and I am not suggesting you do anything other than do a little research so you can offer advice (but not assistance) when necessary. I'm thinking specifically, shuttles to and from chemo, meals, etc. Someone unthread mentioned a church community. Maybe they have that?

By that, I mean tell them what is being asked of you, your concerns, and what you are willing to do for the children. There are programs for which your family will be eligible. It may be quite a lot of help considering the girls are not supported by either of their birth parents. It would be a foster placement, but you wouldn't be placing them with strangers. \n\nAlso, I'd have a heart-to-heart with your wife. People tend to withdraw when they are stressed and worried, but communicating your concerns is so important! When you don't it leads to resentment and inevitably, arguments. Unfortunately, I know from personal experience. Since your wife works part-time, I would use the \"divide and conquer\" plan. Split things up - even the meals. She should be able to learn a few recipes that are easy and filling. Some of our local supermarkets offer freezer meal classes and you go and make a few days worth of dinners, then just take home, freeze, and throw in the casserole dish or slow cooker. Maybe she could check into something like that?\n\nI do think you should take the girls, but only with outside help and with the cooperation of your wife.

            "I really do feel for you as I am in a similar situation as you are in. My nieces and nephew aren't getting the proper care they deserve from their parents. No one in the family can up and take care of the kids. So if the parents don't straighten themselves out, the kids will be placed in foster care. It really does break my heart. I am a college student. I am way too young to raise any kids. I would raise them in a heartbeat if I could because I love them so much. Here is where I am at in my thought process over this. If you have exhausted all options for them to stay in the family. As in no one else can take them on, and you really don't think its a good idea to take in a couple more children or you know you can't. Then here is what you should do. Accept that your sister in law made some mistakes, it is her fault she was a lousy parent and you shouldn't have to be deemed responsible for her kids. It's okay to think that way. Your home life doesn't sound stable enough for more children. Your wife doesn't help enough around the house making you do all the work. The cooking, the cleaning, chores that your kids don't do. There needs to be a balance of her helping out especially if you take in a couple more kids. I think in your case, if you can talk to your wife and discuss what you need from her, how you need her help. Then you can talk about taking in the kids if its something you think both of you could handle emotionally and financially. I wish you the best of luck and hope that your situation turns out positive. The kids don't deserve to go into foster care because they are innocent. But if it ends with being the only option, then I suggest that you pray for the best that they find a loving family who wants them and takes good care of them. It sucks and I am sorry you have to go through this. ",

Even if that's one night on one night off for cooking etc.  Try and split everything  up more evenly,  cook together for a while so she learns some basic techniques.  It really really is not that hard to follow instructions,  and thats all a recipe is,  step by step instructions.

            "Speaking as a guy with three children and a job whose wife became a full-time worker last year... yeah, dude, this sucks.\n\nObviously, your wife (and possibly your children) need to take on a bigger share of the housework than they are currently doing. The catch is that in the short term, this will be *even more* time-consuming than doing everything all by yourself. If for example one of your kids has never loaded the dishwasher before, you can\u2019t just say \u201cload the dishwasher\u201d; you have to show them what goes where, when something needs to be rinsed/scraped beforehand, what needs to be hand-washed, etc., and you\u2019ll be spending more time (at first) teaching and monitoring that job than you would have spent just loading the damn dishwasher by yourself.\n\nIf you are totally strapped for time already, some paid help, or maybe finding a relative or family friend to help, might be a useful thing in this transitional period. But the goal should be getting a more equitable distribution of labor in the house, not to reduce the load on yourself while your wife continues in her current state of inertia.\n\nAnd until this redistribution happens, you are in no shape to take on additional children.

Make these conditions specific, ie: in laws make 1 weekday and 1 weekend dinner for week and/or pick up the groceries.  Your wife starts making lunches every day and/or 2 dinners per week.

And maybe you have friends who would be prepared to act as aunts or uncles to all 5 kids and take them out occasionally and be there as extra adults they can talk to.

She has to step up with things around the house. The grandparents too can be a great resource as well. I'm assuming they live nearby so although they can't do they day to day stuff they might be able to step up on a Saturday night when you and the wife need some alone time. They also maybe able to help out with dinner a couple of times a week. I know it's really not in vogue anymore but crock pot meals are freaking awesome and will save you tons of time and clean up. Same goes for a grill if you have one. You may also be able to get some financial assistance from the state if the children are I your care. Another thing to think about is this doesn't have to be a forever thing. Someone needs to get the mom to fucking be a mom. Try to encourage her to seek the resources she needs to become who her kids need. Please don't count her out. She is still young and can get to where she needs to be. Don't fear this challenge step up, embrace it. I know it's easy for me to say that from the sidelines but these kids need family now more than ever. ",

My family was faced with a similar situation when I was 4 and my Aunt and Uncle asked if my parents could take in their 3 year old son while they were going through a tough time. My parents eventually said no because we were moving miles away to another country then and my mother was pregnant with her 3rd child. Within months of them asking us to take in their son, my uncle died. He drowned while drinking at Shuswap Lake, BC. His wife struggled to raise her son on her own, but she did but it was a big struggle. The son died from drug addiction about 10 years ago around age 40.

I was a horrible house keeper. Largely because I was lazy but also because I didn't really know what to do, how to do it and when. I am a procrastinator too. What I really needed was discipline and routine. I wanted to be a good wife and mother so I made myself a schedule. Monday, I cleaned (tidying from the weekend, dusting & floors), Tuesday was for laundry and any cleaning that still needed to be done, Wednesday was for grocery shopping, Thursday was a day for anything extra that needed to be done - shopping, maintenance etc., Friday was a quick clean for the weekend. Dishes were difficult to stay on top of for me - I tried but often they would be left for morning. My husband didn't like this and bought a dishwasher. This has been a good thing. I found it best to stay on top of messes by tidying daily. It is not fair that you do it all. My sister-in-law can't cook so my brother does it but she cleans up after. Every marriage has it's division of chores but it's not right that you do them all. She is capable. Everyone can improve. She just needs direction. And some training. Have her help you at first. Prep meals together. Do dishes together. Clean together. Maybe you'll find that this is enjoyable for both of you. Maybe she'll find some independence and find she is useful and work on her own. Perhaps there will be a certain meal she's really good at and can make it regularly even if most cooking is beyond her. Make this the deal if before you even consider taking on more kids. She has to help for 3 weeks consistently first (and continue obviously) but the 3 weeks will show her level of commitment and whether it can be done. Don't be a martyr.",

Unfortunately, the sacrifices and heart-ache do not end when the adoptive child(ren) reaches 18. History began to repeat itself with regard to one of the foster children, after becoming an adult, neglected her own children.\n     Keep in mind, it is not just adults that make a sacrifice when incorporating new members to a family. Your kids will too.

You might also be able to find an older mom/mentor for your wife in managing the household better and a teenaged mother's helper to pick up the slack on cleaning/laundry/childcare.

Please tell me that's a big fat \"YES.\"  Can they at least come over and help 2-3 days a week? \n\nWhy is your part-time working wife not taking care of the household?  Why have you not taken steps to end that fucking shit years ago?  \n\nWho's the legal guardian?  You shouldn't be the full time caregiver for kids you're not the legal guardian of.  For one thing, you won't be able to insure them properly, get governmental benefits they're entitled to, seek police intervention if deadbeat father shows up and wants them, etc.  \n\nFoster care seems like a terrible situation and should be avoided at all costs.  Those poor children.  Does no one in their family love them?  The reality is that the in-laws and your wife need to pitch in financially and physically and make some changes, and the transition needs to be smoothed out, with everyone pitching in to help.  \n\n",
            "So, essentially you're raising 4 kids, not 3 and a wife. Point that woman towards www.epicurious.com and show her where the cleaning supplies are. You need to sit her down and tell her to step up with the housework or those girls will go into foster care.

So I found myself in an odd place without no outlet.\n\nA few years ago after the death of my father I found I couldn't discuss things with either my mother or sister without them breaking down and crying.

People have already given great advice to talk with your wife about stepping up and looking into what financial resources might be available if you take in the child. I know people in my state who did receive SSI after their relatives lost custody and I hope this is the case for you.\n\nYour children are not too young to start helping around the house, particularly with making their own lunches and crockpotting dinner. I was washing and cleaning up around 7 and prepping dinner for my Mom to finish when I was around 10-11.  I fucked up some stuff, but there were no total disasters and I learned to make awesome casseroles.  Your kids may like helping pick out meals, etc.\n\nGood luck.

            "It's time for you to get your balls out of your wifes' purse and start being the man of the house.  Stop being a doormat.  Tell her you will accept those girls with your whole heart and they are welcome in your home, but only if she commits to being a better wife or you will end up in an early grave because of stress.  \n\nWhen your MIL and FIL pass on, those girls will get thrown into foster care and most likely will be separated.   I believe you can take these girls, but your wife has got to help.  She may be the type that you have to be very specific with her and give her a honey do list every morning.  Can she turn on a crock pot during the day?  If you give her specific things to do (wash 2 loads today, start dinner, clean the bathrooms, etc.) instead of pick up the place, she might be more responsive.  \n\nMy brother was a social worker for a very short time.  One of his cases involved 3 little girls, older than 4 but younger than 10 I think.  Their parents were drug addicts had been arrested for neglect.  The kids were taken away, but the court was very generous and the parents were given time to go to drug rehab and get themselves together.  The 3 girls went into foster care for a few months.  When my brother took them to court so the parents could regain custody, neither one of those fucking shit bag parents showed up.  The girls sat there and started crying.  The oldest looked up at my brother and said, \"What's going to happen to us now?  What is going to happen to us now?\" with tears streaming down her face.  It brings tears to my eyes just thinking about it.  \n\n Kids can sense a lot more than we think and there is nothing worse than being a kid and knowing you are a burden or aren't wanted.  If you do it begrudgingly, they're going to feel it.  Your resentment for taking them will be sensed by them.  Then it's gonna grow and your life will suck more than it does now.  \n\nYou can do this, but your wife HAS to help or it's going to be miserable for everyone.  If I were her and I wanted to take the kids, I would be doing everything I could to get you to say yes.  Maybe you need to stop being a doormat and letting her walk over you.  You deserve to be happy too and your stress level is too high.  You have to demand more of her or your stress is going to kill you.  If she won't commit to being a better wife, don't take them.  But your life will still be what it is.  Maybe this is the kick in the ass you both need.  Be a man, fucking own that shit!  Stand up to her and she will respect and love you even more. ",

            "I don't really have any advice to offer about your situation and hope you take time to think about things. A lot of people have given wonderful advice already. \n\nI just want to remind you of a few options legally w/ your nieces. I know this isn't the only reason holding you back, but you should be able to get medicaid, food stamps, and cash for the children, especially if you do this legally. The state LOVES relatives b/c it means less money for the state. \n\nAlso, even if you're the worst cook in the world, slow cooking is just awesome! They make huge portions (for a family of 5 or 7 or 9), there's little prep involved, and you basically just dump everything in there and let it go all night. If you don't have one, you should definitely try to get one! They aren't too expensive and really easy to clean! I am super lazy and have the slow cooker liners. At noon I'll be making chicken and wild rice soup for tonight. :-) I think your wife would be able to do a lot of the simple recipes, and if not, and I know this isn't ideal, you could prep everything the night before and set it out the morning of w/ a timer so it goes on at the proper time and is ready when you get home! There are some awesome blogs out there w/ make ahead freezer slow cooker meals too so you could do all the prep over the weekend and just pull it out the day of so it would be very easy for you! Then all you need is a side and some veggies and you're all set! And there are a lot of sides that can be done in a slow cooker too. /r/slowcooking is awesome! :) \n\nWhatever you decide will be right. You just need to be open and honest with everyone involved. ",
            "Your nieces need a stable home. I know it's difficult now and will be more so when you take them in but these are two lives in need of you and your wife. \n\nGame plan with your wife. She has to pull her weight in taking care of the house. Vacuuming the house is small but prepping meals the night before shouldn't be a problem. Might take some organization and some arguments but it's necessary prep work. ",
            "I don't know if I have a whole lot of advice for you, but I do not envy your situation and I just want to say I think you're doing the right thing by considering this carefully. It doesn't make you a bad person to want the best for your children and for everyone involved and it's hard to know what that is right now! \n\nYou would probably have to change your lifestyle if you took in the extra kids. Buying clothes secondhand, being more frugal with food, new toys would be a luxury, and your wife may have to find more work. It should be a careful consideration. \n\nOne other thing I came here to mention is that my own mother was a home maker while I was growing up, and while she was great at cleaning she is not and never has been a terribly great cook. I think... It's not the end of the world. She made a lot of simple casseroles (I jokingly call her food \"atomic housewife recipes\" because most things are from a can, as though we lived in a bomb shelter) but the food was edible and relatively healthy. I think that this should be a part of your discussion with your wife, having her do more of the cooking and cleaning. It is really easy to learn how to brown up some meat, toss in a jar of spaghetti sauce and boil some noodles, or stick some teriyaki sauce on chicken and plop it in the oven and do a couple steamer bags of vegetables with a box of rice a roni. Maybe you could ease into it, and trade off cooking responsibilities? The most important thing to remember is that you are a team. ",

It's the teenage years that will drive you insane. They may develop their mother's personality or substance abusive tendencies. Then what? Teenagers are hell. All these damn teenagers at one time would make me want to kill myself, seriously. You have to think about if you can cope during those years. Also, they will fight with your kids and your kids deserve time away from them...

You put her on an allowance, you take total control of the finances, and you get on her just like a Daddy. You come home and if that house isn't clean, you raise hell. You take her into the bedroom and get in her face and lecture her till she's just wretched.\n\nThis is some Old School advice, but it's the only way it will work. The 8 year old and the 10 year old can help out a little.\n\nLook, if I were you I'd have probably bailed a while ago, but you are clearly determined not to bail, so here are some things to consider:\n\n1.) Children do eventually grow up and move away.\n\n2.) Grandma and Grandpa can still baby-sit. A LOT.\n\n3.) If you take them, you should qualify for public assistance.\n\n4.) Your wife COULD do the housework and cooking, you have just allowed her to get away with not doing it.\n\n\nI'm not saying you SHOULD do this. I think your position is dreadful and I sympathize from the bottom of my heart. What I am saying is just, if you DO do it, you need to turn into a whip-cracking hard ass Take No Shit Stern Daddy, and run that household like it's a pirate ship and you are the Goddamned Captain, Goddamn it.
