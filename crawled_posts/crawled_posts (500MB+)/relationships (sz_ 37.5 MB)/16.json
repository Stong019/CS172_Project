        "selftext": "7 years ago when I [17M] was preparing for college at 17 I was trying to find scholarships.  I applied to a scholarship run by a local family using money from a man in the family who was very wealthy. They eventually announced that a girl from our town had won and I thought nothing of it.\n\nMy brother [27M] is now in AA and is \"making amends.\" He admitted to me that I won the contest.  He said that an old teacher of his was on the scholarship board and saw him at the store, and brought it up to him assuming we knew. But we didn't know as the letter hadn't come in the mail yet. But after she said something he knew, and when the letter came he took it.  \n\nHe was mad at me at the time (now he doesn't even remember why) and says that he responded to the letter thanking them but  telling them I had received a full ride scholarship to the school of my choice and no longer needed funding.  He gave them his own cell phone number and said they could call him with any questions.  He says they did and he just convinced them I didn't need the scholarship and they should give it to someone else, so they did.\n\nHe admits it was shitty of him but doesn't seem to think it was a big deal. He doesn't even see the value of the money lost because I still got to go to college, but the difference was that I ended up 40k in debt with student loans.  I still owe 35k and the interest is counting. The scholarship would have paid out a total of 45k over the course of my college education as long as I maintained minimum grades. \n\nHis prank cost me tens of thousands of dollars. I know he's in AA and the goal is to make amends and fix relationships, but this honestly makes me never want to see him again. I spent college SO incredibly stressed over money and this could have solved so much of it, and he did this over something he can't even remember now.\n\nWhere do I go from here? Am I \"supposed to\" let this go?  Sorry this is kind of a rant, I don't really know what I'm asking other than just general advice of how this should affect my relationship with him. I feel like I don't want any relationship with him at all now but I know I might regret that years down the road.\n   \n**tl;dr**:  My brother was mad at me and did something that caused me to lose tens of thousands of dollars. He's admitting it now as part of AA. How do I keep a relationship with him when I've never been more angry with someone in my life? Should I even try?",

            "What he did was awful, but what sticks out for me is that he doesn't seem to care how it's affected you, nor can he even remember what \"provoked\" him. Your brother owes you, in the very least, a real apology, one which acknowledges how his actions seriously affected you and your future. ",
            "He's not actually trying to make amends - that involves accepting the damage he caused.  He is still in denial and minimizing his behavior.\n\nDon't even consider forgiving him until he actually takes responsibility.  Send him back to his sponsor for further discussion.",
            "He didn't make amends. He got a fuck up off his chest. When you make amends, you take full responsibility for your actions and truly recognize and own up to the ramifications. Then you attempt to set it right. In your case, he'd at the very least contribute to paying off your loans. He followed his admission by rationalizing why it \"isn't a big deal.\" Worst 9th step ever. \n\nNo, he's not entitled to your forgiveness just because he fessed up. Making amends is not a full proof guarantee that you'll mend a relationship and I hope his sponsor went over that. If I were you, I'd be really pissed. I'd also tell him the only true amends he can make is to help with your debt if he can't take all of it. His recovery is pretty suspect.  It's up to you whether to forgive him or not. I don't think resentment is always the personally soul crushing experience it's made out to be, but it could be. If you can live with it, screw him. \n\n",
            "That's not a prank. That is freaking fraud with the intent on ruining your financial life. I'm in AA. Amends also end with how can I make this up to you? It's up to you what you want to do. I had 2 people say thanks but no thanks. I left them alone. One came back into my life and one did not. It's okay to cut him off. I would because he can't make it up to you.",
            "Your brother owes you $40K. That's the cost of his \"prank\". \n\nHe will not be able to return your time and compensate your stress. But he absolutely can repay you that $40K.",
            "That is going way too far. At 20, he knew what he was doing. I doubt he's ever lost a wink of sleep over it.",
            "There is absolutely a way he can make amends: he can pay off the student loans that his actions forced you to incur. \n\nIf he's unwilling/unable to do that, you are completely free to choose not to have a relationship with him for as long as you want. ",

            "I'm a recovering alcoholic/addict.\n\nThe step in question is Step 9: \"Made amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.\"\n\nThe key part here is the word \"amend\", which means to change, adjust so that something that was broken is made whole (or as whole as it can be). \n\nIf he's not intending to pay for your student loans (including interest), he really shouldn't have told you, because they it's just making the relationship worse. Not that it would have been OK not to tell you. My understanding of the program is such that he should be willing to pay you back. Even for lump sum amounts we who are recovering should be willing to pay interest, if we want to recover. \n\nHowever, at the end of the day we do step 9 for our own sake, not for that it others. I need to make amends, because if I don't, I'll drink, and if I drink, I'll die. I don't want to die, so I make amends. That's the logic. \n\nBut not all people in recovery treat their program the same way. Many cut corners or do just the bits they like. They end up relapsing.\n\nYou can not control your brother's behaviour, but you can tell you that you don't accept his amend until he's willing to pay you back the money. \n\nConsequences are good for recovering alcoholics, they keep us from wanting to drink again. Letting him off easy is not doing him any favours.",
            "It sounds like he apologized for himself, not you. And by all means, if you can't do it, you don't need to see him. If he can truly own up and take accountability, that would be one thing (that you still would have no obligation to continue a relationship with him), but it sounds like this apology was to make him feel better- not you. That's not what amends are all about. ",
            "Recovering addict here:\n\nMaking amends is difficult, and we are well aware that our amends may not be met with forgiveness.  There is nothing saying that you have to forgive him.  So don't think that you have to forgive him because he told you he was sorry.  That's up to you to decide.\n\nPart of the the amends are that he should be trying to pay you back, if he is in any shape to do so.  I wouldn't expect him to pay it all on the spot, but there could be some monthly payment worked out, even if it is small. \n",
            "How is he making amends if he is not sorry at all about costing you 40 grand?",
            "I'm at a loss for words how someone can go to such lengths to ruin their own brothers life and then go seven years without it ever weighing on their conscience. I also doubt this happened because of his alcoholism. You can't do what he did because of alcohol. This is something he did to ruin your life and it's got me so frustrated with humanity. I'm sitting here just trying to imagine myself in your position and I can't. ",
            "Great ideas in this thread:\n\n\u2022 Write to the scholarship board. See if you can recoup the money.\n\n\u2022 Talk to a lawyer, maybe police. See if you can make your brother pay for what he's stolen. Or, at the very least cover the remainder of your debt.\n\n\u2022 Your brother needs to see a psychotherapist, not just go to AA. What he did was calculated and clearheaded, obviously over the span of a few days. He purposely destroyed what he could of your life. That is not a prank. That's psychotic behavior.\n\n\u2022 Do not let him off easy. He did to you what someone's worst enemy wouldn't do. If he were a real brother, 2 hours after pulling the 'prank' he'd have guilt and would be running after the scholarship people to make sure you received it. Obviously he has no moral compass. I would not be around him ever again. He doesn't feel remorse over what he did to you. I'm pretty sure you'll be better off without him in the long term.\n\n\u2022 Be careful if you ever have to be around him. He obviously has something against you and is unhinged. I would not trust him.",
            "Making amends in AA isn't just fessing up and apologizing. It means trying to do whatever can be done to rectify the harm. So recovery-bro should be trying to make financial restitution to at least a small degree. If he isn't offering at least some money to make it right, his amends is bullshit. ",
            "What the actual fuck. If he isn't fucking prostrating himself at your feet and begging for forgiveness, acknowledging that he fucked you over at an astronomical level, and saying that he will pay back at least half your loan, then fuck that guy. I'm serious. I'd cut someone out over this. My God, it takes some kind of special to do something like this, admit it, then try to hand-wave it like it's no big deal.",
            "Sue him.",
            "Give yourself some distance for now.  What he did was shitty and he doesn't even sound remorseful, so he doesn't seem to get this \"make amends and fix relationships\" deal.  \n\nSo for now, distance and try not to sit too long on the issue.  As for long-term, it really depends on you whether you feel like you want to stay in a relationship with this person, blood ties aside.  Don't feel obligated one way or the other.",
            "Contact the family that gives out the scholarship and let them know they need to verify who they are speaking with. Maybe they'll feel bad and give you a retroactive scholarship to help with the debt.",
            "In my family, my uncle has stolen from my dad, my grandfather and convinced my grandmother to give him money under various suspicious circumstances which later contributed to her financial ruin. He is a master manipulator. I've seen him do it to a lot of people, manipulating free rent, keys to other people's houses (which he then promptly abused), not paying employees. You get the picture. He always promises to do this and that to fix the situation, but never follows through and leaves other people to clean up his bad decisions. I love him because he's my family, but I wouldn't trust him within 100 feet of any money or valuables I own. Unlike with romantic relationships, you can love your family, care for your family, and protect your family and still know they're a selfish POS. You're not required to trust them.\n\nAlso, having many family members and former romantic partners successfully complete AA (crazy uncle not being one), I can say that AA doesn't fix much unless you actually want to change. If you want to change, it can really turn your life around. But, going through the motions every Sunday is not the same as believing in God.\n\nSuing your brother might feel good, but it probably won't get your $50k back. I'd move on if I were you, but moving on doesn't mean you have to trust your brother or even have a relationship with him. You'd be pretty justified in never speaking to him again. Also, I'd tell your parents because they're eventually going to ask why you refuse to talk to your brother.",
            "He doesn't seem to regret it",
            "Sue him for his fraudulent action. He owes you 50k.\n\nMaybe he thinks to himself \"but I said 'sorry'\". Well it's not enough. Enough would be about 50k worth of 'sorry'. He should be paying you some of his paycheck until you've got the full 50k back. Until then just saying 'sorry' is not enough of an apology.",
            "His price of admittance into your life should equal or exceed 45 thousand dollars. ",
            "That's not something someone does in a fit of rage or in the heat of the moment. He not only took the letter, but responded to it and then fielded questions about it, too. Presumably over a few days. He had multiple opportunities to fix what he did, after cooling down and having time to think about it and still continued. That's pretty fucked.",
            "Hi, alcoholic here. I just want to clarify some things about amends. If I was your brother's sponsor, I would have told your brother not to tell you unless he planned on making financial amends to you. If your brother was making a proper amends to you he should have asked you \"how can I repair this damage I have caused you?\" And then, if you told him to pay your student loans; I would have told your brother he had to pay all of your student debt. He can do this in monthly installments of whatever he can afford until all of the debt was repaid. Your brother likely made this amends without guidance from his sponsor to selfishly alleviate his guilt and is, frankly, making a mockery of what amends are. When people do this selfish shit under the guise of \"making amends\" it hurts all of AA and worse of all it could potentially turn a suffering alcoholic away from the program. I just want to clarify that this brother is not acting in a way that is in accordance with AA teaching.\n\n\nI think you should tell your brother that he needs to pay your debt. Tell him that is the only way for him repair the damage done. Allow him to pay it in installments.",
            "Don't forgive him, for crying out loud.\n\nHe is cancer, a toxic piece of shit, he actually intentionally harmed his own brother.\nYour brother is a bad person. A flat out bad person. Cut him off and never contact him again. Beat his ass to if possible.\n\nFFS, you are 35k in debt because of him, and you are ctually thinking of forgiving him?\n\nps: the fact that someone asks for forgiveness, or is trying to make amends, does not mean you have to forgive him.\n",

            "When it comes down to it he stole 45 thousand dollars from you out of what was most likely jealousy.

            "If I were you I would cut him out of my life. It's not just the scale of how much money he cost you, it's the raw vindictiveness. He wasn't caught up in a moment of extreme anger, or suffer a lapse of judgement. The whole thing took place over the course of an extended period of time and it took some forethought to thoroughly screw you over like that. People like that don't change.",
            "I don't think I'm capable of forgiving someone who went out of their way to deliberately ruin my life, and succeeded. $40k in loans in no laughing matter. I'm happy he's in AA but blood relations are overrated and your brother has shown how much a trash he really is. I obviously don't know what the dynamics of the relationship between you two is but all things considered, given his shitty behavior,  I'd let everyone in family know and minimize all contacts with him and move on with my life. ",
            "Something similar happened to my sister too. Apparently she was granted full scholarship to the country's top premiere university but a family friend got his hand first on the letter when sister asked for a favor to check the results for her. This scumbag withheld the letter from her and sister assumed she wasn't accepted due to the absence of the letter. Scumbag only revealed weeks after the proper filing of formalities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, we can all move on from this but that scumbag's reputation is, for us, forever tainted. It stays with you.",

            "I would never forgive this, but that is just my feeling on the matter. \n\nNobody can really answer this but you.  Can you forgive him?  Or are you going to be filled with anger every time you see him for now on?\n\nEither way you go is fine. You would clearly be justified in either forgiving him or not. ",
            "Making real amends would be to repay you every penny. \n\nHe didn't \"prank\" you, he destroyed you financially. ",
            "Honestly, this amends is so far from actually amends that it's making me suspicious. Your brother sure seems to enjoy inflicting pain on others. This separate from the alcoholism, just his personality.\n\nI would first of all double check this:\n\n>He said that an old teacher of his was on the scholarship board and saw him at the store\n\nwith the teacher. Because honestly, the award seems local, so it seems strange that nobody would have ever talked to you about it afterwards in the sense of \"hey so you got another scholarship, which one was it\". \n\n>Where do I go from here?\n\nThis wasn't \"making amends\", even you put it in quotation marks, because it reeks not genuine. If it was true, the only reason he told you was to unburden himself. In the process he burdened you with regret, frustration and anger. Moreso, the way he did it was minimising (calling it a prank), and insincere. Not a big deal? Then he can make a loan and gift you 50 thou and he can figure out a way to pay it back himself.\n\nIf it's not true it can be something he made up to \"prank\" you or torture you. \n\n>I feel like I don't want any relationship with him at all now but I know I might regret that years down the road.\n\nWhy regret it? He's not a good person, and he's bad for you. He's still bad for you. ",
            "I believe there may actually be legal precedent for suing him for loss of a chance. I believe you might want to google \"tort recovery for loss of a chance\" and contact some lawyers. \n\nDo you have any way of contacting the scholarship donor and getting them to verify that you were, indeed, the recipient? Can you prove he did this? Try to get him on tape or get it in writing. Gather as much evidence as you can.",
            "Personally I would go to therapy and talk to someone about it. There have been times in my life where I felt like I was forced to forgive people for how they hurt me. That I didn't have an option but to forgive them because they apologized. I'm still angry and hurt and confused about some of those situations and I have been in therapy for a year and I feel like I am really starting to understand what forgiveness is. ",
            "Reading this made my blood pressure rise. There is very little he could have been mad at you for that would ever make up for this- and he's not even apologetic? This person is toxic. I would recommend seriously considering whether you keep him in your life. He was an adult at the time this happened- if I were you, I'd be frankly afraid that he'd try to pull something else like this if he wanted to. Be careful OP. ",

            "He doesn't remember why? Hmm.. I would like to take a guess and say that maybe he is jealous of your present scholastic achievement and/or your potential career after college. Does he have a loser streak or something? Was he in college at the time?",
            "Look - saying \"I fucked up your life 7 years ago and put you 40k in debt\" isn't making amends. Making amends actually requires that you both confess AND try to earn their forgiveness. Your brother is just paying you lip service to make himself feel better, so fuck him and the horse he rode in on. It's his responsibility to actually earn your forgiveness and you owe him jack shit.",
            "You have every right to be angry. What your brother did not only cost you a valuable scholarship, but it sounds like your emotional well being too. Thanks to your older brother's crappy behavior, you are stressed out because of the debt you have incurred. What also adds salt to the wound is that your brother doesn't even sound sincere in his apology. Honestly, his lack of regard to your outrage (because 40k in debt is no big deal) is appalling. If anything, such a blase attitude to your situation only shows your brother hasn't changed much at all. He is still just as selfish now as he was seven years ago.\n\nSomeone truly sorry would not only own up to their behavior, but would offer to do whatever it takes to make it up to you. If I were your brother, I would offer to assist you in paying off your debt. I would also write the scholarship board and tell them what I had done to you. See if I could get your scholarship money back or, at the very least, face the consequences for my actions. \n\nThe vibe I got from this post was that the brother was saying sorry just to say it. Sure, family is important, but your family should also have your back as well as truly care for you. Do I think you should forgive him? Yes, at some point. Do so not for his benefit but for yours. Anger, resentment, and bitterness will eat away at you. It will take away more of your happiness, which is giving your brother way too much power over you. With that said, forgiving your sibling doesn't necessarily mean having them in your life. You can forgive someone without allowing them to be near you or close to you as they once were. Your brother's betrayal (and lack of remorse) show he isn't worth being close to right now and, maybe, not ever.  \n\nBefore you decide to cut ties or not, you could talk to your brother one last time. Tell him exactly how you feel. Explain how his actions affected you; try to place him in your shoes. If he still doesn't get it, doesn't offer to truly make amends in any way, then decide if he is worth the stress or trouble of having around. Personally, if I were you and he blew this last chance I gave him, I would say goodbye. Someone who had so little regard for me (family or not) isn't someone I can trust, respect, or feel safe around. They'd be gone from my life, only allowed back in if they took the steps to show me they had changed. \n\nLastly, do not beat yourself up for feeling the anger you feel. What your brother did was outrageous, hurtful, and petty. It has cost you greatly. Furthermore, the point of AA is to grow as a person and to conquer your addictions, as well as how those addictions transform you for the worse. Your siblings lackluster apology shows he hasn't embraced AA at all or it's teachings, so don't let him being in AA make you feel as though your feelings are invalid. Be angry OP. It is a natural justified response, okay? You are in no way in the wrong for feeling as you do. \n\nTake care OP. I hope that things with your brother get resolved in a way that gives you the best peace of mind and closure possible. I also hope your brother changes his crappy attitude too. (If not, then I hope for karma. Lot's of karma).                               ",

You don't admit harms done and fucking leave it at that, you *make it right*.\n\nRepeat: an apology is *not* a 9th step amends. \n\nEDIT: Part of the reason I am a bit heated is that this guy is now the spokesman-by-proxy for AA to thousands of people.",

Holding on to resentment to someone isn't going to be good for yourself or your life, so accepting that this happened, grieving for it, and moving on with your life as it is now is the best course of action.  That's for dealing with your own emotional self. \n\n2. Similarly, wishing bad on others similarly isn't going to help the world at all. The world is going to be a better place if your brother's rehab is successful and he learns to forgives himself. For that reason I think acknowledging his attempts to make ammends is a good idea. \n\nYou can say something like 'Ok, thanks for telling me. The effect this had was [stress at college, etc]. I appreciate your efforts to improve yourself, and I hope that you telling me this has help that.'\n\nThat's for dealing with his emotional self. \n\n3. Whether you want to continue a relationship with him. \n\nYou don't have to. I imagine if I was in this situation, I would be mad, and not want to have much to do with him. You can hope that someone improves themself, while at the same time not wanting to have anything to do with them. So for sure - don't have a relationship with him if it's not going to good for you. \n\nThing is - you can always resume a relationships in five or ten years if you want. Eventually you might see that he's turned out to be a decent person and the kind of person you want to have a relationship, at which point you can start chatting. His journey of recovery is going to be a long one, and it doesn't need to start with you two being friends immediately. \n\nIf he does contact you when you're cutting him out, just communicate it clearly that you don't want a relationship with him: 'Look I appreciate that you've told me this as a means of making amends, and I think that was the right thing to do. But I don't want to have a relationship with you, please respect those boundaries'. \n\n\n\n",

The thief must make you whole again for there to even be a position of forgiveness.  \n\nThis guy, AA or not, is an awful person.  I would press charges, personally.",
            "Hey, long shot, but is there some way you (and your shitty, scumbag brother) can contact and meet face-to-face with the family awarding the scholarship, explain what happened, and see if they'd be willing to give you a partial (10k?), retroactive scholarship? It's terrible that this has happened to you, and you're still in debt years later, so it may well be possible that seeing what you've made of yourself even without their help, they will be able to provide a little further assistance.\n\nIn regards to your brother: it doesn't sound like he feels true remorse. I would let everyone around me know that he cost me $45k and years of stress. Even if he doesn't feel shame from his actions, at least you can publicly shame him... :(",
            "No, you are not \"supposed to\" forgive him. No, you don't have to ever see him again. But you don't have to make those decisions immediately if you don't want to.

            "I know it's your brother but that's completely fucked. That's no typical brother prank. It's obviously up to you but I wouldn't let him back in my life. Sometimes lines are crossed and there's no going back. Just because someone was an addict doesn't mean everything they did should be forgiven. I hate that mindset and what he did wasn't like \"Oh one time I took $20 out of your wallet\", he cost you $40k. Say some years down the road he pays it all back then maybe I'd consider forgiving it. But what he did is honestly just hard to wrap my head around. ",
            "I would sever ties with him. I know most redditors are about forgiveness in horrible situations but this is absolutely unforgivable to me. Your own brother drastically altered the course of your life to where it's almost certain your future would have been much more comfortable financially which effects so many personal life choices. And just like you had to reset your course in life because of his actions he now should have to alter his course in life to accept that he lost a brother because of what he did. ",
            "Make him confess it to your parents in front of you so you see he does it right. He wronged them too, denied them the fruit of their parenting labors. They made a kid who could win a scholarship then he took that accomplishment away.  How *good* and *relieved* would they have felt, sending you off with deal?\n\nThen never let him have anything to do with any family you build, he is a man to whom family obligation means very little and you can not trust him to deal fairly with your children.",
            "I certainly wouldn't know what to do.  40k+interest is a lot to heap on someone because you're pissed at them for a forgettable reason.  Addicts man, you can try to give them second, third, fourth, etc chances, but it would be silly to do so without keeping your guard up.  I don't know that I could ever trust an addict knowing what I know from previous experience.  He's sick, it doesn't make his actions right or excuse them, it's just kind of what you have to know and expect.",

How can he say that it was just something AT THE TIME he was mad at you over but probably over the course of weeks and/or months call/write these people telling them you didn't need the scholarship? He's an ass. You know what? I would say to him, \"well if you want to to fix yourself for what you did, start helping me make payments otherwise I don't want to have any contact with you for putting me into so much debt over something that was probably nothing to what you've done to me.\"",

            "Also, just remember the fact that he waited 7 YEARS to finally admit to you the truth, and only because it's a part of some shitty program with a low success rate. If this wasn't the case, he probably would have never told you.. Even his confession sounded like meager bullshit. Hate to break it to you, man, but your brother sounds like an awful person.",

            "He doesn't sound like he's sorry at all though- as OP said, their brother doesn't even see it as a big deal because OP still went to college. As someone 40k in the hole with student loans, that's a big chunk of my livelihood every month- a livelihood that I wouldn't have had without that education. \nI'm not really able to save money or anything right now, beyond feed myself and pay my bills. If someone told me that they cost me 45k but its cool because I still made it to college, I'd never speak to them again. \n\nHe's not even remorseful, he's just giving you lip service to get rid of his guilt. Fuck that noise. ",

I would beat the shit out of him, humiliate him and sue him for identity theft.",
            "There is a middle-ground, I suppose. I get that you don't want to regret anything later in life and I can tell you as someone who has just lost his brother that time does change things and you want no regrets.\n\nThat said, you don't have to throw your arms around him and forgive either. For now, it's enough to say you have decided to tolerate his existence in your life -no bridges burned -but he'll need to work for forgiveness. Also, you can inform him or not but you ought to keep him very much at arm's length. Not wiping him out of your family doesn't mean he gets trusted again. He has only earned your distrust -he'll have to pull some major rabbits out of a hat to change that. Personally, I'd be insisting he pay down your debt for you and if he refuses then feel free to cut him out of your life, if even for now. As I see it, it's entirely his fault and therefore entirely his responsibility IF he wants back in your life.\n\nOtherwise, then, it's time to cut him free because if he can't face what he's done and make it right then you have no relationship to mourn later.",
            "Jesus, that made me mad just reading about what your brother did. What he did was not a prank. It was an action he purposely took that cost you dearly both financially and mentally. Moreover, it doesn't even sound like he's trying to make it up to you. Sounds like he just wanted to get it off his chest and be done with it. \n\nYou're allowed to feel angry about it. Just give yourself some time before you decide that you don't want any relationship with him, because that is a serious an irreversible choice. ",
            "Let's tease apart some off the issues here.\n\n1. Emotional pain from the deception, malice, apparent lack of remorse.\n2. Financial cost of the episode.\n\nI think regarding 1 he probably does feel some remorse. But it's going to be very hard to come to terms with it whichever way. Consider taking a break from that relationship for a month or two so you can start to process it. You don't have to cut him out forever, nor do you have to forgive him completely now. Resist absolutes and extremes.\n\nRegarding 2, talk to your parents, assuming they are still alive. There is a good chance he can begin repaying you, or your parents may be able to front the money and he can owe them. They are not without responsibility - you were a minor and they failed to adequately protect you from the actions of your then-adult brother. If they don't have the money then they could agree to write into their will some sort of adjustment which can be removed if he does come up with the money one day.\n\nFinally I would suggest you write to the family now that you know, explain that someone acted fraudulently and that you would like to apologise for any problems it caused. There is a small chance they will still want to help you out, you never know. \n\nThe most straightforward thing might be to deal with the money side first, and work out the emotional side later. If you were to forgive him, that might lessen his and your parents sympathy about the debt. If you cut him out forever, they might be hardened towards you. \n\nGet a financial solution one way or another, then see how you feel.",
            "forgiveness something I have been struggling with lately as well, Internet friend you are not alone. I hope some things I've been telling myself lately can help you too.\n\nSome people do not deserve forgiveness nor are all actions inherently forgivable. I've found that some people believe if you say the words \"I'm sorry\" that it magically erases people's memory or events that have happened in the past.  It's infuriating, so please remember you do not owe anyone your forgiveness just because they ask for it. Sorry is an action word. \n\nYour life has been dramatically changed because of his decision, and his apathy towards it's effects on you really only indicates that he needs to confront the situation to clear his guilty conscience, not that he feels remorse for the damages he has done to your life and your relationship. \n\nIf this were a stranger I'd say lawyer up and cut ties. But this is your brother. Everyone treats family things like this differently so it's really your decision on how to proceed. My advice is to sit him down and tell him exactly how much that one silly 'prank' changed your life.  Don't call. Don't text. He needs to see how angry you are.  Look him in the eye- he needs to see the trust he's betrayed in you. he needs to know that what he did has changed your relationship and you need time to think about what happened.  Don't set anything in stone.  Like you said you don't want to make a decision you regret, maybe with some time you won't feel as angry... \n\nwho knows!  Everything happens for a reason. Maybe things really take off for you and it's because you went to your college and not the scholarship one... \n\nI digress, my point is its ok to forgive but don't let people make you feel bad if you chose not to. I would take time and cool off and play it by ear. ",
            "I can't imagine ever forgiving somebody for that kind of action towards me. It goes beyond being a prank.\n\nI've stopped talking to a certain family member for much less so I think you'd be more than reasonable to never talk to him again.",

            "So since he is truly remorseful he is heking with your repayments? Otherwise he isn't owning his mistakes.",
            "It is completely up to you what kind of relationship, if any, you want to have with your brother. So though I can't tell you what to do next, I do have some things I would consider:\n\n- Would you call an attempt to hurt someone out of anger a prank? Especially your own sibling?\n\n- He's known the truth this whole time. You on the other hand just found out. It's new information and new emotion you're feeling. That's okay, and it's fair for you to take the time to process what he did. \n\n- Just because he apologized does not mean you owe him forgiveness. ",
            "So what is his plan for the very important \"make amends\" part? Is he playing you back the money? ",
            "Your brother may have had issues with alcohol. But that does not in any way diminish your feelings or the loss you faced or the financial burden you are facing right now.\n\nYou can choose to forgive him but don't let his alcohol abuse guilt you into it.",
            "Just because someone's related to you, that doesn't mean they're family man.",
            "In AA meetings they often stress that not all you amends will be forgiven. This is one of those cases. tell him you don't forgive him and this honestly was a big fuck up. Then he'll talk to his sponsor and to the group, trying to get advice. Hopefully, they give him advice and he makes it up to you somehow.  ",
            "If it were me, I would end the relationship. I would never be able to think of him as family. Spending time with him would just make me feel worse. \n\nHe certainly doesn't deserve your time. You are not supposed to let this go.",
            "Everyone telling you he should pay you back is correct. He should at least try to pay some of it back. The real question is, if you don't forgive him, how bad will it eat at you? It's harder to live with rage inside of you then to let it go. Will you be more at peace and live an easier life if you do forgive him? Sometimes forgiving someone isn't just about what it does for them, but what it also does foe you.\n",

            "I think it would be best for you to not talk to your brother for now. He needs to realize that his actions drastically affected your life and well being for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis doesn't mean that you don't need to talk to him forever, life isn't black and white. I say take the time to settle your thoughts on this. Learn to accept that it happened and move on. Once you've gotten over the shock you can reevaluate whether or not you would like to rekindle your relationship with him.\n\nI don't know how I would even carry on a relationship with someone who did something like that to me: What positive interactions could I have with such a person?\n\nA good question to ask yourself is: If this person wasn't someone I knew, I was meeting them for the first time and they did this, would I be their friend? The answer is -CERTAINLY NOT. The point is that just because someone is family doesn't mean they get to do horrible things to you and then have you accept an apology whilly nilly.\n\nI've let go of my relationship with my Mother for now because she tried to tell police my husband hit her and almost had him arrested. Luckily there were tons of witnesses that dismissed her claim as he wasn't even near her and there were no marks on her at all... She told me she just doesn't think he's right for me. I've been with him for 15 years and she wants to ruin my life by taking him away from me?? She wants to ruin an innocent mans life by getting him a criminal record just because she doesn't want him with me?? NO THANK YOU.\n\nI will speak to her again some day (like if she gets really sick) but for now I have nothing positive to say to her so I won't say anything at all. I still love her and don't want anything bad to happen to her but I just can't right now.\n\nLong story short: I think you should take a break from your brother for now. I can't imagine you could have any positive interaction with him without this sitting in the back of your mind.",

My grandmother never went to the funeral or spoke with the remaining members of her sister's family (both of their parents are dead). My grandmother is still upset she never tried to rebuild the relationship and I can tell it has a large impact on her emotional health. From this, I would say that you should try to forgive him and move on. It may take a long time, but you're still young, things will change. If he continues to pull shit like that, then I say cut him out. I have examples of this side as well, and sometimes it's better to burn the bridge and move on. But seeing as how he is trying to mend the relationships he's damaged, I think you're better off trying to work through it OP.

            "Right, I know people here are asking for blood but...\n\n....he is your brother.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean everything. You don't have to forgive him. What he did was REALLY REALLY REALLY shitty. To make that clear.\n\nBut, if I were in your place, I would give him a very thin chance. If you just had randomly learned what he did, I would have said cut off relations. Right now, he willingly admitted something he didn't have to. It hurts and, to repeat, what he did was extremely shitty, but the fact that he told you about it means he at least truthfully regrets it.\n\nGive him a chance to prove himself. If he fails in any meaningful way, cut him off.\n\nYou lost that scholarship and it isn't coming back by cutting him off now. Maybe you don't need to lose a brother too.",
            "Listen, I have a big long story that I am sure that someone could find in my comment history if they searched for it, but it basically says that after my parents split my mother took our two dogs who were indoor/outdoor dogs and made them just outdoor dogs under what were beyond deplorable conditions. One dog died in a pile of his own filth... well actually I had to be flown in to get him to the vet so he could be humanly killed and not die in a pile of his own filth.\n\nAnd everyone just forgot about it.\n\nEveryone deserves forgiveness but some people gotta earn it first.

            "Oh my god. I can't believe how many people are telling you to make him pay you back. I mean I'm not in your situation, I don't know your brother, I don't know your life. But I'll try to give you some advice since you've posted your problem on reddit.\n\nI think it's really shitty that this happened between you and your brother. Family stuff is always tricky because no matter how little you like them, you're kinda forced to love them still or at the very least have a relationship with them.\n\nI also think you have every right to be angry about what your brother did. I think that you might never forgive him. You don't have to. You do have the power to choose how you feel about all this though. It's always good to keep an open mind and give people second chances. It helps them become better, and it makes you feel good. \n\nOf course, you also need to protect yourself, and you shouldn't deal with bullshit.\n\nI'd suggest you let your feelings out, talk to someone about how upset you are, someone that is a good listener and can sympathize but not get too emotional about it. Maybe even talk to a therapist. Then, if you think you're ready, talk to your brother. Tell him that you're pretty upset about what he did, and you don't know if you'll ever be able to forgive him. But you appreciate that he's trying to make a change in his life and you wish him luck. That's all you can do.\n\nI'm sorry about your $40k loss. It does suck. I hope somehow you are able to find the silver lining of it. I hope someday your brother does something to try to repay you. Good luck.",
            "On the other hand, while he did something incredibly shitty to you it probably was just as life changing to the person who ended up getting the scholarship. You still went to college, graduated and got your life on track and someone else, who may not have been able to succeed without the scholarship, had the chance.\n\nIt still sucks but it's not like he stole $50k from you and burned it. He stole $50k from you and gave it to someone else who may have needed it more.",
            "Honey I'm so sorry for this mess! After I lived in Thailand where people frequently say non-truths to maintain harmony, I started to question the value of strict honesty, and stories like this make me question the value of delayed honesty without remorse! \nCan your brother contact the scholarship folks and appeal for a  retroactive scholarship for you? Could he do a kickstarter campaign for you? Making amends is not the same as verbal diarrhea. In order to take responsibility for his actions, he needs to right this wrong. ",

        "selftext": "Since we met my boyfriend has been on and off of tinder, I\u2019ve been very clear that it hurts me but he always defended it as just him \u2018wanting an ego boost\u2019. A few months ago we had a major argument about it where I threatened to leave and I honestly thought that was going to be the end of it. Pretty naive, really. Also I should note his ex before me left him for this very reason- I feel like an idiot for thinking he\u2019d ever change.\n\nToday I woke up and realised he\u2019d been using my phone and his email was logged in. I noticed he\u2019d gotten an email from an app called hinge- just to give you an idea of the kind of app this is, the description read: \u2018the app that was designed to be deleted\u2019. Great. My stomach instantly dropped. I logged into it with his phone number and he\u2019s put up profile pictures of him that I\u2019ve taken when we\u2019ve been on days out together?! In his description he\u2019s got things like \u2018we\u2019ll get along if you like Chinese and have a dog, if you\u2019re silly and comfortable and over share\u2019. He\u2019s also put in as a strict preference that he wants to be matched with hindus/muslims only. I\u2019m white british.\n\nI knew something was going on yesterday but wasn\u2019t sure what, he was acting differently and it was making me so anxious. He had the nerve to tell me that I must just be hormonal? I think the worst part about it is his reaction to all of this- he heard me crying, acted concerned and then saw me with his phone, at which point he just took it from me and went back to bed. That was about an hour ago and the only interaction I\u2019ve had with him since was him asking me to open the bathroom door... not to see if I was okay, but because he needed to pee. This post sounds like a joke at this point.\n\nI\u2019m obviously hurt by the fact that he\u2019s on this thing but I think I\u2019m more shocked by his total lack of guilt or response to me being upset. I\u2019m so angry and there\u2019s nothing I can do with it- I\u2019m so embarrassed about the situation I don\u2019t want to tell my family/friends how he\u2019s treated me, and I can\u2019t even talk to him about it because he\u2019s refusing to address anything\u2019s wrong, he\u2019s still in bed. I don\u2019t know what to do. He\u2019s brought my self esteem down so much that I feel like I can\u2019t be without him, but I know i can\u2019t stay in this situation. Should I even bother trying to talk to him or should I just leave? I\u2019ve taken screenshots of everything and initially I was going to send them to his family but thought against it. The thing is, if I just leave there\u2019s literally zero consequences for him. He gets what he wants, he gets the freedom to go on random dates with no guilt. It just seems so fucking unfair that I\u2019m the one left heartbroken and he gets to party up.\n\nI know the majority of replies are going to tell me to leave, and I can\u2019t argue with you there. But how do I quell this need for closure/revenge?\n\nTLDR: caught my boyfriend of three years on another dating app, he\u2019s refusing to even acknowledge the fact that I\u2019m upset. Don\u2019t know what to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit-**UPDATE:** So within the hour after I'd initially written this post I got myself and my stuff together, packed it in my car and left. It felt impossible, there was a lot of stuff and I was a wreck but I managed it in the end. Throughout the whole time, he was just in bed pretending to sleep, which made me angry more than anything. I felt like he couldn't care less. We'd been living together for two years but fortunately, in September I'd decided to get my own student apartment- obviously, I knew then that things weren't going well and thank god I made that decision because now I have a place to stay. Whilst I was sat on the driveway in my car ready to leave I got a text from him saying 'I'm not going to insult you by asking you to stay or to come back but could you please leave the keys to the house'. I had already left them, but that last dig at me made me so mad and hurt. No apology, no goodbye just 'leave the keys'. I guess that's my closure. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo currently I'm just sitting in bed with my stuff all around me in bags reading through these comments, and have been for the last couple of hours. Thank you for the support, even the comments that were harsh I greatly appreciate- it just gave me a wake-up call and a kick up the ass to sort my life out. I'm sad that this shitshow of a relationship has come to an end, angry that it happened the way it did- but funnily enough, I'm relieved. I can do what I want now and get on top of my self-esteem issues. I'm driving down to see my mum and the rest of the family tomorrow, I haven't seen them since Christmas and I absolutely cannot wait. The anger's still there, but I'm just going to get on with things. I absolutely cannot waste any more energy on that guy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice for my newly single life/getting him out of my head?",

He isn't worth another single second. Life is too short. \n\nI'm sorry anyone would treat you like that. It is completely detestable what he did to you. You are worth so much more.

            "Dating apps are for dating and hooking up.\n\nIf he isn't actively looking for people to fuck, he's at the least using the app as a field to let his imagination run free--visualizing worlds of possibility of being with all these other women. \n\nThat's cognitive power spent on fantasy and not imagining the future with YOU.",
            "People are giving you flack for the revenge comment, but in think those of us that have been in similar situation get the feeling.\n\nRevenge is knowing that he\u2019s always going to be like this - he\u2019s always going to hurt himself. He going to push away good woman after good woman, he\u2019ll either die alone, or end up in some train wreck of a relationship.\n\nThere\u2019s a high likelihood he\u2019ll reach out to you after the breakup, when he\u2019s lonely.

I was so afraid of being alone that I just kept staying, even though we would constantly fight about it and he clearly didn't care how much he was hurting me.\n\nLeaving is hard, and you don't have to feel ashamed for hesitating.  I'm here to tell you that you will feel so much better if you go.  You don't want to spend your life with this asshole, believe me.  Get in touch with family, or friends, any kind of support system.  Maybe take a few days off work and plan to go somewhere cool with your mom or best friend or something.  You want a distraction but you also want distance so he can't pull some manipulation tactic and try to get you back.\n\nSee he tells you it's about an ego boost but I'm 99% sure he's just flat out cheating.  Even if he's just talking to these women, it's an emotional affair and YOU DESERVE BETTER.  No one deserves to put up with this.  Your bf is a scumbag.  I hate men that treat women like this!

British people like us are incredibly liberal (too much so, maybe) so it's hard for us to understand.\n\nOne of the first girls I dated was an absolutely gorgeous and sweet Iranian girl. Although she was quite liberal; she grew up in Britain, her family wasn't. No matter how hard I tried to be to please her parents (bringing small gifts etc.) they took every opportunity to trash talk me, make me feel unwelcome and stop her from seeing me.\n\nNo matter what you do and regardless of how nice your boyfriend is - though he sounds like a piece of shit - you'll never be worthy, never be equal and never be considered a long-term partner.",

You're just blind to the truth because theres just so much pain and you're angry. I get it. \n\nBut please be kind to yourself.

I think he will realize what he has lost, maybe not right away but he will. He may even come running back sooner than you think, and whether you take him back is up to you. (Please don\u2019t ) \n\nI know you think you won\u2019t be ok when you leave him, but you\u2019ll realize you are way better off without him. You\u2019ll have consistency in your life and you won\u2019t wake up everyday feeling hurt because you know what he\u2019s doing.

I've been in relationships almost all the time since the age of 16 to 23. I left my ex before Xmas last year and moved out to live on my own at the end of January. There were pity nights, crying under the shower, feeling so lonely and isolated that I wasn't sure who I am and If I am anymore. But then gradually it got better. I'm still terribly lonely, but also stronger and happier than I've ever been. Learn to enjoy your own company and make your life wonderful on your own, don't ever rely on anyone to get you your happiness. Once you find it for yourself, you can consider sharing it with someone. You don't need to be in a relationship to enjoy your life. Go on the evening walks on your own, treat yourself with the glass of your favorite wine before sleep, dance like crazy when the song you like comes up and don't you ever let anyone make you unhappy for such a long period of time.

He said he wasn't meeting or talking to anyone.\n\n Much later, after a huge fight, he said, \"Fine. Look at my phone. Proof I'm not on Tinder.\" He deleted the app, and tried to make me seem crazy. Except, he didn't think it all through. I had full permission to go into his phone, so I redownloaded it, and found conversations from that very same day. I went into his contact list, and there were names of girls I'd never heard of before, with their location attached. Ie. Amy Seattle, Natasha Portland, Nina Victoria.  (Some back story, he played for a rugby club, and every city he'd gone away on tour, he had two, even three girl's names in his phone.) Absolutely devastating. \n\nWhen he was away at work the next day, I placed all his things into a messy pile in the middle of the living room. Told him he had until noon to grab them, or I'd be putting them out in the alley. \n\nI'm very sorry you went through this horrible experience. I was devastated to hear that he'd been cheating on my for years. It took me years after to realize that it wasn't my fault. I thought something was wrong with me - why would he go so far to not be with me? It gets better. Nothing is wrong with you. Surround yourself with people who love you.

Don\u2019t give him the satisfaction. He doesn\u2019t care about you at all. He doesn\u2019t have the capacity.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting he selected Muslim and Hindu women. Two groups just like Christians that put men below women. He is looking for someone who will submit to him. Sorry but historically British women outside of religion are known not know to submit. You do not have value to him. He wants someone he can control who will ignore his cheating. Be proud of yourself for realizing he isn\u2019t going to change. He is a manipulative gaslighting mentally abusive jerk. He doesn\u2019t want to change and he probably doesn\u2019t even have the capacity. He could also be physically abusive to these women. The fact he is seeking out a certain group is very concerning. \n\nHe is a narcissist. You stood up for yourself and he can\u2019t manipulate you anymore. You have zero use to him now. You were just a source of energy for his life. He needed you to feel special. Now that you called him out for the parasitic leech that he will always be, he is done with you. You were his toy and now that you snapped back, you are garbage to him. \n\nHe might still try and wiggle in. The thrill of getting you under his wing again might be fun for him. He might lash out though if you continue to leave. So stay away!!!! Block him on all social media and your phone. Tell your friends and family you can trust so they can protect you. I am guessing you have some good friends and maybe they have stepped away cause of the abuse. Find them again. Those are good friends, they didn\u2019t stand around and enable. \n\nDo not EVER for any reason go and see him alone. Period. The time after separation is the most dangerous. He isn\u2019t an abuser that would want to kill you because he can\u2019t live without you type deal. He is I will punishing you for having the courage to leave and make me look like a fool. \n\nStay away!!! Do not tell him where you live. Get someone else to return the key. File a restraining order if he comes anywhere near you.\n\nSeriously do no underestimate men like him.",

Soon you will find someone who truly makes you happy. And I bet this piece of work will still be browsing apps looking for girls. Him seeing that you don\u2019t miss him and are at your full potential without him will be the best revenge you can ever give him.",
            "This situation seems familiar.\nThe age gap, the apps, the back and forth of thinking it will change. The total disregard for your feelings and the slow destruction of your self esteem. This was me about 2 years ago. \n\nYou know you should leave, but one thing I haven't seen on the comments yet is that this is emotional abuse. \nYou might already have that thought in your head but don't want to admit it to anyone because you're worried people will think you're over reacting. \nYou are not over reacting. \n\nHe shouldn't be treating your feelings as if they are insignificant. \nI know it's hard, to finally give yourself enough reason to leave. But trust me, you have that strength. \nYour revenge is leaving the guy who treated you like that, meeting someone incredible (because you will) and seeing just how sad and lonely he is when this happens again with someone else.\n\nYou deserve a healthy and loving relationship, but only you can make that choice. You have to believe you deserve more than what he is doing to you. \nDo whatever you need to see it from some one else's perspective. Write it here, tell a friend. Listen to their reactions. More importantly, listen to yourself. You know what you feel and what you need to do to be happy. You've reached out because you know what he has done is wrong.\n\nReclaim your life. Reclaim your self esteem. Accept your strength to be happy without him.",
            "Pretty much what a lot of other people said.  He was dating a 19 to 22 year old because only a handful of women his own age would ever put up with his antics.  Now that you are growing up, he needs another kid to sit in his sandbox with him.  He's a giant man-baby.  Pretending he was asleep?  I was 7 the last time I did that.\n\nI'm sorry you are hurt but believe me, you will be laughing when you think about this asshole in a few years. Red flag in a skin suit.  \n\nHe brought your self-esteem down? Hon, he's a turd with feet. Everything you wrote was the cartoonish jerk boyfriend before the girl meets the right guy part of a romcom movie. \n\nDon't worry about what he is doing.

I'll be honest - any pull I had towards dating apps was to laugh at the bios or get an ego boost.\n\nHowever - I did tell my partner I was doing so and when he eventually expressed discomfort my immediate reaction was to delete the app off my phone.\n\nWe eventually broke up for other reasons but OP, this isn't cool. Any sane partner's reaction to their partner's discomfort shouldn't be to hide stuff and stonewall. Either he faces his mistake or you leave.",

First off you should fulfill your end of the ultimatum and leave.  Besides, do you really see a long term future with some who is so disrespectful of you?\n\n>  But how do I quell this need for closure/revenge?\n\nYour closure and revenge **is leaving!**  By leaving him you'd be  fulfilling your promise to yourself you made when you gave him the ultimatum.  And dodging a bullet.  You're closure is your feeling of self worth for knowing you've fixed a major problem in your life and stood up for yourself.",

            "You need to get out of this relationship. He doesn't care about your feelings. You've already tried talking to him and he still uses these apps, even though he knows it upsets you. What more evidence of him being shitty do you need before you leave?\n\nThe truth here is, you can't control how someone feels. He feels how he feels. Keep reminding yourself of the reasons he isn't right for you. You deserve someone who loves and appreciates you and doesn't do things that hurt you.",
            "Your departure from this relationship is long overdue.\n\nLook, I was like you 5 years ago. My ex had fucked me over and left me broken, used and humiliated. And, like you, I was hellbent on revenge. Why the hell should he get to walk away unscathed after everything he\u2019d put me through? \n\nBut, in time, I realised that the best revenge is living well without them. A year after he left, I met the love of my life. He is, without a shadow of a doubt, my soulmate. I don\u2019t believe that you can love someone unconditionally but damn, does he come close. I don\u2019t have to jump through hoops to get him to love me - he loves me, for me. The good, the bad and the ugly.\n\nMy ex, meanwhile, has been hopping from one loveless relationship to the next, with them seldom lasting more than 6 months. Last I knew, he was in a deep depression because he felt so alone and worthless. And I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t satisfying to know that while he\u2019s continuing to fuck up his life, I\u2019m practically flourishing.\n\nRevenge doesn\u2019t have to be all hellfire and elaborate schemes. It can start with you leaving the relationship. Finding someone who truly loves you. Marrying them and starting a family, if that\u2019s what you want. Meanwhile, your ex will continue to chase younger women until the day he either ends up old and alone, or trapped in a loveless marriage. And when he inevitably hits you up again - because he will - you can have the satisfaction of leaving him on read and blocking him. Revenge is living well without him. Don\u2019t waste another second with someone who, quite frankly, doesn\u2019t give a shit about anyone other than himself.",
            "Ok. Pull yourself together. You're better than this and you know it. You're too good for this immature, cheating, loser. There is no need for a conversation with him at all. Pack up and get out. Closure will not come from any conversation with him. Closure will come when you leave and improve your situation. You have higher standards and deserve a respectful relationship. Don't waste anymore time with this loser. You are better than this. Go on and live a good life. Closure will come with what you do to make your life better, not from him.",
            "I'm glad you left this dirtbag, he clearly has no respect for you. That's not someone worth your gift of time/love/attention. Remember that going forward: you only get one life, so fill it with good people who care about you and want to build you up not tear you down. \n\nHis actions in your relationship combined with his actions as you found this and started packing your bags suggest sabotage: he clearly wanted out of the relationship, but was too much of a chicken shit to dump you. So instead, he left you bread crumbs to find so you'd do the dirty work for him and dump him instead. There was literally nothing to salvage here other than your own happiness and sense of self worth. \n\nAs far as revenge and closure, I'll say this much (and you won't like this, but such as it is): \n\n1) There's oftentimes no such thing as closure in real life. Closure is a Hollywood invention, meant so they can wrap up the 3rd act and roll the credits. Since the \"real life\" version of credits rolling at the end of a movie is probably your funeral, I'd say even without closure if you're still here you're winning. Swallow that pill and move on. \n\n2) Speaking of moving on, it's impossible to do so if you're constantly plotting revenge against your ex. This is extremely unhealthy, and may also lead to illegality that would lead to further unhealthiness. Don't go down this path. Your ex is digging his own deep hole of miserableness to lie in and doesn't need your help. As they say, \"the best revenge is to live well\". Take that to heart and you'll be just fine. \n\nTake care of yourself, OP. The good news is you've done the hard part already. :)",
            "He was gaslighting you even if he wasn't cheating it was still a toxic relationship I think he considered you one of his ego boosters but he himself is never satisfied with just one woman maybe that's why he liked Muslim women over there you can have more than one wife he sounds like a an asshole and a pig and I'm glad you left him he's not going anywhere in life and while it is hard to start over again and get over someone you were just in a relationship with it will all get better personally I see nothing but things going uphill from here",
            "You are so bad ass! Leaving a relationship - no matter the state or situation - can be such a hard thing to do. Especially after so long. But you stood up for what you believe in and what respected yourself enough to draw a line and stick to it. \n\nMy best advice for you in this situation is to take things slow. Spend time with yourself and explore who you are. When you spend so long in such a toxic relationship you can lose so much of what makes you you. Take some time to find that again and go love yourself. It all sounds so cliche but honestly I think it will help. It sounds like you havent gotten too much love and respect the past years. It's time to give yourself that! \nAnother advice - dont jump on the dating-app wagon too quickly. It can seen appealing and like you want to \"beat him to it\". But very rarely does that end well. Take time to just be you, before you start looking for anyone else. That's what helped me at least.\n\nI wish you the best of luck! And happiness! You deserve it!",

He would say that none of them matter because I was \u201cspecial.\u201d\n\nHe left me after I found out he had another girl (F18) that he was with and he didn\u2019t even change up how he flirted with her and the songs he would dedicate to her.  He used the same moves on her as he did with me. I found out about more and more of his lies and his other girls after the fact and it made me feel better about not having him in my life anymore because now I could not care less about how shitty he is in a relationship because I\u2019m out of it. \n\nGuys like him are immature and won\u2019t change unfortunately, they manipulate whoever will let them and they will always see the blame in the other instead of seeing their own faults. Being apart from him has allowed me to feel less stressed about his dishonesty and less hypercritical of myself because I\u2019m no longer thinking \u201cwhy does he need other girls to make him feel good?\u201d \n\nOP there are way better men in this world, you don\u2019t need someone like him dragging you down, trust me.",

Whatever makes you happy and is all about what YOU want and YOU enjoy. Join an exercise class (I\u2019m fat so no gym junkie but exercise is a brilliant way to feel better) or an art class.

Watch movies where women fuck up guys who wronged them. Don't post on social media about him, but tell all your friends.\n\nAs for revenge? This man is pathetic.

My ex was constantly on dating apps like tinder and Bumble, and also dm'ing girls on instragram for that good old \"ego boost\". It went on for about 3 years. It was a nightmare and a constant strain on my mental health. One day, I just left. I couldn't do it anymore. I knew there was someone better for me and I was right.

He\u2019s been lost. He was never really a part of the relationship while you thought he was. He was always looking on the \u201cgreener side\u201d or has some fetish issues. Whatever it may be, you could walk in and out of his life at any point and he would not be present. He has issues. Look at him for what he really is. He is not the fairytale you made him out to be in your head. Step away from this pig and leave. As for what you tell your friends and family? Tell them exactly what he did. He was cheating. You knew he was a cheater but you thought he would change or stop and he didn\u2019t and you are hurting but walking away. And your close friends and family will support you, I guarantee it. It\u2019s ok to be tough on yourself because we end up learning a lot from people like those, but you should remember to value yourself and it doesn\u2019t matter if he built a castle around you, if he is flinging shit all around it.

Most of the time the answer is no - it is wanted, even needed, and would be nice, but ultimately it would not change things.  \n\nIndividuals like your SO either aren't capable of recognizing that what they do is wrong or do but will never acknowledge it.  You can confront him, you can try to get that closure, but to be  blunt, it is as likely to happen as it is for me to ever be able to do a full pull up (spoiler alert it's possible but has never happened before and I am fairly sure never will)",

I did the age gap thing at 22. you might think you\u2019re a fully mature person but there is so so so so so much more growth you will experience in the coming years. I can empathize with how that dynamic of this relationship works. It feels like you\u2019re the ones breaking the odds, that you\u2019ve found this amazing thing that is maybe a little taboo but really you\u2019re just in an incredibly imbalanced relationship. You give him a sense of control, because you don\u2019t have that extra decade of life experience and growth that he has. Most 31 year old women wouldnt put up with his shit and he knows that. That\u2019s why he chose you. I\u2019m sure you care about him a lot and He probably gives you some sense of stability which you probably confuse for love.

But you will be so much happier starting the day you decide to leave and never look back. You will literally cringe when you recall this relationship. No one has time for this in their lives.

If he was in his early 20s, I'd say he needs to grow up before he's ready to date.  Since he's in his 30s I'd say he probably has a problem if he actually wants a long term relationship.  He only enjoys the beginning part of a relationship and bails or cheats when things get serious.

            "Please leave him. I stayed. And once the \"ego boost\" wasn't enough for him (if it ever was really only about the ego boost) he started actually sleeping with other people. Please leave him and save yourself a lot of time and heartache - he doesn't respect you so you have to respect yourself.",
            "My heart is breaking for you. I know how you feel and I know you want nothing more than to inflict the pain he has caused you right back on him. Here\u2019s the thing, it\u2019s not going to happen right now. Considering this a full grown man in his 30\u2019s it may not happen for another 30 years. Your revenge is leaving and moving on from a toxic man who made you feel lesser than. It\u2019s smiling and laughing and forgetting his face. It\u2019s letting him lead a life void of love and affection because he needed to stroke his own ego. Meanwhile, you\u2019ll be focusing on yourself and what makes you happy. You\u2019ll be going on dates with men who want to keep a smile on your face and commit to you in ways this asshole never did. And one day, probably not in the near future, he will realize what an absolute terrible person he was for putting you through this and making you feel this way. When he does your revenge is how it\u2019s going to keep him awake at night. It\u2019ll be when you\u2019re in a happy, committed, loving relationship and he\u2019s continuing to swipe and throwing around meaningless compliments to strangers in attempts to fill a hole in him that will stay there because he doesn\u2019t know how to love anyone but himself. Revenge will not be in a conventional form that brings you instant gratification. It will be when you\u2019ve forgotten all of this and moved on to better yourself and he\u2019s stuck exactly how he is now. Take care of yourself, please. I wish nothing but the best for you.",
            "LEAVE. You deserve better.",
            "Your boyfriend of 3 years won't stop cheating on you. He is actively looking for other women. Irregardless if he is having sex with them, he is cultivating a relationship, flirting, looking for validation.  Call it what it is- infidelity.",
            "Girl, you're 22! Leave. You are so young and you have so much time to find someone who is going to love you and NOT be on dating apps. I know it's scary when you feel like you have to start over, but honestly, you're gonna be so much happier without this crap weighing down your mental health.\n\nLet him party up. When's he's alone at 45 with maybe multiple STI's (he's obviously not very smart!) and you're happy, whether single or married with kids, or having a brilliant job, traveling, whatever you want to do, you'll realize you made the right choice.\n\nThen, hopefully, you won't even think of him, except maybe as a joke. You'll look back and know that you deserved so much better and you learned from that experience.\n\nAlso, you said you need to tell people why you left? Honestly, being on dating apps to me screams of unfaithfulness. And that's all you need to say: \"He was being unfaithful.\" Or \"He wouldn't respect my wishes.\" If you want to remain vague, \"We just wanted different things\" will always suffice.\n\nLastly, know that this has nothing to do with you. Like you said, his previous ex left him for this very reason. This is HIS problem and HIS alone. You can never change someone. They have to change themselves.\n\nAs far as revenge: It's the same as above. Leave. Wait until he's at work, visiting, whatever. Pack your shit, leave the key and get out. I know this may not be possible if you don't have anywhere to go. Find a friend, maybe you can stay with them for a couple days. Or kick him out (If you're the main leaser), and have the locks changed if you can. Regardless, let him go without another word\n\nLeave girl. You'll be so happy that you did.",
            "Definitely end it with him. He sounds insecure and super lame",
            "Yep you need to leave he\u2019s a narcissist.",
            "If you want revenge just do it back. I know the good answer is to leave. Which you should, but if you need to, give him a taste of his own medicine before you go. And if you happen to find your prince win win. Go out on a date infront of him and just say you needed an ego boost.",
            "You know the answer you\u2019ve already said it",
            "The thirst for revenge and closure will pass with time for most people. Allow yourself time to grieve for your relationship and don't close yourself off from new people, friendships, and romance.",
            "Wrong! He doesn't want to go on dates with internet strangers. He wants to feel powerful by being in a relationship with someone he can control and still seek validation from women whom he doesn't know. My guess is this guy probably doesn't have a lot going on in his life right now so this is his way of not feeling like a loser. Well, he is. And he doesn't see the damage he's doing to himself because he's lost one good woman and he's getting ready to lose another, there is a saying that men are terrible to dealmakers. We exchange gold for copper and it looks like that's what's happening here. Sorry OP. But if he doesn't see what he's doing he won't change.",
            "He sounds like a creepy dude tbh.\n\nI say that based on your quote of what he\u2019s looking for in that dating app. Silly and over-sharing: reads as naive and easy to manipulate.",
            "Leave him asap. He isnt changing for you or for the next girl. Get out now and focus on your life.",
            "Is he also Hindu/Muslim? You're the white girl he has fun with while he looks for the women his parents will be happy about him being with.",
            "Just came here to agree with everyone else. You don't deserve what he's doing to you. Get out. Work on healing yourself. \n\nI had to do the same with my ex. I surrounded myself with supportive loving people to help me through the  process. And a year later I found my soulmate. \n\nLike someone else said, the best revenge will be you eventually finding someone who loves and respects you and shows you that everyday. And he's still there getting dumped using dating apps. I can vouch for that too. It's nice to see them still being who they were when you were together. The same miserable asshat. Lol\n\n Also, he's 31??? Am I seeing that right? That man has no self respect. Damn.",
            "Oooo he is so lucky I am a stranger and not your bff! Would drop kick him so freaking fast. Im so sorry OP! He sounds like a total fool and he is acting very much like my ex husband when I caught him having an affair. \n\nI dont know if your guy is cheating, but he\u2019s certainty disrespectful towards you. Personally that\u2019s enough to send him on his way.",
            "Hold on!! How are you two established as boyfriend/girlfriend!! And he's using dating apps still! And how did you let it happen for so long?",
            "I think its time to leave too.",
            "Isn't realizing he's a shit person truly the best closure?",
            "Tbh I'd be uncomfortable if they didn't stop using dating apps after a month unless its an app strictly for friendship. If you're dating someone more than a few times in any context there's no need to be communicating with other people unless/until that relationship officially doesn't pan out (which isn't always the case hopefully).",
            "Leave while you're still young.  I dated a guy that was also addicted to apps like these and even responding to Craigslist nasty ads.  And emailing dick pics to strangers emails.  I left him when I was 23, wish I would have left him sooner.  Get out, this is an addiction and he doesn't care who he hurts.  Also he may be a narcissist.",
            "Don\u2019t worry about consequence go live you best life. Fuck these men girl there so many in this world find one who works with you",
            "Honestly the best thing you can do is leave. You will find someone that will be 100% faithful and treat you right. You don't need all of that negativity in your life. No person should have to put up with that. I know you were hoping he would change but it's been 3 years and he knows it hurts you when he uses dating apps and he continues to hurt you. Hes not worth it.",
            "If u want revenge, just make a dating app of ur own and See how he feels... although it doesn't change the fact that he's a douche and not someone u want to be with.",
            "He is addicted to sexting and dating apps, the fact that he has you and still do it show that he somehow think he can either do better or something about you doesn't attract him anymore, as for revenge there nothing you could do that would really satisfy you, anything you do will only reinforce his thoughts that you were not deserving of him. If you really want to give him a reality check, install Tinder and show him when you have 200 matchs in one day. This will fuck with his ego pretty badly since man take days to have matches.",
            "Best revenge is living the good life, without him.",
            "the only revenge you need is the knowledge that he will never be in a fullfilling and happy relationship and you can be. i've been in this situation and i know how hard it is to leave and you probably think you're never going to be happy and that is just not true. it takes time but things will get better, i promise. you have family and hopefully friends to get you through it.",
            "The most concerning aspect of this is that he tried to manipulate you by suggesting your anxiety about him acting strangely was due to you being \u2018hormonal\u2019. That shows such a blatant disregard for your wellbeing and is emotionally abusive. You already know his using these apps isn\u2019t acceptable, but you need to recognise his attempts to twist it into you being irrational are really damaging. You say he\u2019s knocked your self-esteem and I can believe it. You\u2019ll only rebuild that when you\u2019re out of that situation and realising you deserve more.\n\nI get the desire to see him hurt or for revenge but you should prioritise your own well-being and getting yourself into a good place. It won\u2019t be easy but it\u2019ll serve you better in the long run. Sending you love and support, you really don\u2019t deserve to be treated like this.",
            "So you were 19 and he was 28, that\u2019s already an awful start no one who\u2019s 30 should be interested in someone who\u2019s a teenager, it\u2019s beyond creepy. On top of him probably using that power imbalance he sounds like an awful boyfriend who will never respect you. You\u2019ll probably never get closure off this man, because he sounds like that kind of person, so try to make your peace with the fact he\u2019s awful and you have a much brighter future ahead with someone who won\u2019t cheat",
            "I bet this is not the first situation where you feel like shit and he doesn't, although he should. This is not a way to be treated from a partner.",
            "Oh my godddd just walk away already. He\u2019s going to keep doing it if you stay with him.",
            "anyone whose ego needs that kind of boost regularly is pretty insecure and would probably cheat",
            "Yes, leave please. His behaviour is definitely not normal for someone in a relationship and you deserve way way better.",
            "My ex did this to me... I found Tinder on his phone so many times over the 2 years we dated.\n\nI still want revenge on him, but honestly, it came in the best way possible almost two years after I left him... I am dating an amazing person and my ex is stuck with living with himself for the rest of his life ;)",
            "OP, I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re going through this. This is utterly awful and you deserve much better treatment than this. Your boyfriend (for the moment at least), is self-centered, disrespectful, and disingenuous. \n\nI can\u2019t help but ask, but is your boyfriend of Indian descent? I\u2019m an Indian woman (but not a good one) and unfortunately I\u2019ve seen things play out where some Indian men date whoever, but when they\u2019re ready for a long-term relationship they cave to family expectations and marry someone from their ethnicity/religion. I\u2019ve also seen the opposite, but I couldn\u2019t help but wonder after you included that piece on his dating profile. If this is what\u2019s happening, this is particularly hurtful because that means he\u2019s lied from the very beginning. It will be hard, and it will hurt leaving, but it already sounds like it hurts. Pain will be present whether you try to get answers from him or not, the best thing to do is to think of yourself and your needs. \n\nSending you loving, positive energy.",
            "Lmao 31 year old male dates 22 year old female? I wonder why.",
            "I would have never accepted that even for a second. You stayed way too long. I had an ex who was a pretty terribly boyfriend to me, but he was my first love and I couldn\u2019t let him go. Finally he ended it with me after 1.5 years (he ended up regretting it). Honestly the first 2 weeks are the hardest. Surround yourself with friends and enjoy being single. Flirt with the cute guys you see. You don\u2019t need to jump into anything just yet, but it will make you feel better. I did not see how bad I had it until I met my current boyfriend, and now I\u2019m glad my ex dumped me.",
            "I\u2019m glad you are out of this. You deserve better and you will find it.",
            "Oh sweetie, I'm so sorry this happened.  But good for you for packing up and leaving.  What you do now is do a post-mortem on the relationship - see what warning signs you ignored for too long, so you know not to ignore them again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVery glad you had a place to run to, and you should spend some time nesting and hanging out with friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*hug from an Internet stranger old enough to be your mother\\*",
            "Some men have major commitment issues that they don't even acknowledge to themselves. It wasn't an accident that he was hurting you with dating apps. He may not know how to break things off when he starts feeling the commitment fear. Sounds like his routine is to sabotage relationships. It wasn't a dig about the key, it was what he expected to happen.",
            "I\u2019ve been where you are. Leave before you end up married or with a kid and it is much more difficult. You are 22, you may not realize it, but you have so much time and opportunity to find the right man. Don\u2019t waste your time being treated poorly. Focus on respecting yourself, concentrate on how much more you deserve. He will not change, leave him in the past. This is a learning experience. Trust me, leaving and being happy will be revenge enough. He is 31 and acting this way, treating a young girl this way. He\u2019s such a loser and you don\u2019t need to get revenge because he will screw his life up on his own.",
            "Your boyfriend sounds like an insecure loser. It\u2019s going to be difficult for you but you need to understand that this is definitely not normal behavior. You should feel relieved knowing that one day when he\u2019s alone and feeling like shit he\u2019ll remember how good you were to him and at that moment you will be a healthy, loving relationship with someone who actually cares about your feelings. Great job for leaving. It\u2019s going to be tough but once you get him out of yiur mind and focus your energy on other things you will never look back. Good luck.",
            "I think you handled this in a respectful manner",
            "Girl, honestly please don't be hard on yourself, we all go through some sort of asshole in our early 20s. It sucks that these men prey on young women who don't know better yet, but this situation is entirely on him. When I went through something similar, 9 years ago now, I wish I could back to that time and take back all the horrible thoughts I had about myself. \n\nIt's good that you're angry, don't turn that on yourself, focus it like a laser and use it to live a better life, to love yourself more and remind yourself that you're never going back to that abusive, pathetic man who has to use manipulation tactics to get anyone to fuck him.",
            "What a fucking douchebag! Wow. You are better off without that for sure!  Hugs to you!",
            "When you have had some rest make some time in your day to unpack all your stuff. The sooner your student apartment feels like home the better.\n\nLean on your friends ask them to help unpack make it a pizza and wine party. Cry, laugh take a deep breathe and move on from this asshole.",
            "So glad that you didn't go with the revenge. You would have felt awful about it later. Trust me!\n\nJust a bit of perspective. This dude was never into enough to go monotonous. He was likely cheating on you the whole time. I'd wager that he doesn't think highly of woman and is somewhere high on the narcissist spectrum. He was 30 preying on naive teenagers for sex and he just kept you a round for his ego. Knowing all this but without dating him before would you have given him the time of day all those years ago? I doubt it... but it shows how you made a bad decision in your youth. It allows you to be 100% responsible for this relationship. It removes his control and makes him the sad little man he is.\n\nTake responcibility for YOUR actions and be better at vetting the people you allow in your life.",
            "Sis, the best revenge is going to be when you realize you're doing great without him. He may or may not see it, but you'll know, and trust me when I tell you that will be enough.",
            "The best revenge is living well. He is a fucking sociopath and you would have only set yourself up for a life of hurt. Girl. You are a young woman with endless possibilities. I really fucking wish young women knew what us middle agers do. \n\nWomen run the show.\n\nNot necessarily in relationships but if you understood how much power you have you wouldn't be sitting in bed crying. Its easy to meet men. Very easy. So be CHOOSY. \n\nIm sorry. Hes an idiot. And you still have a great future. Fuck that guy.",
            "You've learned that this is absolutely not acceptable behavior in a relationship with you. If you run into a guy who's doing this, then you know he doesn't value you and that you are better off without said man. Best of luck, I hate it took you so long to see the truth and that he was not really invested, but I'm glad you finally did and left! Best of luck!!",
            "I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve left. There\u2019s a reason he\u2019s 31 and not in a long term relationship. Seems you found it.",
            "oh my God gurl.  First of all I am SO PROUD of you for leaving that douchebag.  You deserve to be treated with respect from a partner whom appreciates you.  And trust me, he's out there! And when you find him and actually get treated the way you should in a relationship, you're going to kick yourself for ever having let anyone treat you with so much contempt and disrespect. That dude should come with a damn warning label. Focus on yourself now and do yourself a favor and block his number.  Cut that poison out of your life so you can heal.  Much love babe.",
            "I'm sorry he did that to you. You deserve so much better than someone who doesn't care enough to say goodbye. Have fun being single!",
            "As soon as I would've read \"leave the keys\".\nMy reaction would be like, \" oh yeah... aaaand *blocked*. \nBlock this charming fella's number and social media outlets out of your life. Congratulations on your freedom. Happy to hear you left with your dignity.",
            "Sending you hugs. Please know that it WILL get better down the road. \n\nI was in a relationship with a serial cheater at 19 and it was terrible. He was kinda like your ex - looking for ego boosts by getting girls. At the same time I couldn\u2019t leave because it was so painful. But I did and now, eleven years later, I\u2019m happily married to a man who loves and respects me, and that ex is divorced. From what I heard, he cheated on his wife, and then cheated on the girl whom he cheated on his wife with. Basically hasn\u2019t changed a bit, and still getting \u201cego boosts\u201d from serial hookups. \n\nIt\u2019s tough but not impossible. What helped me get out from that funk was this:\n\n1. Surround yourself with a solid, loving network that supports your decision to leave. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re seeing your family.\n\n2. Prepare yourself for the moments of weakness. There are going to be moments where you miss him, or just feel really sad. In your strong moments, anticipate what you will do in the weak moments and prepare for them. Write a journal entry listing the reasons you left him, call a friend who will help counsel you in those moments, etc. Having a plan in place will help mitigate impulsive reactions. \n\n3. Talk to people to recalibrate your notions of \u201cnormal\u201d. After dating a serial cheater, your ideas of what\u2019s normal and what\u2019s not will have changed because serial cheaters tend to normalise their behaviour and make you feel like you\u2019re the crazy one, that you\u2019re overreacting, and over time you begin to doubt yourself. You need to correct this after coming out of that destructive relationship. Talk to girlfriends, talk to guy friends who are or have been attached, find out their opinion of fidelity in a relationship. \n\nPlease know that things will get better no matter how shitty they are right now. The strongest steel is forged in the hottest fire.",
            "You are worth more than this.",
            "Seems like there's a reason he wanted to start dating you when you were 18 or 19.  He was able to do all this and make you think it's normal so it's not normal",
            "His last text was enough to tell you that leaving was the best thing for you to do. This feels shitty rn but he'll miss or think about you one day and you won't be around. He'll look for you in other women. Your best revenge is just being happy.",

GOT is great, Kim\u2019s convience is easy, the better office ( American version \ud83d\ude09), just watch stuff you normally wouldn\u2019t. Old black and white movie, just have fun!! Don\u2019t be too harsh on yourself if you get sad and reminisce, just let it float into your thoughts and keep letting it float right out of them. Good luck and I\u2019m glad you stood up for yourself!",
            "I saw the edit and I'm glad you left him, the age difference was a big red flag and it usually always ends up being something you cant get ever at your age (I'm 23). Hes clearly just trying to live some fantasy of having a gf he can show off, while hes chasing tail every chance he gets. No woman his age will ever tolerate that and so his ego gets torn down to pieces. He is a dirtbag and doesn't deserve more than his own right hand to keep him company. You will find someone better OP, just keep your head up and wipe the tears away, one day at a time.",
            "My advice is to never look back. Don\u2019t check what he\u2019s up to. Don\u2019t ask how he\u2019s doing. Pamper yourself. Back when i was at this stage, when I catch myself starting to think about him, I would start projects or something. I would start deep cleaning. I would take the dogs out for a long walk. I would do my hair and make something amazing. I would do my make up, get dressed even when I\u2019m not doing anything. I would blast my music, dance around the house in my gorgeous outfit, sing along the tunes. \n\nWake up, shower, put on something beautiful, do your make up, feel beautiful, worth it and independent. The world is now officially your oyster! You won\u2019t appreciate singleness at first but ones you find your groove, it\u2019ll take a really special person to get you out of that life.\n\nPS don\u2019t think about revenge. You hold on to bad memories and to that person when you think about what you should do to make him suffer. The best way to get \u2018revenge\u2019 is to be indifferent about him.

Find a new hobby to keep yourself occupied until you get used to being single.\n\nThis January I broke off someone equally disrespectful and manipulative, and I have felt only better and better since.

There are consequences to his actions though and I imagine he won\u2019t find anything substantial by playing these childish games. If you were to stay with him, then he would have had zero consequences for his actions. But you didn\u2019t and I applaud you for that, since it\u2019s not easy to leave a long-standing relationship- even when you know you\u2019re not being treated right. \n\nYou\u2019ve made the right choice and there\u2019s a reason why he\u2019s not dating someone closer to his age unfortunately.

Instead, let yourself hurt for a bit, treat yourself right, then move on. I do this exercise where I picture my mind palace, and I pictured my ex and ask him to leave.

I thought I should just give her space for a few days. I think a day or two after It was announced that I was being promoted. Some of  my colleagues hosted a little after work dinner for me as I would be moving divisions and not working with them anymore. It was nice and It really touched me and it also made me understand how fucked our relationship had become. I got what the comments meant but I guess actually having a nice dinner celebrating my success felt great and made me truly understand how unhappy I felt. \n\nwe had the talk a few days later. I told her that I felt unhappy and unappreciated. That I felt like I needed some time away from her. She almost seemed like she was waiting for this. she didn't seem particularly upset over it. She said she understood and she would move back to her parents as soon as possible. I know it is ugly but some part of me wanted her to be upset. some proof that she cared for me? I don't know. I feel like she didn't love me at all. I feel like I wasted years being in love with her. \n\nShe moved out two weeks ago and I miss her a lot. Home feels really lonely without her but at the same time I feel better. Not a lot but I feel a bit better about myself. It is strange. \n\nShe is not a bad person. she is a wonderful person and that is why I fell in love with her but the closer we got the less happy our relationship made me. I know a lot of it was my fault and I need to work on communication skills.  \n\n\n TL;DR : I realized how profoundly unhappy our relationship made me and broke up with her.",

            "I know it's hard but you absolutely did the right thing.   I remember your original post and was so frustrated at your ex's behaviour.\n\nIt's going to be hard and sad now but you will be so happy soon.  Take the time to breathe freely and enjoy being on your own.",
            "Sounds like you did the right thing. My partner also has a deceased ex, and I certainly would struggle of he was comparing me to her constantly. Grief is odd, but boundaries need to be maintained.\n\nWishing you the best.",
            "You absolutely did the right thing OP, here is to a new start \ud83e\udd42",
            "Two years is better than twenty, man.\n\nBreathe, take it one day at a time, and you'll come out ahead from this. Trust me.\n\nAlso: she doesn't have to be a bad person to be in the wrong here. Don't beat yourself up thinking she's blameless.",

            "Sorry man. Honestly, when people die young they are automatically canonized. She has a memory in her head of someone that likely never existed and will continue to hold everyone to this unrealistic standard. She clearly didn\u2019t get enough help for her trauma and you shouldn\u2019t have to live your life being compared to a kid that - while probably a good guy - has the luxury of never having to deal with adult problems with her or go through any real difficulty. Until she breaks up with him she wont be able to be happy with anyone else",
            "I'm just seeing the original from this one and I cannot believe you dealt with that for two years. Most people would have been done within a couple of months. It's one thing to talk about a person you loved that died. It's a totally different thing to cut someone else down for not being like them. Enjoy your promotion and learn from this experience. You now have a profound understanding of a few things you don't want in a relationship.",
            "You said she's a wonderful person, but it didn't seem like she was that wonderful to you. You deserve better. It hurts now, but that's okay. You did the right thing. Take your time to grieve.\n\nAnd I think it's normal to feel like you, that your partner should be upset. When I met my ex after breaking up a few months prior, I felt really relieved by seeing that he grieved our relationship. It made me think that we both had appreciated what we had. I think your ex might gruevevtoo, but silently. You're not a bad person for feeling the way you do.",
            "That was brutal, reading your original post. She needs help but seemed stuck. You absolutely did the right thing. You\u2019re in the hardest part now but it will get better.",
            "Just read the original post. As a stranger on the internets, the lack of any kind of self awareness from her was painful to read. Right call to make long term though, my dude.",
            "You did the right thing. Hopefully your ex puts in the work to fix herself and become healthy, but it\u2019s no longer your problem.",
            "Seems like maybe she was using her deceased boyfriend as a way to drive a wedge between the two of you, in order to force a break-up? She clearly wasn't over him yet, so I think it might be for the best. She needs time to properly grieve the guy and you can find someone who actually loves you for you and doesn't compare you to other people (living or dead).",
            "Being held to an impossible standard and in such a shitty way is not healthy. I think that its best that you guys are separated for now",
            "I'm glad you moved on and I'm sorry her reaction gave you so little closure. You deserve better than that. But it's better that you bit the bullet now rather than another year hence.\n\nI wish all the people who say \"I can't break up with this person because I will break their heart\" would just read this and see how hard it is to have your time wasted like this and then realise the other person wasn't invested. \n\nI wish you a happier future with someone who sees your worth as you are.",
            "> I feel like she didn't love me at all. I feel like I wasted years being in love with her.\n\nThe sad part about this is - You're right to feel the way that you do as well as assume she didn't love you, since she herself purposely wasted your time instead of genuinely coming to terms with her grief. Even more messed up, instead of her breaking up with you months/ years earlier, thus not wasting anymore time - she was waiting on you to break up with her after all comparisons & negativity, like she needed a excuse to further make herself a martyr or something. \n\nYou still did the right thing for yourself because the relationship was long dead and you yourself was unhappy that you need the change - I wish you well in all your future endeavors and hope you find yourself a relationship where both your love and time are truly valued, instead of wasted on an unappreciative person like your ex.",
            "Dude been there done that. Shit is fucking exhausting. You have to learn to move on or all your relationships will fail because of the later. For me it was too the point of oh so and so liked that. Constant comparison.  Like ok let me go elsewhere until you fully heal. Sucks but it is what it is.",
            "You're right. She wasn't shocked that you wanted to break up because she expected it. She knows she isn't over her ex, but when she met you thought 'I have to try. Maybe someone new will help'.\n\nShe's knows the way she's been treating you was cruel and unhealthy, and I hate to say this but no, she probably didn't really love you. How can she? She's in love with her ex. She constantly compared you to him in a negative way. You were a failed attempt at getting under someone to get over someone. This woman is completely emotionally unavailable.\n\nShe might not be a bad person, but at the moment, she's a very broken person and broken people make bad choices which often result in someone else being treated poorly.\n\nYou've absolutely done the right thing and you shouldn't feel a single bit of guilt.\n\nGo and find someone who wants you, not her ex.",
            "Hey, congrats on your new job. You should be able to celebrate without being dragged down. You will find someone who will appreciate you for being you.",
            "What do you mean a lot of this was your fault.. None of that was your fault at all.  Dead boyfriend or not the stuff she was pulling is unhealthy. Was she like that when you first hooked up? If so then I'm honestly surprised you lasted 2 years with someone down playing everything you do.\nIm glad you're on your own. Take some time to reflect and enjoy just being yourself. Hang out with friends. Stay single for a while, it'll help you grow as a person. Figure out your goals in life. Then search for another woman to bring into your life.  \n\nNever let someone talk down about what you've accomplished. You're obviously more patient and caring than your gf ever gave you credit for.\n\nAs for the girlfriend. She needs counseling/therapist whether her parents will get her one of those or she will herself is up to her.  Sorry for her loss but her way of grieving/mourning isnt healthy.",
            "I think that you did the right thing, for both your sakes. She may find it impossible to let go of her ex and you would find it impossible to match up to imagined perfection. This reminds me of James Joyce's short story, \"The Dead\", which centers around such themes. Good luck in your life!",
            "Stop giving yourself the blame man, \"it's my fault, I made this, i did this\" it just didn't work out, probably for the best",
            "Seems like a good outcome, you weren't in the wrong at all and she seemed like she didn't deal with her grief yet, maybe she'd need counseling. She probably romanticises her relationship with her previous boyfriend as he has passed away and doesn't remember the bad things. Good for you though.",
            "Having lost a long term spouse myself, it seems like she hasn't moved on yet. Some people take just a little time, some longer, some forever. She probably needs to seek more professional help with moving on at this point since she keeps referring to her late b/f in comparisons and conversations. At this point you did the best thing, worry about you and your future.",
            "It takes a lot of strength and courage to do what you did. Putting yourself first is always best. All the best to you in the future :)",
            "You do deserve someone who will cherish the way you are without the need to compare you with their past lovers. Wish you the best of luck to you and your ex and congratulations on the acheivement!",
            "Smart move! Continue to work on yourself and I'm sure you'll come across someone who wants to appreciate you for your accomplishments and celebrate them with you.",
            "She is going to treat the next guy like this too, and hopefully, that guy figures it out within six months. \n\nThere are people that go through divorces that try this type of thing too.  Everyone is different in how they treat the other person.   \n\nWas the work function one you could bring someone?  If so, did anyone ask about her?\n\nYou did the right thing.",
            "I\u2019m sure someone has suggested this already, but there is a James Joyce short story called \u201cThe Dead\u201d which is all about this. Well worth a read.",
            "You definitely did the right thing.  She doesn't want you, she wants her deceased boyfriend.  She needs to work on herself before she can contribute to a healthy relationship, and you are correct, your relationship was not healthy!!  No one should have to go through a relationship constantly being compared to someone else!!\n\nGood Luck, it will get easier with each passing day.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS on the promotion!!",
            ">I know a lot of it was my fault and I need to work on communication skills.\n\nBased on your two posts, I really don't think this is the case. You're not superhuman, you reacted to some pretty strong provocation from someone you love who was belittling you over a period of time. And it culminated on a day that should have been about you, but that she made about your perceived inadequacies in comparison with the imaginary version of her boyfriend, who lives on a pedestal in her memory.\n\nShe sounds like she wasn't ready or willing to move on. So you have to move on from her.",
            "Losing someone suddenly can break something inside of you and you need serious help to deal with it. Seems like that's where she is.",
            "OP, I'd also suggest you use this as a lesson moving forward, that you should address things that are bothering you in a quiet, calm time, so that you don't let it build, and then blow up in the heat of the moment. This possibily could have been solved by sitting down with her at a time you guys *weren't* arguing, and saying something like: \"hey, I don't know if you even realize you're doing this, but when we fight, you often bring up Bob, and compare me to him. When that happens, it makes me feel *(insert feelings here... unappreciated, sad, upset, worthless, etc.)*. I understand that Bob was a huge part of your life, and he made you the person you are today in some ways, and I would never ask you to stop talking about him or forget him, but would you be willing to not bring him up during fights?\"",
            "So sorry OP. This was the only way to go. Anybody would have felt like shit if their partner constantly brought up how great their dead ex is. \n\nIn your first post, when I read she responded to your anxiety by saying, \u201cBoyfriend had been so calm and collected. Very chill about everything. He could just shrug off anything\u201d...my eyes rolled SO HARD. How awful, no self awareness.\n\nYou will feel better and stronger with time. You\u2019ll meet someone in a better position to love you.",
            "Good riddance, can now move on with your life rather than be the off the shelf replacement.\n\nHow she treated you was and is distinctly unfair. For you, you were trying your best, for her it sounds like you were there only to fill a gap.\n\nThat isn't love and isn't what you deserve going forward.",
            "You've gotten a lot of responses reassuring you that you did the right thing for yourself, and that's absolutely true but I wanted to add that it sounds like you made the right decision for your SO as well. \n\n\n\n\n\nThere was no way you guys were going to have a healthy relationship until she addresses the trama from her past and you might have just given her the push she needs to finally face it. I was in a similar situation and honestly my SO breaking up with me probably saved my life. I was in a downward spiral refusing to get help for years and he finally couldn't take it anymore. I was absolutely broken and couldn't pretend I was okay anymore. Reaching out/getting help It was absolutely the hardest thing I've ever done but it was the only way I was going to get better. I would never have taken that step if I had still been with SO. Despite his best intentions by putting up with my shit and being my emotional punching bag he was actually enabling me to continue hiding from my real problems. \n\n\n\n\nI know you are hurting but its obvious that you genuinely care/cared for her. Give it some time and do what you need to do to move on with your life but don't ever feel guilty for doing what you both needed.",
            "Honestly she never got over him and it\u2019s horrible she did that to you.  She was way out of line. Please stop making excuses for someone who treated you this way. You deserve better and she needs grief counseling because she obviously never worked through it. Honestly reverse the roles and she would\u2019ve left a long time ago.  Tell her your exes did this and that better and she would\u2019ve gotten it.",
            "I read some of the original post. You did the right thing absolutely and although it will be hard for a bit, you\u2019ll be ok \ud83d\udc4d you deserve the relationship you want to have. Talking about your ex is a red flag, and yes she still has feelings for him etc. So you want a person that sees only you, a partner, your other half. Before heading into anything serious once again I\u2019d say take some time being single.",
            "It's always better to be alone by choice, then to be alone with others.\n\nYou made the right call. Don't see it as wasted. You learned from the relationship, and know what to look out for in the future. The difference between \"Science\" and \"messing around\" is note taking.\n\nCongratulations on the job promotion!",
            "Should have told her not to compare you two instead of not to talk about him, period. I understand it was the heat of the moment tho.",
            "You made the right decision. No person should be constantly forced to live up to the standards created by another person, even if the said forcing is inadvertent. She was looking for him in you, which should've been a big red flag. But I'm glad you're happy now.",
            "Read the original post and this one and a lot of the comments. A lot of people here trying to make her a villain but I don't think you need to hear that. Sometimes two people are not compatible and that's OK. Sometimes two people can care about each other and still be incompatible and that's OK. Your now ex might be a great person but she clearly has serious trauma that she needs to deal with on her own before she can move forward. Your feelings of relief now that the relationship has ended are evidence of how greatly unhappy you actually were in it as well. Take some time. Grieve the ending of the relationship. You loved her and on some level I'm sure she loved you but ultimately you were not right for each other. Best wishes dude.",
            "I (34f) lost my boyfriend (we were off and on) in a car accident 12 years ago so I can sympathize with her.  However I have never inserted how he was or how he treated me into my relationships after his death.  I do sit with a picture of him on his birthday and drink his favorite beer and my husband will sit and drink one with me.  They went to the same high school but never met but he has met his parents who I'm still close with and my husband likes the idea that we can honor his memory this way each year.  It sounds like she's still grieving and may need to take some time to heal before getting into another relationship.  \n\nI am so sorry that she made you feel unhappy and unappreciated.  I hope your time apart can help you heal.  You deserve good things and a healthy relationship.",
            "You deserve to be celebrated and to be able to have a relationship without a third party\u2019s constant presence. \n\nPeople whose partners died understandably often consider that person an integral part of their lives, but the deceased shouldn\u2019t be more of a focus than the person they are with right now. \n\nSounds like she started dating before she was ready to move on & you paid a price for it. \n\nCongrats on the promotion!!!!",
            "\"What is\" will never live up to \"what could have been\" if people don't let it. I think you made the right call. As time goes on you will feel better about yourself as it seems that she was the one not willing to invest in the relationship.",
            "I'm sorry man. I didn't see the original post, just caught up in the update. I'm 33F and my boyfriend died when I was 26 and he was 28. Our daughter had just turned a year old.  \n\nI started a new relationship 2 years later with a bad person. He told me at one point that when he started dating me, he thought it was a plus that the guy before him passed bc he wouldn't have to \"deal with baby daddy drama\" then he said \"but it's actually worse bc you still love him, and most chicks hate their exes.\" When he said it, it was with a sneer and he said it with the intention of trying to make me feel like I was less worthy bc of this and needed to act accordingly to make up for it. This kind of behavior was not an isolated incident so that's why I'm certain of his intentions when he made that remark.\n\nFast forward to now. My current partner has his own home and stays at mine most of the time. My late BF's pic is in every room but my bedroom, where I just have pics of my daughter. My current partner knows the things I loved about my boyfriend and he knows about a few fights we had and he knows about his life, his upbringing, and some his mistakes. I don't talk about my late boyfriend all the time, I definitely don't talk shit about him, bc he was my bf and my best friend but so many of my parenting and relationship experiences come from our time together so when you're with someone for years, things come up in conversation. But I don't lie, or omit relevant pieces of the story, just bc they make my late boyfriend look less than perfect. Those faults are what made him human and it's important for my daughter to know that both her parents are/were far from perfect... I definitely wouldn't bring him up during a celebration for my current boyfriend's accomplishments. The only scenario I could think of mentioning him in a situation like that would be along the lines of: \"when I lost ___ I thought I'd also lost my chance to get to celebrate this kind of thing with my partner and plan for a better life together. I'm so grateful to be sharing this with you. I'm so grateful for you, I'm so proud of you.\u201d\n\nYou deserve someone who\u2019s first instinct is to encourage and congratulate you, bc they love you so much, that your feelings and happiness make them happy too! If you\u2019re not getting that, then good for you for leaving. You\u2019re right she isn\u2019t a bad person, she\u2019s a growing person, and you\u2019re separating so you can both grow independently. That\u2019s so healthy and I\u2019m so proud of you for applying for the promotion and for allowing yourself to move forward in a positive way even if it\u2019s kind of scary doing it alone.",
            "Wise decision. She needs help and you\u2019re not there to be her crutch. Go enjoy your life and be happy.",
            "I would make sure to stay broken up with her. And in a hard zero contact way for a very long time, or for the rest of your life. That will almost surely be for the best for both of you. If you go back, because you get too lonely, the dynamic will be more or less the same. And you just don't want to repeat such a cycle over and over.",

            "OP I'm going to say this to you because no one else is saying it to you, you're 100% in your right and she's at fault, she didn't go through the necessary healing processes and therapy to get over her loved one, and took it out on you.. to the point where this was emotional abuse, I don't care if grief is her excuse, I've lost several people and I've never took it out on my loved ones.\nWish people would stop overlooking the fact that she coped with the fact that she lost her ex by abusing you.. I don't care, it doesn't matter what your healing structure is that's unreasonable and she probably always had it in her so you dodged a bullet.",

            "read your OP and now the update - some observations (context - as someone who has used the last decade + pandemic to do major personal / pathological self work and also formerly viewed toxic relationships as ones that had 'communication issues')\n\nPlease consider the idea that it was an emotionally abusive relationship, not through malice (intent to be shitty) but through teaching of failed parental models.\n\nPlease consider that the constant comparison to a question mark person (someone you can't even connect with / speak to / hear from / learn from) in a direct way or even remotely in a constructive way [in a way where the intent is healing or evolving you for your own benefit genuinely] is toxic behavior.\n\nPlease consider that in a time and place where you're celebrating YOUR promotion for YOUR hard work, dedication and discipline (huge congrats btw - that's a mega achievement and you deserve every second of praise and celebration, and please don't be afraid to claim it/own it), it should 100% be about you and your happiness and celebration. To inject that question mark comparison in such a way almost sounds intentionally gaslighting (like she's passive aggressively unhappy for you and throwing a subtle thorn to upset your joy train) - EVEN IF IT'S NOT,  it's not a comment that you want to hear, or even remotely is in your favor - totally inappropriate for your PARTNER to say!!\n\nPlease consider that you saying something is an act of SELF SERVICE by VOICING YOUR TRUTH in a time when this is something you are not used to doing for yourself. It's going to feel weird, unhappy, uncomfortable - but all growth does. \n\nAwesome job in standing up for yourself - you legit sound like you can do better. Please consider seeking a partner who SHOWS UP FOR YOU and allows you to show up for them, too.",
            "I only read your original post now. I think it was worse than you realise. To me it looked like regular old emotional abuse - she just had a dead boyfriend to hide behind. If it was really the case that she still has him on her mind and that she just can\u2019t help but to compare, she would have made comparisons when you did better than him too. I mean, he had to have some flaws, right?",
            "You did nothing wrong and you made the right decision.  Whether her ex-boyfriend was dead or not, I could not handle being with a woman who would constantly compare me to her ex.  It was so disrespectful on her part.  Move forward and don\u2019t look back.",
            "Every relationship has its purpose in our lives, whether good or bad. Perhaps this relationship was meant to help you identify some self image/confidence issues you have that could use some work. For you to be able to identify that you were being treated unfairly and that you have more worth than you\u2019d been getting credit for, and then to act in your own best interests is a big deal, especially when anxiety is a factor. \n\nRelationships ending always sucks, it hurts because we make ourselves vulnerable. That\u2019s the not so good part that you\u2019re feeling. But this passes with time. Don\u2019t sell yourself shirt on the fact that you made a really tough decision based on the fact that you know your worth. That\u2019s a big deal & shouldn\u2019t be ignored. Work on the issues that you identified within yourself, and your future relationship(s) will benefit for that. My guess is that was the purpose of this relationship all along.",

It is unbelievably unfair to you, and completely callous of her.\n\nI feel sorry for the next guy she does this to. Nobody deserves to be compared to the dead.

Now before anyone gets mad about how I put that, look at what just happened.  \n\nShe didn't give half a damn.  \n\nOP says \"Stop talking about (her dead ex)\" because she keeps tearing him down by essentially saying \"He would have handled (insert topic here) better\".  Any time his actions didn't please her, not only did he have that in his mind, but she was also pining for some other guy.  That would do a number on anyone who kept dealing with it, which brings me to another point.\n\nThe vast majority of this is on her.  She brought that trauma to your relationship instead of finding ways to deal with it properly first, or maybe accepting she needed a lot more time to work through it.\n\nShe was/is so infatuated with her dead ex that she didn't give one iota about your feelings here.  It was entirely about her(and him).  No real discussion, no remorse or sympathy, no concern.  Just \"I'm moving out.\".  Let that sink in.  Truly internalize it, and if she calls you any time soon or you bump into her in a few years, be mindful of the fact that she never apologized for hurting you.\n\nThe vast majority of this is on her, but a small part of this was on you too OP.  I'm not saying this to drag you through the mud, I honestly feel bad for you man, but I'm saying it as a warning to anyone else in a similar situation.\n\nOnce you understand that something detrimental to you  isn't going to change, you need to work on an exit strategy.  If you just keep dealing with it, you will most likely end up miserable.  You'll find yourself making bad decisions, maybe thinking that life will get better once you move in together or you start having children.  You don't want to start doing that.  You want to get out and find a better significant other to build a life with.\n\nEDIT: Another thing, since she is able to leave so quickly, was she paying for anything at all? Was she contributing to a good amount of the bills, or no?",
            "Just saw this and your original post and just want to share my perspective, as many of the people saying you should break up haven't been in your girlfriend's shoes but sadly I have. My late boyfriend died two years ago suddenly in an accident, and dating again and navigating a new relationship is a lot more complicated than people make it out to seem.  I will start out by saying I have had therapy, which a lot of people suggested your girlfriend needs because they think she's not over her late boyfriend. Five years post loss is a long time for her to process and accept he is gone, so I really don't think it sounds like she is in the active stages of grief, but the reality of loss is that it's not something you get over or stop grieving, that pain is always there and just becomes a part of you. Some days or events can trigger it more and bring things more to the surface, which it sounds like that happened with the promotion. Maybe how you reacted was a trigger, maybe the thought of you moving up the career ladder that her late boyfriend will never get to do was the trigger ... some moments and life events just bring up memories or emotions.  Either way, I don't think it's appropriate for her to underhandedly criticize you in the way she did for your anxiety, period, but especially by evoking the memory of her late boyfriend. I think it would be appropriate to say, \"I love that you feel comfortable sharing about your late boyfriend because I know how special he was to you, but if there is something about me that bothers you, I would prefer we discuss that directly without needing to make any comparisons to your late boyfriend. I don't think that's fair to me or his memory.\"\n\nI'm surprised you broke up. I think you think she doesn't love you, which I can't speak to, but I do know how much my new relationship means to me after everything I've been through and I think the fact that she was with you for two years means there's something there. Maybe if it's still salvageable you can ask her, what about me or this relationship do you like? What about the relationship with your late boyfriend did you like? Are you looking for / needing those things in a relationship? Or is what we have special for you in its own way? I think that could give you an idea if she's really accepted that he's gone versus looking to shape you into her late boyfriend, which I think is the fear you are expressing. \n\nFinally, in case this helps. My new boyfriend has a lot of positive qualities my late boyfriend did not, and vice versa. I do miss what I had with my late boyfriend and what he brought into a relationship, but I still appreciate who my new boyfriend is and what he brings to the table as well. My late boyfriend was perfect for who I WAS, and my new boyfriend is a good fit (too soon to use perfect yet) for who I am and what I need now after going through two very painful years. Even so, it takes an active effort to not compare when there is any issue with the new boyfriend. One thing I really appreciate is my new boyfriend has no problem with me sharing stories or memories of my late boyfriend. I don't think I could be with someone that would make me feel like I had to shut that part of my life off and couldn't talk about my late boyfriend. When you told her not to talk about the late boyfriend, maybe that's what she thought you meant. Maybe she felt like you were asking her to forget about him and what they had. I think I would walk away from someone who did that, even if the relationship was good. He will always be a part of my life, his family is my family, and I'd need to be with someone who understood this and even sees it as a positive. All this too say, maybe this isn't breakup worthy, but just a communication issue you need to work out.",
            "You did better then me bro. About the 4rth time she brought up what a paragon of perfection her late ex was, I would have given her a framed photo of him with a photoshopped halo above his head.",
            "Well, I think you both could recover from this if both are willing to work on the relationship, but She seems to not be interested on working things out with you.",
            "Good choice. People who constantly talk about their exes are deal breakers. Won't even date them because they're not ready.",
            "She\u2019ll have the same situation in every relationship.",
            "You did the right thing. But still  I feel she just told you \"I am so sorry you feel that way\" instead of at least apologize or talk things... She took it the easiest way for her.\nFuck that, you cannot compite with a ghost, you are the one alive and the one cared for her and loved her. Not him being dead.",
            "I think you should end it once and for all. No space crap. She's clearly been using you as a stand-in and everytime you're not like her ex she's berated you. You can't complete with a ghost, and you shouldn't have to. You should be loved for who you are. And she's shown you she doesn't care already. Let her go, mate. Learn to grey rock and work on yourself.",
            "No you didn't...I don't talk about my exs to my wife and she doesn't talk about her exes to me....its unhealthy if you wanna have a long term relationship",

            "anyone who compared me loses me \n\nyou should do that too.",
            "Oh wow. I am going to get so many downvotes but I'm still taking the risk. I am not being sarcastic either, so please don't misunderstand me. I read the first two comments on the original post and I was really surprised at how many upvotes they had. They immediately agree AND advise him to leave. This cannot be the only problem they have in their relationship! Also, we're only hearing his side of the story. If the boyfriend died 5 years ago and they've dated for 2, that would equal 7 years since he passed away right? I am so confused and then I look at OP's username. Is it just a coincidence or is it a throwaway account? I haven't looked at his profile and I probably should have before I make this post. Maybe English is not his first language and something got lost in translation? What if her lack of anger was actually SHOCK? Can someone please ELI5?!?!?!?!\nSincerely,\nConfused\nEdit: a word",

            "She deserved someone more understanding and you needed to move on.",
            "Im mexican and one thing that I cant understand yet from americans, its the fact that its so easy for you to move with your boyfriend/girlfriend and live together as a couple.  You dont wait until got marry to do it. \n\nAnd this is one of the consecuences, you dont know for sure your partner and then when something unexpected happen, you have to move. The separation its a lot worse, cause you not only miss your couple, that person was sharing house and bed with you, and that hurts a lot more.",
            "My situation is slightly different relationship wise but it\u2019s similar in terms of how to handle it. My childhood best friend died suddenly when I was 25, I\u2019m 29 now and with time/effort, I\u2019ve finally gotten a new best friend. I NEVER EVER compare one to the other in a negative tone. Occasionally I\u2019ll admit their caring behaviors are similar to someone but that\u2019s it. No one should ever feel like their competing with a ghost, it just isn\u2019t right. I love them both very much and when it\u2019s on topic, I praise my current best friend for dealing with the fact I\u2019m a, \u201cwidow\u201d as we joke and I\u2019ll mention the first but comparing is just cruel.",
            "This was probably inevitable.  You may feel cheated out of the 2 years you two were dating, but you're still young and this ordeal may help you identify potential partners who are not ready to be dating or who may have insurmountable baggage from their past, so that you can find someone ready to love again in the future.\n\nJust as you acknowledged her ex being part of who she was, you will also grow from this life experience.  Take some time to reflect on the good and bad of this relationship and distill from it a clearer picture of what you want in a future potential partner.\n\nGood luck!",
            "You fell in love with your *idea* of her. She isnt what she made you think she was because shes hung up on her ex, and that trumps everything. They arent her mistakes, they're her choices. Everyone has their flaws..  but you were drowning in a hollow love and she isnt ready to be in a relationship with anyone. I do hope you find some solace in the fact that you're you again and not being held down anymore by the weight of this relationship and its impossible and unfair standards.\n\nTo me, being alone > hollow love. I'm sorry man. Congratulations on cutting your losses and the promotion tho!!",
            "People here talk a lot about ghosts and how you can never match that person. In reality she made that ghost in her projection. If it wasnt a dead boyfriend she would probably compare you to someone else as long as it serves her narrative that her partners arent trying hard enough to satisfy her needs.",
            "Kind of ideal breakup if I'm honest.  They always hurt, but you handled your business and she moved on. Good for you.",
            "Hope you find the love you deserve, OP. Take care of yourself and splurge a little more than usual with your new promo. Congrats and bright days are ahead of you",
            "I am ok with my husband  talking to me about his late (previous) wife and other women he has known. He knows I don't want him talking directly to them, I'd rather he be talking with me about them. He is diplomatic and doesn't do it in such a way as to make me feel bad.",

            "I recently ran across an old girlfriend on Facebook. Her profile statement paid respects to her 1st boyfriend that had died in a tragic accident before I had met her.\n\nI knew all about it back then as does her current husband nearly 50 years later, I'm sure. Glad I'm not him and glad you saw the light early on too.",
            "You did the best thing. I was in almost the exact situation a little while back and it wasn't until we split up that I realised just how big an effect it had on my mental health. No-one should feel like a third wheel in their relationship.",
            "OP, I don\u2019t think most of it were your fault. Even if its your fault she is still in the wrong to compare you to her late bf. She isn\u2019t over him and she needs help. It is never right to treat other people less than their worth just because you\u2019re grieving.\n\nAs the other has said, two years is better than twenty. Head up OP. You\u2019ll get through this. Also congrats on the promotion!",
            "Hey man, if you game on steam, shoot me a dm. Helps to keep the mind off things, you know? Sorry you had to go through this, but I hope the challenges this situation has presented help you to grow out of this as a stronger person.",
            "Reading the original post and now the update I wanted to say that you have been in an unhealthy relationship but have figured that out. It's okay that you wanted her to be upset. I get that. You thought that her being hurt would mean that she loved you but her not being upset means that she didn't. I can understand you really loved her and I know it hurts when you have more feelings for your partner than they had for you. But it happens. She was looking for a her deceased boyfriend in you or trying to change you into her deceased boyfriend which not healthy for either of you. Both the partners have to put in equal effort/love into a relationship otherwise the one that puts the most effort/love ends up being burned. That's what has happened to you. Don't regret being in a relationship or don't think you wasted your time. Take this as a learning opportunity. You were in love and happy and that's what matters. If you regret these things, you will only be left with self pity and regret. Take this time for yourself. Do the things that you love and enjoyed doing which you couldn't when you were together or find new things to do. Take care of yourself and pamper yourself. You haven't done anything wrong, infact you were more tolerant and sweet towards her than anyone would have been. You are a good person. I know it's painful because your love was so true and pure. It's okay. Embrace the pain try to live the best life you can. All the best.",
            "You are better off in the long run. I went and read your original post before coming back to this one. She is so caught up in the ex she lost that nobody else will live up to him. She has probably exaggerated all his good qualities in her mind since he passed that she has set an impossible standard for any future partners. You should be with somebody who appreciates you. It can't be her unless she gets some serious therapy.",
            "You absolutely did the right thing. Oddly though, I identify with her in some way. \n\nI never had a significant other die, but I broke up with a girl who I loved with everything of my being almost three years ago. I'd been in love before a couple of times in long term relationships, but nothing touched what it was like for the six years we were together.\n\nThe thing is, it's extremely difficult for people to understand profound loss like that. Not just those on the outside of it, but also the person experiencing it. I was in another relationship for about a year after, and I ended up ruining it because I couldn't feel the way I did before. I was doing a lot of the comparison stuff you mentioned in your original post. It wasn't that I wanted to, but my brain just wouldn't allow me not to. When it was finally over, I had very few emotions about it initially. Thing is, this girl was also great. She's probably the best human I've ever known, so it had nothing to do with her. It was all with what was going on inside of me. It took a few months to really start feeling anything about it, and thankfully we reconnected. We're just friends now, but the pain I was going through almost caused me to lose an amazing person from my life yet again. \n\nThe point being that even though I had gone through severe emotional issues at the beginning of the horrendous breakup, I didn't realize how deeply the lingering effects still affected me. I had felt mostly ready for another relationship by the time the next one presented itself. It wasn't until a while in that I started to understand. That ended over a year ago, and I'm lucky enough to have had the realization since then that I'm just going to keep up with this pattern until I feel like I won't be comparing anyone to anything other than themselves. With that, I've decided to keep myself off the market indefinitely which has brought a strange sense of comfort. So many people don't make that same connection though, and instead do the opposite. They fill that void with other people leaving those they come across in their wake. I know because I've been that person plenty. While I'm not trying to tell you to forgive her, or give her a break, I am trying to say that she may not be aware of how she's still affected by her ex's passing. She may not be emotionally capable of being truly upset over your breakup. That isn't to say she didn't care about you because I'm sure she did, she may just not be equipped with the tools to show it. I say all of this in hopes that your understanding what she may be experiencing helps give you some catharsis. All the best to you.",
            "There is a part of the brain that over-idealizes people that aren\u2019t immediately in front of you, imagine the way you over idealize crushes from time to time. It\u2019s probably what she was doing with the dead bf. I can\u2019t imagine that kind of wistfulness mixed with pain. In any case it\u2019s just something wise to move on from and you did the right thing",

            "Do not take the blame for what is happening.  Relationships require both people to commit equally and you were having to deal with her bring in a fantasized memory of her ex so she was only bringing in maybe half of what she should.  Of course she would only remember the good aspects of him and none of the negative.  There were 3 people in your relationship, and the third person was someone you had never met nor knew anything about.  Bringing the ex is is solely her fault, and she will never have another healthy relationship until she learns to never compare her current partner with her idealized memory of her ex.  All of us can improve our communication skills but that is not what diminished your relationship.  You were honest with her about your feelings, as you should be, and she did not like what she heard.  Not your fault.  You cannot control how she reacts.  I completely understand the frustration you must have felt, so even if you may have sounded harsher than you should have, she should also look into herself and see how her comments were harming you.  You have made the right decision to move on.  Who knows after a period of reflection she may finally realize that her actions were what was poisoning your relationship.  Good luck.",

It\u2019s a tragedy that he died and there\u2019s nothing wrong with cherishing the memories she had with him, but it\u2019s disrespectful to you as her current boyfriend to constantly compare you to her ex, and she was way out of line for doing so. At the end of the day, she never really got over the guy, and she tried to use you to fill the void, but it just wasn\u2019t working because you aren\u2019t him and never could be.

I don't know her and in your first post it didn't seem like you snapped at her or anything (you can correct me if I'm wrong), but the vibe I'm getting between the two posts is that she might have been upset no matter when or how you tried to bring it up. \n\nI can sympathize with the idea of continuing to feel the love you had for a loved one that's been lost and I cannot even fathom the pain of losing a significant other, however, she seems to be holding onto it in a way that's keeping her from truly moving on. I'm not blaming her, but it is on her. It doesn't seem like she is ready to be in a new relationship if all she wants to do is put up a bar based on her late boyfriend that no one can realistically reach. If she can't get past that on her own, she needs to see someone who can help her. \n\nI know it sucks that you feel like you wasted this time and love but try to find the positives. From this relationship you learned that you have room to grow in your communication skills. You know now that it'll be better to address something that is bothering you before it turns into a recurring situation that causes you to have an emotional reaction. Take that and learn from it and apply it to future relationships. It wasn't a waste, it was a lesson that you can learn from. \n\nAs for her, her lesson is likely going to be that she's not ready to move on and that she won't be ready for another serious relationship until she can be in one without comparing her living partner to her late one. \n\nI know it hurts now but now you can live your life free of the shackles of unattainable expectations.

It's an impossible standard to be held to, and so hurtful and unfair to you. Hopefully your ex will take the time she needs to heal before moving on. You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you for the person you are! If possible, you may want to look into some therapy for yourself.

For me, i talk about him on his birthday and the day he died, or occasionally if I'm feeling really down about it. I didn't get into a relationship until i felt i was ready, because it's not fair to a partner to use them as a crutch to heal from a loss like that. What your ex did was really hurtful, i wish all the best for her and hope she can heal from her trauma and not be cruel to her next partner. \n\nI genuinely hope you can heal quickly from the distress she caused you and im sure you'll find someone who is loving and kind and treats you as your own person, instead of comparing you to anybody else.",
            "It is okay to be hurt and miss her, even though you know logically this was not the right relationship at the right time.  Please don't fall into the trap though of thinking this time was a waste. You learned things about yourself, about how you want to communicate in future relationships, what kind of boundaries you want to set, and how you want to be treated.  These are all very important lessons.  A relationship ending does not have to be thought of as a failure, but just as a natural ending to something that was no longer working for you.  What would have been a failure is if you two had spent the rest of your lives together, unhappy and unable to talk about it.\n\nYou're doing great.  I wish you all the best in the future as you move forward, heal, and hopefully one day find someone to settle down with who treats you the way you deserve to be treated.",

Realize that no one is perfect, but as long as we find the time to recognize that we were wrong and apologize and grow from it that's what matters most. Her situation is pretty sad, but she can't bring in someone new into her life with that attitude and that pain, plus she's basically idealized him into this perfect boyfriend image that's going to be impossible to compete with.",

I\u2019m now repartnered and my fianc\u00e9 is very kind and gentle with my grief. I tell him stories about my late husband, especially memories with (and for) my kids. But it\u2019s never a comparison thing, ever. It doesn\u2019t even feel like one to me- they are totally separate people and we have totally different relationships. I am crazy, head over heels in love with my fianc\u00e9, and we have a really great relationship. I know he\u2019s said to me that sometimes he feels like he\u2019s competing with a ghost, but I try to hear and understand him and do what I can to alleviate that. Meanwhile he is very gracious and leaves room for me to grieve whenever it happens. I am just telling you this because it is certainly possible to have a \u201clost love\u201d and also have a wonderful current love, without compromising anything. While I\u2019m entitled to my grief (not like I have a choice) I\u2019ll tell you it tends to be my \u201cfriend\u201d that I miss, not my \u201chusband\u201d if you can compartmentalize that.  It\u2019s the memories and who I was that I miss too. I\u2019m rambling now. But I wish you well. I\u2019m glad you handled this the way you did. I hope she can do some reflection and learn to have a healthy balance between her grief and her future.",
            "She probably shouldn\u2019t have kept on bring up her late boyfriend and comparing you to him. To me the fact that she didn\u2019t seem upset when you told her you need some time away from her might be a red flag, but thats just my opinion.",
            "Dang she should\u2019ve at least apologized to you sincerely and acknowledged where she went wrong...hopefully she will one day :/",
            "Seemed like she hadn't moved on yet with the past bf... this is a battle She have to do herself to get better in relationships. The decision you made was good.",
            "Breakups always hurt no matter the reason. Sounds like you did the right thing for you both. You\u2019ll get through this and be a better man for it. Try not to let her comments hurt you. I would hope it wasn\u2019t an intentional thing to do. But it would hurt my feelings too. Probably hers too, if the tables were turned. Best wishes!",
            "You did the right thing. The other commenter was right about not being able to compete with a ghost. I am sure her ex was lovely, but he wasn't a perfect person either and it seems that she has built him into a fantasy in which it will be very hard for anyone to compare.",
            "Oh wow. This touched a nerve. Honestly I\u2019ve been living with my partner for about a while now and so many times he talked about his late gf. And rightfully so, she had died by suicide not even all that long ago, late 2019. And they weren\u2019t fully broken up yet. \n\nHow perfect she was though. I\u2019ve heard about it all year. And I agree, I knew her and love her too, she is effing beautiful and talented and smart and did I say beautiful? Just in every way. But I think as perfect as she was, she just couldn\u2019t be her own mind\u2019s idea of perfect. :(\n\nAnd ya. It\u2019s hard to compete with a ghost. I can\u2019t. No one can. She\u2019s even more perfect in her absence somehow. The pain is everywhere. \n\nAnd I hate to admit it but I\u2019m suffering a ton. I won\u2019t say my partner outright compares me, but I feel that anyway. And it just sucks. And he\u2019s probably moving out soon, we just started those talks. \n\nI hope I can feel better too. I honest to god just feel endless heartbreak\u2014over her death, his endless heartbreak, and the heartbreak I\u2019m nursing now too. I hope it can get better :(",
            "You made the right decision. She wasn\u2019t over him and still isn\u2019t.",
            "I'm glad you had the guts to stick up for yourself like that. \n\nEither she hadn't properly grieved or she got too comfortable with talking this way without thinking about how it would make you feel. And either way does not make for a good partner or relationship.\n\nGood luck and I hope the next person you meet appreciates you for you.",
            "\u201cI know it\u2019s ugly but some part of me wanted her to be upset. Some proof that she cared for me?\u201d\n\nThis line reminds me of Ben Folds Five song- \u201cSelfless, Cold & Composed. \u201cDon\u2019t just stare like you never cared, cos I know you did\u201d.\n\nIf it makes you feel any better, sometimes it\u2019s not for another couple of months or even years before someone can realise what they had and lost. Just because she isn\u2019t coming across as overly upset now doesn\u2019t mean that she didn\u2019t love you or realise how much as time goes on.\n(On a phone, sorry about formatting)",
            "If she's still ruminating and mourning like this over her deceased ex, she was certainly not ready to move on to the next guy. But this is **her** problem OP, and if she's unwilling to help herself - be prepared to move on. \n\nIn her psychologic state, she's unfit to enter into a relationship in the first place.",
            "You know what, her dead boyfriend must have liked to bully others just as she cutted you when you were vulnerable and needed a celebration. Think where she learnt that from. You are idealising her, and she is using you to keep her boyfriend alive, by adopting his abusive traits.\n\nYou, on the other hand, the more you blame yourself not being man enough, the weaker you will get. Learn some self compassion your fear deserve warm encouragement, not ridicule. Then, you may be truly strong. It is warmth that makes you secure and strong, not criticism.",
            "You\u2019ll be fine buddy stay strong",
            "It's funny how much of a difference a day or two can make. I am totally with OP and also believe that you can't compete with a ghost.\n\nBut a couple days ago there was another person with almost the exact same problem and he got shredded for being upset with his SO and I got shredded for defending him.",
            "Wonderful people dont use their dead boyfriend as an impossible standard in a new relationship. The fact she didnt apologize for all the times she did it to you, making everything about him, is pretty toxic. She needs counseling because she is clearly still not moved on, and it was unfair to you to go into a relationship and hold you to some imaginary standard of him in her head",
            "I made an account just to write this, you're probably not going to read it but FUCK THAT. tell her if she's not over him then she can't be with you. nothing like having your girlfriend be reminiscent about another mans cock. just think, if he were alive she'd dump your ass in a second. fuck that shit dude",
            "Lol she talk about ex she is not your its just your turn ,she gonna monkey jump with she get bored.",
            "Yeah, you did the right thing. I agree with you that it's odd she wasn't more upset, but some people just take that kind of stuff differently. She really needs to work past her fixation on this guy if she wants to have a successful relationship in the future, and that's her baggage to deal with, not yours.",
            "Hi OP. I was looking for something else when I ran across your post.... it made me very sad because it sounds like you just crossed paths at the wrong time. \nFrom the little that you shared about her, she doesn't sound like a bad person at all. She sounds like a good albeit damaged person. I suspect she knows she was in the wrong and that is why she didn't seem upset or \"fight for you\". Which was the right thing to do because fighting for you would have been misleading when she is not capable of having a healthy relationship with you right now.\nI also understand you being disappointed that she wasn't upset. It is not an ugly thing at all. From the way you phrased things it seems you still held out hope... And that was not foolish. It was actually very smart. I am not saying you \"tested\" her, you didn't because you really did come to the realization you needed time apart and were willing to let her go. But if there was a chance that she was willing to address the issues and work on the relationship, that would have been it. And it sounds like it just weighs too heavily on her for that right now.\nI am sorry you are coming to an empty home. But I shouldn't be. The loss of love is a sadness so strongly felt that regardless on the future outcome (which we all know will be positive as you handled all this well and will only keep growing from here) I feel sadness with you. But the past years you have been in love with her were not a waste. You developed deeper compassion and understanding.\nBest of wishes OP.",
            "This whole things breaks my heart because a friend of mine is the same way with his ex gf. He talks about her all the time, to me at least. And I know he brings her up with his current girlfriend. When they fight I have a feeling he does the same thing your ex did. It\u2019s not fair and you did the right thing. You were trying to talk about and worry your future, and you are who YOU are. You\u2019re not him and you never will be. I understand she\u2019s still grieving and she\u2019s going to be super sensitive when it comes to him,  but it\u2019s not cool to constantly compare you to someone who\u2019s especially not here. Sometimes people unintentionally compare in the heat of the moment or when they\u2019re angry and that\u2019s okay; because you can talk about it and then it never happens again. But that should be it after that. No more comparing. She continues to do it. She clearly still loves him. Kind of like a Ariana Mac Pete thing. \nI don\u2019t see a chance of you two rekindling considering how messed up this is. It\u2019s kind of tainted. Unless of course, she gets over it and realizes what she did.",
            "There\u2019s plenty of women that are open and ready for a relationship m, despite whatever has happened in the past. You\u2019ll be fine without her. I\u2019d be more careful in the future about shacking up.",
            "Its not the closer you get the more you get messed...its actually the closer you get the more you knew about each other and saw what was not good",
            "I have a current boyfriend that used to talk NONSTOP about his ex's and how horrible they were. But after nearly a year I put my foot down. I got his life wasn't in a good place, but there's no point in forcing your other half to hear about it when it bugs them.",
            "Hope you\u2019re staying strong. She\u2019ll never love you as much as her ex. It\u2019s sad. You\u2019re better off finding someone who\u2019ll celebrate you for everything and make you happy"

I don't know how to express my gratitude, but hopefully this update will let you all know what you do here really matters.\n\nWhen I started seeing M, I became obsessed with this subreddit.  I would read it several times a day.  Part of me knew what was happening wasn't right, but I felt like I needed outside perspective.  \n\nMy mother told me growing up to never speak ill of your partner.  So I lied to my friends and even my therapist about what was happening.  I thought it was wrong to say anything bad about M.  I only posted anonymously here.\n\nI needed to read a lot of stories and hear a lot of comments before I understood relationships aren't supposed to be like what I had with M.  I would read a story and see dozens of commenters call a relationship abusive when that hadn't been my takeaway.  It made me realize I might not recognize what abuse is.\n\nI started researching abuse and learned that name calling, threatening suicide, isolation from friends and family, and telling you no one else will ever love you are abusive behaviors.  I know some people will say that's obvious, but it was so much less abusive than what I saw growing up that I thought it was fine.\n\nI opened up to my therapist and she confirmed that all of these behaviors I thought were acceptable were abuse.  I broke up with M.\n\nIt was terrifying to learn that I have literally no clue what a healthy relationship is.  But it probably saved my life.  I was with a man who CHOKED ME IN PUBLIC and I thought the problem was me.  I can't imagine what might have happened if I'd stayed.\n\nMy therapist and I are working on medicating my PTSD and exploring what healthy romantic relationships look like.  I'm having a hard time unpacking the abuse because I'm still learning what abuse is, but I'm talking openly and honestly.\n\nThank you, Reddit.\n\nOriginal post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9y8b3b/m33_disregards_my_f32_overt_boundaries/\n\nTL,DR: My ex was abusive and I didn't realize it until Reddit made me realize relationships aren't supposed to hurt so much.

All different cultures too. I guess it's because of some old fashioned sentiment, but that excuse only goes so far. Well done to any the sympathetic, supportive mothers out there, more of that please.",
            "I read your original post and thought, \"wow, that sounds a lot like my abusive ex-boyfriend\".  \n\n\nI am glad you ended the relationship and are seeing a counselor.

I know people sometimes feel like a failure after situations like these for \"letting\" it happen for so long, but M was actively trying to break you down *and* you didn't get to establish a good baseline for healthy relationships growing up, and yet you *still* managed to break free.

            "I'm so proud of you, OP. For years after I discovered Reddit I was obsessed reading story after story here wondering why some stories were making me so anxious. My ex was not abusive but he was taking advantage of me and I thought it was normal to support your spouse through most anything even when it was damaging to yourself mentally. I still read here a lot but it certainly helped me shape the idea of what things I wanted and deserved in a relationship and gave me the courage to move on. Good on you, OP. Some people never recognize the cycles abuse going on in their lives and resign themselves to it. You're doing really well with seeing how you should not be treated. ",

Don't think too about how you got into the relationship, as much as you think about how to not fall into the same pattern.  This was NOT your fault. Keep up with the therapy, and remember that you are a strong, intelligent, resourceful woman.  Hugs and best wishes to you.  ",

            "The lesson here is that if you know you come from an abusive background, of any sort, you need to be extra cautious. Abusers start slowly, for plausible deniability, and anyone with a healthy concept of what a relationship is won't put up with their shit and leave. Its their way of winnowing down to the people who will endure the abuse. \n\nAlso, more anecdotally, people with a broken \"normal-meter\" stick out to a potential abuser, and they will actively seek them out, like flies to an open wound.\n\nI'm glad you're ok OP, and you're doing the right thing seeking out a professional opinion of what is and isn't healthy in relationships.",
            "Good for you for getting out.\n\nCheck out the book \"Why Does He Do That\", by Lundy Bancroft. He worked with abusive men for 15 years before writing this book and (most importantly) kept in regular contact with their partners. It will be very eye opening. Basically everything we think we know about abuse is wrong. ",

My ex hurting me in private, me excusing it as something I deserved. It took me a couple years to understand what actually happened.\n\nIt\u2019s not talked about publicly enough. The hand that \u201cfeeds\u201d isn\u2019t always a monster, it\u2019s kind and loving...until it\u2019s not. But it was before at a point, right? What\u2019s stopping it from doing that again?

            "Congrats!  I\u2019m glad you got out and are in therapy that\u2019s important.  Not to be that person but have you considered EMDR as well as medicating?  Meds are important and I take them too, but EMDR with them just did wonders for my PTSD.  It\u2019s one of very few approved treatments for PTSD, and might be something to look into now or further along in you healing journey.  Just thought I\u2019d mention it \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f \n\nAbusers are insidious and I hope you\u2019re able to reach a place where you don\u2019t blame yourself for falling for his shit.

That was back in my tumblr days and my friends were really afraid to speak up against him because he controlled my life so much, they didn\u2019t wanna cause something bad for me. \n\nIt takes A LOT of breaking down mental barriers from the brainwashing you\u2019ve endured at the hands of your partner to really tell yourself, \u201cHey, they actually did do something bad!\u201d because you sit there and are so manipulated that you justify everything for them.

There will be respect, communication, understanding and compromising and more importantly, you partner will try bring you up, not down and your feelings will matter even if it's not all easy and you need to work on things.

            "Yep, I'm still learning how to not over react to bad news and being a good healthy partner for anyone i date...\n\nI learned everything about relationships from tv, and not any tv that showed healthy relationships. I sure wish my mom or dad had things figured out before I learned countless bad habits and they became a part of me forever, but knowing whats wrong is the first step.\n\nCongrats! You're going to love life now that you're free.",
            "You deserve all the love, OP.",
            "I\u2019m so proud of you for opening up and saying that you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect. I understand the feeling that you shouldn\u2019t say anything negative about your partner, even to a therapist. I wouldn\u2019t call my ex abusive, but he did make some mistakes and have some habits that caused me a lot of anxiety and self esteem issues. It just felt weird talking about it with someone who until then had only heard about the happy loving parts of our relationship. I think I didn\u2019t want people to think he was a bad person and like feel bad for me. Now I feel like it was weird of me to not talk about it. It\u2019s definitely one of those things that seems so obvious from the outside or in hindsight. I hope you find someone who treats you well and makes you happy. ",
            "I understand, probably all to well. I have also left an abusive relationship. I\u2019m sorry that your experience with the cops was crap... they should be there to help you. That is so frustrating and defeating! But I\u2019m glad you are out of this relationship, regardless. I was able to get some help from the police, but I too, just disappeared. It felt safer. I moved across the country and only told a few really close friends and family members. Changed my number, email, social media profiles shut down and a new ones set to super private settings with a fake name... I don\u2019t post pictures of my face and I don\u2019t go out. I work. I go to school. I live alone thousands of miles away, where no one can find me. I finally feel some freedom and some joy. It is possible, and I\u2019m rooting for you! Go get your life, girl! I\u2019m wishing you all the best! Love and light! ",
            "I'm so happy that you're out of that relationship. I was in your shoes once and understand how hard it is to walk away and accept that it was abuse. I wish you well in your healing journey. I left my abuser 3 years ago and now I'm engaged to an amazing and wonderful man. Stay strong and know that you are not alone. ",
            "For PTSD, may I suggest EMDR? It is weird, but it works. Proven!",
            "I'm really glad that you're out of this terrible relationship and wish you the best of luck in finding healthy, satisfying love in the future.  I would suggest reading up on what a \\*wonderful\\* relationship looks like, with books by John Gottman and Sue Johnson as a start. They show that loving partners consistently show each other affection and emotional support, have a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions even during a conflict, find ways to deal with conflict without hurting or demeaning one another, and respect each other. Reading up on WHAT to look in a partner is very empowering and will help you moving forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck!",
            "It's very common for women who grew up in abusive households to end up in abusive relationships because their normal meter is off, so don't blame yourself too much. Choking is actually a bug indicator that the abusive man will murder the partner at some point in future.\n\nI'm glad you're getting help, take care of yourself.",
            "Omg I'm so glad this place was able to help you. That is awful and I'm glad you are free of him. I hope you and your therapist can work on the other issues that have come up from this situation and your past. Good luck OP! You are worth it! ",
            "What if all these things happened to me but over a very stretched out period of time, and it was a very long time from the choking insident and they showed improvement. ",
            "I know it's off topic, but I didn't know you could medicate PTSD. I hope you don't mind me asking, but what medication can/do you take to medicate it? Have been struggling for nearly 10 years and would love to know of anything I can do to help it. Also, on topic, good for you for realising what kind of relationship you were in, and getting out of it. I hope life only gets better for you from now on xx",
            "So proud of you, MangoMussolini. \ud83d\udc95",
            "I'm happy you got away! Seems like you grew up in an abusive household so I probably wouldn't take relationship advice from your mom moving forward.",
            "Did you notify the police that he has both physically and sexually assaulted you IN PUBLIC? Because, sad to say, guys like this don\u2019t usually change. If he is this bold... what happens behind closed doors can be terrifying. I\u2019m glad you are safe and out of this relationship, but what about the next girl... \n\nPlus: A restraining order will tell him your serious, and if he violates that and tries to push your boundaries further, it can be helpful in protecting yourself. \n\nYou absolutely don\u2019t have to do this, only if your comfortable and feel safe doing so!! I think anyone in your position should take a look at this as a consideration. If you\u2019re not sure, it might even be a good conversation to have with your therapist, if you haven\u2019t already.\n\nSending you positive vibes and love!!  Thank goodness you\u2019re alright!!!

He wrote me a long email back, which was very surprising to me since he doesn't like to show emotion in any way. He said he feels as if he's become a shell of a person and that he would really like to work on things. I agreed to try, vowing to myself that something major had to change.\n\nDuring all this, I bought 'Attached' by Amir Levine (after a few commenters suggested it). It completely changed my outlook. I identified so strongly with the anxious attachment style and I really felt my boyfriend was avoidant. A lot of our problems made sense. I started to work on sorting through those issues individually in therapy. I tried to put a stop to my protest behaviours completely (threatening to leave during fights, ignoring messages in hopes that he'll 'miss me', asking for reassurance often). I even recommended that he read the book. He read the first chapter and immediately agreed that we were anxious/avoidant.\n\nOver a month later, I've felt a growing distance. The future is looming and decisions need to be made. I started doing more without him. Looking at flats alone for once. Yesterday, after weeks of not discussing 'the relationship', I asked him if he felt a disconnect too and he said he did and was glad I said it. We then agreed that it wasn't working and likely never would due to our differences. \n\nI'm pretty devastated. We ended on incredibly good terms and I still think the world of him. It's hard for me to know if I'm doing the right thing or if I expect too much. He's such a stable, solid, kind presence in my life and I feel thoroughly alone. I do realise that I went through this for a reason, it's just hard to remember that right now. It's just very raw at the moment. I'm hoping time heals all wounds and this isn't something I grow to regret. \n\nThank you to everyone for your support on the last post. It's really helped me get through all this so far. I go back and read the comments every time I wonder why I went through with this. \n\ntl;dr I tried to make it work with my boyfriend after realising we have different needs. It didn't work out and we ended civilly. I'm feeling shattered and scared, but hopeful I made the right decision.",

            "It sounds like you made the right decision. Be kind to yourself during this time :)",
            "I am also an anxious attachment style, and read that book. It was a light bulb moment - why some relationships I was so overly invested, yet so insecure, with my then-avoidant partners, and why I rejected all secure attachment partners. I want to offer you reassurance, an anxious attachment style can be made more secure by an understanding secure partner. I really thought I was so broken, but when my met my now-husband he was so patient with me, he knew when to reassure me and when to (gently) challenge me to trust more. You can get there, just be careful and steer clear of future avoidant types, which will only reinforce an anxious attachment.",
            "Wow... I read both posts. That's an amazing tale of life. I think you did the right thing, for both of you, for whatever the opinion of a stranger is worth. I don't know what I would do without my boyfriend - hopefully I could handle situations like this as well as you did.",
            "I remember your post! I didn't comment but I did relate. \n\nI dated a guy a lot like this for just under a year. Eventually I realized he was just someone with no real social or emotional needs. It seems completely alien to me, but that's who he was.  \n\nI believe he did care about me inasmuch as he can care about anyone. But the thing is, having me or ANY partner didn't add to his life, any more than not having one left something missing. \n\nHe'd been a shy, nerdy, very late bloomer so maybe he just learned to be solo. I'm not exactly sure. But I'm a fairly emotional person. Not that I'm ruled by emotions or can't think logically, but my gut level response is usually \"How do I feel about this\" and THEN \"What do I think about this\". \n\nHe just seemed to have no opinion, passions, or preference towards or against anything at all. \n\nAnd so we just weren't right for one another. I'm not sure, ultimately, who WOULD be right for him, but my way of thinking and living probably leaves him asking the same question. Like \"Who cares that much about dinner? About politics when nothing one person does will change the world anyway? Well, I hope she finds another weirdo who does.\"\n\nKinda sounds like the same situation with you and your ex. I admire how you handled it. You both tried and found it just wouldn't work. Fair enough. You parted with respect and that's the best anyone can hope for, sometimes.",
            "There's always that initial \"did I make the right decision?\" right after a break-up, no matter what terms it ended on. It sounds like you did right by you and that is what's most important. Be kind to yourself and take some time to find happiness on your own \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Wow. Reading your first post was like looking in a mirror for how my current relationship is going (minus the long distance. We moved in together 4 months ago and somehow I've never felt farther apart from him). I'm glad you were able to recognize that the relationship was no longer having a positive affect on your lives, and are moving on to better things.

YOU DID THE RIGHT THING. Hooray! \ud83d\udc4f",
            "I just ended a relationship like this and I gotta say you\u2019re doing the right thing. Took me a few months to get over it but I realized that no matter how great he was, I can\u2019t spend my life compromising on my needs.

Time does heal wounds and I think that with distance, this will feel more and more like the right decision. \n  \nAdditionally, think about how much you are moving forward with respect to your interpersonal behaviors. You're working on addressing your behaviors that create problems in a relationship (of any kind) and you are able to articulate your needs. It doesn't sound like he was willing to make the same effort. \n  \nI wish you all the best.",

            "I really think you made the right decision. I read your first post and honestly couldn\u2019t understand why you\u2019d stay with someone that disinterested. You deserve someone who can\u2019t wait to see you, can\u2019t wait to hold you etc. Not someone who will shrug and do it to \u2018appease\u2019 you. Eesh what a depressing situation to be in. Wishing you better in future.",
            "I think you're describing something pretty incredible - you struggled in your relationship with this guy; you worked out what was going wrong, and you did research and self-examination and determined that you had your own issues going on and you worked on them, and you successfully communicated your concerns to your boyfriend and you both worked on yourselves and tried to make it work... And you came to the mutual conclusion that it wasn't working and that breaking up was best. This sub loves to celebrate \"communication saves the day\" events, and you might think this isn't a case of that because you ended up breaking up but I think it absolutely is. It sounds like you both handled this amazingly, with thoughtfulness and self-reflection and good faith, and it's unfortunate that it revealed that you are incompatible here and now but maybe it revealed it in a way much more enriching and less damaging than other ways could have.\n\nI understand you feel shattered right now. This was someone you loved and possibly thought you'd live your life with. But from what you wrote, I think years from now you'll look back on this relationship and period of your life as an excellent time of growth and self-discovery - not to mention learning about relationships and love with someone. Dan Savage says you shouldn't define the success of a relationship on whether it ends with the death of one or both parties, and I think this may be a good example of that.",
            "Time to rely on your friendships and family, girl!! \n\nFeel sad and alone? Call a friend and tell them, then have a chat or ask if you can come over for a movie night/dinner because you'd like the company. Go stay with your parents or sibling for a weekend. Start a new class or join a local interest club (There are many local hobby societies you can try out- I love mushrooms and orchids and there are clubs near me for those things). \n\nRemember that it's okay for a relationship to end because it was good but not great. Remember there is probably a great relationship waiting out there for you with someone who matches you much better than your ex boyfriend. \n\nBest wishes, better healing, and all the luck to you!",

            "I'm sorry you are devastated. You both handled this so gracefully, didn't try to change each other, respected each other's differences, and let each other go before you hated each other. \n\nWhat you did was real love. Not all love stories mean a long term romantic relationship. Sometimes it's letting people be their best selves, and honoring who they are. I hope you feel very proud of yourself. Sometimes a break up is easier when it's full of anger and contempt, because then you're happy to be apart. \n\nI had a hard breakup where we loved each other but were never going to be the right person for each other. It was hard to walk away from something that isn't awful, but knowing it will never work. I was ten years older than you before I learned how to do that. \n\nI promise time will heal (perhaps more slowly than you'd like) and you will look back and be proud of how you handled this, happy for his successes and knowing that you treated him well. And with such a better idea of what you need from someone going forward.",

Our relationship ended today and yes I read that book and we decided to try again (one of many trials) but he just could not meet me in the middle. It got to a point where I begged him to show up for me and reassure me. He chose abandonment and I'm accepting that it's just never going to work out. With an anxious-avoidant dynamic you are either both doing the work to meet each other's needs or you're miserable. I will warn you that with time he WILL come back with shining promises so definitely focus on moving on now but be ready to not be tempted to go back because he will come back to try again. This is one of the most toxic dynamics and it can literally last decades if you're not aware and careful.",

            "This is a great outcome. While you feel hurt now, know that hopefully one day you\u2019ll meet the person who has the same priorities in a relationship as you do.

            "This is an incredible and healthy way to end a relationship that isn't working. Reading the first post made me upset on your behalf, then I read the update. It helps remind me that a lot of the people these posts are about don't have to be monsters. It is heartbreaking that you two decided that your dynamic was not sustainable, but it is also not uncommon. I had a past relationship that ended because we were not compatible, and we are still good friends. Having these conversations with one another however, was very mature.",
            "What you have written in these 2 posts reminds of of my marriage to my ex. We were together for 10 years total. He was a decent man. Kind, clean, thoughtful in some things. But our love languages and need in a relationship were so different. Combine that with differing interests that continued to get even more different as time when on. We decided to split, it was amicable. My relationship with him helped me determine what I actually needed in a relationship and I kind of held strong to the love languages, I know you can't put people in a box, but the basic principal is if I need something in a relationship that you don't and you have no interest in helping me obtain it, we've become in compatible. Now, there were other issues but the basic one is I needed cuddling, flirting and some quality time. He didn't need those things and didn't make time for them and didn't want to. We split and it hurt but it was best.  \n\nI have now been with my current SO for almost 3 years and he is opposite of my ex. Sweet, loving, considerate, willing to discuss the relationship and our needs openly. We have similar hobbies and love doing everything together. We honestly have to make an effort to do things away from each other. In our 3 years we've only grown closer and not further due to \"settling\" (honeymoon phase ending). \n\nI think as long as you've learned from this and now know what to look for and make sure you take steps to ensure your next partner is better, that you won't have regrets. Your SO doesn't have to like everything you do but they have to be willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. Just because it isn't important to them doesn't mean they should ignore it or 10 years from now you'll feel miserable, lonely and like you wasted a lot of time. At least I did.",
            "Honestly, my husband and I have extremely different attachment styles. I am like your ex. I don't always need attention. In fact, there are times where I need to be alone. My husband and I worked out compromises. \n\nNone of what I'm going to say matters anymore but consider it for the future.\n\nI think the problem is you've focused on how he feels about it instead of what you each need. In a relationship, you're not always going to feel the same way about the same thing. It's impossible to find someone like that and honestly would you even want it.\n\nThe solution is to form compromises that help both of you achieve a mutual goal. Seeing each other on a regular schedule that was agreed upon by both of you would have been helpful. \n\nYou can't just tell your partner to change their feelings. But you can ask them to change their behavior as long as you're reasonable about it.\n\nFor example, I curse a lot. My husband asked me not to curse so much when I'm upset because he finds the words triggering. That's something I can agree to. If he had asked me to stop being so angry about something, I wouldn't have been able to comply with that.\n\nTelling him \"I want you to want to see me more\" is asking him to do the impossible. But if you just ask to see him more them you can work out an arrangement.\n\nYou can't ask people to change who they are. You can ask them to change the way they treat you.",
            "OP, I wish I had seen your first post - I dated a guy for about 3 years who acted in an extremely similar fashion. After some therapy and a lot of stress, we came to some likely conclusions:  namely, that he identified as asexual/aromantic and was probably on the higher end of the Autism Spectrum with significant anxiety. \n\nWe went our separate ways this summer because of our different needs, but hope he's doing okay.",

            "Even though it wasnt a comfortable or easy decision it sounds like you did right by you and are looking for and taking advantage of opportunities for growth and happiness.\n\nIt might also be helpful to note that folks who aren't securely attached can move along the spectrum from anxious/avoidant/disorganised etc to secure - and for folks who date someone securely attached the behaviours can change within 4-5 years. \n\nI can't find where I got that info but I will search, and my trauma informed therapist confirmed that it was correct.",
            "There's nothing harder than breaking up with someone amicably because you realize you need different things and it's not working out. Without that hatred on someone's end, it makes it very easy to not get the distance you should and keep going back to each other. You'll also find many of your friends will see you struggling with it and encourage you to go back because why you broke up isn't apparent to others.",

            "\\> I tried to put a stop to my protest behaviours completely (threatening to leave during fights, ignoring messages in hopes that he'll 'miss me', asking for reassurance often).\n\nI remember the original post and I kind of wondered if there was some behaviour on your end that was making him walk on eggshells. I am so glad you have identified these behaviours and trying to change. I can tell you from experience that these behaviour will kill your partners self esteem and self worth and leaves them into a shell of their self.\n\nOverall I think you guys are making the best possible choice. Both of you should concentrate on your individual therapies before starting a new relationship.",

            "Hi OP, I am the anxious type as well and this attachment style you guys had reminds me of my ex. A good friend maybe, but not a good boyfriend. (With the ex, it started out as a great communicative friendship with shared interests, but when it got romantic, I found myself always being The One who was begging for scraps of affection I wanted) \n\nBut when time goes on and you would like to date again, it\u2019s going to feel completely different when you have someone who reciprocates.\n\nBeing with my now fianc\u00e9, I still get dumbfounded when he actually seeks my attention and loves giving and receiving physical affection. It feels so easy, /completely/ different from someone who cannot give you what you want. Someone who enthusiastically rises to the expectation, sometimes even giving when you least expect, and makes you feel safe, happy and satisfied even if you don\u2019t exactly speak the same \u201clove language\u201d\n\nYou already seem to have a stable and mature understanding of yourself, communication and your needs. When you\u2019re with someone who completely reciprocates, it\u2019ll take time to ease into it, but you will find yourself with so much less anxiety, and not having to resort to distressing choices to get your partner to respond. \n\nI\u2019m sorry it ended this way, but be gentle with yourself, get to know you and the things that make you happy, and I wish you luck and love in the future!",

I really hope you're not nearly as bad as I was and are able to still live a good life without him. I don't talk to her anymore. We ended it amicably, but I think we just don't really want to talk to each other because she's busy all the time with school, and I just feel like talking to her would be awkward... Anyways, it will get better. I rarely think about her anymore, and I realized I didn't need her to be happy. You can do it!",

What happened here is two mature people realizing their differences and deciding to go their separate ways. \n\nNot many updates like this one on r/relationships. I'm happy for you OP, not bc it ended, but bc this is a new beginning for you *and* for him, in your own ways.

And it sounds like your ex, as he said \"he feels as if he's become a shell of a person,\" has some issues he needs to work on, and perhaps isn't even in a mental state to be in a relationship rn. It sounds like you both are working on learning about yourselves and changing for the better, and that's great.

            "Oh my fucking god. This exact thing just happened to me last Monday. Like someone else said it\u2019s so hard when you know you could both work if you didn\u2019t have the issues you do but sadly those things are fundamental and mean it would take so much work to.. well work. I feel absolutely heart broken myself, we have a long complex history and only dated 7 months in total but it was very \u2018Carrie and Mr Big\u2019 from SATC. I realised that I put him on a pedestal and became pretty obsessed and even now after our break up I\u2019m struggling with feelings on worthlessness and inadequacy when I know I shouldn\u2019t feel that at all. \n\nSadly I have no advice for you. But I\u2019m going to be going to therapy as well and I hope you and I both can find happiness again someday.",
            "It certainly seems hard now, and probably will for a while, but someday a partner who is on the same page as you will make it clear that this was the right decision.

            "I feel so much for you OP. That must have been incredibly hard. It is obvious to me, though, that there is someone out there who can give you much, much more than what this guy could. When you do finally meet them, you have no idea how incredible it will feel. So while you are in pain and mourning now, there are far better things to look forward to that will rearrange how you see this chapter forever. Cry it out now, tomorrow is a new day.",
            "Proud of you OP, you did really good. You were BOTH honest with each other, which is so rare. I know it hurts now. You did absolutely the right thing. The wrong thing would have been to stay together with someone who says he's a shell of a person. You can't have a relationship with someone who's emotionally unavailable. He's not a bad person, but it's worth it for him to do the work to figure out how he got to that place.\n\nSimilarly for you: you said in your last post \"explore why I feel the need to just be in a relationship, why I don't expect more for myself, and why I don't think I can do better than this\" - keep working on this. If you do, you're going to be a completely different person a year from now and have really good perspective on this relationship.\n\nYou both had issues, and still being together wouldn't have helped you figure those out. You both need to be on your own and focus on yourselves. So while it's sad that you broke up, it's a net positive, even if it doesn't feel like it right now. Breakups aren't always bad things.",
            "Ten years ago, I broke up with my then bf for \"nothing,\" too. We had been together for over 12 years, never wanted to take our relationship to any next level by agreement. I started to realize that while I loved him, we didn't really have a future together because our retirement goals were so far apart, and we were in our 50s. He was a great friend and boyfriend while my kids were younger and he was a really good father figure to them. We are now at a place that we can talk and laugh together and we even have lunch once a year to catch up.  It *can* happen. (((hugs to you)))",

            "Your story is so astonishingly similar to mine--LDR with a \"stable, solid, kind\" guy w/ avoidant attachment style, me w/ anxious attachment style, broke up pretty civilly 3 months ago.\n\nI want to provide you with some hope--I've gone 11 weeks with no contact w my ex, and I feel 90% healed and actually HAPPY.  The same will happen for you in due time. I still have moments during some days when I feel sad about the way things ended and miss him, but those moments are getting shorter and fewer.\n\nPlease know (and repeat to yourself if necessary): Your relationship needs are completely normal, justified, and valid. Your desire for physical closeness and communication are normal, not clingy. And you deserve a partner who is delighted to give you those things because it makes \\*him\\* happy, too. \n\nIf you haven't already, I highly recommend ending contact--as painful as it is in the moment, I strongly believe it speeds up the healing process long term. As time progresses, I found it extremely healing (but hard) to delete his number and pictures, unfollow him on social media, even throw away some things he gave me. It's signaling to the universe that you are moving on and opening space for the right person to enter your life.\n\nAs others have said, there is no time frame or formula for getting over your relationship. A month ago, I was starting to doubt I would ever feel better. I had to read this subreddit (and breakups) just to have evidence that it happens. And then 4 weeks ago, the shift happened for me. And it will happen for you, too! I am sending all my compassion and empathy your way--it's so hard to heal. Be kind to yourself. The only way out is through.",
