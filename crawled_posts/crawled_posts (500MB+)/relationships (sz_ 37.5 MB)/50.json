I need more help. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe guy they wanted took the job - way more than they initially wanted to spend. My friend was devastated. I followed the advice here and told her she did a great job and how proud I was of her, but the other guy did an amazing job and I didn't know what would happen. She was confident that she was going to win - she had more experience with the company vs. his experience & education. At 4:55 she got a call thanking her but that they went in a different direction. HR offered to meet to discuss how she could improve and to stabilize working relations with the new guy. Shortly there after it was announced company-wide he had agreed to take the job and they were thrilled. She took the following couple of days off and didn't respond to text or email. She just completely took some time away (fair enough). She returned mid-next week and found-out that he wasn't going to start until a couple of weeks later and that she had time. Then a company-wide email went out announcing that not only had he finished the final requirements for his MBA and took first place in his final case competition beating every other school in the country but that he was starting sooner than anticipated. A lot of emphasis was placed on his Ivy League education, which really irked Tina. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe would come in occasionally (before his start date) to meet with senior executives and his team members and pushed them to get unvarnished thoughts - a lot of them really complained about working conditions on the team and major obstacles they faced. A few really told him the unvarnished truth. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis start date rolled around there after, and the hype was real. He hit the ground running and his first week was incredibly busy. On day one he held an open meeting where he came in and immediately banned weekend emails (some teams were expected to check/respond to emails 7 days a week), gave staff commensurate working hours to the rest of the company (we never got summer hours or flex time, which he immediately changed) and followed-up on promises made by previous staff. He rolled out new processes, budget models and is a far more effective at advocate for the team - so much so that all the old time staff have become his \"followers\". A lot of people were worried about being fired (performance had been way down) but we're already seeing a glimmer of hope - the cuts he made preserved his staff, meaning they have a little less cash to spend but a lot more bodies doing the work. All told, they're better off now ( three weeks in) than we were this time last year. The staff love him, he's very approachable, informal and because of his connections to senior leaders in other departments, that team gets a lot more attention than we used to. Our old boss was sweet and kind, but she was incredibly ineffective. I'm considering transferring back into that unit because the working environment is better than where we are. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem has become Tina. She's tried to question his leadership, she's openly annoyed with colleagues and feels like she's the only person who doesn't \"see\" the truth. The value in the new guy is his ability to change - our teams work in close collaboration and their team is a lot more productive now than before and are getting better quality work done - they've started conversations with old clients and the business funnel has grown. VPs openly comment that he'll be moved up in short order. Yet, Tina holds are horrible grudge. It's obvious with how she interacts with staff and colleagues; she complains when he's not in the office and complains when he is in the office. I know of a least a few people who are growing weary of this and two have asked me to say something to Tina (since we're friends). Another threatened to go to HR. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor all his connections and Ivy League education, the guy is also a really strong performer. He has an activity board up showing process and change and people feel less dour, except Tina. She's complaining non-stop. It's impacted our relationship to the point where I've been avoiding her. It's been two months since she found out and three weeks since he started, and I feel like \"enough is enough\" that said, she's a single mom and I don't want to see her fired for being silly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm really not good with confronting people, I don't know what I should say. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr the new guy started and the hype was real. he's been great but Tina took rejection so badly that I'm worried she's going to be fired. I'm not sure how to handle this. She's going to get fired if she doesn't stop complaining and people want me to speak with her.",

            "I have seen plenty of people react poorly to a disappointment in their career, and this bad behavior put them permanently out of the running for future opportunities.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a friend, you could say to Tina, preferably with respect to a specific behavior, \"I understand your are disappointed, but complaints like this are going to give people a negative impression of you.\"  You can also try to set limits on how much complaining you're willing to listen to during your non-work time, but the more urgent problem, it seems to me, is to keep her from losing her job over this.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nReally, her supervisor or manager should be the one talking to her about this.  If they are thinking of firing her then they should be talking to her about the problem and giving her a chance to get it together.",
            "Tina\u2019s only hurting herself in the long run. When this guy moves up in the organization, Tina\u2019s the next logical candidate for his current role - as long as she quits acting so unprofessionally. I\u2019m not saying she has to become the guy\u2019s biggest fan; just quit moaning and whining.\n\nThe way Tina behaves now is what upper management will think of when they\u2019re looking at her for other roles. If she can show that she can be professional with someone she doesn\u2019t like, she\u2019s laying the groundwork to show she can be a good team leader in the future.",
            "Dang, yo. He banned weekend emails AND found a way to prevent layoffs? I like this guy.\n\nI'm sorry I don't have much more advice to offer. Regardless of Tina leaving or staying, at least you have a good boss in the mix.",
            "This guy sounds like a human rocket - we had one of those become director of our department once. He was fantastic - and he bounced out of the position less than two years later to become a VP elsewhere. Happily he had laid down a lot of great groundwork; years later we're still better off than we were before he came around. If \"Tina\" gets on board maybe she could be the one to take over when he moves on (as others here are also saying).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat she does with this moving forward is everything. The hire was a professional choice, not a personal one. When someone feels like they did their best and it wasn't enough, the sting IS brutal, but if they can try to see it as a chance to learn and improve and kill it (or something else) next time around.. it may help. Maybe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's hard fitting into the world sometimes. I really hope Tina is able to find a way to work with this setback instead of against it.",
            "OP, I remember your previous post and hoo boy, do I feel for both you and Tina. It\u2019s really hard in this situation. I understand her feelings completely, especially if some of the reasons she wasn\u2019t picked for the job had to do with lack of training in ways and opportunities she didn\u2019t have, like schooling. \n\nThat being said. Companies and jobs are there to profit, and this guy sounds like a scoop for your company. It also sounds like they offered to support Tina by providing her feedback on ways to improve. \n\nAs other posters have said, Tina was considered for the promotion and could at some point move up when this guy does. But not if she stays bitter and at odds with the team.\n\nCould you take her out for a happy hour drink? Let her rant for a bit and then give her some tough love. \u201cTina, you\u2019re an incredible woman who has been through so much and you have so many valuable skills. But you\u2019re really hurting your prospects at the company by badmouthing A. He\u2019s been great for the team. Him getting the job over you wasn\u2019t personal for him, and blaming him isn\u2019t going to get you anywhere. I suggest at the least, keeping your frustration to yourself or at best, working through it, and demonstrating maturity and cooperation by learning from his techniques.\u201d",
            "Tina needs to get on board or she needs to be let go. The only thing she is doing is setting herself up to never be promoted or fired.",
            "This has happened to me twice: the other candidate was chosen and I had to train them to do the job I applied for.\n\n\nBeing bitter for a couple of days or even a couple of weeks is understandable, but at the end of the day she will become known for being a pain in the ass and being a terrible team member... tell her she needs to cool it at work with the comments as they damage her future. If she cannot cope, she should move department or job.",
            "I remember your post. I actually really feel for Tina although she is kinda asshole. I applied for this job, didn't got it but now I'm going to work for the summer in the same place lol. I have to admit, after reading this post I'm scared I won't be able to act naturally around the person who was chosen. \n\nBut yeah, I can see why Tina is bitter. But for her own sake, she should get over it. There's not much you can do. You can always have a conservation with her how she's hurting herself and her career with her behaviour, but it's up to her to change her it.",
            "Honestly, it isn\u2019t your responsibility. Either speaking to her *or* protecting her from the consequences of her actions. I know you\u2019re worried about the whole \u201csingle mom\u201d thing, but in the end it has nothing to do with you\u2014 and it\u2019s not like Tina is unemployable otherwise, she\u2019ll find other work. The reality is, she probably is going to be fired. And going by how she\u2019s acted up until this point, it\u2019s probably going to be a messy and dramatic affair. Why take on that extra stress into yourself?",
            "All you can do is say that objectively the guy is doing a good job, has come in from the outside and folk have quickly responded to his way of working. \n\nAlthough you realise it's hard for her to hear, there's no point in taking it personally. You can't always get what you want in life, and holding on to these feelings is going to hurt her friendships as well as her career prospects. From reading the OP, it sounds like this guy is very sharp, but has also benefited from privilege/connections inside the company, so it's no wonder your friend is a frustrated. \n\nYour friend is obviously tenacious and hard-working, so there's no point in poisoning the well because this decision went against her. This is not how a leader responds to a decision not going their way. Furthermore, as others have mentioned, it sounds like this guy is going places and will soon be promoted again, leaving the seat empty. Advise your friend to take a breath, pipe down and learn from it. She might well get it at the second bite.",
            "Frankly, I'm not really sure why I get all the hate on this guy from Tina's end. Yes, he's benefitted from a ton of privilege that Tina hasn't--but he's also the best choice for the job. Why don't you go to Tina and say \"hi there Tina, I'm really sorry to see that things didn't work out. I know you hate hearing about his Princeton MBA. But listen, other people can tell you're clearly annoyed at him, and it's hurting your standing at the firm. This really sucks, but do you think you could try to cool it and cultivate a better working relationship with him?\"\n\nI get that this sucks for Tina, but it almost sounds like the firing will be well deserved: part of professionalism is dealing with crap like this without throwing a fit and holding grudges.\n\nIf Tina is really upset, she should get a job somewhere else and quit.",
            "One of the most important qualities in a leader is being able to work with all personality types and backgrounds. Sounds like Tina is way too bitter. She should be focusing on continuing to improve herself so that WHEN this guy moves up in the ladder, she can continue to advance in her career. You've already said she has put the time in with this company, I would try to sit her down for a conversation to put it in perspective. It could simply be that no one has pointed out her crappy attitude. Let her know, flat out, that everyone else is on board with this guy, and sucking it up and at least pretending to be on board, is in her best interest too. If she still doesn't listen... she deserves to be let go.",
            "I have personally been in a position where I was interviewed for a job which would have been a promotion for me. I actually got the job being the most qualified candidate. Two days before I was supposed to start my new position, the person who left came back to his old job. I could have been bitter about it, but I chose not to be. I looked at from the perspective that management believed I was good enough to be interviewed for the job to begin with. I stayed professional and did my job. A few months later, another opportunity opened up. A new job was created. The job was not only higher paying, it was a critical job that could have a long term impact on the company. I don't know the reasoning, but the job was offered to me first without any formal interview. Of course I took the job.\n\nThe long and short of it is to advise Tina to don't look at it as a bad thing. Management remembers people and sometimes things will turn out better than expected. But attitude and how you handle rejection can make all the difference in the world.",
            "Tina is going herself a disservice. When I read the description of this in the previous post, it sounded like the hotshot was groomed for the position by the AVP (given the answers and direction the company wanted to follow). But the hotshot sounds like he's doing a fantastic job and everyone is happy in the team.\n\nTina needs to be a team player because the hotshot will be moving up the ranks really quickly and he'll leave the job in a few quick years. She got beat by someone more qualified and her sulking isn't helping.  \n\nMy advice to you to give to Tina is to suck it up and become this guy's mentee (not a brown-noser). If she shows initiative and can learn from this guy, there could be an opportunity for a promotion when he leaves. That's only when she loses the attitude.",
            "I feel bad for Tina. I've been in a similar spot, and even reacted in a similar way. It's childish and unprofessional, but I get it.\n\nWhat helped me, and what might help her, is letting her know how this is affecting other people's opinion of her (without naming names) . This guy won't be there forever, but after he's gone she won't get the position if she continues to drive everyone away with her negativity.\n\nI'd outright tell her she not only needs to cut it out, but actually probably needs to work on reversing the effects of what she's done. She needs go win people back so she's ready for the next opportunity.\n\nAnd since it seems like this guy is extremely talented, it's also an opportunity to learn from him. Top performers like to work with top performers, and if she can show her value, there's a chance he'll be willing to develop her to replace him when she goes.\n\nThere's a delicate component here about age, and how humiliating it might feel for a middle aged woman to have to learn from some hotshot guy in his twenties, but I'm pretty young myself, so I have no advice to offer there.",
            "Everyone pay attention.......Don't be a Tina, Tina will be fired because she didn't get her way. \n\nObviously, HR saw something in this guy that they liked and went after. Promotions based on education alone make very poor leaders statistically. I am an HR Manager, and when I hire people, a hire a personality, not a diploma. I look for so many different qualities. \n\nMany Tina's in the world today. Maybe she should self reflect and evaluate herself. Work with HR, see where she could improve. It seems to me though, she has already made a scene. She should probably look for another job. I will fire someone extremely quick for toxic behavior.",
            "This is not your circus any more.  Tina probably needs to move on; she is probably more valuable somewhere else than being resentful here.  If you do nothing, she will probably lose her job.  If you try to persuade her to act better, she will probably lose her job \\*and\\* you will probably lose the friendship.  If she loses her job, she may need you for support so damaging the friendship right now isn't optimal.\n\nI'd try to be neutral, to let her do her thing, and to really just not respond to most of what she says.  There's no way your taking a side here can help her.\n\nThe best thing you can probably do for her is to persuade her to keep her head down while she gets her resume out there.\n\n\"Tina, the management here doesn't see your full potential the way you do.  You have probably hit a dead end here.  I think you should start looking elsewhere.  And in the meantime, you should probably really just keep a low profile.  Right now, they're all in love with Bill and if you rock that boat you'll just get worse references.  Focus on yourself right now, not on setting the company straight.\"\n\nSurprisingly, when people get fired in situations like this they usually end up much better off somewhere else.",
            "I was in your exact situation, except I was the hiring manager.  We had a very senior person (X) in a niche area retire and it took me 18 months to convince leadership that we needed to backfill that position.  (I was super frustrated. Although it was a key position, it wasn't one that affected C-Suite day to day and it took 3 presentations to leadership to get the backfill - and yes, it took 18 months to get those three presentations on the calendar and I used a different appeal each time - what worked was coming in with a spreadsheet showing what wasn't getting done, go figure.)  \n\nAnother employee (A) worked under X, had similar expertise and stepped in and take over some of X's duties in addition to her own.  (A also reported to me but I will say that she didn't do the whole job X did but she kept the trains running.)  So when we advertised the position, A was the front runner.\n\nThen came the interviews - we had a panel and A came in *certain* that the process was just a formality.  She was unprepared for the questions from the panel, emphasized her experience in her current job and was just not able to say how she would approach and improve the new job, like she hadn't even thought about it.  We interviewed 5 people (including A) and we had a candidate (Z) who already had X's job in another context and who was super prepared to discuss issues in our organization.\n\nSo Z got the job - and A was beyond pissed.  She and I have mended our relationship (I'm her supervisor) but it's been 5 1/2 years now and she'll still go off on it sometimes - including recently in a face-to-face with our big boss.  The boss was unimpressed and mentioned A's lack of professionalism to me.  \n\nThe job is about to open up again (Z is retiring) and I worry that A, through her own actions, has already cratered her second chance to get that job.",
            "I would suggest having one, and only one, heart to heart conversation with Tina. \u201cTina, I understand your disappointment but your reaction is going to hurt your career in the long run. This guy is a talented person and he\u2019ll be promoted in a short time. You want to position yourself to take his place. Please, set your feelings aside and learn from him. Focus on being a team player and continuing to develop your skills.\u201d\n\nThen step aside. She\u2019ll either take your advice or she won\u2019t, but you\u2019ll have done all you\u2019re able to do.",
            "I would have honestly suggested she start looking for a new job (did not read previous post so forgive me if I'm missing something). She's not happy, she feels her work betrayed her and it doesn't look like she's doing herself any favors there. Is applying for a new job possible for her while she continues working there until she gets hired somewhere else?",
            "Thats a tough situation and I think it\u2019s really lovely that you\u2019re thinking about her future but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s yours to singlehandedly fix. You can have a conversation with her and tell her strongly but empathetically that she\u2019s going too far if you so choose - just something brief, simple, and doesn\u2019t go into the territory of \u201cthe other staff and i have been talking\u201d so she doesnt feel isolated. After that, its HR\u2019s problem - chances are, when she realizes her job is at risk, she\u2019ll either get frustrated and leave for somewhere else or she\u2019ll decide its not worth it and quietly simmer. If she does neither and blows herself up, then that\u2019s on her and nobody else.",
            "There\u2019s not a ton you can do at this point. Have a conversation with Tina about it, and if she doesn\u2019t change, then it will be what it will be.",
            "Looks like they picked the right candidate and dodged a huge bullet at the same time.",
            "I eagerly await part 3 where new guy and Tina start their affair.",
            "A few years ago I applied to become the head of my faculty (I'm a high school teacher). I had done the job before, was highly educated, and had the support of my colleagues. I never received an interview and they hired someone external from the school.\n\nWhile I was miffed I didn't get the role, that had nothing to do with the new guy. I made an effort to help him transition and actively shut down gossip about him.\n\nHe turned out to be an unpleasant fellow and began a whisper campaign against me and some other teachers. He made a series of complaints against me to the principal which I was able to show were baseless. I bowed out of it, and eventually requested to work in a different faculty to avoid any unpleasantness.\n\nHe resigned suddenly at the end of the year and I was asked to take over. My principal, understandably, doesn't like having to admit he made a mistake, but he recognised that the wrong person had been employed.\n\nTina is doing the absolute opposite of what I would recommend. What does she gain by undermining him? If he's good at the role, she appears bitter. If he's bad at the role, she's not trying to improve things.\n\nThere is no way for her to benefit by doing what she's doing. If she can't bare to work with him, then she should transfer sideways. Otherwise she's going to sabotage her career.",
            "You said Tina has battled all her life, poverty, racism, sexism, health issues, so she views what happened as just another example of being put down.   Tina basically has one great skill and it's tenacity, and it's her go to weapon, so then only thing she knows how to do when things don't go her way is to fight.    Her whole life people have been putting her down and telling her she can't succeed, and she's proven the critics wrong every time, so she's thinking this is no different.   Except Tina is very confused.  \n\nAll those times she was told she couldn't succeed it was bystanders telling her that she couldn't succeed.  This time was different, in this case she was in a one on one competition and she got knocked out.    Nobody said she couldn't succeed, in fact everyone probably thought she would succeed, but she ran into someone smarter, better educated, and more connected, **BOOM** knocked out.  It happens.  \n\nThe new guy just re-wrote the rules for the job she wanted.   Unfortunately Tina can't recognize that the rules have just been re-written, either because she is convinced that it's just another case of discrimination, or because she's not smart enough, or educated enough to recognize the change, and it's probably both which makes this even harder to address because each problem has a very different approach for being solved.      She won't be able to recognize the rules have been re-written until she can admit that she wasn't denied the job because of discrimination.    \n\nOP, as her friend you need to get the thought of discrimination out of her head, but be warned, fighting is her go to weapon so she's probably not going to be willing to give up her best skill without a fight.  Which means she'll probably end her friendship with you before she gives up her strongly held belief.     \n\nWhen you speak with her you need to let her know that she was the best of the other people interviewed, but this guy was on a different level.    If the interview was a dance competition everyone else came in a did well known dance, and when it was the new guy's turn it was like when Michael Jackson moonwalked for the first time,  it blew everyone's mind and automatically re-wrote the dace rules and raised the bar for everyone.    Don't tell her that she's annoying everyone because she'll just see that as more proof that she's right.   You need to let her know that it's obvious that she's not adapting to the new rules, and just like any job when the rules change the people who can't adapt will be left behind.    \n\nMake no mistake it's going to be really hard to help, and there is a strong possibility that she'll shoot the messenger, you.  So you need to be prepared to have the friendship end.    Honestly this probably isn't going to end well for Tina, even if you do confront her.   \n\nAnother approach is that you don't confront her and let it play out, because if she does get fired she's going to need a friend, and maybe the best value you can add is being her friend after it all falls apart.   Having her lfie fall apart an not having many friends will put her in even a worse situation.     \n\nA third approach is to take her side and agree with her, and tell her it's time to start looking for another job because it's clear they are against her, and her staying just means that at some point they will get rid of her because they don't want the person who is right sticking around to say \"I told you so.\"  This way Tina knows she needs to behave until she finds another job.",
            "Tina is proving that she wasn\u2019t the right person for the job by the way she is acting and it\u2019s obviously not going unnoticed. She\u2019s ruining her chances for future opportunities. I would be cautious at getting too involved. You don\u2019t want to be lumped into a category with her because you are her friend. I\u2019ve seen that happen in my own company where one person\u2019s bad behavior gets applied to those around them-guilty by association. Good of you to be a caring friend, OP, but proceed with caution keeping your professional best interests as your priority.",
            "I work in law enforcement. One of the biggest factors in getting promoted is how you reacted when you didn\u2019t get picked. Sometimes they won\u2019t pick a person just to see this. A person who behaves the way your friend is would be done. A person who keeps a good attitude and works toward their goals will get promoted.",
            "Your friend Tina REALLY needs to improve herself. And it sounds like she has so much to improve on. It was definitely the right decision for them to not choose her even based on her actions alone after this whole thing.\n\n>She was confident that she was going to win - she had more experience with the company vs. his experience & education.  \n\nThis just sounds utterly ridiculous. Seriously. What day and age does Tina think she lives in?? Just because you have more experience doesn't mean you automatically beat someone who has less. Jeez.",
            "Everyone else has already given great advice but I also want to say, I would be careful to make sure everyone else at works knows that you don't feel the same way that Tina does. Tina's basically a sinking ship at this point, she's heading straight for a firing, and you don't want to get dragged out with her just because you're worried and trying to be her friend. It mostly sounds like you aren't doing it but just be careful that you don't get dragged too far into this.",
            "I cannot believe a grown ass woman is pouting like a child at work. She needs to grow up, act professionally, or will get fired.",
            "He brought in budget models before starting?  I wonder where those came from...",
            "This guy sounds like the chosen one who will lead us from the darkness",
            "Tina is going to get fired if she continues with the bad attitude. People will complain about her. \n\nThat being said if i worked somewhere and they 'hyped' a new hire. It would be annoying. Its just the new guy. Also if they hyped his MBA from an ivy league school I would be even more annoyed. I don't care about that stuff. Smart people just care if they can produce. So I can get why people would be annoyed. However, people seem to like him. \n\nI don't know what you can do. If someone is so angry and bitter they self destruct its on them. If it was me and i got passed over even if the other person was more deserving, I would look for a new job because there is no point in staying. However, I would keep my mouth shut until I got the new job because I don't want to get fired. I have had shitty bosses where I had to keep my mouth shut about hating them out of fear of being fired. \n\nI dont know if you can do anything for her, but if she is going to attack a new manager that everyone likes, complaints will make it up the chain and they will get rid of her.",

            "I would fucking hate to be in Tina\u2019s shoes right now. She got turned down for her dream job, which sucks, and everyone looooooves the new guy because he\u2019s genuinely awesome. She\u2019s behaving badly, and she might even know it, because literally this guy\u2019s existence rubs it in her face how she wasn\u2019t good enough. On top of feeling like a failure, she doesn\u2019t have anyone in her corner rooting for her. Yeah, she\u2019s totally acting like an asshole right now, and she\u2019s alienating the support she probably desperately needs. Lots of people in this thread have pointed out that she\u2019s digging her own grave. \n\nBut she\u2019s not being \u201csilly.\u201d She\u2019s fucking crushed. A lot of people would quit if they were in her shoes, after suffering a disappointment like that. Sometimes cutting your losses and moving on is the healthiest option. It can be hard to let go of a grudge when it\u2019s in your damn face everyday.\n\nSo who are you to her? Who is she to you? Can you grab the damn shovel out of her hands, and tell her you love her? Can you summon compassion for where she\u2019s at? Or do you think she\u2019s just being silly and should be over it already? \n\nBecause if it\u2019s the latter, keep out of it. Don\u2019t bring your judgement to her doorstep. If the former, then it\u2019s a lot less about what you say- and a lot more about how you listen to her. Take her for dinner or a walk, and ask her, really ask her how she\u2019s handling the new guy being at work. Then shut up and listen. Empathize. If she can\u2019t let her anger go, maybe suggest she grieve and move on. And if she doesn\u2019t handle it well, then... welp. You can\u2019t control her fate.",
            "You need to sit her down and tell her that not only is her behavior a bit much for you and your peers to keep hearing, but it will actively prevent her from ever getting promoted. It sucks to get passed over, but openly bemoaning other people's success doesn't make her good leadership material and runs the risk of getting her fired. She should take the time she has with him as a superior to learn the skills and knowledge that made him the better candidate so that she can use that to her advantage when he leaves this position. If you're good friends with her and not just her colleague or work friend, it's your job to hold her accountable to uncomfortable truths and not feed into the \"woe is me\" mentality of getting passed up professionally. Let her know that you're telling her all of this because the alternative is someone going to HR instead and getting her blacklisted for promotions or, worse, fired.

She might need some therapy to help deal with it but she needs to realize that if she can't get 100% in line with the new team she should probably quit instead of getting fired since that is where it will lead too.  She obviously felt owed that spot and that it was a done deal. She needs to get over it, accept it and not hold any of that against this guy.  I'd suggest she try and take this opportunity to learn from him since he is the new hot thing.

            "I empathize a lot with Tina's bitterness-- this super privileged dude walks in and wins everything she wanted, and even does a much better job than she could have done, because of the benefit of his education and connections.  His success on the team is due in large part to relationships he has with senior leadership that she doesn't: she worked her ass off for her presentation, but he wins AND outperforms her for reasons outside of her control.\n\nThat said, she needs to figure out where she really wants to go from here.  As everyone else has said, this is a professional situation and she can't afford to sit around being bitter-- she's a single mom and if she tanks her career doing this it will haunt her for many years to come.  \n\nThat's the real challenge here:  not that she needs to \"get over it\", but that she needs a new goal in order to figure out what specifically to do in the course of getting over it.\n\nAs her friend, can you sit her down and talk through it with her?  Like this:\n\n1)  Validate the struggle and how frustrating it feels for her\n\n2)  Work out with her where she wants to go from here.  Does she want to shoot for the job after he moves on?  Does she want to take this opportunity to make a lateral or diagonal jump to another organization?  Does she want to take advantage of this guy's leverage to try to get some more single-mom benefits like flex time?\n\n3)  Once she actually realizes what her new dream is, then it's just a matter of how to get her there:\n\na - if she wants to take the role when he moves on, it's time for the two of them to sit down.  She can transparently say that she was disappointed when he got the role, but wants to build the future of the team with him.  You know how Littlefinger in GoT says \"Chaos is a Ladder\"?  Often in circumstances like this, Awkwardness is a ladder:  she can turn the very fact that they have awkwardness between them into an opportunity to make him her biggest champion, and her promotion changes go up drastically if he's the one advocating for her.\n\nb - If she wants to take a lateral move, it may be an ideal time to apply elsewhere-- her bosses and HR are likely to breathe a sigh of relief and give her a fantastic recommendation to go elsewhere.  Never underestimate the power of other people feeling guilty they didn't promote you.\n\nc - If she wants benefits, well, few managers seem to have the clout this guy does.  Turn that same awkward conversation into \"I know I was an ass but I needed some time, let's make peace and also can you help me out\".\n\nThe ball is in her court:  She's senior, she needs to act like a manger and take control.",

She honestly sounds like she needs to vent a lot to get it out of her system (at least, I hope that that's all it takes). But after she gets her vent time, and some tears maybe, she needs to rejoin reality, where she is a great person and a good worker, but she isn't the protagonist of a grand story, and other people sometimes are legitimately better than her, and that's **ok and not a negative reflection of her**. \n\nShe's been through a lot. She has earned a lot. She needs to remember that, remember what she's fought for, and not throw it away out of jealousy.

It's also not something that your firm is going to go back and time and fix. \n\nCount her blessings where she is. Let go of bitterness. Focus on her own work. Find **joy** again. That's what she needs to work towards, not trying to tear someone else down (even if he were doing a bad job, which apparently he isn't). \n\nAnd once you try, seriously, distance yourself if she continues.

Sure. But some people see someone better at something than them and feel discouraged. Others feel inspired. \n\nBut I think even if she turns it around tomorrow, the damage has been done. Too many people have noticed already, and that's all anyone is going to remember about her. \n\nBut I think she's committed to burning out, and displaying some learned helplessness with letting this take her down. I also think that you don't have to be involved in any way. But it's hard to watch.",

Its ok to feel upset but if you behave like a sore loser, that is unprofessional and people get tired of you. Its happening to Tina.\n\nRight now its good that you are objective and can see the new guy for who he is. I think at this point your friendship with Tina is not the main concern, its how people see you as well because you are her friend. Multiple people have came up to you to voice their displeasure because they know you are her friend. I think you need to be firm with her on how childish her behaviour is and if she cannot accept rejection, she can't lead a team.

It wasn't his \"fault\" she didn't get it. It's no ones. Like you said, plenty of other well suited candidates didn't either but you don't see them acting out about it.

If Tina was one of my friends I would feel the need to get her in a private setting and openly ask her \"Can I be absolutely blunt with you?\". Then give her a much needed dose of reality that she so desperately needs. Ask her questions like \"What is the end result you are hoping for by acting the way you are?\" Tell her your concerns if she keeps on this track.

It. Fucking. Blows. And many times yeah it is because of social constructs, but sometimes it\u2019s not and it\u2019s realllly hard to know the difference (if you even can) and get exactly the perspective you\u2019re offering here, especially when you\u2019re so hurt. \n\nWhich is where you come in.

So I have a mentor that I go to. My mom\u2019s boss is a long-time family friend, a badass manager with three badass daughters making their way in their own male-dominated fields, and I trust her opinion on these matters more than my own. She\u2019s in a place I would like to be, but she\u2019ll also call me out on my shit if I\u2019m hung up on the unfairness of things.

What are you gonna do about it?\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re comfortable mentoring your friend, but it sounds like you have a little more perspective and would be at least a reasonable ear. It might be a shock and hurtful for her to hear \u201cactually I kinda wanna work for him...\u201d but it might be the shock that shows her she\u2019s being a bit harsh and reevaluate her approach.

It actually didn\u2019t help when my friends told me I should\u2019ve gotten the job. \n\nThe truth is management (and a lot of the people who now work for the new boss) see her as a liability regardless of her expressed disappointment. They don\u2019t want someone who was around before the changes trying to validate the old way of doing things (the one she was so proficient at doing).

Encourage her to look for another job if she's unhappy. Don't let other people go to HR and watch her go down without warning her.

When you\u2019re friends with someone who is bitter and toxic they begin to believe that is your attitude as well. Personal example: I was friends with a girl who became known for being a snitch (telling on others for rules infractions and such) so people thought I was also one because I was friends with her on a personal level. Took me forever to shake that reputation.",
            "One of the best ways to deal with change you're against is \"disagree and commit\". If you don't like a change in policy or personnel you can complain, make your case, whine as much as you want before it happens. BUT as soon as that change comes into effect you hit the ground running, working your ass off to support and work with the new policy or person. That is how you show that you're a team player. That is how you become memorable for all the right reasons and how you don't get passed over for the next promotion that comes along. \n\nYour friend had her chance to disagree, but she's fucking up royally being pissy about it after it's happened. For your sake, I would distance yourself from her and her behaviour as much as possible, so you don't get tarred with the same brush. Let HR deal with it.",

The best thing you can do to help her out seems to be to make sure that HR handles this and that the case is presented to them in a way that's not all too unfavourable towards her. If a colleague is already on the way to tell HR then encourage them to do so quickly so they can intervene and hopefully help and support her before she does something really stupid.\nAnd it's not your responsibility to tell her, especially when the message is \"get over it and act professionally\".

Do everything you can to learn about why he makes those decisions, and what his thought process is that keeps him focused on the important stuff (and how to tell what's important.) Seriously, you could learn more from this guy than you did in college. If you can keep up, people like this can make your career. \n\nTina will either get a clue or she won't.

The company will find a reason. \n\nI had the EXACT same type of co worker last year . We merged with another company and I saw her begin to unravel. She couldn\u2019t handle the change and it was bad. Every day I walked in the office, she would be spewing toxic venom bad mouthing our current team or the team we were merging with. It was soooo bad. \n\nBut it was hard to call her out. She was really negative and mean and stubborn (she walked out on HR one time) and I felt if I stood up to her , she would turn on me. She was super toxic and I felt toxic vibes around her. She would twist everything around and make it super negative \n\nShe finally left but her last day she became negative and toxic to me and it was the longest most annoying day ever that I couldn\u2019t wait for it to be over .... \n\nTread carefully.\n\nI would honestly take her to lunch and tell her you value her so much and to not beat herself up and maybe suggest her staying there and building her skills and keeping her mind open to a new opportunity if she doesn\u2019t get what she wants there \n\nAt the end of the day maybe another opportunity could be waiting outside the company",

It feels like they are doing it just because they have the authority. I also don't like it when the new leadership comes in and makes suggestions or seems to step over my authority without talking to me and seeing what my reasoning for what I do is. The thing is, I know this about myself, and I try to minimize any damage by being respectful and being upfront about why I do things a certain way. It is still hard, though, at times. \n\nIt sounds like Tina is having a hard time feeling validated with her responsibilities within the company, and feels like everyone is going gaga over the new guy. If you are in a position to praise her, do it. But don't be patronizing about it. If you can arrange it, have a meet and greet between Tina and the new guy. Let her meet him and see that he is just a regular guy that happens to work there, and he has his own faults too.

I don't blame her for taking some time off to process her feelings. But right now, she is shooting herself in the foot left, right and centre. This guy is doing good for the company. Her resentfulness isn't coming from a place of concern for the company, it's jealousy and spite and nothing else. And she's doing a *significant* amount of damage to her reputation at work as a result. \n\nIf she was complaining outside of work, then maybe you should say something next time you were hanging out. But because her behaviour is impacting her work and her relationships with her colleagues, this is for HR to handle, not you. No one should be asking you to talk to her, they should be talking to HR or her supervisor to have that conversation. \n\nYou really need to step back and wash your hands of the situation. You can't worry about her place in the company if she isn't worried for herself. Who knows? Maybe she's ready to move on to a different company where she won't have feelings of betrayal and resentment hanging over her.

        "selftext": "**TL;DR: The girl my ex cheated on me with randomly messaged me a couple months back, turns out she was pregnant! Kind of got closure, am very happy.**\n\nLink to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9mb89u/girl_20sf_who_my_23f_ex_23m_cheated_on_me_with/\n\nHi all, my initial post didn't garner much attention, but I wanted to give a short update.\n\nI never responded back to Jessica and basically told her that while I understood she was guilty there really isn't anything she can and should do for me. Just that she has to make better decisions now and hopefully her guilt would mean she wouldn't hurt another person like that again. \n\nDuring the Holidays, my ex's dad greeted me a Merry Christmas. I was also told of the news that Jessica was 4-5 months pregnant with my ex's child. :O It lines up now, and I guess that's why she messaged me, because they found out around that time. Just wish she was really sorry lmao. \n\nAfter that my ex and I had the chance to talk. While of course I was still not ok with the fact that he cheated on me, I wouldn't wish ill on an unborn child. He has a lot of growing up to do, and is not the most financially stable person. It also turns out the girl is quite young. I told him that I wished him well despite everything. His dad told me that he still believes he can make something of himself. \n\nWhen my ex and I talked, he admitted to me that the reason he cheated was because he knew I was already going to break up with him. This is partly true because months before, I sat him down and talked to him about issues in our relationship, and I had wanted to bring his attention to the fact that things really were no longer healthy. I guess it was my prelude to an amicable break-up. He told me that there really was a better way to break things off, but that he was too scared to be alone after breaking up. So he made sure he had someone to run to when we finally broke things off. I just really wish we could have ended things better, he was my best friend. \n\nThe news shocked me, but in a way I guess I was able to get closure. I'm currently in a good and healthy relationship and starting the year with a really great outlook.  \n\nThank you all for the advice! I wish everyone had a great holiday!\n\n**EDIT:** Oh wow, I really wasn't expecting this to blow up! I thought my post was locked but glad I checked. I was sick last night and only had the chance to see it now!\n\nJust a few clarifications because a lot of people have questions. I'm sorry I wasn't too clear on the details, as I didn't want to submit such a lengthy post. I realized after re-reading my post how confusing I was! My apologies :)\n\nFirst is that yes, I did respond back to Jessica (the message I detailed in this post) ~~before~~ after (sorry I made a mistake!) the reddit post, but she responded again. I no longer messaged back after, hope that's clear.\n\nYou are all correct, based on the timeline she did get pregnant after we broke up/I discovered his cheating. What I didn't mention or was fully clear with yet is, around 4 or 5 months ago, my ex talked to me and told me that she and Jessica broke up, because they realized that they were in a relationship for the wrong reason. We talked for closure, but I realize now he was also testing the waters with me. I could be wrong tho! \n\nThere are a number of people who also question why I kept in contact with people in my ex's life, or why I even talked to him after everything. I agree that it isn't the most healthy or mature, and I call myself out on that a lot of times. It was just really hard to detach from his family, who I grew close to. When my ex's dad last talked to me, he told me that things will never change and he still loves me like a daughter. :') And while a lot of people don't agree with my last communication with my ex, I think it was helpful for both of us in the process of moving forward. I think we left the conversation clearing out that we don't have hate for each other, just wishing each other well. \n\nAlso, I have to admit that I don't have the most positive image of Jessica, and I watch myself a lot of times not to be hateful. It's hard to judge when you only have the negative things shown to you. She did a lot of hurtful things to me (outside the cheating), but in the grand scheme of things, I really don't know the full story anyway. With how the chips fell, I think all I can do now is wish them the best. \n\n2018 was a tough year. Went through a break-up, was cheated on, lost my sister, had to re-contact my ex to get things my sister used to own back (these are the things I referenced to in my initial post), and basically had to pull myself back up after all the pain and losses. \n\nBut I am glad to leave it all behind in 2018, and I am starting 2019 strong!\n\nThank you for all the positivity and warm wishes everyone! To a healthy year of growth ahead! :) ",

He transferred to Alaska and I didn\u2019t want to leave my life just yet to live there with him. I said the wrong things and we broke up. Felt like not even a month later, he was talking to some girl and got her pregnant. I found out when she was 20 weeks. He apologized and said he didn\u2019t want me to find out and hurt me. I was already moving on and that was a big push forward. It was one hell of a closure. ",

I'm sorry that he handled things so poorly and hurt you, yet if he hadn't cheated on yo, perhaps you'd still be together. As crappy as the situation is, it sounds like he kind of did you a favor.

His other unsuspecting girl reached out to me to tell me the details and saved me from further heartache. They\u2019re now together and he has contacted me in an attempt to get me back. I\u2019m not interested, but should I tell her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: Sorry for the delayed update for anyone that was interested, but I moved and life has been hectic. I read every comment on the original post and considered every option. A couple weeks after my ex initially contacted me via email, he sent me a text message asking if I would ever talk to him again. Like before, I didn't respond. A couple days after I moved, I messaged his gf/the previous \"other woman\" on Facebook since that was my only form of contact with her. I first asked if they were together, to which she responded \"yes\" a couple days later. In a brief conversation I told her that I felt I owed her the courtesy since she once extended the same to me. I told her he had contacted me twice in the last month and gave her the gist of his email. She said she figured that's why I was contacting her, said she really appreciated me telling her, thanked me, and said she hoped I was doing well. I told her good luck and went on my merry way. No catfighting, no unnecessary chatting. \n\nIn the end, I feel bad for her. Yeah, she made the horrible decision to get back with him but I'm sure she did hoping/thinking he had changed. He never will. Men like that don't. I was his unwitting fool for nearly 5 years, now she has that burden. I haven't heard from him since or heard anything from his family who still occasionally keep in touch as to whether she dumped him or not...my gut instinct is she didn't. Either way, my conscience is clear, a \"favor\" has been returned, and I'm still happily no longer with a cheater. Cheers folks!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Contacted the gf, told her everything, she said thanks, we went our separate ways. No Jerry Springer.",

            "Some of these comments seem a pretty harsh way to look at men to me. Society has fucked us up. No where in history have men in general been reliably monogamous. It seems to go against human nature. After all, how many animals have one mate for life? Not many. If we look at actual human behavior, divorce rates, etc, its pretty obvious what the norm is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing a 29M and in the middle of this predicament myself, its a matter of figuring out what I want to do. Of course there is no excuse for dishonesty. I have been open with my partner about my feelings on marriage and monogamy, and she wants to get married regardless. I don't see the benefits of monogamy or marriage. I have asked MANY long term married people to explain to me, almost begging them to convince me that marriage is a good idea. No one has been able to do it. The best answer that I got was from my counselor who has been married 19 years, who said something like, \"being in a committed relationship causes us to grow as people, because relationships are hard\". Not much of a sales pitch to me. My follow up question was, \"If you could go back, would you do it all over again?\" Answer : \"I really dont know\". Not encouraging, since they are both extremely successful in life in general, involved with service work in the community, and both seem to be very healthy people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems like men and women are wired differently. Almost every woman I have ever met wants to get married, almost ASAP. I understand that this is probably for security and because they want a stable family, babies, etc. I believe that most men are NOT wired this way. It is not a moral shortfall, it is simple biology, compounded by our society. Im sure this dude you are talking about probably wanted to be exclusively with you, but is driven by his nature to procreate. It seems phenomenally unfair to expect men to conform to the archaic, unsuccessful social contract of monogamous marriage because that is what women want. The possessive nature of monogamy is a huge turn off for me. After all, I am not only yours. You are not my possession. It is truly ridiculous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust my opinion. Once again, honesty is everything, and if he lied to you, that's not cool. Just keep in mind its not as easy and many of you would make it out to be. ",

        "selftext": "OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4dkl4r/overheard_roommates_2024m_talking_about_how/\n\nFirstly, I just wanted to thank you guys for being so sweet in the last thread. I was so stressed out and you guys made me laugh. : )\n\nFirst update was removed because I forgot a link, but I fixed it. Onto the update.\n\nBefore I posted, I was basically set on hiding awkwardly in my room or maybe dressing more conservatively when I left my room. After I saw all your responses, I was filled with a feminist, body-positive rage. These boys were not going to get away with slut shaming me. \n\nOf the three guys, I'm closest with Tom (Boy 1/3), so I decided to talk to him individually. I heard him coming up the stairs and I just took a deep breath and walked out of my room, smiled, and asked if I could talk to him for a minute. \n\nHe came into my room and we were just making small talk. I shut the door, summoned all of my assertiveness, and said, \"So, I actually have something weird to talk to you about. I heard you guys talking about me the other day.\"\n\nI'd like to say that I threw down with this boy, that I told him that sexism is not cool or funny and I won't put up with it and demand that he apologize. But instead I, um. \n\nI cried. \n\nA lot. \n\nI straight up just broke down, I couldn't even speak. Tom look absolutely devastated. He immediately apologized, said I wasn't supposed to hear any of that, but I wasn't really paying attention because I was just trying to get a grip on myself. There's nothing more awkward than crying in front of someone when you're \"not on that level\" yet. \n\nAnyway, I asked him if that was really what he thought of me. He said no, and that they were just being dumb, and that when Sam (Boy 2/3) brought it up he was really surprised and knew it was wrong but he didn't call him out on it. He said he should have, and he knew he should have, but he didn't want to make a big deal about it because Sam and Bob (Boy 3/3) were just joking around, even though they were being mean. He said it was shitty of him not to call them out and that by not saying anything and acting like it was funny, he allowed it to happen. He said that he has no excuse and he's sorry.\n\nThis checks out- from what I heard, it was mainly Sam and Bob saying the bad stuff. I said I knew they were just joking around but it made me feel horrible to be talked about that way, and that the sexism really slapped me in the face. \n\nHe agreed and said it was horrible, and he also said something like \"not that it's an excuse, but you're really pretty and I think thats why we were talking about you that way. none of us actually believed what we were saying but i think it was just wishful thinking and we were idiots about it.\" \n\nSo for all you guys who suggested that they were attracted to me- BINGO. \n\nI laughed and told Tom that I had a girlfriend. He said that was totally cool, and then looked embarrassed and said they must have looked like complete idiots bragging about how much I wanted to sleep with them. I agreed. \n\nTom asked if there was anything he could do to make up for it. I told him not to tell the other guys anything because I don't really want to talk about it anymore, but if they ever start talking about another person like that, even if it's not me, to speak up. He promised me he would and apologized about 9000000 more times and left. \n\nI heard him go into his room, and then immediately leave and go out the front door. I didn't think much of it and put my headphones in and played Trackmania for a while.\n\nLater that day I opened my door and there was a big cardboard box right outside my door. My first thought was that I'd ordered something from amazon and forgot about it, but it looked like a used box that someone had repurposed and taped shut. I dragged it into my room and opened it. \n\nGuys. It was a bouquet of flowers and a cake with the word \"SORRY\" written on it. \n\nIf you're thinking that I cried for the second time in three hours, well . . . you're right. \n\nAnyway, I'm sorry I didn't throw down with them like so many of you wanted. Unfortunately I am but a tiny creampuff. I'm working a lot on being more assertive but in this scenario I handled it as best as I could. Confronting Tom about it was actually super scary, but I'm proud of myself for bringing it up at all. \n\nI accept Tom's apology. He seemed genuine, and this does seem like a one-off shitty behavior situation. He's usually a pretty stand-up guy. The other guys . . . I don't know. To be honest, I wasn't super sold on them to start with, so I feel like I'll just continue to not pursue a friendship with them. And I'll continue to dress however I want. : )\n\nLastly, serious thanks to all of you for your responses. I was hesitant to post this on reddit because reddit can sometimes be . . . not so nice about women's issues. But yall are cool. <3 \n   \n**tl;dr**: Talked to one of the boys about it, cried a lot, got cake. ",

You stood up for yourself and got your point across very clearly, and there is *nothing* wrong with showing emotion. *Nothing.* Others may say you  need to work on standing up for yourself more, but you did it. So you did exactly enough. \n\nThis whole idea that showing emotion is bad is just another way we play into these weird power politics of human behavior.

Thankfully the fella seems to have a natural inclination towards empathy, even if he went with the flow in the moment. I hope this has cleared up that cloud of ignorance for him and in the future he'll consider the sort of effects his actions can have on others.\n\nI am also one of those people who cries when they're mad, so I can understand how embarrassing that shit is and I'm sorry you had to deal with that. Fortunately, it seemed to help Tom understand you rather than drive him away (as opposed to say, dickhead misogynists who believe women only cry in order to weaponize their tears). It'll be good to have him on your side because I have the feeling this won't be the last asshole incident that will arise with these roommates...\n\nGood luck, OP.

That sorta tension obviously hits you really hard, and I'm impressed you still pulled through the conversation with Tom.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, as soon as I got to the part where you burst into tears, I turned to tell my housemate about it like, \"And she's super embarrassed about it and stuff, but on the bright side that dude is *never* gonna fuck up like this ever again in his *life*.\" There are benefits to being emotional, such as anyone with any empathy not needing any extra convincing that they were a jerk to ya :P\n\nI'm glad you got a decent result out of the whole kerfuffle.

Typically when we joke around calling a girl slutty or some other derogatory remark, it really doesn't mean she's a slut. Like REALLY. Its like when we call one of our friends an idiot or something when we know they aren't. \n\nI've ran into this issue a lot where girls are extremely shocked to see how guy friends joke with each other, but I think there's a basic disconnect in that we aren't serious at all about it. I know my ex girlfriend once got extremely mad because she read texts between me and my friend calling another one of our girl friends 'too annoying to go to this party' among other things referencing her looks. She wasn't that annoying, she was loud and obnoxious, but we were mostly just poking fun at that. Obviously my ex didn't take it that way. She wanted me to tell that girl directly to her face what I said. I told her she should show me the texts she has with her girlfriends about guys, obviously she dropped the argument right then though...\n\nMy point is that guys will joke about everything. I doubt they think you're a slut in a derogatory way. I know this all sounds awful and its really no excuse for being a douche, but this is how a lot of guys talk. Don't take it seriously. Its almost never serious. \n",

I apologized profusely to Olivia and called out my extremely stupid behavior and basically begged for forgiveness. After a couple more days of being mad at me she was willing to talk to my parents and my brother who apologized and told her that they really loved her and that they didn\u2019t mean to hurt her. They tried to explain the situation with my grandmother and why she behaved the way she did and they were just trying to minimize drama but that what she was saying was wrong and they should have stood up to her. My mother got her a gift set from bath and body works, costume jewelry and chocolate to go along with the apology. \n\nSo Olivia did forgive me and my family which I am so relieved about because I really am crazy about this girl. I\u2019m definitely not going to take this for granted. A week ago my brother, Olivia and I went to an amusement park and my brother and her actually got along really well and she\u2019s definitely convinced he doesn\u2019t secretly hate black people. (I never thought my brother was racist - when he was in middle school he \u201cdated\u201d a black girl.) He's only 15 so I definitely don't blame him for what happened. It was my dad's fault for laughing. But yeah he really likes her and is glad she doesn't hate him. My mom invited Olivia to a beach with our family on Saturday (My abuela stayed at home) and although she mostly stayed by me and my brother she seemed to get along reasonably with my parents and seems to believe their apology (she was a bit hesitant to go). \n\nI have told my grandmother that if she wants me to be actively part of her life she must apologize to Olivia. My grandmother actually agreed to apologize but my gf doesn\u2019t want to talk to her and I told her I will not force her to be around her but I did tell her that my grandmother is sorry for the way she behaved. \n\nSo yeah that's my update. I appreciate all the replies no matter how harsh. It really made my realize my stupidity. Still have a lot of growing up to do but I am really happy she took me back. \n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Olivia forgave me after my parents and I apologized and we are still together. She still  understandably doesn't want to talk to my grandmother though. ",

I always tell my husband, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you stand up for me or say anything?!!\u201d If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re actually agreeing!! It still continues 20 years later. Glad you addressed the issue early on.",
            "Look I just read both your posts and I had a few things to say:\n\n1 like a few other people said, you shouldn't assume people don't understand Spainish, many younger people in this country are trying, and many will say they don't understand most of it ir can't speak it because they don't feel confident speaking, but they can understand alot of what's said, as you've found out with your girlfriend.\n\n2. I wanted to say that it's really great that you took criticism from your first post and took it to heart and changed what you were doing poorly with; so many just get angry and defensive instead of learning. ",
            "Just curious - if your girlfriend hadn't understood your abuela, what would you have done? In that situation, afterwards, in the future, etc.? Would you have told your girlfriend about her, would you have talked to your grandmother privately, etc.? I feel like those are important to know.",
            "FWIW, I suspect your behavior during dinner was at least partly cultural. Honestly, when I was living in Central America (a long time ago), the single biggest cultural difference I noticed was how deeply ingrained avoidance of confrontation was, including putting up with way more crap to avoid making a scene. Of course you're American, but you learned your manners from a Latino family, so you have probably always gone out of your way to be nonconfrontational in family settings.  The reactions you got to your original posting were an excellent example of how, in American culture, we have much less patience for this kind of thing. ",
            "The biggest step to being an ally, and a partner to anyone, is to be willing to analyze our own behavior and admit when we need to grow. I'm really happy for your both, and I want to thank you for being objective and open to admit when you've made a mistake. It's good to know you are out there. ",
            "You're damn lucky Olivia is a total sweet heart. ",
            "I\u2019m glad it seems to be working out, I\u2019m kind of shocked at all of the harsh responses here. It\u2019s an awkward and shitty situation, sure, but I can understand your position in this too. People say cut off your family/grandma and all that, but honestly I feel this could be a teaching moment for them instead",
            "Eell.. Grandma needs to shut rhe hell up...and be told that in front of saud girlfriend to show the defense if said girlfriend. Age is not license to be a turd.",
            "Sounds like your grandmother may be a bully. Shame on her and I don\u2019t blame your girlfriend for not wanting to be around her...life is short...who needs it?  ",
            "I'm glad everything worked out!",
            "Honestly I had a slightly similar situation where my racist grandpa screamed at two black kids in my house (not his) to get the fuck out because they were African Americans (he said it much nastier\n\n\nA fight ensued and he tried to run over my mom with his weird gold van.\n\n\nMy suggestion is to cut off racist people, I don\u2019t talk to that asshat anymore and a lot of other people in my family and my life is 10,000x better bc of it.\n\n\n",
            "You\u2019re a lucky dude and I\u2019m glad you and your family are working hard to get over that impression and it was good not to push the interaction with your grandmother, whether she\u2019s sorry or not.\n\nYou got a keeper there, dude.  But always have her back.  I guarantee you this was not the first time she heard stuff like that and it will not be the last.  Even when it\u2019s uncomfortable, step up.",
            "Happy that you didn't just brush this away and instead accepted her feelings. Good on your family for being so remorseful and good on Olivia for holding her ground with your grandmother!",
            "An interesting comment is that racism tends to be of slightly less toxic nature in Latin cultures. And racism, can be also more frequent or even used among friends. \n\nBut due to the toxic use in North America, it\u2019s best to just avoid racism. \n\nSo it\u2019s good to remind your family to update to modern times. \n\nRacists are simply throwbacks to injustice. ",
            "There's a lot of negativity in this post and I wanna say that you handled that amazingly! Honestly this is the way you learn- by making mistakes. So yeah you fucked up but you realized it was wrong and fixed it. I can see why she stayed with you. You're a great guy! ",
            "Thats so sweet what your mom did by inviting her and buying her that gift. Let me guess your grandma is your dads mom?",
            "I am so glad that this Grandmas situation was not a romance breaker.  Please remind your Lady that ( i am speaking as a Great Grandma) many seniors have damage to the frontal part of the brain. (behind the upper part of the forehead) This seems to cause the natural inhibitions and self control to diminish.  Rage, to come and go, or sometimes just totally kills off a seniors self control.  (we have all seen or heard of the mean, angry senior chasing and cursing kids playing in the street.)   Brain injury or diminishing is something that just has to be dealt with the best you can.   It is very possible that Grandma is in the coming and going stage of being able to say things kindly and tactfully and inappropriate anger.  Then again, maybe she has always been a sharp tongued, fiesty Lady.  I hope your romance is blessed with many fine memorable times.",
            "in the future u need 2 inform ur partner that ur family is racist so they can decide for themselves if they wanna meet them. don\u2019t put ppl in situation like that n not even stand up for them??? ",
            "Abuelas can be such putas sometimes. Mine is",
            "I hope she leaves your sorry ass. I am SO SICK and tired of Latinos acting like NO ONE understands Spanish but them. News flash - it's not like you people speak Pig Latin or some other hardly known language that is very difficult to interpret.  Even with all the variations in Spanish from different countries/regions, slang, etc., most people who understand Spanish (even Spanish taught in a classroom) know what you are saying, so please think twice the next time you decide to talk shit about someone in your oh-so-sacred language that you probably can't even speak correctly your damn self. ",
            "and your grandmother is still alive ? SHAME",
            "[deleted]",
            "> People gave me a really hard time in my original post and it really made me realize how much of a dumbass I was being \n\nSo why do you make a second thread about it? The situation has not changed, the situation is still a bad one and will take some time to fix",
            "Honestly that's just part of what it's like being in multi-racial relationships.  Are you her first interracial boyfriend, and vice versa?  As  white dude living in Korea with a Korean girlfriend, people are racist all the time (granted her parents are extremely nice) but of course people say stuff in front of you because they assume you don't speak the language.  That's when you make them know that you know what they're saying, they get embarrassed and it's hilarious to watch.  Personally that's what I would have done.  \n\nSorry she blew up at you, glad you got it all fixed, hope your grandma takes a chill pill.  This is of course the 21st century and there's no room for that in family life.  But still, the whole situation seems blown out of proportion.",
            "Those people who were telling you to \"disown\" your grandmother are the real assholes here. So shes a mean, racist old lady..So what, shes still your grandma. She loves you and she is elderly and set in her ways. \n\n__The people telling you that your \"whole family\" is racist and that you should \"disown\" your abuela are thinking and behaving like angry teenagers.__\n\nWhat they dont realize is that the more you bring your girl around the family, the whole thing will be normalized and your grandma will have no choice but to accept that her grandson loves a black woman. ((Which I'm sure she already has once the family got on her about it)). I'm not saying bring your girlfriend to your grandma if she doesnt want to see her (understandably so). But no need to \"disown\" our fucking grandparents imo.\n",
