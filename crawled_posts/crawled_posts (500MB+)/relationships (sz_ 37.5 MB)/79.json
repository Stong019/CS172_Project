We just had a session yesterday.  Our counselor is wonderful, she really understands the situation and has identified the struggle my husband faces when confronted with an uncomfortable topic, like our losses, stress at work, the decision to have children or not, and more.\n\nWe have spent quite a long time discussing my husband's upbringing.  His family isn't really big on communicating, and there are many problems that he and his siblings have had over the years (and continue to this day) that were never addressed and never resolved.  In session he talked about how he felt his emotional needs were never really met growing up, but that he didn't realize it until now.  It made me really sad for him.  We had his parents over a few weeks ago and as usual, the conversation remained really superficial and never delved into anything very substantial.  I have tried to share with them about our life and our losses before, but there's never been any sign of interest from them in connecting with us in that way, even though his mother is one of the only people I know in my life who has suffered a loss as well.  We spent the next week's session processing their visit, and unfortunately my husband felt a lot of anger and frustration that he wasn't able to talk to them about the important stuff.\n\nHowever, in our relationship things have completely transformed.  We argue so much less, and he is completely present and there for me when I need his support.  The topic of having children has come back up, and we are still figuring that out, but we can really talk about it and be open and honest with each other without fear and with respect and open arms for each other.  He has repeatedly said that he's really happy we got into therapy and that he feels great about the state of our relationship.  I'm almost happy we've gone through such hard times so that we were able to hit rock bottom and get to this wonderful place.\n\nSo, thank you to everyone for your kindness and generosity in following our journey.  \n\nTL;DR: Poor communicator husband and I started therapy and now our relationship has completely transformed.  Thank you to everyone!",

            "Great update!\n\nThis is why I love going back and reading the old posts.\n\n>Frankly, from your post, it does sound like it's too little too late.",
            "My husband's family is very similar to your husband's, and yes, my husband and his siblings all have issues. They bottle things up and then explode. They take things far too seriously and are very hard on themselves, meanwhile, they are unable to acknowledge when others are experiencing sadness or pain and instead see it as a competition. For example, I told them that my mother was seriously ill with cancer. His mother then launched into a monologue about her aches and pains, and his siblings said nothing at all. One of his siblings can't even say Happy Birthday or Merry Christmas, he says \"It's your birthday\" and \"I'ts Christmas and you're here.\"\n\nWhen they do talk, it is about stuff like wine, music, characters in a book. They don't ever talk about how they are feeling, acknowledge anything bad that has happened, what's going on in their lives, nothing beyond a conversation that you could easily have with a stranger. One of them only shows how he is feeling with rants on facebook, which comes across as him having a pity party, and when people reply in comment he angrily rants at them \"I don't ask for your sympathy! I am quite alright!!\" Then he'll have another rant on facebook about people not minding their own business about his life. \n\nWhen my husband told his mother over the phone that we have been confirmed as infertile, without skipping a beat she launched into talking about his sister's choir music. He was very angry and hurt, especially because my parent's reaction was to cry for us and tell us how sorry they are. And that was the tipping point where he acknowledged that his parents don't communicate like they should. Prior to that he always said that I had an abnormally close relationship with my parents because we talk every few days on the phone. (He rarely talks with his family on the phone, not even for birthdays.)\n\nMy husband has been to counselling and we also talk at length about how to express ourselves and how to acknowledge others. He's getting there. When I compare to how he is now to how he was back then, he is a hundred times better and much happier. I actually do think that what saved him is that growing up he was the only one of the siblings that had a large group of friends and was heavily involved in team sports, so he did develop some type of social skills. The rest were daydreaming with their nose in a book or off in lala land playing musical instruments. \n\n",
            "Wow, what an awesome update. Thank you for sharing, I'm so glad things are looking up! ",
            "I am so happy for you. Thank you for sharing!!",
            "Great news for you and your husband. I wouldn't push it with other people. Some people just don't want the burden of other people's problems, nor do they care to delve deeper into communicating other than superficially. I have some people in my life like that, and I am like that myself with some people and some of my own issues...all you can do is work on yourself and your marriage. ",

Keep on at it. He seemed so cold that it's a great surprise he's done such a turn around - it sounds like he really DOES love you a lot. \n\nYou also sound so much happier yourself. ",
            "I'm glad you guys are doing better.\n\nI had a similar upbringing, and may have reacted similarly. I always reacted out of anger when I heard bad news or stressful things. It was how I was reacted toward while growing up. Therapy has helped a lot and has saved my relationship. I hope you guys continue to do the same and I hope the best for you!",
            "That is wonderful news. I'm so glad you didn't take any advice in which \"it was too late\" to get back your marriage. I hope people can use this as an understanding of what actually can happen when people get help.",
            "So much of counseling is finding the right counselor for the issues and the people--and then, separating out how much of the \"couple problems\" are actually each person's individual issues that have to be addressed.  And then as the years go by, the individual issues can change a bit, as outside stressors dredge up long-forgotten \"wrong-thinking.\"",

It is so much more common than people know.  If you are upfront about this I guarantee you will find people all around you that have had miscarriages.  It is something I wish wasn't so stigmatized because you really need the support when it happens.  I wish everyone would just tell people as soon as they get a positive pregnancy test!",
            "This is such a great update! I'm so happy for you guys that the marriage is working out, and everything is improving and a lot healthier!\n\nThank you for updating us! :)",
            "Very happy for you both. I recognized much of what you wrote. The best of luck to you both.",
            "Yay!  Nice to see things turning out so well for you and your husband.  \n\nI've (61F) been through numerous challenges in my life and it took a while but eventually I realized something... and this quote says it all.  \n\n*\"Whenever you are in the midst of a crisis, stop and say thank you\u2026 because you are about to learn something on the other side.\"*  \n\nYou are sure to run into problems in the future.  That's unavoidable and something you can't control.  What you *can* control is how you approach your problems.   Next time... look for the silver lining.  Look for the life lesson.  There can be something enriching and valuable there that will enhance your life.  Go find it.  \n\nAnd also... if you don't learn the lesson, the problem will come back in one form or another till you do.  Which brings me to another quote that I'll leave you with, and explains why I'm telling you this..\n\n*\"Learn from the mistakes of others.

            "Is it possible there's an impulse control issue? That's what first comes to mind for me with the zit comment and the immediate \" then we won't have kids\" when the conversation got uncomfortable. Are there other ways he shows poor impulse control? I just imagine him so distracted by the zit it's an itch he has to scratch, or so unable to be uncomfortable with your infidelity he punches the eject button right away. Does he often make social gaffs, interupt, make bad decisions? I've taught a lot of kids with fetal alcohol syndrome and these behaviors of his remind me of them."

        "selftext": "My fiance and I are getting married over the summer (we've been together 4 years). We decided on a very informal courthouse wedding and the two of us decided to elope/honeymoon internationally after. Well, this was heartbreaking to our parents and my mom threw a fit and tried to bargain and bully her way into getting her way. I gathered all of my strength from the spirit of past r/relationships posts and put my foot down. I had a change of heart a few months later though.  I have a good relationship with my MIL and I wanted her to be able to see us get married. Fiance and I decided to invite the parents for the weekend of our courthouse wedding. We planned some photos and simple dinner and THAT'S IT.\n\nMy mom of course took this as an invitation to start planning a wedding for us with a fancy cake and extravagant dinner. I just let her make these plans and not acknowledging them, instead reiterating my own. It seems to be working so far, except when it comes to the dress.\n\nBackstory: My mom has always used money as a tool for emotional manipulation. Even when I was a child, she would spend her \"last dollars\" on something and bring it up FOREVER. She would talk about how she was poor and didn't have any clothes without holes in them because of me and my medical bills or things that I \"wanted\".  She would tell people on the street that she couldn't afford a haircut or dental work because of me. I separated myself from my parents financially as soon as I got to college and have a lot of debt as a result. I really couldn't handle the constant guilt trips even if it meant working full-time my freshman year. I stopped asking for anything at a young age and I still have a huge aversion to asking anyone for anything or receiving gifts. A few years ago, my parents took a page from Wesley Snipes' book and are now in a pretty bad financial situation. This makes my mom even more of a martyr when she sends me (unsolicited) gifts.\n\nThe first time I told her about the wedding, she said, \"I don't have any money, but the dress is MINE!\" meaning she would buy it for me. She talked up the experience and is clearly looking forward to shopping with me. I don't mind the shopping aspect, but I don't want her to make this all about the sacrifice she made for my \"special day\". I will literally have to hear about this for the rest of her life  -  \"Remember when I spent my last few pennies on your dress. I had to eat rice for a month afterward and I couldn't afford my medication, but you looked so lovely!\" I don't want to think about how much of a fucking narcissist my mom is every time I look at my wedding photos.\n\nI started doing some preliminary online shopping and found sample dress on sale for $100 down from $500! I ordered it and it's arriving today. Assuming it fits and looks okay, this is the one. \n\nHere's the problem: My mom is coming to visit for the first time in a year and dress shopping is at the top of her list.\n\nI'm so stressed out about what to say. I know I need to tell her that I bought a dress already, but I really just want to lie or avoid this whole situation. Anyone who's dealt with a narcissist knows how she's going to turn this around on me so I'm the asshole, and blow this whole thing out of proportion.  I never really developed a healthy relationship or mechanisms to deal with her and I just avoid situations like these to keep peace. My best idea so far was to tell her I found the dress at Goodwill. What's wrong with me???\n\nI know I need to tell her, but what's the best way to approach this with the least amount of explosion? How do I stand up for myself without being a total dick? I believe in speaking my mind and doing what you want, I just don't want to deal with this fallout.\n\nTL;DR:  I'm still a child at nearly 30 who is scared to tell her mom that she bought a dress.",

            "It took until I was 32 years old to realize I could get my haircut whatever way I wanted.\n\nIt took that long also to realize I didn't need to pick up the phone, that I didn't need to explain my choices, that even if I were to do everything perfectly and be a clone of my father in every way and be subservient to his every whim, that he would still be perpetually, clinically self-centered and *NOTHING* would ever make him happy.\n\nThe thing about narcissists is they train you to constantly think you need to get their validation and approval by giving you a sense of guilt and debt to them, by training you from childhood to never feel like you did *quite* good enough, and that next time if you try just a little harder, that maybe, just maybe they would drop you a kernel of praise or respect as an individual.\n\nThe only way you win their game is to not play. The only way you come out as a winner is to escape. You will never please them, you will never win, you will never get that long, heartfelt talk where they finally understand and respect you and apologize for treating you like a disappointing child your whole life. You have to accept that and understand that if you want to live on your own terms, you have to do the hard thing and start looking at them as a person who gave you genes, not a parent that wants the best for you and actually loves you the same way you might love your own children.\n\nYou don't owe anyone explanations for your own decisions. If you allow this feeling to foster and nurture this narcissistic relationship you will lose people around you, you will not be able to love yourself, you will not be able to love others and build your own life and you will become anxious and less of a person.\n\nI'm a 40-year old man and my life was wrecked by a narcissistic father but I didn't know even a shred of peace until I stopped responding to him and got some therapy and changed my phone number. People who seek to control you won't have less than that. That's the nature of abusers.",
            "Wanting to avoid unnecessary drama (even if you aren't the one being unnecessary) isn't childish, it's just reasonable. But you also can't really avoid it.\n\n\"Oh, we can skip shopping, I found a really amazing deal on a dress so you don't have to worry about it! What do you think about chinese for dinner?\" Repeat ad nauseum. Redirect immediately. Mention that you would feel guilty if your mom put herself out just for a dress, and then ask if she heard about that new netflix show. When she presses, and she will press, brush her off. \"Mom, I already told you I got the dress taken care of, so you really don't have to stress about it. I've been meaning to ask, what's your book club up to?\"\n\nHonestly I don't think this is a situation you can \"win\", just one you can manage. She's a narcissist, there's no outmaneuvering that, so if you're committed to her being involved your best bet is to just be cheerful teflon and act like she's being silly when she tries to pitch a fit about it. She's going to act like you're being unreasonable or mean to her either way, you can't stop that, but you can keep from giving her the attention and drama she's looking for.",
            "Tell her now before she comes. That way if she flips out and starts blowing up your phone you can tell her \"Mom, it seems like this is probably not a good time for you to come visit. Let's postpone your trip for another time.\"\n\nWhatever you do, don't show her the dress, she'll hate it and make unpleasant comments about it and you'll feel badly or start doubting your choice. Just tell her that you found a great dress that you're happy with it. If she asks to see it, tell her that no one is seeing it before the wedding. Leave it at a friend's house while she's visiting so she doesn't snoop.\n\nText her and tell her you found a great dress, but you'd love to go shopping for a mother of the bride dress with her when she visits. If she's wise, she'll be happy with sharing that experience with you. But don't count on it. It's far more likely that she's going to be angry and tell you that she TOLD you she wanted to buy you the dress, etc. \"Sorry you feel that way, mom. I'm the bride and I chose a dress that I'm happy with it.\" is really all you need to say in response.",
            "Ugh God my mom did the exact same thing, except the day I went shopping for my dress with my BFF she just kept calling me crying and completely ruined the whole experience. She spent my adolescence criticizing my clothing and body almost every day, so no I didn't want her there.\n\nI feel like I know that feeling of anxiety when you're about to do something that will set off your narc mother. No matter how much you rationalize it as an adult, she had years to train you to feel guilty. \n\nIf she wants to be supportive of you, your wedding, and your marriage, then she needs to support your choices. You are in the right here. There is literally no reason for you to feel guilty, no matter what she says. \n\nFWIW, therapy helped me immensely with developing strategies for setting boundaries and dealing with my mother. Especially if you're planning on kids, I highly recommend starting to set those boundaries now.",
            "I made the mistake of purchasing my wedding dress that was 75% off, 1 day before my mother arrived to where I was living and getting married at the time.  \nIt was a huge sale. I had gone with my JYMIL and her daughter, and man, I was not expecting to find anything, but I did, and I could not put it on hold. I could've requested to pay the store and keep it there, and pretend I found it the day my mom got here. But then I thought, my time was limited, I could not waste another day pretending to look for a dress, and then most likely my mom doing a show-off and wanting to purchase the dress and give me the same complaint of her monetary \"sacrifices\".\n\nI ended up telling her, and boy was she a twat. How dare I, How could I, I never think of her, how disrespectful, what a terrible daughter I am, the dress is a mother-daughter thing (I don't know since when for us, since in our culture that is pretty whatever) In retrospect, it was all a ruse to show off. My MIL ended up paying for the wedding, and my mom trying to one-up her, stated she was gonna pay for the bar (it was like $300 and tried complaining about it, but everyone reminded her she didn't have to, since it was already covered by MIL)  \nThen she offered to pay for our honeymoon.  \nAnd I took the offer.  \n\n\nAnd she never payed me back.\n\nAnd that is how My husband I got our first credit card debt and my husband never trusted my mother ever again.  \n\n\n  \n**There is nothing wrong with you.** YEARS of conditioning and manipulation from her make you filter every choice, every decision you make through your idea of her judgement of you. Will she agree, will she like this, will she approve, will she complain, will she say something nasty, will she make you feel bad about it. Gosh, is endless.  \n\n\nIf I were you, take this opportunity to set boundaries. Yes, that is super scary, SUPER FREAKING SCARY, but once you've done it, it is so liberating. You can simply tell her the truth. It is the truth. **You cannot let her make you feel bad for telling the truth** (imagine, how fucked up the dynamics of the relationship are with a narc, that they make you feel guilty FOR TELLING THE TRUTH)\n\nYou found a dress. You liked it, you bought it.  \n\\*EXPLOSIONS\\*  \nCalmly move on. Grey rock her:  You found a dress. You liked it, you bought it.  \n\n\nShe will, hopefully, get bored of you not reacting to her overreaction. If not, take this also as a stepping stone to start shaping boundaries to go LC.  \nAs a word of advice for you, I strongly urge to set your boundaries now before this actively affects your marriage. It took the entirety of my marriage to finally see that my mother was a driving wedge between me and my husband, me and my sanity and my husband felt helpless to see me fall for her manipulation.  \nI went NC with my mom last July, and my marriage has been the most solid it has been since I got married. I no longer have that filter in my head of trying to appease her.   \nBest wishes!",
            "You know your mom is an N, so why are you letting her come visit you? Why are you letting her ignore your wishes and plan a giant reception for you? Why are you lying and covering and walking on eggshells?\n\nNothing you do or tell her will make her happy. Because that is who she is. Unless everything is done her way, she will be abusive.\n\nSo it's up to you to stop hiding in the shadows and just live your truth. You are not a dependent scared little girl anymore. You are 29 years old and you are allowed to do what you want with your wedding.\n\nYou tell her that you found a great dress and purchased it. If she rages, you ask her to leave. If she refuses to leave, you call the cops.\n\nDon't put up with this bullshit anymore. Don't live in fear. Live authentically and if she wants to get on board and be a part of your life, she will have to adapt.",

            "My friend has a similar situation she has major anxiety and already her mom and MIL (who hate each other) were complaining to her about the dress shopping. She originally asked us (her friends) to do a trip to a major city to try on in the summer. Moms were furious.\n\nNext thing I know she bought a used dress online and has it ready to be altered. She did it completely alone as the price was right and it's the one she wanted. No stress and it's done.",
            "God, this brought back memories.   My mom insisted on a certain $1000 dress (that she made my dad pay for,  I hated it and it didn't fit me even after alterations.  I couldn't breathe in it.) She did the whole monetary thing too and screamed at me in front of everyone in the bridal shop for saying I wanted to wear a nice pair of flip flops instead of heels.   All she gave a damn about was getting her way,  and looking good in the pictures.   I'm now divorced and the wedding was horrible. \n\nI was too afraid to say anything because of the years of mental anguish.  Do whatever you can to prevent her doing this to you.   Do things the way you want. Bottom line is it's your wedding. Not hers. \n\nI'm getting married again in the fall.   We're eloping and not telling anyone,  especially in my family.   I found a great dress on poshmark for $150.  It's going to be a million times better. \n\nI hope you have a wonderful wedding and marriage together.

            "My mom is a narcissist. I\u2019m also getting married this summer. Dress shopping with her was the worst part of wedding planning so far. She spent the day trying to redirect attention to herself and talking bad about me to my mother in law (who later told me everything), and when that didn\u2019t work she pouted and stormed off (only to return and pout some more when everyone ignored the storm off). \n\nYou. Dodged. A. Bullet. \n\nDress shopping is basically putting yourself in a situation where she\u2019d have both your attention and sales people\u2019s attention in a captive setting. I\u2019m sure you can imagine the disaster that could ensue with that combo and an nmom. Like the others said, put her on an info diet, and don\u2019t over explain. Just tell her you ended up finding the perfect dress unexpectedly so you guys no longer need to go looking for one.

I set boundaries very early and didn't get the brunt of her narcissistic behaviors because I had other siblings who didn't know how to shut her down.

Not to mention I live very far away and don't have to deal with her very often.",
            "It took me nearly 40 years of thinking I had to put my narcissistic mother\u2019s feelings first before I woke up and realized I could just\n\n*let her be upset*\n\nThe world will not end. \n\nYou\u2019re a grown woman, out on your own, doing your thing, living your life ... So what if she gets upset? Don\u2019t let your mother\u2019s emotions rule your actions.",
            "So, my therapist gave me some advice to lean into people's narrative when they are acting this manipulative. Let them win without letting them win. \n\nSo, for your mom this means saying \"Mom, I've really heard how hard money has been for you and how much it weighs on you to spend money on me, and I love you so much I just can't stand the idea of putting you in that position.\" \n\nMeet her drama with drama. If she escalates \"No, I HAVE to do this for you even if I end up homeless because that's how much I love you\" you respond with \"Mom, I would rather be homeless than let you hurt yourself for me! I won't sleep knowing you're doing this for me, you're just such an amazing sacrificial person, and buy me SO many gifts, I just am BESIDE myself with stress about this.\"\n\nMost of the time remaining calm and grey rocking is a good response to people who use emotion to manipulate. But she knows you do that. What you do instead is sap the energy from being dramatic, by being just as dramatic. \n\nFor reference, I did this with someone who owed me money that was saying she was so sick from worrying about paying me that she couldn't work and was considering going to the hospital. I responded with: \n\n\"Can I call you an ambulance? We should absolutely get you to the hospital! If you're so sick for so long, what can I do? Can I go with you to the doctor?\"\n\nI didn't even mention the loan, I leaned into believing her at her word that she was so sick with worry that she was seriously ill. Of course it got her too serious of attention, that would require her to act, and she backed off saying she was fine.",
            "Well, first, go way over the top talking about what a great deal your perfect dress was. And then, \"Now we can focus our shopping trip on *your* dress.\" She can't make *her* dress about you if she picks it out and chooses the price point.",
            "I\u2019d go with confusion\u2014like it never even occurred to you (in spite of what she\u2019s said to you before):\nMom:  but I wanted to buy it for you!\nOP: why would my wedding dress be about what you want?",
            "You've gotten some good advice on how to avoid the situation but you might not be able to. So here's a suggestion if you can't. \n\nBridal shops often deal with pushy mothers. You might be able to find one that will help you out if you call them in advance and explain the situation to them, and then offer to buy accessories from them, or have them do the tailoring. That way they still get a sale from you, and your mom gets to go through the pageantry of seeing you try on a dress. \n\nBut if you can, avoid it. It's really not worth the headache. I went with my narcissist parent dress shopping and they insisted that I try on dresses that didn't fit that weren't the style I liked, that were exactly like their wedding dress. I super hated the whole experience with them, and in the end I eloped on vacation and didn't tell them. I let them think we were still planning on getting married, then I had a 'courthouse wedding' (took a day off work where we relaxed, treated ourselves to lunch, and did some light shopping) and came over for dinner to tell them what happened. They still flipped out but there wasn't anything they could do about it.",
            "Honestly I would just tell her it was a deal you couldn\u2019t pass up and although you appreciate her wanting to pay for the dress, that maybe she can help in another way instead.\n\nI\u2019m having issues too with my wedding and my mother in law. We wanted to elope too but then it turned into a small ceremony to involve her and some of my family and now it\u2019s a shit show of her taking any idea I have and running with it and buying things I don\u2019t 100% want before I have a chance to make up my mind.\n\nSometimes you finally just need to put your foot down and just ask them to stop and be understanding because it\u2019s YOUR day. She had her wedding and this is all up to you, but I\u2019m sure once the day comes you will be happy \ud83d\udc95",
            "Honestly? I can't see any way around this other than to tell her the truth. Try framing it as a positive: \"omg mom I cant wait to show you! I found the perfect dress and I know you're going to love it. Let me pour you a cup of tea and I'll try it on for you.\" Cater to her narcissism if you think it will help by making showing her the dress a special moment.",
            "Can't fix mom. You are an adult now. Look her dead in the eye and tell her you found the dress. Do not put it in the form of a question. When she reacts...and she will...just keep focus on her eyes while nodding your head in the affirmative. Will NOT matter what she says. You will notice she will start nodding up and down with you. It is almost impossible for a narcissist (or anyone else) to argue while saying yes with their head. I know it sounds silly, but it is an old sales technique I learned long ago and it really works. I had the Queen Mother of the Greek God Narcissus for a MIL. Have had lots and lots of practice. Best wishes on your upcoming nuptials!",
            "Based on your distaste for this relationship, have you thought of telling her what you really want to before she travels? \"Mom, I bought a dress online that I fell in love with already, so when you come here we can just have a nice weekend together.\" Then, allow her to bite back (because you know, buying a dress you fall in love with is obviously so wrong). Then you can tell her that reactions such as this and the way you treat me after you buy me things are the very reason I do things like this on my own.\n\nWorst case scenario, she doesn't come visit, right? It seems that wouldn't be so bad based on your mindset.",
            "So, I know what I would do in this situation, because I\u2019m doing something similar but for different reasons. But let it be known that I KNOW it\u2019s not the best way to deal with it. \n\nMy family has a way of making small but rude comments about my size (I\u2019m plus sized) and when I\u2019ve asked them to stop, they act like I\u2019m somehow hurting them by \u201csilencing\u201d them. I don\u2019t want to deal with that in the dress of my dreams, so I took them on a fake shopping trip where I tried on dresses I never intended to buy so they could be a part of the \u201cexperience.\u201d \n\nMy best friends (bridesmaids) and I will shop afterwards until I find the right dress, and this way, my mom can\u2019t be mad that \u201cI didn\u2019t include her.\u201d\n\nI realise that this isn\u2019t the healthiest response, but sometimes you have to pick your battles and keep things zen for your sanity (especially during the stress of wedding planning.) If I were you, I\u2019d honestly just hide the dress you bought somewhere, go try some dresses on with mom, leave empty handed, then let her know \u201cyou finally found a dress!\u201d another day. \n\nGood luck, OP!",
            "I'm going to be straight with you OP. This will prob get downvoted bc people in this sub just like to hear/tell others what they want to hear, but it sounds like you need a wake up call so here goes.\n\nYou let your mom believe that you guys would be going dress shopping together. You also have not clearly declined her offer to buy your dress. So if that's true, quite simply: you are in the wrong in this situation. You are an adult and it's your responsibility to be honest with her about what you do and don't want her to pay for. If she reacts poorly, then it's on her. \n\nSame goes for you \"letting her\" make wedding plans for you \"without acknowledging them\". What's your plan here exactly? To let her plan a wedding dinner for you and then just not show up? That would be cruel beyond anything you have accused her of.\n\nYou say you \"really just want to lie or avoid this whole situation\" and you believe in \"doing what you want\" and \"don't want to deal with the fallout.\" Well being an adult means taking ownership of your choices, setting clear boundaries, and being honest with others - even when it's not easy. It also means dealing with the consequences of your choices, like hurting people's feelings or letting others down, which we all have to do sometimes. Your preemptive worry about your mom's hypothetical reaction does not give you the right to mislead and lie to her.\n\nYour mom's guilting behavior towards you as a child reflects poorly on her character. I'd say the same for how you have handled this situation thus far. Time to grow up and face her like an adult, if you wish to be treated like one.",
            "Nope. You have a shitty, narcissistic, explosive parent. It will explode. What you can do is silo away the explosion from yourself. If I were you, I'd tell her *now* so she can go be shitty and get her harrumphs out away from you. Telling her when she's physically there not only lets her take all her surprise out on you, but it means you have to put up with any sulking or bullshit like that. So I'd tell her now. Maybe something like this:\n\n\"Mom, when we started wedding planning, you said the dress was yours. I hope you can understand that the dress is not yours and never was. I bought a dress I am really happy with and will not be buying a different one. If you would like to go to bridal boutiques too have the fun experience of trying things on, I am open to that\" \\[sidebar: ARE you open to that? or will that just prolong your misery?\\] \"but I will not be buying a dress as I already have the dress I want.\"\n\nThen you say \"I've got to go, love you, bye,\" the second she starts being shitty about it and hang up. Don't wait for her to finish talking. Talk over her. Do not take any calls or texts that day; mute her. Let her explode somewhere else. Don't let her tell you you're the asshole for doing what you want on your own wedding that you are paying for. You're not. Are you familiar with JADE? Don't JADE: Justify, Argue, Defend, or Explain. You are a brick wall. \"Why did you get a dress without me?!\" Because it was what I wanted. \"You promised you'd let me buy it for you & shop with you!\" That wasn't what I wanted. \"Why didn't you want that for me?\" Because it wasn't what I wanted. \"That doesn't make any sense!\" I'm sorry you feel that way. \"You must hate me, you're pushing me out of everything!\" I'm sorry you feel that way. \"How could you do this to me!\" I'm sorry you feel that way. \"You're so unfeeling and thoughtless!\" I'm sorry you feel that way. See? You can deflect like people below are saying, but if she insists on ranting and raving, be a brick wall. Repeat the same nothing line over and over until she quits.\n\nRemember, you have nothing to apologize for. You are not responsible for her feelings or her explosion. Just be neutral. Sing a song in your head while she's ranting and raving, the \"this isn't my problem\" song. Stop righting the boat for her just because she likes rocking it.",
            "Well, assuming the dress fits and you're gonna go with it, I'd send her a text or something - \"Hey so I found this sample dress online a few weeks ago for only $100!! It was a total fluke I was just online looking for ideas but I came across it and couldn't pass it up. The dress just came and it fits perfectly so I'm gonna wear that one :-) I can't wait to try it on for you when you visit next week (or whenever she's coming). Since we won't need to go dress shopping for my dress when you're here, would you like to go shopping for your dress instead?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, there's a really good chance that won't actually really work. That she will get mad, throw a fit, etc. Normal narc stuff. But I think you know what you have to do then. Just repeat \"I already have my dress, I'm not shopping for another.\" \"I'm not trying on other dresses, I love my dress and its the one for me.\" \"We can go shopping for your dress if you want.\" No arguments, no defending yourself, no justifying your choice. How she chooses to react is her choice, you cannot control that, and trying will only end up with you hurt. You cannot avoid the fallout - but lying and avoiding at this point will add more stress down the road.",
            "Just tell her the truth. You already bought the dress you want. If she throws a fit tell her you can see shes too emotional and will call back/visit at a time when shes not so emotional.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts your wedding, not your moms. You need to learn to set boundaries and stand up to her. This wont get better, and will be exponentially worse if/when you have children.",
            "\"Oh, I already bought my dress, I found a great bargain and its perfect! Maybe we can go (do some other planning activity) together?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, it sounds like your mom and my mom are very similar. From experience, there is a minimum level of drama you won't be able to avoid. For your own sanity, when you want to set a boundary related to wedding planning, set it it in stone and don't look back or budge. There will be a storm but it will blow over. If she tries to make you feel bad, hang up or change the subject after firmly but politely letting her know your decision is final and you wont' change your mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will tell you this because I needed to hear it almost daily when I was planning my wedding: Being able to make choices about your wedding doesn't make you an asshole. You are allowed to set boundaries without feeling guilty. If your mom can't handle hearing a polite \"no,\" that is her problem, not yours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: reading responses and seeing others have given almost identical responses, but leaving mine up because it bears repeating.",

Tell her you appreciate  the gesture but that you two can have a mother and daughter day. Make it seem more special than a wedding dress shopping day. You guys can paint your nails, do face mask, order some pizza and eat ice cream, ask her so many questions and ask for \"advice\" even if you don't need it. It could make her forget what was the whole reason she would visit was dress shopping. I think bonding time would mean so much.",
            "Wow, YOUR mother is MY mother. I would totally say you just happened to see it on sale and were afraid that it would be gone if you came back. Tell her BEFORE her visit. Tell her ASAFP. \"Mom, I just now this moment paid a great price for an amazing dress they just happened to have on clearance in my size. I had to get it. I know you wanted to get that, but maybe you can help me pick out shoes.\" \n\nAnyway, about the other stuff? You do your wedding your way or you're going to be irritated for the rest of forever for caving to her unreasonable whims. That has been my experience. I wanted to go to the courthouse - just me and my fiance/husband - and then have a big reception, but my mom just could not deal with that and she cried. So we had a tiny church wedding (still got that reception, tho!) which ended up irritating a lot of other people (we had to draw the line somewhere, so we went with immediate family, which apparently ultimately meant my stepbrothers that I hardly know, and excluded other people much closer to me). Anyway, DO IT YOUR WAY. Especially if you are financially independent. You don't have to play this game.",

If you buy me a dress or try to guilt trip me about it, you will be disinvited from the wedding.\"\n\nIf you keep avoiding issues and refusing to put your foot down, this is going to continue the rest of your life. If you decide to have kids, she'll be crying about spending her last pennies on things for them. Send back unsolicited gifts.

You need to tell her all these things very bluntly oh, that you do not plan on having a big cake renting a hall or any of those traditional things and that you have already gotten your dress.

It's a great, supportive group and has helped me deal with people in my life just by reading the stories and advice there.  Good luck and congrats on getting hitched. :)",
            "I'm so sorry you're dealing with something like this at a time that should be super happy and exciting for you and your SO. I have a similar relationship with my mother where she would dangle anything she ever did/paid for for me over my head, even if I didn't ask for it or insist on it or would have been fine with something less expensive. For the longest time I thought I would just never get married (or possibly elope, if I did choose to marry) to avoid the insane amount of stress that would come with having a wedding while dealing with her. Now I'm a grownup with a partner I'd like to marry, and I'm realizing that I actually would like to have a wedding and, y'know, invite people to it. She's going to bulldoze her way into being involved/in control/the center of attention unless I have fucking IRONCLAD boundaries so I'm working on that now. I also don't want her to come dress shopping or anything like that with me since she's been massively critical of my body my entire life, and I actually stopped going shopping with her altogether a few years ago when I realized my life would be much better if I never had to hear \"those pants would look good on you if you just lost ten more pounds\" from her ever, ever again. \n\nFor your situation, you need to do the same thing--learn to draw and then hold your boundaries. State things as **facts**, which she can't argue with: \n\n\"Hey mom, I found the perfect dress and just had to buy it!\" \n\nCheery, firm, and already done. If you want to throw her a bone and give her a little bit of the \"trying on dresses in a boutique\" experience maybe you can try it on in your living room while the two of you drink champagne or something. You absolutely DO NOT have to do this if it'll just be another avenue for her to bully you about your dress choice/your body/whatever. This is YOUR wedding dress, it's FOR YOU, and you should feel happy about wearing it and not have it tinged with memories of your mom being shitty to you about it. \n\nI honestly would also put your foot down and put a stop to her planning an extravagant dinner if that's not what you want--couch everything as a joint decision (\"actually, fianc\u00e9 and I want to get pizza and go bowling after our ceremony!\" or whatever) and again be cheery but firm. \n\nIf she argues with you about any of this stuff? Tell her \"thanks for your input, but I'm doing x.\" And then change the subject. Another good canned phrase is \"ok, I'll think about that.\" You will think about it and your decision will most likely be \"nope, no way in hell,\" but she doesn't need to know that in the moment and it allows you to change the subject and move on. If she argues with you about any of this, end the conversation--put down the phone, leave the room, stop answer texts. \n\nThere is no winning by arguing with people like this--they win by drawing you into the argument and making you feel upset. Narc parents also install all kinds of guilt trip buttons in us and get off on withholding approval and affection, so you trying to jump to make her happy is basically a pointless exercise--no matter how high you jump, no matter what shape you contort yourself into, she's never going to be happy or satisfied with you. There is also no situation in which your mom is not going to find a reason to be upset with you, so you need to just accept that she's going to react however she reacts, and you just need to make yourself happy.  \n\nI would check out Captain Awkward column #583--I think the advice applies to your situation nicely even if the situation the letter writer is in is a bit different. The underlying issue is the mom's narcissistic behavior and the adult daughter's terror of disappointing/upsetting her (when the mom is going to find a reason to be upset no matter what the daughter does, because that's who she is). There's a ton of great resources at that site as well about dealing with narcissistic parents and setting boundaries. \n\nFinally, if you haven't gotten any therapy to deal with this stuff, I would strongly suggest doing that. It is IMMENSELY helpful in learning how to draw boundaries. Unfortunately the kinds of issues you get from growing up with a parent like this never just go away quietly, they keep coming up, whether if it's with your parents or if it's in your interactions with other people. \n\nAnyway, good luck and sorry again that you're dealing with this. All the best to you and your SO as you start your married life together.",
            "You do need to tell her asap before she arrives but You don't need to justify yourself. The most important thing a child of a Narcissist must learn is how to calmly claim your boundaries. Where you got the dress, what you paid for it etc is your choice and not a crime. Tell her you need her for shoes , or earrings, hair, make up etc...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't fear her givin you hell about this for the rest of your life. Narcissists are insane and never stop, asking her to be loving and supportive is like asking a blind person to read the subtitles in a movie. She will be digging at you about something as long as you are in contact with her. You can only control yourself and how much of this drama you allow into your life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA critical part of getting married is starting a new family with your love.

            "I recommend just biting the bullet and telling her before she comes, that was she has time to prepare.  Don't defend or explain.

Also you can just go and try some dresses for fun with her and go choose the perfect \"mother of the bride\" dress with her. Maybe it was more about the experience of choosing it with you than the dress itself. Also, tell her that you hadn't show anyone else the dress and try it on with her, make it \"special\" a mother/daughter thing.

            "I\u2019d say go shopping with her, give the experience but avoid any dresses you think you\u2019re actually going to love (because it\u2019d suck to accidentally fall in love with a dress when you already bought one). Stay impartial and just let your mother enjoy her time but make sure you don\u2019t give her an opportunity to spend money. Then say maybe next time you\u2019ll find a dress. \n\nThen after a couple weeks tell her how you couldn\u2019t believe you found the perfect dress on sale! It was too amazing to pass up and given it\u2019s a sample dress you didn\u2019t have the time to wait for your mother so you bought it yourself. eliminates the problem of leaving your mother out and gives an explanation as to you getting the dress in a way that suits the narcissistic nature of your mother. \n\nIf she starts getting upset over not getting to buy it tell her how much it meant to you to be able to spend time with her dress shopping and how it was that experience that helped you pick the perfect dress (again slightly feeding the narcissism without causing a huge fuss).

            "I just wanted to tell you to keep the dress away from her!!! Store it at a friends, take it to get cleaned or tailored, leave it at your office. Something!! Do not let her have some crazy cockamamie accident of dropping her glass of cranberry juice down the front of the dress because she got lost and wound up in the closet with the dress.",

            "I would leave it until you've tried your dress on and are sure its THE ONE (just in case you actually do need to go shopping)... then when she arrives just say \"hey mom I'm so excited! I found a great dress on sale and I'd love your opinion on it.  I just need to choose some matching jewellery/shoes if you wouldn't mind helping me with that...\"\n\nShe (hopefully) won't want to dampen your excitement and this still lets her feel involved and that her opinion is important. Don't justify or apologise.  If she still loses it just tell her you're disappointed that she doesn't share your excitement and you'll be fine with getting the other stuff yourself and leave it at that. You don't owe her anything...",
            "Honestly, I know most people would say to stay firm and just tell it like it is.  But if it were me, I'd just lie and say that a really good friend gave you her wedding dress as a gift since she no longer had use for it.  AND since your mom is already tight on funds, you accepted and are SO IN LOVE with the dress.\n\nThat way you didn't go shopping without her and it was \"free.\"",
            "My best friend did this. She went out and tried on dresses without her Nmom because it was more\nenjoyable with friends, she found her dress and bought it. We then had another day where she tried on more dresses (but pretended she didn\u2019t find one she liked). During that trip we also helped her mom find mother of the bride dress. We kept our secret and she was satisfied because part of the day was about her.  My friend then told her mom a month later that she had found one on the internet.",

            "You probably don't need more input at this stage, but I can somewhat relate. Your mom might be looking forward to spending the time with you and watch you try on dresses. Maybe you can tell her you've bought one already but are open to trying some others on for fun in case you find one you like better (which you won't).",
            "Go dress shopping, enjoy the experience...trying on pretty dresses, drinking champagne, etc. But, there\u2019s no need to buy anything during this shopping outing. You can show her the dress you want to wear after all of the hooplah of shopping and enjoying that experience- I will say it\u2019s a very fun one, even more so if you\u2019re not feeling pressured to buy then and there. You can even break it down to your mom that you wanted to have the experience with her, but you had seen this one before your shopping together and really feel it\u2019s the one. Make it more about sharing the experience with her (this makes it all about her, which will keep her calm) and that the dress you want is \u201cthe one.\u201d",

Unsurprisingly, I cut him off and have nothing to do with him. I'll have to pay for my mother to be at my wedding, so she gets ZERO say in anything. Also because I have to fund her presence at my wedding, she can either pay for her own outfit if she wants a new one for my wedding, or she can damn well wear any of the millions of fabulous clothes she already owns, because she really doesn't need any more.

            "I am 40 years old and I have dealt with a narcissistic parent as well. I just literally discovered that she is narcissistic after finding the lovely subreddit RaisedbyNarcissists. You should check it out, its a big support group over there. I feel comfortable and can speak about what I want, even if it is just to rant and rave. \n\nWhen you said that your Mom would hold it over your head about spending her last pennies on your dress, I felt like it was coming from my Mom's mouth. The thing about her always having holes in her clothes and being poor, see my Mom pulled that line of shit with me until I found out later it was all a lie. Mom was never poor when she grew up, of course they weren't rolling in the dough but still they had clothes to wear for school and plenty of food to eat.\n\nThe easiest way that I have found to deal with a narcissistic parent is to avoid them like the plague. I had to, but my situation is a bit different. It sounds like from what you have told in this story that your Mom could be really toxic if allowed to be. My mother has blamed me for everything in my life even the things that SHE did wrong, I got the blame for them. She is going to make you feel like nothing you ever do is good enough and somehow wrap it around to make YOU feel sorry for HER about it. \n\nI think the best thing you can do is stand your ground and just tell her, \"This is what I picked out, if you don't like it fine but it is not YOUR day. This is MY day. Again, if you don't like it, then go home. It is as simple as that.\" If you don't feel comfortable with telling her, I am sure that your fellar is not going to want someone toxic there and causing a big stink on what is supposed to be your day. When I say your, I mean you and your fiance. \n\nIf she is anything like my Mom, it doesn't matter what you say you will always be the bad person and she will get mad at everything anyways. Might as well take this chance to stand up to her and if she gets mad, it was going to happen about something else anyways. \n\nMy mother in law, (rest in peace Teresa) HATED my Mom. She absolutely couldn't stand her, because she seen through her pity trips and manipulation. The second that my Mom would leave my mother in law's apartment, she would say \"I just want to smack the shit out of your Mom, sorry but I can't help it.\" She would have too if I had said, \"Sure go right ahead Teresa.\" I think sometimes I should have let her knock some sense into my Mom. \n\nI will say this finally, you can do this however you choose but just know this, it is your day. Don't stress yourself out over something like this if you can help it. Do some research on narcissistic parents , it helped me get a better hold on some of Mom's reactions to things. Join us in RBN, love to have you over there and it does help to share things and get them off your chest. I would stand up to her, (well I would now that I am stronger, but I didn't used to be like that) and just tell her but I understand if you don't want to upset anyone. I haven't spoken to my Mom and have had no relationship with her since 2013, honestly there are times I miss her of course but life has been better because of it. Narcissistic parents, its all about them. I got tired of walking on eggshells around Mom and deleted myself from her life. She doesn't care anyways, she loves her ex-stepdaughter more anyways let those 2 be crazy together. I hope this works out for you. Sorry it was so long winded.",
            "Just straight up tell her that YOU got the dress so SHE wouldn't try and hold it over you because (as you've stated in your post) she has done it many times over the years and it's not something you want to be reminded of every time you two get in contact. But that's justly opinion OP so",
            "Yeah, you should tell her that you already have a dress and she doesn't necessarily need to \"spring\" to get you one. I like the suggestions people have been making to put your foot down and just deflect. \"Yes, I already got myself one, thank you. How was your trip? Did you find your way here alright? Would you like some pudding?\" I always find offering food to be a nice was of getting someone to \"shut their trap\" and enjoy themselves near me \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",
            "Ask her what store and ask that store if they can do a favor for you and ask them to put your dress up on the day your mom is coming and then tell your mom that the dress looks pretty and try and convince her that is the one and have the dress be on sale for like 150-225.",
            "I think the point is to realise that if you've done no wrong and owe her nothing and behave as such. And also don't put up with her crap.  Since she's apparently remote from you, this is easier as you always have the option of not speaking to her.\n\nThe second thing I would do is punish the bad behaviour.  The thing about parents, is that it can be hard for them to let go an realise that they don't control you, but they often do want you around and to have contact with you.  So assuming you're in that boat, this gives you a good weapon.  If they behave badly, then you punish them by taking yourself away.  They need to learn that not only is their behaviour not ok, but that there is a consequence to it.  And leave them with a choice of either treat you with respect or lose you.\n\nFor example:   If she's behaving badly state your boundary \"It's my wedding, so it's my choice.  I'm not going to discuss it further. \"  If she carries on, then just say  \"I'm going now.  Talk to you later.\" and hang up.\n\nThe thing with this approach, is in my view there's no down side.  If they learn the lesson, then they will treat you with respect.  If they don't, then eventually you cut them off completely and you lose the negative influence in your life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of specific approaches to your situation, this is what I would do:\n\nI'd start by sending her a photo of you wearing the dress with \"Mum! Look what I got!\".  Because that's the normal thing to do, and the normal thing for her to do is respond about how lovely you look in it.\n\nIf, on the off chance, you get a positive response, then it was fear over nothing.\n\nBut more likely she's going to call you or message you back to have a go at you.  State your boundary, that it's your wedding and your choice of dress, not hers. If she doesn't respect that, just say that you're not going to participate in this conversation and that she can get back in touch once she has calmed down, then hang up/stop responding etc.\n\nAssuming your dad is in the picture (you didn't say), you could also explain to him that you're not putting up with her crap and that you don't want her to do her manipulation on your special day.  Even explain that if you have to, then you'll un-invite her from the wedding.  If he isn't supportive of that, you can say that it's your wedding and your choice of dress, and it's reasonable to expect guests to behave in a civil way when they attend, and it's also reasonable for you to not invite guests who you believe will not be civil at the wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven if you don't follow the advice. Remember that you are in the right, and you do have power.  You have the choice whether to gift your time and attention to your parents, and you have the choice to take that away if they don't deserve it.  They have no rights over you. You have no responsibilities to them except that which you choose to take.",
            "You could go look at some dresses with your mum \n\nMaybe try on a few to humour her along with trying on a dress that is similar to the one you bought (or atleast have different elements of your dress) and ask her to take pictures so you can \"decide later\"\n\nThen a few days after you tell her that you found a perfect dress that you love with 'description on dress and what you love about it here' for a bit less than the ones in store (don't give actual price) then just thank her for everything she's done and that she's your inspiration (basically whatever will make her tear up)",
            "Best thing to do is just be blunt and use her own words and logic against her",
            "is there an update? did the dress fit?",
            "When I was 16 I cut my mom out of my life. I tried to bring her back in when I was 20 and pregnant with my son. Big mistake. I had to cut her out again. Like completely. Last year I was diagnosed with cancer and I told her to make my other siblings away because it\u2019s a genetic mutation and I\u2019m not sure if I got it from her side or my dads side but yeah. She still calls me once a week from out of country begging me to come visit because she thinks she\u2019s dying. I\u2019m so far removed from the situation I\u2019m going to literally party when that happens. She left me on my grandparents doorstep when I was 3 and it took me until I was 16 to understand she never wanted me or my siblings just the attention. Sometimes you have to make these hard decisions to cut family out. And if not now then you will just be miserable your entire life trying to please her. That\u2019s how it was for me until I was 16. I used to self harm because of the way she treated me and used me for attention.",
            "Hey OP! How did it go with your mom?",
            "One of the ways I've learnt to deal with my mom is appealing to her emotions and ego at the same time. I don't always explain myself to her but I have found that using the words, I feel ? when you ?, can be a helpful wake up call for the N.  Your story doesn't have to be the whole truth either but some relevancy helps with your case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if this sounds right, possibly tell her that you're SCARED (use the feeling words) that she is going to spend all her money on the dress, and then REGRET it much later. You know how many SACRIFICES she has made for you, which MUST have been/you know were HARD/TOUGH on her and those were PLENTY. \n\nYou are so GRATEFUL for that / her and are HAPPY that she'll be there for you on your wedding day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNegative (downer) followed by positive (upper) (feedback strategy and style).\n\nYou are a little NERVOUS AND WORRIED to talk about this because you know it MEANS SO MUCH TO HER but you didn't realise about the dress and your timing (preliminary) re the communication was UNFORTUNATELY off, so you actually found this LOVELY/CUTE/PERFECT dress YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH at ?/Goodwill/online/f you don't want her to see the dress: you promised a friend and she's busy making it and you don't want to LET HER DOWN.etc..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a EXCITING and HAPPY day for you and you are LOOKING FORWARD to it and you would REALLY APPRECIATE it if she could possibly give you something a little more PERSONAL or consider HELPING with something, especially because you are trying to keep it low key and you know that the money is a SACRIFICE for her. OR You saw this GREAT pair of shoes / an accessory that goes PERFECTLY with the dress. Maybe she could help?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*I know that this approach sounds kinda manipulative but you often have to adjust your angle and use the Powers of Persuasion because of the nature of the situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAppealing to emotions can disarm people and help them to chill. Because emotions are honest and with this, if she is so inclined, you won't have to continue explaining yourself or face 1000 questions.",

Flowers, a hat, veil, a \"good\" camera for wedding photos,  cake knife etc.   \"OMG Mom i don't have ABC yet and I don't know about this stuff, I need your help\" There are a lot of things that probably don't matter to you that she would love to take over.

As long as someone is being a jerk, they deserve to be treated like one. You blame me for not having your medicine? How about I blame you for not having bought me enough? You want to rule over my wedding? Cool - you're not invited anymore. Etc. Yes, it will cause a lot of drama, but the following times she'll think a little more, knowing that it won't be as pleasant to blame you. Repeat until not needed anymore. While yes, it'll be more pleasant to avoid the conflict, doing this will need you to do this every single time, while turnig her blows toward herself will have a lasting effect.",

However in my teenage years I had a 'glowup' and developed more and more social skills and nowadays I have no social anxiety anymore and find it generally easy to meet and talk to new people. I feel like I am generally liked and I don't feel excluded.\n\nHowever, there is a thing I've noticed which is that friendships don't seem to stick around a lot of the time. By that I mean, people that I've met and then don't see them that often anymore for some reason, don't seem interested in staying in contact. For example old coworkers. In my first job people hung out in private a lot and we all got along awesomely. However after I left, noone tried to stay in contact with me. I tried to keep it up somewhat but it fizzled out eventually. I know however that some people from that job are still friends to this day and meet, whereas I have not seen or heard from anyone from there in years. \n\nAnd that is just one example, but that seems to be how it goes usually. I have one friend who has been around for 7 years which is great, but apart from that, I have a hard time finding people who really want to stick around, if you know what I mean? It's like when I'm part of a friend group I seem liked and don't feel like they value me less than the others, but then when someone would have to make an effort to keep me in their lives they just don't. And I compare it to what I see from other people. For example I was pretty tight with a few people in high school, so about 8 years ago. I know that they or at least some of them are still close friends, while I have not heard anything from any of them since.. well 8 years.\n\nAny advice? Am I just unlucky or is it something about me?\n\n___\n\n\n**tl,dr:** It seems like even people who like me don't try hard to stay in my life, and I don't have many lasting friendships.

            "Honestly sounds pretty normal based on your one example. For instance, I\u2019m very friendly and outgoing at work and have a lot of work friends. Occasionally we\u2019ll hang out together outside of work, but generally these people are all work friends, not friend-friends. I\u2019ve been working professionally for five years now and I\u2019ve only become true friends with one person from work. Around coworkers, no matter how close you are at work, there\u2019s [generally] always a layer of professionalism that\u2019s there preventing me from truly being my realest self the way I am around my actual friends.\n\nRemember friendships are a two way street. You have to put in effort to maintain that relationship, but just as much, that person has to as well. But not everyone is willing to do that, especially as we get older.\n\nKeep being yourself and hopefully you\u2019ll find more real, genuine friends.",
            "This is pretty normal. I've noticed that people tend to all be friends \"as a group\" but can't seem to hang out with each other 1:1. In other words, if the group isn't hanging out as a whole then people aren't going to just hang out with each other. This tells me that people aren't REALLY friends with each other and might not feel compelled to hang out if someone leaves the group since they don't feel like they're very close in the individual sense.",
            "Be more assertive and reach out to your old friends on a 1 on 1 basis and try to spend time with them catching up.   1 on 1 friendships last longer than group friendships because people can talk about a wider range of subjects.  Also, try to make friends at work...again on a 1 on 1 basis.  \n\nOk, so i'm biased and I prefer 1 on 1 friendships but you should seriously consider having multiple 1 on 1 friendships and maybe have a group of casual friends as well that you hang out on the side that you can meet by joining casual sports leagues such as for volleyball and such.",
            "I can definitely relate! I don\u2019t have many close friends and I don\u2019t click with people too easily. As I get older, I\u2019m realizing how hard it is to keep a friendship going, especially when my friends are getting married or entering different life stages.\n\nI\u2019ve had to do most of the initiating with some of my friends, and I\u2019ve found that when I don\u2019t initiate, they never do - which is when the friendship dies. So now I\u2019m just learning to focus my attention on myself and the friends who do reach out reciprocally. I don\u2019t want to waste my efforts on people who don\u2019t care about me.  Focus on you and what makes you happy. When you find something you\u2019re passionate about, you\u2019re likely to find others who feel the same - thus creating more bonding opportunities. \n\nIt\u2019s not an easy thought process to change because I do get stuck in my head.

There really wasn't one huge reason why that happened, but it was a lot of small, cascading factors. \n\n1) Some people put off a vibe that they're not \"available\" to be a friend. How much do you reach out to them vs them reaching out to you? In the case of this friend I mentioned, she never reached out, and it made us feel like we were doing all the work. Also, she would also mention other people/places/activities that we had no context for, and the whole thing sent a message that she had \"moved on\" with her life. Maybe something like this is happening for you? \n\n2) How deep were these relationships? You mention that it was hard to make friends growing up, but it's easier to talk to people now. In my experience, there's a big difference between just knowing how to have a conversation vs. sharing deeply and having a close connection with people. Maybe you're sharing in a way that keeps people at a distance, or people perceive you as being \"shut off\" in some way. \n\n3) Could just be plain ol' bad luck, or not having met your people yet. It happens. The important thing is to keep trying. \n\nTherapy can help with a lot of these things, if you're into that.",
            "I have been in (and with some people, still am in) this situation, so I really empathize with you. If you also live in a large city similar to me, the sheer number of people and busyness of everyone's schedules makes it even harder to maintain close friendships with others.\n\nThese are some things that I've found helpful for me which you may find applicable for your situation:\n\n* Being firm and consistent with planning. People frequently go, \"oh we should meet up for coffee / lunch / dinner!\" but there's almost never any firm plans set about where and when. I often will be the person to say, \"Great! How's \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ day night / afternoon around \\_\\_\\_ pm?\" Obviously the current situation with COVID-19 makes meeting up in person difficult, but even with asking people for a day and time for a call, video chat, etc. will set firm plans down. I often send calendar invites (through Google calendar) to my friends to make sure we're both accountable.\n* Having a similar interest or hobby makes it a lot easier to bond with someone, and to make shared plans around the same thing. \n* Checking in on people regularly and remembering things they've told you about upcoming events or decisions in their lives. It shows people that you really listened to them previously and care enough to follow up on it.\n* Balancing conversations. I've met (and tried to be with) people before who spend most of our conversations talking about themselves, their achievements, etc. and it was pretty offsetting. You should definitely share things about your life and opinions, but making sure to ask your friend about their experiences and thoughts is important too.\n\ntl;dr Maintaining friendships especially as you get older is HARD.",
            "It's very common. A lot of friendships are of convenience or proximity, like work and school friends. \n\nIt takes a lot of effort from both parties to make it work. \n\nI'm hardly acquaintances with my college roommates that I live with for 3 years. \n\nPeople prioritize and/or get busy with work, relationships, existing friendships, family, etc.",
            "Your post seems really passive, not in a bad way I mean. But what I mean is that relationships require work. Do you put the effort needed for the relationships to bloom? Keep in mind that you're entering an age where nothing in society helps in forming friendships passively and they become work, that's why we tend to lose friends when we get older unless circumstances favour maintaining the relationships (like living in a small town).\n\nKeep in mind that other people already do have friendships, so developing an extra friendship takes time and attention. I'm sure you're a wonderful friend but, to put things in perspective, why should they devote time to you instead of their already stablished relationships that they like? Some people don't want to hang with you, not because they don't like you, but because their plate is way too full.\n\nI know that I've explained myself poorly but here it's past midnight. I just wanted to put adult relationships in perspective for you. I hope my comment is helpful.",
            "Wow, are you me!? \n\nI'm 28F and i swear it's like you read me my own life. I grew up with a single mom and we moved all the time so i rarely had friends and was always at home in my bedroom reading or doing some crafty thing to pass the time. My mom had my brother when i was 11 so i spent my pre/teen years babysitting and not being able to socialize much until i got a boyfriend at 15 and started spending my weekends with him to get out more. Mom kicked me out at 19. \n\nLiving on my own and figuring out and maintaining friendships has easily been the most daunting trials of my life so far. I have 2 best friends who are more like family and i try to see them as often as i can but generally it's a few visits a month if that, and we dont talk all the time.\n\nJust the other day i had a good cry about how utterly lonely and disconnected i feel. This quarantine just exacerbates all those feelings like a slap in the face and i can't distract myself from it cause i'm living it. I really do understand how shitty it feels, you're not alone <3 \n\nIf you ever wanna chat send me a message!",
            "It's not you. It's common. \n\nMy theory is that people are afraid of investing their time and emotion on someone, only for terrible things to happen. Who hasn't been betrayed by a friend? Who hasn't felt that sensation of being gutted from the core?",
            "This isn\u2019t all that uncommon as you get older.  Not saying it\u2019s everybody\u2019s normal.",
            "This has been my struggle for most of my late 20\u2019s. I am 29 now and have started to accept that friendships will come and go. I\u2019m still struggling with it! But as life changes, people do too and I\u2019m focusing on making myself happy. \n\nI was a very shy and awkward kid growing up, even in high school. Pretty sure I had social anxiety, was sometimes labeled as the weird kid. But when I went to college, I started coming out of my shell, met some really great people and had a blast! I have some really great memories and old friends from those times. As I graduated and time went on, I kept losing touch with everyone. It seemed impossible to keep in touch or it felt like they didn\u2019t want to keep in touch as much as we used to. \n\nIt used to bother my so much, Id be so upset that even close, good friends, seemed to have move on without me. They got great new jobs, moved in with other friends, moved to new cities far away. Then I got married and it changed the whole friendship dynamic. A lot of my friends are single and like to go out and have fun at bars every weekend, meeting new people. While my life went a different direction, I\u2019m settling down now, looking forward to nights in and trying out new hobbies, or hanging out with my husband. \n\nWhile I look at how far apart socially I am to my old, closest friends, I realize this is a part of life. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad, just different. It\u2019s ok to lose touch with people, or it\u2019s ok to be by yourself and figure out what you want in life and how to grow. \n\nEven now, new friends I meet, they don\u2019t always stick around long. Some become good friends, but most come in and out quickly. And I\u2019m ok with that now. I\u2019m also learning more about who I am and who I want to be around. When I was younger, I was open to being friends with anyone. I wanted to have a big group to go out and party with. Now, I\u2019m more choosy with who I want to spend my time with, I want quality over quantity friendships. \n\nI still go through phases of feeling left out, like no one notices me in a friend group or cares I\u2019m there. I have to just keep reminding myself, I\u2019m happy being myself. If they don\u2019t make the effort, we\u2019re not meant to be close friends. I\u2019m not going to waste my emotional energy on people who don\u2019t think about me too. \n\nNot sure if this how anyone else feels about their 20s but I know quite a few friends have also said this as well. I know it seems really hard when friends come and go so quickly, but just wanted to let you know other people feel this way too! As time goes on, you\u2019ll definitely feel a little better about it-just keep being yourself and make yourself happy! The right people will stay and if they\u2019re meant to stay in your life they will! If they don\u2019t see what a great person you are, then maybe they\u2019re not meant to be in your life-you deserve great friends who notice you and want to be your friend. Hope this kind of helped-you\u2019re not alone!",
            "There are friends for a season, friends for a reason and friends for a lifetime. Most work/school relationships are the \"season\" or \"reason\" variety - you are together hours everyday so relationships take little effort to maintain. It's easy to be friends in those circumstances! Often once you leave those circumstances, relationships naturally lose their closeness. It's nothing negative against you - it's totally normal. It happens to everyone. Nurture your friendship with your friend of 7 years - that sounds like a lifetime friend.",
            "So what efforts are you putting in to maintain and grow friendships? If there are people you want to have relationships with, you need to actually put in the effort to have those relationships. Just like you're sitting around wondering why they never contacted you, probably some of them are sitting around wondering why you never contact them. Someone needs to reach out, or no one will. Might as well be you.",

            "1-2 good friends is about all anyone can expect to have. Co-workers, neighbors etc. come and go. Invest in the 1-2, and enjoy the company of the rest.",
            "Never expect co-workers to be more than just friends while we're working together.  the truth is that for as much as you get along and hang out for work lunches and talk about things at work if you ever leave that company most of the people will probably just quit talking to you cold turkey.\n\nand then as for friends outside of work a lot of times it's about personality and the kind of people you hang around with.\n\nI kind of hanging out with people similar to me which means none of us exactly reach out socialize more than the average person and in fact we might even be okay most of the time without personal interaction with other people.\nand then of course the same kind of people in personalities may be married so then they get all the interaction they need from their spouses without actually needing to do much with me or other people outside of their marriage.\nand then let's say I meet somebody who has a lot of social excitement but overall maybe their excitement is too much for me or I'm not that excited for them so even if we get along just fine but we can probably tell that we're not going to be running in each other's social circles very much every weekend or every other weekend as an example.\n\nSo all this is to say that even though you don't actually make long-lasting friendships but as long as you get enough of for your socialization needs then that's okay too",
            "I'd say that the vast majority of my friends are present in my life due to common circumstances--we do the same hobbies or we work at the same place or we live in the same area. There are a few people that are lifelong friends that mutually make the effort even when the thing that brought us together is no longer there. But they are rare. \n  \nDo you do anything to foster more personal connections among people that you especially connect with in these groups rather than solely interact in a group setting? If you don't, I'd focus on asking people to do things one-on-one: dinner, drinks, coffee, movies, hikes etc. I think that's where the real friendship stuff tends to happen.",
            "I think this is very common. I was thinking the same thing, in the same situations. Then I realized, I don\u2019t reach out to them, too. I don\u2019t necessarily push them to invite me to their gatherings. For example, people from your old job, maybe they still do the same job and it\u2019s convenient for them to hang out together, and they don\u2019t think about asking you. But would you ask them, in the same situation? Do you reach out and tell them that you want to get into those hangouts? I realized I never do these things. Because I simply don\u2019t want to. Then I stopped feeling sorry for myself because I am not in their gatherings.\n\nMaybe your situation is different, but I think usually people are lazy and just hang out with people who are very easy to hangout with, for them. This might be physical or verbal ease. They may live closer, work closer/or in the same job, they may work in similar professions so they would have similar things to talk about...\n\nFor example, I have a very close friend that I love to hangout with and I know she loves me as well. But I work in academics, I\u2019m a geologist. And she works at a place who gives music lessons and does concerts every once in a while, so she is surrounded by musical people. And I know these people, too, I\u2019ve met them and we got along. But why would she think of inviting me when they are going out? I am not close, she doesn\u2019t see me every day, so she does not think of me everyday. And when I go there, I will not understand the references they\u2019ll make most of the time, they will talk about clients etc. maybe.\n\nBut I know I need to push people into hanging out with me because I am S I C K of academic people lol. So I am working on this, and I figured out that problem is not them, it\u2019s me and my unwillingness to reach out to people.\n\nAgain, your situation might be different and I am only sharing my experience. I am sorry if I offended you.",
            "First off, that's extremely normal for a post-school young adult existence. Most people have their social circle set and aren't really looking for new recruits. Co-workers will often make a polite effort to include you if you get along on the job, but it might not extend too far beyond that, absent a really unique connection, or compelling mutual interest. So you have to meet a lot of people or have a compelling reason to stay connected in order to form those more permanent bonds.\n\nI'm a huge advocate for games, sport and hobbies for that reason, is it gives you a compelling reason to hang out with people who maybe aren't your bestest friend, but you share some interest. For me, that was joining a billiards league. I like playing pool, almost anyone in a pool hall is willing to play pool w a stranger, and because it's often tied to a location, you bump into people you know. Over time you become friends. Most of my closest friends right now, I either met playing pool, or have known since uni/high school. It's hard to make friends outside the context of a shared community.\n\nThe next step is something that we often forget - *you have to* *step up the relationship*. You have to invite them out, or over to your house, propose activity ideas, etc. It's a two-way street. In the same way that the people you're describing didn't make an effort to maintain your friendship, did you really? And I don't mean messaging them, but actually proposing concrete plans in the immediate future that would result in you getting together. I say this as a person who at points has felt lonely as you do, but also was not making an effort to grow my closeness with acquaintances.\n\nLastly, it's for sure hard, and the vast majority of people will never be your friend. But if you can find a way to insert yourself into a community, ie join a pottery class, start doing archery, join a pickup soccer league, start playing tennis, participate in an open mic or a writing group, or a language learner's club, then your odds of meeting potential new friends goes up. Check out the MeetUp in your area and see if there's anything that interests you.",

            "I experience the same thing and here are some things I've found:\n\n- People are busy. A lot of my social life is my coworkers because they're...there..and it's easier to make plans with people who are around you. I used to do the same at my last job and nowadays only see one person frequently and maybe 3-4 others once in a while (out of the 10+ people I used to hang out with)\n- Hangouts tend to be in groups and so everyone likes everyone and it's a good time, but at the end of the day you don't get to bond with individuals that closely. So over time those friendships don't tend to last because there's nothing \"real\" maintaining your relationship.\n\nI have a friend who is really good about maintaining friendships from all over the place. I noticed she puts in a ton of effort to reach out, and even more importantly she hangs with everyone 1:1. So she gets to form real bonds with each person rather than skimming the surface in group settings. It sounds like the issue might be that you make friends as a group rather than individuals.

I send out regular messages to ask how they are or tell them I miss their faces, I snap people with my hilarious and unfortunate stories like my last period and looking like Carrie at prom after I ninja rolled out of bed. I let myself be vulnerable sometimes before they are so they can feel comfortable sharing something deeper than chat about the weather or jobs. I ask them for advice because I can always use another perspective and I like hearing what they think about a problem I have to tackle.\n\nTakes a while to build strong foundations so I'd just say be patient and be ready to say yes more than you say no.",

Sometimes routines change and that doesn\u2019t make the friendship any less special. There are people who I love dearly who I talk to on the phone maybe twice a year and see every few years.

            "> However, there is a thing I've noticed which is that friendships don't seem to stick around a lot of the time. \n\nOh yeah, this is pretty normal in the 20s..  30s..  and beyond..  it's a lot harder to make (and keep) friends when you're an adult.  \n\n> people that I've met and then don't see them that often anymore for some reason, don't seem interested in staying in contact. \n\nYou gotta be proactive and ask people to do stuff with you.  Otherwise people will generally stick to their usual friends groups that they are used to.  Making a new friend can take some time!  Most people are just sort of going with the flow and doing the things they do every day.  \n\nWhat hobbies do you share with the person you want to be closer with?  Focus on those things you have in common, and talk about them together.  Slowly this might transition into a friendship.  Depending on what kind of person this is, they might or might not be more eager to call you or message you out of nowhere in the future.  But this sort of thing takes time\n\n>  I have a hard time finding people who really want to stick around\n\nYeah, everyone's busy and already has their life going on.  I bet they'd be more eager to stick around if you were more active in talking to them every once in a while.  But if you're putting the onus *on them* to talk to you, then..  well, why would they do that?  You're not close friends, they probably don't know much about you.   Plus they're just going with the flow for the most part.\n\nLike I said, making and keeping friends when you're an adult can be a challenge!..  You're not alone though, a lot of us are dealing with very similar issues.\n\nI used to be quite shy myself, and to this day am fairly introverted.  I have found a niche of friends who understand me and with whom I spend a reasonable (to me) amount of time.  I'm happy with our arrangement.  But it's because they got to know me, over months and years, and know that this is who I am.  It took me a while of prodding and hanging out with them, coming out of my zone of comfort every once in a while, to lead to this stage.  You gotta do some of that.\n\nIf you're anything like me, then your social skills are also not as good as they could be.  When I was younger and shy I just didn't practice my social skills at all..  so they were stagnant.  As a result it was much harder for me to read social cues, to act properly in a social situation, and so on.  That made it a lot harder to make and keep friends.  Most of the time I just didn't understand the context of the situation.  People could feel that, and that made it harder for me to connect with them.  The better your social skills are, the easier it will be to connect with people.\n\nMy recommendation is to join a couple social clubs.  In my city there is a sports social club where you can join for this exact reason.  They organize various sporting leagues at various levels..  At the rec level you will find people with all sorts of skill levels..  including many who have never played before.  Everyone knows that this is just for fun, to meet people, and to get some exercise, so nobody takes it too seriously..  and those who do get a talking to..  So it's a nice welcoming atmosphere to make new friends.  especially if you are into any of the sports they organize!\n\nAlternatively join a club like a hiking club, or knitting club, or stamp collecting, or whatever you are into.  It's a lot easier to make friends with someone with whom you share a passionate interest..  even if it's just some specific TV show!  As for hiking/outdoors like clubs, even if you've never done that sort of thing before, give it a try!  Obviously these days you will not go anywhere in a group, but I did this 3 day/night portgaging trip when I joined a group like this..  my first time ever carrying a canoe lol..  my first time ever so far out into the wilderness, camping on some remote island..  It was EPIC!  And those memories, they bind you to people.  All those stories, you will be able to relive them together later.  I met a bunch of people on that trip\n\nJust some ideas!

So you need to find a really clingy friend, and honestly, they can be exhausting at times.

Time, my darling, is something that we are all stressed about, you know, living in a world where literally everything tick-tacks and at some point you just see yourself learn to take it easier, knowing that you simply cannot give the same amount of attention to everybody, not to mention the \"you are really close to me\" type of attention.

And don't get me wrong, but staying close with somebody over the years is definitely an effort, but it also takes connection. The mix of the two is what you are missing, as per your words. I personally have hundreds of ex colleagues who I used to have the best times ever with, but then moving to another job, the people tend to fade away more easily. And that's the thing. It is really difficult to have a mass of people with which you share the above mentioned combination, because it really takes a lot of work to take care of these relationships and we all tend to cut ourselves some slack on that one ;) So, what I mean to tell you is that what you are looking for is something that you need to work for. And after time passes, it will be just a perk of yours, something that you(unlike some people that are just born great at it) will have developed as a skill. Oh, and think a bit less about the \"we should be even\" part. If you want people close, you need to show them that you are not scared of going the extra mile and if it doesn't work, just share a happy smile and move on. It's a learning process, that;s how I see it . Good luck and do your best to be happy!",
            "This is honestly pretty normal. I'm in my 40s and friends cycle in and out of my life, I cycle in and out of friend's lives. \n\nYou can't remain close with every single person you were once tight with. Not every friend is a best friend. There just isn't enough time to keep close contact with \"best friends\" from school, every job you've ever had, every hobby and interest you've ever been engaged in, every friend you've met through every relationship, every gym you've ever gone to.....\n\nPeople move around in life. They change jobs, they change hobbies, they physically move, relationships begin and end, people have kids or kids move out. With each change your friend group will shift a bit. \n\nI'm sure your former co-workers liked you just fine. They didn't suddenly hate you. They were closER with some other people and only had time and energy to focus on those closer friendships once you moved on from the job. \n\nIt's hard to learn not to take it personally, but this IS normal. Clinging and focusing on keeping everyone around is also a good way to push people away. Learn to let go. Better to know this lesson now, then when you get my age you'll take it in stride and save more of your OWN energy for the friendships that deserve it.",
            "How much effort are you putting in? If you're waiting around to see if you matter to them and they are waiting around to see if they matter to you, than everybody is just going to walk away.",
            "Same happens to me. I\u2019m 32, I have very few female friends, the ones I see are connections thru my bfs work. I have not had a best friend or a solid group of friends in 11 years. I have had work friends but as soon as I leave the job those social ties disappear. In HS I had a close knit group of friends, and in College. But literally everyone had children and some type of falling out. My college circle turned out to just be drama fueling jealous people who talked bs about me to everyone. Those old friends still talk bc they have kids in common, no one talks to me tho and for 10 years I was Facebook friends with them but decided to just make a new profile without adding them back bc they never replied to my messages and I got the feeling they just added me to see what I was up to with no genuine interest in forging a long term friendship. It hurt to see everyone still communicating on social media but I was left out. And I knew they would never change and weren\u2019t real friends to begin with. A big reason females may not reach out once you\u2019re gone is jealousy, if you are prettier than average, smart, well liked by men, or good at your career / profession and not just settling down with family duties you could be dealing with envy, women don\u2019t like to be reminded of what they don\u2019t have, nor do they enjoy competing over men when get past 25 and are still single. Many of my old friends were so young when they became mothers and they can\u2019t relate to childless adult women. I\u2019m childless with my man of 6 years and we still love our freedom and spending my spare time practicing self care and spiritual growth. I value my quiet nights, uninterrupted reading, rated R movies, cooking for 2 (not 4 or 5) and partying on the occasion. I dealt with tons of jealousy and hate from women in my past just bc guys always wanted to know about me and I am not bragging but I am good at a lot of things I pursue. I also work very hard to be successful at my own small business but this is a fact people don\u2019t want to acknowledge when they are simply jealous. Just be a good person and focus on you.. many individuals don\u2019t even want friends they are just looking for a spouse. You\u2019re hitting that age where connections from your younger life will spread farther apart until there\u2019s barely anything holding you together anymore. It\u2019s just a natural part of life. Get a cat (I recommend a boy, more playful), animals make great friends. You could always start your own meetup group or make a Facebook group for people of your same age, interests, and lifestyle. But reaching into the past rarely works as you are growing and changing. You can still find and create social opportunities amongst new people in this new chapter of your life.",
            "I [25F] have the same problem but I would say it comes from both sides. Once I and friends diverge from each other's lives it's tough to stay in touch",
            "I'm the same way in that if I become good friends with a group I will actually try to keep some semblance of contact and try to arrange visits before it gets too long, but I've learned that some people just can't be bothered. I think for a lot of people it's just normal to stop putting in effort to maintain friendships, or try to keep some superficial version that entirely consists of stray social media comments.",
            "I have the exact same problem.  Especially becomes a problem with people ending up living in different places and things like that.  Feels like I end up falling out of touch with a lot of people and then end up in situations where I don't know if other people even want to see me.\n\nI think you just have to really make clear plans to meet up with people.  Reach out to people and then try to make specific plans - go here, do this, etc.  Tough to remain connected to people without sharing hobbies or other things.  Maybe when you reach out to someone, have something specific you want to do - eat at this restaurant, see this music act, hike this mountain, etc.  Reach out to people with a purpose already in mind.",
            "This is just kind of how it works with most adults.",
            "Very relatable. I used to blame myself years ago, wondering if it was something to do with me. It bothered me a lot, and caused a lot of issues for my self esteem. However, that was until I realised that most people are just shit at keeping in contact with each other. Not to mention that if they'd really valued your friendship, they would have stuck around. Those who wind up leaving aren't a reflection of who you are, there are a thousand reasons that could have happened. \n\nIt's made my life a lot easier in recognition of this. If someone really wants to keep you in their life, you'll know. And I'm sure you will find someone like that soon :)",
            "pretty normal if you are in job.",
            "There's some people who you only consider friends because you're with them five days a week. True, long term friendship is much, much rarer. Your situation is more than normal, try not to worry and keep putting yourself out there!",
            "It'll change. But it's hard in your late twenties and thirties because people become closer knit, are more family or career orientated. The best thing to do is focus on hobbies and things you know you'll do forever and look to your immediate community for people who over time might become friends. Sometimes it's as simple as enjoying a hobby or volunteering. Other times it's circumstances of how you connect to your wider community.",
            "Hello other yogurt, I feel the same way. I\u2019ve always felt like I was the disposable friend. There have definitely been times where I have shunned away from some friends because they came off very strong and I didn\u2019t know how to handle it so I do blame myself for that, I don\u2019t think I had the best communication skills when I was younger and I couldn\u2019t handle it if someone wanted more from me than I was willing to give in terms of friendship. It often weighs on my mind and I feel so guilty. Some have suggested to reach out again but it feel opportunistic at this point. I don\u2019t know how to navigate these situations. I know how hurt I\u2019d feel if someone came back into my life wanting to re-connect and I don\u2019t know if I could handle the rejection.",

Then you will have a couple other types of friends like seasonal or on the surface friends, hobby friends, and then your genuine friends.\n\nIt's not you, it's the majority of adults whose lives become more individualized and less group oriented.",
            "Seems normal to me! I have made probably well over a hundred friends in my life (childhood friends, high school friends, college friends, camp friends, coworkers, club friends, etc.) and I have maybe 3 people that I consistently stay in contact with. Maintaining friendships is rewarding but it's a lot of work! I would focus on 1-3 people in your life that you really value and work on maintaining those relationships. I would say it's totally normal to only have a small handful of really good friends that stay with you throughout your life.",
            "I think this is normal, especially as you get older. People tend to hang out in \u201cconvenience clusters\u201d, such as coworkers, new parents, hobbyists or just with family. Im also socially outgoing and likeable but don\u2019t feel like I have too many friends. I lost my \u201ccouples friends\u201d when my ex and I split, I hang out a lot with my siblings, and have one good friend and a handful of friends that are activity based (one to hike with, a couple to drink/brunch with, one to go to plays/events with, etc). Unless you\u2019re in the same city (usually smaller city or small town) and have continually hung out with the same group of people since childhood/high school, you\u2019re going to experience fragmented friendships. Often, your coworkers become your \u201ctribe\u201d or social circle, but leaving a job also means leaving that commonality behind.\n\nTry to be consistent with people if you\u2019d like to continue growing the friendship and building bonds. Otherwise, enjoy people as they come into your life and accept they may not stay forever. Sometimes all you really need is one good friend :)",
            "Sounds pretty normal. I have one friend whose been in my life for 10 years. I have a few from high school I keep limited contact with, I no longer live there so it\u2019s sometimes difficult. I have newer friendships but nothing as meaningful as my older friendships",
            "I agree with the people that are saying \"friendships are a two way street\". You have just as much responsibility to reach out as they do. I would like to add something else however. You said you have a single friend you are close with and all other groups of friends have fallen through. Maybe this is because you have been focused on group friendships instead of individual ones. I don't really have enough info in your life to back this up. But it's something to cont. People like one on one interaction, it's how personal relationships grow outside of group settings",
            "Thank you for posting this. I am right there with you! Heck if the responders of this post all lived in the same community, we could make some lasting friendships.",
            "It's how most relationships are as you get older.  They take a lot of work to maintain.",
            "I think this is something we all go through but perhaps you just perceive it differently from others. \n\nI could literally name so many friends that I\u2019ve made but haven\u2019t kept up with over the years. Some close - some work friends, even family! But I don\u2019t perceive that as losing them or anything, I just see it life changes and people usually make new friends in their new lifestyle.\n\nYou changed job for example - we have all been there. Did you make new friends at your new job? Because that\u2019s a pretty normal transition. \n\nMoved house/ area? Make new friends at a book club/ sports / games whatever you are into.\n\nSounds like you are holding on to old relationships when you should be looking at new ones. Maybe!!?",
            "I would say, maybe it was different before video games and Netflix kept people at home more, it is difficult to make friendships as you grow into adulthood and beyond. People have families, get new jobs, shut themselves in at home because it's easy to play video games or turn on Netflix, Hulu, HBO, etc.\n\nIt really sucks because I enjoy being social and having close friendships. It is difficult for me too. (This virus is making me struggle with loneliness for sure.)",
            "Yup. This I\u2019m in the exact same boat verbatim. I\u2019m guessing this is just spat of growing up. I do want to know What some of the other replies say though.",
            "This sounds normal. When I was your age I found that a lot of my peers (and myself) seemed to be going through something disorienting, akin to puberty or a midlife crisis, but not as severe. We seem to have come out of it on the other side in good shape. My mom used to tell me if you had one or two really close friends by 30 you were in good shape. As I\u2019m pushing 40 I\u2019ve realized how right she was. Don\u2019t worry too much. Just be you and ride it out.",
            "Well this describes me perfectly too. I am only friends with people because I am always the one initiating/organising etc. And I've realised this in the past few years, so almost everyone from before then (barring a special few that also put in effort) has faded out because I thought it should be a 2 way street. I organise a catch up, then they should. But just because people don't organise things doesn't mean they don't care. Some people are just not good at it. You need to decide who is worth the effort.",
            "I guess it just takes time to find the right people who will stick to you. I also only one friend like that but I try my best to communicate with old friends so I don't go out of touch.",
            "I've had this problem, and I've realised that it's because I don't initiate contact as much as people do with me. I know it stems from a minor anxiety of being 'the host' and responsible for people's friendships (my parents were a little overprotective, so I usually had more fun at other people's houses and preferred to go out rather than invite people round).\n\nAny time I've felt left out, I've easily rationalized it as 'well I suppose I haven't reached out/rang/met up with them recently, why should I expect it?'. Friendship goes both ways, and work relationships often tail off naturally regardless of how close you seem. The majority of people have good work buddies, but real life friends too. God knows I love my colleagues, and they probably know me better than some of my friends do, but I don't really speak to them much outside work.",
            "I disagree with the majority of posters. If you are as normal and friendly as you say, something else must be the cause for your lack of connections with others. In my case, I realized I have trust issues due to my childhood and just let never expected anyone to be there for me long term, so I treated them as acquaintances, never let myself get vulnerable around them, and that was that. I didn\u2019t realize that was a self fulfilling prophecy that caused me to not make any deep friendships while also craving them so badly and wondering what\u2019s wrong with me!",
            "Honestly I relate to this a lot. That\u2019s part of the reason this year I decided to start focusing on doing more individual activities that make me happy and being more comfortable hanging out with just myself. I feel like it\u2019s very hard to do this for a lot of people (myself included) but worthwhile as it allows you to not rely on people as much and have a good relationship with yourself :)",
            "I think you need to manage your expectations.\n\nWhat you describe is typical for the vast majority of people.\nBest to have outside interests and hobbies that put you in contact with other people.\n\nYour schoolmates, for example, were in your life solely from when and where you were born.\nYour former workmates have only that connection, which was severed when you left.\n\nWhile I agree that it would be nice to stay more closely connected with people you were once simpatico with, life gets in the way.",
            "From my experience, people for the most part are selfish and manipulative.  If you exercise caution and control your environment, it is not as funny to play you and therefore you are no fun to be around.  I will give some anecdotal examples, please do not take them as end-all be-all facts.\n\nFrom elementary to high school I have kept my room clean and could tell immediately if something is missing.  When \"friends\" came over, sometimes a He-Man would go missing or in my later years a few CDs from my shelf.  I would pause all proceedings and demand to have them returned.  They would try to play it off like first I am paranoid and crazy, and then with ridicule and disdain for me being paranoid and crazy for ALWAYS looking out for my stuff as they would shamelessly pull my CDs from underneath their jacket and hand them back to me before leaving and never to speak to me again.\n\nThrough college and my young adult years I tried the dating thing.  Similar concept.  Not only did my clean upkeep and fastidious organization throw off some prospective partners and resulted in me being called gay and the f-word because \"no real man would be such a prissy housekeeper\", but casual friends would be put off by the fact that I always knew where my wallet and car keys were, as well as the security system on my apartment.\n\nI am disabled.  I have been bullied and picked on and have had stuff stolen from me all through school.  Even after I had graduated, my parents' mailbox would be smashed over constantly and there would be beer cans and a pile of cigarettes at the end of our driveway on some mornings, just because it was funny to pick on someone with a genetic defect.  So forgive me if I take steps to prevent from being a fun object to poke at.\n\nEven now, it is clear that social services and society in general gets to pick and choose who gets to succeed at being social and productive.  People are image oriented and usually defines themselves by the people that they surround themselves with.  They entertain a head movie about being the star of their own Netflix series, and they are the casting agent that decides whether or not you belong simply by how aesthetic you are or your countenance.  Some people who plan for the long term want safe and predictable.  Long-term planners, like me, are fragile and scared and want to keep our routine.  But a lot of people wants dangerous and spontaneous, because of idk extrovert and YOLO reasons.  So whether or not you get picked to receive government benefits from a caseworker, or if you get called back to play another round of D&D with that one meetup group, may depend on something as superficial and stupid as how you appear from your left profile with your head turned because it reminded them of a weird and creepy uncle, for example.\n\nI am 41.  I still have no meaningful friends that I can just call up and sort out my thoughts with.  People only tolerate me for just as long as until their primary option becomes available.  Even my last two therapists have agreed that despite my genetic condition, it is not me who needs counseling, but rather it is the society as a whole who has always had their innate, covert disdain for weird, ugly people from the beginning of time, and it is up to me how I respond to/deal with it.  I have only, in the last month, discovered a decent roommate who does not steal from me or humiliate me in front of his friends just because I had spammed all of my recent AirBNB hosts begging for a place to stay and he had happened to be the ONLY ONE to respond in the affirmative.\n\nPerhaps it is not you.  Maybe you just have to keep playing the social lottery and keep reaching out and striking up conversations, keeping in mind that you will never attain the perfect friend or companion that meets all of your prerequisites.  Maybe you will find a great listener, but she smokes weed.  Or you can find the great hangout companion who always pay their own way when going out, but they have Bell's palsy.  Or you can find the perfect boyfriend who manages his finances and would never hurt you or leave you, but he is an introvert who pays for his own public transit instead of owning a car, and he requires six hours of Minecrafting per day to stay relatively sane.  No one is perfect.  To combat loneliness, you have to be prepared to accept others' faults as you want them to accept your own.\n\nHope this helps!",

            "Well the thing is that this is just how things are as you get older and it\u2019s even worse now because of the way society has become.

Sure some people suck and you are better off without them, but others don\u2019t even realize that you feel how you do. People get busy and caught up with their lives and distance from multiple people only to then wonder where everyone went, not realizing those people feel the same way about them!

Trivial pursuit Tuesday clubs? Do that. Knitting Circle Saturday\u2019s? That\u2019s a go. Cultivate your interests not people and you will meat people who are equally interested in the same things.

The same with things like school, sports, or any group. Once those things ends, or you leave, people move on. \n\nIt's just about developing solid friendships outside of anything else.

In the year I've been on it I have made one (ONE!!) solid friendship. This girl feels like soul family, and we message each other almost every day. \n\nMost people are nice but unless you truly click with someone, why would they make you a priority over others?

I only have one group of friends I\u2019m still very close to from a past job (we all worked at chipotle), like family.... and from that group of about 10 people, I\u2019m only really close with about 4 of them still. Other co workers from other jobs, I\u2019ve just remained friends with on social media, but honestly life goes on and there\u2019s a reason people don\u2019t stick around. I hear from them here or there on a comment or story reply. We always do the \u201cwe should go out soon!\u201d about 3 times a year and still never do it lol. They just aren\u2019t meant to be in your life anymore. You can\u2019t force it and shouldn\u2019t focus on it too much. A lot of people have different circumstances, some people have kids or go on to get married or change career paths. It just happens. Like just a year ago, I had a really close co worker. We cracked up all the time and she really got me through a rough patch at one point with my ex, but now a year later her and I don\u2019t talk. She\u2019s engaged to another co worker we worked with and she quite shortly before Christmas. It is what it is. I just wished her well and grateful for the time she was apart of my daily life. \n\nI also have a handful of friends from college, who will be lifelong friends as well but I don\u2019t see them very often either. It\u2019s sad at first, when you can feel those relationships distancing, but what matters is they\u2019re still there. Just have to be happy for them and if they\u2019re true friends they\u2019re happy and proud of you as well doing whatever you\u2019re doing in life. \n\nI believe the most important thing is having at least one solid friendship, one you can count on for anything if you needed it and vice versa. I have a best friend who I\u2019ve known since we were 12. I can\u2019t be around her too long, because we are just different now and I don\u2019t like her boyfriend lol, but I\u2019ll always be her friend. Other than that, people come and go. It\u2019s definitely nothing personal",
            "Just like with dating, 90% of friendships don't last. I try to just be greatful for the chapter of my story those friends were a part of, but recognize that I'm in a new chapter now, and that's ok. A very few of my friends have managed to stay in touch for the long haul, and even then there have been periods of long distance or not keeping touch. But with the really good ones, you realize that they are \"your person\"s and it's ok that most other people don't fit you as well as they do, because what you have with them is special. You just have to weed through a lot of temporary and side dish friends before you find the ones that are your main course and gonna last.",

I just don\u2019t seem to bond with others the same way some people can. \n\nWhen I\u2019m working with someone, I can have normal, sometimes fun conversation but I guess I\u2019m not really the type of person someone is like dying to hang out with. But it could also be because at work, we see each other so much that we don\u2019t want to see each other even more outside of work.\n\nEither way, I think it\u2019s fairly normal and I just try to ~live in the moment, enjoy the time I currently have with people and try not to get super invested in the relationship. It can be lonesome not having people to hang out with outside of work but I work 5 days a week, so I if I do get lonely, I remind myself that I\u2019ll be back to chatting with my co-workers very soon.",
            "I've suffered from social anxiety for a long time and I finally started taking an amazing medication about 4 years ago.  First for emergencies.  Then more often.  Then daily.  The medication was amazing for quashing my anxiety.  I felt brave in social situations...it was like a courage pill.   4 years later I realize it might have helped my anxiety tremendously...but it did something else I didn't notice at first.  That filter between my brain and my mouth that kicks-in when you are thinking about saying something...was gone.  I didn't realize it but I had become what others must have seen as...an asshole.  I'm really not...I'm kind, shy, introverted...I'm a Buddhist.  But that filter is critical to healthy social relationships and I had boned myself.\n\nToday I am like you.  My world is small.

            "I (25F) have a similar issue. I had a pretty solid social group throughout elementary and middle school but when I moved to a new high school 20 minutes away I lost contact with them all. Since graduating high school I\u2019ve lost contact with my tight knit high school group as well, with the except of one person who has stuck around for the better part of 11 years now. In college I briefly reconnected with a couple friends from middle school but again they dropped off the face of the earth as soon as they transferred out of my college. It seems like everything is about convenience these days. If you\u2019re not in front of them or next to them day in and day out they don\u2019t care. Of course this goes both ways but I totally get it\u2019s exhausting always being the one to make the effort. I think the best suggestion is to find a hobby and meet people through that rather than relying on coworkers or old school friends. I personally haven\u2019t done that yet but my family was involved in a hobby together throughout childhood; my parents are still friends with another couple they met through that hobby around 16 years ago despite my mother and the other couple all no longer participating in that group. If that\u2019s not a positive example in favor of friends through hobby groups I don\u2019t know what is! Best of luck!",
            "Okay, there's a lot to do about making lasting friendships (says one who has only recently learnt the skill!) . One, definitely talk about your values - for example if you hate Trump make sure early on your friend is on the same page. Same goes for homophobia, racism, love of dogs ... I don't know. What ever's important to you. Next, be generous. With your time, your money, and your things. Not overly so, but don't give, expecting to receive. And finally, be fun. Find the ridiculous in situations, learn to laugh at stuff (not people!) but the absurd, which is all around you if you only look. Good luck!",
            "Friendships ebb and flow, depending on life circumstances, and it can be tough.  I am closest to the friends who I spend time with on a regular basis.  My old friends and I stay in touch but it's challenging when we can't see each other as often as we would like to.  It seems like you may be in a similar situation, where you really need to spend time with people in order to stay close with them.\n\nBeing friends with former co-workers is especially challenging and a little awkward after you leave a job.  You get used to spending 40 hours a week with those people and it's impossible to maintain that level of contact when you no longer work together.\n\nMy best advice is to treasure the people who are in your life in the present moment.  These are your friends.  They may not be the friends you have had before or the friends you expected to have but you can learn something from all of them.  Try to appreciate the people around you who you are able to spend time with.\n\nUsually I would not recommend reaching out to old friends, as it can be emotionally exhausting to force a friendship when time and distance are obstacles, but now (with coronavirus quarantines and social distancing) would be a great time to send some messages out to those former friends.\n\nAdult friendships are strange.",
            "I guess that's pretty common when you're an adult, normal however disappointing. I'm nearly a decade older than you and slowly getting used to the fact, that people I would consider friends 5,10,15 years ago, are now present in my life only as a birthday and holiday greeting, an occasional Facebook like and \"hello\" if we walk into each other in a street.",
            "When the quarantine is over, you should find a social hobby to engage in. The people you meet there won't be work friends and you can be more open with them. Making work friends is like dating at work almost - if anything were to go sour, you still have to work together, which would be uncomfortable. \n\nTake a class, join a club or society, volunteer, etc. Do you like board games? Gardening? Wanna learn to dance or hike? Wanna join the modern witch movement and learn tarot? There are a lot of things that will bring you around people. \n\nAnother way to get closer with people is to meet 1 on 1 like others have said. But be a little more vulnerable with them. If I'm sad, sometimes I will tell a newer friend how I feel and say, \"Im kinda sad, wanna watch movies or play board games on friday?\" \n\nBest luck. I also started being an organizer among my friends. I send a group message to some ladies I know and say, \"Hey, I am going for a hike on the 30th, who would like to come along?\" Maybe if you started organizing some activities, people would reach out to you as well. :)",
            "Perhaps the friendships aren\u2019t deep enough to be able to persist over time and distance?

Truly sharing yourself with others is the key to deep and lasting friendships.",

            "It sucks, but I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s pretty normal. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about you or your personality.\n\nI\u2019m also struggling with it. With very few exceptions, people just don\u2019t keep in touch if they don\u2019t see you as often. Most of them only really care about work, family and their romantic partner. Many people say they don\u2019t have the time for long-distance (or even shorter distance) friendships. But the truth is, it\u2019s a matter of priorities.",
            "It sounds like your social anxiety still exists to some degree. I had this EXACT conversation with my therapist and she pointed out some things that made it a lot easier to deal with. Adult friendships are like this, they expand and contract. Any relationship, really. But in adulthood everyone's lives are moving in different directions and friendships take a lot more effort. \n\nTalking to my therapist about it, I realized that I was perceiving that people didn't want me around and I was distancing myself in response to that. I was always leaving the ball in their court, because I didn't want to burden them with my presence and make them uncomfortable. I was waiting for them to prove that they wanted me around. But they're busy with their lives, and why would they put all of the effort into a friendship that I appeared, to them, disinterested in?\n\nAfter wrapping my head around that, I learned to just trust people and ignore that nagging suspicion. That's social anxiety, and you can learn to drown it out. My best friend of 10 years, we'll go months without talking sometimes. But then we get back in touch and it's just the same as always. We're both busy and we know that. \n\nReach out to people! Find out who your friends really are. Friendships take work from all parties.",

            "I can confirm with other comments here. Having a long term true friend is not just with any body. You need to share some mutual interest beyond just knowing each other or working together. Other wise I too don't care to keep in touch nor even talk to them.\n\nOut of 120 or so high school friends, 20 years later I only chat and hang out with a small group of 6. And it doesn't happen that regularly. Twice a year or so.\n\nOut of 400+ coworkers I've work with, only 3-4 I keep in touch regularly. Others I still recognize them and even follow some of their works but no we don't usually talk without business.\n\nThe people I've known and still keep in touch for the longest time, guess what, were the Final Fantasy player gang that frequent the same web forum over 25 years ago.",

If you're  a bummer then adjust your attitude as much as possible around new friends.

So let's assume that you are a nice person who treats their friends with respect.\n\nHowever I can't shake the feeling that you are rather dominant in a friendship. By dominant I mean that you like to be heard, and you mind if something happens in the group not according to your plans. You want to know everyrhing that happens around you and you feel embarassed maybe even angry if you don't something about your friends because you let them know everything about yourself and care about them a bit too much sometimes. From outside a person like that seems strong, but people like this care about the opinion of others and if my guess is right that is why you are concerned about them not contacting you and that's why you asked for advice and tips here. I don't think that this is the first place where you asked for help and that is because others who know you didn't give you a satisfying answer I wonder. Maybe you know this, and you need some people to confirm you that you are right. But since I'm not you so I don't know, if your personality has flaws I can't really spot them as all of this was based on a guess if I offended you in any way please accept my apology.\n\nBut this part is not based on a guess: people have their own lives, they just try to live it and don' t be suprised if they don't have time for you in the end of the day. If you want them in your life don't wait for them to come to you, you would just waste you time with that. Here is an example: for 4 years I practiced kendo and built some pretty strong friendships, but I had to leave the team, a few months ago I was kind pf on the downslope of life so desperately needing someone I contacted them. And to my suprise they were happy to see me again. So if you want them, contact them, stay with them and they will stay with you.\n\nAgain, if I offended you I'm sorry, I hope I could help you with my toughts.",

I still have pretty bad anxiety but if I want to go out and do something or if I want to go talk to people I just do. I like to face my fears I guess. Ive gotten quite a few friends in college and for a while it was wonderful to kind of always have someone I can talk to or to have a variety of people to hang out with. If I wanted to go do something and didnt want to do it alone I knew there would be someone who would come with and they all seemed to like me. I recently gained a lot of weight and started getting really down. I do try to be really positive when im around people but if they ask me how im doing or how my life is there really isnt any thing good to say so my options are usually to say nothing because there is nothing.  So those people have faded away and now I never leave the house. Im alone all the time. I have two friends that I talk to a lot but they live in different states. Now I try to make friends at work because thats were ive gotten most of my friends previously in every job ive ever worked and its like they all really like talking to me here but they dont actually consider me their friend. They tell me about what they did with their friends but Im never invited. Im never really considered. They all have my number but they would never text me so sometimes I take the intiative and text them and its fine but still sort of distanced. It feels really bad. Like im just not good enough anymore. I dont know what im doing wrong. Most of the people I work with are guys so maybe theyre afraid ill take it the wrong way but I feel like ive made it clear that I want to be friends.

People go to work for money, a friend based in work is just entertainment to pass the time.  You might want to brach out and get a hobby a make friends with people who are passionate about the same things yo ugg are into.",

When someone grows out of those common interest or  places they normally pursue other people. \n\nI had many buddies during the rave days- when i grew out of the club scene we came apart. Try to find people who are genuine and sincere- they'll usually be interested in you as a person and not for a place or thing in common. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm always reminded of this: People come into our lives for a season, a reason, or a lifetime.",
            "So this may be awkward for you but you could always ask someone rather than asking a bunch of stranger on reddit.  If you have a particular old friend that you don't keep up with, call them up and say \"Hey, I've been doing a lot of introspection and self improvement and wanted to know if you think our friendship just ran it's natural course or if there's something I did that caused you not to maintain it?\"  Be sure to be completely honest with yourself first if this is something you've let drop and hold yourself accountable/responsible too though.",

Some people are just natural born people magnets and they make people want to be their friends. The way I see it is if they choose not to be your friend, then screw em. It's true that any form of -ship is a two way street. You can't always expect to get and not give and you can't always be the one giving. It can be a bit lonely but as you get older, you do lose more friends than you gain, but then you start to value their friendship.",

            "One other thing that I didn't see mentioned is the amount of effort required to maintain friendships. The older you get the more it takes. It's easiest in high school and college but once people have lives going on and you aren't around regularly (work) most of the time it just fades. If there are particular people you really want to stay friends with then you need to be the leader in the friendship. \n\nI am terrible at doing this. I've had some extremely close friends over my life that have faded because I don't make enough of an effort. My friends have made attempts and when we do see each other it's like the friendship never ended but then it just fades again. I'm not being a victim, I'm aware of my behavior and the energy that I am willing to put into something. I have a couple close friends that I keep in my life and aside from that I'm just not interested in maintaining others. \n\nThe percentage of people that can make the jump from work friend to life friend is very very low. When you're around all the time you can have work to bond you, but once that's gone, usually the friendship just goes away unless one party is adamant in maintaining it.",

I was guilty of that too and I swear people can smell that shit from miles away and it makes them want to hang out less. \nSo my advise would be, do you, be you and select your friends by their morals and personality and not just anyone who's acceptably nice. Other people are drawn to those who give less fucks and don't act like they would do anything to please them.",

I had one best friend, who was a coworker as well, in my mid to late 30\u2019s who eventually stopped communicating. I got into a serious ltr then married but I still tried to reach out and stay connected. It just became increasingly hard to engage her in conversation.

            "This is something everyone comes to terms with in their late 20s: most friendships are out of convenience. It's nothing personal, and I'm sure if you were around these friends more you would pick up where you left off.

Actually it's worse if you're looking at it through 26 year old eyes. However 40 year old eyes see me as much more emotionally together than 26. I needed  1 friend because then I would have none and who would pick me up when i was down, or tell me I look pretty ?. I don't need that anymore. I don't really need any friends. I have good people I can confide in if I choose, but that only happens once Ive exhausted the mirror. Why better? Because everything that I think and feel are 100% mine. I'm not drawing off anyone else and I like it that way. It kreps me authentic and accountable to myself. You need you more than anyone else. So make you come first always and love yourself the most \u2661 Friends come and go. Enjoy the connections. Maybe you just outgrow them faster than others. Not a bad thing. Can't grow if the roots are crowded;)",

Those are likely to be the only relationships that are maintained once people move/change jobs.",
            "This is normal, and so are your feelings. Relationships are work, and most people don't go out of their way to keep in touch with more than a few people in their lives. The easiest way I've been able to keep in touch with people is through shared interests. For me, it's videogames and D&D (which is a social game I play online with friends) and the communities I'm a part of I talk to more than with people I've met irl.\n\nMost friendships don't really last beyond physically being around each other, and it's hard to keep in contact if you don't really have a reason to chat.\n\nEdit: beyond not being lol",
            "You sound like these bonds you're trying to keep are not actually \"friends\" in the true sense of the word. They're acquaintances based on a common work environment.  Just like classmates often drift apart after school,  workmates do after someone moves on.\n\nOur bonds tend to fit somewhere on a spectrum.  You have you're ultra-close ride or dies. They're actually pretty rare.\n\nThen some friends that won't betray you, but are only in our lives for a season. They can be pretty close, or not so much. Some people are in our lives to share an experience.  Like neighbors,  cancer-friends, coworkers,  schoolmates,  etc. They also range on a spectrum. \n\nTrue friendship tends to come more from common interests,  passion or values (or some combination of these). I suggest you look for bonds where you find these things in common. \n\nIf you're an artist,  find other artists.  If you're a writer,  find other writers. If you're political,  join a group. \n\nIn the meantime,  you might find that you're only going to have one or two ride or die close friends.  That's ok.  \n\nIt's also possible that you have a tendency to bond more quickly than others,  so you misread the type of friendship you have. \n\nThere is a remote chance that you can't form these bonds more often because you're slightly out of sync with society in some way. Not big enough to doom you to \"sitting alone at the lunch table\", so to speak,  but big enough to make ppl keep you comfortably separated once you're not there. How far you want to investigate that possibility is up to you, and the information you gain in that search might not serve you well once you start. You can't change society and might not want to change yourself to fit in.\n\nIn any case, you do you to the best of your ability.  Be the type of person you would want to have as a friend. New experiences might bring new ppl into your life, enrich it for a time. But it might not be the permanent kind, and that's ok. Appreciate it for as long as you have it.",

I too don't have a ton of friends but I still try and make plans even if I know it's not exactly how I want our relationship to go. Respecting that people do have to meet you halfway on maintaining a relationship may take a lot of the pressure off you. It doesn't sound like there is anything wrong with you.\n\nI have also found it really hard to break into a friend group especially if they have know each other for longer. That also might be happening where you were a bonus when you hung out with your friend group but are not an OG.",

            "Yeah, it's difficult. Really the main way I have seen people have consistent friendships is through hobbies (ex. sports). I just enjoy being around specific people, but for almost everybody else, unless you have a set schedule, it seems like you are out of their lives.",
            "It happens a lot... in general, to everyone. \n\nI don't take it personally. Although, a lot of my previous friends do try to stay in touch, for the most part. I think part of that is I just act like myself, I speak my mind, I'm also aware of how I can impact others. If you're someone who has minimal influence/impact on others, I think it's a lot easier for them to forget you. If you're a person with a lot of presence, people will either love or hate you a lot more, or you'll find people forget you less.\n\nI suggest you think about why this bothers you. Do you feel people don't make enough of an effort when you *do*? Do you make an effort at all?",

After a while, so much time has passed that it feels awkward to reach out.\n\nTook me paying a therapist to realize it goes both ways, you know? They might be feeling the same on the other end. That's not to say it's your fault - again, human behavior. If you're thinking of someone, shoot them a message. Nothing weird about it.",
            "When I graduated college I had one group a friends that I would go to bars with and party with, then I went to grad school and had a different group of friends for 2 years, then I moved across the country and made new friends for a year, then I joined a kickball team and made new friends for 3 years, then all those friends moved on with their lives to start families, and now I'm on a new group of friends.  Seems like every 3-5 years I move on to a new group of friends as my hobbies and life stage change.",
            "It definitely is tough. Only through this forum I realized that it could be normal to develop adult friendships. I can really relate to you\n\nI also struggled throughout my life to hold on to a consistent friendship. I remember having \"good\" friends during each important phase of my life (high school, uni, my first job etc) but none of them stayed in contact with me. I am a very outgoing person myself and I always checked in on people by texting them first, asking them how they are and even going above and beyond by trying to make conversation about things they particularly were interested in. For the longest time I even went out of my way to help people in hopes that they would reciprocate the friendship. I helped them get jobs, helped them through emotional trauma and even offered to pay to ease some of their burdens. None of it helped. I learned it the painful way. It also didn't help that I got married to a person who has had the same friends since her high school years and they are the tightest crew I've ever seen. I definitely thought something was wrong with me as a person. That ate at my self-esteem.\n\nI think the only thing that's really helped me has been to just keep trying. One person told me that you might not have found your \"tribe\" just yet but they are out there. That's the piece of advice I was given. Perhaps the people I met before just weren't as similar to me that I would have initially liked to believe. I joined a sports league and met a bunch of people there.. then suddenly I joined another and had more company. It's still not nearly perfect but things are better. Perhaps it might help to find something you're really interested in and join a community and give it some time. I know how hard it can be.",
            "Have you tried keeping in touch with any of them or even requesting hang outs? \n\nIt is normal to lose some, but you also have to put in some effort to keep friends. I dont know what you're doing except pointing out you notice things change after you're separated from people you were once in contact with.",
            "/u/MelancholicYoghurt \n\n\n\n> So, what I've done to stay connected: for example with my old coworkers, I created a facebook group. People were excited and asked to be invited there, and for a while various people posted every now and then. But when we got to point eventually where the last 5 posts or so were all from me and nobody really reacted anymore, I stopped. Likewise I invited everyone to meet in our favorite bar, and everybody came, to my surprise. So that was good, but afterwards I kind of waited for someone else from the group to create the next meetup, and nothing ever happened. I don't like being the only one showing initiative because then I feel like I am being clingy and annoying people.  \n\nI 100% agree with you. Even with friendships, being the only showing initiative is annoying. The fact is, most people can't be bothered to put in the effort.  \n\n> Also, some people here have speculated that I'm probably a shallow attention wh*re. I wouldn't agree, I am actually a rather quiet person, and in the past had to work on that because I got the feedback from some friends that I can make an intimidating or kind of 'fuck off' impression at first. I think however this has hugely improved by now.  \n\nI kind of do this on purpose, because I'm pretty picky about who I'm friends with.",
            "I went through this exact thing at your age, I\u2019m 28 now but from about 24-26 my friendship life brought me a lot of pain and feeling rejected. It\u2019s really annoying to say this because I know it\u2019s far too simple of an answer - but it really is fairly normal. Part of growing pains is moving from that phase of having lots of friends in that adolescent era to finding a small few close friends and the kind of friends you have real adult relationships with. With that comes losing a LOT of people. It\u2019s normal, but that doesn\u2019t make us easy. I\u2019m still recovering from some really rough times, and things aren\u2019t perfect but they HAVE improved. I think a lot of it has honestly been growth and I feel like I\u2019m at least on the upswing now and looking forward to friendships in my thirties and find myself craving loyalty, consistency and stability more than other things I used to value. I hope things get better for you, but in the meantime please try and not be hard on yourself or fall into the habit of being self critical and looking for problems within yourself. Don\u2019t try and force any friendships and instead think about the people in your life who DO ask you to hang out or spend time with you and maybe put more effort into those. It\u2019s really easy to only focus on those you feel rejection from and obsess over what went wrong or how you can make it work. Don\u2019t overlook any neighbors, coworkers or online friends who DO want to spend time with you. The right people will come along as well, join some local FB groups or find some activities you can join in your town if you want to find some completely new folks. Good luck to you",
            "Are you me? Lol just kidding. It\u2019s completely normal for most of our friendships to slip away. There will be a few that stick for life, the rest you just have to appreciate for what they were and move on.",
            "Unfortunately some people are like that.  The only time they talk to you is when you are around. But once you leave it's like they don't know you.  You just have to meet the right people.  I stay in contact with people I met when I was in the military. Also with the people I met in school after the military. Just keep your head up and you will find true friends.",
            "It's perfectly normal. It happens to all of us. I (26M) had more friends at school than I do now and there are people I still view as friends but probably speak to once or twice a year, some even less than that. It's not intentional it's just that life gets in the way and we struggle to make the time to fit friends in. If you put the time in you will make friends. The challenge is keeping them by consistently making the time to see them. That's where adult life and responsibilities gets in the way and where most friendships struggle as you get older.",
            "I think this is just part of adult friendships. It's really common not to keep in touch with old co-workers. Your whole friendship was based on seeing each other all the time, and when you take that away it's pretty rare for it to turn into a more natural friendship. That's happened at every place I've ever worked. It's also super common to outgrow your high school friends. Almost everyone does, and truthfully the people that don't often are kind of \"stuck\" in high school. \n\nWhen you're young, a lot of your friends come out of the fact that you see the same group of people every day in school. As adults, it's a lot harder to make and keep new friends. People are a lot busier, they all have different schedules. People get married and drop friends, or have kids and get busy. It's pretty impossible to find a good \"gang\" of friends again, never mind making new friends. \n\nI'd look into fostering new friendships with people outside of work. Join a meetup group, start volunteering, join church if that's your thing, get a dog and take it to the dog park every day, take a class at a community center. If you meet people you get along with well, ask them if they'd like to do something else sometimes. But not everyone is interested in making new friends either, or good at being friends. \n\nBe patient. Everything you're saying it totally normal, and you're at the exact age when people start saying \"How do adults make/keep friends?\"",

Obviously for a long time I didn\u2019t think about it as a kid but when I got older I started thinking he might be gay.\n\nThere\u2019s also this guy \u201cJohn.\u201d I don\u2019t know him that well but like he\u2019s visited us 1-2 times a year over the years even though we live on the opposite coast. We\u2019ll usually hang out all three of us like at a movie or my uncle will get tickets for something, but he and John will spend time together too. There\u2019s just this weird vibe between them. Sometimes I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re friends because they don\u2019t like laugh or talk about the good old days with each other, my uncle is kind of uptight around him. They just seem to talk alone a lot.\n\nI\u2019ve also noticed that when we see my grandparents my uncle will never be like \u201coh my friend John is spending the weekend with us.\u201d And this is really embarrassing but John does this thing where he sends out a little email newsletter to my grandparents and older relatives with like pictures and updates, but I\u2019ve noticed John is never mentioned there either.\n\nThe other day I had his phone for something and I noticed a ton of messages between him and John, I didn\u2019t see anything but the last few texts but just noticed the conversation was really large. But then he saw me looking and took his phone back and didn\u2019t say anything. I knew he knew I\u2019d seen it so I said something like \u201cOh it\u2019s cool that you talk, how do you know each other again\u201d and he gave me a vague answer. And I\u2019ve been thinking about it since that happened and realized I don\u2019t even know that much about John. I think he might have a daughter and he\u2019s like showed me some of his hobbies but I don\u2019t know anything about like his life or how he knows my uncle. And like it's weird for him to fly 3k miles multiple times per year to visit in-person, right?\n\nWould it be weird to say something to my uncle? I feel bad and even though we live in a liberal area, our family is semi-religious with lots of older relatives. I feel like I want him to know that I support him specifically. Because sometimes people say they\u2019re fine with LGBTQ people but then they don\u2019t really mean it. And I know it\u2019s his choice but it also kind of bugs me that he doesn\u2019t feel like he can share his own life with me, I\u2019m 17 not 7.\n\n**TL;DR: I think my uncle might be gay.

            "It seems to me that even if your uncle is gay, which IMO is pretty likely but far from certain, that would only be only one aspect of the true answer to the question of \u201cwhat\u2019s the deal with your uncle and John?\u201d Don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but my gut feeling is that if he hasn\u2019t explained whatever is going on with the two of them yet, there\u2019s probably some aspect to it that would be hard to understand for someone who hasn\u2019t experienced adult life, and I would urge you not to push him on it. \n\nHaving said that, it would probably be a good idea to make a point of being supportive of the LBGTQ community to show that you wouldn\u2019t react negatively if someone in your life came out to you.",
            ">And I know it\u2019s his choice but it also kind of bugs me that he doesn\u2019t feel like he can share his own life with me, I\u2019m 17 not 7\n\nSo if he has been raised by religious family, and people can be homophobic without being religious - it's probable that if he is gay he doesn't want to lose his family over it. Also, if he's been raising you alone, he's worried that someone might accuse him of touching you. People love to accuse gay people of being paedophiles. \n\nSo please understand that if he is gay, and that's if, he might feel too much pressure from his whole environment to admit it to anyone, and it's nothing to do with you personally.",
            "I\u2019ve read through your replies here, I think you\u2019re a very kind person who cares about your uncle and wants to share life with your uncle and make sure he feels supported. I would drop little LGBTQ positivity around. Maybe watch that show queer eye in the living room, mention a friend of yours coming out as bi and how it makes you so happy he is living his truth, etc. \n\nAlso, if you\u2019re like me, my family had a hard time sharing anything about dating and relationships. I had a really hard time talking to my parents about my own love life. I\u2019d try to approach your uncle about this and just talk about your own love life. \u201cHey uncle I was thinking about asking this girl to the dance. I think she would like a big gesture, I\u2019m thinking of asking her friends to help me surprise her\u201d or like whatever it is. Involve your uncle as a person you go to for advice or even just as a sounding board for your own problems. This might help break the tension around love and relationships and what you two are comfortable talking about, one day that level of conversation might let him feel comfortable talking to you about that.",
            "As a queer person in a very conservative environment:\n\nDo not bring it up. Do not talk to your uncle or John or anyone else about whether or not they are together. If he wants to tell you, he'll tell you. If you want him to know that you won't be weird about them being together-- which they might or might not be, who knows-- then just drop some pro-LGBT stuff here and there. Talk about supporting an LGBT friend, or liking a queer couple on TV, or whatever. But don't be on the nose about any of it, just keep it on the dl.\n\nGood luck my dude!",

He did the thing where he married a woman as a cover, it didn't work out, and then had a \"roommate\" for the rest of his life.  I knew he was gay but he never \"came out.\"  He just wasn't comfortable with it.  \n\n\nYou can share  your support without having to \"out him\".  Were I you I might say, \"I'm glad you have someone like John in your life.  I hope you know that he can visit any time.  It's nice seeing you happy.\"  \n\n\nThis is pretty similar to how I handled my own uncle a few decades ago.

I just don\u2019t want you to feel like you need to put your dating life on hold because of me\u201d. Or something along those lines to fit your situation. Maybe just throwing it out there in a really casual manner might make him think about it all little",
            "John could be married. If he is, I can see why it would be tense. That would also explain why hey keep it a secret. There really so no way of knowing unless your uncle decides to open up. Maybe tell him you think he\u2019s been a great uncle and you would love him no matter what.",
            "I really don't think this is enough to go on, so I would just let it go. If John was your uncle's partner, it would be weird that he lives so far away and that he wouldn't find someone closer to home. Regardless whether he is gay or not, he is not obligated to tell you anything and if he's gay he may have his own reasons for remaining closeted. If your uncle is gay, I would just wait for him to come out to you. Coming out can be a traumatic experience for LGBT people, so it's best not to just spring it on them unexpectedly. Part of the trauma is the thoughts that people who've known you and claimed to love you your whole life will abandon you when you come out. For me, even though I was fairly sure my parents would be accepting, it was still a traumatic experience because of that. \n\nI would just let it go. If you care about your uncle, just let him know that you care about him. I also would not be one of those people that drop \"hints\" all the time. My dad, bless his heart, did this a lot. Whether it was a gay couple on TV or some news story about LGBT folks, he'd make little comments and go on about how it was okay and he couldn't see what the big deal was. It ended up just being really awkward because I wasn't ready. If your uncle is gay, he should come out on his terms only.",
            "Being non straight carried a huge stigma back when he, and his family members, were young.  Gay men were assumed to pedophiles.  I know several people that were fired for being gay.  It was genuinely horrific.  I am just old enough to have caught the tail end of that.\n\nLet it be.  Also good for him stepping up and being pseudo Dad.",

            "You want your uncle to know you love and support him, but you also feel hurt that he\u2019s not including you in his life. I think it would help to separate these out \u2014 for the first, do your best (a) to be obviously supportive of lgbt+ people around him and (b) to demonstrate that you love and value him. For the second, does he include you in other parts of his life or do you feel like there are a lot of barriers between you? If you feel like there are a lot of barriers, it may be that another barrier is a less fraught one to tackle first. If you feel like this is the one big one, maybe trying to ask him more generally about whether he\u2019s interested in dating will help you connect, even if he doesn\u2019t feel ok with sharing this yet.",
            "My mom knew I was gay for as long as I did, but it was years before I was able to work up the courage to tell her. However, I knew that it would be okay when I did eventually tell her because she used to say things like, \u201cYou know, no matter how you live your life, your father and I will always love you.\u201d \n\nI\u2019d advise that you make it clear that you love him and that you like John, too, and that you want him to live his life in the way that will make him happiest. He may never come out to you, but let him know that if he did, you\u2019d still love him.",
            "I'm an out queer woman who  is adopted by my guardians, so I'm somewhat on the flip side of this equation here! I'm 27 now and I live in a liberal city, but when I came out to my family, they were less than thrilled- and when I brought home a partner some years later, they were still very, very wary and created some real conflicts for me. I cried like you wouldn't believe in those times.   \n\n\nFrom my vantage point, it's important that if your uncle really is gay or LGBTQ+ in any capacity, he has to tell you in his own time. My advice is: don't snoop and try not to pry. While he is your guardian, he is still an adult and he has his own reasons for his secrecy. Respect that. It's never okay to force someone out the closet, even if we have the best intentions and the warmest reception waiting for them on the other side. That said, if you'd like, you can try to find small ways to \"throw it out there\" that you're supportive of LGBT+ rights and would love anyone regardless of their sexual identity. This could include watching a movie with your guardian that has some LGBT+ plot- nothing too graphic or over the top if you don't want, something subtle or family friendly like Love Simon or perhaps a show that just happens to have a LGBT side-character. It could include mentioning something you saw on the news or maybe mentioning a friend or person you know who is LGBT- not just saying \"Oh, I have a gay friend\" or \"there's a gay kid in my math class\" but, if applicable, some comment like: \"One of my friends is thinking about going to prom with his boyfriend\" (if applicable).   \n\n\nThe idea here is just finding soft, subtle ways to signal that you love your uncle and are acceptant of him if he ever chooses to disclose anything with you. Drop your hints, be an ally, and then carry on- I know it's weird and you might have questions for him and others, but I promise you: prying won't help. Some folks never come out- some folks take decades to. Whatever your guardian decides, regard him with the same love he regards you- and don't forget that you're the kid here. You don't have to out-parent your uncle. I wish you both the best!",
            "If your uncle is gay then let him be gay. I don't think there's a need for you to address it. Be supportive by letting him know you appreciate him and care about him. If he opens up about it to you then that's cool. If not, then that's cool too. But you should let that be his decision.",
            "Your Uncle/Guardian may not be ready to admit to even himself that he's gay.  I know that sounds weird, but my brother in law, who was married to my sister, was gay, but never came out to any of us, even when it was painfully obvious to everyone around that him and his partner were a couple.  I mean, you don't have to come out to those you love and those that love you, but it was just awkward pretending that him and his partner were \"friends.\"  To make this whole story even sadder, all this happened after my sister was murdered and he became a single dad to my niece and nephew almost 20 years ago.  We just wanted him to be happy, but I feel like he never admitted to himself that he was gay.  He got cancer in 2014 and passed away soon after.  Life is way too short...",
            "Was your uncle in the military? While yes, he could be gay, I don't see it quite so straightforward as that. \n1) john lives on the opposite coast\n2) john only visits 1-2 times a year\n3) you think he has a daughter (he could even be married\n\nBut if he served with John, they may have a shared painful past. My friend has an infrequently seen friend. They see each other on occasion but only a few of us know how they know each other and why they get together. (Anniversary of the death of a friend who died in service.)\n\nHis private life is private. If he wants to tell you, he will. Whether it's his love life or other reasons for the relationship. Let him maintain his privacy, out of respect. \n\nAlso, single parent here who doesn't date. People make the choices they feel best suit their needs and the needs of their family. I think its sweet that you care about whether raising you has altered the direction of his love life. Sounds like you are close.",
            "So there's two options. Either he's gay or he's not. If he's not, you probably don't want to know what's going on between them. If he is, you don't know his history with your family. You don't know if he tried to come out before or if they talked about gay people being the literal devils. They might have this idea that gay people will corrupt others and since you're still a minor they may say he's done things to you. You also don't know if he's been attacked for being gay on the streets and now is afraid to come out. \n\nThe easiest way to breach the gay topic is a conversation about school and friends. You talk about how you know a lot of people at your school identify as part of the LGBT community and you don't know how to support your school friends. You can ask what he thinks about religion and LGBT people. If he's dismissive I wouldn't say much on top of just saying you're supportive of your friends. If he gets really angry, never speak of that again. Just be really careful if you're in a religious and conservative area. Depending on where you live, even saying you support LGBT people can paint a target on your back.",
            "> And I know it\u2019s his choice but it also kind of bugs me that he doesn\u2019t feel like he can share his own life with me, I\u2019m 17 not 7.\n\nI\u2019m glad to see you have maturity to both recognize this is his choice and your aware that your starting to feel resentment about what feels like a lack of trust. I think a lot of people here have covered why you shouldn\u2019t directly confront him and how you can show your support in other ways. So I would like to touch on that resentment.\n\nI think it may help you to disentangle the idea of your uncle not telling and how much he trusts you with the information. When it comes to him not telling you(if he is gay) it can be for so many reasons unrelated to who you are as a person. It could be that John is the one uncomfortable with sharing and your uncle is respecting his wishes. It be he not telling people is deeply ingrained at this point such that the thought of telling you doesn\u2019t even seem like an option in his head. It could even be he doesn\u2019t want you in the position to have to lie for him to keep it secret.\n\nThe thing about all those reasons is they aren\u2019t about how mature, trustworthy, or accepting *you* are. 7, 17, 27 with kids, it doesn\u2019t matter. It can be easy to attach your Uncle\u2019s opinion of you to if he will tell you this one thing without realizing it. Try and look for other ways your uncle shows he trusts you. Is he willing to give you responsibility around the house? Does he trust your judgment on things? Do you have serious discussions where he respects your opinions and why you think that way? Does he tell you he\u2019s proud of you? All of these are much better ways to gage how much he respects your growth as a person then basing it all on if he shares one specific thing that may or may not be true.\n\nAlso slight aside, it is also possible your uncle is bisexual or some other part of the rainbow that isn\u2019t simply gay. Bi erasure is a real thing and acceptance of straight/gay individuals doesn\u2019t always mean acceptance of other sexualities. This could further complicate ability to be open about it.",
            "Unfortunately we live in a very intolerant world where any non-hetero sexual orientation is seen as a very negative part of person's character worse than dishonesty and unfaithfulness, instead of just being another neutral facet to their identity like their favorite food and has nothing to do with them being a good or bad person in any way.  There are also a lot of people who will say \"I support LGBTQ\" but what they are really saying \"I support LGBTQ as long as its not someone I know\" and if someone they know comes out as gay it will change how they treat that person immediately.  \n\nI know that you may feel like you're not being trusted with something he should trust you with, but both he and John have a lot to lose if the wrong people know.  Just be patient and support your uncle however you can.",

            "I would honestly just start dropping pro-LGBTQ comments so he has confirmation of your beliefs. I\u2019m not sure if you discuss politics, but if you do, that would be a good way to bring it up. You could even do it more subtly and tell a little white lie; mention an anecdote with \u201cmy friend and his boyfriend\u201d. Just drop it into speech to show you are safe and trustworthy. No one has to talk about their sexual orientation if they don\u2019t want to, or even the specifics of a relationship, so I wouldn\u2019t pry. He\u2019ll talk to you if he wants to.",
            "No, like I get where you're coming from, but it isn't really your place or business. Just cos you're pro-LGBT does not mean you can provide the safety or security he might desire to come out (if that's even the case) - there is a vast chasm of difference and responsibility between being cool with something and being able to take on board what could possibly be a lifetime of self hatred and resentment.\n\nAlso I wouldn't take on board the advice about playing queer media around him, if I were in his position there's a chance I'd find it to be mocking behaviour.",

It is extremely likely I will never know.

It would not be appropriate to say even a socially conscious version of, \u201cHEY I SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO ARE GAY ARE YOU GAY?\u201d Which is not only awkward, but also prying into something that he hasn\u2019t made your business yet, not to mention if he wasn\u2019t gay (or if he said no, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily even mean no, but that he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable). Regardless of the answer with something like that, no one is particularly happy. \n\nHonestly, I think the best solution is just to thank him for everything he\u2019s done for you, that you care about him, and that you\u2019re always there for him no matter what. I wouldn\u2019t try to play some game where you try to mention offhand that you love the lgbtq community,  trying to secretly but not so secretly getting him to spills the beans, but instead let your uncle know that you appreciate all he\u2019s done for you and that you are always there if he needs anything. That\u2019s all you\u2019re really trying to say with all of this, right? That you love him and want him to be happy regardless of anything else.

Like it\u2019s not easy to just be like \u201coh cool! Fear is gone!\u201d Because it\u2019s so rooted in him. Like, if you were just told that snakes can\u2019t hurt you, you wouldn\u2019t magically have zero fear around snakes. \n\nHe could also be (maybe irrationally) afraid that if he tells you, then you\u2019ll tell someone else, just because people are generally pretty bad at keeping secrets. So its possible he\u2019s less afraid of *you* judging him but more afraid that if he tells *anyone* then it\u2019s possible that more and more people could find out.

Everyone has their own reality and definition of closeness. As this is my bias on how I perceive your story, you have yours, and your uncle has his.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t dwell much on this. It sounds like you care about him and your relationship with him. What you got there, I think that is special, and that is enough for a lifetime.",
            "You seem like a very kind young man - you're a credit to you and your family and your uncle.\n\nBut *if* (and I'm not saying he is, the only person that knows that is himself) he is bi or gay and in a relationship with a guy, there's something you should know about coming out. \n\nIt's awkward. \n\nEven when you have the best LGBTQ+ supporting family around, it's going to be awkward. And once it starts it never ends - you're continuously coming out, and there's always an element of awkwardness there.\n\nEspecially if you're the kind of person who doesn't like talking about their personal life. There are some kinds of people who just don't like talking about their personal life, and in this heternormative world being that kind of person if you have a same sex relationship can be a bit more difficult. \n\nMy own gut reaction is that your gut reaction about your uncle and John is right. Which is cool. \n\nI think I'd start my echoing some comments here mentioning some things naturally about gay couples  and queer rights in media. \"Oh that's cute, so and so have gotten engaged\", \"Isn't it great that Trump, that homophobic piece of shit, is getting kicked out of office so he can't try and block gay rights\" or if you're watching a show with a Male/Male couple to just announce how great it is to see this happy couple. \n\nOr you can mention gay friends and \"Marc got a boyfriend, I'm happy for him\" kind of thing. \n\nAs I said, you sound like a great young man, but to your Uncle you're just the small child he parented.  You say you're 17, not 7, but your uncle was therefore in his 40's or 30's when he became your guardian. It might take him a while to warm up to coming out to you if he is gay or bi.\n\n If this was an adult relationship where you were friends of the same age, I don't think there'd be as much harm in asking (but even then asking someone in the closet if they are LGBTQ+ can lead to them having a panic response where it feels like the safest thing to say is \"no\") but you are not in that relationship. \n\nHe's someone from an older generation where it would be quite hard to say \"hey I'm not straight btw\". \n\nSo directly asking  \"hey is John your boyfriend?\" might lead to a shutdown on your Uncle's fault, not through any fault of your own. \n\nI'd just through on a few films/TV series that have gay couples. Start with The Birdcage, go with it.  \n\nAnd no matter whether your uncle is straight or bi or gay, he's lucky to have a niece/nephew like you.",
            "He might be gay, he might not be. You can tell him that you love him a lot and are very grateful for the care he gives you.\n\nDepending on your relationship with him you can tell him that you get the feeling he might like John, and that you might be wrong about that but you just wanted to tell him that you'd love him nonetheless.\n\nYou can always drop that you don't understand what the whole fuss is about some people not being straight.",
            "When you see postive things about LGBTQ+ in media , comment positively on it, let him know are you are supportive.\n\nIf you have a close relationship you can always say, you will always love him no matter what.\n\nMaybe in time he will open up, dont push the subject though.",
            "IDK. Maybe he thinks he'll lose custody if one of your other relatives finds out. I'd wait until you have your life decided, whether it's college, trade school, or working.",
            "I think you should follow the other advice here. Start talking about your support for the lgbtq+ community. This week is trans awareness week, so that's a good opportunity! If I were you, I'd become a good ally. Talk about lgbtq issues and how it hurts you to see good people just trying to be happy being disparaged. Find opportunities to bring it up. Go to pride. Make some lgbtq friends online or irl and talk about their lives casually. \"My friend __& got her girlfriend this for their anniversary, isn't that a romantic surprise?\" \"My friend ___ is marrying his boyfriend this summer, would you want to go as my plus one?\" These are just examples. But you get what I mean. \nI've helped my family become more kind to lgbtq folks by being a loud advocate for my friends. And eventually I was able to come out to them as bisexual and hope to feel okay enough to come out to them as non-binary eventually.\n\n\nBe supportive that's all you can do. But if he doesn't come out to you, don't take it personally. He may not even be gay, though i do think with his omissions to your family your suspicions are correct. It's really hard to come out, even to people you love. The fear is overwhelming and I can only imagine it's moreso for those who've lived in the closet their whole lives, old enough to have raised a child to adulthood.\nJust be there. Just love him.",
            "Wow. I wrote a screenplay about this. Umm, in the play the confrontation didn\u2019t work out well but I\u2019m not a good writer so please keep us updated.",
            "Hi,\n\nYou seem like a really good guy that is concerned for your uncle\u2019s happiness, which in this greedy world is great to see!\n\nBut maybe have a conversation with your Uncle and focus just on that?\n\nAs in express to your Uncle how grateful you are that he took you into his house and gave you a home. Explain that now you\u2019re older and more mature you\u2019re starting to feel guilty about the sacrifices he must have made in his work life, social life and indeed love life.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t, and in fairness, probably shouldn\u2019t take the form of a fact finding mission in any way! The reason I say this is that your Unc seems like a quiet, private and compartmentalised person.\n\nPersonally I think this is a good idea because you get the let the guy know that you\u2019re appreciative of the aforementioned sacrifices and he may just start seeing you as this sensible, caring and appreciative young adult. If the only thing achieved by this conversation is that this really great bloke ( from your description!) gets to hear some positive feedback!",
            "I think if he wanted to tell you, he would; however, considering what you have mentioned, your uncle is not interested in doing so. So mind your own business.",
            "You are a lovely person for being so thoughtful. The cool thing here is that there\u2019s nothing placing any urgency on you finding out outside of your own curiosity. My advice would be to keep being so thoughtful and supportive - and hopefully with time it will reveal itself. Good luck friend.",
            "It's very sensitive especially for the older generation. I think he's the kind not to talk about his feelings, and obviously whatever his relationship with John is he likes to keep it very private. Maybe if you have gay friends you can introduce to your uncle that would be a great way to demonstrate how okay with it and supportive you are. As long as it's not taken the wrong way lol",
            "He may not be ready to tell you, and/or he may not want to tell the rest of the family. He may not want you to have to worry about keeping his secret from the rest of the family.\n\nIf you do feel moved to say something, I'd maybe say something he's not obligated to answer, like, \"I don't know exactly what kind of relationship you and John have. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. Just know that I accept both of you no matter what.\" You could write it in a note, too. If your uncle is worried about how you would react that might put his mind at rest.",
            "As others have said, I think having a little rainbow pride flag/button or mentioning supporting a friend who came out is probably all you need to do here. The rest would be up to your uncle.",
            "As somebody who has regularly been accused of being gay by my family, he might just not want to be bothered with dating.\n\nI love the *idea* of a relationship, but if the goal is to get a nut, it's a lot easier to just rub one out.",
            "Go ask uncle Johns man, \nBy the riverside, \nHe\u2019s got some things to talk about, \nHere beside the rising tide",
            "My advice is always to watch a movie or tv show with gay content and express casual approval for what you're seeing.  Find something you both like and have in common, and then say \"You know, it's weird to think this is one of the first portrayals of a gay character in [whatever genre.]  Nowadays it's just so normal, like I have friends at school who are out of the closet, and friends who have gay parents.  I guess I'm pretty young, but it's hard to remember that not long ago at all people wouldn't have been okay with it.\"\n\nThen wait a goodly amount of time and tell him \"You know I love you no matter what, right?\" and give him a hug.  It may still take him some time after that, but all you have to do is lay the groundwork so he knows what your reaction will be and can get used to the idea that he doesn't have to be afraid to come out to you.  \n\nIt may still take some time, but that's about his struggles, not about you.  The kindest thing you can do is not rush him.",
            "You know it could very well be that you uncle fears that he'll lose his guardianship over you if he ever gets outed. \n\nBecause that has happened and could still happen in some places.\nDrop your hints about LGBTQ+ support.. maybe even talk (only if it is true) how much you enjoy it when John is around ... little stuff like that.",
            "Are you graduating from high school soon? Write him a nice card thanking him for everything he\u2019s done for you and let him know he\u2019s the best man and role model you know and there is nothing that would ever make you feel any differently.",
            "As an LGBTQ person... if I were in your shoes I'd probably try wearing a pride pin, like a pin with the lgbt plan, subtle, but I think he'd notice something that, we do notice people with them",
            "Don't push any issues, it sounds complicated at the least. I'd just say something like, \" I love you unconditionally, and I appreciate you always being there for me and want you to know that I will always be there for you no matter what too\" In addition to that direct assurance of love and support maybe at a slightly different time bring up the LGBTQ community and how you support them. Don't push it though, if he is gay, and if he is not comfortable sharing, then that is his choice and you shouldn't feel hold it against him, it can be really hard for people to come out and thats a super personal choice.",
            "It's really sweet that you want to let him know you support him if it's true. As another commenter said, gay rights and cultural acceptance today is lightyears away from where it was not so long ago. When I was your age, the Supreme Court had JUST overturned a ban on gay sex. I'm only in my early 30s. \n\nTry to imagine if you loved someone, and it was literally illegal to be with them. I'm still not out to my family because I know some would treat me differently. If your uncle is gay, or bi, or something else, he spent most of his life in fear of what would happen if someone found out about him. He might want to tell you, but it feels safer to hide himself than to risk losing you if you would reject him. \n\nDo you have any LGBTQ friends? Is there a Gay-Straight Alliance club at school you could join? Maybe you could make a point to comment on a real life situation you hear about, either locally or on the national news. Like, \"I heard that the new Supreme Court justice would vote to make gay marriage illegal. That's horrible. Everyone deserves to be happy.\" Or, \"Brian got bullied at school because he's gay. We're going to the school board meeting to speak out. He's my friend and there's nothing wrong with being gay.\" \n\nI wouldn't want someone to flat out ask me if I'm queer, but I might be inclined to come out if they demonstrated being accepting.",
            "Just, just keep you nose out of it and mind your own business? Give your uncle a break and let him do what he wants bro.",
            "In a similar situation, with someone younger than me in my family, I made sure he heard me talking about gay issues in order to create a safe space. Eventually, I really was the first person he came out to. So I think you should do the same: make sure you casually mention LGBT issues next to him, so he knows you're open - he might come to you on his own. Good luck!",
            "I see a lot of fair answers. A question you could ask without being direct with him, that would show at least his point of view on the whole matter, whether he\u2019s gay or bi or pan or not, is maybe make it a context at school.\n\n\u00ab\u00a0 Hey uncle, there\u2019s a student I know well that other kids say may be LGBTQ, I don\u2019t want to assume, but is there any way I can show support? Even if it\u2019s just in general? Like to be someone they can be themselves with?\u00a0\u00bb\n\n   It doesn\u2019t have to be true or accurate. You show you care. If it technically happened to a student, I\u2019d just tell them if they want to talk I\u2019m open to listen whether they are lgbtq or not (people can be bullies and spread rumours too). You uncle\u2019s answer may not be perfect either, but just showing some compassion and open-mindedness would make him proud.",
            "I\u2019m going to start with assuming that you\u2019re ok with him being gay.\n\nI\u2019d start reaffirming that he\u2019s your dad, he is probably the only father you\u2019ll ever have.\n\nThen follow up with asking him outright, let him know in advance that you want to talk about something important so that it\u2019s not a surprise. Then if he says yes then continue with point no1.\n\nIf he says no, leave it, he\u2019s entitled to a life.",
            "In my experience, don\u2019t worry about his relationship with this guy. It\u2019s his to manage. \n\nFor your part, just be kind, compassionate and nonjudgemental with your speech/actions. Feel free to speak up about your support for LBGTQ in a non-personal way. He\u2019ll need to come out in his own time. All you have to do is love him as a person until he does.",
            "You could simply talk to him about whether he'd like to date generally, and not make the assumption what gender he'd prefer: \"Hey, it occurred to me lately that I've not seen you date someone for a while. If there's any part of that to do with me, I just want you to know that I'd be totally comfortable meeting a girlfriend or boyfriend of yours.\"",
            "If he is gay, it may not be that he doesn't trust you, it may be that he isn't comfortable with himself yet. Sometimes it can be a second nature to hide things like that from people. Maybe one day he will feel like telling you, if that is the case, but don't feel like he doesn't trust you with it. If he's known this about himself for a while, a lot of people have something called \"internalized homophobia\" whether they realize it's there or not. This can hold you back from being yourself for a long time. Maybe he's denying this fact about himself and doesn't want people to think bad of him. There are a lot of reasons he may not want to tell you, if that is what is going on. Don't be so hard on yourself."

The major consensus was that I was NOT over-reacting (I really didn't think I was either!!) and that Ali's behaviour was not cool.\n\nSo, Rick and I were hanging out last night, and I took the advice of /u/cold08 and, at a suitable time, asked him how HE feels when Ali's sitting on his lap, etc. and if he would feel comfortable telling me what's going on in his head at those times. He told me (exasperatedly) that nothing goes on in his head since they are just friends and he doesn't know what else to tell me (shocker). I mentioned that I had made this post. He asked to see it. I thought it might make him see things more clearly, that her behaviour is inappropriate, but he actually got angry...(we've never really fought before). \n\nI think he was upset because he knew he was wrong. But basically he was like \"so, what now? I can't be friends with her anymore? I can't have any female friends because you're threatened?\" I explained I'm not threatened persay, and I would never ask him to de-friend anyone, but I feel disrespected when she does these things and asked if he'd be willing to ask her to back down a bit. \n\nWell, he broke down and told me that he had lied to me. They have slept together before (numerous times, mostly while drunk at parties, etc). And there are underlying feelings (SHOCKER). He says he doesn't have them for her, but she's expressed hers to him before. He says he isn't interested in pursuing a relationship with her at all, but she does get jealous and tries to mark her territory. Apparently, this has caused issues in previous relationships (on both sides) and he DOES know it's a problem. But he does not want to hurt her feelings because she's sensitive (the fuck?).\n\nBasically, I broke up with him after that. Not only was I PISSED that he blatantly lied to my face about anything happening between them, but he put her before me anyways by refusing to cut back her inappropriate behaviour or telling her to stop. And I don't think he ever would've put me first anyways. I told him I refuse to be anyone's second choice, and did not want be put in between this drama. I also told him he needs to figure his shit out otherwise he's going to fuck up every good relationship he has. He tried to beg me not to go, but fuck that shit. \n\nI'm sad, I'm angry, I'm SO PISSED OFF and seriously want to go punch this stupid bitch in the face, and maybe kick him in balls too, but, since life doesn't work that way, here I am. 7 months wasted, but lesson learned. I'm going to my friend's for wine night tonight, and I'm going to have a good fucking time. I'm annoyed that she \"wins\" in a way now, but, I deserve better so...bye felicia.\n\nThanks again to everyone for their advice, it's much appreciated and made me realize a lot of things I didn't see. So thank you for that :)\n\n**tl;dr**: (Ex) boyfriend was a liar, and was never going to put me first. So I dumped him and I'm better off. You guys were right, thanks Reddit!",

That would be bad enough, but throw in the details that he was in a relationship while this occurred, which he actively participated in disrespecting. Yeah, I agree with the other commenter.

And he already knows that he doesn't win, because she sucks. And no matter what they do or where they go, who they are and how they treat people is why they can't have happiness.

You called it all out, put it out there, and then walked out on his ass. THEN he tried to beg you not to go and you reaffirmed that not only are you not coming back, but it's because of his relationship with her, her disrespect, and his disrespect to you. You pointed out that it is HER behavior that is the problem, and his acceptance of it nailed it in. \n\nYou also warned him that she will continue to fuck up his relationships in the future if he doesn't pull his idiot head out of his ass.\n\nRegardless of whether he wants to or not, he will remember this because *he didn't want you to break up with him*. \n\nThis will cause him to think of it, even if only once, and be reminded of that when he looks at her. \n\nMaybe they'll get together (frankly they deserve each other, fucking douche bags), maybe not.

There's a bond and a deep trust that comes along with time that just can't be replicated. \nSo breaking up is probably your best bet, but I think it's undoubtedly feasible you two could make things work If you really wanted to, but that's your decision ultimately.

            "Yeah, this is just a cat and mouse game between the two of them. Unfortunately   you were just an interesting complication in their shitty game. They both suck. And no person should put up with that kind of behavior. I don't know many committed men that would be have this way. ",
            "God, we doesn't he just date her? They've been together for awhile now anyway.",
            "Go girl!",
            "Congrats! The relationship was going to get worse and worse anyways if his personality is so deceptive",
            "You win. He's not going to date her. You're going to move on and find a way better guy, and you'll always be his number one. ",
            "You deserve much better. Just saying. ",
            "[joke] So... I hear you're single... :-p [/joke]\n\nEnjoy it, and find someone worthwhile when you're ready.",
            "GO OP, you rock!",
            "You deserve better than a dumb schmuck like him anyway. And you're completely right that his idiocy with her is going to fuck up every good relationship he'll ever have. If he can't see that, it's on him.\n\nGood luck in the future, hon! You're a smart, capable, badass woman and you'll be just fine!",
            "fuck him, I'm pissed along with ya",
            "Felicia doesn't win at all. Look at it in a way where she is fighting for someone that can't tell a girl off to save his relationship. This is the man she is fighting for. Let them have each other. You win by figuring out how spineless your ex is and getting away from all this drama.",
            "He's a fucking dick, I hope he read this. Idiot.",
            "Good job OP! You are so young, and handled this so well. Good for you! Let her keep him. ",

            "> He says he isn't interested in pursuing a relationship with her at all, .... But he does not want to hurt her feelings because she's sensitive.\n\nGet him to read this... he's contradicting himself and just making himself look more like an asshole that he already is.  He likes her she likes him but they know if they're together the chemistry and attraction wouldn't sustain one.",

            "I'm not saying you were wrong. I'd be pissed about the lying too. I just don't think you handled it as well as you could have, and now she gets exactly what she wanted. Good job, OP, you fell into that trap nicely.\n\nNot like it's a huge loss for you though. It seems like this guy wasn't worth it anyway.\n",

            "I don't  know... I feel like you broke up a step too soon.  It sounds like he didn't know how to stop the behavior when you broke up and there was a chance to tell him that he needs to tell her what boundaries are to fix this.  If this has been an issue in previous relationships and he didn't just go start dating this girl, then he may want to stop it, but just lacks the balls for it.",
