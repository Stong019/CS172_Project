            "It sounds like she senses you\u2019re just keeping her around as a security blanket and she knows the relationship has run its course. Don\u2019t waste her time if you\u2019re one foot out the door.",
            "27 years old and 3 years of dating is a pretty common \"move forward or end it\" step. You have no desire to move forward and she does. So, yeah, seems like it's over.\n\nYou react by letting it happen. Do you even love her? You describe her as a security blanket and mommy (with insufficient bang) essentially. She deserves better than that. If you don't love her, want to marry her, then let her go. Nobody deserves to be kept around because it's better than you being alone.\n\nAlso, if she's constantly having to emotionally support you and you treat her as your security blanket, that could easily be the explanation for your faltering sex life. On top of knowing you don't have any particularly strong future goals with her.",
            "Tbh, from what you said, it sounds like your girlfriend would be correct in wanting to separate and I think you probably know that it isn't lining up correctly for you either. It does honestly seem like you're taking more from her then you're able to give because you struggle with mental health (which isn't your fault so please don't misunderstand at all, but she has to take care of her needs too). But this is just my interpretation of your post, I could be misunderstanding things too and you know your situation much better than an outsider who read a few paragraphs about it.\n\nAnyway, supporting someone else while only getting a reserved amount in return eats away at a person after a while, if she's getting bitter toward the situation then that'll only make you both miserable so the kindest thing for both of you would be to part ways I think. It seems like you need to keep working on self-love and your own journey to feeling safe and ok in yourself while she needs to find someone who is ready to give the same amount she is in the relationship so that she can feel supported and valued, not just like someone else's safety net. I wouldn't like to feel that way in a relationship if I was her and you don't seem like a bad person or anything so I doubt you'd want to make someone feel that way either.\n\nAnyway you should just be honest I think and say that yes, your mom mentioned it when the subject comes up once you're done with holiday. It seems like everyone is trying to avoid confrontation because it's uncomfortable but breakups are a confrontation by their nature, regardless of whether it ends on good or bad terms. No one has anything they should feel bad about in the situation, not you, not your mom, and not her (other than the grief and disruption that comes with breaking up). You two are just different people with different needs, even if you love one another. And your mom was just put in a situation she shouldn't have been, that was a mistake on your girlfriend 's part (she's human though and people make mistakes). Anyway try not to forget that a lot of great things happen with breakups too, like excitement, time for hobbies and friends, and personal growth.\n\nBest of luck and sorry for the essay!!",
            "If you're depressed and unstable without her, you're actually depressed and unstable *with* her and the good feelings she gives you mask the depression.\n\nI can't imagine she would tell this to your mother and expect her not to tell you. She was probably hoping that your mom would tell you.\n\nYou write like you can't live without her yet you say you aren't ready for marriage after 3 years and that's fine but you can't expect her to wait forever. It's nice for you to have that \"safety\" but it's not her responsibility.\n\nJust ask your gf about it. Maybe it'll lead to a meaningful conversation that will strenghten your relationship or end it. One way or the other, it needs to be had and you need to be in therapy. And if you are, maybe you aren't listening to your therapist.",

It may well be that your girlfriend was feeling sad that she can't relate to you as well as she once did, but is not planning to dump you.  Perhaps your depression is more debilitating in a relationship than you are aware of (sometimes depressed people think it is themselves who are feeling down, when in fact it's all one's close associates too).  If there is true affection, couples counseling might be indicated.  So maybe you need to work harder to keep this relationship healthy, but you really don't know until you get back and talk to her.\n\nI wouldn't keep the broken confidence by your mother to yourself.  Admit that the girlfriend's remark got repeated, and gave you a lot to think about.  And think you did!  This could be the occasion for a healthy boost between you and your girlfriend.",

Get therapy or therapy from friends & family who offer it. She's been your therapy & she's all out. I've seen people come and go from this life because they didn't force themselves to get up every morning. You have to really WANT to get better, in order to get better.

            "The reality is, breakups tend to suck, and they tend to hurt, even when they're 100% necessary. You were thinking of ending it, she was thinking of ending it, and from what you said, it's for the best. You can't depend on her to keep you afloat emotionally, that's way too much responsibility for your partner, especially if you don't really love her or want to marry her. \n\nPrepare for the breakup, find a therapist, learn to manage your depression on your own so you won't depend on the next partner who comes along. Get yourself to a point where you're in a relationship because you love the *person* you're with, and not just addicted to the security of the relationship.",

This is not the best reason to be with someone:\n\n>But, and this is selfish, I have never felt safer than with her. She cuddles  \n me and strokes my head and tells me she loves and believes in me. She   \nhelps me improve and wants me to be better than I already am.\n\nOn the surface, it sounds wonderful. She has supported you, and you love being supported. However, in a situation where you mismatch in other very important ways, you're letting her emotional care for your own insecurities get in the way of your need for a partner that is more satisfying sexually and that has a timeline for proposal similar to your own. It's possible she senses that incompatibility too. \n\nI also wonder what prospects for other forms of emotional care you have. What is your support network? Usually people have at least a few of the following, which can help them: \n\n* Family (you seem close to yours)\n* Friends, including close friends you can talk to about issues like this\n* Activities you enjoy doing with others\n* Activities you enjoy doing alone that help center you\n* Mentors through school, work, or community life\n* Some kind of civic or organizational involvement\n* A therapist, counselor, or coach (is your depression diagnosed? is it being treated?)\n\nI point all of these out because it's easy to let a relationship be our primary support network, and people often have trouble seeing how they get affirmation outside of a relationship. Obviously partners are an important source of affirmation and support for many people, but if we don't also have other places for emotional support, then it may put stress on the relationship, make you overlook other important aspects to a relationship, or (as here) make breakups harder. \n\nSo my suggestion is to ask her directly about this statement and affirm the breakup. Then work on your support network, with the goal of diversifying your emotional support basket.  I know that isn't easy with depression, but every proactive step - every meeting you plan with a friend, every activity you attend, every session you show up to - is a boon. Eventually, someday, in a future relationship, your goal is to have someone sexually satisfying, compatible in terms of relationship trajectory, and *supportive* without being your only support.",
            "It's understandable that if, after three years, you are not progressing the relationship to a proposal, she would want out.

You can't expect her to wait around indefinitely.  As the saying goes, \"Shit or get off the pot.\"  She gave it three years.",

To do this is scary as it should be. It is scary to risk failure for what you really want. \n\nSit down with your therapist and start talking about what you want for yourself out of your life. Depression is a symptom of being unfulfilled, and often of having some kinds of trauma, family dysfunction or a series of losses or things that did not pan out. It\u2019s not depression that needs to be overcome - what needs to be adddesssed are the actions, thoughts, wounds and emotions that are tied up and causing the fear of becoming your full self. \n\nYour gf may or may not stay to see that through.

She's essentially mothering you. Which is not at all sexy. \n\nYou need to learn to be that comforting voice for yourself. Or hell, just hire someone to cuddle you and encourage you.

You're facing the consequences of externalizing your coping mechanisms now-- you can't grasp going back to being alone because someone else, who has the right to define their own future and whether or not you're in it regardless of what would be ideal for you, is doing whats best for them. You have to find a way to build up that security in yourself. And if I could do it, someone who has literally been depressed for as long as I can remember, you can too. You need to find that security and love for you within yourself. You won't give her what she yearns for, which isn't your fault, but sometimes people are just too different for things to work. That's why you need to become your own security, because it is extremely rare for two people to fit each other like gloves.\n\nFind a therapist you like, one you feel comfortable with, one that can relate to you. They will be able to lead you where you're looking to go. They will teach you how to find that security.

Whether you need to stop talking until you both heal...\n\nAnd, address it, proactively. Don't be waiting for her to break it to you.

            "Like most people have been pointing out, it seems like you are using her as a \"security blanket\" to help cope with depression. \n\nTrust me this is not sustainable and not worth her time or your time. \n\nI myself have recently gotten out of a relationship that wasn't good for either of us but I stayed and was using it as a way to feel \"safe\" with my own problems. Once I began to realize that, I knew the relationship wasn't working but the only thing keeping me there was the safety. So I broke it off and trust me it sucked hard. I felt lost and totally did not know what to do. I'm finally coming out of that fog and feel I am becoming better at battling my problems because now I don't have that crutch, I NEED to deal with it. \n\nI think in the grand scheme of your life this may be the best thing that happens to you. I know it doesn't feel like it, but trust me, as long as you work hard to improve yourself once the break up happens, you will feel good about yourself and your life.",
            "First and foremost.  You need to make sure you have a support system.  Depression is not a joke, and with the situation you are currently in, you need to make sure you have the ability to stay out of a low.  Maybe call your doctor, psychiatrist etc. give them a low down of what you are worried about, and prepare accordingly.   Next, I don\u2019t know if you provided her with the same security, either way, I don\u2019t know your relationship well enough to say you are using her. I do know this though, you obsessing over the situation is not going to help it I\u2019m anyway.  If you can get passed it, make the phone call.  You don\u2019t need to say your mother said something, you can just call and bring up your own thoughts. Hell, if you are completely honest things could be saved.  Idk.  If she is hanging on till you get back, she is probably torturing herself as well.  Before you do so, make sure you spend the time to go over how the conversation might play out.  Look in the mirror, go over the hard questions, and make sure you tell yourself over and over again what your expectations from the conversation are.  Then stick to those. Also go over what you expect and don\u2019t expect on her end.\n\nThe other possibility in this situation is she said something to your mom, to give you a heads up.  Maybe even to spark what I\u2019m saying to you.  \n\nOnce again, make sure you prioritize your emotional stability above all.  I suffer with depression as well.  I find it gives me strength to sit and stew, obsess, and generally beat the crap out of myself internally for one day after breaking up.  Then the next I spend all day physically exhausting myself.  Hiking, running, lifting, swimming, and smoking green and popping and Advil right before I fall asleep.  Then the next day I push harder, hard enough for the physical pain to overwhelm the emotional pain. Takes me a few days, but my routine works.  Take care and good luck.",
            "Safety isn't life. Exploration is. If you've got depression, work on that. You're literally letting it keep you in a miserable relationship.",
            "I study psychology and was in a similar situation where I was with a long term partner and we talked about our futures together and marriage but he never seemed to be actually committed. I feel like you taking an extra week to yourself may have impacted her in a way. While it's understandable that you might want some time alone, it would seem rather strange to her and she might feel left out and like you don't actually care. Have the two of you been keeping in touch while you're away? Maybe it's just me and my ideals of traveling and spending time with a partner but I'm just giving you my two cents on what might be going on in her mind. I think you should also get into some therapy. It doesn't seem like your parents really know how to set or respect the boundaries. Yes - your parents may have not known how to deal with it themselves when they got the news and panicked to tell you. Did they elaborate on why she even expressed breaking up? Also what.. why were YOU considering breaking up with her? Or is this some sort of justification you're coming up with to not feel so hurt? \"I was planning to dump her anyways.\" Just come to terms with it and be mature is all I can say. You two grew apart and the sex is declining (tbh if you actually love her, that wouldn't be an issue, since it can be rekindled if you work at it). Don't explode. Don't say snide remarks like \"I knew you were going to dump me\". So far she thinks it won't work between the two of you and you're not even going to figure out why? This could still be saved if you want to save it and put some work into the relationship. \n\nAnyways this is what you can do - pretend you didn't hear it from your parents and try to improve the relationship (if you still want to keep it) or wait till she breaks up with you and take it maturely. How? Just say that you have been feeling the same way and it sucks it didn't work out but that you have enjoyed the time you've spent together.",

            "Hi OP, I also am a monopolar depressive.  I hope you don't mind if I offer advice from my point of view.\n\nYou're young.  It seems like you're into exploring and not quite into settling down - there's nothing wrong with that.  But part of you wants to feel safe.  Hence, you're staying with your gf for those areas.  Yet, another part of you understands that you're not getting enough out of this relationship.\n\nI'll probably get downvoted, but there's nothing wrong with dating more people until you find someone who's compatible with you in ways that you can be with for a long time.  It's ok to realize that aspects of your relationship are what you'd like in a marriage (the kindness and affection), and aspects of it are not (the mismatched sex drives).  This is growth and maturity.\n\nYour current girlfriend might only be able to give you part of what you need.  It's ok to break up for that and ok to look for someone closer to fitting you better.  It's even ok to think \"wow, she really does it for me in the cuddling department\" while admitting she can't in other ways.\n\nDon't force a relationship and don't think that marriage and children will fix problems.  I'd suggest that if both you and your gf think that it's best if you break up, then break up.  Now you know more about yourself and your needs.  You'll bring that maturity to your next girlfriend.  Be choosey!  Don't just date anyone.  Find someone who matches with you, now that you know what you need.",

            "Ehm, I don't see any other mentioning it, so can we talk about how sort of really kinda a lot weird it is to take another week of vacation when all the other people on the vacation (Mom and partner, atleast, who else) leaves? This is just so weird ... like ... it screams you want to experience the place more than you want to experience the place \\*with people you love\\*, and \\*create memories together\\*.\n\nI think this action is quite symptomatic of how you see her place in your life. She is nice to keep around when things are bad, but if things are good and you are doing interesting things (like visiting a country you really love), you don't need her, and are perfectly good on your own. The fact it does not sour your experience that your partner said no to joining is very, very telling.\n\nCaveat: this mostly applies because you already went on vacation together and you decided to stay, alone. If you both decided you wanted different types of vacations and locations from the get go, and took separate holidays, that's a different situation, but that's not what's happening here.",

            "She's probably leaving because you haven't popped the question yet. Unless she gave your mother some other reason, or you really think there is another reason. If she loves you and takes care of you, and believes in you and has expressed a desire to make a life with you, then she loves you enough to marry you. She just doesn't think you're ever going to ask because it's already been 3 years. And frankly she's being smart about that. \n\nRegarding the sex, you're going to go through periods in your relationship where you have less sex than other periods in your relationship. It happens in every long-term relationship and marriage. You might be dry for a few months, and then you might have sex everyday for a few months. That's just the normal ebb and flow. \n\nHave you discussed a future together at all? Have you discussed having children? Buying a home? What's your career goals are? Of course these are all things you'll need to discuss before you decide to get married. The lack of discussion on these topics is the only thing that I personally consider makes someone of age not ready for marriage. Did she give any reasons related to these types of life plans that calls her to think you're incompatible? \n\nSo, in summation, unless she told your mother that she didn't think it was working for some other specific reason, then truly it's probably because she doesn't think you're going to marry her- and well you know, tick tock. In fact, she might have told your mother before she told you in order to prompt your mother to talk some sense into you. So I would explore that before I determine that everything is lost.

        "selftext": "[Orignal Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4sl27b/my_husband_34m_bought_a_house_without_telling_me/)\n\nI have what I consider to be a pretty happy update, but considering how many people would calling for me to divorce my husband in the last post, maybe you guys won't feel the same. \n\nWe sat down and had long talk last night and again this morning.\nI told my husband, in no uncertain terms, that this had been a huge breach of trust and I was in no way happy with the fact that he bought this house. I had called my parents before and figured out how much it cost them to renovate a lot of the rooms in their house, as well as how long they estimated it took. I showed him those numbers and I could tell that that made it really sink in just how much work he had signed himself up for.\n\nAll of this finally sobered him up and he apologized for doing this. He said he understands why I didn't want it, and he understood that I wanted no part in the renovations, but he still loves this house and thinks he can renovate it to the point that I will love it, too. And to be fair to him, the house does have nice bones. It's in a good area, and the idea of being able to hand-pick everything and change a few things around to exactly what we want does appeal to me a *little* bit. So I agreed to keep the house.\n\nWith that decision, though, comes the condition that he will be doing *all* the renovations by himself. It will come from his pocket, he will do all the work, deal with hiring any contractors needed, everything. We agreed on a few major things that need to be done by the end of this year to make the house livable without it being a total construction zone. The only involvement I will have in the renovations will be input on paint colors, flooring, and fixtures. If he has the major projects we agreed on done by the end of the year, we will move in and I have agreed that I will help a little, but the house will not take up all of our free time. As soon as it does, I am done. \n\nIn the meantime, we will be keeping the apartment. That is where we'll be living for the rest of this year. We agreed on a maximum amount that either of us can spend without consulting the other person. He has agreed to go to marital counseling with me so that we can figure out a better way to communicate so that this never happens again.\n\nAll in all, I'm pretty happy with it. I'm still kind of pissed at him and won't be lovey-dovey for a quite a while, but I can be in the same room as him without wanting to snap his head off. He's still my husband and I still love him. Hopefully in 20 years this will just be something that makes me roll my eyes when I remember it. I'm not looking forward to the coming months of renovations, but I'm glad that I don't have to be a part of it. He can spend his weekends ripping up carpet and insulating walls. I'll be in the San Juan Islands whale-watching and getting drunk on vineyard tours. \n\nThanks to everyone for your help.\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: We're keeping the house and have some new \"rules\" to assure that this doesn't happen again. Not looking forward to renovations, but I don't have to do any of it so I think this is the best compromise. ",

That will be the final proof to him that it is ok for him to make decisions like this without you, he won't really need to consider your opinion or give you a say in mayor decisions, because you'll come around to his way of thinking.

I've also done bathroom remodels, tile work etc. \n\nI mean, it sounds like he didn't even have a clue on his budget for this or what would be involved(I have $20K in tools in one work vehicle) so it sounds like he has maybe watched a few HGTV/DIY shows and thought it would be cool. These things typically go one of two ways, the person with no experience spends 2 years on a 4-5month project, does a terrible job or they just don't get it done at all. The better outcome is that they realize a month in they have no clue what they are doing and that watching YouTube videos is not actually the same as using an experienced contractor and they cave and hire one but since they didn't have a real budget they spend way more money then they anticipated. If he's replacing electrical panels that's supposed to be permitted and inspected, replacing HVAC permitted and inspected, new plumbing permitted and inspected. Is he moving walls, are they load bearing, does he know the difference?\n\nIt's just always sort of shocking to me how people have arrived at this idea that they can just do a full remodel with no experience, if you've ever watched Holmes on Homes when he goes in and finds just a total botch job or a partially finished job from a long time ago and makes it all right, that's how these often turn out.",

And to the feminists on reddit, it's not that I think since she makes less than me she's less of a person -- It's that on paper, I work my ass off. 90 - 100 hours per week, run multiple companies if I want a toy, I'm getting it (it's THAT simple).

I had no idea so many people would care so much about clay, I thought I would get like two comments. This really blew up. Thank you to everyone who commented, to all the people who told me how the process works, and for all of the general tips regarding clay, student financial aid, and general finances. A lot of people took time to read my stupid ramblings and type up a reply. I'm grateful. \n\nI also want to thank every single one of you who offered to buy me clay. You are all the kindest, most generous people ever. I just wouldn't feel right taking money to buy clay, when I don't even enjoy the medium. I also will go into more details below, but I'm not going to be taking the class anymore. \n\nTo all of you who agreed with Mary and said that I'm not an adult because:\n\n1. I don't have $10\n2. I wasn't prepared coming to class (Gosh, if only I was psychic and knew my clay hardened)\n3. I cried when someone yelled at me for not having money\n4. I'm lying about not having any money, and I just wanted to be a bitch to my teacher\n\nI would like to say that I'm glad none of you has ever been in this situation before. I put it clearly in my post (and my replies) that I didn't have $10 that day. I have money now! Fiance got paid, we're fluuuuuuuuuush with cash! I mean not really, but still. We're good! If I wanted to buy a shit ton of clay right now, I could. It just so happened that I ran out of money after paying the bills in the middle of the month, and I didn't see how it was a big deal because I wasn't expecting any purchases. It was probably a period of 3 or 4 days where I was OUT of money, and at that point it's easy to just hold out until one of us gets paid. I have an apartment, a computer, my bills are paid and I have food. I would say I am adulting, just by definition. For everyone telling me I need to sort that out, I AM. FFS I AM. Fiance got a better job, I'm looking for a better job. I KNOW I'M NOT IN THE BEST SITUATION, I'M WORKING TO FIX IT. JEEZ. \n\nFor the clay, I stored it in my locker the entire semester with no problems so far. The outside would maybe be a little stiff, but being new to clay (at least, new to fancy high-fire sculpting clay), I thought it was normal. I would just spray it and squish it until it was manageable. This was the first time the entire block felt like a rock, and I couldn't move much of the clay. I didn't know what the procedure was here, so to all of you saying that it's easy to google and find out, guess who doesn't like phones in her class? Also, why would I google it when I have a supposed clay expert two feet from me? I picked up my bag, felt the clay, and asked Mary for help because my clay was hard. That was it. I didn't say, \"Mary. My clay is ruined. Get me new clay or I'm not participating in your stupid class.\" I also wasn't taking her away from her lesson, because she had just finished demonstrating something. People were picking up their clay and getting started on the assignment, so I wasn't taking her away from my other classmates and I certainly wasn't disturbing anyone. According to many of the ceramicists(?) here on reddit, hard clay is an easy fix. She could have showed me how to fix the clay. She could have TOLD me how to fix the clay, and left me to do it on my own. She could have told me that without clay, I can't participate and my grade will be docked. She could have simply said, \"Can you go get more clay?\" And I would have probably said \"Not today, but if you want I can model for my partner today and I'll have clay on Thursday.\"\n\nSo on to the update. I spoke to my other trusted teacher, who happens to be the chair of my major's department. I came up to him and said, \"I know it's not YOUR department, but as a department chair, I was wondering if I could get your advice. It's about a teacher.\" And he just gestured me outside to where we could talk. At first I tried to be vague, and not single out who the teacher was since it's not his department, but I was struggling with what I was trying to say. He asked me to tell him who it was and what happened, so I did. I teared up a little bit, felt stupid, but he totally validated my feelings. He said she was unprofessional and classless, that she should NOT have done what she did. He said I confirmed what he already thought of the teacher. He also told me (he used to go to school for ceramics) that she is not even using the right clay for figure sculpture. She's using ceramics clay, and it isn't necessary or easy when it comes to sculpting people.\n\nI asked what I should do, because it's his certificate I'm taking the class for. He told me we would find some other alternative for those credits, or I could wait it out until the department takes the class from her and gives it to someone who deserves it. He advised that I should drop the class, because as a teacher, you start to be in danger when your enrollment drops. You get looked at, you get questioned, evaluated. He basically said, fuck her. If she's going to be that unstable and treat me like that, she doesn't deserve to have me in her classroom. She thinks she's teaching us some big life lesson when she gets mad about a late student, or when she yells at us about having hard clay, but she forgets where she is. A community college. We're there to learn, to try and better ourselves, and we're doing it despite being in a worse-off financial position. I shouldn't let someone like her discourage me from getting a certificate or a degree. So I asked if a complaint would make any sort of difference, and he just said it wouldn't. Unless there are a thousand complaints, then nothing will be done. Her file will be flagged, but unless it's a pattern, then she won't be fired. Being new to the class, however, might get through enough to where they take the class from her. He also told me that if he hears any other student having problems with her class like this, he will take it off of his certificate and replace it with something else. This would hurt her, because over half of those students were in there because of the same certificate I was. \n\nWhen I got home, I got an email from her. It said: \n\n\"Teacherthrowaway1313\n\nI am so sorry if I embarrassed you in front of the class. Please accept my apology\"\n\nHeartfelt, right?\n\nSo basically I'm writing a letter to the dean and dropping the class. I know a lot of you said how it would be cowardly of me, how I should walk back in with my head held high, and pretend that she can't hurt me, but this was the final straw. I was not learning anything from her class. When it started, I was really excited to learn how to work in clay and how to make little sculptures, to learn about more sculptors and their techniques, and none of that has happened. The only reason I was there was a certificate, and if I don't have to go back, I don't want to waste my time on her. I can spend my time focusing on my other classes and looking for a better job ;) I've been working on standing up for myself more (my roommate's friends wanted to crash on my couch for a few days, which of course turned into wanting to stay for a few months, and I shut that down before he was even done talking. Set boundaries, set expectations. Felt like a bitch, but a boss ass bitch). You win some, you lose some. Next time someone starts to yell in my face, hopefully I won't turn red and stutter apologies. Let them know it's not okay to talk to me like that, and give them a chance to correct themselves. But this time, I feel better just leaving it behind me. Thanks for your help, /r/relationships, you guys are cool :)\n\nTLDR: Writing a letter to the dean, dropping the class. Finding alternative credits for my certificate, don't have to deal with Ms. Crazypants anymore. Also, am now flush with cash. ",

Your \"honor\" or \"manliness\" or \"bravery\" or whatever the hell people are trying to suggest you defend -- is NOT WORTH wasting your time or money on. \n\nYou could be sitting in a class with an actually qualified teacher, learning actual skills, enjoying your day.

Also, if it was just that you were out of cash at this particular point in time, you really shouldn't try to get by with the bare minimum.

            "Hey, I just want to tell you that I was once an art student who had a horrendous clay instructor.  He was a revolting turd.  A group of us complained and went up the chain.  I found out he had to go to sensitivity training or something.  Good though it probably didn't do much to change him.   \n\nAnyway, I got a masters in teaching and now teach art in an elementary school.  I can't tell you how many parents/fellow teachers tell me horrible tales about an art teacher who was cruel to them.  This makes me super pissed.  Art is such a personal thing.  Art teachers should be sensitive, thoughtful, and caring.  And any good art teacher creates that kind of atmosphere in the class.  How can people feel comfortable expressing themselves and working through problems if they are being judged and treated like a sub human?  Sadly I have had several nasty college art professors.  Remember that she has the problem not you.  I don't want to make blanket statements but there are a lot of \"art people\" who think they are the shit and then guess what?  Turns out what they have a talent for is something that's really hard to get a job in.  So they turn to teaching and they are terrible, bitter, judgmental teachers.  They might be miserable doing something they don't want to, maybe they are jealous of the talent of their students...who knows?  But I've seen it a lot.  I always wanted to be a teacher and when I was in my undergrad art program this was like \"looked down upon\" that I would WANT to become a teacher.  Looked down on by professors.  It was like they didn't think of themselves as art teachers.  Whatever.  \n\nAnyway, I just want to tell you that I am sorry you had this experience.  If I was your art teacher I would have put my arm around you, said \"don't you worry one bit!\" And I would have plenty of extra clay on hand because a good art teacher is always prepared.  And this wouldn't have been a public discussion for all to hear.  ",
            " I hate hearing people say \"just get a better job\" as if its easy, instantaneous and a new idea. Finding a better job isn't easy. I just switched jobs because I wasn't making enough money. I applied for 75 jobs in about a month and a half. I had 4 interviews. Only offered the one job (two days ago, yay!!!) I get a dollar more an hour now... In about A MONTH  I'll see the first of that pay bump. Until then, I'm going to keep running  out of money two days before payday. Things will change once my education is completed. Also, saying you're not an adult for not having $10 is absurd. My husband lost his job a few months ago. I don't make enough to support us both. Money was scarce as hell for us. And let me tell you, I've never felt like such an adult in my life. In the worst kind of way. Good luck, OP! Everything will turn around and you'll be comfortable financially soon!",
            "Sometimes instructors go on power trips. Believe it or not though, negative feedback from students does count, and if enough students drop the class and the chair removes her class from his certificate, she could be in hot water come evaluation time.

Also, a teacher might have an idea as to what the rules should be, but should be flexible because not all students are the same and not all student populations are the same.  \n\nSo yeah, as a teacher myself, fuck Ms. Wrong Damn Clay. She doesn't even like teaching, apparantly. And don't take the few self-styled tough guys on here so seriously either. Anybody whose hobby is to go online and tell perfect strangers what's wrong with them has a pathetic life. ",

            "Higher Ed teacher admin here\n\nYou did the right thing. Adult students are adults and they make choices in their lives based on their situations. There are an enormous amount of responsibilities that adult students face and financial responsibilities are a big part of that.  The choices that adult students make are their choices and sometimes it is \"do I pay the rent or do I buy the book for this class, or the clay\" or whatever.  No teacher should ever humiliate a student or even point out a student in the class in public who doesn't have the materials he or she needs.   We as teachers don't know that student's situation. \n\nI mildly and semi-jokingly scolded a student the other day for not wearing his glasses to class and sitting in the back when he can't see the board. He told me he never takes his glasses out of the house. I asked him why when he needs them outside probably more than in the house. He said they're too expensive to replace and he's afraid he's going to break them. I told him that sounded like very sound logic.  What else could I say? I'd happily buy him a new pair of glasses if he broke his wearing them to class but that's not the issue. It's that I as a professor never know what my students are facing and that i should never assume that their lack of preparedness or materials means a lack of interest or concern.  \n\nIt's not our place to judge. It's our place to educate the best we can and our students' place to learn the best they can in the way that is the most fitting for them.  I'm sorry you had such a difficult situation with your professor and I'm so glad you stood up for yourself  and that you found support from another professor. Students have rights and you are not subservient to your professors'  demands.  Please keep standing up for yourself  in your educational environment. You help yourself and your fellow students who may not have the same courage to speak up ",

            "Alright, I guess it is my turn to be that person.\n\nThis update does not paint you in a good light. I wasn't sure in the first post but in this one you do sound immature and entitled. It's harsh, I know. But it's important to take responsibility for yourself and you do not seem to.\n\nWhat is extremely unprofessional is the conversation you claim to have had with the department chair. That is extremely unprofessional to say those things to a student about another professor. It is rude, inappropriate, out of place, and horribly disrespectful not only to the other teacher but to the school.\n\nThis thread seems to have turned into people thinking that criticizing OP means we're all hyper-elite rich folk. I went to community college too. I went there because it was all I could afford and because I needed to work full time while in school. And you know what? A lot of my experiences there weren't great. I had teachers who didn't care, who weren't professional, or who were downright rude. And I learned from those experiences which I'm afraid is not what will happen with the attitude you're using here. \n\nYou're not a victim. No one should feel bad for you. You should not feel bad for yourself. You made a mistake, someone handled it poorly, and that should have been the end of it. It did not need to turn into such a dramatic situation (leaving the room crying is very dramatic -- if you get emotional, take a while to compose yourself and return and ask to speak to the person in private to explain). The worst part of what you wrote is that you expect the other student to pay the teacher back for the clay on his/her own. You're complaining that people don't understand and help your financial situation but at the same time you're being extremely inconsiderate and doing the same thing. This other student might be in the same situation -- hell, they may even have it worse. Many of my peers at my community college were single parents living on barely-above-minimum-wage shift jobs and feeding several children. \n\nThe point of this is to say use this moment. Use this as a chance to learn a more external world view, to try to learn from other's perspectives and to grow. You can cushion yourself in the all the \"Go You!\" replies you're getting or you could admit that you played a significant role in the escalation of this situation and that you can do better. \n\nSo I was in your shoes. I went to community college, I lived paycheck to paycheck. But I have come really far since then because I learned to take responsibility for myself and stop expecting people to bend for me. Community college can be an incredible experience because you are surrounded by people who really want to succeed and yet most of them have it way worse than you. Use this to learn how to understand other's perspectives, how to appreciate what you have, and how to take responsibility for yourself. \n\nTLDR: Stop making yourself into a victim, this is what will really mess you up. Take responsibility and use this as a learning experience.",
            "Since the head of the department for your degree is on your side, and is willing to give you an alternative or just waiting to take the class, you don't really need to do this, but it may help: I think you should still go to the head of the art department and talk to him/her about this issue. They may have already have some complaints about her, and yours may help with their decision to remove her from teaching the class in the future. If you were kinda close to other people in your class that you know have problems with her too, you could see if they are willing to speak up about it as well. That is not necessary though, and not your responsibility at this point, since the department chair for your certificate is working with you.",

That teacher sounds like a total tool. \n\nI took a philosophy class once and the first thing the professor said to us after introducing himself on the first day was that he was going to give everyone an A this semester, because we were all going to fail like anyway so why not. He was kinda kidding. He did give everyone an A as far as I can tell. But it was actually a pretty good class. \n\nTeachers, bosses, in-laws, cops, doctors, crazy people can turn up anywhere.

On college the saw I had 4 years of said language on my transcript, bumped me to the intermediate class, and man oh man wtf? We were only allowed to speak in that language. I would go to office hours and the professor would imply I had ADHD for not grasping his wonderful teaching methods. He would monopolize students time outside of class by saying our grades were dependent on going to coffee with him and talking about poetry in his language. I was still wrapped up in my N-mom at the time, and she would scream at me not to quit. Let's say I had to spend another semester with this delightful man.

I didn't actually realsie until I heard a female voice say his name and that she was so excited to spend the night again.\n\nHe said he was excited too and I heard a pecking kiss sort of thing. I hung up.\n\nI text him straight away saying \"I heard it all. Come home immediately. Alone. To talk. Seriosuly\"\n\nThat was 2 hours ago and his phone has now tunred off and I don't know what to do. Help?\n\ntl;dr: Overheard husband and female talk about spending the night and what may have been a kiss. When I asked him to come home he turned off his phone and hasn't been home 4 hours later.\n\nEdit: IT is nearly 1am in the UK. I am off to bed but will update of and when I can. Thanks everyone!\n\nEdit 2: He hasn't turned up for work this morning. He was due in at 10am and its now 12:15. His boss rang me to ask why he was late. I half explained that we'd had a falling out, didn't want to go into too much detail of course. Peter (the boss) said he seemed distant as he clocked off work yesterday evening. \n\nNow this is where things get a little complicated. My husband work in a care home for special needs children, he was still working while doing groceries (it was a shopping trip for the residents too), so he finished work shortly after the phonecall incident. \n\nThis means that the woman in question is either a colleague, or my husband has the complete audacity to risk his job by allowing strangers to join his work activities. I'm trying not to dwell on who the woman could be or I'll be too upset. \n\nI've spoken to all friends, family, any one that might know where my husband is but no one knows. My sister, and my husband's brother have come to an agreement if he is not home by dinner time tonight we will have to report him missing just incase. \n\nALso, for those concerned, I have spoken to a lawyer briefly over the phone, and am seeing him in person tomorrow while my sister babysits. I have also checked our bank and the last access was while husband was shopping before he finished work. No money has gone in or out since.\n\n(Sorry for any mistakes, editing on my mobile while out with the kids, they are a lot chirpier today, but who wouldn't be while at the zoo?!)",

            "I'm sorry this has happened to you.  No one deserves to be treated this way.\n\nI haven't read all the comments yet, but a few things:\n\n1) Your children need to know that it is not their fault.  They will try to get you two back together again, but they need to learn that they did nothing wrong.\n\n2) I saw one comment where you said that your husband is a good father.  Being in that space where you no longer respect your spouse as a partner, but recognize that they need to be able to parent with authority is what I call \"being zen about it\".  It is hard.\n\n3) Tough times are coming.  If you are like me, there will be nights when you are dreaming and you'll dream about your ex and in the dream you'll turn to him and say, \"but you were lying to me\" or \"but you were cheating on me\" and then you'll wake up upset.  That seemed like a dirty deal.  Trying to rise above it and manage your feelings during waking hours, and then be undone by a dream that disturbs your sleep, knowing that you'll need to get up in a couple of hours to get the kids to school and get to work.  You'll be zen about stuff and then one of your children will say that your ex is in love with his girlfriend and you'll want to rant a little, just to set the record straight, or throw off a comment like, \"yeah, well he was in love with me once, and ...\".  But you can't so you try not to show your feelings to your kids because they don't deserve to have to deal with the things that happen in their parent's lives because one of the parents is a selfish son of a bitch.\n\n4) You'll try dating and you realize that you don't really like dating.  You'll really wish that you could have it all back again.  Then you'll find someone and it will be really good and you try to recreate all the intimacy that you had with your husband, but then things happen and it all falls apart.\n\nBut at some point, you'll realize that you are okay, that you have weathered the storm and you are stronger than you ever knew you could be.  You wish that you had not found that out, but you will be the parent that your kids look up to because you have kept the drama out of their lives and you will have special times with them.  You'll wish that you could have shared those times with someone else, but you will be glad for them, nonetheless.\n\nGood luck.",
            "Remain as calm as you can.  Collect your assets and separate his from yours.  DO NOT DRAIN A JOINT BANK ACCOUNT, take out what you will need and put a hold on it.  If it comes up in litigation that you did this you could be in some deep shit.  \n\nRemind yourself of the facts, he is cheating therefore he is in breach of the agreement you guys legally made when you entered into matrimony.  \n\nThe truth is your evidence is circumstantial, any action you take now has to have solid proof.  You said you heard \"what may have been kissing\", that may be true but it will take him admitting it in court for it to be considered foundation for divorce.  Contact your lawyer and only follow their advice.  The advice in this thread is mostly from people who spend way too much time watching movies or reading stories online.  The cooler your head remains the easier this will be for everyone involved.\n\nFor your children, you had good advice in here, be vague.  In time when the divorce comes to fruition find a therapist to help you explain it to them and help them work though it.  \n\nTL;DR: Don't blindly follow the advice in here, you need legal council and a child therapist to help you make the correct decisions.  There are resources available for you that are much more accurate and legal than the advice being offered on Reddit, use them.  \n\nGood luck, I'm sorry you're going through this.  ",
            "My stomach dropped and I feel sad even thinking about this.  I would be so absolutely crushed, but I can't even truly imagine what you're feeling.  You say your sister's a lawyer, and you DO need a lawyer, but I would suggest going outside the family if you can.  Divorces tend to be ugly, especially when someone as apparently cowardly and callous as I am gathering your husband to be from both his ability to do this to you as well as his ignoring you.  Everyone in my family is a lawyer, but unless it is for something as innocuous as a traffic ticket, I'd always search outside immediate family just to avoid dragging more emotion into it.  Just a suggestion.  Either way, best of luck.",

Dont let him take advantage of that and get what he wants. Dont let him use the kids against you, in the same light, dont use them against him. Do your best to leave the kids out of it, but keep them in mind when you both make your decisions.  \r\rLife will clearly be different for all of you. The kids will live separate lives in each house hold. But those lives dont have to be bad. Just let if be clear that you want the best for your children.

            "My dad cheated on my mom, so I know sort of what you're going through. While you said that you wouldn't bad-mouth him in front of your kids, you also need to make sure that when he comes home, which should be soon (he'll need to collect his stuff/beg for mercy), you need to make sure that your children are not around. If they absolutely have to be there, avoid any form of verbal confrontation. Don't argue, don't yell, don't make accusations; because if your kids hear this, they will use it against him. So, if you and/or your (ex) husband are... verbal people, you need to send your kids somewhere else, whether it be Grandma's, Grandpa's, their Aunt's or Uncle's. If you both are not verbal people, then you can keep them in the house, but make an effort not to yell or instigate anything with your husband. My parents divorced when I was 7, and I used to periodically use it on my dad when I'd become upset with him. \n\nI'm really sorry this happened to you, OP.

Also sweet shout out to whoever decided to pm me and say that this was all my fault for making my boyfriend want to escape reality and play video games so much. I hope Jesus finds you before Chuck Norris does... sorry my \"sick\" burns still derive from middle school. \n\n\n\n\nSo on to the update. After submitting the post I read through a lot of material on how to quell gaming addictions and help me explain my boundaries without forcing an ultimatum on my SO. So a day after I went out and bought books from a second hand store. I tried to get two copies of each. I went on Groupon and signed up for a ton of couple courses (fitness, painting, anything). I also cleaned out our refrigerator of a lot of ready to eat meals/snacks and purchased a lot of food that requires some prep ranging from 5 minutes to 30.\n\n\n\nWhen he got home that night I cleared off our kitchen table and asked him if he'd sit with me, no electronics. We had a pad of paper between us and I asked him if he'd write out how much time on average he spends on certain activities during the week/weekend. Work was 40-45 hours, carpool was about 8 hours, weekday gaming 36 hours (hour before work, at least two hours cumulated at work, hour on the way home from work, and average of five hours once home into the night), misc activities an hour (chores and household or grocery shopping). Weekend numbers for gaming were more or less the same fluctuating between 40-45 (saturday, sunday, monday). I asked him to count \"quality\" time between us for the week. As in minimal electronics, cooking together, coffee dates, hiking, dog walking, engaging conversation, sex... it totaled to roughly five hours a whole week, including weekends. \n\n\nI then asked him to rank important aspects of his life. They could be in a more important first manner, or just \"here are 10 things that are all equally important to me\". I was the third thing written. His family and security (financial, home, auto are all rolled into that) were the first he thought of, but I'm ok with that. I'd rank my family first too until we are together a lot longer or married. Our dog, traveling, learning, and health also made the list. \n\n\nI showed him the list vs. how he spends his time. \n\n\nSo I asked him to compare the list of things he thought were important to how he spends his time. And that's when the tears started. He asked me if this was my way of saying the relationship was over, and I told him no, but I need attention too. Living with your SO seems like an easy way to spend quality time, and I suppose it can be, but it doesn't mean you should stop \"dating\".\n\n\n\n\nI asked him if there was any reason his video gaming had been increasing as five months ago he didn't play this much. He said that it started as him being a little depressed about our finances, his job being so high strung, and not being able to go out as much wanted because of the finances (traveling, expensive sushi, what have you). He also felt pressure from some of his friends to play more as this was all they did. We talked about my gaming and how he would like for me to play more but recognizes that the fun is taken out of it if he begs me to play every day and is a majority of what he talks about.  In the end the gaming just became a weird solace for him. At first he used it to escape his financial fear, but later it just became a safe space that he was used to. He described it like going to your grandmas when you're upset with your parents only to really recognize how much you love being in her home and how she comforts you... So you try and visit her as much as possible, anything that can kind of trigger sadness and it's off to grandma's. They're out of my favorite kind of chips at the vending machine? Time to play video games real quick so I feel good. \n\n\n\n\nSo we made a plan. I made it clear that I don't want to feel neglected in a relationship for any reason, that I like video gaming with him but I need more stimulation from him than quality time via coop mode. I brought out the books I bought and showed him the groupons I found and we reworked our weekly schedule so that during those free hours he has other activities to try that I'll be doing too. We didn't completely cut out his gaming time but we made set amounts per day. Carpool? Play all you want or read. At work? minimize it as much as possible by reading or working on work related activities so a promotion and raise are in sight to help quell financial freak out nerves. At home? Activities as much as possible with the promise that Sunday's we play video games together for around five hours schedule permitting. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far there's been one hiccup. Not major, he told me immediately that he overplayed and would be deleting his apps to get rid of the temptation. He's trying some therapy to help cope and though it's early I think he really is working hard to make things better. He cooks with me and a lot more in general, we play card games, we have our own read at your pace book club (we read a book a week at this point; onto book four soon), and through our activities stay as busy as possible. On our gaming days we make pizza together and make snacks and get ready to destroy on coop mode. He likes being able to do coop more than gaming alone and says that having a big day with him and I is makes not playing as much during the week worth it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm cautiously optimistic at this point. It's great that he's throwing himself so heavily into everything else, but moderation is still key. Thank you all very much again for help and ideas. \n\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: So far things are looking up. We sat down and he recognized how much time during the week he spends on video games and we're working on cutting it down. He's been fairly good thus far. Thank you!",

            "This is literally the best thing you could have done. Sounds weird but thank you for making it a point not to attack him and making sure he really had an issue first. My SO loves games, but didn't really play any when we first got together. Eventually he would but if he would ask me first, always figured it was because we had limited time together so never questioned it. Then we moved in together and he still asked, finally I had to basically say \"I don't care if you're playing games, half the time I am too or I'm sucked into a book. You don't have to ask me\" (laughing/joking tone through out, sounds super harsh when I read it in text) \n\nApparently his last gf had gone absolutely ape shit nuts over him playing video games. We're talking 3 hours or so at a time every few days or beating the hard level/boss for his siblings (he's the oldest). And he quit his alone gaming but refused to not help/play a few rounds with his siblings, part of why they split. \n\nHe still asks every so often, I've started being sarcastically over dramatic saying, \"Oh my God no how dare you play that game you just bought\" (on sale and using old games as trade ins, super hard to convince him to spend actual money on it), humor of it seems to help.\n\nBonus points-Found a profile on their dad's consol with her name and likeness, never figured out if it was hers or one of the siblings trying to frame her lmao.\n\nAnyway thank you for your approach and I'm happy it went as well as it did.

But that's not how you wrote your post.\n\n\nI think how you handled the situation was very mature. A lot more than when I was in that situation haha. I actually consider myself a gamer (or at least used to!) And my SO is definitely one, but addicted. He would play online games with his friends, so he'd be on Mic. I hated that because I'd try and talk to him, and he wouldn't hear me, so I'd repeat myself, and he'd get mad at me.. Claiming he heard me, and yet didn't acknowledge it. OR.... I would say something then 5 minutes later \"what?\". So I started doing my own thing when he gamed. Played my own, read, etc..... But.. that became an issue because I \"wouldn't talk to him\".. It was very frustrating, but he finally got it under control a couple years ago.\n\n\nI'm sure he's still addicted to it, but instead of playing for HOURS while I worked (he did also, but still....) and did ALL of the house work. We had a baby and he was laid off, so not working full time. He stepped up and finally realized how much I did and how little he did.... -_-\nbut\n\n\nGood luck to you! \ud83d\ude0a",

Ignoring her job (family business so she knew they wouldn't fire her) and her college work (failed all 4 classes).\n\nI finally had enough one day after weeks of dealing with it. She stayed up the whole night. She took a little nap and I ran around and got her coffee and breakfast from town. Got back woke her up, got her shower running and her in it, cleaned her desk and area.\n\nWhen she got out I asked her if she could cut back a little on gaming. Her response was to dump me. \n\nI found out later that day she was talking to a guy on the video game behind my back and deleting the messages. \n\nShe started dating that guy within an hour of dumping my ass and proceeded to stay at my house for another 3 days til I finally kicked her out.\n\nShe's now doing drugs and dating guys on tinder for a week or so at a time then moving on.\n\nI was heartbroken but now I'm taking back control and am working on losing weight.\n\nSeriously congrats to you for not dealing with it.",

Let him game for a couple hours a day, it's not hurting anybody as long as he holds a job and takes care of whatever he's supposed to do at home. And yes, you should be a priority, but if you stifle him too much he'll end up resenting you. Also for the morons saying a 30-year-old is a man-child for gaming, ever heard of Rooster Teeth? A group of men in their 30s built a COMPANY around gaming. It's a legitimate passion for some people, deal with it. I'm not justifying addiction, but he should be allowed to game a little every day if he wants. Just as someone who loves to read should be able to read every day, or a biker to bike every day. Gaming, despite popular opinion, is just as valid as any other hobby. \ntl;dr Let him be himself as long as it doesn't interfere with his job and he makes time for you too.",

            "As someone who is an avid gamer, my SO understands that just because I'm playing a video game doesn't mean I don't care about her. I'll blow her a kiss or something like that every so often or take a 5 minute break for cuddles but other than that I sometimes \"ignore\" her for hours unless she wants to talk about something serious or really wants to do something specific. If she started telling me I could only play for x hours a day I wouldn't be happy about that because me not directly spending time with her doesn't devalue our relationship. She is able to understand this and lets me do what I want and in return I'm as loving as can be when we're communicating.  The only difference between our situations is that I don't have to play video games if I'm out doing something. I get the urge now and then but it's definitely not overpowering most of the time. \n\nI think you just have an incompatibility with your SO here. You think him doing what he loves to do devalues your relationship. If him doing his favorite activity a lot doesn't sit well with you then you guys simply aren't compatible. Making him do things he doesn't like to do (reading?  For a gamer?) in order to preserve the relationship is going to breed resentment even if he isn't vocal about it. If he's legitimately addicted then the therapy is the only thing I can see helping the situation. Other than that you either need to accept his hobby (however excessive it is) or move on. \n\nOf course I don't know virtually anything about your relationship, but I have an insanely strong bond with my SO. If she started telling me I can't play video games as much anymore the bond would slowly start breaking. Luckily she is completely fine with me doing it because she can feel every day how much I love her despite spending all that time being distracted from her. He's not going to be happy if he gets less than 90% of his free time into video games if there's nothing else to do, telling you right now. ",
