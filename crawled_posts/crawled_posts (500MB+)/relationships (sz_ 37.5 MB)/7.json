        "selftext": "[Link to my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6cjph9/how_do_i_26f_tell_my_husband_31m_im_addicted_to/)\n\nI've been sober since May 22, 2017 :)\n\nIt's been almost a year and a half since I posted, I was a mess that day and really overwhelmed. You all gave me the push I needed to gather my courage and tell my husband about my drug use, **thank you so much for that**. I mean it, I knew he needed to know but I couldn't make myself follow through until I received encouragement a bunch of internet strangers. I hate to think what might have happened had I continued hiding it from him.\n\nMy husband has been supportive, compassionate, and kind throughout my recovery. I wouldn't be doing so well today without him, there aren't words to express how much I love him and how grateful I am to be married to such a good man. With the help of my therapist I was able to open up to him about being raped (it was a violent, ugly, all around horrible incident) and the effect PTSD has had on me (it's an explanation, not an excuse, for the drug use). \n\nWe've had to work on rebuilding trust and I realize that's going to take time. He still prefers I stay home most of the time and he has reservations about new friends- both are totally reasonable in my opinion. I understand his feelings completely. We do more together now and I feel more included in his life, which has really helped my mental health. Every day I do my best to prove my love, appreciation, and respect for him. We're both continually putting effort into ourselves and our marriage.\n\nAs for my recovery, I honestly feel a little weird calling it that. I didn't use long term and didn't face many of the same challenges as other addicts. But I am an addict, I'm always aware of that and I realize I'm no different fundamentally from someone doing heroin on the streets.\n\nDrugs were a distraction and a way to escape bad memories and nightmares. They were also part of my social life as my only friend in the area (at that time) used them too. Once I accepted that I had, and will always have, PTSD and began getting proper treatment I didn't want anything to do with drugs. I'm extremely lucky and thankful I stopped when I did.\n\nDealing with my mental health hasn't been easy. Last August I went to a behavioral health hospital for six days. I didn't want to go at first but my husband and therapist convinced me I needed to- they were right. I felt much better afterward and I met a few people like me while I was there, it made me feel better to know I wasn't alone. People can say that you aren't alone all the time but it's different when you actually experience it.\n\nMy husband and I went to couples' therapy for 3 months. It helped us quite a bit, we realized we needed to talk about things that hadn't occurred to either of us before sitting down with a therapist. It helped me understand his feelings and how my drug use (and concealing it from him) affected him. It helped him understand why I did what I did. It gave us a safe place to talk and that eventually led to better communication in private.\n\nI'm still seeing a therapist twice a month and attend group therapy once a month. I'm stable, healthy, and happy. I love my life and I'm really excited about the future. We're expecting a baby in the Spring and I can't wait to be a mom. I'm so looking forward to raising a family with my husband. Life is good. :) Thanks again, /r/relationships \n\n**TL;DR**: I've been sober since May 22, 2017. My husband and I are doing well, we're happy and very much in love. He's supported me and loved me through this process. We've had a few struggles along the way but we work through things as they come up and move forward. I'm continuing to receive treatment for my mental health and I feel stronger than I ever have. I've learned I can't hide from my problems and now that I've received the appropriate treatment for PTSD I don't want to hide from it anymore. I'm finally happy and excited about my life and my future.",

Recovery is a hard road- I\u2019m glad you have someone to help you stay grounded. \n\nI am a FF/Medic also I often feel either it helps us become very empathetic or some a little jaded and bitter.  \n\nIf you ever need to talk I\u2019m here- Not sure if your husband would be interested but NA-ANON or AL-ANON might be a place that could help him process things and learn skills that will help him and you in the long run.  I\u2019ve found AL-NON helpful personally. \n\nWishing you continued strength! ",
            "On the \"out of the house\" and \"friends\" disapproval, I understand and have some comments...\n\nAs addicts many of us will tend to, consciously or otherwise, allow influencers into our lives... And more often than acceptable, we want enablers and reinforces. \n\nFriends and social influences are powerful; they serve as justification and excuse for relapse. It IS reasonable to maintain a degree of vigilance with social connections, but deserves more discretion and consideration than a blanket \"policy\" cutting you out of society.\n\nTry something like... Fucking clay or Magic:The Gathering or eldercare volunteer or some weird social thing where you can interact completely disassociated from substance abuse. THAT is more palatable than isolation.\n\nWhile we like to say that our loved ones and family are enough of a reason to live, knowing about the beauty of the world they LIVE IN is something I find necessary.\n\n",

I've spent the last week and a half planning a funeral and dealing with funeral homes for my son's mom. She was the love of my life(despite our issues) and she overdosed on fentanyl on the 28th. To be blunt, she was my spouse and my grief cannot be put into words. That's the road you were heading down. You've done the right thing so far. Stick with it.

            "Congrats on your sobriety op!!! \n\nRegarding him being nervous about you going out, I understand his concern but it\u2019s also unhealthy so I have a suggestion \n\nI am dating a recovering addict of over a year and our solution is to have regular drug testing. We say we do it weekly but in reality we forget all the time. Some oeople call this crazy but for us it works entirely for one reason: if he ever gets that urge to think well, I can do it just this one time and stop and nobody would ever know... he knows it\u2019s not true. He will never be able to do it just the once and not get caught again. The possibility of getting tested is always there, it\u2019s a reminder that no matter how he might rationalize that it\u2019s just a one off it won\u2019t be and it would ruin our relationship\n\nAgain, some people will think it\u2019s too much. The thing is I\u2019m very confident in his sobriety and don\u2019t do it because I think he\u2019s doing drugs behind my back. It\u2019s just our open door policy. In my mind no different than when a partner straysromantically and there\u2019s an open phone policy... though I\u2019d never stay with a cheater lol. But I\u2019m proud of my partners recovery and I don\u2019t want to keep him from making friends or going out and being tempted. In my eyes, a routine test feels healthier then him worrying about what you\u2019re doing when he isn\u2019t around",
            "A year and a half clean equates to like 10 years in terms of sobriety. That is a very big accomplishment. You should be proud of yourself!",

Did not expect to update at all, unless something miraculous happened.  And it did.\n\nIn short, I have the best friends in the world.\n\nI read through a ton of these comments, but not all (over 1000?!)  and decided to look for my fiance's box of wedding planning stuff, because I had a suspicion.  Inside the box was all these magazine clippings of a big church wedding, flower ideas and stuff.  And then I saw pictures of the dresses.  They were all big, poofy ornate things that don't seem akin to my fiancee's style at all.  But...they're similar to the dresses my sisters wore at their weddings.\n\nIt all sort of clicked for me.  My fiancee probably doesn't want a church wedding or any of these fancy trimmings, she's trying to win my family's favor.  The hell.  I really should've noticed this earlier and gotten more involved, I know.\n\nMy fiancee flew home on Thursday to spend a few days with her dad (Father's Day weekend and all).  I couldn't go because of work, so I was alone until this morning.  So, real late at night, I called up my buddy Ravi (26M).  Ravi's my best man, we've known each other since we were kids, split up when we went off to college, and reconnected three years ago.  We moved to SC so I could join the company he works for. \n\nI just opened up to Ravi.  It was really late but he listened to me anyway, about my worries about my fiancee.  He said that it was very likely that she was trying to curry favor with my family, but she probably wasn't going to admit to it easily.  He said he'd talk to her.\n\nI told him that he barely knows her.  He said not to worry, and that he'd be around tomorrow evening.\n\nMy fiancee came home happy (she always is after seeing her dad) this morning.  I went off to work without asking about the wedding, and she set to work on her writing (she's off for the summer).  I got home early and at like 5 PM Ravi came to my house with my other good friends: Carson, Andrew, and Tim (23-30M).  I know all these guys from various places and we're all a solid group.  Still, this was unexpected.\n\nRavi came up to my fiancee and said that the guys were taking her wedding dress shopping.\n\nWe were both freaked out as hell.  I had no idea this was coming, and my fiancee looked like she wanted to crawl into a hole and die.  She whispered to me \"they won't like me\", and I urged her to just go for it.  Ravi reminded her that he has sisters, Carson's been divorced, and Andrew's had his fair share of girlfriends, so they know dresses.  Plus, he has a lady friend that works at a small boutique, where they'd try first.\n\nShe still didn't want to go, and then he said something like \"hey, you're marrying our best friend, don't you think we should get to know you and make sure you're not a ghost or something?\"  (He's not great with tact).  But she chuckled a little at that and gave in.\n\nThey were gone for a while and came back an hour ago.  They didn't find a dress, but they looked around the stores for a while and fiancee found a style she liked (not the poofy ball gown style).  They also went out for ice cream and when they walked in the door, she was joking and laughing with them all.  I hadn't seen her so happy in a long time.  It was amazing.\n\nThen we all sat down together and Ravi asked her to talk to me about what's on her mind.\n\nI still don't know how they got her to open up.  She whispered that she didn't really want the big church wedding, that she wanted to wait a little while and plan a small ceremony for just the people we really care about.  I was all for it, I told her not to worry about bridesmaids or anything, it could just be us.  She said no, she wants her dad, the guys, and my family to be there.  \n\nAndrew, a kickass guitar player, said he'd put together a band for us.  He asked my fiancee what her favorite song is, he'd figure out an arrangement.  This is the kind of question she usually dodges, but she blushed a little and actually told the truth.  (Panama by Van Halen if anyone cares; girl knows how to rock out).  This was the real sign that she's starting to trust them.  I don't think anyone knows her favorite song except me and her dad (who bought her Van Halen CD's growing up)\n\nI told her I'd call my family and tell them the church wedding's off.  If they make a big stink about it, I don't fucking care.  I have my bros and my beautiful future bride.  That's all the family I need.\n   \n**tl;dr**: Church wedding's off, my friends are awesome, future looks bright so far.",

It feels like an ENORMOUS weight has been lifted off my shoulders. \n\nShortly after my original post I met someone by chance at a wedding and fell in love. This person is everything my ex husband was not. The kindness, compassion, and respect they show not just me, but to my daughter as well, is like something from a dream. I never knew love could be so easy. \n\nTo anyone in a loveless marriage reading this-LEAVE. Do the hard thing- ESPECIALLY if they have a pattern of leaving/returning/cheating, etc. Lord knows I was terrified to cut the cord. At one point in time I was actually starting to feel bad for the guy because he was begging me every single day for another chance. He tried to convince me that getting a divorce would ruin my future, our daughters future, that she would come from a \u201cbroken family\u201d- but it was the exact opposite. It was broken already and I fixed it. Once I made up my mind that divorce was the best option, I absolutely thrived. I learned independence. I found how to be happy on my own. I found happiness in a partner. Life has never been so sweet. The bad shit makes the good shit so much better. Thank you, Reddit, for the support on my original post. It helped turn my graveyard into a garden. \n\nTL;DR: I divorced him and found true happiness.",

            "Kudos on realizing he wasn't being honest and being able to walk!  Having been in that situation, it's difficult to play against the years of emotions you had built up.\n\n> Shortly after my original post I met someone by chance at a wedding and fell in love. This person is everything my ex husband was not. The kindness, compassion, and respect they show not just me, but to my daughter as well, is like something from a dream. I never knew love could be so easy.\n\nI also did this.   It turned out to be painful.  I won't be as arrogant to suggest your guy turns out the same type of person as the \"dream woman\" I found, but maybe try and make sure you take things slow?   \n\nAn analogy is say you are in prison for X years (the number of years you were married).   Everyday you eat crappy meals, live in a crappy cell - you know it can be better out there from the time before you were in prison, but the daily grind of it has you only seeing that.   Then you get released!    You wander around and find a McDonalds and OMG the food is incredible!   You get choices!!   I mean prison food didn't have that!   Condiments, what!!   I can order again if I'm still hungry?   They have kids meals?  I can't believe they thought about my kid!\n\nPoint being, you have trash as a relationship comparison right now.   It's not hard to look like a knight in shining armour against that is it?   Also the years you were in that crap relationship, they do take a toll.   Part of the problem(s) I experienced were that I had emotional triggers just waiting to trip me up, but anything that was too closely related to my ex was just something that would immediately set me into a bad mood... and then an argument.   Oh and the Mrs. Right, turned out to be fishing for a \"nice guy\" and realized I was super easy to fool - she knew my ex and it wasn't rocket science for her to figure out what about her I was not liking - then just \"casually demonstrate\" she was better at those things.   This facade didn't last beyond a year, because it's hard to maintain something like that - but, yeah I wish I would have moved a lot slower - especially in a serious relationship so close to a divorce.\n\n\ntl;dr: Kudos for realizing your ex isn't giong to change.   Highly recommend going slow with the new guy in terms of progressing in levels of seriousness, have fun and enjoy not being in a toxic relationship!",

After posting it, I read my own words and realized that the relationship was over. I was making excuses for him and justifying staying miserable in the relationship because I just loved him so much. \n\nWe had a talk when I visited my hometown and broke up. We both were emotional but knew it was  for the best, and I was content thinking we were going to spend time being single and discovering who we are as individuals after being so close for so long. \n\nUnfortunately, that wasn\u2019t the case. I found out he had been cheating for at least a couple months before telling me he wanted another break. He began officially dating the new girl about 3 days after we broke up and he moved in with her after a couple months of dating. He has always been super resistant to commitments before, so that came as a shock. My self esteem took a huge hit. \n\nNow things are different. I discover new things about myself every day, I spend time with my friends who make me feel loved and important, and I\u2019m truly happy for the first time in a long time. At first I wanted to start dating again and I told myself I was ready, but the truth is that there\u2019s so much I don\u2019t know about myself yet, and I want to get to know me before I focus on another relationship. \n\nAnyway, thank you to the people who commented and let me know that something was going on. As obvious as it was to them, I was completely blindsided. I\u2019m just grateful to be out of that situation and I\u2019m excited for what\u2019s ahead.\n\nTl;dr : we broke up, he was cheating, I\u2019m much better now",

            "Congratulations, I truly believe you will be way happier than him, if not already. It takes a lot of strength to go through the self-discovery process and I think you still have some more revelations about your ex-boyfriend/relationship that you are going to discover.\n\nI know you said your self-esteem took a hit when he moved in with his next girlfriend, but it won\u2019t be sunshine and rainbows that you think it is. First, if he cheated on you with her, he will cheat on her - and that is the opposite of commitment. Second, there relationship is already showing signs that is an unhealthy one e.g, the relationship is moving way too fast if they have already moved in together - I think you would fully understand and have a revelation about this when you go into your next relationship when your ready. \n\nIt also sounds like he doesn\u2019t know how to be single - he jumped from one relationship to another instantly - this is where you have the hugest one-up on him because you are starting to discover how you can love yourself without any validation from anyone else and that is a powerful thing because the more you love yourself, the more confident you are and the more people you attract because of it.

My first thought when hearing that he moved in with someone right after a breakup is that he was probably compensating for his sense of loss, stability and connection to you. He was afraid of commitment and as soon as you broke up with him for lack of commitment he made a huge commitment with someone else.  That screams insecurity to me. You are both young and it seems that he is much less emotionally mature than you.  I\u2019m glad that you ended an unhealthy relationship and have given yourself time to grow and explore what another relationship feels like.  A healthy, happy relationship is the best feeling in the world.

            "Best decision you can make! Stay alone for a while and get to know yourself better!, I went through a break up 3 years ago (I had a 6 year relationship) and decided to stay alone cause I was too young when we started and also I wanted her back so much that I thought that it was not a good sign and that before going into a new relationship or something like that, I had to learn how to be okay just being alone and know myself better.\n\nIt was the best decision, 3 years have passed,  I started dating again, made some mistakes and learned from them, started going on trips and since last year started going on trips by my own cause I love having my friends with me but also I can have a great time just being alone.\n\nMy new girlfriend came at a really good time, I was healed and ready to start a new relationship and knowing what I want in a serious relationship, we weren't expecting this tho but I haven't felt this way in so long and it feels so good to have someone with you, even tho we have things in common, there are things we don't but we respect and learn from the other, we also come from different cultures but that's not a big deal.\n\nJust be patient with yourself and I wish you the best!",

            "Sorry to hear this but I think it's a good thing to think about.  You said he wasn't the type to be sneaky (in the original thread) and even felt like everything was going good, except for this strange behavior that he gets to express concern about the relationship every year, and want to go on a break.\n\nAlso, the idea that a person seems hard to commit to you, but does it for another -- this is why reddit users sometimes say, \"just break up, a happy and healthy relationship shouldn't be this hard\". \n\nHe was capable of commitment, just not to you.\n\nSo I do strongly suggest that as much as we love the other person and the other person says they love us, if there are some concerns -- try to figure them out together or if things keep repeating themselves to give the same problems and issues, consider some other options, ie, breaking up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "For future reference, after 2 years of seriously dating, if a marriage isn't firmly on the table then seriously consider where the relationship is going.  Anyone that really loves you will do anything to be with you.  They won't give you bullshit commitment reasons. They definitely won't need a break from the relationship. They will move their schedule around to spend more time with you.  Real love cherishes you and isn't flimsy on how they feel about being with you.  Never make excuses for someone.

            "I\u2019m sorry that happened to you. But do not let your self-esteem suffer. I have in the past broke up with awesome guys, very cute, very educated, and they treated me so great. People told me I was stupid for breaking up with them. I just didn\u2019t have feelings for them for some reason. I wish I could of. And I have dated and been dumped by guys who were objectively less attractive, treated my terribly, and do not have nearly as much going for them as the men I have decided I would not be with. However, I was devastated by these break ups. Some people are emotional or illogical. Sometimes you want to create feelings for people and you just can\u2019t. If someone breaks up with you for someone else, it\u2019s not because they are \u201cbetter\u201d at anything. It could be 1000 reasons and more than half of them are illogical. In any case, I\u2019m telling you this to let you know, don\u2019t let your self esteem take a hit.  I\u2019m happy you are taking care of yourself. ",
            "The exact same thing happened to me. He was talking about marrying me at first and then started to get less and less committal and \u201cuncertain about marriage.\u201d Finally going on breaks all the time. I finally couldn\u2019t handle it anymore and called it quits and now he\u2019s married to the other girl. \n\nThe thing that finally made me get over him was realizing for certain that my life was so much better without him and his drama. I was able to travel and put myself first and grow relationships with people that I didn\u2019t expect. Take your time with dating. I wasn\u2019t ready for a few years but now I feel I\u2019m in a place where I live myself enough to know what I want again and can give to another person. ",
            "Kudos girl! This time, doing it intentionally to focus on you and what you need to be happy, is going to give the insight you need to grow into a person who demands (in physical presence, not vocally) a healthy, fulfilling relationship. Then, one day, you'll meet someone, and while it can be compromising and frustrating, it will just work and flow. \n\nI have been trying to explain this to my mid-50's, serial monogamist mother. She finally left her 3rd and final husband and has finally seen some of the patterns her lack of insight created in her life. She got a room for rent by the beach, and is living a life where she is in the number 1 spot, considering her well being and happiness as paramount, realizing it doesn't take nearly as much work to maintain and couldn't be happier. The last year has been quite repairing.\n\nIt's a lesson we all have to learn. \n\nOh... and don't be surprised, if he sees you after, lessons learned and implemented, beautifully independent and possibly with a guy who blows him out of the water, he tries to weasel his way back to you. If he does, remember, will be the same person who doesn't deserve you.\n\nThis is something I went through and in my experience he had a baby with the girl he cheated on me with, and married the girl he cheated on her with.",
            "Don\u2019t keep wasting your time ",
            "What you said resonated with me a lot, especially when you talked about both of you becoming better people. I broke up with my girlfriend, and we both had some issues. I wasn't very attentive or affectionate, and she was self-centered and would not work with me as a team.\n\nAfter we broke up, I realized how my negligence impacted her. I tried to change into a person that better recognized when people depended on me so I wouldn't let them down or I could give them the attention they desired. I had hoped that being single would help her grow as well, maybe turn into someone who understands why not acknowledging someone's feelings will hurt them in the long run.\n\nInstead, she got a boyfriend a month later. I'm not upset by the fact that she got someone new so quickly, but I am disappointed because I feel like it will stunt her emotional growth to be with someone else. If a person is stunted in some way, it takes a lot of work and self-introspection to change into a better version of yourself. It also takes a lot of work and introspection to make a relationship work. I worry that she isn't going to see as much individual growth if she is also working on forming a new relationship, and that's disappointing.\n\nAll of that is to say that I'm glad you also saw the breakup as a moment to grow. Too bad you ex is too distracted with someone else to do the same.",

I texted BF, telling him essentially that I needed a bit of space to take a breather and reevaluate. I made it clear that I didn\u2019t want to break up, but felt like I was always being monitored and I wanted to make a game plan to have healthy communication through this pandemic. \n\nHe called me super upset and accused me of choosing SB over him. I told him that it wasn\u2019t about SB, it\u2019s not like I chose SB, he\u2019s literally just someone I get along with who I can hang out with during the pandemic. I explained to him that it was not like I was spending every waking moment with him, I do my homework in the morning, we hang out in the afternoon, and my evening time is divided between the 4 of us (mom, stepdad, SB) and FaceTiming BF. \n\nBF then accused me of doing special, \u201cboyfriend\u201d activities with SB. He told me that it was always his dream to teach me to drive (he doesn\u2019t even have his permit. Am I supposed to wait around for him to get it?). Also apparently me teaching SB how to bake bread? Which is stupid because I was going to make the bread to begin with, and SB \u201chelped\u201d by moving the heavy mixer, eating half the almond slices, and taking pictures for Instagram. \n\nHe also screamed at me for not moving in, saying how all this would have been prevented if we were living together. I told him that I have no interest in living somewhere that I\u2019m not allowed to be. I can\u2019t afford a fine from bylaw, and if I were to get kicked out, it would be more difficult to find my way home since I don\u2019t drive. \n\nIn the end, I told BF that I would not give up my relationship with SB, who is part of my family and a genuinely nice guy, to ease my BFs insecurities and cater to his demands. I told BF that I needed time to cool down, and that I\u2019d talk to him in a few days. That was all on Friday, and today I reached out to see how he was. He was still pissed at me and accusatory, so I basically told him that this wasn\u2019t working and I want to break up. I did it over text and then blocked him, which probably makes me an asshole, but I literally couldn\u2019t deal with anymore of him yelling at me and insulting my family. \n\nAnyway thanks to everyone who commented. I\u2019m really sad this is the outcome and I\u2019ve been crying a lot, but I\u2019m also kind of relieved. \n\nTLDR: we broke up because he couldn\u2019t see how controlling he was being.",

            "The fact that he screamed at you is a huge red flag. I would have serious reservations in moving forward with this boy. He feels threatened by your family for no apparent reason and him being possessive and wanting you to move in is a classic controller move.",
            "Congrats! Celebrate! You dodged a missile. Your ex bf is a toxic abusive narcissist! The fact that he wanted you to break the law to move in with him is INSANE! This pandemic exposed who he really was. Be thankful. If he acted this way over your *family*, he would have accused you of sneaking around and having o\\*rgies with his roommates. His tantrums might have turned physical. For your sake, I hope he remains an ex.\n\nETA: you're not an asshole for breaking up via text. He's abusive and left you no choice. You did good.",

            "Good job OP that was complete nonsense on his part. You can find someone much more reasonable.",
            "Oh, OP, you handled this so exceptionally well!\n\nAt every step you showed a very adult thoughtfulness, you laid down and defended boundaries, you gave your ex chances to save face, and most of all, you looked at the situation *clearly*:  you didn't allow your thoughts to be clouded by fantasies of how things could be if only you could change him.\n\nI know it will sound like a strange thing to say, but this was a *good* break-up:  You have learned you can stand up for yourself in a difficult situation, and that the world won't end because you walked away from an unsuitable boy.  \n\n10/10.\n\nYes, you will hurt for a while, but that relief you're feeling tells me that you won't be in pain for long.  \n\nP.S.  Two things:  *breaking up by text is* ***fine.***  I know some redditors liken it to shoving an ex onto the next train to Auschwitz, but it was the pragmatic thing to do--you already knew how he would react and there was no point in putting yourself through his verbal abuse.  You aren't supposed to accept abuse as some kind of punishment for breaking up with someone, that's just...insane.\n\nAlso?  You didn't break up with your bf because \"because he couldn\u2019t see how controlling he was being;\" you broke up with him **because he was controlling.**  Don't make the mistake of insisting that there must be *intentionality* for bad behavior to count as \"bad.\" The point is that when you explained that his behavior hurt you, *he refused to stop.*\n\nThat's it.  If behavior hurts you, *then it hurts you.*  You don't need testimony and receipts \"proving\" that he was doing it deliberately in order to be upset.  If someone with good intentions is told, \"Hey, that thing you're doing?  It hurts me.  Please stop,\" they...*stop.*\n\nYour ex didn't stop with the control *because he didn't care how you felt about it.*  That's all you ever needed to know.",

            "Never, ever, EVER give in to jealous bullshit. I see you\u2019ve already broken up, AND blocked him, and that\u2019s definitely for the best. Blocking this type is almost always the only way to end it, because they won\u2019t let it go if they still have a way to contact you. \n\nBut I\u2019d be willing to bet he\u2019s not done. I know this type. If he can find another way to contact you, he\u2019s going to do the \u201ccrawling back\u201d, perhaps with a grand gesture, and with all the apologies and crying and anything else he thinks you want to hear. \n\nDon\u2019t fall for it. They\u2019ll do literally anything to get you pulled back in. And they get very, very angry when the crawling/apology phase doesn\u2019t work and they realize you\u2019ve actually escaped their field of gravity, truly slipped their grasp. If the pitiful apology or perhaps grand gesture followed by SHOCKING anger/cruelty after it doesn\u2019t work hasn\u2019t happened yet...be aware he may not be done yet. \n\nJealous types don\u2019t accept breakups with just a few assholish comments They simply don\u2019t. Blocking all avenues for him to contact you and keeping it that way is by far the smartest thing you can do.",

Girls night out? Late night days at work? Out of town vaca with your friends? Sounds like a headache and more.",
            "You dodged a bullet there. It's hard with relationships that turn controlling because the beginning is usually good/great. They have to get you to stick around, then you get attached and get it to where you would be the one to feel bad about leaving because \"other than this one thing the relationship has been good\". then, like people were saying, they start testing boundaries and \"one thing\" turns to recurring things, to no friends, no family time and before you know it your relationship centers on fear more than real love. Anytime anyone gets that mad at you for not doing what they want over what you want or makes you comfortable, turn and walk away. It can be to walk away for them to calm down, see reason and apologize or it can be a full walk away. People who can see their issues, work on them and fix them themselves are the ones you might give a chance to. Anyone who does what he did by yelling, continuing to yell and then yelling more when you tried to take time to give him a chance, deserves no more time or attention from you. \n\nTake this to learn from and find yourself someone that can trust and appreciate you, not try to control you. Also, have fun bonding with your family.",

            "Wow, you are so much better off now.",
            "I normally hate the idea of breaking up via text, but that's better than ghosting. But in your case, you made the right call. He would cry and get angry and manipulate and berate you on the phone or facetime for sure, which he shouldnt be given the power to do. He does need to grow up more before he gets another relationship, but he doesnt seem to be willing to grow his self awareness.\n\nYou made the right call for sure haha. Dont feel bad at all!",
            "Good job.  I just told my wife \"i am upset that your grandmother is teaching you how to sew when it was always my dream to teach you how to sew\".  And she replied \"suivoh, you dont even know how to sew\".  \n\nThanks for the laugh.  It will get better.",
            "You\u2019re a very smart young lady. I\u2019m saying this because he wanted you to move in with his roommates and you\u2019d be an illegal tenant most young girls jump at that and it causes issues with the roommates. The issues with your stepbrother is weird and warped asf and your ex definitely has been watching too much stepfamilial porn if he thinks you hanging out with your step brother is some threat to your relationship.",
            "Good on you that type of behaviour screams out Danger, Danger. If he\u2019s going to be that jealous over a family member whom your in quarantine with and demanding that you stop seeing him and face timing him for 3/4 hours a day you were very smart to get out while you could.",
            "Well, that sounds like a happy end to the story. He sounds exhausting. Probably won't learn his mistake for his next relationship, but that's his business.",
            "I'm not usually on the \"red flag, break up\" train, but that was definitely the best call.",
            "Just incase that nutjob left any weird doubts in your mind, the avtivities you described are what my little brother and I do together. I'm married with my own family but when baking my best little helper is my brother. That boy was bad news. Good you dropped him.",
            "You did the right thing. This dude was bad news.",
            "I remember when I use to be similar to your boyfriend. Not to that extent, but definitely wanted control and couldn't handle my own insecurities. Nothing pushes away someone faster than being that way. Its ugly, man. Maturity plays a big role here. Sometimes you're too stuck in your own ways that you fail to see the harm you're causing, and so you think \"if only my significant other will listen everything could be great.\" It's a hard lesson to learn. Although a very important one. One thing that doesnt help your ex is that he has 3 or 4 other guys living with him who are, if I had to guess, constantly telling him \"you need to control your girl bro,\" or \"she definitely has a thing for SB.\" Things along that line. Theres probably not one sensical person confined within those 4 walls which only escalate your ex's insecurities. Leaving was a good decision.",
            "So important that you know you\u2019re not the asshole for blocking him. It\u2019s the smartest thing to do and anyone who cares for you as an objective observer would insist you do that. People like your ex are great at emotional blackmailing and manipulation and making everything seem like it\u2019s your fault. You feel like you have a clear head and 2 min into talking with them you question your actions and wonder if you were wrong. Please don\u2019t unblock him. See this red flag for what it is and find a better guy :)",

            "Good job! I shudder to think of what would have happened if you had moved in with him.",
            "I think you made a good call. It sounds like your BF is jealous and possessive. Anyone demanding that you do anything or telling you who to hang out with is no healthy and it seems like a giant red flag. I have a step brother and we are close, but he's my brother. Eww. Anyone who tried to seperate us or make me feel guilty for spending time with him would be dumped aside because he's family and that's that. Good for you for recognizing the situation for what it is and making the right choice not to move in with him.",
            "You absolutely did the right thing. He wanted you to live with him so he could monitor and control you. If you'd stayed with him, he probably would have turned abusive eventually.",
            "GOOOD JOB. all I gotta say.",
            "Just flip the situation and imagine him going out with his step sister and you stalking on his  instagram, just flip the whole idea and see if you're okay with him doing everything you did. If you're okay with it then you did the right thing and you're not an asshole but if you feel like him doing it is toxic or cheating then I suppose you are.",
            "It\u2019s just really weird that you BF is so jealous of your STEP BROTHER.",
            "Ew, your ex sounds gross. It\u2019s not weird to be friendly with a stepsibling you\u2019ve had for 5 years. Glad you dropped him!",
            "I went into this, just reading the title, kinda understanding where he's coming from, I've had similar insecurities in the past, but... his actions upon those fears were completely irrational, and I agree with everyone else, you dodged a bullet.",
            "Good job! Remain firm. You don't need that kind of toxicity in your life.",
            "Like everyone else said, you made the right decision. Ex was a total possessive jerkwad who definitely is not someone who you should be with, especially during stressful times like these. I hope you\u2019re doing well, much love your way <3",

            "Good for you! Yes, it\u2019s painful to let go of someone you care about, but this is you taking care of yourself. Dealing with jealous partners is EXHAUSTING, SB was just one of many more dudes he would have used to protect his insecurities. He sounds fcking mental tbh. I hope you feel better soon!",
            "Sounds like you made a good decision.",
            "Short answer? No. Not worth it.",
            "Sounds like an insecure kid so you did the right thing.",
            "Smart move. He sounds incredibly insecure and it\u2019s not your \u201cjob\u201d to contatantly reassure him over stupid shit.",

            "Anyone else think the BF is watching too much pornhub with all the step love?",
            "You don't realize how smart you are by asking for space.  He couldn't keep his shit together.  It's your intuition telling you to leave him.  Insecure guys can become dangerous later on down the road if they never improve or seek therapy.  Protect yourself and don't be ashamed about it.",
            "The worst part about this... is that your ex-bf has his head so far up his own ass that he's going to believe you left him for your step brother.\n\nYou did the right thing. It sounds like he needs to grow up before he gets in another relationship.",
            "I had a boyfriend like this. Well done for leaving him but things may get harder. He's going to think that you've left him for your stepbrother - which is so ridiculous. The fact that he doesn't understand that he's family. He'll probably try to reach out to you and pester you a bit. Stay strong and ignore him.\n\nNever let a boy make you feel as your ex did. Trust is such a big thing, good luck!",

There was no way you could properly break up with him without him blowing up and you already had to deal with that when you said you needed space. He had nothing to say that you haven't already heard. Be on the lookout for him trying to contact you in other ways. It would also be okay to say that your ex's jealousy issues were so bad that he kept accusing of trying to cheat on him *with your step-brother*.",
            "Proud of you for sticking to your integrity and not letting your bf (now ex-bf) push you around and be demanding.\n\nOn another note, I think your ex may have been watching too much pornhub step sibling RP. Like..... That shit doesn't really happen IRL lol.\n\nGood for you!",
            "You are absolutely not an asshole for blocking him.  Even relationships that end on good terms can merit blocking to give both parties a bit of space.",
            "I had a situation once where my gf was jealous of her own little sister. Gf was a year older than me, her little sister a year younger. \n\nWhen I got to know them I asked for little sister's number since we were the same age pretty much and I thought it'd help me connect with my gf's family. Gf got pissed and accused me of cheating on her with her own sister. \n\nThing is, this never got better. I understand people can be insecure, hell I'm most of the time, but things like this are too much and should be seen as such.",
            "You go girl. Glad you took the space you needed and made the hard (but sounds like the right) decision when you saw how he responded.",

            "Hey sweetie you did the right thing. He was staying to gaslight you and that's why you feel that way you do.  But in reality you did your self a huge favor because it would of been worse later on in the relationship. You see he asked you to move in to get you away from your comfort zone and then he would turn in to the meanest person you could meet knowing that you have nowhere to go or friends to back you up.",

            "\\>   I did it over text and then blocked him, which probably makes me an asshole \n\nNah, not in this case. You gave him every opportunity to not be a jackass and he wanted to be a jackass. It's not \"being an asshole\" to protect yourself from further jackassery - you know if you'd called him he'd have just turned it into a drama and tried to emotionally blackmail you into staying.",

You already had a one conversation of him screaming down the phone at you so there was realistically a 0% chance he was going to even give you a chance to break up with him over the phone. You should feel proud of yourself for knowing your worth and your boundaries at 19. I hope the rest of your quarantine is filled with baking, driving and time spent with your family.",
            "A reddit success story!  Good job.",
            "It honestly seems like your BF or ex in this case now, was projecting a lot of his own failures and insecurities on you. Like not even having a drivers license and wanting to teach you is stupid. I have a feeling that he was probably cheating & his behavior during this time really shows his true character. \n\nGood job choosing yourself! Stay safe",
            "Thank goodness. Reading your original post and then this one, your situation sounded incredibly similar to the toxic relationship I was in when I was your age.\n\nIt sounded a lot like this guy just wanted to control your every move and couldn't handle you enjoying anything if he wasn't a part of it. Not to mention his projection of cheating on you (and incestuous cheating at that).\n\nMy ex tried to make a similar claim about me and my cousin (she's gay and he knew I'm not straight), and anytime we hung out he thought I would cheat on him. With my cousin. I couldn't have any friends or do anything fun without him. He tried to enforce a minimum daily phone call time on me, even when I was living in a dorm and trying to make time for homework. I had to plan my whole day around him and his expectations \n\nLuckily I eventually wised up and realized he was mentally and emotionally abusive, and I'm glad you did too. Now you can go forward and recognize toxic habits and put your foot down about not tolerating them.\n\nThis is a great opportunity for you to grow and spread your wings. Best of luck to you!",

He was happy in the past because he had you constantly in his sights. \n\nTime to move on and enjoy life :) \n\nYou got this! Break ups are hard, and it will hurt a lot, but over time it won't hurt as frequently.",
            "Goddamn. You know I sometimes find that commenters overreact when they so and so abusive or something like that, and/or you need to break up immediately. But in this case your bf is a lunatic. He\u2019s the weird one for imagining you and your SB like that, and he\u2019s possessive as hell. Like I know constantly FaceTiming personally isn\u2019t my thing, but reading everything you guys do was exhausting. On top of that I don\u2019t get how he gets disgusted by you being around SB when your also with your family, yet he wanted you to move in with four OTHER guys and him. If SB was weird with you like he thinks, obviously you would tell your bf, but since you don\u2019t think so, it mean your bf has trust issues with you. I want to lean toward you guys breaking up, but obviously it\u2019s your choice and you should do it at your pace since it\u2019s your relationship.\nAlso, it\u2019s not you choosing SB over him, that\u2019s ridiculous. You\u2019re being rational.\nEdit: I see that you guys actually broke up. Good for you!",

This boy wanted to control you and you decided to not be a victim to that. Good for you! Many of us had to learn about people like him the hard way.",

So many people ignore red flags because things were so good before these bad things reared their heads and  that's just not who they think the person is. But when somebody shows you who they are, you need to believe them and you did. Great job standing up for yourself. You are not a possession to be controlled. You are a human who is allowed to have relationships with the opposite sex, whether you're related or not.   \n\n\nI truly believe that this controlling behavior would have escalated were you to accept his outrageous demands and you would have been in a very bad place. You definitely dodged a bullet and maybe even saved your life.",

Also it was his dream to teach u to drive when you're already learning? Again wtf that's weird, teaching another person to drive is stressful af and it's also better to learn from someone whos been on the road for a few years. Anyway keep ya head up and stay safe!",
            "I\u2019m glad you saw through all of this. The point of you moving in was to isolate you. That way he can control you. Same way he wanted you to wait on the car driving- again if you wait for him it\u2019s all at his control if and when you learn to drive. Imagine he got annoyed about something he made up in his head and decided he wasn\u2019t going to teach you! Gross.\n\nHe just sounds like a child to be honest. Controlling too.

            "If he gets jealous of your stepbrother he definitly watches way too much porn. Very sad, but he seems\nto need to figure a couple of things out for himself. He shouldn\u2019t believe he can make someone happy if he\u2019s a pile of garbage himself, init?",
            "> I did it over text and then blocked him, which probably makes me an asshole, but I literally couldn\u2019t deal with anymore of him yelling at me and insulting my family.\n\nIt doesn't make you an asshole.  I generally consider breaking up over text a big no, but that doesn't apply when there are specific friction that makes other alternatives unreasonable.",
            "Yes you did the right thing! I wanted to comment on the other post but wasn\u2019t able to. I had an ex who was exactly like your boyfriend. He was jealous of every male in my life, whether I was related to them or not, he was fucking jealous. He even one time accused me of liking my brother! (Eww!!!) He was so insecure with himself that he became manipulative of my life and tried to control everything about me! from what I wore, to who I could talk to (which was *only* him)! It was an abusive relationship and so was yours. Glad you got out there! A real boyfriend wouldn\u2019t be threatened by a fucking family member for crying out loud.",
            "Jesus christ... please do not ever get back together with this guy, he sounds super paranoid and insecure. Good job breaking up with him. You made the right call. If only he understood that he created a problem where there was none.",
            "Omg just cringed and skipped to the tldr, yea thank fuck you broke up with that desperate, needy, pathetic, insecure little boy",
            "Sorry this happened but as someone else said, it's a silver lining the shower you earlier what he's like. \n\nHonestly, I'm kind of curious what the SB thinks about all this, given he's involved in some part (mainly just by being there).",
            "Regardless of your feelings of sadness, if when you break up with someone you feel any type of relief, hold onto that because that means you made a good decision.",
            "Only u can take yr decision. \nYr BF appears to be very controlling.\nU may love him. But does he respect yr feelings, opinions, etc? Reflect over the past experience. Can u sustain such interaction into the future? For how long?",
            "I don't judge you for breaking up over text. After his abhorrent behavior, I can't say it's undeserved, considering he would have probably just shouted more abuse at you.",
            "Tbh it looks like you came out of this with a new, awesome friend in SB and got rid of some dead weight. Best to find all this out now rather than down the road.",
            "You most definitely dodged a bullet there. Humongous crimson flag right there. Also don't be sad. A relationship with someone is supposed to make you happy and bring you peace, and not become the reason for perpetual headache. Well done.",
            "oh god I'm so happy you posted this\n\nWell done (he WAS super controlling)",
            "Good thing you left your BF. I read the original and there was alot of insecure shit there that he needs to deal with. Getting jealous over your step brother and you spending time together; and then worrying about you and him getting romantically involved. Dude had some serious issues to deal with.",
            "You dodged a bullet on this one.",
            "I\u2019m married and I don\u2019t think we have ever spent 3-4 hours talking. He\u2019s a young guy, and for some reason young guys are super controlling, jealous, angry, and insecure",
            "Excellent decision-making. You will find someone better - best of luck!",
            "Okay, I know people tend to have a different relationship with step siblings than fill siblings, but your boyfriend is insane. He does realise that it's your BROTHER that he's jealous of, right? It sounds like someone's been watching too much step-sister porn and got themself a problem.",
            "You ex was spending too much time on the step-brother category of porn hub.",
            "I feel like your ex has watched too much step brother porn and thinks that is the default when it comes to blended families.\n\nQuarantine is forcing relationships to reevaluate things for better or worse.",
            "TBF i had a good feeling about you the second you looked at moving in with 4 dudes and one bathroom and said \u201cnah\u201d. \n\nThis guy comes across as woefully immature he thinks getting to bone regularly makes up for you squatting in his crusty bachelor palace.",
            "I felt exhausted just reading about this dude. Holy hell, what a drain. \n\nGood riddance.",
            "Sounds like your ex watches too much pornhub lol",
            "OP, I want you to know how proud I am of you for sticking up for yourself and your SB. A lot of people can't see how bad of a situation they're in and I'm glad you were able to!",
            "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 these are red flags. Due to your age & circumstances, you may not have noticed them before. This guy has absolutely zero rights to demand anything from you...let\u2019s just get that straight. No other person does. The fact is, he is immature, insecure & very possessive. Don\u2019t equate his jealousy for love. Someone who loves you would not treat you this way. Be grateful for Covid-19 insofar as you don\u2019t have to be around this guy. He is testing how he can control you, do NOT give in to any of his ridiculous demands & as far as his theories on your SB & you, was he raised in Alabama? I would be breaking it off with him & be grateful you have dodged a bullet. You deserve much, much better than someone like that.",
            "That doesn't make you an asshole hun, seems to me the asshole is the one wanting you to choose him over your family.. Insecurities of that proportion would be a sign that maybe he needs a psychiatric evaluation lol",
            "You did the smart thing.  Your ex watches too much incest porn.",
            "Damn, this is some abusive behavior, i'm glad you leave him, most of these threads are people not wanting to let go.",
            "I know it's hard and it hurts, but you did absolutely the right thing. You can't fix his way of thinking and hurting you, which would likely never end if you continue.",
            "You're not an asshole. This man sounded completely unreasonable and overwhelmed with his own insecurities, and you weren't going to be able to make him see the errors in his actions. I'm so sorry this is how it had to end for you two, but good luck in the future, and you made the right call.",
            "Nope. There are much better men in the world",
            "I'm so glad that you did what was best for you! It took me two horrible controlling relationships, back to back, to realize  that those weren't healthy or normal.",
            "In a normal break up yes blocking him is immature but Iin your case he insists on emotionally berating you so it is in your best health to block him.",
            "You aren't an asshole for blocking him.  You're smart for doing so.  He thinks you're cheating on him with your stepbrother because he can't fathom you being anything other than an object of affection.",
            "You dodged a bullet there!",
            "He probably watches too many SB/SS porn. Good for you! You dodged a bullet and you did the right thing!",
            "Your not an asshole. You can't do it face to face and this was best for you. He was trying to manipulate you and was being very unreasonable. How is teaching to drive and bake bread boyfriend tasks?! My mom taught me both, that's family thing. Plus considering he doesn't have his permit he probably is either making it up to try to guilt you or lives in his head. I know it hurts but you did the best thing for you.",
            "You aren't the asshole for blocking him. Infact you are an inspiration and a scholar.\n Trust me I was just like him. \nI was controlling, insecure, scared, always angry always gas lighting and arguing and making myself be the victim. I'd make her feel so guilty that she would feel sad for me even though I started the argument. I had no respect. No trust. No empathy. Nothing for her. The only thing that would make me feel better was making somebody else feel bad. After many failed relationships and years of counseling I realized I had deeper issues to deal with. After I faced and took care of my personal issues I treated women how they should and genuinely felt real feelings. Been with my girl for 12 years couldn't be happier. I'm not even scared to let her be alone with  guy friends. We trust each other. \nNo means trust no relationship. Point blank",
            "With this type of dipshit a text break up and block is exactly what they need.",
            "Well done OP. Don't go back there, he sounds like the persistent type and will try his best to lure you in. You are much better off without the toxic influence on your life.",
            "Good job, hope he stops watching step-sis/step-bro pornos.",
            "Here OP, you dropped this. \n\ud83d\udea9.. \nor maybe about 20.",
            "You broke up with him in the right way.",
            "He's probably been spending too much time on pornhub",
            "Such a narcissist. \nEwww stay away",
            "I\u2019m so sorry things had to turn out that way, but you made the right decision. I\u2019m so glad you were level-headed about the situation, listened to some of the good advice people gave, and went with your gut. You\u2019re smart and strong, and you\u2019ll be so much better off not being controlled or having a situation that creates so much anxiety, especially with everything else going on.",
            "Honestly I think you did the right thing.\n\nMy opinion probably doesn't matter, but it sounded a lot like your BF was a malignant narcissist, he needed everything to be about him, the second it wasn't he got uncomfortable or angry.",
            "Blocking him does not make you an asshole at all - you\u2019re taking care of yourself. Please make sure to stay safe - people who are controlling are often the most dangerous after a breakup. Reach Love is Respect or a professional if some sort to create a plan to stay safe, physically and mentally!",
            "You handled that perfectly!",
            ">I\u2019ve been crying a lot, but I\u2019m also kind of relieved\n\nIf his absence brings you peace, then it's good you broke up.",
            "Definitely made the right choice by breaking up with him. He clearly has a lot of issues (trust, anger, control, etc...) I think you saved your future self from a doomed ending, that honestly could have gotten REALLY bad/ potentially physically abusive. You go girl \ud83d\udc81\ud83d\udc81\ud83d\udc81\ud83d\udc81",
            "You dodged a bullet, good job OP",
            "You 100% did the right thing. Be proud of yourself! Sometimes you might regret this decision and cry about it, I get that. It's a part of breaking up. But never ever ever forget that this kind of behavior is NEVER acceptable. You deserve someone so much better than him. And I truly hope that you'll find that person one day. You totally did the right thing and that was really brave of you. Take care",
            "In no way are you the asshole- you *never* need to continue toxic, controlling relationships, no matter the circumstances. \n\nTake some time to be yourself, and move forward. This was just a learning experience.",
            "Dumping the BF was the right choice, he probably wants to fuck your step brother tho",
            "Yeah he sounds controlling and jealous. Your step brother is family. Anyone you date should understand this.",
            "Isnt it funny how we create the very hell we feared in the first place? This guy was so insecure over losing you that he lost you. Not because you wanted to leave him either, like he made this happen all on his own when his deep emotional fears were screaming for him to hold on tighter. I dont know I think people on reddit are way to harsh- we are emotional creatures and insecurities suck. I kinda feel sorry for the guy.",
            "Your ex was obsessive and crazy insecure! Seriously, accusing you of having something more with your stepbrother? That's such a sick thought to have, no matter how old you guys were when you became family. You are *family*. He was trying to make you question your relationship with every man that wasn't him and eventually isolate you to escalate his controlling behaviors so it would be harder for you to leave. That's a really messed-up situation to be in that a lot of women find themselves in and you just barely missed it. I'm happy you were able to stop for a second and think things through. As time passes by the relief you feel will only increase.",
            "[removed]",
            "I get everyone's thoughts but reddit is as always quite \"yeah breakup! great!\" But it's quite easy for him feel that way when you're with your stepbrother and don't see him during quarantine. Hard on someone who's maybe alone? Obviously it's not correct and from your perspective that's clear. But from his he's alone and his girlfriend is spending time with some other dude every day while he fears losing connection to you. I think you guys just needed to get through that accusing. Two options: either he realizes that he's not actually mad about you spending time with your stepbrother or you manage to get to him through that making sure that he knows that that won't make him lose connection and there's enough stuff that you guys can do together once the quarantine thing is over",
            "I guess he is the insecure type. And not having you around due to quarantine made him very anxious.  That anxiety made him paranoid.To deal with those anxiety ,he started to find things that justified his worry. So he can find someone to blame. So he can ease his feeling.  I'll say he is very immature emotionally. And to you that is very frustrating. But you can't expect him to grow overnight. Amd I do believe he can learn if you willing to teach him and be there for him.I'm not saying you have to. just saying he can change.",
            "Normally I would have given the benefit of the doubt... but he needed to learn from this.\n\nI would say the healthiest thing to do for everyone (assuming he doesn\u2019t have a history of being manipulative) is to give him the chance to talk to you again so that you can make sure he knows how you felt and why things went the way they did. Maybe from that he can grow and you can feel at ease knowing he isn\u2019t confused. If he\u2019s not willing to listen, however, of course, don\u2019t give him the chance. Just make sure your reaching out is just a chance to explain things, and do your best to make sure he knows that too.\n\nYou made the right decision and things will get easier. Maybe in time he will change as a person and you\u2019ll be able to get back together without any of the problems you\u2019ve been facing. But if he doesn\u2019t change, then you may have gotten away from a much bigger problem that you may not know about now. But, honestly, I wouldn\u2019t expect many people to change out of being very controlling, presumptuous, untrusting, and disrespectful very well.",
