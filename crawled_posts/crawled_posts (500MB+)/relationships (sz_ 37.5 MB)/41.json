        "selftext": "My wife (34F) and I (36M) have been together for 5 years, married for 3, and have no children.  For our first few years together, she was a full time attorney working 50-60 hours per week.  At that time, her income was approximately 40% higher than mine.  The income disparity did not bother me at all (I mean, who doesn\u2019t like more money\u2026 hah!), but neither of us was happy about the amount of hours she had to spend at work.  When we met, she was already pretty burnt out and unhappy with the stressful job.  I tried my best to be supportive and encourage her to look for other jobs that would be less stressful.  She was open to it, but knew it would be a big pay cut.  She said she would rather stick it out for a while longer so we could pay off her student loans and save money for a new house.\n\nOnce the loans were gone and we had moved into our new home, she found a part-time (\\~15 hrs/wk) job working from home doing something more in line with her interests.  Her stress level went way down, and so did her income.  She still makes very good money, but her income is about a third of her previous job.  This is absolutely not a problem financially.  My income has steadily increased and she\u2019s still bringing in plenty.  We are doing great and have no money problems.  I have no regrets about any of it.\n\nThe thing is, every once in a while, she\u2019ll mention that she feels sad that she doesn\u2019t \u201ccontribute\u201d because her income is so much lower than mine.  I tell her this is absolutely not true.  Not only does she still have great income, but she contributes in so many other ways.  Since she has a very flexible work schedule, she is able to do most of the household chores, takes care of errands during the day, does a lot of the shopping, etc.  She basically keeps our household running.  But I think in her mind, the work she does for our household does not make up for the loss in income.\n\nShe recently found out we are eligible for health insurance through one of her attorney organization memberships.  She sent me the details, but it turned out that our current plan we have through my job is still a better deal.  I texted her and said I looked into it but we should stick with what we have.  When I got home from work, I could tell she was feeling down.  She told me she had gotten excited at the possibility that we could use something through her work and that she would be providing something major.  She was crushed when I told her we shouldn\u2019t use it.  I felt terrible\u2026\n\nI\u2019m sure part of the problem is that when we met, she was independent and doing very well on her own.  I think she now feels like she has become dependent on my income, and that makes her feel bad.  Also, she went from working 60 hours/week to around 15.  So she has much more extra time to enjoy life, but I think she feels guilty about it.  I\u2019ve told her many times that the money is not important to me, she contributes so much more than a paycheck, and I\u2019m much happier now that we can spend more time together.  I think she understands that, but she is still hard on herself about it.  She\u2019s not a money-grubbing person, but she has said she often thinks about all the money she has given up by quitting her high paying job and how much better off we would be financially if she stayed there.  But, luckily, she remembers how awful the work was and knows she does not want to go back to such a stressful job.\n\nI was wondering if anyone might have some advice on how I can make her feel better about her contributions to our relationship.  She knows that I\u2019m so much happier with our current situation, but she still has issues with it internally.  I don\u2019t know what else to do other than to keep telling her how much better things are now, even with less income.  If anyone has experienced this (on either side), I\u2019d love to hear how you dealt with it.\n\nThank you!\n\nTLDR: My wife\u2019s income decreased quite a bit.  While we are doing fine financially, she said she often feels sad that she doesn\u2019t contribute as much anymore and feels that she has become dependent on me.  I\u2019m looking for advice on how to convince her that she contributes more than her fair share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I wanted to say thank you so much for all of the replies! Also, there are a couple of questions I figured I\u2019d try to explain here:\n\nWhy did she cut her hours down so drastically (60/wk to 15/wk)? \n\nWhile she was working at her old job, we decided we wanted to start a family. The ideal situation was for her to get a low-hour, flexible, work-from-home job so she could be a stay at home mom with a little bit of income on the side. This job popped up and it seemed almost perfect for us. Unfortunately, the baby has not come as quickly as we had hoped (which we knew was a possibility). So we are kind of in limbo where she doesn\u2019t want to quit her current job or start a new full-time job because she could get pregnant at any time. \n\nCan she increase her hours from 15 to XX? \n\nWithout going into much detail, her job essentially gives her \u201ctasks\u201d each week. They vary in difficulty, but usually take her about 6-7 hours each. She normally gets two a week, but occasionally they have an extra for her. Unfortunately, her employer does not have enough tasks to steadily give her 3+ each week. So she\u2019s kind of maxed out where she\u2019s at. They are flexible in that she can request to only get one (or even zero for a short time) task a week.",

            "I'd also remind her that there's more to \"contributing\" to the relationship than just money. I had a job some time back where I earned a great living, but the stress levels were so high that I literally had panic attacks some days! I eventually left that situation for my own sanity, and now I'm in a place where I earn less, but I'm so much happier. \n\nThe lower stress made it so I could be a better husband and father. That was (and is) worth so much more than money!\n\nHealth (and mental health) >>> money.",
            "Communication is key, so in your shoes, I\u2019d try reminding her of the things you said here.\n\nThere are many more ways to contribute outside of financially and it sounds like she\u2019s awesome at it.\n\nMy advice would be to make sure you\u2019re verbally appreciative and hopefully this will help her feel better.",
            "Can she volunteer her legal skills to a charity and a cause that she cares about?\n\nIt might not bring in more income but it could provide her with a sense of fulfillment to get her through this career change.",
            "Perhaps she would benefit from seeing a therapist for a little while. Such a major change in income and working hours (especially if it was very important to her /felt like part of her identity) could feel a bit like a loss of self.",

            "You say she keeps the household running by doing all the errands - how about increasing verbal affirmation of these things so she feels like she is contributing? Saying things like \"wow, did you clean? The house looks amazing\" or if she cooks \"wow this meal is great, I really love coming home to a hot meal\" might help her realize she is truly contributing. It isn't your fault at all that she feels this way, but maybe it could help if you went out of your way to help her realize that that is not true.\n\nI also read that you plan on having a child soon - she may feel differently once she is busy raising a baby. It sounds like you two really love each other and you sound like you care a lot about her happiness, which is very sweet! I hope in time your wife will realize that money is not the only contribution you can make to a household.",
            "Going from a 50-60 hour lawyer job to 15 hrs/week is a huge change in life style and also mental stimulation/challenge that housework can\u2019t replace. This maybe unpopular opinion but your wife needs to find a job that challenges her more and leaves her feeling validated and honestly that keeps her more occupied. If her current job was truly keeping making her feel validated and like she has a purpose, she wouldn\u2019t feel the way she does, regardless of the money. An idle mind finds a way to cut itself to shreds fixating on things. House hold chores cannot be purpose enough for people with active minds, especially with no kids. I\u2019m not going to tell you to tell her to find a hobby because that\u2019s super patronizing and a waste of potential. Tell her she needs to work more hours in this thing that she says she likes. Or else, search for a full time job that gives her balance and allows her to meet her professional /life goals. She obviously needed a break to recover from her demanding job, it\u2019s now time to figure out the next step. Good luck.",
            "My husband gave up his soul-destroying but high-paid attorney job when I started making enough money to support us and after going solo for a while, is now a full time SAHD.  I can tell he has some of the same feelings even though I totally support him staying home.  \n\nI suspect there are a lot of things tied up in this beyond just wanting to feel \"productive\".  She's probably gotten a lot of validation along the way for being smart and hardworking and \"doing something\" challenging like law.  If you have a lot of your self-image tied up in your work, as a lot of people in prestigious careers do, it can be hard to lose that external validation, especially if she's got friends who are still in law or medicine or whatever.  \n\nSimilarly, giving up career/income is a high-risk choice for people, especially women.   It certainly can be the right choice, as it has been for us, and it sounds like you have a strong marriage, but every woman has heard stories about someone who was home with the kids for 20+ years and whose marriage broke down unexpectedly leaving her 15 years from retirement with no real prospects for making more than a bare-bones income.   She's still working, but would she be able to support herself and your kids if you died, or if you guys divorced?  It can be hard for people to articulate those thoughts to a spouse they love and are happy with. \n\n In any case, I think teasing out the real reasons may be helpful for her to strategize solutions.  Like, it won't help for her to keep a time sheet of how much time she spends on doing the dishes or taking the kids to activities if the underlying issue is \"I don't feel that I'm using my brain\" or \"I feel like my friends look down on me\" or \"I'm worried that I've fallen off a 'career' trajectory and can't get back on.\"",
            "Did she not like the job of being an attorney itself or the place/ type of law that she practiced? What I\u2019m getting at is I think there are options where she could utilize her degrees while working less. Otherwise seeing a therapist may help",
            "If you have a job that makes you happy, remind her of that, like a lot.\n\nShe might feel bad about you working more hours, but if you're doing something you love, or fulfils you in other ways besides the paycheck, the balance might be really different for you.\n\nLike if you don't need an hour each day to decompress when you get home, or need to do a list of things to manage your stress, you have a lot more free time left that's actually free for you to enjoy. \n\nIf that doesn't work, you could always calculate how much outsourcing the chores she does would cost. If you add up cleaning services, private chef (if she cooks), getting your laundry done etc she might be saving the household a lot more then she thinks. If she objects and tells you 'but I'm home anyway', tell her you *would* need to outsource it if she was working 60 hours to maintain the same quality of life.",
            "Personally I would recommend that you consider getting a kitten or puppy if that\u2019s something you guys are interested in, because it literally would not be possible if she wasn\u2019t at home most of the time. Gives her a friend, a sense of purpose, a cure for the boredom, etc.",
            "This is just me shooting from the hip but I am an attorney and recent law school graduate and law school/ law practice kinda indoctrinates you into the idea that your worth comes from extrinsic factors that other people recognize as valuable e.g. grades/law review, salary, job at prestigious firm.  Before law school I could give a crap about what other people thought of me/ how I stacked up compared to them, but during and post law school I kind of struggle with whether I am up to snuff with my peers comparatively.  I'm not saying this is the case with your wife as I don't know her.  In my experience finance is a simple metric to compare yourself with other people and see how you are progressing in life.  I could argue that there are other things that are more informative than a person's income as a comparative factor; however, that assumes that value can only be realized from exceeding one's peers.  Life is finite, if earning the most amount of money possible allows you to get the most enjoyment out of life by all means pursue it (morally).  However, if there are benefits from not earning the most possible a person shouldn't view that as a personality failing but rather as a courageous act of choosing to spend finite time in the way that brings the most actual benefit.  If you sacrifice those benefits  for additional money to buy substitute pleasures ultimately you lose out on the ability to enjoy those benefits forever. (because you only live once).  This is not being selfish as working long hours in a job one doesn't like could pose a detriment to a person's health and relationships.  She is not depriving your family of additional money but rather insulating the family from spending, money, time, and emotional resources dealing with the physical and mental consequences of having a miserable family member.",
            "feeling guilty about productivity is a capitalist mindset that needs to be challenged every time it comes up. Individual therapy will help her separate her value as an employee and help her value herself as a human being without having to be a type a income provider.\n\nmy partner is disabled, chronically ill, cant find work and he definitely struggles with the productivity myth. I just remind him i value him as a person, as long as hes doing something hes ambitious about something, i dont care if it makes money.

            "I would definitely advise to work in her outlook before having a baby. It sounds like being a high earner was part of her identify - something she prided herself on. It\u2019s also advice that\u2019s often given to women - to ensure you\u2019re self-sufficient financially & not dependent on a man, etc. (I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s right or the only way to arrange finances, just that it\u2019s something that might\u2019ve been drilled into her head.) So now, even though she logically understands that this dynamic is working for your family, she may be struggling with who she is now that she\u2019s no longer the \u201chigh earner\u201d & is only able to take this paycut / new job because you\u2019re becoming the \u201chigh earner\u201d & she can lean on you for that. So the reason I\u2019m saying to take this very seriously before having a kid is because she\u2019s going to move even further from \u201chigh earner\u201d to \u201ctraditional female gender role,\u201d which may really test her mentally if she\u2019s not done processing this, even if she again logically understands that this is the best arrangement for your family.",

            "Has she read those articles about people's biggest regrets at the end of their life? Almost all of them say they wish they had worked less and spent more time with loved ones.

            "As an attorney, I'm guessing she was billed by the hour, so she knows that time = money. Maybe try to let her know that to you - and that you're hoping eventually she'll feel the same way - the value of the time she is spending stressing less, doing work she actually enjoys, keeping your household up and running, and spending more time with on herself/with you is worth far more than any amount she was or could be paid as an attorney. Remind her that her time and her effort are worth more than just dollars and cents, but that in the grand scheme of things her life and your lives together have far more value even with the decreased household earnings if she feels more content with what she has gotten done at the end of the day, whether that be personally or professionally. I think even having being burnt out, it may take her a while to get out of the mindset of being ambitious just in terms of corporate/financial status. Maybe see if she would be interested in speaking to a counselor or therapist to get to the bottom of those feelings? \n\nWhatever the outcome, it sounds like she has a great and supportive partner by her side to get through this. Best of luck to both of you!",
            "There are a lot of good suggestions here, but maybe one thing you could look up that may make her feel better about her monetary contributions to the household would be how much her household tasks would cost if she wasn't doing it? One big one is childcare which can be very very expensive (you mentioned you are going to start a family soon) but also you could look at what it would cost if you hired someone to do laundry and cleaning, the cost of eating out vs her cooking, grocery delivery, etc.\n\nThis is kinda a small thing but maybe knowing she's doing work that is worth $XXX per month would make her feel better.",
            "It sounds like she's spent a long time treating money as a goal, so maybe a good way to get through to her is to get her to consider and set new goals and purposes. It's a good idea to do that as a couple and as individuals. The level 10 life framework is a great one to start with. This way when she starts thinking about \"I should\", you can point her back to her life goals, and she can decide what her priorities are.\n\nAlso, if she doesn't have ptsd from it as a lawyer, get her to start time tracking again. Chances are she'll realize her billable hours = current working hours + housework + errands.",
            "List to Boba Fett on this one: she's no good to you dead.\n\nSeriously, though. You're married. Legally as well as morally, you are both equal partners in the marriage.

            "I looked into everyone responses and they are GREAT! As they say she should look into volunteering to get her mind occupied, I think it is the best thing to do. On the other hand, they also gave you multiple choices in making her feel better: calculate how much money you would spend on hiring someone to clean, do the dishes, etc... and how much you would spend eating outside If she was not here, as well as increasing verbal affirmation towards the job she does in your house.\n\nPersonally, I would add one little thing more. Communication in times like this is the key, and I would advise you to change the way you approach the \"back home talk\". Usually people ask \"What did you do today?\" which in your case might make your wife feel as though she doesn't have as much to talk about as you. Try using one of those:\n\n\\- What made you happy today?  What was the best part of your day?\n\n\\- What challenge did you have that you overcame? what was a success you had today?\n\n\\- What made you angry today? Did you give anyone the side-eye today? Why?\n\n\\- Did you listen/watch/read anything interesting today?\n\n\\- What made you laugh today?\n\nI don't know if it will help, but maybe you should give it a shot!

            "My SO went through something similar and so did I. Career burnout is real. We both took turns being SATP for a bit too and we're both back to earning well again.\n\nThe fact is, a burnt out, stressed out SO is worse than a happy with with lower income. \n\nWe are more than just a paycheck to our SOs and that's something you need to remind her of the fact. \n\nThat her contributions now to your life don't have a price tag and contribute to the long term health and happiness of your family unit which seriously, money can't buy. \n\nBUT \n\nAs a career minded individual she can also be having personal hangups around not feeling as successful, being a \"quitter\" etc. She needs to unpick those things separately from her contributions to your domestic bliss.\n\nMy SO was the first one to get burn out and a huge part of getting them to slow down was getting over the idea that they were a quitter or that they were failing at life. Even the mental health break they took was racked with guilt around the same thing.\n\nLuckily when I took my career break I could reconfigure what I was feeling because I went through the same feelings of inadequacy despite spending all this time comforting my SO when they were going through that.\n\nWe live in such a society that puts equates financial contribution to worth. Now everybody should be pulling their weight but it doesn't have to be financial. \n\nIf you say she's running the household and taking that load off you, that's so invaluable to your mental health and quality of life that you wouldn't have if it wasn't for her. Might be worth reinforcing how much worse off you'd be without her there to take care of this stuff.",
            "On a practical level, how are you managing finances? Nothing says equal-contribution like pooling your money into a joint account and paying yourselves equally in terms of personal spending money. If you insist on paying for everything, you're actually reducing her autonomy and exerting a form of control. If you truly value her contributions equally to your own, then you'll be happy pooling your income.\n\nOn an emotional level, I sense a lot of caring, but not so much understanding in your post. I am reading between the lines here, but \"not contributing\" sounds like a probably a proxy for loss of status or fulfillment.\n\n>But I think in her mind, the work she does for our household does not make up for the loss in income.\n\nDude, that's not just in her mind. That's societal values.\n\nShe was the primary bread-winner, and now that she's earning a fraction of what she was, she feels as though she's pulling less weight. Furthermore, housework is a poor substitute for a high-flying career, and those contributions are far from equivalent when it comes to one's sense of self-worth.\n\nThe first thing to understand is that her feelings are completely reasonable, and to empathise with them. *Obviously* it's fine for you, you're now the primary breadwinner and have the status that comes with that. What's more, you've gained this status without having to work a job you hate. But for her, she will feel less in control than she was previously.\n\nIf she feels that she's not contributing, it could be because of how you're making her feel. By this I don't mean explicit things like \"I earn the money so I decide how to spend it\", I mean little things like telling her about your hard day at work, while she did her few hours and maybe swept the floor. Your reassurances here can actually make things worse, because their tone can tacitly acknowledge the disparity.\n\nYou have to accept though, that maybe there's nothing you could do to fix this but listen. The main probably is that her new role is not making her feel fulfilled, and you need to listen to this and help her figure out what to do, rather than offer suggestions that have crossed her mind already.\n\nBut sort the finances first.",
            "Sorry for the long comment, but I completely relate to this. I was an attorney at a couple fairly large firms for about a dozen years. Eventually my boss became insufferable as she gained more power within, her favorite associate was always trying to throw me under the bus, and I had three boys in four years (not necessarily recommended). I could barely work a full day what with the kids always needing something and daycare was $3300 a month anyway for all three, so I quit.\n\nAs soon as I quit, I felt like I wasn't contributing. I couldn't keep the house clean because the boys would immediately destroy everything. I felt I had to watch them 24 hours a day because I wasn't working a paying job. Someone was always up during the night. I became depressed. Started day drinking heavily. I felt like I had no structure anymore. I had always worked, always brought in nearly as much as my husband. Now I felt I had to ask him permission to buy things for myself. \n\nPoint being, even though our situations are a bit different, I totally  get understand her thought process. She may have to work it out for herself over time. Regardless of what my husband said, I still felt the way I felt. Like I said, I had always made my own money and was never dependent. It has taken me two years (and an alcohol detox, which felt particularly shameful) to see that my high stress job didn't determine my value. I guess what really changed things for me was when my husband got a remote job and we moved from California to Germany. He is home so much more - although working - and he really sees how much I run around all day. That gave me some gratification. I'm getting there. Your wife will too! And she is still working, even! \n\nTL;DR: I quit my job and felt useless even though I was taking care of three tiny boys. I think your wife's reaction is pretty normal, especially for someone who worked as an attorney at a firm for years. Law firm culture is a very particular thing. When you're used to billing every six minutes of your day, not having to do so anymore can actually make you feel adrift. (But we can still complain about putting in our time.)",
            "I'm also a 34 year old female attorney. I recently left my private practice and returned to government work. So believe me I can relate. Here is some perspective and if your wife wants to reach out to me directly I'm cool with that. \n\nThere is a mentality within our profession that if you aren't busting your ass 80 hours a week and earning 6 figures, you're a failure and a nobody. This is especially true for women as law is still a GOB profession and we are held to higher standards. Perception is everything in a career field that literally requires you to have a good reputation to be able to bring in clients and make money. This attitude can easily bleed over from career into home life.\n\nThis mentality is likely what is causing her to feel that her non-monetary contributions are not enough. I totally understand.\n\nShe might consider joining some groups or organizations that have nothing to do with law. Young professionals, sports club, brunch group, book club, etc. Perhaps seeing other people happy with lives and schedules similar to hers will encourage her to be more accepting of her own.\n\nI'm not sure if she was salaried or commission-based at her law firm. Commission based work is tough because its feast or famine. If this was the case for her, perhaps suggest to her that it is more valuable to have a STEADY  guaranteed income than a higher (or potentially higher) income.\n\nAlso remind her that she is saving the household money by taking care of chores and errands and such. If she wasn't able to do these things, you would have to pay for grocery delivery or pay for a maid and landscaper. Maybe even look into what these things cost in your area so you can show her how much money she is saving your household.\n\nI wish her all the best in her new career and adapting to life outside of the private practice grind!",

Doubling her hours would bring in quite a bit more money it sounds like, but she's still be working half as much as she used to be.\n\nDoes she have goals for herself? Maybe she's still stuck in the mindset of her old goals that had her working as an attorney and she needs to define new goals for this new lifestyle she's chosen?",
            "In our house we said it\u2019s a time contribution, not money. My wife and I have swapped who makes more several times, but we\u2019ve always said if we are both working 40 hours we are equal, if one person is averaging 38, they have 2 hours to contribute",
            "Maybe she went from one extreme too much to the other extreme. It's okay for her to want to do some other productive things besides the household. Maybe she can work 30ish hours instead of 15? I mean, 15 is really little. I would also feel useless if I worked so little, are you sure you didn't talk her into this a bit too much?\n\nEdit: after reading your replies I want to ask you, are you not going to work less to take care of your baby together? That way the weight would be more evenly distributed",
            "If you guys like animals, maybe you guys should look into fostering animals, it will help her be busy and actually see her work progress and it would help the animals be in a loving environment.",
            "Push her to work more than 15 hours a week. Something she really enjoys doing. Fills the time!",
            "So, maybe its not just giving back to the household but utilizing her knowledge and stuff?  Depending on the type of law she practices, there are a lot of opportunities for helping underprivileged folks get expungements, help people and non-profits navigate detailed tax law, ect.  There is also an organization called 80,000 hours that has some good opportunities for people who are high knowledge but kinda burned out.",
            "I don't have any advice but just wanted to say it sounds like you guys have a great and loving relationship and care about each other very much!",
            "I would say volunteer work may really be helpful for her. \n\nI must say though your concern for her is so sweet!",
            "It sounds to me like your wife has a lot of time to get stuck in her mind. \n\nIt can create continuous loops and the mind has a great way of playing tricks if you don't actively use tools to stop it from doing so. Those thoughts aren't real, the feeling of not doing enough or earning enough isn't true and your wife's brain is inventing toxic thoughts because she has suddenly got a lot of time to think and not a lot to think about. \n\nShe might find that listening to audio books or podcasts through the day is useful.\n\nI changed my toxic thoughts patterns by doing this. Whenever I notice a thought about not being, doing, or earning 'enough', I visualise a stop sign in my head and turn on a book or podcast to focus my attention on. I can drift in and out of thinking about different things, but I no longer allow myself to dwell on pointless toxic thoughts.\n\nIt took me a bit of practise, but now it comes as second nature.",
            "It probably feels very vulnerable for her. She was used to providing and being independent and now in a way she\u2019s become dependent. \n\nContinue to provide positive praise for the good things this new job brought: she is happier and has more quality time for the marriage, those are an invaluable contribution in themselves.",
            "I think boredom and lack of a challenge can be a big part of the issue here, especially if she used to get some of her identity and self-satisfaction from her career.\n\nI made a similar move myself last year. I made six figures and was responsible for about 65% of our household income. At the same time, I was running a non-profit, volunteering at our church and handling everything that involves life with four teenagers. I was totally burnt out.\n\nMy husband landed a fabulous new job with a huge pay raise and encouraged me to \"take a break.\" I scaled down my business to almost nothing... And my income dropped accordingly.\n\nFor a few months, I reveled in life as an at-home mom, and worked on scaling up my non-profit. But the reality is, even scaling up my non-profit only takes up so much time. We invest in rental properties, so I took over management and a lot of the renovation work on those. It's a fun challenge, and while it isn't direct income, per say, it provides the revenue that we reinvest into the next property.\n\nI'm currently in negotiations for a small retail property in which I'll also own a portion of the business that will move in. It wont be a full time job, but it's a challenge and will produce another long term revenue source.\n\nMy point is, while I was exhausted and burnt out from my job, I also wasnt fulfilled of \"happy\" in a world where I felt like my skills and experience weren't being utilized.\n\nWhether its a new hobby, getting involved in politics, pursuing non-profit work, launching a new business, or any number of other ideas... I know that some people are not happy unless they feel challenged.\n\nMaybe this is something your wife could explore?",
            "My wife exchanged a good paying job with a bad schelude jwith one that pays less but allows her to be at home at nigth and weekends.\n\nSure we get less money at end of the month but shes more happy and can spend more time with me and our son..\nTotally worth it.\n\nWho gets more money doesnt matter. Its team work.\n\nEdited: you gonna spend most of your life working. Do something that you enjoy and you will be much happier.",
            "Keep telling her, verbalize appreciation for things she does (laundry, cooking, managing finances).  A LOT!  If this doesn\u2019t help, maybe a few sessions with a counselor to get her self esteem back on track.  She may still have the attorney mentality of \u201cmoney makes the man.\u201d",
            "hmm, i think she has to tell you what she feels can make up for the lack in monetary contribution to the household, because there's no way you're going to convince her if she keeps feeling this way. \n\nGiven the practicality of this situation, the only thing you can probably do is quantify her intangible contributions into monetary terms and see if she thinks that has value. But this does not solve the root of the issue - her perception that her choices had a 'negative' impact. Under this train of thought, something like volunteering also does not really solve the root issue because while it's a good use of her time, it's still not contributing to the household in a practical manner, so your communication with her has to really look at what she thinks is the best way to increase her contribution without going back to a high-pressure role.\n\nOn your end, are there any side projects for your home that you haven't gotten around to doing and can ask her to take full control of (e.g. redecorating, preparing for xmas, etc)? This is a good time to get creative as well.\n\nBest of luck to you OP!",

Thank you.",
            "The only input I could offer is that every relationship has its dynamic flows.\nInitially she was contributing more to your life financially, and now she is contributing more in other ways. It most likely always won't be that way, things will eventually change and maybe she will start working as an attorney again and be bringing in more money.\nMaybe if you frame it like that she will feel a bit better about the situation?\n\nFrom her high previous income it seems like it was possible for you to buy your house and do others things. That was a huge contribution to your lives.\nPerhaps she needs something else in life to help her feel more fulfilled, maybe it's not just the money and household contribution that is making her feel like this. She has more extra time on her hands, maybe there's something she is passionate about that you can encourage her to persue? Volunteering for a non-profit, providing pro bono legal advice for a cause she is passionate about, beginning or fine tuning a hobby or interest, joining a local club?\n\nEither way, you sound like a great partner! Like seriously, she seems very lucky to have you.\nThis is a major issue with relationships and you do seem like you are on the right track.\n\nBest of luck!",
            "Surprisingly this sounds like me. However I do know my way around it. (When I say me, I mean I have a similar mentality to the wife, I am not the wife). \n\nI swear I constantly feel like I'm not doing enough. I feel like I'm \"behind\" professionally, academically, and in my personal life. Especially when my academic & personal life started to take over 80% of my life leaving my personal life with almost nothing, I really felt the change. \n\nIf your wife is anything like me, she isn't used to the change. She attaches her worth to the numbers on the check, not the actions she does around the house. \n\nAs menial as it is, I would make a T-chart. On each side is both of your contributions to the household. If you think it would help, for all the household chores (mowing the lawn, washing the dishes, etc.) Find out how much it would cost to pay someone else to do it. Its a visual representation of what her actions are worth. She may find out the cut in hours resulted in earning more money than before because she's doing things herself which is saving the both of you lots in the long run. \n\nI hope this helps!",
            "First off, you are a fantastic husband!! Kudos. Second off, to reiterate what others are saying, try your best to reassure her that what she brings in is enough. In fact, she was bringing in more than enough for so long which has helped get you guys to where you are financially. I would also try to reiterate that she is much happier, much more stress-free in this job, which should matter more than the income (not in every case, but I\u2019d say in this case). Seeing her happy and home more instead of working crazy hours and stressed is contribution enough. It\u2019s also probably better for the relationship. Plus, if she ever wants to venture out to the job she previously had, encourage that too. Good luck!",
            "This is such a hard situation. My husband makes twice as much as I do and I still worry about leaving a job I have absolutely detested for five years because I won\u2019t be able to find anything that pays more. I\u2019ve wanted to be financially independent my whole life, and can\u2019t let myself lean on him even though I know he wouldn\u2019t feel negatively about it. Feels like trading one mental burden for another.",
            "I just wanna say, after reading your story and many comments, that you sound like a genuine caring person and you appreciate her so much. The fact that you have actually listened to her feelings makes you a great person. She is very lucky and I'm sure you are too. You are looking for advice to make her happy and honestly it sounds like you guys have great basic relationship respect. That's hard to find and without even knowing you, I respect you just based on that information.  I wish you both luck in getting over this hurdle and just give her hug and tell her you love her. Stay positive:)",
            "Man, I feel like I'm headed for her path in a few years, as do most of my attorney friends. I suspect part of this is she feels a little bored. Most of us attorneys need high challenge--that's partly why we sought out this godforsaken career. I wonder if maybe expanding her 15 hours a week to more wouldn't make her happier and then she wouldn't fixate on contribution. \n\nOn another note, uh, really interested to hear how she made this career transition...",
            "I\u2019d tally up the hours she\u2019s spends on domestic labor (cleaning, cooking, keeping yalls social calendar, running household errands, etc) calculate how much you\u2019d have to pay someone else to complete that work to the same standard, and then show her how much money she is saving y\u2019all. \n\nI think it\u2019s very common for people to assume that domestic labor has no monetary value, because usually it\u2019s done for free, but that is NOT true.   \n\nI think continuously expressing your appreciation for the unpaid work she does will help, as will reminding her much much happier YOU are with this arrangement.\n\nI\u2019m a recovering attorney too.  No amount of money is worth being miserable.  Bless you for enabling her to make this career change!",
            "I relate to your wife's feelings on this, so I'll write out my feelings from that side. \n\nI work part time and my spouse works full time. My hourly wage is also much lower because of our different fields. But I'm able to do important work at my job helping people, and I like my coworkers. My flexible schedule lets me take care of all of the groceries and other shopping, be around for deliveries, take the dog to vet appointments, etc. My spouse, like you, always reminds me that they fully support me doing this job (or whatever job I want), acknowledges my contribution to the household, stresses that financial contributions aren't the only important thing. That we're both keeping things running. I also have some chronic pain issues that can be rough on me, and they worry that would get worse if I worked full time (I used to work a schedule that was close to full time, and it was more difficult physically). \n\nDespite having all of this support, and despite knowing that I do a lot--and that my schedule also leaves me the time and energy to try to build an art career on the side--it feels bad that I don't bring in \"real\" money. I'm always thinking about how much more money we could have if I just did X or Y, or how much less I'm making. I think about how undervalued and underpaid my field is in general, and that also sucks. Part of it is the way our society links financial contributions to value as a person. Part of it is that I still have guilt at earning less, especially because we both grew up in financially unstable families and I want to have more savings to feel more secure. \n\nIt does help for my partner to reassure me, but I try not to put that responsibility on them every time. We do talk it out when I'm feeling crappy about things, and it does help when they remind me this is the plan we decided on together. (And I do the same for them when they talk about whether they should chase a much higher paycheck vs. the job they love, and I always tell them it's not worth it to give up the meaningful work. So we both have to talk each other down.)\n\nBeing at home too much is also hard, so I make an effort to go out regularly. Whether that's taking my laptop to a coffee shop to work on artsy stuff or going to the park, it does help. I do keep an eye on job listings in case I find something else that will work out better, but it sounds like your wife's current job is ideal for the upcoming plans to have a baby--so like others have said, maybe volunteering for a cause important to her could help her add some purpose to more of her hours. \n\nIt may just be that \"every once in awhile\" she's going to have those feelings, and have to deal with them. My sadness/stress about it comes in cycles, too. I'll be fine for a while, then for some reason I'll be sad about it or worried I'm not doing enough. Be there to listen, remind her you both decided this for a reason and you are 100% behind her, and since you said she already sees a therapist, encourage her to bring it up with her therapist. \n\nI've seen some suggestions to calculate the monetary value of things she does and how much it would cost to hire people to do that, and I'm sure that works for some people, but it wouldn't work for me--it feels too transactional. It does help to remember the amount of time I spend taking care of things like managing the finances or meal planning or taking the car to the shop or whatever. I can shop during the day when it's slow so neither of us has to go deal with Costco on a Saturday, for example.",
            "I don\u2019t have any advice but thanks for being a loving husband who cares about her more than money. \n\nI have never made much but my husband technically makes enough so I COULD stay home if I wanted. I work and pay for smaller bills as well as all my own needs/wants and social outings and whatnot. So he is able to save a decent amount of money cuz he doesn\u2019t have to pay for my personal stuff. \n\nI never hear the end of it. I don\u2019t make as much as him. His savings is not mine, I am entitled to none of it. We separated and were going to divorce and he was adamant about not giving me anything I didn\u2019t \u201cearn\u201d except for child support. He makes back handed comments about if I made more money I could make more decisions or get a new car (mine is old and getting to be almost more to repair then it\u2019s worth) or maybe I should find a way to make more money so he could take time off and not work, etc. \n\nHe\u2019s pretty caring in most other ways but the money and income difference is so hurtful and frustrating. You are a great husband for valuing her health and sanity and what she gives you more than the amount of money she brings in. \n\nMaybe show her this post. Let her see your true feelings written out.",
            "I just want to say you are a true gem as far as partners go! At first glance I was so worried that you\u2019d be complaining about being the primary breadwinner. But to see you actually acknowledge that housework is work too? That\u2019s so refreshing! \n\nI\u2019d compliment her on the job she does around the house. Often. That\u2019ll make her feel appreciated. Other than that I don\u2019t have much advice, as this is an emotional hurdle she must get past, and only she has control over that unfortunately.",
            "I don't know if you'll see this, but show your wife my response if you do. Before I met my partner I was on my way to teaching Pilates in addition to my massage practice. I would probably be making $70k+ per year and working towards more plus social media and YouTube income. Instead I'm raising our daughter and working one hour per week. I clean our house, take care of the dog, do our shopping, and feel like I'm never doing enough. \n\nReading from men like you actually reminds me of how much my partner values my work. He tells me plenty of course, but sometimes I just don't feel like I'm good enough. I should be doing more! Then I read what other men write about their partners and it hits me, this is what my partner thinks! I realise I do so much, just in a different way than before, and I still contribute to our family. I hope your wife reads this and realises how awesome she is and how much she makes your life more beautiful! She makes your home lovely so the two of you can enjoy your time together and that is priceless, she isn't stressed out, so she's happy to see you and can feel free from work while with you. \n\nI think it goes both ways. If your job had been rubbish and you could have changed it to make your life better, you would have, right? She needs to know that. She had the chance to be amazing while not working herself to the bone and she took it, that's awesome and she should be proud. Show her this and let her know how amazing she is.",
            "My situation was different but similar  - I was in school then could only find part time work for a couple of years and felt awful about not contributing financially in my relationship with my well-paid partner - and it kind of wreaked havoc on my self-esteem. He never wavered in telling me how much he appreciated what I brought to the relationship in other ways and that he saw us as a team, and that included supporting each other financially, but I felt like I was letting us down and letting myself down because depending on a man financially was not where I imagined myself at that point in my career. I finally broke down when a therapist asked me what would happen if I went easier on myself and I realized the answer was that I would be a better partner.  I would be more fun to be around because I wouldn\u2019t bring negativity and stress to the table. It might take a come-to-Jesus moment for her to realize it, but hopefully your unwavering support will continue to bolster her until she feels secure enough to believe it.",
            "I can relate to this. In the beginning my husband made almost double what I made, and I made decent money, he just made really good money. Fast-forward to 6 months into my pregnancy and he lost his job, and now I\u2019m the main provider. He doesn\u2019t care at all, calls me his Sugar Mama lol. I love it. She\u2019ll learn to let go of her pride and be happy she has a husband who appreciates her no matter what!",
            "I went from working 50 hours a week to not working at all, then 5 months after becoming a housewife I became pregnant. I\u2019m currently a SAHM. For reference, I\u2019m the youngest of 4, but the recession hit right when I was 15. I\u2019ve held at least two jobs for as long as I can remember, trying to ease the financial burden off my parents as much as possible. \n\nThe transition, for me, was horribly isolating. There\u2019s really only so much day-to-day monotonous stuff you can get done without it feeling lonely. You\u2019re left with just yourself and your thoughts. It gives you time to be introspective, but it also brings up your deepest fears and insecurities. It\u2019s probably a weird place in life for her, working 15 hours a week, but does she have any friends that she can grab coffee with mid day? Most, if not all, of her friends probably have full time jobs. Therapy might help. Have you asked her what will help her feel fulfilled? Perhaps she can be a contractor, picking up an extra job here or there when she feels like it. I feel for you and your wife, it\u2019s so hard. Your communication is great, you guys sound like great people! I saw you had mentioned she goes to therapy. Have you considered going with her?

            "Sorry to pry, but my husband is in law school right now and we're both a little worried about how he'll be able to handle work/life balance when he graduates.  How did your wife find her current, lower stress job?",
            "Why did it have to go from 60 hours to 15 hours? There was no middle ground?",
            "Going from 60hrs to 15hrs, after being a student, and after years of independence sounds like a void/insecurty maybe? (Protecting) Your description of her screams success. I wonder if your wife is feeling the lack of activity or lack of independence or lack of personal money or something else as the cause of this contribution business. She sounds perfect for local nonprofit work. Could really make a difference for a cause, having independence in a dif social circle, doing something meaningful and yet zero income from it! I wouldn't push too much tho. If im projecting, id feel insecure if I wasnt feeling equal about the resources I offer in my relationship. Sounds like shes processing and trying to think of ways to continue bringing something to your family.",
            "I went through something kind of similar. I got pregnant with our son and a shitstorm him my well paying job to make a long story, I was voluntarily laid off.. which worked out perfectly because I told my husband if I got pregnant, I wouldnt want to work during the pregnancy and I wouldnt want to work after the baby was born. I figured I'd be a stay at home until he was 1. \n\nHe turned 1 and I still wasnt ready to go back to work but 50 percent of me was. I struggled for a long time with not being able to work. I've always strived to be independent and being a stay at home mom, asking my husband for money and him paying all of the Bill's was a foreign feeling and I did not enjoy it. That inner turmoil continued until my son turned 4. I got an offer to come back to my previous job and I even got a 6 dollar raise, JUST TO COME BACK. I gladly jumped on it and I'm going on year two with the company again. \n\nThe only advice I'd have to say is just pay attention to her. I sank into a really dark depression about a year after I left my work and I had a new baby. I wasnt taking care of myself and was just not happy with my life. Just keep tabs on her and check in with her often. Hopefully shell let you know if something is up. Unfortunately that itch for her will never go away. Itll always be in the back of her mind because that's just how she is hardwired. It's easy to look back and be like, wow... we could have X amount of dollars but its doesnt help anything. Maybe her saying those things to you is just a way for her to have you ease her mind verbally. Maybe tell her that money is never important and her mental health and happiness is more than enough. Ask her if theres anything you could do to help her get to that same mindset? Other than that, I dont have much advice. \n\n^^^sorry ^^^this ^^^turned ^^^into ^^^a ^^^novel",
            "Show her this!! You sound like a really thoughtful husband. I think her lack of stress is causing your marriage to be even happier and more blissful. That matters a lot! As they say, money doesn\u2019t buy happiness, and you can\u2019t buy me love",
            "I am basically your wife in terms of situation. I left the well paid stress job, took a happier lower hour lower pay job. I was also very independent and now know that I am financially dependent on having a partner.\n\nIt's hard, but just being there is the key. Just be there every day, same as always.  It'll take time, but she just needs time to process.\n\nThe key bits that get me down:\n\nLess disposable money for myself (not as a couple). You can't fix that, just let it be.\n\nHer guilt about how you feel. Just be low level reassuring. Don't go in the opposite direction with assuring her, just be cool with it, and she'll adjust.\n\nToo much free time to think. This is my killer, free time brings me down. Maybe buy her 10 guitar lessons, or pottery lessons, whatever you think she might like to try, and encourage her to find an additional hobby. Could help swallow some time, and find people to fill the colleague hole.\n\nYou seem like a good guy. It took me about a year to recalibrate, everyone is different, just be there and don't overthink it. Pretty normal reaction on her part. Good luck!",
            "I'm super late to the game, but I think it would be thoughtful to do things now that she has more free time.  You seem like a considerate husband. I imagine, there are fun events that she has missed    out on, because of her time consuming job. Memories are hard to establish if one party is absent. Do something fun. Go do things as a couple. Memories are important. Say/let her know that you value time together. She sounds like a quality individual. Hope everything works out.",

            "I\u2019m in a similar boat - I\u2019m currently the attorney working 50-60 hours weeks, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to sustain it for much longer (a couple more years).  The long hours and high stress definitely make me miserable. \n\nBut one of the reasons I\u2019m in this job in the first place is because I\u2019m someone who enjoys a challenge, likes to be mentally stimulated etc. When work has the odd quiet patch (hardly ever) or when I went on secondment to work in house at a bank, I was also unhappy because there wasn\u2019t enough to do/not enough stimulation. \n\nI\u2019ve realised what will be important to me going forward is finding a balance - less intense than my current job, but not by too much. For me, it wouldn\u2019t so much be about the money - maybe she doesn\u2019t quite have the balance right at 15 hours? From a brief skim of the comments it sounds like she is busy with other things, but it\u2019s not quite the same!",
            "It seems to me that you are already doing a great job at telling her how much she contributes and how you appreciate it. I think she needs to come around and find her peace with it from within herself.\n\nI wonder if her problem might be partly routed in this culture of protestant work ethic which basically says you are only worthy if you work hard.\n\nApart from that, the aspect that resonated most with me is her issue with being dependent on you. I think in order to address this, I can think of different things:\n\n1. How hard would it be for her to get back into a job that makes her financially independent? I think it's always good to be prepared for bad times. If it would be hard what can she do now to increase the range of options she can have?\n\n2. Is your current lifestyle dependent on your current income levels and what are your options in case your income drops suddenly?\n\n3. Have you explored options where she could increase her work hours such that she feels more comfortable about her contribution?",

            "Thank you so much for sharing this. Reading through your post makes me realize how despite the constant reassure and positive reinforcement from my husband that I'm doing great, I still often feel inadequate and pressure myself to make more, even though we don't need it financially. \n\nI also want to thank you for being so supportive and patient with your wife. Personally I also feel guilty about feeling guilty (haha so meta) despite my husband's constant reassurance and love. I'm worried he'll be tired of being supportive one day, so I wonder if your wife may feel like that too. Although I absolutely trust my husband, I sometimes wonder if I don't find his reassurance convincing because I know he loves me, so of course he'd say I'm great. Your wife may have similar thoughts, so I'm not sure if there's anything else that you can do personally. \n\nBut back to my first point, I actually found reading your post and the encouraging comments below helpful because hey, turns out someone else also has this problem, and alot of other people agree that she's great (and since I'm in a similar situation, that hopefully extends to me?).

My 22-year-old boyfriend, on the other hand, lives back at home twelve hours away, never went to college so has no debt, but is incredible at what he does and makes ~$80k a year. Additionally, I live in a ridiculously high cost-of-living city, and we are from very rural Iowa, so he has fewer expenses. For reference, I pay $350 a month to share a bedroom in a gross, old, uninsulated house here, and he pays $220 a month on a much nicer, cleaner, more modern one-bedroom at home. \n\nHe takes care of all the expenses (flights, food, outings, hotel so we don\u2019t have to hang around my roommates) when he comes to visit. He sends me money for rent, groceries, and my calc tutor, and continually offers to pay part of my tuition. He pays our rent at home. He buys groceries at home. He fills up my car, changes my oil, and never lets me pay when we go out.\n\nThis sounds like a perfect situation for a lot of girls, but honestly it breaks my heart that I can\u2019t contribute financially. He does a really good job of reminding me that I contribute in other ways, that I\u2019m in school and it would be selfish of him not to share his income with me, and that someday this is all gonna balance out.

            "I am actually in the same boat as your wife. I gave up a job with a very wealthy venture capitalist firm, doing I.T. for really good money. The problem? I have years of experience in doing system and infrastructure implimentation. What they had me doing was setting up computers manually, and doing all the new employee on-boarding.\n \nIt sounds easy enough and a stupid simple way to collect six figures a year, but they needed me doing things that I'd already done for well-established organizations and they wouldn't let me do that. After 8 months of of fighting fires I left because the company was being investigate by a certain three letter organization. As a contractor, I wasn't about to have my name attached to any of that bad shit, especially with no control over it, and after 8 months of being completely underutilized and over-worked i quit. Not outright, mind you. I warned management that if they didn't get their shit together I was done and I was out.\n\nAll that was easy... My wife has been very supportive and understanding, but it's been tough for me. While my wife is always going to make significantly more than me, I was at least helping. Now I am doing odd jobs and filling in to make some extra cash. We aren't hurting for it, it's just more like me not feeling useful in the classic sense u always have been. Trying to redefine my value and worth that is not attached to a making what was frankly a stupid amount of money, has been the real trouble.\n\nAs long as you're supportive and you're not hurting financial, the transition will come in time for her. She needs to realize that you value her for far more than extra income. While you can tell her this, she really just needs to be comfortable in a different role and provide differently. This kind of problem is tough because it exists in her head, despite what you do or don't say. Just re-affirming the fact that you didn't marry her for income is helpful, but ultimately she has to be comfortable with this for herself. It takes a while. I'm still not there myself, but it's my hangup and my wife is very supportive, but it is a problem that we have to save for ourselves.",

            "I could be useful to look at everything together in aggregate, as in, as a couple, you are able to have the money you need and have free time and less stress the way things are now (as opposed to \"I\"m doing x and you're doing y\"), things around the house get done, errands are taken care of and all of that benefits you as a couple making your life nice. Plus these things ebb and flow. Ten years from now, things could be very different, and perhaps the lack of stress and time can lead to enjoyable, productive things for her in the future that can't even be imagined yet. With the extra time she might find something else she enjoys too. So many couples don't work together, but rather keep their individual hopes and dreams and ideas of self worth separate, rather than communicating and figuring out what they want together out of life - which can lead to a lot of frustration and sometimes resentment. But if you focus on that rather than the individual desires they can be reframed so it's positive rather than something she feels bad about? I don't know. I'm not trained in this, it's just my feeling and view from making past missteps. You sound like you communicate so you're well ahead of the average, I think.",

She may have been able to do what she did because on some level she was afraid of exactly the position she finds herself in now, and is having a hard time dealing with it. It could be that lowering her stress and having more time to enjoy her interests isn't enough for her to re-learn her value as a partner outside of her ability to make money. It sounds like you're doing a good job of supporting her and re-affirming your love for her and all that she brings to your marriage. Hopefully over time she'll see that and get over old hang ups.

I would continue to be supportive and tell her she is contributing her fair share. I might suggest a couples counseling or an individual therapist appointment for her.

            "Sometime people come on here saying their spouse doesn\u2019t contribute enough to household chores and people tell them to write down all that they do and how much time or energy or planning it takes them to do it. When a dollar value or amount of time is put on those tasks, the \u201cslacking\u201d partner often realizes that they haven\u2019t understood how much their \u201coverworked\u201d partner was actually doing. It\u2019s easy to be blind to things that happen without you realizing. \n\nIt\u2019s also easy to be blind to how much you actually do if you feel like it\u2019s not enough. I think you should do this exercise backwards with your wife. Write out all you do and then ask her to do the same. Maybe getting all of those household/budget/planning/mental load tasks out on paper will reassure her that she is contributing more than enough. \n\nMy other thought is that it might just take time. She\u2019s having a major identity shift and it\u2019s difficult, no matter which direction your life is changing. Keep encouraging her, thanking her for the work she\u2019s doing around your home and also telling her how happy you are to spend more time together. She\u2019ll get there. :)",

Watch out for depression. Get her on some non-profit boards so she has something else to fill her time and also something else to talk about with friends and with you. This isn't about money, it's about her not living up to the standards she set for herself a long time ago to be a strong, self-sufficient and successful woman. She needs to reset her standards.",
            "I took a huge pay cut for a job that I am happy in and fits our family life better. When we were discussing it, I was concerned about bringing home less than before and my income not being similar to my husband\u2019s. He told me that my happiness was worth more than any money, and that you can\u2019t take money with you when you die. \n\nIt made me see that the ways I now contribute by being the one working close to our home and our kids school, keeping the household ship shape by working from home one day a week, and by having quality time together using my extra vacation and sick days.  I also contribute by keeping my stress levels manageable so I can support my husband in his stressful job. All worth way more than my old income. \n\nI would suggest taking an inventory of the non-monetary ways your wife can now contribute, now that she is out of her demanding job. Emphasise the value of these things to you to make her really feel good about the shift.",

While everyone has made great suggestions, here's a slightly different one:\n\nTake her out for a romantic dinner/vacation/holiday/something that she loves and make it all about her. Make sure she's really appreciated. Make it a weekend, maybe.\n\nIt may not solve the problem but it'll show that you care, you're listening and you appreciate her.

She runs the house as you\u2019ve said so really hammer home how not having to stress over those things has helped you with completing your own work more effectively.  Bring up how seeing her more has improved your mood and overall life positively.  Try to tie what she does for you with what you earn yourself, and it\u2019ll be much easier for her with both that and her part time job to see herself as a co equal part of your family, contributing just as much as you, as her actions help you with what you bring to the relationship",

I work 40-50 hours a week and do ALL indoor cleaning AND shopping. I sometimes cook (our kitchen sucks, so we eat out A LOT MORE THAN WE SHOULD). I groom our dog and go to his vet appointments by myself. I thrive under pressure. Roar! #girlpower",
            "Unfortunately, it may just come down to reminding her fairly consistently until the point is driven home. I can completely understand where she is coming from too. I actually lost my job of 9 years while I was out on maternity leave. We struggled quite a bit because I was the higher earner and suddenly we didn't have that money anymore. I felt like a total loser having to go and get unemployment welfare. I felt like a failure as a mother and a partner. I would express this to him and he would keep telling me not to worry, that I would find something better, that he didn't think I was a loser or a waste of space, that I was still contributing by doing the majority of the household stuff + caring for our baby. It was VERY hard to believe that and I kinda continued just feeling guilty and like I contributed nothing. I did find another job which was closer to home and pays more (so better) but it is pretty high stress and demanding too. You know what happened? Now I just feel guilty for NOT being home with my kid, for having to work weekends sometimes, for being tired/stressed a lot of the time. \n\nSo... she may believe you eventually. Or she may be like me and will always find a reason to kick herself for one thing or another.",
            "I don't think this is your problem to help. I get the sense that she's a highly motivated person who just got burned out.  I don't think it's about her contributing if you're not lacking, i think she just misses work.  I have no evidence to back this up except all the successful people in my circle are like that.",

            "It seems to me like maybe she should job hunt some more.  There's probably a middle ground where she'd feel more comfortable.  Like 30-40 hrs/week making roughly the same as you.  That depends of course on how much you two value her getting the running the house stuff done while you are at work, so you have your home time to enjoy together.\n\nAnother idea along those lines is to look into the costs to hire someone to do those things.  A maid, the cost of eating out/getting takeout every night.  That might help her see the value of that extra work.  Not everything has to be about money, but if she can't stop running the numbers in her head at least make sure she's running accurate ones.",
            "Since your wife seems very attached to her monetary value for the household, you could estimate how much it would cost if you hired someone for all the tasks she now does aside from work, that could make her realise she underestimates greatly her contribution.\n\nI prefer all the things you told us about her rather than attaching monetary value to everything though.",
            "Maybe she should split the baby and find a less stressful job that pays a little more. Speaking from personal experience, I was in a similar situation and there's nothing my SO could have said or done to make me feel better. I don't want to be taken care of financially. I wanted to contribute as a true financial partner. Some people don't mind it and even prefer it, but I think some people just weren't meant to be house spouses.",

            "You live in the USA? Cuz the medica problems a high stress job will give you later on as it slowly wears down your health will probably save you money in the long run.  USA healthcare will bankrupt you.\n\nThis may not help her feel better now, but honestly I dont think the high stress job for a bit more money is worth it, quality of life or money wise.",
            "Money saved on mental health and the physical ramifications from poor mental health= money earned\n\nLook up maid services, the cost of eating out/hiring a chef, cost of a personal shopper, personal assistant, anything you can think of that she does and add the cost of the work she does together and show it to her. (If you want to pad it a bit look at the higher end services for a couple of them and use those numbers) This is part of her income. \n\nSmaller tasks that acquire some income but take a little work might be helpful for her to feel like she\u2019s doing more: mystery shopping, using the ibotta ap when grocery shopping, user testing for websites are all things that helped my mom when she was in a similar situation (and still helps). She also got really into a particular hobby which takes up about an hour each day and boosted her mood dramatically. Maybe try taking her on activity based dates until she finds something she really likes (painting, pottery, primitive wood working, acrylic pour, hiking, trail riding, anything!)\n\nTranscribing is a work from home job that takes a while to build but may be a good fit if she\u2019s adequate at grammar and spelling. Look into legal transcription jobs she could apply for. It won\u2019t be much work at first but it can build steadily and she may fee more fulfilled.\n\nSupplementing her activities seems like a great way to help her feel she is contributing more without adding pressure :)",
            "She could add gig jobs if she really wants to contribute more, or she could do some volunteer work for a charity you both believe in. She could also talk to a therapist, because if you keep telling her she is contributing more than salary and you are happy, there may be something underlying that she needs to address.",
            "Maybe you should put the emphasis on being a team. She is happier, you are happier, she has more time for both of you, you can plan for a kid; all this contributes more to your relationship than that extra money would. I think those feelings of hers are more of a side effect of waiting to get pregnant.",
            "You guys have kids? If not, Best time is to plan now since she has spare time..  \nHad similar issue with my wife.. she was stressed out and wanted to quit and I said sure.. 3 months she enjoyed it and then got depressed that she is at home while her friends all work.. so now she is back to working and initially happy and again wants to quit.. this time I persuaded her to take a less stressful job but not quit.. in your case I think she needs to find a job which does not exceed 40 hours a week\nIt\u2019s worse if she starts feeling down .. good luck to you guys",

            "Is she an older sibling in her family? Did her family start out poor? Those could be factors in how she feels, too.",
            "I think the best way to communicate this to her is let her know Hey you brought home the big bucks for the first 5 years, now its my turn... when my turn is over we can revisit how your feeling. Hopefully something along those lines might work for you because my BF and I went through a different but similar situation when he lost his job and couldnt find a new one right away. He made a little more than double what I brought home at the time. I got a second job and took care of things so he could focus on finding not just a new job but the right one. It was hard for him and he was upset about it alot  but it was the right call because he loves where he works now and has been there a few years and feels secure again. I hope this helps! \nP.S. I think it's so great that your more focused on her happiness than a paycheck, not everyone is lucky enough to have a partner like you!",
            "Bills are important, but like you said y\u2019all are doing fine. Being in a partnership where one person is living just to fulfill expectations is a recipe for unhappiness. When y\u2019all are both fulfilled, the life you build together will always have positive potential. Also, she sounds like a pragmatic person, and I would word my response in pragmatic terms. Cheers to you both. You sound like a great guy, and she sounds like a wonderful woman.",
            "Just actively notice the things she does. Tell her how much you appreciate coming home to a clean house, how much easier it is for you to relax since she's already five the things that need done.  You can tell her as well that you appreciate that she stuck it to get rid of the major debt and that you hope she's enjoying the fruits of her hard work (having time to herself).\n\nShe'll get used to having more time. If she doesn't feel like she does enough she should find an interesting hobby or volunteer work. \n\nIt sounds like you guys are a great couple!",
            "Why isn't she working more than 15 hours. I really suggest that you don't let her rest on that, you'll probably wind up regretting it. Having no obligations is addictive for many.",

You don't need the money, and she is feeling guilty about having too much free time. 99% of people would gladly trade places with her.\n\nThat said, I do think she needs to think about her purpose in life. With that much free time and essentially living off of your income, I can see why she feels unimportant or guilty. Having a child will quickly change that, though.

He's still continuing therapy and his medication is slightly helping (although it'll take a few more weeks to really kick in) but he registered for his prereq classes without me saying anything or reminding him and he has been trying to help with cleaning when he can. So there has been some overall improvement.\n\nWe also talked about Pokemon Go, how he's using it as a coping mechanism and how that's okay (I cannot stress enough how I want him to still feel okay playing), but also how we can't just drop everything all the time for it. We just got back from a small holiday trip and the entire time, he kept the Pokemon Go under control and played when we wanted but not when we were doing dinner, taking parents places, and such. He showed a lot of restraint and a lot of respect for the stuff we talked about. \n\nI have also done a few raids with him and his people from discord, and I'm really glad he has this group of random Pokemon people that he knows by their Pokemon nicknames and stuff. It's actually very sweet, and not forced socialization or awkward adult-friend-making...they just go do raids, trade pokemon and know each other from these small moments. It's good for him, especially as his social circle has shrunk over the past few years. It's all so low key and low pressure that I really do think it's healthy for him to do these raids and talk to people about his hobby.\n\nI'm also trying to be receptive that his way of \"giving\" to me right now is by helping me with the game. He really likes to play PoGo with me and gets excited when I get a shiny or catch a legendary in a raid. I have to realize that while the depression stops him from acting like he cares about stuff like cleaning or eating, this is a small glimpse into what he can be like once he gets better again (and also, a glimpse of his old self). \n\nI wanted to thank everyone who shared their stories of depression and opened my eyes to the fact that there is so much more to being depressed than just being unmotivated/sad/empty. I had no idea that his motivation in the game was part of the depression and part of coping with life. Thanks for all the stories, seriously, they meant so much.",

There have been glimmers of improvement, but ultimately he's \"alive\" but absolutely without life. He has no friends, no goals, no real interest in anything but games.\n\nI'm very sorry you're going through this. I have so so much empathy for you.

            "I've lived similarly to the way you're describing your SO - I've struggled with depression my entire life, and have played games compulsively to avoid facing it, and to be honest when I'm using a game as distraction, I need to cut myself off entirely. I've learned that if I feel even the slightest twinge of an urge to avoid adult life, the only way I can pull myself out of it and be fully functional is to stop playing games for awhile. Your results may vary, everyone is different of course. But for me, gaming can become addictive easily, and I've had to learn to be okay with not gaming at all for awhile sometimes. I think your attitude is wonderfully kind and it's admirable that you're so respectful of his needs and desires and are trying to share them. But if he is anything like me, the slippery slope will always be there, and I'd be cautious about relapses into depression and avoidance. Video games are designed to be addictive, what you and he are facing together is very similar to an addiction, and sometimes you really need to treat it as such. Good luck OP!",
            "You sound super supportive and caring but I seriously hope you're taking care of yourself as well. Not playing Pokemon Go during dinner / family obligations is a super super low bar. Same with cleaning when he can. Same with his way of giving you is teaching you the game. I hope that youre just holding back info and there's more to this relationship. \n\nIm not judging him really, I deal with depression. I know it sucks. I honestly feel bad if I'm dating someone and hit one of these spells. But this update is really the tiniest of baby steps. I can't imagine how difficult this is for you. I do hope things get better but please remember that you're important too. ",
            "Reading this I cant help but thinking that Pokemon Go isnt being the best help for all of this.  It's a highly addictive game and putting all energy into 1 thing that is essentially un-completeable can also fuel depression in a different light. I love Pokemon go, but some of the people I meet with 3 phones and 30 of each legendary.. that's not healthy. It's nice he has a hobby but it should be a stepping stone to move onwards and upwards. Any single focus on 1 thing whether it's a job or a hobby can get too much. Once he's settled a bit I think OP should introduce her bf to a new hobby that is active, inexpensive and unbingeable. Jogging for example.\n\nI'm glad things are moving forward, and i only hope they get better",
            "If it makes you feel better about sticking with him.. I was dating a girl for about 4-5 years.  Great girl, but I was miserable with myself because I was stuck in a terrible dead end job and definitely not feeling like I was living up to my potential.  I went on a little depression binge playing an online game (original EverQuest) and pretty much abandoned my great relationship.  The game was my coping mechanism for my depression.  \n\nTwenty years later and I'm an extremely happy guy with a great career and two kids. I still feel terrible for how I treated my ex back in the day.  Probably my greatest life regret.  But it all worked out in the end. ",

Your support is always appreciated. ",

He turned to this to help him escape reality and that's something that must be faced.\nHe,you and the 2 of you should do both private and couples therapy to help discover and remove or learn healthy ways to deal with his depression.\nDoing his game more than an hour or two a day is excessive.\nI hope he gets better, but being an enabler isn't getting him to where he should be. And yes he is doing better but there is still a long way to go.",
            "You sound like his (amazing) caretaker, not his girlfriend. Obviously, if you're a caring person and your partner is in need, you'll have to play that role sometimes, but imo it's not healthy for you (or the relationship) taking it to these extremes. \n\nI have chronical depression so I'm not unsympathetic to your partner, but I'm also sympathetic to you, and personally I wouldn't like to be in a *romantic* relationship that leans so heavily on the caretaking aspect above all else. \n\nI'd just advise you to not forget about yourself, and to be honest with yourself about your own needs; if one day you find you can't be the caretaker all the time, that's fine and super valid, and you can decide from there which steps you should take.\n\nGood luck and take care of yourself.

I go into a game and I\u2019m a Pok\u00e9mon trainer, or an Ace Attorney, or some guy in gta, or a pilot in Elite Dangerous. I can absorb myself into that world and everything else is gone.

As for the time being, it seems to be going well and if he keeps this momentum, I think he can do well. Also, it does take at least 1-2 months for psych meds to work.

            "I think both of y'all are awesome. It sounds like you guys are trying monumentally hard and I'm pulling for you!! So I just want to highlight this from your earlier post:\n\n>Before we dated, I always thought he was a cool guy who was good at everything. And it's true, he IS handsome and has great style and he IS smart and good at many things. But the person we all thought he was is actually a front for an insecure, scared human being. He projects being \"good\" at things because he was raised that way\u2014son of immigrant parents who are VERY hard on him personally and culturally\u2014and he feels like he needs to be the best, all the time.  \n>  \n>I noticed early on that he gets overwhelmed easily. He pretends to know things then researches the crap out of them to get by doing whatever he's doing. He survives purely on intuition and fake confidence, but he crumbles in secret. He gets sick ALL the time from lack of sleep and stress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like when you first started dating, you thought he would be more \"confident and capable.\" (I put that in quotes because I know you don't *really* feel that he is incapable.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHOWEVER, a couple things you said stood out to me:\n\n**That he is not the \"person we all thought he was.\"**\n\n**That he \"survives purely on intuition and fake confidence.\"**\n\nNot to be harsh on you, but these comments show a slightly low regard for him. (Which, I know he left a gang of dead mice in the kitchen and all, but you know what I mean)\n\nI get the feeling that he is aware of / has picked up on the fact that people feel he's not good enough. Or that his confidence is \"fake.\"\n\nIt's like, he already has impostor syndrome, which is hard enough.\n\nSo to have other people confirm those fears...whether by outright saying he's dumb, or implying it, or just a disapproving look that says it all...I've experienced that, and it's awful to have others reaffirming your impostor syndrome even if they don't mean to!!\n\nI wanted to offer that perspective, because a lot of comments are calling him out and that's fair too. **But I think he just is EXTREMELY insecure and has EXTREMELY low self-esteem...**\n\n**...And thoughts like, \"he's not the person we all thought he was\" and \"he pretends to know things,\" no doubt show themselves in some way...and make his insecurity worse.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo basically, I think that if he has always felt like an impostor barely keeping it together...then it's important that if YOU ever have that perception, or there are times when you do...it doesn't creep into your conversations with him.\n\nAnd again, I say that not to put you at fault at all, but just because he's getting shit on enough and I want to offer a different perspective -- that his extreme insecurity and impostor syndrome has paralyzed him, so your job is to help him find other things he's good at and ways he can feel good about himself. Through tasks, through conversations, through new experiences together.\n\n**It's not your \"job\" to get rid of his impostor syndrome. BUT if that's at the core of his problems it's good for you to be aware of, so you (and a therapist as well) can help combat it.**",

I hope he continues to make steady progress (there will be setbacks now and then) so that he may bloom and you two can live happily. I imagine he has a lifetime of shit to unlearn but he\u2019s on the right track. That\u2019s HUGE, and he has you to thank because you led him there.

He might not always say it but I\u2019m willing to bet he would have no idea where he would be if you two had never met. \n\nSource: I never would have come to terms with my own depression and anxiety if I had not met my boyfriend. Didn\u2019t even know how bad it truly was until shit really started to escalate. I lived my entire life feeling this way, constantly being told that I was fine and nothing was wrong with me. Panic attacks were me being \u201cdramatic\u201d and bouts of horrible sadness were all \u201cin my head.\u201d My bf was the only one to truly listen to me and he was the one who encouraged me to seek help, even though he knew nothing about mental/emotional disorders and had no experience with either. It\u2019s been difficult at times for both of us, but he\u2019s been my constant through it all. I don\u2019t even want to know what my life would look like without him ever being a part of it. I feel so fucking grateful for him and his love for me\u2014now I get to be his constant and his support system in return because I am healthy enough to be who I want to be. So thank you, OP.

I told him this on Friday and said to take the weekend and think things over and that we could talk about it when I got home - either together on Sunday (when I got back from visiting family) or in couples counseling on Monday. \n\nHe opted to talk about it on Monday in therapy and made it seem like everything was fine in the meantime and then in therapy dropped the bomb on me that he thinks we should live in separate apartments but not break up. \n\nSo essentially - I live close to my work and he lives close to his. Note that he doesn\u2019t have a car and the closest train station is a 30-40 minute drive away from where I\u2019d be. He doesn\u2019t compromise in any way and I\u2019m supposed to believe this isn\u2019t a prelude to a breakup. \n\nI already feel like such a fool for having done this for almost 2 years because I thought we were building towards something together. \n\nThank you to everyone that commented on my previous post urging me to tackle this sooner rather than later. This monumentally sucks and I\u2019ve been crying for hours (did I mention that my cat is going in for tests today to see if she has cancer? And this is the timing he chose to pull the rug out from under our relationship?) but at least now I know I guess. \n\nTLDR: I have a 2-3 hour daily commute which I\u2019ve been doing for close to 2 years while boyfriend walks to work. Tensions have been rising due to distribution of chores and free time. I asked if we could move somewhere halfway between our respective workplaces when the lease is up in May and boyfriend opted instead to tell me to move out to my own apartment if I want to continue in this relationship.\n\nEDIT:\nThank you so much to everyone that has responded to this update post. My original post got a handful of comments and this update post blew up and I\u2019ve been so touched by the kindness I\u2019ve seen here. Even for those that said less than kind things - thank you too. I posted not for an echo chamber but to get all opinions and I appreciate the dissenting views as well.

            "\"We teach people how to treat us.\" - it's super corny but also very true.  \n\n\n This sounds like one of those relationships a person gets out of and is then able to meet someone with whom they are compatible and can be happy. You gotta start asking for more for yourself. From yourself and from your choices \\[in partners\\]. This guy has shown you what effort he's willing to put toward being your **partner** in this relationship. He's suggesting you move out. Move out. Break up. Make yourself your first priority and stay busy. You will meet someone else who is dying to make you happy and who appreciates all you do for them. This guy would rather ask you to move out than make adjustments to the relationship to help you be happy.   \n\n\nOh, and 100% take the cat with you. No discussion. It's your cat. You take care of it.",
            "I seriously doubt he wants to stay in a relationship with you. If he says he wants to live separately but not break up, he probably wants to wait until it's more convenient for him to end the relationship, or he is afraid and waiting for you to end it first. I speak from experience because I was once immature and selfish like your boyfriend.",
            "I remember your post. Still doesn't look like he will change. Especially at 32 and he wont compromise with you. It's not right. You really got to think if you want this to be another 2 years like this. If he isn't willing to change or help you out, then you have to cut it off. Leaving in separate apartments wont change nothing. He will keep his habits at his new place. But I think you should break it off. You are emotionally drain and just fed up. Don't live your life like this for another 2 years. I'm also sorry about your cat.",
            "You guys aren\u2019t compatible and may be better off separating - but that doesn\u2019t mean you wasted 2 years. You learned a lot in those two years about what you need and want out of a partner, and you\u2019ll use that knowledge to find someone you\u2019re more compatible with. \n\nYes, you love each other- but that is the baseline for being in a relationship. Love on its own doesn\u2019t make a relationship good- for that you need trust, respect, care, help, etc. It doesn\u2019t sound like you guys have that stuff - neither of you feel taken care of, neither of you trust that the other has your best interests at heart, etc. \n\nCut the cord and take care of yourself and your cat. You can do this, and you\u2019ll be better off from handling these challenges as well. It will be hard, but you\u2019ll be stronger and it will help you appreciate good times and good people that much more.",

It's clear he doesn't value your relationship enough to compromise, and that's fine.  \n\nSince he's so kindly offered to take over the lease at no penalty, take him up on the offer and start looking for places now.  Be sure to let property management know, especially if your name is on the lease.  Once you get the paperwork settled and move, well, let the relationship end.",

My ex used my sick cats as another reason to complain that I wasn\u2019t contributing enough (meanwhile he never once cleaned the rugs or couch when his dog made a mess). After living together for 2 years I stopped doing anything and grey rocked him until he had a temper tantrum and moved in with his mommy. \n\nYou deserve to be loved,respected, and seen as a partner not a personal maid.  Dump him, move closer to work for your mental health and put all your love and energy into taking care of your kitty.

            "What you\u2019ve learned is that your relationship is one of convenience for your boyfriend: everything works fine as long as it works for him. Asking him to sacrifice his comfort or time to help reduce the burdens you were facing showed you his investment into your partnership: pretty much none. You want a partner who will share worlds with you, not allow you to exist in his. \n\nWhile two years isn\u2019t an insignificant amount of time, it\u2019s a fair amount of time to invest in a relationship to find out someone\u2019s true nature and now you know it\u2019s time to focus on yourself. Live where you want to live, reclaim three hours a day, spend time with your cats (and I hope things go well there) and move on. \n\nYou\u2019re about to have an easy 15 hours a week open up in your life.

For those of us that still have an end goal of marriage or a permanent long-term relationship, dating has to be used rigorously as a test drive/audition. And I don\u2019t think somebody who is only at a place where they are willing to prioritize their self or their career is really ready for that audition.  \n\nTo be in a serious relationship is to carry the mindset that you are a team.

            "Yeah, so, here's the thing.\n\nMarriage 1 - husband was totally supportive of me going back to school until he realized I was gone 3 nights a week for class, had clinical shifts that were 12 hours, had to do a minimum 500 hour internship at 30 hours a week, AND I was still working. Guess who told me to drop out with 2 months left. Yeah. Because I wasn't coolong/cleaning/laundering/fucking on his desired schedule. Same thing when I started working and it was nights, weekends and holidays. He would deliberately leave messes for me to find first thing when I came off a 24 hour shift, and then be like \"you chose this profession, I don't care that you've been awake for close to 30 hours, fix me a sammich.\" \n\nMarriage 2 - husband went back to school full time, super intensive program. I picked up a ton of the slack, worked 80-100 hours a week, so he could focus on school and not stress about stupid shit like laundry. AND I WAS HAPPY TO DO SO, because this was an overall investment in our future. He just started a new job in his desired field, and was talking about working a second job to make some extra $, even though new job is almost a 15k raise. My response? No fucking way. You focus on your training, your mental health, and our marriage. I'll pick up the household slack, and we'll reevaluate in 6 months when your training is done if we need the extra money that bad. (spoiler: we won't)\n\nI've been thinking about going for a masters, he flat out told me under no circumstances would I be allowed to work overtime AND go to school, much less take care of chores. Our investments in our future are just that, and we have each other's backs no matter what. If I was commuting 3 hours a day? No question we would move. Our marriage is more important than keeping score, because a relationship isn't like 2 oxen in a yoke. It's almost never 50/50. Someone is almost always doing \"more\" for whatever reason. The thing is, that balance has to shift back and forth - the scale can't just be permanently tipped to one side.",
            "Hi OP, I sincerely wish you the best during this hard time. Just from reading your previous post to the update, it kind of feels like he is taking you for granted. This could be a good time to re-evaluate the relationship and honestly moving to your own apartment does sound like a good step, especially with how stressful everything\u2019s been for you and how he hasn\u2019t made it any easier.\n\nSo many couples break up after moving in together because they realize the incompatibility and it\u2019s when you truly test the relationship. I know you have been building up the relationship for the last two years, but ask yourself.. if he isn\u2019t willing to compromise or even sympathize before, what will ever change in the future? Remember, no one can change someone else and you can\u2019t expect him to change for you. Knowing that, is this something you can deal with for the rest of your life? \n\nIf you know you can deal with it and accept it, I\u2019d continue moving forward to it the relationship. But if not, it\u2019s a real good time to take a step back. You are so young and have so much time in front of you, make sure you are getting what you need out of a relationship before it turns resentful or sour.",
            "Well you tried this relationship with him  and it doesn\u2019t seem to be  working out. Time to move on. Hopefully you learned somethings and about what is important to you. He doesn\u2019t want to make the compromise of moving half way, then he doesn\u2019t have to. You both have reached a fork in the road and must choose which one to follow- only one road together or separate roads apart. That is life. You need to make the best choice for you, outside of this guy because he clearly made his- NOT a bad thing. The best part is you\u2019re not married to him, there\u2019s no children involved and that\u2019s the beautiful thing about dating, living together first before making the ultimate commitment. You learn some shit about your SO once you live together, it\u2019s all about whether you can handle those new discoveries and see them in rose colored glasses still, or not. This relationship seems to have run it\u2019s course but what do we know? We\u2019re just strangers online and life have a funny way of working things out. Ball seems to be in your court OP, good luck.",

You take care of all the car upkeep and some of the pet care but you need help with the \"mental load\" of remembering to order cat food and put gas in the car? You set a reminder in your phone to get an oil change. You have a reoccurring cat food order to chewy or amazon. Get gas when the light comes on? This is basic existence. It doesn't sound like you're doing any chores at all.",

It's not his fault you chose to pick a job so far away, and it's not his fault you are dead set on sticking it out there.  Shit still needs to get done around the house, period.  \n\nThat being said, it's a moot point now, because the live separately thing is a precursor to breaking up.",
            "This is meant to be constructive criticism, but he didn\u2019t pick the timing. You did, by allowing a very important conversation to go unresolved for years. Not to make you feel worse, but just remember part of the situation was created by your allowing it to continue.

I\u2019m thinking if you do continue to live together you can come up with a chore plan together of who does what and when so that you know what to expect when you come home.

Yeah some people get stuck temporarily having to do long distance relationships, but this isnt that. This is a straight up inability to compromise when things to work out according to plan. This is apparently still being together, but not as much as before. He'll likely expect you to drive to see him as well, I assume? So you're not cutting back on your commute unless you significantly reduce the time you spend with him. Plus, how easy will that be when you have pets to care for? You cant just leave them home all work day and then leave to his place overnight- Theres no winning, really.

Does it suck that he's happier to live apart than split a commute? Yes. But compromise is figuring out a situation in which BOTH people are happy, and it seems like that's not going to happen. He's not willing to sacrifice his happiness, and that's his right, as it is yours. This frees you to find someone who's either willing to compromise more or who is already compatible with you.",

The reality is that these people are only spitting on him because you've painted him as the villain, and he isn't here to tell his side of the story... so going off that, of course people are going to side with you.\n\nI see it differently though... I just think you two are incompatible. I don't think it's his fault and I don't think it's fair to just blame him for not being a good enough partner. You are demanding things from him in order to get your way, which is selfish in it's own way. You're asking him to uproot and live halfway between both of your jobs... You said he doesn't have a car, so that's going to be a HUGE inconvenience for him.\n\nAll I'm saying is you chose your current situation. He doesn't want to choose to worsen his situation, and I don't blame him. The only person you should be blaming is yourself for taking a job requiring you to commute that far. This sounds like a YOU problem. You keep saying this job is for both of you but the reality is it's benefiting you the most to stay with the job. You wouldn't be making that sacrifice otherwise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think it's best if you two split but I don't think it's a good idea to just shovel all the blame on to him and come out of this thinking you're now \"empowered\" or something. You need to learn from your mistakes (not in choosing him as a boyfriend, but in your life decisions in general) and you need to see things from his perspective as well. Maybe don't jump into living with someone when you don't have your own life figured out yet. Maybe give more thought to agreeing to a job that has you doing a 1.5-2 hour commute. Maybe in your next relationship be more up front and vocal about things that bother you so you don't grow resentment toward your partner.",

He just sticks to his guns and hopes eventually you'll give up and just do things his way.\n\n**GIRL**.\n\nThere's over 9 billion people in the world. our current partner is not your best, last great hope at love and a lifetime relationship, even in a 10 mile radius.

            "This approach seems so backward and nitpicky. \"I drive more for my job so you should do more chores!\"? There must be deeper problems, because I can't imagine this being the core issue. It begs questions, like do you shift chore responsibility based on:  who earns more, who has a more lively social circle, who has more family obligations, who does more volunteer work? I don't see how you just tie chores to commute.\n\nThat said, your bf sounds like he has some real issues and loves you for what (he thinks) you can give him rather than how he can love and serve you.

            "It does seem like you're starting the breakup process.  So one thing to consider is where you'd live if the relationship is over.  If his new apartment suggestion happens to match up with what you would (or will) do without him, then one option is to go ahead and make that happen, and then leave the next step up to him - instead of continuing to cater to him.\n\nYou may need a clean break in order to really move on, but there are also advantages to taking a little time to find the right apartment, and to move with a little less urgency.  You can be honest about it being a step towards breaking up, but in the meantime maybe it will be possible to have some decent but melancholy time together.\n\nIf you do take your time, it's important not to compromise on where you move to in order to cater to your boyfriend.",
            "Its definitely not a easy process especially when you feel like you\u2019ve given 100% into this relationship and gone beyond what you could do for this person, but think of this as the first huge step for you in your life. A healthy life. Which you need. Times like this you really need to put yourself first. If he\u2019s not the right guy to appreciate the things you have done for him, then try to think of this as a positive thing and better now than later, when it could\u2019ve been a lot worse. I\u2019m glad you are in the mindset of moving on. It can only get better from here so keep your chin high!",
            "I was in a relationship where my partner suggested living separately (after living together for a year) and stay together.. And I tried it for a while.\n\nIt WAS a prelude to breaking up. It hurt a lot. Knowing my partner couldn't be straightforward and honest with me. Knowing they wanted things other than a future with me.\n\nBut the past is the past, and with hindsight being 20/20, I can say I dodged a bullet. My ex partner did me a favor. I see things about her that I did not see when I was with her. \n\nOP, tell your bf that if you move out, you're done. Don't let him convince you otherwise - move out, go no contact, distance yourself, get your priorities in focus, and work on finishing school and grabbing your great job. \n\nThe positive in every breakup is what you take away from it. In the future, you'll recognize unfair sharing of chores is a huge red flag, and that when you communicate an issue to your partner and they brush it off, something is wrong.\n\nI know it hurts right now, but it will be okay, and one day you'll look back on this and realize you are far better off. \n\nBest of luck to you, and I hope your kitty is doing well!",

            "I'm sorry but I think you both are wrong.\n\nAbout you, having more commute time is not an excuse to contribute less in the chores. Also you made the point that he only has to walk to validate your statment.\n\nAbout him, not accepting your proposal to move halfway and suggesting you to move to your own aparment is wrong. It's like him showing no interest in you.\n\nBut, overwall, I think the main point here is that the commute time seems to be a problem you both have had for a while and now it has become a pride-problem. You both are pulling without thinking in the other one. The string will break, sooner or later, you should discuss all your options before that happens.\n\nAlso, having your own aparment doesn't mean it's a breakup while in the long run I see, not doing 50-50 in the chores, a major problem.",

For the day off today we decided to order dinner for takeout, and when my mom told me her order I asked her if I should put in an order for Kim as well. My mom asked why I thought Kim would be eating dinner with us, so I told her they hang out so much Kim is practically her girlfriend and I'm really happy for them both and they don't need to hide it from me.\n\nTurns out I was right about my mom dating a woman but wrong about it being Kim. About the same time she met Kim, she also met Jin at a professional conference of hers, and they've been dating for a few months now. My mom invited Jin over to dinner and it turns out they kept all their mushy stuff on my mom's smartphone, I knew they were friends but turns out half the time my mom's 'gone out to dinner with a friend' lately it's been Jin.\n\nMy mom hadn't told me for a few reasons. She grew up in a super conservative area and was kinda forced to marry my dad right after high school. She's not sure if she's bi or gay or has an exception or what, she's still working through a lot of stuff about how she feels and what she wants to call herself.\n\nShe also didn't want to tell me until I turned 18 because she's pretty sure my grandparents and aunts and uncles will disown her when she comes out, and make me choose. My mom wanted to wait until I was legally an adult and could make my own decisions about my relationships with my family. \n\nI hugged my mom and told her I don't give a shit what some hateful, miserable antediluvian cretins yammering from the primordial ooze say, she's my mom and she's awesome and I love her and Jin seems like a great woman. I told her that if the crabs in the bucket want to pull her back down, make crab cakes with rainbow sprinkles.\n\nJin laughed her head off but my mom asked me to please not say anything in public. She's working through personal shit and she'll come out in public when she's ready, so I promised I wouldn't say a word to anyone.\n\nExcept to you guys, there was so much awesome advice. Thank you, reddit!\n\nEDIT: To whom it concerns, 'Kim' and 'Jin' are of course not their real names, and I've fudged how long my mom's known these people for.\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: right about my mom dating a woman, wrong about which woman, mom's working through personal stuff before she comes out publicly but knows I love and support her",

            "So yeah you ignored my advice as a woman in pretty much your mum\u2019s situation and age bracket to not forcibly out her and dismissed her incredibly valid fears about being out and the very real trauma many women of her generation experienced about their sexuality. Babe, in my Western country they could institutionalise you for life for this and that leaves wounds. Deep fucking wounds. And I can\u2019t really mention the other sexual trauma around sub rules.\n\nYou are not supporting and being an ally if you dragged it out of your mum while she begged you not to out her further and made a big dramatic speech about how primordial the bigots are. Wait til you learn that\u2019s your grandparents, her boss, your teachers, half her friends and you are going to be so torn that they are nice to you but made her feel closeted and scared for decades.\n\nYou are way out of your depth, you followed the advice of a bunch of cishet people who thought this was a Netflix special and you ignored every single cue that your mum really did not want to discuss this but you pushed her into inviting Jin since it\u2019s been like three days since your post.\n\nIf your mom had done that her 17 year old working through their sexuality the \u2018no contact\u2019 flag would be flying. Allies are only allies if they listen to what the people they profess to support need instead of decide what is best for them.\n\nNone of the \u2018rainbow sprinkle crab cake\u2019 it\u2019s all got better now people when I came out at 36F did shit when shit actually hit the fan. Turns out real life isn\u2019t as Pride month cute as they thought and it gets boring when they \u2018you go girl\u2019 and I say stop because my estranged family are calling the cops on me for having a GF. In a different country.\n\nYou are 17 and you mean well but the road to hell is paved with good intentions and this rainbow sprinkle naivety is a toxic positivity that objectifies queerness and its history, future and present to a harmful degree. You need to stay in your lane and let your mom be herself. I bet you expect the same courtesy from her including not having to disclose your crushes, sex life and personal insecurities because she snooped your internet search history?\n\nLearn some boundaries. Your mom was so fearful of you snooping she has led a double life for months and yup, she was right you would make it a big deal thus putting massive pressure on her and the relationship with Jin. The adult here did read the room\u2026.",

            "So it sounds like all's well that ends well. I'm glad you got resolution. And it sounds like your mom is in a good place.\n\nSide note: your mom knows whether she's bi or gay. If you're incapable of being sexually attracted to a gender, then you can't be bi. If you're literally capable of being sexually attracted to both, then you're bi. It's pretty simple, really. Whether someone will admit their true predilections is a different matter. But I assure you she knows.",

You deserve to be treated with empathy and kindness, because it brings more healing and strength than mean words. \n  \nMy only advice is this: don\u2019t think about these two years as wasted. You needed to experience that to be who you are today, and you are already a more self-aware adult. The French system puts so much pressure on students at this one life stage, as if everyone is the same. But you simply needed more time to figure things out, and that is completely okay.

            "I was chatting with some people much younger than me (I'm 34 and they were mostly between 17-22). They were talking about how they felt like failures and like they hadn't accomplished anything with their life. I told them to not worry about living up to other's standards, just do your best and try to enjoy the perks that come with being that young. I told them I didn't really start getting my shit together until I was about 30 and I'm still learning. I told them to focus on taking care of their body and not going into debt.",

Now you can decide exactly what you want to do or try different things until you find what makes you happy. Congratulations on getting your license!

            "I am so glad that you found something you enjoy! Many people can feel aimless and dejected when they do not see a future and do not have the passion for what they are studying or working. \n\nThis is completely normal and you need time to discover what suits you and makes you excited to get up every morning. I had many friends who went to college only to hate their courses or loved their courses but hated the job. \n\nThe only way to find out is to try! Try the courses and try the job. You never know what it is like until u are immersed in it. Plus certificates always open doors, even in unrelated fields because it shows the employers that you were disciplined, dedicated and committed to something long term. Something which employers definitely look for.\n\nI wish you all the best!!! I am so proud of you for the courage to take the road less travelled and chase your dreams!",

That is a big deal. \nDon't be so hard on yourself.\nConfidence will bring you your next love.\nGood luck.\nYou're still so young. Enjoy these years. Dress well and look after your body. One day you'll k back and say 'look how handsome I was when I was in my 20's'.\nGood luck to you. Well done",
            "There\u2019s a poster in this thread that\u2019s been downvoted because he\u2019s being unnecessarily harsh on your ex. \n\nBut what I think he is trying to suggest is that you look at your CURRENT friendship with your ex girlfriend. Are you really only friends... or do you expect / wish that she will one day come back to you?\n\nI was concerned that you mentioned she\u2019s the only one that could make you laugh etc... this would be ok I think if you HAD dated other people since then, but it makes me worry that you\u2019re still in love with her! And this might be preventing you from really moving on and finding someone new.",

I once dated a guy whom I felt was out of my league and I got bored by his cuteness because his personality was just meh. I lost interest pretty quickly.",

You need to stop being so hard on yourself, though.\n\n>\t(BTS in France if you care, it\u2019s not much but it\u2019s alright.)\n\nThat tells us that you don\u2019t really believe in yourself and you\u2019re simply taking baby steps because you feel like you can\u2019t do anything meaningful. Well, sometimes baby steps is the way to better yourself as a whole. For me, I do not make giant leaps. I like to acclimate myself into the things I first get into before I take the next step. \n\n>\tMy ex-girlfriend ended up dating someone else richer and more handsome than me, but whatever.\n\nYou 2 are still very young. You 2 were (and still are) in your early 20s. You date a bunch of different people so that you find out who is right for you. It\u2019s like shopping for a car. You test drive a bunch of different cars before you decide on the one that you are comfortable with, like the look, like the feel of the drive, etc. You date many people to see whose personality fits in with yours. Don\u2019t let her dating someone \u201cricher and more handsome\u201d than you be a negative. \n\nIt absolutely sounds like you are on the right path to finding out what will make you live a good life. Keep going. It can be slow, but you are literally building your path to that happy life.",
            "You actually made all the hard moves so far, which was realizing you had a problem and focusing on yourself.  You can't be in a good relationship if you aren't happy with yourself.  Good luck and I hope you keep making progress.  Being single and working on your goals is one of the biggest things I miss.  It's obviously still possible now but I have to always consider another person too",

            " \n\nHI\n\nI read tarot cards for a living and pulled some cards for you, I hope you don't mind.\n\n1: 10 of cups\n\n2: 5 of pentacles\n\n3: The Devil\n\nSo these cards are saying that you are emotionally and spiritually content on the path that you are on. However, due to a fear of losing it all or being financially broke (5 of coins) you are continuing to allow this pattern of not achieving in this world to run your life AKA The Devil. He is the card that comes to play when you have trouble letting go of old patterns or are restricting yourself. I just want to say as someone who doesn't even know you that you deserve all that this life has to offer. Money is just an energy, Success in this world is just an energy. You can draw it in if you choose to. Or you can also choose to deny it. Pay attention to the way that you feel towards money and success. Are you denying or short changing yourself every chance that you get or are you saying yes to the blessings at every opportunity? And \"please give me more\"!\n\nXOXO\n\nJaylene\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can find me on Facebook or Instagram for continued insight.\n\n My name is mystic.modern",

You need to fully move on from the past \n\nAnd \n\n2. She\u2019s not worth your time...I mean she stopped supporting you and being their for you...she gave you an ultimatum instead of being patient and focusing on your many positives not to mention she was a hypocrite because I\u2019m extremely sure she had her flaws but she instead was getting on you for yours...she was selfish and gave up on you..doesn\u2019t sound like a good person to have around and definitely not a good person to be friends with.\n\n\nAlso you are attractive enough to find someone else..I mean you found your ex right? Then you\u2019ll find someone else just give it time.\n\nRight now you need to cut your ex out of your life and focus on getting treatment for you metal health and practicing self compassion and love then eventually get back out in the dating field to find a better girl than your ex (she\u2019s out there waiting on you..you just gotta go get her) \n\n\nI\u2019ll say this again you weren\u2019t \u201cbroken\u201d and needed to fix yourself thinking like that is an unhealthy way of viewing mental health issues..you\u2019re just struggling and need some help that\u2019s all..your just being human.\n\n\nBest of luck man. \ud83d\udc4c"
