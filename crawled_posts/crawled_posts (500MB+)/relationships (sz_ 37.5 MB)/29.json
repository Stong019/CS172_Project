I wanted to thank you all once more for your help and support on the situation with my brother and his now ex-fiance. I took your advice and let him know that I support him and just want him to be happy, him and the ex fiance had a huge fight and we're getting all his belongings picked up today. \n\nHe's doing really well and it will probably take him a long time to heal from this but he's the happiest and most relaxed I've seen him in a long time. After everything blew over I showed him my post and he left a little message for you all. \n\nHeyoooo (its the brother in question) gotta say the one thung my brother got wrong was the reconiciliation for the past month.

She was the worst. She cheated on him, and lied about anything and everything, including being pregnant to guilt him into staying with her when he tried to leave. It took everything I had to keep my cool after I found out about that. He's my baby brother and I've always been fiercely protective over him. He met the most wonderful woman I could have asked the universe to send him a few years later and they now have a beautiful 6 year old daughter. \n\nThank you for the update and I wish you and your family the best of luck in the future!",

            "Whatever you do, DO NOT GET BACK TOGETHER WITH HER!!!! My brother dated the same kind of girl. We breathed a huge sigh of relief when they broke up. She kept him from visiting, talking on the phone, emailing etc. Then they got back together because he was bored, didn\u2019t find another girl to date or whatever his reasoning was. They got married. She immediately got pregnant with an unplanned baby. They moved far away. She got pregnant with a second unplanned baby. They live states away from us and we rarely talk or see him or the kids. She criticizes everything about him. She doesn\u2019t seem to like him much, and she hates us. My brother and I were super close and now I rarely see or speak to him because of her. It\u2019s breaks my heart. Break off all contact and block her on everything. My brother is miserable and I don\u2019t want you to end up the same way.",

Its not easy, and he will have withdrawls, but with the support of your wonderful family, he will get through this. Please tell him not to jump into a new relationship quickly. It is very important for him to work on himself and to understand why he let someone treat him so badly. Most probably he suffers from very low self esteem. Seeing a therapist is not the worst idea for him.\n\nKudos to you for being there for him even after he (and his fiancee) hurt your family so badly.

I told my husband, shortly after I posted the story here because I was feeling very anxious and he was going to pick up on that anyway. I don't think I have to say that my husband was livid, I never saw him like that before. After a lot of talking, I ended up learning a lot about the relationship between him and BIL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo keep things short, BIL is a huge asshole who has ruined relationships for my husband in the past. The only reason he didn't ruin ours was because my husband put a lot of distance between himself and his own family. His family by the way, always chalked it all up to sibling rivalry and never did anything to help, so I don't blame him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What happened after:** My husband called BIL and asked him to not contact us anymore, he only wanted him to apologize to me for dragging me into this. BIL denied his request saying it was just a joke and I should be able to take one like a grown up. He hung up on us and that was that for a few days, until we received a call from my MIL who was very angry. BIL had told her and my FIL what had happened and that he was very upset that he couldn't even make jokes without my husband making a big deal out of it. So MIL was calling to say that we and my BIL's family weren't going to be invited to family gatherings anymore until everything was solved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told my husband about the call and he was surprisingly calm this time around, saying that it was the usual behavior and that if I wanted to he would make an effort but he didn't care very much. At this point I was angry myself because I never saw this behavior in his family before and it was etremely frustrating. I told him not to bother and that it would be up to him to decide. We kept mostly to ourselves since and nobody reached out to us either. Until monday, when my FIL called us to say that BIL was invited to spend christmas with the family because his wife was pregnant. He only wanted to make sure that we knew this because he didn't want us showing up to \"ruin everyone's good time\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe and my husband ended up laughing about it later because it was so absurd. But I noticed that it has taken a toll on my husband's mood and I'm debating suggesting therapy for him because I feel like there's a lot he doesn't feel comfortable telling me. We're going to spend christmas with my parents and I hope my husband will be able to tune out from this entire situation and have a good time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR BIL said it was a joke but he was offended that we didn't take it as such. Shared with the family what had happened and eveyone ended up getting banned from family gatherings. Except now BIL can go home for christmas because his wife is pregnant. We cannot because we would ruin the party.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit 1:** I didn't expect this to get the attention it did. I've been reading the comments and I want to say thank you to everyone who shared resources to help us moving foward. A lot of people have  also been telling their own stories and I can't answer them all but know that I read it and your advices are being heard. This has helped me to get some perspective as I cannot share what happened with my close friends. My husband is aware of this post and he will read it in his own time, right now we will be focusing on the holidays and he would rather deal with it once the celebrations are over. Thank you once again to everyone!",

He called to rub it in that BIL is the golden child and your husband is the scapegoat. Really, the only thing to do is to support your husband however he decides to deal with his family. If he wants to ghost the famdamily, so be it. Your husband might benefit from some personal counselling as he processes getting shut out by his family. You and your husband know perfectly well that BIL was not joking. He has an unhealthy obsession with the women your husband has been involved with. ",
            "Sounds like your BIL is the Golden Child and your husband is the Scapegoat. Your husband is probably holding back multiple instances where their parents picked his brother over him, and this is just the final straw. \n\nWhy would you be showing up to ruin christmas? Why would they phrase it that way? Because in their heads his refusal to see that BIL is great and doesn\u2019t do anything wrong is bad. \n\nGo enjoy Christmas with your family. Make sure your husband feels loved and supported and knows that he is in the right here. Don\u2019t let your in laws manipulate you into sweeping this all under the rug. ",
            "I am not exactly the most favored member of my family, to put it mildly.  I could give a long list of instances where my siblings were preferred or promoted in front of me, but honestly, it would just take too long.\n\nSo let me assure you: distance is good.  Therapy for your husband is good, because you can make all the smart decisions, but it doesn't mean it still doesn't hurt when your parents pick a visibly toxic sibling over you, because you chose to call them on their shit.  He's going to need to talk to someone about it, and just help develop some coping tools.\n\nIn the meantime, enjoy a day in your jammies until you head to your parents' place.  It's not an under-rated way to spend Christmas, I assure you.",
            "Sounds like you are both best off separating yourselves from his family.  WTF kind of mom enables sex jokes to her daughter in law from her other son?\n\nI am NC with my sister and VLC with my Dad over their \u201cjokes\u201d and other issues that could be resolved with a simple apology.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the right answer is for your husband, if he wants to do therapy, by all means.\n\nMe, there\u2019s no level of therapy that will give me a decent family, so I\u2019ve long detached myself and moved on.",

            "Your husband might be interested in /r/raisedbynarcissists\n\nAnd for you there is /r/justnomil\n\nAnd yes, therapy might benefit your husband, I wish both of you the best of luck. ",
            "Wow. His family is *deeply* dysfunctional. \n\nI think you\u2019re better off just dropping the lot of them. But I definitely agree with therapy for your husband. This will be hard for him, since I imagine he still held out a bit of hope that someday, maybe, his parents would wake up and see his brother for who he really is. That they\u2019d be sorry for not supporting him when his brother was deliberately ruining his life. That there might be actual consequences someday for his brother\u2019s behavior. \n\nLetting go of that hope, however faint it was, is going to be painful. If he\u2019s not comfortable talking to you about it, then a neutral third party is a good idea. Make sure to shop around until he finds one he clicks with. It may take a few tries, but it\u2019ll be worth it if he can start unpacking his feelings about his family in a safe space. It sounds like there\u2019s a lot buried in that baggage. There\u2019s no shame in asking for help.",
            "What an asshole. Your in laws are pathetically manipulated. He\u2019s behavior is so fucking predictable it\u2019s sad. \n\nThe only defense I could see if you feel like you need to stick it to his parents. Is that you don\u2019t give a shit if it\u2019s a joke and you aren\u2019t childish for being offended. And if they wanna condone in appropriate behavior from BIL they can do it without being in contact with you guys. \n\nBut honestly this sounds like the pattern of the family. Golden child and scapegoat. The golden child can get away with almost anything. ",
            "Man it would be *really* hard for me to resist sending an embarassing passive aggressive gift for them to open in front of the family.  \n\"Since you all are so open minded about this lifestyle, we thought we'd buy the four of you a 1-year membership to the local swinger's club!\" with a fake gift certificate.  \n\nJoking aside, you guys handled it well. Distance is the best medicine here.",
            "Gaslighting? **Check.**  \nCompletely and arrogantly throwing your discomfort's validity out the window, even though it was 100% valid to be uncomfortable in that situation? **Check.**  \nTrying to actively punish you for setting healthy boundaries (confronting your BIL) by using guilt in a petty way and deflecting any kind of responsability, while simultaneously doing all the things above? **Check.**  \nThat is a good, old and classic *'toxic family'* case right there. **Textbook case.**  \nThe fact that such unfair, mean, and let's admit, illogical attempts to guilt and manipulate orchestrated by his entire family managed to took toll on him shows that 1) his family is *highly dysfunctional / toxic* (considering that *he only managed to build and mantain a relationship when he distanced himself from his family* should offer a clue to that) and 2) he is still vulnerable to this toxicity.  \nNow, I'm serious when I say this: being emotionally vulnerable or dependent on a toxic family is **extremely damaging** to one's emotional health.  \nI say that because I'm going through this myself. Therapy helped me a lot and, by my experience, you husband needs therapy as well. By their behavior, cutting ties with his family would be almost a no-brainer to me, but this is a thing that your husband needs to evaluate and process himself.",
            "Just love and support your husband. Reassure him that he is the normal one and that, unfortunately, his family is toxic, but that that\u2019s not his fault. I\u2019d start going little/no contact with whole lot of them. And good riddance!",

            "Your brother in law needs to SERIOUSLY learn some key adult skills. For one, he should have known that asking something like that in the first place was crossing way too many lines. And he should have owned up to his mistake and apologized for making you feel so uncomfortable and anxious. He sounds like he's a bit off his rocker. I'm sorry you've had to deal with all this.",

Honestly, just cutting this bullshit out of your lives is probably overall the best.",
            "I've had a LOT of experience with familial dysfunction, drama from non-traditional marriages/households and such and so I'm going to try and give you the best advice I can here. I've read a lot of horrible advice about poking a hornet's nest full of crazy, making snide comments about the paternity of SIL's fetus, etc ...\n\nLook,bottom line, you married into a wild ass family with a lot of dysfunction. I think all families have their degree of issues, but girl...you hit the jackpot. LUCKILY, your husband seems to be the family oddball/black sheep, which is a good thing for you- all things considered.\n\nThey're nutty and dysfunctional and if I had to place a bet , I'd say they are all totally uninterested in changing, or therapy or any of that shit so...\n\nKeep it light with this bunch. Love em from a distance. Your husband, thank God, seems to have come to terms with all this already, and isn't forcing you all to be part of their madness. Essentially, don't give them a second thought. I wouldn't suggest making any of their weird shit a hill to die on , or even be disturbed about. \n\nThey're into all their own shit. You guys aren't, and that's all ok- you can all be happy independent of one another. \n\nChalk it, and any inevitable future craziness up to \" they're nutty ASF\ud83d\ude02\", and go about your happy life with your husband who is well aware already.\n\nIt's the best you can do. There simply is no changing , arguing with, or winning with this type of dysfunction. Learn how to let it go in one ear and out the other- IF you absolutely HAVE TO deal with them- and do not let it spill into you and your family's life and happiness. Do your thing, let them do theirs. ",

It\u2019s really my borther\u2019s wife, but she is someone that clashed with me and my wife constantly.  It was sooooo hard for me to try and bridge the gap and \u201ckeep the family together\u201d but in the end, I am so happy I stopped caring.  There is room for reconciliation, but the distance has been nice.",
            "I'm impressed with your husband for being so reasonable, having come from such a ridiculous and obnoxious family. \n\nIt sounds like you two more or less have this under control, and I agree that you could suggest that the two of you or just he could talk through some of this drama with a therapist because there's a lot going on there.\n\nBut, I mean, if your husband isn't too upset about this, and you're doing okay, then I mean, not every drama requires a mental health intervention.

Treat the Christmas period as a well-deserved break for you both. Look after each other. \n\nTherapy decisions and a discussion of whether to go NC (I would, cos fuck that noise, but your DH might not be there yet) can be scheduled for a fixed date early in New Year.\n\nJust sounds to me like you both deserve to switch off from the situation for a little while.",

            "I'd be tempted to tell them.\"no,we're definitely going to show up at Christmas. See you on the day\"... With no intention of going in the first place.\n\nThen turn your phones off and have a great day.\n\nThey won't be. ",
            "Woah... Coming from us, a couple that are usually pretty open with sexual deviancies, this crosses a huge line. Sadly I didn't see this post before, I would have commented.\n\nYour BIL wants to bang you. I don't see anybody else really mentioning this but yeah, this is basically what's going on. Obviously you won't cheat on your hubby, so to him this is the next best thing. \n\nThis is incredibly inappropriate on so many levels. Again, me and my partner are pretty open about this stuff but it even grosses us out. \n\nAs for his family, it sounds like they don't have the full story, and even if they did...wow. That opens a whole new can of worms. Are they being complicit in this sort of thing because they find the idea of two brothers wife-swapping to be acceptable? Do they also secretly want to join in? \n\nHonestly with behavior like this, I'm actually afraid for your safety if you did go over, so nothing lost I guess. Please don't go over.\n\nGo have Christmas with your own (OP the wife's) family. Or, worst case, spend it with some close friends.\n\nAfter Christmas, I would recommend some counseling for your husband, because like somebody else mentioned, he's probably been subjected to a lifetime of gaslighting, which is now only coming to light because of how obscene things are. Personally I would ghost or gray rock them until the end of time over this, but that's easy for me to say.\n\nEww.\n\nAlso, they may have seemed normal before, but in our experience people with certain proclivities usually live very very \"vanilla-looking\" lifestyles. Don't judge a book by its cover. These people will change completely once the doors are closed. ",
            "It does NOT matter at all if it was meant as a joke. If it made you uncomfortable he owes you and your brother an apology. If it was really a joke he would say so and follow it with an \"I'm so sorry I didn't mean to offend and it won't happen again\" or something along those lines. People can't always read others and jokes that aren't appropriate are told, but adults own up to their mistakes and apologize. This is a good show of how this family operates and it would be good to try counseling with your husband if you feel he's bothered by it or other things you might not be aware of at the moment. You are not required to take this kind of joking simply because others are shit heads. ",
            "Therapy would be a fantastic thing for your husband.  My grandparents almost let my dad go to jail in the 60s for things my uncle did.  It took my dad years to be able to step back and see his family didn't care for him.

I knew that I wanted to tell my friends the story of my past, and I knew they would react pretty well, and I knew they'd be supportive and we'd remain close friends. I really just didn't know how to bring it up after SIX months. I don't know if I expressed it in my first post, but 6 months is kind of a long time, I feel so close to these people in so many ways, so mostly it was just weird to me to not be able to casually mention my family. I absolutely still have days where it's hard to get out of bed and I just want to be left alone to cry in the dark, but so many times I think of happy memories with my family, and adorable things Veronica did that I'm reminded of and I want to be able to pepper those into my conversations. I struggled with HOW to tell people. One on one? Big group dinner? Email? So I actually emailed them all the day after my first post here and invited them over for dinner the next night if they could make it on short notice. I said to please bring their SOs, but told Kelly I'd explain later why I think she shouldn't bring her kids this time. Honestly I was just afraid she'd get really upset and wouldn't want her kids to see her like that. She couldn't get a sitter, so her husband stayed home with the kids, but Brenda and Luke brought their SOs, and I made a huge pot of chili and some cornbread. I feel like they sensed something was up, because honestly I thought the odds of them all being able to come with one day's notice was unusual. \n\nThey showed up early evening, we sat in my living room (tight quarters!) and had some wine, and then I started. I'm an awkward person, so I basically said \"I have some big information about my past that I really want to share with you. It's not something that I share with everyone I meet and it's hard to bring up, but now so much time has gone by and I feel so close to you all, and I really want you to know this part of my life. I think it'll be emotional for you all to hear about, and I think it'll slightly change our dynamic for a while, but I'm also really excited to share this with you.\" A couple of the girls were already teary. I didn't know if they'd googled me and already knew what I was going to say, or if they could just sense the emotion in my voice. I wanted the next part to be really blunt and not beat around the bush and first set it up so they wouldn't see where I was going. I said, 3 years ago my husband, 2 year old daughter and I were in a car accident when I was 5 months pregnant. My husband and daughter were killed instantly, and I lost the son I was carrying, but was otherwise physically okay.\n\nEveryone was silently sobbing at this point, including me. I told them why I moved away, why I wanted to start fresh, and why now I needed them to know my story. Kelly got up and came over and sat on the floor by my feet and cried into my lap for a while. I stroked her hair and told her it was okay, and that her kids are the first kids I had contact with since Veronica and it genuinely gave me so much joy to be around them, and that the only thing I would change is that I'd like to share stories about our kids, talk about what Veronica liked to play with or the \"words\" she would say, diaper rash. We were all still crying, but there was a lot of smiling and joking too. I tried to break the ice a little bit with Kelly and said \"you know what this means right? I have had a baby and still look hot in a bikini!\" We giggled, she said OMG I can't believe I said that, I said I take it as a compliment and assured them all I would not hold anything against them they said previously that in the light of this new information could now be seen as offensive. \n\nIt wrapped up so neatly like a goddamn sit com! I mean, they are good people and I knew it would. With all I've been through I'm choosey about who I let into my life and I could tell they were good people who would react well, but they've also all been friends for SO long, it always kind of feels like I'm the new kid and we aren't on equal footing. I am glad I told them all together though, instead of telling them individually. I honestly don't think I could have handled that emotionally, going through it took a lot out of me. \n\nBrenda actually said that when we first met and she was looking up to see if I had Facebook, she came across a headline about my accident but didn't click on it because the headline was so horrific and she assumed it was just someone with the same name. We finally ate chili around 10:30. I do think they'll tread lightly around me for a while, but I also think this is going to bring us closer. And I don't intend to bring my family up often, but I'm glad now I can share stories about my wedding planning, childbirth, breastfeeding, etc. I never wanted someone that I could cry to about missing my family. Honestly....that's mine and mine alone. I still go to therapy, so I'm not keeping it inside, but it just doesn't work for me to express my grief over my loss to others. Thanks for helping me talk this out Reddit.\n\nThank you to those of you who sent me PMs sharing your own losses or just wishing me well. I could not have had this particular conversation with anyone in my real life. You were really here for me. That means a lot.\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: I spilled my guts to my friends and it went as well as I could imagine. I think it'll bring us much closer.",

Maybe they want to announce it on Chinese New Year.\n\nBut when my brother asked me what I wanted to eat on Chinese New Year I gave him a list of wedding foods and he asked me if I was getting married. But he's just been laughing at me and my brother the whole time. \n\nSo we've just been annoying each other back and forth until he bought us ice cream to shut us up but he did give us hugs out of the blue today so I think I'll just leave it at that and they can take their own time with whatever it is they have going on.\n\nBut I do kind of want to tease him about it because I have little sister privileges and I can only abuse them for another year.  \n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Update, looks like there's already something going on and they are coming for Chinese New Year but my brother is being coy.",

A background piece not included in my original post is that all the players in this scenario are connected by a recovery community. Because of this connection, I knew the \"ex\", Ashley, some years ago and we were still on one another's social media. I decided to reach out and ask about James.\n\nThat evening Ashley called me and we then conferenced in James. As it turns out, he is married to another woman and they have a child. He and Ashley never dated and aren't even really friends, they simply used to chat at a large meeting that was also attended by my friend, Wendy. They believe that she saw them speaking there and created a delusion that they had dated and Ashley was now poisoning James against Wendy, all the while he was married to another woman.\u00a0\n\nOver the course of the last two years, Wendy has approached James at multiple meetings with declarations of love. He reiterated to her each time that he was married and stopped attending that meeting to avoid her. But oddly, she ended up at his meetings again and again. She approached his sponsor and friends telling them they were in love. She also approached Ashley threatening her with a restraining order because she believed Ashley was conspiring against James and her, as a couple, because they were \"together\" now. The second time she approached her, six months ago, Ashley called the police and made a report.\u00a0\n\nUntil our conference call, Ashley and James didn't realize how they were connected and they didn't know the extent of the delusions. When I told them about the marriage date, they were very concerned. James called the police.\n\nI called the emergency mental health line looking for help, but their only suggestion was to call the police and ask for a welfare check on Wendy, which I did. Knowing that she has no connection to James and is living in a complete delusion made me so concerned for her. Once the wedding date came and she didn't get married, what would happen? How would she mentally process that?\u00a0\n\nI was given a reference number and when I called back, was told they made contact but did not intake her since she didn't appear dangerous. Since the check, she has ignored my calls. The wedding date came and passed and I heard nothing. At this time I feel like I lost a friend, but she was already gone in these delusions and I did what I could to help.\u00a0\n\nGoing forward, I hope to get updates from other people in the community that she is doing better, and hopefully abandons these delusions.\n\nTL;DR: There was no wedding or relationship, James is a real person with no connection to Wendy, she was fully delusional.\u00a0",

            "Wow. Thanks for the update OP. I hope that she gets the help she needs and well done for joining the dots on this before she did anything more sinister. ",
            "This happened with my (schizophrenic) and one of her professors. She really thought they had a relationship, he of course was freaked out due to him being married and the school having rules against dating students. For my sister this was just one of many issues she had until we managed to get her into treatment.\n\nIf possible see if you can reach out to her family, as they'll have more options on how to deal with this (not a lot of options, but definitely more). ",
            "OP, what\u2019s safest for you is to worry about taking care of yourself. She doesn\u2019t seem like a safe friend. She\u2019s not your sponsor. She has bigger problems than you can handle. \n\nYou did the right thing with this situation. ",
            "Wow, I\u2019m so impressed with how you handled this situation. You\u2019ve done the absolute best you can and have been an extraordinary friend to her. Time to move on, though, and continue to take good care of yourself. ",
            "You're describing an erotomanic delusion. Could either be delusional disorder or a symptom of another disorder (schizophrenia or bipolar disorder). Alcohol and drug abuse are known risk factors, as is low SES. \n\nPeople with delusional disorder can be fairly high functioning overall. Treatment is therapy, though they often resist due to poor insight. Antipsychotics can be somewhat helpful for some people, but usually do little more than help decrease anxiety or agitation associated with the delusion. It is a hard disorder to treat, especially if it has been going on for years. She is unlikely to simply \"give up\" on it, but with treatment may be able to develop some insight and question the delusional beliefs. \n\nLetting her family or sponsor know would be reasonable next steps. It is not productive to confront someone directly about a delusion, but you also don't want to encourage her. Your best bet is simply to validate and empathize with her feelings. \"I can see you're disappointed that the wedding you were looking forward to didn't happen.\" ",
            "Wow. I'm really sorry for everyone involved.\n\nIf I was James r Ashley I'd frankly be concerned and feel unsafe. James should really shut down his social media and talk to friends/family about doing the same so this woman doesn't find his \"secret family\" (ie his real wife and innocent vulnerable child). Who knows how she would react to him having a child with another woman? ",
            "It's insane how this person is literally Murello from OITNB. I can't help but picture her in this whole story! Seriously though, thanks for the update and for handling this all so well, you did good",
            "Have you reached out to her family or other close friends? Although I imagine they know. (Or sadly, could even be just as deluded as she is.)   \n\n\nIn any case, there is sadly not much you can do, apart from possibly that IF you think it might be an option. Hopefully she eventually gets help. I am very sorry you've lost her as a friend.",
            "Wendy sounds like my husband.  He hasn\u2019t lived with me and our son for over 6 years.  Exactly right now I have him on speaker phone while I am typing this.  He believes cops, firemen, ambulances follow him everywhere when he is out.  He thinks the gov\u2019t sends them out to follow people they feel are crazy.  He has delusions of women chasing him at work wanting to be with him and then the next day they are witches putting curses on him.  He fights with any and everyone.  He has a great job makes over $27 an hr worked there over 20 yrs.  Thankfully his work has a union and they know he has mental illness.  I care for him but could no longer live with him.  He mercilessly accused me day and night of cheating with any man....coworkers, neighbors, his brother.....literally would get physically abusive and break things in our house.  I could not believe I was fighting and fearing for my life over a delusion......  Problem is you cannot help them if they don\u2019t want help.  No cops, or psychiatrist will not do anything until they physically harm someone or kill them.",

            "Thanks for the update, this was a weird one, eh? I\u2019m a clinical social worker and actually had a feeling this may be a genuine delusional disorder, which it really seems likely to be. It\u2019s broadly called \u201cerotomania\u201d when a person has an ongoing delusion that a person is in love with them. I can\u2019t diagnose your friend obviously, but my gut says she\u2019s genuinely ill. Delusional disorders like this are extremely difficult to treat, sadly. ",
            "Really glad you contacted them, OP. You acted as a good friend to all three, I hope you feel that way.\nI don\u2019t know for sure, but it might be a good idea for someone to tell her sponsor. \n\nBut back to you...& back to your life!

            "Wow. I\u2019m sorry about you\u2019re friend. It\u2019s really kind of you to try and get the story together to try and help her. This event really reminded me of \u201cThe Daemon Lover\u201d by Shirley Jackson.",
            "Thanks for an update!",
            "Wow, I'm sorry to hear that. I do hope eventually she gets the help she needs and realizes you were really being a good friend to her. \n\nIf you do care for her keep reaching out every so often to try and keep in touch. She was delusional, but there's still the person there you had a friendship with somewhere, hopefully. Maybe you'll see her again.",
            "This is so sad- I totally remember reading the OP, thank you for providing an update. I hope that she can get the help she needs and that everyone involved can move on.",
            "I hope things have gone well in these last for months, is it okay to ask for an update?",
            "What the hell, mental health didn't do anything? In my country they would take get into custody for 3 days and do a full assessment",
            "Calling the police on a mental health problem is very dangerous if you are in USA.",
            "Since she is in a recovery program, or was, I can imagine she has had some brain damage via drugs and it has come out in some sort of psychopathy. The problem with people who are delusional psychopaths is that they can be harmless but then one thing will set them off and turn extremely dangerous. That's the difference between sociopaths and psychopaths: One is planned while the other is random based on current mental state.\n\nI would contact her family and inform them of the situation. Think about getting her involuntarily committed so she can get proper diagnosis, medication, and therapy. Also it wouldn't be a bad idea for your friend James and his wife to invest in a security system and a firearm, along with being super extra careful of their surroundings. The wife and baby could only be seen by your friend as an obstacle between her and James.",
