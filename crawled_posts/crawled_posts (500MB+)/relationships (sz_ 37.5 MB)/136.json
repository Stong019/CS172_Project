        "selftext": "Hi everyone.\n\nI logged on this afternoon to find 300 + replies and messages to my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3uj509/my_26f_fiance_28m_slept_with_my_sister_32f/). I am unbelievably touched by the all people who reached out to me, particularly /u/fractalfay's incredible response which spoke to me on a level I didn't think possible from a stranger. I'd like to thank each and every single person who took the time out of their day for me; I was so overwhelmed that I've not responded to a single one as of yet but it is truly truly appreciated.  \n\nNow onto the update.\n\nIt has only been a day or so since I made my post, but it feels like I'd been in that hotel room for weeks, crying in the dark buried under the covers. At some point this morning, I decided to draw the curtains open and let the sunlight in. I went and sat on the balcony and switched my phone on for the first time. It started ringing within 30 seconds. It was my mother, who burst into tears as soon as I answered. Her and my parents had obviously been desperately worried (this is the longest I have ever gone without contact) and had even contemplated calling the police had I failed to contact them by this evening. \n\nMy mom informed me that as I was walking out of Sara's room, down the stairs, and out the front door, Sara was screaming and wailing that she's sorry. Funnily enough, I didn't hear this. I don't know how. I think I was in such a state of shock that I couldn't process anything around me. Honestly, I can't even remember the drive home. After I shut the door behind me, my mom (who was the only other person at home) rushed into Sara's room to find her trashing her room and attempting to slash her wrists with a blunt lino cutter of all instruments (Sara used to do a lot of art). Obviously, this barely caused a scratch but jump started my mom into action. She drove Sara to the hospital, where I understand she underwent some sort of assessment and was kept overnight. She has, incredibly, agreed to undergo treatment for whatever it is that is wrong with her. My mom was surprised she was so complaisant on the drive down, willingly entering the car and saying nothing other than asking where I am. \n\nSara seems resigned and completely deflated; my mom spoke to me at length for the first time in my life about the hardships they had undergone during Sara's childhood. I am unwilling to go into detail and am still in shock about some of the things I heard. Sara is not devoid of responsibility; she has long surpassed the age where she can blame her childhood for her behavior, but my mom admitted through tears that not sending her to therapy at an early age was the biggest regret of her life so far. \n\nI asked my mom if she knew why I had left; she admitted that she had known SINCE SARA'S EX LEFT TWO MONTHS AGO. At this point, I had to struggle not to hang up and I suddenly felt myself going back into that pit, but she begged me to listen. After her ex Harry (I am too drained to invent a name...hi Harry) left, Sara told my mom exactly what had happened. It was not the reason for Harry's departure, although he did know about it. Rather, he had had enough of being Sara's carer, and years of begging her to seek help had fallen on deaf ears one too many times. When Sara informed my mom, my mom told Sara I have to know immediately. Sara refused to tell me, and I still don't know why she changed her mind in that moment. My dad doesn't know for anyone wondering, and thinks I've left as I've also finally had enough of Sara's behavior.\n\nNow here is where the home truths came out. I asked my mom if she knew the details. She was reluctant to tell me anything, stating that it had happened and that was all I needed to know. But I told her I refused to step foot in the house until I knew everything. She then proceeded to tell me that a few months before they slept together, Sara and Jake had kissed at my dad's 60th birthday party. It was a large family gathering with a lot of alcohol involved. I remember Jake getting very drunk with my cousins. Sara had a crying tantrum prior to arriving as her and Harry had an argument and he refused to come (she called me sobbing before she arrived). At some point during the night, Jake asked her if she was okay and hugged her, and once again \"one thing led to another\" and they shared a kiss in the kitchen. Sara told my mom that they were both immediately remorseful and vowed never to speak of it again, but Sara deliberately sought him out the night they slept together knowing he was unlikely to turn her down. She openly admitted she did it to get back at Harry, who had cheated on her during one of their many infamous breaks. I don't think I even entered her thoughts.\n\nAt this point, I'd heard enough. We'd spoken on the phone for over four hours and I felt mentally drained and physically sick. Any hope I had of salvaging my relationship with Jake has completely gone. I feel the last 3 years have been tainted by their betrayal, and the many years before that I wonder: did he like Sara this whole time? Part of me doesn't even want to know.\n\nIt's worth noting he has made absolutely no attempt to contact me other than a single TEXT stating \"I'm sorry. Take as long as you need\". As if it's inevitable I will come back to him.\n\nThings are still up in the air. I don't feel ready to check out of the hotel as I don't know where I'm going to go next. I feel my relationship with my mom has been rocked by these revelations. I don't know what's going to become of Sara. I have no idea what I'm going to do about me and Jake's flat, where I'm going to live. I don't even know if I have a job anymore. I just haven't showed up to work. \n\nBut I know the truth and the smallest part of me is grateful for that. The rest of me is consumed by a pain I never imagined possible.\n\nI guess there's nothing else to do now except wait and see how things unfold. But reading through your comments and messages have been more help than you can imagine, thank you thank you thank you. \n\nAnd for anyone who has have ever experienced symptoms like Sara's, or has been around someone who is so visibly troubled, I beg of you: seek help before it's too late.\n  \n**tl;dr**: I had a four hour conversation with my mom, who not only knew about Sara and Jake, but informed me that they had shared a kiss a few months prior to the event. I am still in the hotel, still heart broken, and have no idea what to do next. The only saving grace is that Sara has agreed to treatment and will not be in my life for the foreseeable future.",

            "I know this is difficult, but hear me on this: One of the best things you can do right now is to stop holing up and get back to normal in the one area of your life this drama fest hasn't touched\u2014your job. Resist the temptation to call in sick or to think that you'll get back to work once this is over with. You may need to stay in the hotel, but for your own health, you've got to not let this spiral out of control to the point where it takes down everything else in your life. It's much easier to pick up the pieces when you have *some* stability, somewhere. Your job is your rock right now. Hang onto it and value it and be appreciative that you do have something else in your life that isn't tied to all this mess. ",

            "I just have no words. What your sister and your fiance did was beyond cruel. \n\n*hugs for OP*",
            "I don't think that I would be able to or even want to forgive *any* of these people, including your mother. I'm so sorry for what you're going through, and wish you the best of luck moving forward. ",
            "Ugh, Ugh, I have no words yet so many. \nFirst off. I hope you dump that asshole immediately. If he really was so sorry he would have fessed up about the Party kiss the moment he found out. And he was going to Marry you?? What the hell was he on. And your mother, I guess Sara is partially to blame but how dare she, you've been walked all over for too long, my dear. \nMove out of your bf's and your family's. Try and piece together your job and if not, then get away. I'd move so far away from them and the family. How does the opposite Coast sound?\n\nYour sister is a monster. Whatever mental issue she has is in no way any excuse for what she's done. Keep her away and if your Gross Fiance can't deny her than he can have her and all the Hellish Tornado involved with it. You deserve so much better. Live a FANTASTIC life and make them all see just how much better you are than them, and if they want you back they can work hard for even a SCRAP of your attention and care.\n\n",
            "I think if there was ever a time to ask your parents for money then leaving and having no contact, now is the time. Your sister is a piece of shit, your mother is a piece of shit, your ex is many piles of shit. You should have zero contact with any of them. Your mother \"protected\" the fragile child which is so spiteful to you. I hope you have zero contact with your family.",
            "OP you are stronger than most people who post here. Remember your family needs to move for you for once. They will try to shift back to what they know but...fuck your horrible sister. ",
            "[deleted]",
            "Wow. Thank you for sharing. I am sure I am not the first, nor will I be the last to say this, but please, do yourself a favor and talk to a therapist yourself.\n\nI grew up with a dysfunctional family, not as extreme but it's fucked with my head tremendously. Your situation is beyond words, and you deserve to have the time and help you need to sort through what you've been through. This situation sounds like the climax of a life of your parents enabling your sister. I can't believe your Mom was going to let you continue a relationship and potentially marry Jake after what he had done. That really stands out to me and kind of completes the picture of your family life as you describe your sister's behavior over the years.\n\nBest of luck to you OP. These may be some dark times but holy shit did you get lucky and find out exactly how shitty things could of been down the road before you were married. ",
            "Thank you for your update. I hope that you feel better- you are a brave women to attempt reconciling all this mess. If I were in your shoes, I would have reached the level of insanity. Best of luck to you and hope everything goes well...\n\nP.S: Ditch that asshole Jake already: he already cross the line multiple times.",
            "Holy. Shit.\n\nWhat mother would cover for a son-in-law's adultery? \n\nThis woman covered for those two and allowed the kissing to be kept silent, robbed you the mere opportunity of having a simple warning to process what was going on, and then trickle-truthed you by disclosing information only when she stood to lose something.\n\nI bet if you hadn't threatened to sever ties with your mother, she would still probably be silent about her knowledge of Sara and Jake kissing each other. How screwed up is that?\n",
            "Text Jake: yes, you are sorry. As for time our wedding will be on the 12th of never.",
            "From one stranger to another, just because these people are family does not make you obligated to them in any way, shape, or form. If you want to forgive, then when you have gathered yourself together you can begin that process on your terms and no one else's. If you want to distance yourself, do that. If you never want to speak to them again, that's fine too. Your choices are your own and no one can tell you that you are wrong, whatever you choose to do. ",
            "Not the same situation but I realized a few years ago how cruel family can be. I briefly dated a guy who ended up sexually taking advantage me which is when I broke it off obviously. I ended up moving in with my sister who's husband had just left her to help pay the bills (and help take care of her daughter). Creepy ex found out from a friend where I was and came around looking for me to \"apologize\" for being a piece of shit. Mid conversation he tells me he's going to hit on my sister. I begged him not to. He did. She dated him for two years and he lived with us for the majority of it. I begged and pleaded with her and confessed the horrible thing he had done to me and she said it was my fault. My family all knew and no one cared, they invited him to all of the family functions. \n\nI learned then how shitty people can  be. It caused irreparable damage with my family. I've become a different person after that. I am far less trusting and much more callous. Honestly, it's something I'm not going to be over for a long time. Just because they are family doesn't mean they are good people. \n\nI would take this as an escape. Go do something for yourself. Travel. Meet new people. Cut contact with your sister. Limit contact with your Mom. ",
            "Wow, OP, I definitely didn't expect an update this soon\n\nI just want to say how proud I, a random internet stranger, am of you. You seem to be thinking logically and doing what you can to deal with your difficult situation, but just one thing, contact your boss and let them know something came up (family emergency, sickness, whatever) and that you might need to take a break. Hopefully he/she will be understanding\n\nI'm not the best with advice nor do I have a way with words to comfort someone, but if you ever want to vent to someone, I can be your ear. I wish you luck OP",
            "Tell your dad about what Sara did and how your mum hid it from you (why? Cause Sara said \" nah I don't want to \" ? Seriously what was her reason for not telling you other than ow I told Sara to tell you but she said no) \n\n\nAs for your POS bf he has shown you how much he cares about you - which is none. Just remember how easy this all was for your sister and she knew he would just sleep with her as soon as she made a move which means jack had feelings for her and she knew about it. I wouldn't be surprised if there was more to this story then they're letting on. \n\n\n",
            ">  She has, incredibly, agreed to undergo treatment for whatever it is that is wrong with her. My mom was surprised she was so complaisant on the drive down, willingly entering the car and saying nothing other than asking where I am. \n\nI'm not. She saw the look on your face. She knows that she's crossed a hard line. I mean, even your parents would hesitant to shelter her if the consequences included zero access to you and your future children. Her only hope is to compliant or, at the very least, appear compliant. Or maybe she's capable of genuine remorse. I don't know. I hope she is. My inner cynic cannot help but muse \"that's a conveniently blunt lino cutter\". \n\nRe. your mum.\n\nI can't even... I mean... Wha...She was gonna let you marry this dude?!\n\nI suppose that Sarah was severely abused by somebody in or close to your family and your parents failed to recognize the warning signs. And I get that denial is a common enough coping mechanism, especially when people feel overwhelmed by shame and guilt, which would go a long way towards explaining why somebody with her history hasn't received the necessary psychiatric care (long term, sustained, in or out patient treatment). That being said... \n\nYour mother might regret enabling Sara in the past, but she's failed to learn a *very* important lesson insofar as she'd allow you remain in ignorance rather than make Sara face the consequences of her actions. I don't know if I'd be able to get past that. Or any of it. \n\nIf you decide to forgive, remember that going no contact is still a perfectly valid option. It's not about punishing them. It's about safeguarding your happiness and well being.  ",
            "I don't know if this is necessarily *good* advice because I know that I myself could not do it were I in your situation  but I honestly feel like you'd be better off washing your hands of these people and starting over. You're 26. You're young and you can have a good life without these people. You have been so betrayed by both your family *and* your fianc\u00e9. Don't go back to him just because it's familiar or because the past few years will have been \"wasted\" otherwise. In fact don't even view those years as a waste. You've learned from this shit. You've learned your worth and what *not* to put up with. If you're in a spot where you can, you should start over entirely. Distance yourself from your mom and sister, cut contact with the worthless fianc\u00e9, get a new place to live. Put this shit behind you, don't allow these people to dictate your happiness or lack of for one more second. You've been wronged by people who are supposed to have your back and you can be stronger because of it. Best of luck to you, lady. You can do it.",
            "Is the original post somewhere?",
            "I would recommend you do what Harry (wisely) did and cut all of those people out of your life - sister, fiance, even mother. Until your parents formally disown your sister or she succeeds in killing herself they're always going to be dragged into her shit. Any contact with her, directly or by proxy, is just going to cause you more problems. ",
            "OP, I am so, so sorry things are turning out this way. Some suggestions:\n\nThis is so cynical, but I wouldn't be surprised if Sara's cutting wasn't an unconscious ploy to make sure that the family's attention remained firmly on her when she knew you'd need their support.  **BUT** you don't have to decide right now what your relationship to your family should be. Text your Mom that you need distance from all of them to process all of this shittiness.  \n\n\nGet in touch with your job. You won't be 100%, but it might help you to get back into a routine that isn't about your family. \n\n\nGet in touch with some friends. You need people to listen to you cry and talk it out who are not at the same time trying to protect themselves and explaiing away their shitty behavior. Most important, you need to know you are valued and not alone.  One of these friends should make arrangements with Jake to be out of the apartment while they can help you get clothes and things you need. \n\n\nStay in the hotel or someplace you can afford for a couple of weeks (Airbnb?). \n\nGiant hugs OP. ",
            "your mother knew that your fiance is a cheating scumbag but she was happy to let you marry him as long as her happy little vision of a family wasn't disturbed.  Protecting you, being loyal to you, being honest to you isn't on her priority list.",
            "You need to care about yourself and about your life. Call work asap, try to work something out. Then think of solutions for your living situation. It's really important now for you to keep the basics (roof, food) in working order, so you will be able to figure out everything else.",
            "The smartest thing you can do for yourself is cut these people from your life. I was one of the people from your prior post that didn't immediately jump on the \"dump Jake\" train but screw that. He wasn't even able to be fully honest with you. What an ass.\n\nI would never let your sister back in your life. She will inevitably hurt you again. She's done so for your entire life. It will happen again. Will you ever trust her again with any future boyfriends? In time you can forgive her as you don't want to live with hate in your heart but you do not (and should not) have to let her back into your life.\n\nYour mother, wow. Maybe later down the road you can repair that relationship but I would distance myself for awhile. I wonder what will happen when Sara comes home. Will your mother still enable her? Only time will tell.\n\nIn the meantime, call up your employer and explain the situation. Get together with some friends so you're not alone 100% of the time. Break the lease if you can take the hit. Or would you be able to stay with a friend for the time being? ",
            "This story has filled me with rage and disgust (obviously nothing compared to what OP is going through). Nobody deserves this level of betrayal... ",
            "Hi OP, I'm glad you decided to give us an update. I'm sorry this seems to be getting progressively worse for you. I suggest you remain at the hotel for as long as you need. That seems like your healthiest option at this point. I'm so disappointed in your mother. She knew this entire time and failed to tell you. I hate how everyone seems to take Sara's side because of her obvious instability. I feel like they spend more time working through Sara's issues than considering your feelings. It was so so wrong of her not to tell you what's been going on. My heart breaks for you. I think you need to take time to gather your strength together and try to move on from this. If that means cutting out your SO, Sister, and Mother then I don't think anyone could blame you. I hope you find comfort in knowing you can still turn your life around and find love and truth in other people who would value your well-being without question. It's possible and will happen for you. These people are awful and don't deserve your forgiveness. ",

There is no more hope of salvaging things with him; he's barely making an attempt.\n\nAs for your family... it's easy for me, as an outsider, to tell you to cut them off, but I know the reality would be much more complicated than that. Whatever you decide to do, I wish the best for you going forward. What happened here is awful, and you have every right to be upset and hurt.",
            "Frankly sounds like your Mom chose you sister over you for your whole life, even when your sister chose herself (by fucking your ex) over you.  When was your Mom ever going to tell you?  Maybe when you got married?  This has been the pattern for your whole life.  Your sister shits on your family and your Mom covers it up.  Even to the point of letting your boyfriend fuck another woman and no telling you.  You would do well to remember that.  UNDERSTAND OP YOUR MOM WILL CHOSE YOUR \"POOR\" SISTER OVER YOU NO MATTER WHAT.   \n\nYour ex-boyfriend is an asshole for sure, but so is your sister and your mom.  You would be best to just keep these people out of your life.  I would also tell your Dad and everyone else in the family what the both did.  They don't deserve to get a pass from the shame they should have.  ",

            "How Sara acted can't even be much of a surprise, given how's she acted throughout your whole life. Screaming loudly about how sorry she is and making a scene is something anyone can do, and something people that are trying to manipulate others do to make themselves the victim and you to forgive them and feel bad for them. It's good she is finally getting help, but it doesn't change what she did or make everything suddenly better, and now, whether she meant for it or not, she will still be the center of everyone's attention and interests, with you and your issues on the back burner again.\n\n\nAs for your mother, what she did was betray you, which can't even be much of a surprise at this point either. Her blowing up your phone the moment it was turned back on was her trying to smooth things over before anyone else had a chance to, so she wasn't blamed for this. She knew and hid it from you, because her other daughter didn't want to talk about it. Telling your sister to tell you and not pursuing it further than that and telling your sister to tell you and warning her if she doesn't, then she will instead are two very different things. One is just thoughtlessness, irresponsible and just plain selfish, she rather be good in the eyes of your sister than you, because you turned out okay, so it doesn't even matter. The other is harsh, but something that had to be done, something a parent would do to keep this from getting this out of control and protect you, and her lack of doing so kind of shows how much she even cares. She wasn't worried about you, she was worried that she might be blamed for this and caught for her role in this, because she'd never know for sure just how much Sara shared with you and how much she was involved.\n\n\nWhat you want do is up to you, but you can believe that if things were different, if you had never found out, your mom would've never told you and would pretend like it never happened(just like Jake), and if you had other issues arise with Jake or broken up with him for something unrelated to this, she'd not only wouldn't have told you then either, she'd probably feel like she was in the clear. She was willing to keep something so important from you, something that would affect you greatly if not now, then in the future(if someone finally told you the truth after you've already both been married, or god forbid, Jake cheated on you again with your sister or someone else after you both were married), because she wanted to spare your sister and do good by her. You've found out what her true priorities and agenda is, and they aren't for you. If she was willing to do this, and to a family member, how can you even trust her to not do something like this again or when something else happens?",
            "This is a pretty heart-rending tale. I'm sorry you have these kind of people in your life OP. I hope you will be a better person for all the painful lessons you've had to endure. Dont' let it get you down. Good people can have bad behaving friends and relations.",
            "What a shitty situation to be in. First, try to salvage your job as that will be one less thing to stress about. I think it's obvious you need to cut ties with Sara and Jake. Sara has needed treatment for years, so until she shows signs of vast improvement, stay away from her. She has been nothing but destructive to everyone who has cared for her the most. You might also want to seek counseling from all of the emotional distress/abuse you've received. As for your mom, you should probably distance yourself from her (and your dad). She has consistently put Sara above you to alleviate her guilt and she was willing to sit back and allow you to marry someone that cheated on you with her other daughter (WTF?!?). \n\nA suggestion if you have the time and money for it...call up a close friend that you feel comfortable sharing these details with and take a small vacation somewhere. You might as well have fun while you plan your next step. You deserve it. I wish you the best!",
            "Why do we have updates to posts where the original post was removed? I'm reading this and would love to give feedback but when I read the comments I have no idea of the relationship between the sister and the fiance.

            "Jesus Christ.\n\nI think I'd probably lose everyone in this story. I mean, some things are...just...that's not something you 'fix'. Your mom is just beyond salvage.\n\nYour sister and (should be) ex are clearly gone. But your mom...yeah, I think I'd have spoken to her for the last time, too.\n\nYour mom simply does not care about you (though she'd say dhe does). That's okay, and it happens. The truck is freeing yourself from her the way that's best for you.",
            "Everyone around you, these people that you thought cared for you, betrayed you. *ALL* of them with the exception of your father, from the sounds of it. They conspired to keep the truth from you under the guise of trying to keep from hurting you.\n\nWhat was really happening, however, is that they were enabling your sister because they don't want to confront the truth. She's mentally ill. She needs a LOT of help.\n\nAnd you need to cut ties with your family.\n\nBest of luck, OP.",
            "Is this even a real story?!  This is insane. I hope you can learn (rather quickly) to cut out your sister and mother from your life.  In the name of recovery, you should obviously break up with your boyfriend as well.

That text - and I've seen many people send it - means \"I understand if you don't want to talk; I'll be here when you do.\"",

            "> As if it's inevitable I will come back to him.\n\nNot really big advice, I'm sure others have you covered there, but communication trumps pop psychology 99/100 times. Yeah he could be arrogantly assuming you're bound to come back to him, or maybe he sees not contacting you as giving you the space you deserve. It's kind of a cliche for the cheater to hound the cheated with apologies. Perhaps it's a combination of the two, or maybe he has an entirely different rationale. Humans are pretty complex.\n\nAnyway, I hope things work out for you. Working out your feelings when you've been cheated on is hard enough, but when the betrayal involves a family member it's twice as bad. If it's any consolation, your finance must have been dreading this for the last few years. If he has a brain he should have realized there was a good chance your dysfunctional sister would eventually spill the secret. It would have been smarter and kinder of him if he just fessed up immediately. ",

Based on the information you have so far, it seems like every relationship could be repaired -- except the one with your now ex-fiance. It would be disturbing if it was a friend, and it's extremely disturbing when it's a sister in obvious, profound mental distress. This makes it seem that the only line between him and cheating is opportunity -- and he took not one, but two of them. He's also taking the approach of distance, perhaps hoping that by allowing for it you'll panic and find some way to blame yourself/forgive him to avoid being alone. He *wants* to be the victim of your sister in the narrative, which to me proves that he isn't. I am very glad that you discovered the sad reality of his character before you got married.

Anger is a very effective motivator, so get angry.\n\nThen, call your boss immediately and tell them that something personal has come up and you haven't been able to call until now. Tell them you'll need a few more days to sort things out, and then see about applying for some kind of emergency or personal leave or whatever it is your work does. Then do that.\n\nThen hop on craigslist or apartments.com and find yourself somewhere to go, and get on that *today*. \n\nNo point in talking it out with Fuckface, trying to get closure or whatever.

            "Sorry OP.\nMy 2 cents though, I wouldn't look too much into how Jake is responding.  A lot of people make it out to be horrible he isn't trying to contact you as much.  I am certainly not advocating his behavior, but you know him better than us.  Truthfully no one really knows how to handle these types of situations, maybe he thinks it better to give you space and wait for you to \"calm down, feel better\" w/e the case.  Basically my point is don't base what you are going to do about Jake on how he is handling this current situation.  You are in a weird state, and a totally F*d up situation no one knows what to do including Jake.   Being in a bed sobbing you are inside your head right now, overthinking.   The real problem is he cheated on you and didnt tell you etc etc.  \n\n\n2nd.

That you were ready to spend your lives together. But he betrayed you in one of the worst ways possible, and even worse, how he handled it after and basically never had any intention of telling you. He kissed her and that was bad enough...after that, he already should have been doing anything he could to make it up to you. But he did worse.\n\nRight now, you need to surround yourself with your friends and people not involved with the situation, and take time away from everyone who played a part in this huge mess. I'm not saying cut your family out forever, but for now, this is what you need to do. It's too close to home...literally. Don't worry too much about whether you'll forgive, or what's going to happen with your relationship to them down the line, just get your own affairs in order. Get a friend who will help you work through all the details and steps for moving on, like finding a new place, while providing you with support.\n\nYou're gonna make it through this. Sometimes shit things happen to good people, but the silver lining is that you know now, rather than finding out down the line (or, you know, never finding out, which almost happened).",

In addition to that she often threatened self harm and the like to get sympathy for her self in other situations. My parent's to this day don't understand why I can't 'just get over' the past (her daughter ended up also being a foster sister so we still see her lots). I try to understand that they care about her as a family member and I love the little girl to death so I make an effort to be civil but am not interested in anything outside of that. I say this just because your mother seems to have done something similar in a way but I hope she also puts effort into your health as well as your sisters.

            "I would like to tell you, as someone who *has* successfully gotten over being cheated on and has a wonderful, loving, honest relationship now; this is simply not a possibility with your fiance. I truly believe that people can get over cheating and move on in their relationships, and even become stronger, but it really only depends on the person's situation. I will try to make this concise, but I want to point out the reasons that a relationship with Jake will not be possible.\n\n* He was with you for 4 years before cheating on you; this means that he was already serious about being with you, and still found it in him to betray you, not once, but twice. Cheating is easier overcome when it happens early on in the relationship.\n* He was not drunk when he had sex with your sister. There was absolutely nothing clouding his judgment except him being turned on by her. There is no excuse for what he did, other than he wanted to.\n* He never told you. He never planned on telling you. He waited until he was caught to let you know the truth and then apologize for it. If a couple is ever going to get over an instance of cheating, the only way it is possible if the cheater comes out with the truth on his or her own, because they felt guilty and remorseful, and no other reason. Any person who has been caught cheating or lying about cheating will only admit to it because they have no other choice. He did not feel guilty, and still does not; not even after 3 years.\n* He has not attempted to contact you, and when he did, he already assumes that you will go back to him. This is a huge red flag already; he thinks he can do no wrong in your eyes, and that he can get away with anything. Whether you *think* you can forgive him or not, this flag means that he thinks he is too good for you. If you continue with this relationship, he will be very, very likely to manipulate and/or emotionally abuse you. This is a bad, bad sign.\n\nAs for your relationship with your sister and mother... Your sister's mental issues are a reason for what she has done, but it is *not* an excuse. I would distance myself from her if I were you, but **stay close enough that you know she's getting treatment**. Whether she successfully goes through treatment or not will determine your relationship with her in the future.\n\nYou need to speak to your mother face to face, not now as you're still very sensitive, but eventually, it needs to happen. You need to find out exactly where you stand in your mother's eyes, because she kept this secret from you in order to protect your sister. There is no other reason she would keep this from you. In all truthfulness, you are the only person who really knows your mother. You're the only person who gets to decide if you think her reasons were good or bad, if she will be able to change, if how she handled the situation was good enough for you, etc.\n\nI hope you find the strength to pull through this. This is a heartbreaking story, and if you post an update again, I hope it's a happier one. Good luck, OP.",

If you had come to her with suspicions, etc., involved her directly, then yes, of course, she should've told you sooner. But I can sort of see where she is coming from here about the kiss. It was just a kiss, they both expressed remorse, and she didn't think it was her place to tell you to end your multi-year relationship over it. When she found out they slept together, she encouraged Sara to tell you, but it honestly was not her business to tell you herself. ",

She screamed as soon as you left her room, and because of you she's willing to seek treatment which her bf of almost 20 yrs didn't do.  She loves you.  Your mom called you within 30 seconds when you turned on the phone, she must be worried sick.  Right now you need family and friends, they love you unconditionally, even they make mistakes they still love you it's not gonna change.  Your fianc\u00e9 is a different story.  Glad you realized he made zero effort to find you instead of making excuses for him.  Do not go back to him.  I don't think he still cares.  Leaving him for yourself, this is not a punishment, is a chance for your better future with the right guy.  You're not alone.  Hugs ",

            "This hit close to home for me. A couple years ago I was going through something traumatic and isolated myself from my family, who lived on the opposite side of the country. I had a trip planned to go home and visit, but I was dreading it. I love my family, but I just didn't want anyone to see me or to be around anyone. Weird thing about depression is it makes you want to avoid people who can help. Anyway, I got to the airport, even made it to my gate, but just watched everyone board. Back then (and still now, sometimes) I didn't want to kill myself but I wished and wished that bad things would happen to me, like getting into a car accident, or a plane crashing. The entire reason I made it to the airport was by telling myself that there was a chance that this was it and it would finally be over. \n\nI walked out of the airport without getting on the plane and called my mom later that I wasn't coming and that was the last time we spoke for several months. In the moment it doesn't seem selfish to act like that, it seems more selfish to exist and suck the life out of everyone around you. I try not to think like that anymore though. ",

Depression can bring somebody down to their knees and sometimes nothing in the whole universe seems to be able to get said person back on their feet. \n\nDepression is not something unnatural or even slightly demonic. It is a shitload of overwhelming feelings that has unintentionally been tucked and stacked away inside a persons subconsciousness over a long period of time. Those feelings try to escape from the subconsciousness into the consciousness but the person isn't ready for those feelings because said person is currently having a lot of guilty feelings, maybe feelings about unrequited love, something work related or somethings else. I don't know if I make sense and I miss something. I will leave it at that.\n\nDepression isn't anyone's fault.\n\nEdit: and this ladies and gentlemen. Could be a tiny reason why depressed people choose to take suicide. Downvotes and a single reply. I doubt that the person that replied is the one that downvoted me. Idioms do not help. Fuck idioms. Few depressed people can openly talk about what they are suffering though as is. Idioms will surely help people. Anyhow. I put down a lot of time, thoughts and feelings for almost everything I comment about. Also, I chose to downvote myself.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone. Sorry I took so long to post but I got very busy, part of which was spent graduating college so I'm glad THAT's finally out of the way. Here is the link for those who need a recap:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4j727c/i_22f_am_getting_married_soon_my_mom_had_an/\n\nWARNING: This is a VERY long update. Also this post is probably going to get flamed. Judging how the comments went down as more time went on the longer my post was up, this is probably going to anger many people. But there were also lots of nice and helpful people too, especially u/RememberKoomValley.\n\nSo I was reading all the comments and the more time went on the more angry and upset I became. People eventually started saying why should parents always have to sacrifice for children, some said I was being a bridezilla and only caring about my day (of course I care! It's my wedding! It's supposed to be a once in a lifetime event that I want to share with everyone!), many people said my dad had depression and my mother's actions were so evil he was forever off the hook for good. Everyone was giving suggestions on how I could meticulously plan the days to rotate everyone and I felt like screaming.\n\nSteve eventually told me to get off of Reddit because he hated seeing me so upset. I couldn't even say exactly WHY I was upset. I just was. Steve said maybe I should go back to my old therapist that I had when my parents got divorced and talk it out with her. To me, this seemed like a great idea. I called her up and asked to have an appointment, despite finals being right around the corner.\n\nSo I went and EVERYTHING came out. How much I hurt still from what Mom did and how we can never be close again. And honestly how ANGRY I am at my father. I never really realized it, but I've gotten so furious and resentful of him. How he never even TRIED to get out of his funk, how dejected he acted if mom somehow came up, how he never said anything DIRECTLY bad about her but subtly made me feel so guilty for loving her. Acting mopey, going from fine to depressed if she somehow came up, how I always feel like I have to walk on eggshells around him and how he gets a free pass because he got cheated on; Something that happens to tons of people every day.\n\nI talked and talked and talked. I made a couple more appointments. I got through finals (I want to shout out to Steve here. He is the only reason I got through it all, passed, and got my degree. He is an incredible human being.)\n\nThe tipping point was my graduation day. Once again, my father made it clear Mom couldn't be sat near him and he couldn't be near her at all. I had to text her when she could come talk to me and had to text him once she left.\n\nHer boyfriend was, of course, not invited. But it was so embarrassing having to contact the officials in charge of the ceremony and ask if my tickets could be changed so my parents could sit far away from each other. They were kind and understanding but that's when I began to get very very angry. My mom has no problem with my dad. She doesn't mind being near him even though she doesn't love him. I began to think how I'm going to have to rearrange ALL my milestones. My marriage, when I have children, my children's christenings and birthday parties...etc.\n\nGraduation was miserable. I couldn't look in any one direction to see my family as I got my degree and walked the stage because they had to be spread out.\n\nI had to make sure my phone was on me and fully charged so I could coordinate my mother and father's locations. It was so awkward mingling with one group and then my mother, knowing both groups were waiting to have their turn.\n\nMy brother interacted with my mother and he was kind of cold but cordial nonetheless. My mother made no complaints, didn't try to argue or force herself in there, and patiently waited for her \"turn\" even though I could tell she was dying to spend more time with me. Pictures had to be rotated. I couldn't have ONE with all my family in there. My father was constantly texting during my time with her asking if she had left yet and if he could come back now.\n\nIt seemed so...CHILDISH. Honestly, the rest of my family could tolerate my mother being around. After all, the divorce was YEARS ago. It's time to start getting over it and moving on with life. It was only because of my DAD that I couldn't relax and just be happy and enjoy my graduation with my family.\n\nI was supposed to go to dinner with my dad, boyfriend and other family after graduation to celebrate. I told them I felt very sick and I needed to go home. I just didn't want to be around anyone anymore.\n\nSteve just held me while I bawled my eyes out. I hadn't cried that hard in years.\nI met with my therapist a couple more times. This is turning into a novel so I will summarize what I came to realize in therapy:\n\nWhile the initial anger and hate I felt for my mom was real, I never stopped loving her. But, I felt like because my dad had been wronged, I had to take \"his side.\" My dad has always made me feel guilty for loving my mother still. While his actions have never been overt, it has been very subtle manipulation. I felt like I had to give my dad cart blanche whatever he wanted because if I didn't I felt like I would lose him too. That he would reject and have nothing to do with me if I didn't practically ostracize my mother. My mother was at one point my best friend and that's gone. I couldn't stand losing BOTH my parents. So dad has gotten whatever he wanted. And I'm realizing that in a subtle way, Dad has been manipulating my brother and I to treat our mother terribly for years to punish her. My dad has always been a super passive aggressive guy. It's nothing new. He's always guilt tripped people and made these little comments that twist people up and hurt them. It's his form of control.\n\nI love both my parents. My mother did a terrible horrible thing but my dad is no saint either. My mom was just more upfront about her awfulness.\n\nMy therapist and Steve also pointed out that if my dad IS truly depressed or emotionally damaged etc. he has never sought to get help for it. Instead he has projected his problems and pain onto everyone else and made it their burden instead of taking responsibility for himself and attempting to go on with life and that is not ok.\n\nI called my mom and asked her over for tea.Steve left to give us privacy. I could list everything we said and talked about but it would make the post longer. Basically my mom never loved my dad and should never have agreed to marry him. My dad knew mom didn't love him but didn't care and insisted she would love him eventually. Some very eye opening things were said that made sense.\n\nMy mother never trash talked my dad (never has) but she gave insights as to why the affair happened. She says she understands it's no excuse for what she did and she is so very sorry for her own selfishness and weakness.\n\nBasically both my parents are human and mistakes were made from both sides. My mom had the affair yes, but it's not like my dad was the perfect man either.\n\nWhile I still will never again be close to my mom perhaps I don't need to be quite as harsh with her as I have been. We will still be low contact but I did decided I DO want her there for the wedding and for the birth of any children I have, etc. I love my mom. Always have and always will. She may not have been a good wife but she WAS an excellent mother and I don't want to cut her out completely. I think my kids lives will be more enriched having her in it.\n\nMy mother started crying when I told her she was invited to the wedding (even though I made it clear to her her boyfriend is not invited. She didn't argue with me on that at all) and said she thought I had asked her to my house to tell her I would NOT be inviting her and she had been prepared to accept that rejection and understand it. I did tell her that if dad was there she was to stay away from him and not try to mend any fences at my wedding. She says she understands completely and will mingle with my grandparents (her parents) and my aunts, uncles and cousins (her siblings and their children). I made it clear to my mother that if she even attempted to talk to dad or any of his family she would be thrown out. She agreed without question.\n\nSteve and I had a final sit down before I called my dad. I asked him to please give me his honest opinion. Steve relented and said while he thought my mother had done the inexcusable, she actually seemed remorseful and willing to accept the consequences of her actions and to move on and that my dad, while a nice guy, came off as way too sensitive and just weak. He said that my dad didn't cheat but he had caused me a lot of pain and anxiety since the divorce and it made him very angry and it was getting hard to like or tolerate my dad and that his family felt the same way, that my dad was actually a master bully in disguise as a super nice guy.\n\nI called my dad and asked to come over and that I needed to talk about something. I sat him down in his living room (so this talk was in his space where he could retreat if he needed to) and said basically\n\"Dad. I love you so so much. You mean the world to me. But after the fiasco of my graduation I've come to realize I have had enough of feeling like I have to pick sides for you and mom. I'm sorry what happened Dad. I really am. But that was 5 years ago. You lost a wife, but I didn't lose a mom. I'm sure you don't mean to, but you've been making me feel like I can't be close with you if I want to have any kind of relationship with mom.If it's still impossible to even be in the room with her dad, then maybe you need to talk to someone so you can start feeling better and not be in so much pain. Is there some kind of abuse that happened that you're not telling me about that makes this impossible?\"\n\nMy dad seemed shocked and then started to get REALLY upset and basically said mom had never hit him or anything but that \"she cheated and broke his heart and that was reason enough to cut her out\"\n\nDad also said I couldn't understand because I hadn't been cheated on, I didn't know what real love was and also implied it was MY fault and my brothers fault because \"if we weren't a part of their relationship he could move on\" but we always remind him of her and what they had, how because of us he can't make a clean break since she's in our lives etc.\n\nI'm sure many redditors will disagree but this is my dad being typically passive. Insinuating that because my brother and I exist he can't get better because we are reminders of mother and it's our fault we exist so he can't cut her out totally. I realize that my dad thinks that if he can get me and my brother to cut my mom out, not only will he succeed in punishing her but he can have us all to himself and not have to share with her and deal with his hurt. He's getting us to do the dirty work for him so he doesn't have to take responsibility.\n\nI told my dad that I loved him and wanted him at the wedding but Mother is invited. Her boyfriend isn't but she is. I told dad that I had talked to her and I promised him she would leave him alone and stay away from him and his family and could he not just put aside differences for a few hours to celebrate with me and Steve on our day?\n\nHe said absolutely not and that I was being unfair and insensitive and that my mom had poisoned me against him. That he wasn't the cheat and she needed to deal with what she had done and not come and by inviting her I was clearly supporting her cheating and that we couldn't be close if that was the case because I was being too much like her.\n\nI had had enough. I stood up and said,\n \"Dad, Steve and I really want you there. You are free to come or not. I love you. But if you don't come, it will absolutely affect our relationship going forward. I am not doing anymore separate celebrations or events. People can either come or stay home for weddings, parties, births and whatever. It's getting ridiculous and I'm sick of being in the middle. The rest is up to you and Mom.\"\n\nThen I left. I haven't heard from my dad since. That's been hard, but I feel like I did the right thing.\n\nI also called my brother and told him everything that happened. My brother was very quiet. He then said while he still hates our mom for what she did and thinks she's a whore that maybe there is more to this than he realized and that he thinks our dad is being a selfish jerk and needs to get over himself. He said it's fine mom is coming to the wedding and that he would be nice to her.\n\nSo that's that. I'm sure many will disagree and be angry with me but Steve and I feel we made the right call. Steve loves and supports me and that's all that matters. I talked to my therapist about it and she said it's possible I was harsh but that maybe my dad needed to hear that since he has been coddled and enabled for five years.\n\nI am fully prepared for my dad to not show up. If he doesn't it's his loss. Thanks again to everyone who gave me input, some of your comments were very eye opening. I may post an update in the future after the wedding but I haven't decided yet.\n\n**TL;DR Broke down and went to therapy. Realized my dad is very passive aggressive and manipulative. My graduation day was horrible but a catalyst to realize things can't continue this way and I'm tired of being in the middle. Had a heart to heart with mom, realized my parents relationship is not a case of saint vs. sinner but two people who are human and made mistakes. Told mom she's invited but boyfriend is not and she will be asked to leave if she approaches my dad or any of his family. Talked to dad and told him he's hurting me with his behavior and it needs to stop. My dad is not speaking to me and there's a good chance he will boycott the wedding. Talked to brother and he supports me and says dad is being unfair. I'm just happy I get to marry Steve and that I don't have to be stuck in bullshit drama anymore.**\n\nEDIT: wow this blew up! Thank you everyone who commented and offered a POV. Except for the people sending PM's of death threats. I've gotten at least half a dozen of those, plus calling me a whore (ironic since I'm a virgin) and hoping Steve cheats. You sound like lovely warm people full of happiness.\n\nI wanted to point out some things that keep coming up:\n\n1. Remember I come from a religion and culture that is very different from most people here. Divorce is shameful for us. It is humiliating. The only justifiable reason for divorce is an affair for our people. Divorce \"because you're not happy\" is not an excusable reason. An affair is the only way out. However, that being said, the person who commits the affair has just crippled themselves. Sex is very holy and pure in our religion and culture. It is to be between husband and wife only. That's it. And if you break up a marriage because of it you are forever blacklisted. While my mother could/should have gotten a divorce without having an affair, she STILL would have had a scarlet letter on her chest for getting divorced for \"no reason\" which is an ultimate act of selfishness. Marriage is very holy in our culture. To divorce for any reason other than an affair is \"to be like an unbelieving sinner\" which is, quite simply, not acceptable. I don't necessarily agree with this as I'm a little more liberal than the rest of my family and most people but it is what it is\n\n2. My mother did NOT get off Scott free. She is no longer welcome in her church and none of her friends associate with her anymore. Her family, her friends, her church, her entire community has shunned her. She also lost her job because dipping your pen in company ink is expressly frowned upon at her former work place. Both she and her lover lost their jobs and had to find new ones\n\n3. Many are saying I need to start including my moms partner in things and saying the fact she has been with him this whole time shows they have something special. It actually does not. I didn't put this in my post but my mom and I actually talked about her boyfriend for the first time. They are on the verge of breaking up and their relationship has been rocky for awhile. \"P\"'s family and friends have disowned him too. He is not of our religion or culture (double bogus for my mom for taking a lover outside the faith) but no one wants anything to do with P. His ex wife has made their lives hell and will not let him see his kids. When he does see them they treat my mother terribly and make their hatred known. P is also sick of being not invited to every family event on our side and says Mom needs to start demanding he be invited to things. Mom is of the view point that they brought misery on themselves and need to accept the consequences of their actions and furthermore knows that if she insisted on bringing P she would burn the last of the bridges she has with us and will not do that. P is sick of her \"not putting him first\" and their relationship is falling apart because of it. The only reason they have lasted this long is because my mom and P only have each other because no one else wants them. And they both know it. My mom actually does love her boyfriend but he does not love her anymore and she knows they aren't going to make it\n\n4. Many are saying (even explicitly hoping) Steve cheats on me so I understand my dads pain because I clearly don't since I haven't been cheated on (hey that's what my dad said!). This experience has actually taught me the opposite. If Steve were to cheat I would be out of my mind with pain and hurt. I wouldn't be able to function. I don't blame my dad for being unable to be around my mother. At first. If I had children with Steve, as much as it would SUCK, I would put on my big girl pants and do what needed to be done for my kids. I've gotten plenty of comments and PM's from people who WERE cheated on and heartbroken and devastated...and they did what needed to be done. Since I now know what it's like to have parents that pick their pain over their kids I know I would NEVER want to put my kids through that. It's just basic human decency.\n\n5. I am not on any parents side. I don't love either of my parents more nor do I think either should be demonized and bashed or out on a pedestal and coddled.My parents are human and imperfect. They are both great people. And they both have done some really shitty things. That's it and that's all",

            "After all this drama I think it's important for you to take some time to just reconnect with the idea of your wedding and the celebration it is of moving forward in your relationship with your (obviously wonderful) fiance. Everything you've had to deal with with your parents is like adding sulfur to soup- every bite has that lingering flavor. \n\nYou were a mature adult. You drew healthy boundaries. You really looked deeply into how you feel and expressed that to the people in your life.\n\nNow make a date with some girlfriends and go sit in the park tying little scraps of ribbon around bags and talk about makeup for the big day, or whatever is more you. Just find a way to *enjoy* it. Have fun with it. Build some positive emotional associations so when you think about your wedding this isn't the first thing that pops into your head.",
            "Your brother is modeling the behavior your dad should have: he has serious issues with your mother's behavior, they are currently estranged, but he acknowledges that most people are flawed humans rather than mustache-twirling villains. And most importantly, he is prioritizing celebrating your wedding over grinding his personal ax.\n\nI feel for your dad--it sounds like there were a lot of serious issues in the past and that he is suffering. But at a certain point he has to take charge of that; he needs to seek therapy or accept the consequences of his behavior. \n\nIt would have been awesome if your update contained a magical strategy for making divorced people suddenly reunite for a Christmas miracle, but I think you did the best you could given the circumstances.\n\nThe only thing I would add is that you could recruit your brother to suggest therapy for your dad--not because his feelings are wrong, but because he seems so hurt even 5 years down the line.",
            "OP, you are positively amazing. You did some really hard emotional work (in the midst of trying to graduate and get married). Your Dad acts like he was the only injured party. You and your brother were injured as well. He did nothing to take care of you and everything to make his children \"take care of/indulge\" him.\n\nI have a couple of friends who went through very bitter divorces where the spouse not only cheated, but also tried to screw the kids over regarding child support and other needs.  They never once made the children feel that seeing the other parent was an act of betrayal, but called friends/therapists/pastors and bitched about the EX privately.\n\nYour mother and father each took a selfish path, but your mother seems to recognize her selfishness, where your father's seems never-ending.\n\nI hope he gets some help learning to have a separate relationship with you.",
            "You did the right thing.  I'm glad your brother is willing to be polite to her at the wedding.  That shows a lot of class and maturity on his part to be willing to be nice to her in honor of your big day.  \n\nYour dad is behaving like a toddler.  (but you already know this)  Don't give into his tantrums.  Don't negotiate with emotional terrorists.\n\n",
            "Look!  You have the right to ask anybody you want to your wedding. Your mother and father have the right to come or not. That's just the straight fact of the matter. Don't dwell on what you can't change. It is their decision. Happy marriage to you!  ",
            "Good for you, at some point you have to prioritise your own feelings. What your mom has done is inexcusable, but she sounds like she's  trying her best to make amends (even going as far as to willingly walk into what she thinks is a rejection scenario). \n\nYour dad is still wallowing in pity and self-loathing. He wants others to feel his pain because he has never actually addressed it. He needs therapy, and it may be a good idea you make this a condition of future relations if you bring children into this family. I can't imagine what sort of spite he could pass on to young and influential children, after hearing how your brother speaks of your mother (calling her a whore). ",
            "I am so mad at your dad and I'm glad you're not capitulating to him anymore. \n\nI think you should have MORE contact with your mom and much lower contact with your dad. Frankly, your mom's affair was between her and your dad, and she has acted completely appropriately in the aftermath. Your dad did not. He poisoned the well to get back at your mom, and that's gross. It's within his rights to end the marriage, but it's NOT within his rights to effectively hold your relationship with your mother hostage.  He has admitted to punishing YOU for her actions. He taught you and your brother to think that your mother is a whore. That is sick and wrong. \n\nYour mom made a mistake, but she's a human, and she didn't let it affect how she treated you, which is how a mature adult handles parenting. Your dad has not done that. Stop punishing your mom. Start expecting your dad to behave like a fucking adult.\n\nSteve seems really solid and supportive. Best of luck with your marriage.",
            "> People eventually started saying why should parents always have to sacrifice for children, some said I was being a bridezilla and only caring about my day (of course I care! It's my wedding! It's supposed to be a once in a lifetime event that I want to share with everyone!), many people said my dad had depression and my mother's actions were so evil he was forever off the hook for good. Everyone was giving suggestions on how I could meticulously plan the days to rotate everyone and I felt like screaming.\n\nFuck those people. Your wedding is about you, no one should be miserable on their wedding day.\n\n\nI think you did the right thing, your dad needs to grow up.",
            "Wow, the comments on the OP were crazytown.  This sub sucks.",
            "Hey OP, don't worry too much about what reddit things. There are a few hot-button issues here and cheating happens to be one of them. Lots of redditors *vehemently hate* cheaters and that's why you got the kinds of comments you did. But personally, I think you're right. Your mom cheated and that makes her a bad wife. It doesn't have nearly as much to do with her as a parent or your relationship with her. The things that your dad did? I get it, but that's exactly what you're not supposed to do as a divorced parent. He refrained from trash talking her, but still put himself first and put you and your brother in the middle. That's shitty parenting, even if it's forgivable at first. After 5 years? You're right that it's ridiculous. \n\nI think you approached this just right--you did a lot of soul searching, you did a lot of thinking about the future, you gave your dad a choice and tried to encourage him to get help for his issues. What he does now isn't on you. I'm sorry it turned out this way, but I don't think you could have spent the rest of your life dividing up events (not just holidays and your birthday, but your kids' birthdays and school plays and everything else). It's just not feasible and, at some point, your dad is going to have to figure that out and deal with his own feelings. Maybe this will be the kick in the butt he needed and, after he spends some time being pissed off, he'll start moving on.",
            "I'm so happy to read this update.  You are handling this incredibly well, and I think getting back into therapy to figure out what you wanted to do was incredibly smart and really paid off.\n\nYour mother's decision to cheat was a bad one, and you very legitimately felt hurt and betrayed by it both personally and on behalf of your dad.  But one bad action does not define a person, and it sounds like since that time she has done everything she can to be a good parent and to put you and your brother first.  She has respected whatever boundaries you've drawn, she hasn't tried to guilt you or make you pick sides, and whenever you have let her in she's been supportive and loving.\n\nYour dad is a whole other story.  Just like one bad action doesn't define a whole person, one instance of being the wronged party does not give you a free pass for your own actions forever.  I'm sure your dad was very hurt by being cheated on, but since then he has repeatedly chosen to behave badly himself.  He has guilt tripped you and forced you to choose sides and thrown tantrums.  \n\nGood parents don't constantly privilege their own feelings ahead of their kids' feelings.  But on every big occasion in your life your dad has focused solely on himself and demanded you conform to his wishes, without regard to how you felt.  Your mom hurt him, but instead of finding ways to move past that he's been *hurting you*.  That is a really stark contrast with how your mom has always put your wishes first on those days even though I'm sure it was very painful for her to have to miss things or be segregated and get limited time with you.\n\nSo well done refusing to shoulder the burden of your dad's pain or let him use it like a weapon on you anymore, and I'm so glad you've reconnected with your mom and are planning to have her in your life more going forward.  Part of becoming an adult is renegotiating your relationships with your parents and how you view them, and you're doing a great job of navigating that in a particularly difficult situation.",
            "Hi, OP.   \n\nI had something similar happen when I got married oh-so-many-years ago, although it was my dad I was hugely angry at for \"leaving me\" and my mom who ended up having the mental problems.  \n\nI came to the same conclusion that you have come to, that no one was blameless and no one was the devil. My dad was always ok either way, and I invited him. My mom was local to me, and got drunk, and told me that if my father or one of my sisters (\"daddy's girl\" historically) was anywhere near our state, she wouldn't come. Oh and also she didn't like my older sister either.  \n\nI had been properly primed by therapy to say, \"I'm sorry to hear that, but they are invited and you're still invited and I'd still like you to come.\"\n\n(Then I went for a walk with my fiance and cried my eyes out and asked him if he was still going to marry me and he said he isn't marrying my mom, he's marrying me and of course. He also apologized for having told me to stop calling my mom \"crazy.\")\n\nAnyway, this went down a few months before my wedding. On the day, my dad came, and said sister came, and believe it or not, my mom came. And she was sober and she behaved herself. \n\nI even have in my possession the most miraculous photo of all time: the photographer, who I'd apparently failed to brief properly, told everyone in my family to come for a photo and he posed my sisters on one side of my groom and me, and my mother and my father *standing next to one another* on the other side.  Neither one was willing to contradict the almighty photographer.\nI believe that is the only photograph that exists of them anywhere near each other before my mother died 13 years later.  (I can't say \"in the same room\" because we got married in a park, hence outside).\n\nMay it be so for you. Hold strong to your line to each, \"I have invited both of you. I would like you to come, but of course, that is your choice and I have no control over what you choose.\"   \n\nYour dad has some time to get used to this \"get used to it dad, she exists and I have a relationship with her and I'm no longer going to be used to punish her\".   Maybe he'll grow up. No one was more astonished than I was when my mom behaved. Maybe he will too. Maybe he won't, and that needn't put a pall on your wedding. You invited him, you told him \"n\" times he was welcome, he chose to not come. Or possibly, he chose to come. You're celebrating with all those who wish you well enough to put aside their differences, and that's who you need around you at that point.\n\nGood luck.\n\n*Edit: Himself to herself\n",
            "Wowwwwww. OP, I am so impressed by this post. I think it's really rare on /r/relationships to see the level of self-work and awareness that you showed here. It's not an easy thing that you did, but it was absolutely the mature and adult thing to do. I just wish that your dad had been able to match your choice.\n\nI know that this is a hard situation, and I'm really sorry you have to go through it. I hope that your dad comes around for the wedding and works on himself. Congratulations to you and Steve!",
            "I missed your original post, but I'm so sorry your Dad is putting you in that situation.\n\nWhen my sister got married, her FIL had cheated and left her MIL only a year before their wedding, and he immediately married his \"other woman,\" to boot.  Tensions were VERY high, and planning the seating arrangements was like planning a battle campaign, since we had to make sure entire factions of my now ex-BIL's family weren't sitting close and we had a buffer zone of friends in between the factions.\n\nYet my BIL told his parents: \"I know you guys hate each other right now, but I expect you to be civil and to encourage others to also be civil on your behalf.  You will have to be in a few family pictures together, but it will be very quick and you do not have to stand next to each other.  Suck it up.\"  And they did.  (And at my nephew's recent wedding, my sister - whose emotional affair was one of the reasons their marriage fell apart - and ex-BIL are also quite nice to each other.  I mean, they're not falling into each other's arms, but they were good for pictures and ceremony things and their new partners were chatting nicely.  They even went to high school graduations where things were more tense with good grace. You can be an adult about these things.)\n\nThat your Dad is that manipulative and obstinate and controlling, it's kind of obvious why your Mom may have cheated on him and left him.  She sounds like she's handling it with as much grace and personal culpability as humanly possible, whereas your Dad is not. (Seriously, your brother still refers to your Mom as a whore?  He did not learn that phraseology in a vacuum.)\n\nYou did the difficult but correct thing.  Your Dad needs to move on and learn how to be civil.  It is possible.",
            "It's not on you.  Invite those who you want to attend your wedding.  They are adults who can decide for themselves if they attend.  As soon as you start adjusting *your* behavior per the request of others, then you become an extension of their will.  You become a participator in their drama.  \n\nYou are only responsible for you.  If your dad can not come because he hasn't forgiven your mom, that is a choice he needs to make for himself and that you should respect.  If you accommodate him than you are an equal participant in that conflict and no longer rebuilding.  \n\nI would tell my dad that I understand and that I am really sorry and I wished he would be there, but will not resent him for dealing with matters the way he thinks is best for himself.  \n\nIf your goal is to repair relationships and move forward healthfully with all parties, than everything you say or do should reflect that.  If your father presses the issue or asks, be honest.  Let him know clearly and confidently that you are working on forgiving your mother and repairing your relationship with her.  You don't have to require him to do the same, but he needs to respect whatever decision you make for yourself.  \n\nCongratulations on the wedding!  Good luck with your future!  \n\nI know that family is a major factor in life, but remember that you are the author of your narrative and that you are awesome.  Have an awesome wedding and be awesome with your husband!  There is always rain, but never give up your moments for anyone else.  *You* are important and your happiness should be paramount to *you*.

            "Surprise Surprise! The kids find out that parents' breakup wasn't completely one-sided. This is exactly why I don't think kids should ever get caught up in the relationship of their parents. One can be a terrible husband/wife but an amazing parent. I hope your brother can one day have a real relationship with his mother like any kid deserves. I suspect he was young enough to just follow your and your dad's lead on how to treat mom",
            ">Dad also said I couldn't understand because I hadn't been cheated on\n\nBut apparently he still expects you to act personally wronged by what your mother did to *him*. He needs to listen to his own words here.\n\nI hope your dad grows up and realizes that you deserve to have a mother, regardless of what his relationship with her is.",
            "You and your brother are way, WAY too harsh on your mother. You're *still* low contact even though you love her, she loves you, and you're beginning to understand how unhappy she was in her marriage and what a jerk your father is?\n\nLike... honestly, it sounds like having more of her in your life would make you much happier than having more of your father in your life. She sounds like a wonderful parent, whereas he sounds like a passive aggressive bully, frankly, and he certainly doesn't care about your comfort and happiness as much as your mother does. The way she's acting vs the way he's acting right now is very telling. She's acting like a mature adult who doesn't want to cause you any more hurt, whereas he... is self-absorbed and not being considerate of your feelings *at all*.",
            "Your mom cheated. She's not the first mom to cheat, and she won't be the last. Your dad has every right to be hurt but he chose to bring you into this world, and he doesn't get to make these kinds of rules for your celebrations.\n\nYou did the right thing... and yes, your dad needs to come to a place where he can be in the same room with a person. Doesn't have to interact, just needs to be there for you. It's not about him or her... it's about doing something for his daughter.\n\nFathers make these choices all the time, and many won't hesitate to put themselves in places they wouldn't dream of for the sole benefit of having a smile on their child's face.\n\nYou made the right choice.",
            "First of all (with regard to TLDR) you didn't \"break down\" and do anything. You came to some seriously grown up realizations about some seriously tough stuff and you asked for some help. So Bravo to that!\n\nI think its a really, really big deal that you've realized that your parents marriage is just that. THEIR marriage. Has anyone ever thrown the term \"enmeshed family\" your way? I come from one and its basically a therapy way of saying everybody is all up in everybody else's business all the damn time. There's usually a lot of manipulation from one or two members that's more or less designed to keep it that way. Lots of in fighting and \"sides\" and everyone has to be involved in every decision even when its not at all appropriate. Its not YOUR choice or decision its the FAMILIES.\n\nIt sounds to me like, intentionally or not, your parents (more so your dad from the way you're describing things) made a concerted effort to kind of force you and your brother to be part of their marriage. In a weird way its like you were all married to your mom. She didn't betray HIM she betrayed ALL of you. Even though she really didn't. Yeah cheating is the worst but it sounds like she's always adored you and longed to be part of your life AND she's had the self awareness to step back and recognize what she did and not force herself on you or really even defend herself.\n\nI'm not trying to exonerate her, cheating is really terrible, but it sounds like you've already learned that there's almost always more to the story. If your dad can manipulate you the way he clearly has chances are (and your mother more or less confirmed this) he did it to her. But that doesn't make him a bad person or someone you have to cut out. It just makes him a person with bad communication skills and worse coping ones.\n\nVery long story short my advice would be try to get away from the final statements. Just looking at the 18 day passage of time from your last post you're already at a better spot with your mom then you were and there's no reason to limit yourself and say you'll \"never\" be close again. Its okay to give yourself permission to forgive your mom and work toward having that closeness again.\n\nIts also okay to understand that your dad has issues he needs to work on. He's the one who has to live with his choices. He's the one making the decision to go or not to go. That is not on you. He's responsible for himself. \n\nThat's like the hardest thing for people in enmeshed families to realize, that they really aren't responsible for or to anyone but themselves.\n\nSo I say plan the wedding you and the very excellent sounding Steve want. You've made your decision about the invites so now you get to forget about it and move on. Your day is going to be terrific regardless because at the end of it you'll be married to a great guy and starting a really amazing part of your life.\n\nYou sound like someone who isn't afraid to confront tough situations or rethink first impressions and that is going to help you get really far in life and its a great way to go into a marriage. \n\nI wish you guys the absolute best.\n\n",
            "When I was two my mother hit my father with a frying pan... just hard enough to knock some sense into him.\nLike your mother he too was not a faithful person to his partner.\nMy parents divorced and my father 36 years later is still married to the woman with which he had his affair.\n\nMy mother is a great woman, she held her head up high and made all of her choices based on what was best for me. I had a great childhood with my father, and his \"new\" wife became a very important part of my life. I don't know that any of that would have been possible if my mother behaved like your father.\n\n\nWhat your mother did is inexcusable. There are ways around a loveless marriage without infidelity. She risked her marriage, her friendships, and her relationship with her children for what; her time of fun?\n\nThat isn't what good parents do no matter how loving and caring they are to their children.\n\nYour dad is very hurt, so much so that similarly his actions are in the very same way risking his relationships. This isn't the behavior of a healthy man making good life choices.\n\nIt appears as though you have done the right thing, you have bent and accommodated for too long now it is you time.\n\n",
            "I had to go through something similar with my father having an affair and leaving my mom.  Though I went the opposite direction.  I loved my father, but I wasn't about to put my mother through that stress. I felt that when I had a parent involved in an affair, they not only ceased caring about my other parent, but ceased caring about the stability of my life.  Last thing I was going to do was punish my mom further mentally.  \n\nI gave my father a video tape of the wedding. I didn't regret it then and over a decade later I don't regret it now.  After experiencing being cheated on myself, I know without a shadow of a doubt I made the right decision excluding him from that day.  The mental games that makes a person play is unimaginable.  \n\nThat being said I hope it works out for the OP. Children in this situation are the innocent parties and always deserve to be treated respectfully by both parents. \n",

Life is much better, Dad finally pulled through. Message me if you need some help!",
            "My grandfather cheated and my grandparents divorced.  I don\u2019t think they were a good match or had a good marriage.  It was very volatile. My grandmother went full on vindictive (cutting family pictures in half, etc) and manipulated my father into not inviting his father (my grandfather) to his own wedding.  My father regretted that until the day he died.  He wished that both his parents had been there.\n\nThese things are often not clear cut good-versus-bad.  They were not able to be civil and in the same room for another 15 years.\n\nThis day is about you.  If you have a relationship with both parents they should both be there.  They don\u2019t have to socialize with each other, but it\u2019s wrong for them to force you to pick sides.  \n",
            "Reading your original OP, I immediately zeroed onto your dad's actions.  Something about him just didn't add up.\n\nWhile your mom broke the family's trust with her cheating, from your description, all of her subsequent actions demonstrated integrity.   That's hard to shake.\n\nYou just need to treat both of your parents as adults with flaws and enforce your own personal boundaries.  ",

He needs to learn that if he is going to take this stance then he is going to miss out on certain life events. \n\nWhile I know where he is coming from, and I would probably do the same, you don't have to accommodate for him, it is ultimately his choice.

It sounds like he needs therapy.\n\n>That he wasn't the cheat and she needed to deal with what she had done and not come\n\nNope. She cheated on him, not on you. She's your mother.

            "I am 200% in agreement with everything you did and said here. Honestly? I've seen this EXACT dynamic before (woman leaves marriage, man acts wounded and innocent and wronged, forces kids to choose teams for 20 years after divorce), and your dad is ABSOLUTELY milking it for all it's worth. I'm amazed you didn't get fed up sooner.",
            "Bloody hell your dad's an idiot.  \n  \nMy parents divorced under similar circumstances. Dad had an affair. He decided to divorce. He kept seeing his sidechick... and mum moved on.  \n  \nBOTH my parents walked me down the aisle. My wedding photos have both my parents, my now-stepdad and dad's now-ex in them (his now-wife was there as well), as well as my husband's parents and step-parents.  \n  \nHow can people be SO FUCKING PETTY that they can't set their shit aside for their kids for ONE DAY?!",
            "After reading your two posts, I'm sitting here in shock. I have exactly the same situation with my parents; they divorced eight years ago due  (in part) to my mum's affair , and for years afterwards my dad was acting exactly the same way as your dad. \n\n\nFor a long time I fed into my dad's selfishness and totally demonised my mum, because she was the one who cheated. I swore I would never Talog to her again and I would certainly never meet her new partner. \n\n\nAnd then I grew up. I realised that nothing in life is ever that black and white. There was no good parent or bad parent, there were just two people trying their hardest in a bad marriage that eventually collapsed because they just weren't right for each other. My mum cheated because after 20 years of being married to someone who was mentally checked out,  she was lonely and frustrated. It was the wrong thing to do, but she's only human. Please give your mum a chance to be your mum again. I think it's likely that she acted out of desperation, and it sounds like she is genuinely sorry for the effect her actions had on you and your brother. \n\n\nAnd also, I think it might be good for you to give her partner a chance too. Before I met my mum's partner I had this horrible idea of what sort of person he was (because in my mind he'd broken up a marriage), but now I call him my stepdad. He also had legitimate reasons for being in that situation. \n\n\n\nI'm not saying you should invite the guy to your wedding or start calling him \"stepdad\". But I think if you just take it in baby steps, getting to know the guy could help you to resolve a lot of the issues with your mum. \n\n\n\nAfter all the years of family drama that I've had, I've finally realised that it's better to aim to love people, rather than striving to hate them. It's a lot less stressful that way. ",
            "It can be very painful coming to terms with parents as flawed people in their own right. It sounds like your mum is honestly respecting your boundaries and letting you set the pace for your relationship. She has owned her mistakes and is happy to be a part of your life in any way you see fit. \n\nI do have sympathy for your father, I'm sure he must have been heartbroken. However I think you're absolutely right to say he wants to punish your mother indirectly through you, and he doesn't seem to care much about how that has affected you. Your father doesn't seem to respect your feelings and I hope he gets his head out of his arse and realises your wedding day is about you and your husband, and isn't just a special edition pity party for him. I hope he does get help, he seems to have lost his identity as a husband and replaced it with one as 'the wronged man' instead of making a new life for himself.\n\nLive your life. Enjoy your wedding. If his love for you exceeds his hate for your mother he'll come round. If not, that speaks volumes.",

It's taken a long time to get over that pain. \n\nBut at no point in the last five years since the relationship ended have I ever once put any of that on my children. I have spent quite a few events with my ex-wife. Sometimes, just the two of us to enjoy watching our children's events, be they sports or plays or recitals or whatever. \n\nLook, your mother made a mistake. A big one. Your father, however, has been putting this on you and your brother. Your father is absolutely wrong. I'm glad you're seeing that now. \n\nHave a relationship with your mother. She won't be around forever, and you will absolutely regret it if you don't. From what you've said is that she was a great mom, and has been absolutely perfect in handling the situation since.

My ex was a dreadful husband but he's not an awful father ( okay, he could be a better father for sure but at least he's not horrible.). \n\nAs a wronged spouse I'd say seeing him is good for me.

            "Good for you OP. I think there's something to be said and learned about the diverging paths of your parents. \n\nYour mom screwed up by cheating on your dad, but she's owning up to her decision. She stuck with  her feelings, divorced your dad, and made the best of her newfound relationship. There were plenty of consequences that she had to deal with, but she eventually learned how to be somebody worthy of your time despite her past transgressions. Now she's somebody who can both be able to connect with you and be in a relationship that makes her happy (or at least happier). It's pretty clear that learning process wasn't easy or painless, but she stuck with it.\n\nYour dad let his sadness consume him. He never went to get help, and chances are he's stuck in a negative spiral where he's completely demonized your mother in his mind in order to numb his own pain. I know in your original post you were so visibly frustrated by your dad not \"getting over it\", but I don't think you fully realize how much he's just so far gone from a healthy state of mind. For you, it's easy to think about how much time has passed and how people should think about healing after that many years of hurt. However, I think your dad is so caught up about his pain that he's never learned to let it heal. For him, every interaction with your mother is picking at scabs and re-opening the wound, and at this point, he just can't even comprehend that the best course of action is to leave the damn thing alone. And it's gotten to the point where it's changed him for the worse.\n\nI hope that your dad gets the help he needs. Maybe he'll never forgive your mom, and you're right to recognize that this in itself is okay. However, he definitely needs to clean up his act in the way he treats you and other people, and you should keep holding him to that.",
            "Your dad is by no means a saint. And this:\n\n> He said absolutely not and that I was being unfair and insensitive and that my mom had poisoned me against him. That he wasn't the cheat and she needed to deal with what she had done and not come and by inviting her I was clearly supporting her cheating and that we couldn't be close if that was the case because I was being too much like her.\n\nis wrong in so many ways. However:\n\n> My mom has no problem with my dad. She doesn't mind being near him even though she doesn't love him.\n\nWell *of course* she has no problems with him. What did he ever do to her?\n\n> My mom was just more upfront about her awfulness.\n\nWhat a lovely way to put it. She would still be at it hadn't she been found, you know?\n\n> she actually seemed remorseful and willing to accept the consequences of her actions and to move on\n\nWell *of course* she is willing to move on. She was **not** wronged, what is she moving on from?",
            "Getting late to the party. Your father should suck it up and be there for you, regardless.\n\nHowever, for all those piling up on him and telling that you're mother is only \"human\". Betrayal is often compared with domestic abuse. Can you imagine someone saying that \"oh, your father was frustrated in an unhappy marriage, so he hit your mother.\" I guess mistakes happen because he's human, right? No way!\n\nUnhappy marriages happen, and a normal mistake is to try to stay longer than you should, or saying things that you regret, or getting your kids involved in an argument. Having an affair is abusive behavior and in no way excusable because you're a human being.",
            "Your dad is clearly traumatized and needs help. The way you broke it to him was not the best way but it had to be done. I doubt he will show. And you should not let it affect your day. At the same time you cant just ambush someone after not saying anything for years. Of course he was going to react that way. I don't blame him either. He is traumatized, he cannot see beyond what happened to him in relation to anything that has to do with your mother. And he has let it ruminate for years. He is not going to get over it over night either, but at least this was like a rock bottom thing, or perhaps something that starts the process to where he can finally see other possibilities. At the end of the day though, you ask me I wouldn't have invited my mother. The reason being my dad who stood by me when the going got tough clearly has issues and would absolutely break if I brought my shitty mom to the wedding. And after all hes done for me the least I could do is respect that about him. My mother clearly made her bed when she decided to wreck my family, you don't owe your mother a damn thing. Even if she turned out to be a saint. At the same time whether he shows or not do not let it affect your day and understand the reason, even if it seems selfish it is not a normal circumstance, it is a devastating highly traumatic and in his case unresolved and untreated tragedy. So cut him a break and instead try to help him to move forward. Just say \"Dad I am your daughter and I have always stood by you, please just do this for me. Go to a therapist.\"",

He would be wrong as I think you made the right choice. Although you could have added something like \"I will try to make sure that you guys are seated apart, but there is always a possibility that you might be close to her during the reception at some point\".  \nNot everyone gets over something like infidelity and lies specially when it comes from a spouse of many years with whom you have built a life and have kids. It is as life changing an event as there is since it flips upside down your trust in people since the one person that you trusted betrayed you.  Your dad is shattered and might never be the same, and it is fine to try to help him overcome it.

It's been 5 years, and you punished her for hurting you, rightfully so, but it sounds like nobody has really said that it's okay to forgive someone who is so important to you that has faced their mistakes directly.\n\nSounds like mom doesn't need the Scarlet letter burned into her, from what I read in your post.",

As a child of divorced very newly parents, I am so blessed that my parents are willing to put their differences aside for me and my siblings. I wish you and Steve the best, but it sounds like even if it doesn't work out you're a loving enough person that you realize your kids come before your relationship issues, because at the end of the day, you TWO create them, it's not one person's fault, ESPECIALLY the kids.

            "Just to be the devil's advocate here, can we really blame the husband for feeling bitter? \n\nHis marriage was clearly one where he loved the mother more than she loved him. Although the mom said that she had told him about her misgivings with their marriage before getting married, is it not possible that he understood her concerns as pre-wedding jitters rather than \"I don't love you. At all.\"? As well, if most people heard that their future spouse was not 100% about the marriage, they'd probably opt out. The fact that he tried to push for it regardless makes it seem like he really loved her, enough to be okay with her insecurities about the marriage because he was secure in their future. Together.\n\nIronically enough, being married to her probably made him into the insecure man he is today. Being with someone who doesn't want to be with you takes a toll on a person. They don't express any sort of desire for you. They don't make you feel wanted. They don't make you feel needed. A person's self esteem can suffer. And now, it looks like he's acting out because he's scared to lose his kids to her. \n\nI don't think his behaviour is all that surprising. I can empathize with OP that it must be frustrating, but instead of giving him an ultimatum, why don't you help him through this. Why don't you get him to go to therapy? This is obviously a bigger issue to deal with beyond your wedding. ",

Really, isn't that great?  Could it be because she is the cheater and lives with her cheating partner.\n\nI wonder if people even read the first post from OP.  Dad certainly was not a villain in that one, nor is he in this one.\n\nLook I'm not saying Mom should be beaten in public nor do I think she shouldn't attend.  But absolutely I hate the fact that this sub is just giving into a hive mind of bashing the Father who obviously is suffering.  ",

Absolutely, but at the end of the day she's human and sometimes people just do shitty things.\n\n\n*Dad also said I couldn't understand because I hadn't been cheated on, I didn't know what real love was and also implied it was MY fault and my brothers fault because \"if we weren't a part of their relationship he could move on\" but we always remind him of her and what they had, how because of us he can't make a clean break since she's in our lives etc.*\n\nYour dad might not be a cheater but he's childish and manipulative. I sympathize with the fact he was cheated on, but he can't keep guilt tripping everyone. He needs to take that big step and get help for himself.

What hes feeling and going through ?\n\n\n No one would ever suggest to a victim to meet up with his abuser. Just because there was no physical abuse does not mean what your father went through wasn't just as damaging for him. \n\n\nEveryone is going on about their experience with cheating. EVERYONE reacts DIFFERENTLY to different things. Just because you can move on does not mean hes able to. Some people can move on from abuse too but others can't. We can't put expectations on people based on our norms. You can't determine how someone should feel after such an event. \n\n\nFurthermore the mother is being praised and Im still not sure I understand why. So what shes accepting of everything ? She wasn't the one who was hurt in this process. Its like saying ow your abuser is okay seeing you so why can't you be okay being civil with them. It just not comparable considering he is the one who is hurt so much through it. This guy couldn't move on with his life for 5 years, he is still deeply hurt, where as the **mother is happy forming a new life with her affair partner.**  \n\n\n\nAnd the claim the **mother didnt love the father so he deserves to be cheated on** ? freaking hell. **Why the hell did the SHE marry someone who she didn't love ? why did she have kids and have a family with this guy ? why not walk away ? what was stopping her ?** how is this purely the fathers responsibility ? **Did she ever discuss  her desire to leave ? No* she didn't want to until she secured some other guy to be with. Theres more to the mother than shes letting on but its really not hard to guess. \n\n\nOP you should do what ever makes you happy but don't expect your dad to constantly be miserable just to make you happy. You talk about how youd like this to continue to other family events as well including kids/birthdays who knows whats next. That just isn't fair to your dad. \n\n\nIf you truly wanted your dad there you would just arrange it so that your mother is there before or after your dad. Your dad had said he was fine with that.

I also don't believe your father ever had either of these things, if you truly love someone who doesn't love you back you wouldn't attempt to force them into a marriage with the hopes they'll love you someday, seems like he needs some serious help and hopefully he can reach this conclusion someday but until then you may have to distance yourself in order to preserve your own happiness and healthy relationships.",

She cheated and left what sounded like a really unhappy marriage. I think you're starting to understand that no story is 100% black and white.

It sucks, because we enjoy spending time with his mom, she's wonderful, but we don't want to deal with the tug-of-war and we *especially* will not subject our children to that. My husband grew up feeling guilty and manipulated all the time and our children will never experience that. We won't allow it. \n\n\nIt sounds like your dad has made your parents' failed marriage somehow relevant to you and your relationship with both of them. A marriage is private, even when there's a family involved, and I guarantee that there are a lot of things that you don't know about. That's not to say that you should be easier or more forgiving with your mom, you should feel comfortable with whatever relationship you do or don't have with her. However, by involving yourself in your mom's affair and your parents' marriage, you've made yourself a party in that marriage, in your dad's eyes, so it might take some time for him to move past what comes across as a \"betrayal\" of sorts. You should never have to take sides between your parents, even when one of them irreparably hurts the other. ",

She wound up breaking up with her before that could happen (because surprise, he was a lying sack of shit.)\n\nIn your position I would write a letter or email to both parents telling them that you're tired of being the one to suffer for their mistakes.

The way she chose to end her marriage was awful and immature but like you said, your dad probably isn't an angel either.

He's making you choose between the two parents and that's not okay. \n\nMy mother and my father divorced when I was a baby. He was violent, there's no other way of saying it. He had a drug problem that he hid, he wanted to be in a band and tour, and a baby didn't help their already rocky marriage. \n\nThey separated. He gave her the house to raise me in. And you know what? I knew nothing of the bad things that happened between them (until my step father decided to tell me to hurt me when I was older..) because she knew I wanted to see my dad. He was a bit shit and sometimes he didn't turn up, but she kept at it, I saw him regularly eventually, she was cordial and pleasant. So was he. \nBecause *I needed my dad* and my mother at the same time. And no matter what happened, that was more important. \n\nI'm not saying your dad needs to forgive her. He doesn't have to, but for his own sanity he needs to see someone. \n\nIt's taken my dad 24 years to get help. And now he is much better. He has my sister and my step mother and her boys and he seems good. My mother isn't, she's had the worst luck with guys to be honest, but eventually she'll be okay. My dad went to a doctor and ended up with medication. I think it's good for him. He spent time with me years ago, tipsy and apologising. We went through utter shit for a while, he's upset me like parents do, but never ever once has said a bad word against my mother, and she hasn't said anything about him.\n*because they knew I needed them both*\n\nI'm sorry that he's behaving the way he is. I'm sorry that your life has been in turmoil because of a mistake your mother made. \n\nI've been cheated on a LOT in my lifetime, too much some may say.. However it's someone's very poor choice to do that. It's hurtful and horrible but I can't imagine forcing my children (if I had them) to choose between two people they love and need. \n\nI just wanted to support you a bit, I didn't realise that something like this would cause so much animosity your way! \n\nPlease enjoy your day, you'll be okay.

This is a dude who has barely moved on *at all.* He was so depressed, hasn't been with anyone else, and he still mentions how much he hates his ex every time we see him. But for the wedding, he prepared himself, he was there and he was civil. Because he's a grown up. Your dad can do the same, but he chooses not to.

And I wanted to tell you, well done. \nIt is completely not okay to push his hurt onto you or your brother. \nIts a horrible thing to experience, I know but your children arent at fault, and you should never have to choose between your parents. \nHere is my experience: my mother and father were crazy in love. Like just obsessed with each other, all the family got along great and after a long while of dating, they chose to get married. Around this time, my father got back into drugs, I guess the commitment freaked him out or whatever his excuse was, but he did. He cheated on my mother, with a close friend's girlfriend. Everyone went crazy, their friends were telling her to cancel the wedding, both families were, I mean she had to really make a decision. And my dad said he wanted to be married, and he made a mistake. \nThey got married. most of their friends refused to come. My parents look so so sad on their wedding day, their photo album makes me cry. Soon after, my mother lost a baby. It really hurt them both, and my dad was still using, without my mother knowing. They tried for another baby, and I came along. She unfortunately become very unwell, and was placed in a hospital with me for around 5 months.When she came home, my father was happy to see her. He had his little family. And she was happy for the most part. Until she found out the amount of drugs my dad was still using and was very upset. She kind of knew my dad was intense, but never towards her, and unforgivably, my dad hit her. He smashed a glass door. He pushed and shoved her. She is 5 foot 3 inches. Shes tiny, and she'd just come back from hospital with a 5 month old, she wasnt in any frame of mind to do anything, until he lost his temper one day and pushed her while she was holding me. His wedding ring scraped my stomach. She told him to leave and he didnt question it. He knew what he'd done. And as an aside, I have had to listen to him constantly tell me how guilty he feels and he'll never forgive himself, he knows he did a disgusting thing to her. \n\n\nThis long background is to illustrate my point of, it is completely possible to have any family event with both sides. What my dad did, has absolutely heinous. He left and got divorced and I didnt see him until I was about 3. My mother had a great partner at that point, and my dad wanted to be in my life. So she never told me a thing about it. I saw my dad and his parents on the weekend, and I had my family at home all week. Both sets of my grandparents were smitten with me as I was the first grandchild and they promised each other that I wouldnt ever know the tension or hurt everyone felt, because they had one common goal; being my grandparents. \n\n\nMy mother had my birthdays, with everyone there. It then progressed to *everyone's* birthdays. We all went as one family. And its always been the same since. Incidentally, my father now would rather not see my mother, I dont really know exactly why. But he's never made it a huge issue. Both sets of my grandparents see each other for lunch, without me being there. Theyre friends. \n\n\nif it hadnt have been for my mother deciding that *her* hurt wasnt necessarily mine, and that she knew that my father wasnt dangerous, but extremely damaged, and very likely to have bipolar issues (turns out he did) then I wouldnt have the supportive unit that I can turn to in a crisis. I have so much love from my family, and they all put their personal opinions aside, their issues, because it was worth it, to make sure that I had a family, not a broken one. \n\n they made my childhood perfect. And I will always be grateful for them putting their problems aside for me. It can be done. \n\n\nAnd you are not unreasonable to want this. You did the right thing. ",
            "Wow!  You SO did the right thing and you handled it all in SUCH a good way.  The ideal way.  And your (and Steve's) analysis sounds spot on.  And to suggest seeing a therapist who was familiar with your background?  God, this Steve of yours is a keeper!\n\nAnd so young to be so smart!  \n\nBest of luck to you and your future (with Steve).",
            "You did the right thing. Everyone is a grown up now. Focus on your new family and your parents should be able to put aside differences for at least one day for your wedding. If they can't, it's their own fault. You and your brother are grown, and your dad should be able to move on while being thankful that he seems to have two mature and well adjusted children. He should be proud, not bitter.",
            "Great job of setting firm boundaries with both of them! Hope your dad does some growing up fast. ",
            "So, you have tea with mommy and now your father is the bad passive-aggressive guy\nYou don't get to say when one is over the pain of being cheated on. \n",
            "It's not your job to mediate. Invite them both and tell them if they start anything they're both out.",
            "I am very much familiar with what your father is feeling - cheating SUCKS. It's a hurtful thing to experience, the one difference between myself and him is that I grew from the experience and understood that I was not going to improve if some asshole was going to make me distrustful of anyone. He's being disrespectful to your wishes, even if there is a compromise to be made. Your mother understood the impact of her actions and not only understands your requests but understands your father's anger and hurt too. He needs to understand what is going on, and the less you entertain his shit behavior the more likely he is to realize that he was married to HER, your mother, and not to you or your brother.",
            "I just want to say that I find it brave for standing up for yourself. I've been in the middle of my parents divorce from hell. Ex: 8 years after the divorce my Mom cried when she found out I had spoken to my Dad. My Mom said she'd have all of her friends bring guns to my brothers wedding if my Dad showed up. I've been terrified to get married for 19 years. Bravo, you did the right thing standing up for yourself!  ",
            "i think you did good.",
            "I think your brother's had the right of this all along.  He hates her.  He can't stand her.  He won't have her in his life and that's his choice but he will suck it up and be there for you as a brother when he needs to be whether she's there or not.  He's allowed to choose but he's also respecting your choice.  Good man.",
            "I think you did the right thing, and I'm glad that you have such an awesome fiance by your side (and what sounds like a pretty great therapist!). I do think you made some important realizations: that your mom was overall an excellent mother to you even though she made an awful choice in her marriage, that anyone outside of the two people within the marriage can't know everything that goes on in it, that both your parents are human, and that your dad has actually been manipulating you quite a bit and using your love for him to hurt your mom and get back at her. It didn't come out as much in your first post, but frankly I was shocked at the level of manipulation he was pulling. I say this as someone who realized last year that my mother also pulls off manipulation like that, so I can relate to being blind to it before it suddenly becomes clear.\n\nI would suggest keeping up with the therapy and discussing with the therapist about your dad's manipulation/how it's been affecting you. But also begin to reconsider your relationship with your mom (and discuss that in therapy as well). Numerous times in the last post and this post you mentioned how you used to be very close to her, and do actually want to be closer, but you're stopping yourself because of what she did, and how that hurts you that you can't be close with her now. Yes, she made an awful choice. Yes it directly (and negatively) affected you. But perhaps it's time to start working on forgiving her. While your relationship might not ever be exactly the same as it was, it's okay to re-develop a close relationship with your mom. It *would not* be a betrayal to your father, whether he tries to manipulate you and tell you that it would be or not. A close relationship with her *does not mean* that you support how she chose to end her marriage. But she is still your mother whom you love and miss. And it sounds like she has been put through the consequences for 5 years already and has been respectful of your need for space. Don't keep punishing yourself for their marital mistakes.\n\nAgain, just something to consider discussing with your therapist.",
            "Honey, you can't make everyone happy, and it's not your job to make everyone happy. You did very well :)\n\nEnjoy your wedding!",
            "Bravo! You handled that perfectly. My parents did the same thing to me and it was awful. Finally 15 years later I don't feel horribly awkward when they are in the same space. I never allowed myself to give into their childish behavior and refused to cater to it. And not wanting to be left out they both came to every event and eventually it's worked out to something manageable. One day your family will get there too. \n\nDon't be so hard on your mom, you still can be close with her if YOU allow it. She's only human. She was unhappy. She did what she needed to do to not be miserable. We all make mistakes trying to find happiness in our lives, and it sure sounds like your poor mother has atoned for hers and accepted her mistake as her own. It takes an incredibly strong person to own your mistakes and accept the punishment your own children are inflicting upon you. She's not trying to make excuses or blame anyone else but herself.  Try to imagine living with your dad if you didn't love him. Put yourself in her shoes. You have already opened your eyes to the reality of the real person he is. I don't blame your mother at all. She seems incredibly humble and accepting and like the type of person I'd like to know, no matter if she cheated on someone or not. ",
            "Well done!  You ought to give lessons to the rest of us.",
            "I think you handled things beautifully. ",
            "I feel like you did what you had to do for yourself, so you can stay sane.  I think it's good for you.  Your dad is punishing you very unfairly for your mother's actions.  He may decide to not come to the wedding, but that's on him.  I wish you and Steve good luck and hope the wedding is a wonderful start to your future together.",

            "I'm very sorry to hear that. I also went through the same shit you're currently in. It took me and my siblings a very long time to realize that my parents are very selfish and prioritize their own happiness and egos before their own kids' well-being. Weddings and graduations are very important milestones in life, they should learn to put aside their own issues and be there for their child. They should be there and be happy for their own kid, not make the kid miserable with their own petty issues. \n\nEveryone matures physically, but only a few people choose to mature emotionally and psychologically. We have little to no control to what other people think, act and say. But we have control over our own. Try not to think about what your parents think, and focus on yourself and your own happiness. You deserve to enjoy your own wedding, don't let them ruin your own happiness.\n\nBtw, my parents did the exact same thing your parents did during my wedding. I totally ignored them and just did my thing. Let them wallow in their own immaturity. Hopefully by showing that you no longer tolerate their shit, your parents might realize that they need to grow up.",
            "Ugh, kind of reminds me of my father. My parents have been divorced for almost my entire life, and he's done the \"subtle\" manipulation thing too, though my mom never cheated or did anything terrible in the marriage. My dad owes my mom *a lot* of back child-support for me, and though I'm 23, the state the family court case is from still makes the owing parent pay every single cent, no statute of limitations. My mother desperately needs this child support to make ends meet, but she always has given him the benefit of the doubt through his unemployment and such, and never sent the court after him for what he owes. \n\nSo months back, my mom reminds him that he needs to make a payment, and he claims to not have any money. My mom knows this is bull, and reminds him that she has never contacted family services, but she will if she has to. He blows up on her and makes (nonviolent) empty threats and calls her names and such. My mom calls me sobbing, and I am enraged over the situation. At some point, my dad tries to call me, but I text him saying that I will talk to him only after he has apologized to her. He tells me that if I'm going to take her side, then he doesn't want me in his life. \n\nBig loss. I always dreaded having to talk to him/see him after I started dating my husband. He didn't bother to remember my husband's name, even after I'd been married for over a year. He also drove nearly 1000 miles (in my direction) to see a kid he forced a girlfriend to give up for adoption over 25 years ago, but decided I wasn't worth the extra half-day of driving. So after years of forcing myself to interact with him, I was not exactly bending to his very clear manipulation. \n\nHe hasn't called me once, but he's called my husband's phone many times and left messages asking when I was going to stop being mad and \"tell your wife to call me\" type texts. Needless to say my husband isn't allowed to answer/respond and I'm not calling him. I find it insulting that he tries to bring my husband into this and manipulate him. He can grow up and call me himself, or not. Not my loss. ",

Brush it off, plan your wedding, and enjoy this moment in your life with the people who care about you and your happiness. \n\nReally, he's trying to make it about him. He knows the idea of him and your mother seeing you wed off is very important to you. He's using it. Taking advantage of it. Trying to use your emotions in this matter to satisfy what *he* wants. Because, to him, his wants are more important than your happiness. His sense of hate and spit is so large it eclipses the happiness of his daughter on the most important day of her life.\n\nSo don't let it be important. Both of them seeing you, yes, it would be nice. But he cares more about his wants in this than your wants. So don't care. Write him off, move on, and enjoy the company of the people who *will* be there. They're the ones that will share their time with you. They'll make the moment beautiful with you.\n\nAnd, your father?

When a parent dies early and leaves a child behind, it is profoundly difficult to get past the dead parent always being a parent and not just another human. It sounds like you made that step and are able to view two humans who are flawed as an adult viewing adults. The next step is to be able to find a way to love them despite their flaws. I hope your dad comes around.",
            "OP, I realize this thread has gotten pretty long but I just wanted to commend you for the way that you handled this. I have a set of parents who also had an acrimonious divorce, and my father also hates  my mother for the way it happened. He included me in their problems and fostered animosity between my mother and I the way your father did, and I loved him and wanted to support him. Eventually our relationship fell apart when my relationship with my mother healed some and i wanted to be able to include both of them in things like graduations and finally fractured, funnily enough, over my own wedding, where his pain was dictating what he wanted the event to look like (20 years after the divorce)- long story short he disowned me. It hurt like hell but I have come to realize he made his own choices and I have to make mine too. I tried to do the best I could by my father, but it wasn't enough for him, and that is on him, not me. The same goes for your father. You did all you can do, and you should be proud of the way you handled it. I hope you have a beautiful wedding and a long and happy marriage with your fiance. ",

This is his problem to deal with and though his reaction may make you feel like you're now taking your moms side, you're not. You're being neutral and people react to that how they choose to.

I would say that he'll never become reasonable until he has some realisation of who he is an changes his life.

There is no reason why you can't be close to her again. I'm sure my opinion will not be popular but this is the truth. And this is coming from someone who has been cheated on multiple times.

What your mom did was absolutely unforgivable, and if your dad dies without ever forgiving her, he'll still be right.  You absolutely shouldn't have to choose between them, but that's the position your mother put you in.

Luckily my parents are healthier in that they will be in a room or ever gasp a photo together, but my mom wishes they could be friends while My dad keeps the relationship business only. It can be awkward, but they never made us choose between them. I guess I'm just saying this because I maintain a close relationship with both my parents, including my mom who cheated. In your post, it sounds like you have some grief over the fact that you and your mom can never be close again. But I think you can be. Relationships are complicated. It's easy to mess up. People are judged harshly for cheating, which is fine, but there are other terrible things people can do that are subtle and stretched out over time... Your parents may well be equally at fault, even though it was your mom who committed the dramatic betrayal. I know that's true of my parents. Unfortunately your dad's behavior makes things so complicated, but in your heart you're allowed to forgive her. That doesn't mean you think it was okay. But we all have done things that aren't ok. Your mom can still be a good person who made a dramatic mistake, and you are allowed to be close to her again if that will make you happy.\n\nI'm sorry things turned out this way with your dad.

However, we were really young at the time and they wouldn't have been missing anything major like a wedding.

I will never stop resenting my parents for that.\n\nI hope your story has a happier ending than mine. After 17 years of divorce and hatred and ruining their children's lives, _my parents got back together_ so now they can hate each other and make each other miserable from inside the same house. \n\nGod help us.",
            "You absolutely did the right thing. Your father was hurt--FIVE YEARS AGO! Time to move on! He has no right to try to poison you against your mother. Also, if you are now just seeing what a manipulating, passive-aggressive bully he is now, as your father, what kind of a husband was he to your mother? This is not to justify your mother's infidelity, since she should have left him first before moving onto the next guy. However, marital breakdowns are rarely 100% one person's fault. ",
            "I think you did awesome, OP, and I wish you the best. Usually people here are so quick to call out behavior like your dad's (honestly, even when it's not warranted), but I guess the  cheating sob story won out this time.\n\nI wish you the best and I hope your dad comes around.",
            "This is one of the best updates ever. I am actually proud of you op, you've done great, especially considering what terrible advice you were getting in the original post (I wasn't there when you posted it, but after just having read through the comments, I couldn't believe my eyes. Wtf Reddit?) \n\nI think you should aim to become closer to your mother, I don't see why you shouldn't. She may have messed up as a wife, but it seems that she didn't mess up as a mother and you should keep that in mind. I think you've punished her enough.",
            "This is one of the best things I have read on this forum.  What I witnessed in this explanation is a child who just outgrew their parent.  It is gut wrenching and goes against every instinct there is, but you navigated through an extremely difficult situation with grace.  Bravo!\n\n>Basically both my parents are human and mistakes were made from both sides. My mom had the affair yes, but it's not like my dad was the perfect man either.\n\nThis is really the crux of the whole thing.  It is sad when you finally come to the realization that your parents are deeply flawed people.  I see childhood as a process of letting go and watching your child become a real adult.  Sometimes a parent really can't get there, and it seems like your dad is just \"stuck\" in his ideas about what he thinks your role should be.  It also sounds like some of the behaviors he is displaying with you is related to \"black and white\" type of thinking - you are either with him or against him.  I hope that he can get some help and move on with his life in a healthier direction.    ",
            "Just wanted to point out\n\n\"Dad also said I couldn't understand because I hadn't been cheated on, I didn't know what real love was and also implied it was MY fault and my brothers fault\"\n\nApparently he doesn't respect your relationship with your fianc\u00e9 if he thinks you \"don't know what real love is.\" I've dealt with passive aggressiveness, this takes the cake for me.\n\n",

            "Reading your post struck a nerve. My mom waited to leave my dad the day after my honeymoon. I wouldn't graduate till years after the divorce. My dad is a narcissist I love him but he is also passive aggressive and blames her for leaving as he believes marriage is forever. My mom married young and got sucked up in Internet romance to her credit she left before meeting the online dude it ended badly. The divorce was no fault and done swiftly. When I graduated college I invited both neither came. Dad said he was sick mom supposedly had her car break down. \n\nOn my end it sucked my mom was always like my best friend now there's a disconnect. I try but I get angry and bitter with each new boyfriend she gets. Dad I am more of a friend to than her which is odd but it's hard. My brother is like yours guarded and blame seeking. He doesn't have a relationship with her. \n\nMy only twist is my cousin has a weird overly close relationship with my mother that makes me feel uncomfortable in the sense that she acts like she's my mother's daughter and I don't matter. \n\nI think adult divorce is more damaging because you endured the ups and downs and it makes you question the life you had. What's worse you become a pawn in a situation that should be kept civil. \n\nI think in the long haul you did the right thing sitting both down. I would still attempt to send dad a letter stating your wedding is about your day of celebration and not his insecurities and you would like him for once to step up and be there as a wedding gift to you. As long as you tried in writing which I'd make a copy of then I'd let it go. \n\nYou are entering a union of you and Steve. Not a union of a Jerry Springer episode.  You did all you could be at peace with that. Congrats on your wedding. Huge hugs. \n\nPS If dad does come around have someone monitor his drinking at the reception. If he's depressed it can be augmented with the alcohol. ",
            "It'd pretty clear from your post why your mother cheated on your dad and why she needed to get away from him. Cheating is bad, but sometimes it's the best option to get oneself out of a bad situation. I'm glad that you're starting to see that. ",
            "I think your problem is that you took sides. My parents split up when was in my early 20s and my mother left for someone else.\n\nMy brother and I made it quite clear they were both still our parents and we weren't going to take sides or agree to any silly demands. ",
            "There aren't a lot of truly happy moments in the life of a modern man these days. You work. You have your routine. I think the only time your dad was ever happy was when he had his family. And when something like that means so much to you, even if it isn't even real, you can convince yourself that it is. \n\nIt's like that stupid wave thing from Star Trek Generations. Your dad lost all of that and he feel like it was never his fault. And not only that, he has someone specifically to blame for it. He will never, EVER forgive her for that. The thing is, the old adage is that miserly loves company. So I think he wants vindication from you and your brother that he's right and she's wrong.\n\nIt's definitely childish. I really feel bad for you OP, and I think you've done the best you could given the circumstances. \n\nI hope your Dad can get his life back on track, rather than just sit in miserable solitude. For his sake as well as you and your brother's sake. ",
            ">While I still will never again be close to my mom \n\nYou use a lot of absolutes. I hope for your sake that this statement isn't true, because:\n\n>She may not have been a good wife but she WAS an excellent mother\n\nCorrection: she **is** an excellent mother.\n\nYour mother did not cheat on you. You've appropriated your father's hurt and anger which is a little creepy. When your friends disobey their parents, do you distance yourself from them for being bad sons/daughters? If your brother forgot his girfriend's birthday, would you stop talking to him because he was a bad boyfriend? If the answer is no, then I don't understand why you would nearly eliminate your relationship with your mother because she was not a good wife.\n\nAnd somehow, you find her being with the same person that she cheated with a bad thing. They obviously found something meaningful and important with one another that it lasted two divorces and five years together.\n\nI hope you continue on your path of understanding - I really do. I adore my mother and could never imagine cutting her out of my life on behalf of anyone, ever. She's human and imperfect and makes a lot of mistakes, but I'd be the last person to try to throw those mistakes in her face when they weren't against me directly. Yes, she hurt someone you love but chances are he hurt her, too, just in a less public way.\n\nShe's your mom. You don't get another. She hasn't ever asked you to choose and has respected all of your choices. Who else in your life has done that?\n\n\n",
            "You made the right call. I have been in both your shoes and your dad's. My mom cheated on and left my father 37 fucking years ago and he still refuses to be anywhere where she is. This is so hurtful - he has never been to my son's birthday parties or any other family celebrations. This tells me that his hatred for my mom is stronger than his love for me and his grandson. It's his loss, my son and I see him about 3 times a year for a couple of hours (he only lives 45 minutes away). \n\nMy son's father cheated on me throughout our relationship and I finally ended it when my son was about 3 months old. These days we go to school functions together, celebrate birthdays and Christmas together, and we all have dinner together once or twice a week very peacefully and happily (my son also sees his dad most weekends). This is so much easier than being angry and resentful for years, and my son is so much happier for it.\n\nI hope your dad sees what he's doing and gets some help.",
            "I hope you can fix your relationship with your mother.  She fucked up as a wife, but she wasn't your wife, she's your mother and it sounds like you two had a good mother-daughter relationship. Stay out of your father's drama, that should stay between your parents, don't get sucked into it even though your father's trying his hardest to do so.",
            "I\u2019m not gonna go off on your dad, like everyone has, it's like /u/etherpromo pointed out, being cheated on after 20 years is not something you brush off, it\u2019s a hard blow and you can\u2019t tell them to get over it simply because you have.\n\nHowever, I feel if anyone is worth investing in, it's your mother. Not because your father is acting immaturely, whereas your mother ahs been very sensible. In the end I don\u2019t think either of their actions are worse or better than the other\u2019s. It\u2019s because of two other things you said that stand out to me; \n\na) That he has always been passive agressive and mean, guilt-tripping people, making snide comments. Even acting this way toward his children. \n\nb) That he *knew* your mother didn\u2019t love him, but insisted she marry him anyway. Kept saying to her that she would love him eventually. Maybe your mother should have stood her ground, or maybe your dad practically bullied her into staying? Shouldn\u2019t he have seen the cheating coming? \n\nHe is not a good person.\n\nI also feel these are the real reasons you resent him, not because you feel he should be letting go of his anger after 5 years. After all, you say yourself you still keep a distance from your mom, calling your relationship \u2019strained and distant', claiming you can never be close again. Your brother called her a *whore*; you don\u2019t seem to think that was harsh. Neither did 'Mother can shove wedding etiquette up her ass' seem to be a problematic thing to say. So don\u2019t blame your father for still carrying anger, too.\nI suspect it\u2019s rather because you\u2019ve come to realise your father isn\u2019t the perfect dad you remember from your childhood, who you, like all kids, used to idolize. You\u2019re seeing him for who he is, and he has serious flaws. \n\nYou feel like he failed you. Your mother goes and cheats and splits up the family. Then, instead of him focusing extra on you kids, making sure you\u2019re okay and feeling loved and safe, he (albeit sublty) trashes your mother and makes you choose his side.You figure a parent in his position should show his children that at least *he\u2019ll* always be there for you, but now that he\u2019s refusing to be at your wedding, he\u2019s doing the opposite of that. SImultaneously, your mother has been nothing but lovely in a shitty situation, it\u2019s no wonder you dislike your dad at this point.\n\nYou should maybe points these things out to him for clarity. See, when you basically tell him you want nothing to do with him if he can\u2019t get over what your mother did (which is what it would take for him to be around her), from his perspective, his daughter is betraying him, thereby supporting the woman who hurt him. You don\u2019t have to agree with that sentiment, but do uderstand that from where he\u2019s standing, that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re doing.\n\nIf you tell him all this, he will better understand why you resent him. I know he\u2019s hurt you a lot, but he deserves to know why you\u2019re not speaking to him.\n",
            "Read the whole thing. Firstly please undesirable that usually the comments with more upvotes  is popular opinion, not the number of comments. :)\n\nSecondly awesomely handled really. I'm so sorry you have to deal with this. But you're dealing with it in a really nature way too. Realising there are shades if grey instead of black and white can be so tough. \n\nDo what is good for you op. You don't owe anyone anything. ",
            "The more I hear about your dad the more I feel like he's in the wrong and should be put on low contact. Sure, cheating is inexcusable no matter what, but I agree with most in this thread that in this case it seems understandable. Your father is selfish, manipulative, and emotionally abusive - and it's clear that he's been like that since before the affair. How manipulative do you have to be to convince someone to marry you, who doesn't even love you, in hopes that just maybe eventually it'll work? I understand this might've began in a different time period where people felt more pressured to get married, but come on. And the fact that it lasted so long? (I'm assuming because of you and your brother). \n\nAnd now, 5 years after the affair, he's still playing the victim. Even to the point that he's turning the blame for his depression entirely on you and your brother and openly telling you that. What a shitty parent. I've been cheated on, it's rough, but jeeze. Don't blame your kids. The dude needs a reality check and therapy. He should be the one walking on egg shells around you from now on. \n\nYour mom has been great. You don't ever have to feel like you have to meet her new partner, but hear me out. Consider her relationship with your father and the fact that she never felt like she loved him. For almost (or at least?) twenty years your mother was with a man she never loved. Maybe, eventually, you can be happy for her? She may finally be happy and at peace now that she's in a relationship with someone she (hopefully) loves. Someone else mentioned the fact that she's still with the same guy 5 years later (if that's true) seems to prove something about the affair or the relationship. Take that for what you will, but consider it.\n\nAnyways, congrats on handling this so amazingly and  good luck on your wedding! Your future husband seems to be a swell guy.\n\nEdit: I knew this would be unpopular with /r/relationships, maybe it was the last part? I still hope /u/woozlefangirl considers it. Or was it because I demonized the person who was cheated on who is now being manipulative and emotionally abusive? This sub has a real issue with making cheating so black and white. The dad needs to have an attitude adjustment before he gets OP's respect too. Anyway, she has already said herself that both of her parents are only human and have made mistakes. I think it's not totally insane to one day be happy for her mother's happiness. ",
            "I feel for your mother and completely understand why she cheated. Cut him out if he continues to threaten you and force you to do stupid life decisions you will regret in the future.",
            "I agree that your dad is acting childish and toxic. He really ought to keep his negative attitude to himself, and he doesn't get to dictate the relationship you and your brother have with your mom. \n\nI don't feel as forgiving toward your mother as some of the other responders, though. I agree that she's been handling the situation maturely when it comes to you and your brother, not making excuses and demands and letting you have your space. In that regard, she's acting a hell lot more mature than your father. \n\nHowever, I strongly disagree with the sentiment that she made a mistake, it's all in the past, and she's acting with complete integrity now. The fact is, she's still with her affair partner. He's the symbol of what ultimately broke your family apart, and she's still with him to this day. Personally (and this may not be a popular opinion) I think she should break it off with him if she were truly remorseful. ",
            "So your father wanted you to pick between him and her, because she completely betrayed him. You picked her.\n\nDon't expect to have a relationship with your father. It's been 5 years, but they were married for more than that. What your mother did to your father is unforgivable, and he hasn't and won't forgive her. I don't blame him for never wanting to see her or be near her again.\n\nYour mother has had it easy. She got her lover. She was never betrayed. She has had the easy path to being reasonable and fair, because she spent years lying and cheating. \n\nWhat happened between your parents will keep them apart for the rest of their lives. You know this, and you're picking your mother. I hope you made the right choice.",
            "You made exactly the right call. Your mother made a mistake. A bad one, but a mistake nonetheless. She has fully accepted the consequences. Meanwhile your dad is taking something bad that happened to him years ago and using it to manipulate you. Fuck that shit. I'm engaged as well and my fianc\u00e9s parents are divorced, but they can be in the same room without making their children coordinate them at all times. If he can't act like an adult he shouldn't be treated like one.",
            "You're father is acting like a spoiled, manipulative brat! If he's making you feel this bad imagine what he did to your mother over the years. He should've NEVER turned you against her. Just because the marriage didn't work out why should you suffer without your mother? Their marriage is none of your business at this point and never should've been. Children are never supposed to deal with adult situations. They should be loved. Obviously your mother is the only one with your best interests at heart and is just overjoyed to have you in her life. Stop letting him do this to you. Be close with your mother again. He should be ashamed of himself. ",
            "First off, you handled this the best way possible, good job. \n\nBut the way you talked about your parent's marriage, how \"I know my mom cheated, but mistakes were made on both sides,\" just sits wrong with me. Yeah, mistakes may have been made on both sides, but there's mistakes, and then there's cheating. Pretty big difference. \n\nIt doesn't excuse the way your dad acts, or the fact that he won't seek help and would rather hold on to his anger and resentment than see his daughter get married. But cheating can ruin a person's life, and it sounds like What's happened here. \n\nTl;dr I agree %100 with your brother. Except I probably wouldn't talk to her at the wedding. ",
            "Hopefully this is the impetus he needs to get some help.  To not be able to set aside your feelings for a few hours for your daughter's sake means that he needs help.",
            "Seems like you handled everything very well.  Good job.",
            "As someone who's dating and plan on marrying someone with divorced parents this is honestly my biggest fear that his parents will be too wrapped up in their post divorce drama to come to our wedding. That being said, everything you did was very well done and honestly, there isn't much more you can do from here. You've said your piece to both parents and it's up to them to decide whether or not their past is going to impede on your future. Best of luck to you, OP",
            "You did the right thing. (I don't have the strength to read any comments, but read your entire update and liked it, thanks).",
            "I think you did the right thing, good luck with your future. Much love.",
            "I think you handled this perfectly. More grown up than many adults twice your age. \nHe's definitely milking it. Especially given what you now know about their relationship. \nChin up. Hopefully he stops being selfish and shows up. He will regret it if he doesn't. \n\nMy mom filed for divorce from my step dad after almost 15 years of being together. 5 just dating. \n\nI was crushed, they seemed so happy. He was heartbroken. I finally asked mom why. She said when he asked, she told him flat out she didn't love him in that way, but if he wanted to be the father to her children she would marry him until we were all out of the house. \n\nIt was so fucked up imo. Why would he agree to that. I'm happy he did, he was more of a father figure in my life than I could have imagined. \nPeople are weird. ",
            "I get this.  My parents divorced when I was an adult and it was brutal.  So many terrible truths came to light and there was a lot of hate on either side.  And while it was a really ugly time in my life, I never stopped asking both parents to be at my life events.  I told them in no uncertain terms that they were parents and adults and to act like it.  You absolutely have the right to expect your parents to act like the adults they are.  Your mom seems to be doing it right.  Your dad seems emotionally abusive.  He's using you to hurt your mom.  That's not okay.  ",
            "Also for him to say that you dont know what it feels like to be cheated on is complete bullshit. Your mum cheated on your father, does he think you werent affected at all by that!? It DOES feel personal!!",
            "1. Your dad is truly fucked up over this and needs SERIOUS mental help. \n2. By putting conditions on your mom's actions at your wedding, you are still doing exactly what he wants you to do. They are both adults and should be capable of managing that situation without conditions placed on them. \n3. You said you'll NEVER be close with your mom? And Why not? How much of the anger and separation that you have fostered was a byproduct of your dads emotional issues? A whole lot id say. Sure you can be mad at your mom for what happened, but not having a close relationship with her because of this is just wrong. I feel bad for her, to be honest. Nothing makes what she did right, but she has been with this man since the affair. They ended their marriages as a result and have stayed together through some serious shit, I'd imagine. Looks like she has someone she really loves in her life. And maybe that's not such a bad thing. \n",
            "awesome. Your dad is being absurd, and SO SO selfish",
            "In my family any come together, like a wedding, or something a lot smaller like a birthday is impossible after my parents divorce. You (OP) are very fortunate to have a mother who's very understanding. And a brother, who seems willing to put differencies aside, for your big day. If your dad doesn't show up, it's his loss. Don't let that get to you. If he's anything like my mother, he'll be staying home thinking to himself \"I hope she miss me on her big day. Well now she'll see what misery is.  And if she'd wanted me to be there, she wouldn't have invited *HER*!\" \n... don't let that ruin your day, it's all about you and your husband.\n\n... at my sisters wedding, she didn't invite our mother, she did however invite our step mother. Which our older sister disagreed with, so she didn't turn up! It was all very stressful for my sister,  but in the end she had a lovely day, she told me that all that stress, seemed so silly now. Because really, it was a day for her and her husband.  And they enjoyed their day to the fullest. \n\nYou did the right thing, concerning your dad. And I really hope, you'll be able to have a great relationship, with your mother again. \n\nAnd also, congratulations on your coming big day. I wish you all the best",

Living together in the same house as you're divorcing is a very bad idea. Either/both of you could turn really spiteful and damage your case in any future divorce proceedings. \n\nWhen I got divorced I was able to make my husband leave because he had a place to go (his parents lived nearby) but I did not. This wasn't a legal agreement, but since he was the immediate cause of the divorce (meaning the straw that broke the camel's back, not entirely at fault, which your wife is in this case) he was willing to leave so I didn't have to. Maybe she'll be reasonable.\n\nWe lived in an apartment so there was no splitting of a house, but as you surely learned from /r/legaladvice unless you owned the house and she moved into it and there was a statement about retaining ownership in your prenup, or if she agrees to let you keep the house (usually in exchange for other assets such as a car or you paying off a debt of hers, something like that) you'll likely have to sell and divide the house in the divorce. \n\nI know everything in you is telling you to be mad right now because you're hurt and betrayed, but the best way to get through divorce is try and be cool and rational about it. If you act with anger you'll wind up making yourself bitter for the rest of your life; making a clean break and just severing all ties was the healthiest way for me. He wanted to be friends for the longest time and I refused (and always will), then after a couple years he started asking me to spend time with him so we could have \"closure\" but I already had closure (in that I had excised him from my life) and owed him no more of my emotional energy. Anger wouldn't have been healthy for me and would've just cause further aggravation with him. \n\nDo whatever works best for you, try to keep in mind your mental and emotional health in the future as well though. \n\nGood luck to you.",

This is a messed up update to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3o3443/me_24_f_with_my_boyfriend_25_m_5_years_he_wants/) post\n\n\nIt's been the most intense day in my entire life and I feel drained and sick and every other messed up emotion. Please bear with me, this is probably going to be all over the place. \n\n\nSo yesterday after reading all the comments (not to mention some other threads for other more general advice). You guys were right, I was looking at this issue as a single problem rather than the entire relationship as whole. Basically, this update isn't really about a dog at all, we had way bigger issues.\n\n\nI left the house for a bit with the dogs and thought about what I wanted from this relationship. I figured that we could use some alone time with no distractions to talk so I left them with my aunt and went back home. I get back to my boyfriend - I'll call him Dan from here on out. He was playing a game with his headphones on. I asked if we could talk and the conversation went like this:\n\n\n**Me:** Hey, I need to talk to you, can you come off the game next time you can save?\n\n\n**Dan:** Why?\n\n\n**Me:** We can talk properly after you've finished on the game.\n\n\nHe can sometimes be awhile depending on what he's doing in a game so I started cleaning up around the house while I waited. He comes over after about 30 minutes or so and just stares at me.\n\n\n**Me:** I've been thinking about our relationship a lot lately and there's some things I'm not really happy with and so I was hoping we could sit down and talk through it?\n\n\n**Dan:** Okay\n\n\n**Me:** For awhile now I feel like i've been doing the majority of the housework, cleaning and taking care of the animals for awhile and it gets really tiring when most of my time is taken up by that but you still have loads of free time. I was thinking we could get up a chore schedule to give me a bit of a break?\n\n\n**Dan:** But I'm happy with how things are.\n\n\n**Me:** You're still happy even knowing how unhappy I am?\n\n\n**Dan:** That's your problem to solve, not mine.\n\n\nHe just walked back into the living room and put his headset back on. I followed him in and asked why he was walking away but he ignored me and just went back to playing games. I went upstairs and called my brother, Sam.\n\nI didn't really know who else to call. My dad worries too much and my mum means well but everything gets round the family quickly if you tell her anything. My brother though, he's the best. He's 4 years older than me but we were always close. Whatever pride and dignity I had left at that point were gone as soon as he answered. Just a mess of words and crying.\n\n\nI wanted to tell him what happened so bad but I've never ever told anyone the bad parts of the relationship. Maybe because I knew what other people would say? I don't know. But when I was trying to tell Sam I just felt so beaten and at a loss. I stayed on the phone with my brother for a few minutes but I didn't even know where to start so I just told him that I was breaking up with Dan and I needed help to get some stuff out if he had the time. He said he'd be right over.\n\n\nI calmed myself down and started getting some of my things together. Dan come upstairs to use the bathroom and saw me packing some clothes. He came into the room and asked if I was leaving. I said yes. To that, he said okay and went back downstairs.\n\n\nAfter I'd got some clothes together, I went downstairs and started getting the animals things together. He saw me and told me that I was not taking the animals. I said that he doesn't look after them anyway so what does it matter to him if I take them? I went to move around him to pick some other stuff up but he pushed me into the wall and said \"stop being fucking stupid, you're not leaving and even if you did you can't have the animals\".\n\n\nI just mumbled excuse me and went back to the bedroom and just sat. He came up after me a few minutes later and started apologising. I asked him to leave me alone and that I needed some space but he got in my face again and started shouting about being ungrateful and a bitch... and a lot of other names. He started getting physical again and pushed me down onto the bed. He kept yelling about how I should be happy and just take it. I was screaming and trying to get him off me but he's way stronger than me.\n\n\nI am so so so lucky that Sam turned up when he did. He said that he could hear all the yelling and screaming from outside. He couldn't get down the front door so he had ran around to the back and broke the glass on the patio doors.He ran into the room and before I could even ask him to help, Dan was pinned on the floor and Sam was over him. My brother is not a violent person. He's pretty much a chilled out hippe without the long hair but he punched Dan really hard a few times and said that if he ever came near me again then he'd kill him. We called the police and he was taken away, he'll probably be let out soon but I'll be working on getting a restraining order asap. \n\n\nFor now I'm staying with Sam and he's been... there's no words, the best brother in the world. He helped me back my stuff and he's okay with the animals staying with him too.\n\n\nSorry this is really long.. I don't really know what to do now. I'm really scared that Dan will turn up again but Sam has put some extra locks on the front door and on the spare room so I feel safer and I'll be the landlord tomorrow to explain in case he tries to destroy the house and blame it on me... so yeah, messed up. How the hell did I even get into this situation. But thank you again for your comments, even if it was a shit situation, I'm out of there now and hopefully I'll never see Dan again.\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Broke up with boyfriend, got attacked, brother to the rescue. In shock and feel beaten.\n\n\n**edit:** I woke up this morning and just cried. My brother came to check on me a few times and then brought some breakfast to me - yes, my brother is amazing and I will have to find him the best Christmas presents ever.\n\n\nLuckily, or unluckily whichever way you view it, I bruise really easily and I can already sort of see some bruises coming up. Sam suggested going over to the hospital once they've come up and getting them documented just in case Dan denies it all.\n\n\nI cannot thank you enough for all of your support, your advice has been so helpful and I will be following through on the charges and seeking legal help for my pets. You've helped keep me sane in this whole situation and even though I feel like shit, I'm so glad I'm out of there. Thank you.",

You're going to go through a whole range of emotions in the next few days, then the next few weeks, then the next few months.

Days of sadness, a week of anger, feeling cold clarity and thinking that maybe you're past the worst, and then suddenly plunging back into depression. The most important thing is to be patient with yourself. Let the emotions wash over you and don't feel that you have to push them away.  \n\nAlso, keep your friends and family around you. Reach out to them and ask them to support you. Ask them to help you make decisions when you're feeling too distressed to make them yourself. Ask them to go with you to the shop just because you feel scared. Ask them to come over and just sit whilst you watch a movie. They will be there for you.\n\n*hugs* Good luck. You'll be fine. ",

This guy didn't care about you *at all*. You were an object to him. I'm not trying to gloss over the horrific physical beating he gave you, because it is unarguably horrific, but this is the thing that absolutely floored me. You are in a far *far* better situation with that sociopath on the way out of your life. Do go to the hospital. Do get the pictures taken. Trust your really awesome brother. He's going to have a clearer head about everything right now. Once all that is done, well, you don't need me to tell you to try to put all this behind you. Take care.",

            "Hey OP. Wow. First of all you are amazing! Too many girls/guys in this sub take such over the top crap from their so's and they take it. I am so impressed with you and your brother . I wish you safety and happiness. I read that you are listed for all the micro chips so I really hope you get your animals (but I think you will :) ",
            "You did exactly what couples in a bind should do: Communicate. You saw that there was a problem and took steps to communicate this to him, so that the two of you could address it as a couple.\n\nJust a few things to add...\n\nFirst of all, I'm glad you got out of that mess. No one deserves to be treated like that. I was in a similar situation once. I was in a relationship with a petulant man-child who refused to talk things out with me or even take into consideration my feelings on certain matters. His reaction was the polar opposite of your now-ex's (crying, begging me to stay, even asking me to marry him), but I didn't buy it and I'm glad you didn't give in! \n\nSecond of all, your brother is amazing. So many women find themselves in dangerous situations like this, some I know personally. If I could, I would buy that man a steak or a beer (depending on his preference, of course). Once things get settled down, I'd treat him to something nice and reiterate how appreciative you are of his help in an extraordinarily difficult situation.\n\nFinally, I don't think I have to echo this, since it's been stated several times, but I will anyway: Legal action. Press charges. Go forward with that restraining order. Take any necessary steps to ensure he will pay for what he did to you and hopefully he will never, ever try to do that to another woman. Accept zero apologies from him, since you know they won't be sincere. Cut off contact where you can. Watch out for yourself, your brother, and your pets. Until this guy is away from you for good, you need to take any steps necessary to stay safe. ",

Im not one of those self proclaimed \"nice guys\", (I'm as narcissistic as they come)  but even I wonder how other people can be like this. Is it just pent up frustration of knowing you're not with the right person but at the same time knowing that things couldn't get any better for you?  I could never bring myself to physical violence of any kind on anybody, male or female. I just get so floored whenever I hear a story like this as to how these seemingly semi normal people can turn into such shitheads whenever any conflict arises. Is it just bad parenting or is there actually more to it ? ",

He was a lazy man child to begin with and that's not going to change. Don't ever talk to him again. So glad your brother is amazing!",

I really hope everything works out okay.\n\nI say stay with your brother for as long as you feel comfortable and he's okay with it until your ex cools off.\n\nI really hope everything works out for you. Also thanks so much for taking care of the animals. Do whatever you can to keep those poor animals. I see people all too often leave pets behind for dumb reasons and it's great that you are still taking care of them. Here in the USA animals are mostly considered property so the police aren't likely to come and grab them if it's in a custody dispute between ex romantic partners/roomates. So hopefully you can keep them until after you prove your case and then get awarded full custody.\n\nIf you ever need help paying for some of their food or something make sure to post on reddit somewhere I'm sure lots of people will help.",

You've just been through an awful shock as well as a major life change. You've experienced a trauma.... someone you trusted assaulted you. Thats a lot to unpack.
