        "selftext": "[Original post] \n(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6tntf0/my_m42_gf_f36_of_2_years_she_says_she_likes_to_be/)\n\n\nWhen I made my original post, I was feeling at an impasse and thinking I was going to end a relationship I valued, only because our sex life was starting to slacken.  Initial responses were confirming this fear \"oh you have a dead bedroom... bail on that\"\n\n\nThen I got a few comments about our poor communication, which I kindof knew... but also about how my perception of what my GF was saying she wanted (being taken) was in fact me being stubborn about what I thought it would make me to fulfill that role for her.  \n\n\nI think, being my age, I get prone to thinking I know a lot.. but in some aspects, I'm as stupid/innocent about things as it can get.  \n\n\nPrior to the post, I was pretty strict about \"anytime someone utters no, that is full stop\".  I haven't changed the spirit of this - but the comments also lead me to understand that sometimes knowing that you drive a person so crazy they just can't keep their paws off you, lead me to realize I do in fact feel that way about my GF - and that I was intentionally suppressing something that she likely really wanted to feel.\n\n\nSince the post, the next time we went out, I intentionally was oogling her and telling her ways I was attracted to how she was behaving, looking.  I also took a quick second to tell her that I've been thinking about our bedroom issues and that I decided upon a safe word that she could use later if needed... I told her the word, then went back to smirking at her as I looked her up and down and... she was just radiant about it.  She lit up with smiles and I literally could just tell I had said exactly the right thing to her.  \n\n\nI'm a \"physical touch\" person and I just notice when she gives more than not - but her contact frequency with me has been outstanding since then (it had dwindled).  Our bedroom situation has shifted to zero complaints for me as well - but our general connection just seems to be a complete reverse from where I felt it was.\n\n\nI don't think my original post gained much attention, but I wanted to post an update to thank those who took the time to respond and help me out.  This literally took the best possible direction for me - better than I had hoped for in fact.  It wouldn't have been possible without those who took time to respond.\n\n\nAs for me, I already knew there are things I'm ignorant about, but it was another good lesson to realize I can be a stubborn asshole and become too entrenched without realizing it.  The next time I feel like I'm facing an impossible issue with someone I care about, that is going to be one of the first things I take a serious look at.\n\n\nAs people had pointed out, she was telling me what she wanted (if not 100% direct, she was communicating it).  I also think she wasn't listening to me either - but there was enough there to align us back together to where now I'm very happy with us again.\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Just an update on where reddit helped uncover some of the issues I was dealing with and now I'm rounding out to a week of \"back to great\" with my GF - thanks Reddit!!!",

            "Good for you! Safewords are the key here - they retain the spirit of \"no means no\", but allow you and your girlfriend to explore feelings of desperate lovemaking without worrying about whether somebody is feeling uncomfortable. ",
            "I am so glad this worked out for you...well done. \n\nI don't want *anyone* to ogle me and objectify me and manhandle me: I want my *boyfriend* to do it. When he tells me I look hot and is kinda handsy when we're out and is beaming at me from across the room at a party, it makes me feel SO good and excited to get home and rip each others clothes off. \n\nLadies, men deserve this kinda treatment too (assuming they want it, of course)!",
            "Hooray! Glad this turned out so positively for both of you. The biggest breakthrough in communication my husband and I have had is realizing how stubborn we both are. It's a huge deal that you're thinking about that now!  Congratulations on everything from this Internet stranger. ",
            "this is such a positive update - well done to both of you for sorting your shit out!",
            "Congratulations. I've come across this issue myself in relationships and it goes back to how I was raised, you treat women with respect and also having two older sisters who pounded in my head that girls don't want to be looked at or spoken to except by a gentleman. \n\nOut in the real world having relationships with women who want to be ogled and taken and all that it can be difficult. Finding your way with the one you are with is the best thing. ",
            "Being a human being is so goddam complicated sometimes. This could have gone the other way so so easily, great job and congrats on the personal insight. I'm 35 and am guilty of thinking I know way more than I actually do, constantly.",
            "I read your first post. It bothers me how passive she is. Yes, it's fine now, but you need to probably have more common and frank conversations.",
            "> It bothers me how passive she is\n\nI, too, have trouble communicating my needs in a blunt way, especially to someone I love. I grew up in a household where if I raised an objection, love was withheld from me until I relented. That was bullshit, but it made me skilled at subtly stating needs. My husband has no trouble understanding \"Eh, maybe we can get tacos another night\" to mean \"I don't want tacos tonight.\" It's not that I'm incapable of stating a need, or that I don't know what I want. I just use more diplomatic words than \"EW TACOS.\"\n\n> She sounds insecure to the point of not being able to handle a relationship. He's doing most of the work it seems.\n\nCould be true. Then again, in my 6-year relationship with my husband, we've had periods where one or the other of us has had to perform most of the \"relationship work.\" When I was depressed because I couldn't find the job I wanted, he encouraged me and made money for the both of us. When he's upset about his job and has taken it out on my, I try to be patient and steer us through fights, trusting that this is him not at his best. Relationships aren't equal all the time.\n\n**As someone who's sexually aroused by submission and \"being taken,\" I thought it might be helpful to share my perspective-- I think it's a lot more complicated than someone being passive. I can't speak for all folks, nor am I part of any formal dom/sub community, but this is how it works for me. I hope others chime in.**\n\nIn my daily life, I'm an assertive person. I generally get what I want, or have ways of making it happen. I was raised to associate success with this behavior, and passivity with being weak and not worthy of love. Not surprisingly, I have some control and boundary issues-- I can be controlling, and I can push people away too quickly if they do something I don't like (preferring to shut them out rather than sort out a conflict).\n\nMaintaining these behaviors takes a lot of energy. When I assume a submissive role during sexytimes with my husband, I get to let all of that go. He dictates my pleasure-- what I feel, when he teases me, when I get off, etc. Giving up control is extremely cathartic. And sexy. After a while, I enter this brainspace where it's like I'm at the bottom of a warm sea, looking up, barely aware (and yet hyper aware?) of the physical pleasure I'm experiencing, and my husband's voice. He talks softly to me, often narrating what he's doing or about to do, or what I'm feeling. He reiterates how he's taking care of me and that I'm safe, and that I don't have to do anything but feel. It's so relaxing. I feel like I can stay in that space forever. Sometimes after I get off, it takes me a few minutes to  \"come back to reality\" and assume responsibility for my own body again. My husband usually cuddles me during that time. \n\nWe didn't start off this way; I think we'd been dating for over a year before we stumbled into this dynamic, and we've been refining it ever since. I knew I liked to be pushed up against walls, or to be on bottom, etc., but I'd never dated someone I loved and trusted as much as my husband, so it was never able to evolve to the point we're at now.\n\nIt works because we trust each other. I trust that he ultimately wants to make me feel good and would never hurt me, and he trusts that I'll tell him what's working and not working for me. I should clarify that we don't do very rough things-- it's more about light bondage and mind games-- but I think the principle is the same. To trust someone this much is incredibly fulfilling to me. In terms of my boundaries, I'm able to let someone in way farther than I'd usually tolerate, all while still feeling safe. I'm also able to authentically express my sexuality and needs, and have that be accepted (and encouraged!).\n\nAs for my husband, he's turned on by seeing me feel good, no matter the context. I've never put the issue to him, but also I suspect that he enjoys being a bit dominant, too. He's more passive in his daily life, to the point that it frustrates him, especially at work. I think his being dominant with me sexually reminds him that he *can* have his way and get what he wants. It's almost like he taps into this totally different personality-- one that I find devastatingly attractive.\n\nWe don't get into dominant/submissive play every time we have sex, either. It depends on our mood. But the dynamic is almost always present. \n\nTo me, OP sounds like he's off to a good start with communication and safewords. I'm sure there'll be stops and starts, but if you really love your partner, you're patient and hope to grow from it. \n\n",

You're left with no options and are forced to do something you're clearly not comfortable with, with no support from her. Then establish a safe word without any actual discussion of boundaries and went forward with it. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm glad this is working out for you right now, and I hope everything can continue to improve. Just the overall situation and how it ended up getting resolved seems... not really that healthy?",

Also you two need to have a discussion of each of your soft and hard boundaries.  Yes, including things you don't want to do to her ever.  It's okay for you to have limits as well.

        "selftext": "\nTL;DR: my boyfriend of almost 3 years told me a series of \u201cwhite lies\u201d that to me, seem more serious. Can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m overreacting or if this is actually indicative of a bigger problem.  \n\nI\u2019ll try to make this as short as possible but it\u2019s going to be long as hell because there is so much lying going on. My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 years, living together for 2. We have a pretty good relationship, obviously with ups and downs but we make it work and are happy. \n\nA little background on me/my boyfriend for context: \n\nI come from a single-parent home. My father was absent. My mother was/is by no means perfect, but she did her best with what she had. We were poor. Life was never easy for us but we had each other. Since I was pretty young, I\u2019ve wanted to pay her back someday. I\u2019ve worked incredibly hard to be able to do so. I help her financially as much as I can and regularly pay her bills/send her cash. I\u2019m also her only living child now as my brother passed away 5 years ago which basically left me to help her. I don\u2019t care, I love my mother, and the right thing to do is to help her when she needs it. But is is stressful. \n\nThis is relevant because my boyfriend described coming from a somewhat similar past, and it is something we have bonded over. Having the mutual experiences seemed to bring us closer. He told me he also helped his parents financially, and we would often vent to each other about the stress it brings. I am not one to confide in many people, so having someone who I felt like actually understood me, was meaningful to me. \n\n\nSo here is where the lies come in and I need someone to either tell me I\u2019m not crazy and this is fucked up, or that I am crazy and this isn\u2019t a huge deal. I\u2019m fine with either. \n\nWhen we met, my boyfriend lived in a condo in a pretty swanky part of the city (I live in the US northeast). He told me he owned that apartment/condo. I found this to be interesting/odd because he was 28 at the time and I know this property is upwards of $650,000 on the low end and he was in an entry-level job for only like 2 yrs so the numbers just didn\u2019t really add up. Whatever, maybe he\u2019s good at saving? \n\nBut then, since living together, I never once saw a piece of mail for a mortgage payment, electric bill, taxes, nothing. Not for 2 whole years. Very odd.\n\nAlso, when we started living together, he didn\u2019t have his room rented out in the former apartment yet so he was still responsible for that portion of the rent. He would send a Venmo payment to his mother on the first of every month for his portion. I don\u2019t own property, but I can\u2019t think of a scenario where I would Venmo my mother to pay the mortgage on a property I supposedly own. Getting more odd. \n\nHe would then go to his parents house for an afternoon and come back really upset. Usually when I would ask why, it was because they were having financial problems and he needed to help them out. I totally understood this and supported him. He literally has cried on my shoulder about this many times. \n\nHe tried to start a company years back and ended up getting into debt somehow. He told me this debt was $17,000 and that he paid it off. I\u2019m confused because I met him only 2-3 years after the supposed debt accrued/company dissolved and it was already paid off? He told me when he moved back home after the business failed, he was $17k in debt and living at his parents house working at a minimum wage job. How someone with a minimum wage job pays off that much debt in 3 years, I\u2019ll never know!\n\nWe got into a fight a few weeks ago and I finally had enough and confronted him about these things. Long story short - he doesn\u2019t help his parents, they actually pay his phone bill, and this was all a lie. He doesn\u2019t own that apartment, he didn\u2019t pay off that debt from his company (he initially told me his parents helped pay it off and then like 3 mins later \u201ccame clean\u201d and said that his business partner paid it off so I have literally no idea what the truth is there) and if anything, in my eyes, his parents are the ones who are financially supporting him.\n\nSo now, I\u2019m dating a 31 yr old man who doesn\u2019t pay his own phone bill, was lying to me and/or completely fabricating aspects of his life for 3 years, and then when confronted about it, continued to make up lies and then came clean about them 5 mins later. I\u2019m obviously concerned that he could lie for this long, about fundamentally important things like our values, and so on.\n\nI sincerely thought I would marry this man, he seemed to understand me like no one else and to be a truly caring and genuine person. Now I\u2019m having a hard time rationalizing actually planning a life around someone who would not only lie about their background and family etc. but also financial aspects. Aside from that, I now can\u2019t tell what is the truth and what is a lie. I\u2019ve also noticed other things he has lied about, called him out on it and he has denied it outright to my face. I see this as a form of gaslighting as I KNOW I\u2019m not wrong but he is trying to convince me otherwise.\n\nAm I overreacting? Is this a white lie that went haywire? Or is this actually a series of complete and utter bullshit used to manipulate me? And also, is it insane for me to actually consider a life with this man? Any advice is appreciated.",

            "My hard won advice would be to walk away because I predict/fear there are more lies.\nI got married to a woman who for the first 6 months of our rs made me believe that her best friend sometimes lived at her house when she was in between places. Her best friend turned out to be her ex who still lived in that house but would leave every weekend when I came over.\nHer reasoning for lying; she was scared I wouldn\u2019t date her if I knew she was living with her ex. Back then (I was 25/26), I truly wanted to believe in second chances and also tried to understand the lie, and I ended up marrying someone who lied about so many things, all the time, big and small, and justified cheating on me and treating me like crap all the time. It took me years to build trust with a partner after the divorce and I still don\u2019t really, am in therapy for it.\nThe thing about your partner lying; what he basically did was forge a connection out of something he knew would touch you in some way; my ex wife did the same thing. I was vegan, of course she was vegan. I was straight edge, of course she never drank either. I loved reading and poetry etc, of course she was into the exact same things. It seems like small things to lie about, but what happens is that you fall in love with someone that doesn\u2019t even exist. Who is your boyfriend when not the person he made you believe he was?\nSomeone financially not very responsible? Someone who you may not be attracted to in the long run because he determined what your core values are, realized he does not match up, thus created a persona you would like?\nWhat\u2019s more concerning, he lies, keeps lying and seems to show no remorse or deeper reflection on what prompted his behavior in the first place. I don\u2019t see him do much to earn your trust back at this point.\nI would put pause on this relationship, call it a break or whatever if you are not ready for a full on end just yet, and think about how this all effects you and how things could go forward from here. What would he need to do to prove he can be a trustworthy partner?\nI think he probably won\u2019t do much, and a pause or break will bring up more things that were not true, but I\u2019d also like to be wrong about this for your sake. \nFor now, I would seriously reconsider building anything serious with this man, and building your future around him. He is 32, not a teenager. If a grown man does not know at this age that lying like this is the worst base for a relationship,  it may be better to let him go. It might save you a world of (financial and emotional) trouble.",
            "None of these are 'white lies'. White lies are harmless lies that make social interactions go smoother. This is a man who's had no problems lying to you for three years about his financial situation, and who only came clean because you're not an idiot and realised the numbers didn't add up. If you hadn't questioned it, how long would he have kept lying to you? And you already *know* this isn't just a 'white lie that got out of control', you say in your post that he lies to your face about other things! So no, this isn't a small issue. You're dating a guy who literally lies to you all the time about everything, including things that really affect you and your future.

When I found out the truth, he later found a way to spin it into me being obsessed with his sexual history, when, in reality, I was obsessed with the fact this guy A) lied to me B) put my sexual health in danger. After our breakup, he actually rebounded to this SAME person (he shit-talked for years). I still tried to make things work with him after that because I loved him and I know everyone (including myself) makes mistakes.

Have you considered that he may actually be a compulsive liar?  It's natural for someone to fabricate a story when they feel like the truth will get them in trouble or bring about negative consequences - that's not to excuse that type of lying either, but self-preservation is understandable as a basic human instinct.  It's something else entirely to lie in situations where it doesn't seem to provide any discernible benefit.  \n\nYou're definitely not overreacting, BUT you're not insane to still consider a life with him.  It sounds like he's been incredibly supportive of you, and as someone who also has trouble opening up to people, it's a special thing to find someone you're that comfortable with.  On the flip side though, you want him to feel that same comfort in return.  I wouldn't ignore his lies or dismiss them as harmless because his deception was part of the reason you opened up to him in the first place, but I would insist on sitting down and having an honest conversation about WHY he felt the need to lie.  \n\nMaybe he felt embarrassed and wanted to downplay his financial dependence on his parents because he's comparing himself to you and feels inadequate when placed up against someone else his age who's managed to become self-sufficient to the point where she can also help support someone else when he isn't even fully supporting himself.   I think the \"why\" here is crucial.  I wouldn't just write him off.  We all make mistakes, but I would make him understand that your willingness to stay in this relationship is 100% contingent on his ability to be honest with you.",

It's built into their makeup. I think often it is nothing more than a really bad habit they have but they aren't people I want to be around. \n\nAnd with this guy it's more than just a really bad habit, because he used it to misrepresent himself to you and to manipulate you.

There\u2019s no good reason to do it either right now, except for trying to preserve this idea of what you thought your connection was. \n\nThe fact that he tried to cover up even in the midst of talking about it with you shows imo just how unready he is to be honest with himself and you.  He\u2019s heavily invested in his lies, and even if he intended to change for fear of losing you, it\u2019s not that easy.

Maybe he lied because he never loved someone as bad as you and he feared his financial situation would make you flee. When you start to lie, you can't get out, you need to stick with it. And that's what he did. I would not be so fast to say wether you need to get away from this man or not. \nIn the other hand, you need to have a serious conversation with him, about why he lied. If he doesn't answer, now that is a sign that he doesn't feel close to you and that he's not willing to (at least) apologize for all the lies, which is a more serious matter, I feel so.\n\nBeware of people that tells you that lying is a straight \"no no\". Life is always more complicated than that. Everyone has a reason to do anything. To figure out your next move you need to hear this reason and ask yourself what you feel about it, regarding values, how you were raised, how you developed as a person. If the reason could not have had a place in your moral and social way of thinking, or if you can understand his behavior but he should have come and tell you sooner, what you will decide in the end tells more about yourself than it will about him.

            "As others have said, none of these things are white lies. White lies are like telling someone the food they made is good because you don't want to hurt their feelings. This is either compulsive lying or pathological lying. It sounds likely you don't even know this person at all because if he lied about all that what else has he lied about? Something very similar happened to me, but I didn't find out the extent of it till after I broke up with him. In my situation he said he had similar traumatic experiences growing up. Turns out that's not true at all. I'm slowly unraveling all the lies and finding out that likely less than 5% of what he told me is true. His ex-wife contacted me after I broke up with him and all the things she's told me that she knows about him have revealed all the lies. I had some suspicions while in the relationship, but he would just lie more or refuse to answer my questions. But I never guessed the massive extent of the lies. It's really scary to find out this person you thought you knew lied about almost everything. The thing is these type of people usually don't change. My ex lied to and gaslit his ex-wife all the time, had other relationships before he met me, and continued to do those things. Actually he got worse between her and me. It seems he lied very little about his past to her. His lies with her were about everyday life and such. I also had a friend who dated a guy for awhile and found out he lied about his entire life including what he did day to day. He lied to everyone about everything constantly. He was so good at lying she only found out by complete accident. My advice would be to get out. People like this seem to lie about everything and they're often good at it and get better at it over time. I just don't see how you could be with someone when you'll never know what's the actual truth. Trust is important in a relationship and you'd never be able to trust him after finding out he's a major liar. Also in my experience, when they lie about everything you realize you don't know who they are at all. The person you thought you knew turns out to be a complete facade. I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's really horrific and awful finding out the person you thought you knew is really a stranger who lied all the time.",

This is a deal breaker for any long term relationship unless he really turns over a new leaf on honesty.  \n\nOne of the biggest reasons for divorce is money.  Whether the couple doesn't agree on finances or saving/budget OR someone deliberately lied or concealed their financial state, opening their unsuspecting partner up to liability.\n\nYou aren't even married and he's been lying to you from day one about his finances.  It'd be one thing if it was a hobby of his (like he made three tables with his woodworking habit rather than two or four), but this is HUGE.  $17,000 dollars of debt and he tells you it's already taken care of?  Imagine if he had gotten into $30,000 in debt, hid the debt and the reason why, on a credit card he took out with both of your names on it if you got married!  (For the record, this happened to a friend of mine.  She found out about it only because she opened the wrong drawer in his desk, trying to find the wedding \"thank you\" cards he claimed he finished.  He didn't finish the cards.  He also secretly got a credit card in both their names and racked up $30,000 in debt buying Warhammer figurines that he planned to build, paint, then sell).\n\nI think the more insulting part of this is that he lied and the lie isn't even a good one.  If he's acting this way before your finances were joined and when he might have MORE reasons to cover his ass (i.e.: \"Oh, if she finds out, she'll divorce me.\"  \"I don't want her to be mad that I can't actually afford a car so I'll take out a secret loan and not tell her.  It'll work out.\"), then I would be concerned what he'd do once the stakes are higher.  \n\nWhy did you not confront him on this sooner?  Did you believe he would just lie more or did you just like him so much that you didn't want to face the fact that he was lying?   \n\nYes, I think the fact he lied about such a big thing is a bigger deal than you're making it, especially with how many marriages collapse over financial issues.

They will assume that you're lying just as freely, projecting their own bad behaviour onto you. This makes problem resolution in long-term relationships impossible, and you'll find yourself accused of random things which is infuriating at best. By way of example, my ex used this logic to avoid helping me, even after surgery, assuming I was exaggerating my pain. If you have kids, he'll lie to them and hurt them as a result.

It\u2019s wrong that he lied to you about all that stuff but it seems the fact that he hid that all from you could be he didn\u2019t want people to know he came from a wealthy background. I hear all the time of kids coming from wealthy backgrounds pretending their middle class or lower so they won\u2019t be used by others.

            "These aren't white lies, these are screaming red flags. A white like is something like, \"Your new hairdo looks great on you,\" when no it doesn't or \"I didn't hear the phone in the other room, sorry,\" when they totally did but didn't want to put down their game to go answer it. What you have bluntly put, is a pathological liar. And a financially irresponsible one still dependent on his parents, who hid that from you and is likely going to expect you to foot the bill for everything when you all get married IF you are foolish enough to go ahead and do so. \n\nSeriously, does this guy even work? Does he pay bills on anything? \n\nAnd yes, if he lies to you about those things oh hell yeah, he is so going to lie to you about everything else. You've caught him in other lies too, not just the financial one. That's why I say pathological. Most people if they start out on a whopper like he did will break down sooner than later, confess all and not lie about anything else. What you detail is someone who was able to compartmentalize and keep the lies going to get you to build a level of affinity and trust over \"shared backgrounds\" that is to the point of being frightening.\n\nIt would be a dealbreaker for me. Trust is everything in a relationship and something like this? Yeah, I don't see any amount of therapy being able to fix this. You  really are going to have to decide if you'd be happier sticking your head in the sand and pretending he isn't lying whenever his lips are moving or to leave him and find a normal person, because what you detail isn't normal.

Ask him to come completely clean to start fresh and ask him to be 100% honest. \n\nIf even then it turns into lies red flag. \n\nBut to be fair I can see how a man would tell a white lie that then gets out of hand and it seems his intentions for lying were good. To bond AND embarrassment.",
            "I think you need to have a think into his *intent* for the lying. I don't think he was trying to \"mess\" with you, \"hurt\" you or be a shit person.. It honestly sounds like you're a pretty stand-alone person when it comes to money, and are pretty proud.. It sounds like he's intimidated and has his own shortcomings about his own situation and can't own it, therefore lies about it to make it seem better. I think he's really just embarrassed and insecure and that's something he needs to sort out personally (outside of your relationship) before you two could move forward (if you would want to in a continuing honest way). As it sounds to me like you always had an inkling about this stuff, but maybe didn't push the trigger on asking him about it - as maybe your subconscious didn't want to make him feel embarrassed. Once you know he's working on his insecurities, you'll be able to move forward in a more honest way. Wish you the best.",

It helped me get from the sad and confused stage to the angry stage. The final straw was finding *his* post he made about half a year ago, talking about breaking up with me when I was in a very hurt and vulnerable state. \n\nI then spent two nights at my sister's place to clear my head and told her about everything and she was shocked and disgusted and we talked for hours and it was all really freeing. I then decided to break it off with Jack. Jack and I lived together but the apartment was rented in his name, and I just always gave him my half of the rent. So I hired a moving truck and got all my important stuff when he was at work yesterday and left a note that said: Congratulations. Our relationship is now ~~open~~ over. I felt bad for not having the courage to tell him face to face but honestly, I just didn't even want to face him even for one minute. \n\nHe kept calling me non-stop yesterday and leaving lots of messages, some of them saying how much he misses me and loves me, some of them saying how glad he is that it's over and how he has been cheating on me for the past year. No idea if that's true. I'm staying at my sister's for now and looking for a new apartment. I'm still sad and angry but thinking about Jack coming home to a half empty apartment (without a bed, that one was mine) makes me smile.

            "Good choice.\n\nI have a bit of experience with open and poly relationships.\n\nPeople have wants and needs. Relationships also have their own needs.\n\nViewing multiple relationships as a way to fulfill personal wants and needs is dangerous territory. I'm not saying every want and need has to be filled by every relationship, but if you can't be happy in one relationship without adding more to fill in the gaps, that relationship isn't going to work well.\n\nFurthermore, treating people as need fulfillment machines is shitty to other parties. Expecting to get oral from a partner without contributing to any of their desires is selfish and objectifying. Let's be real, very few people want to be a blowjob hookup side piece with nothing in return.\n\nThis guy didn't give a shit about your feelings, and didn't care enough to think about potential other party feelings either.\n\nHe's not a catch. He may be able to manipulate his way into getting what he wants, but until he fixes his issues, he's not going to have healthy, mutually fulfilling relationships.",

Please put thoughts of relationships with guys out of your head for now and focus on building a better relationship with you. Work on your own self esteem so you will never be in that position again. \n\nI speak as someone who stayed in unhealthy relationships for way too long, finally going into an acute depression when I got dumped by someone I should not have been with anyway, who criticised me frequently (as well as being lovely at other times), was very angry and controlling. (I later came to see I'd been emotionally controlling too in manipulative/passive-aggressive ways - no blame here! We were both immature and unhealthy.) \n\nI finally realised how damaged my self esteem was, tho' I thought of myself as confident, and did a *lot* of work on that. I changed my life completely, am in a healthy, 4-year relationship based on mutual respect, honesty and trust and I can't really believe some of the unhealthy behaviours I used to display/be on the receiving end of in my younger relationships. Needing to be loved by someone else and the fear of not being loved by someone else is a projection of a lack of love for yourself. Putting up with being disrespected (or worse, abused) and trying to please others/prove your worth to them is a projection of a lack of respect and liking for yourself. We're all flawed, and we're all loveable anyway! :) Also, what I'm describing is so very common, unfortunately. I'm a life coach now (and a trainer in confidence/assertiveness) and most people have some level of self esteem issues that they're either working on or have yet to discover. Childhood f***s you up in myriad subtle ways, even if you're one of the luckier ones. :) But as soon as we become aware of unhealthy beliefs and mindsets we can start changing them - there's hope for us all!\n\nBe proud of yourself for standing up for yourself, going to someone who respects you for support (lots of that, please!) and standing on your own two feet. Keep that going and keep working on loving and respecting yourself more and your next relationship will be infinitely better - and you'll appreciate it all the more for what you learned from this one.

I am thankful that my boss is giving me 2 days off to recover and get back on my feet. Forty-eight hours after the breakup, I talked to my roommate and she said that while she understands how I feel, she will continue hanging out with him. I also talked to my ex and told him how uncomfortable I feel about the whole thing. He also said he understands, but thinks it's controlling of me to ask them not to hang out. Last week, they hung out for 5 days, for hours on end. They did respect my requests not to come inside the house when together, which I appreciate. \n\nMany posters suggested that they were having an affair. My ex claims that he did not break up with me to get with her. I did believe him at first, and maybe it was somewhat true, but I now think that something is going on and was going on. I found out that my roommate had a crush on my ex, while were were dating, yet still continued to hang out with him alone (while we were dating). I asked my ex while we were still dating if we could hang out just the two of us a little bit more, and I was accused then of being jealous and controlling. Turns out I was onto something. I suspect they are now trying to hide their relationship from me, though I cannot be sure.\n\nTwo days ago, I told my roommate that I no longer think it is healthy for me to live with her. She was fine with this and is asking around for places to stay. I will also consider leaving if she cannot leave. The most crushing thing about all this is that the two of them were people I considered best friends. This is also happening LESS THAN 2 weeks after the break up. It feels weird and rude to me. Of course they are within their rights to do whatever, but I feel like I was betrayed, even before the relationship ended. Maybe in time I'll be happy for them. \n\nTLDR; Ex and roommate hanging out still, I suspect something is going on and now they're hiding it from me.\n\n\nEdit: you all are so kind! Thanks for the words of encouragement, tough love, and shared experiences. I am staying with a friend tonight and am hoping that the move-out situation goes smoothly. Living apart from my current roommate is the only viable option for me, moving forward. I will also be cutting contact from both of them as soon as the living situation is settled. \n\nI am going to therapy tomorrow, and went last week, so I\u2019m hoping that helps. I am so thankful I have off from work. It\u2019s been nice to just be able to rest.\n\nEdit 2: roommate confirmed in a convo today that they are \u201cmore than friends.\u201d",

            "Sorry for your break up and how they are both treating you.  As soon as you can, go no contact with them.   This will help you to heal and move on with your life.",
            "I usually am not a fan of the people around this sub who's initial reaction to any relationship issue is to come and scream \"Divorce! Cheating! Dump him/her and do you!!\" Unfortunately, it's sounding like those people were right, after reading your last post I was with you that it seemed like things were innocent and nothing nefarious was going on. It sounds like while there may not have been physical intimacy between them, there was an emotional connection between them because you were right in your first post also, dumping someone generally means that you're also dumping their friends too. Them hanging out for hours on end day after day is not the \"friend of ex and ex behavior\", it is budding relationship behavior. In the end, hopefully, the roommate split goes quickly and cleanly and you can rid yourselves of these negative contributors. Good luck OP",
            "Everyone likes to think of their self as the hero of their story. Currently your roommate and EX are playing out their fantasy of being lovers against all odds. You\u2019re now the villain in their \u201cepic love story\u201d merely by advocating for your own needs.\n\nMoving out and leaving them behind is your best move. Do that.",
            "I've been there. My ex and best friend of 11 years decided they wanted to be together 2 weeks after we broke up. I tried to remain her friend, but alas, they are now married and we no longer speak. Maybe a sporadic text here or there, but I wouldn't consider us friends any more. Hang in there. It does get better.",
            "Block them on everything and try to move on with your life. If he did cheat on you, then he is untrustworthy and know it will probably always be in the back of her mind. As for the roommate, she obviously showed her true colors even if they didn't cheat- by being a terrible friend! They aren't worth your time. You deserve better.",
            "They both sound like world-class gaslighters. Save yourself the mental anguish,  remove yourself from this situation, and leave them to each other. What comes around will definitely go around.",
            "Sorry, this must be pretty hard to deal with.\n\n\nI really hope your roommate does the right thing and moves out, she has disrupted your life enough and she should be the one leaving and fast. \n\n\nIf they are in fact seeing each other, they could have at least kept it on the down low for a while longer. It sounds like they were completely inconsiderate and selfish.",
            "I'm sorry, OP. I was in a similar situation once, except we dated for almost 5 years and lived together. He was an aquaintance that slowly worked his way in under the guise of befriending me. Their attraction was obvious but she denied it to the very end. \n\nTwo weeks after she'd broken up with me AND I MOVED IN WITH HIM, I found out through a mutual friend they were already secretly dating. It destroyed me for years.\n\nMy advise, like everyone else's, is to cut them out. But I would also add letting them go emotionally as well. 'Forgive' might be too strong of a word, but see if you can completely detach them from strong emotions, as if you were thinking of a random old aquaintance from school. Time heals all wounds.",
            "It feels weird and rude to you because it IS weird and rude!! I would say one of you needs to move ASAP so that you can move on. I\u2019d also suggesting going no contact with the both of them, they obviously did not value your friendship the way you did theirs.",
            "I remember your first post, especially when you said that the 2 of them were more athletic than you and that they hung out together solo without him telling you. \n\n\nHonestly, it sounds like they were cheating together and are now dating. That fucking sucks but the upside is that it's easier to get over someone who pulled such an asshole piece of shit move than it is to get over someone who is basically decent but you're just not compatible. \n\n\nIt's going to hurt, but keep reminding yourself that they're simply not worth grieving for. They both betrayed you, and in so doing betrayed who they really are. You've rid yourself of 2 people who were ultimately untrustworthy, and would have been toxic to keep in your life.\n\n\nSorry you're going through this. it's going to suck for a while but keep reminding yourself - you're only losing them because they suck, not because you suck. You're only losing them because they are traitors, not because you are a traitor. You're only losing them because they proved they don't deserve you, not because you proved you don't deserve them. \n\n\nOther than that, standard break up advice applies (ie more time with friends/family, work out, focus on hobbies/career/projects etc). Best of luck",
            "i mightve missed this op, but why did he break up with you out of nowhere? what did he say his reasoning was? Frankly, i like to think people can be that cruel, but i do think they may be hiding a potential relationship from you. if they are hanging out for 5 days straight for hours and hours, it's safe to assume that they have something going on as i imagine they probably have other friends and family they couldve spent time with but instead chose each other. i think you are doing the right thing by asking her to move out. break ups are tough, but at the end of the day, we grow from them",
            "The way you feel is normal. You did the right thing speaking with your roommate.\n\nHopefully she will soon find somewhere else and you can take time to heal and decide wether you want to keep the friendship or not.\n\nIf you do want to keep friends with your roommate perhaps you cold offer to help her look for a flat? It can be hard.\n\nI would suggest for you to start looking for places for yourself just in case your friend does not follow through.",
            "It's like she is trying to escape because living with you means she would have to face her wrongs. Otherwise, why would she have a reason to actually leave the apartment ??\n\nSorry you were done so dirty.",
            "\"I was accused then of being jealous and controlling\"  \n\n\nThe boyfriend doth protest too much, methinks. You were asking for more one-on-one time with him and that was his reaction? Oy. It sounds like they both have some serious soul-searching to do regarding how they treat others. I'm sorry you were the recipient of some pretty terrible behavior from folks who were supposed to be your friends.  \n\n\nAnd yes, I just made that \"doth protest too much\" line up all on my own.  \n\n\nSigned,  \n\n\nevil\\_mike Shakespeare",
            "They're fucking. Sorry girl. He out of the blue dumped you and has been hanging with your roommate? Fishy af. Move out if you can.",
            "My ex moved in with a close friend and even though I had moved away and he had no interest, shit stung. He even kept in touch telling me how lucky I was to have left her and how he was desperate for a roommate but it's still kinda crap. Out of sight out of mind is the best way to do it.",
            "They are the ones who will lose out here. What kind of BF does that to his S/O? A piss-poor one. And chances are, this is a pattern of his, so it's not if he does the same to her, just when. And what kind of friend does that at all? A fake ass one. I don't know, but for me, regardless of how close I am to a friend, their exes are almost extensively off-limits, and if something does start to happen I'll get their explicit go-ahead before anything happens well after they've broken up and quite some time has passed.  \n\n\nI know it hurts now, but count this as a blessing, you dodged two major bullets. This is where you get to lift up your head, be the bigger person and say \"Screw 'em\", cause you deserve better. You deserve to be happy. And most of all you deserve honesty. Don't ever let these two back in your circle, you deserve so much more than what they offered. I know this doesn't make it easier, but it was their faults that caused this, not your own, so please do not blame yourself. They are the ones 100% to blame here, and the hell with them, if they want to be that kind of person, then they can go be that type of person alone without dragging you down. Find someone deserving of your love, both friend and lover alike.   \n\n\nMoving may be the best option, and if you are able to be the one to do so, it might do best so the scenery changes and old memories don't just keep popping up. Get a fresh start, go be you, the best you that you can, and enjoy your life. Misery loves company, and those two miserable wrecks deserve each other and the pain they'll bring to one another. You deserve honesty and integrity.",
            "No advice but have been in a similar  situation and wanted to say you will feel shitty and betrayed for a while and then it will fade (as you no doubt know). In my situation I wondered a little if the relationship flourished because it was taboo and gave them a thrill. It certainly didn\u2019t last long afterward. Not that you should spend time figuring it out! A clean break will be much better for you, even if you want to know. \n\nJust wanted you to know someone else out there can kind of understand what you\u2019re feeling.",
            "To be blunt, the people you are hanging out with will vanish by the time you are 36.  They seem valuable to you right now, but they aren't.",
            "I feel your pain! This exact situation happened to me a few years ago and you are totally justified in the way you feel! The best thing you can do is leave and cut contact with them as everyone has said, good friends don\u2019t do this type of thing so your doing yourself a favour by cutting these toxic people out of your life.  I know it hurts now that you lose your boyfriend and your friend but you don\u2019t want to drag this out for yourself. The best thing to come out of the situation for me was that now I always trust my instincts with people, and don\u2019t allow myself to be gaslit, if I think someone is flirting with my boyfriend or the other way around I\u2019m gonna trust my gut, and we shouldn\u2019t accept this behaviour from anybody.",
            "I'm so glad you and the roommate will cease living together.  This is one of those situations where you are absolutely justified in feeling betrayed and hurt and angry, even if they are not technically in the wrong, but you 100% need some distance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy further advice: Don't try to be friends with either of them.  That doesn't mean nurse a grudge, or try to stop mutual friends from liking them.  It doesn't even mean avoiding seeing them if they are going to be somewhere you want to go.  But it does mean that in my experience, it is trying to put the cart before the horse to assume that you will be friends with your ex or your ex's new girlfriend someday.  Maybe you will.  Maybe I will strike up a friendship with a celebrity someday.  But I ought not to count on it, or go out of my way to try to make it happen, and neither should you.  You had defined, formal relationships with both of these people: boyfriend, roommate.  It is likely that, absent those defined relationships, plus the baggage of this break-up, you'll never have a close friendship with either of these people.  That is one of the things you mourn during a break-up. It hurts, but it generally hurts more to try for a friendship that isn't actually there.\n\nBest of luck.  Time really is the only thing for it, as much as that sucks.",
            "It was very clear from the first post you made that your ex broke up with you to date your roommate - you can pretty much disregard anything they say to you about the matter.\n\nThis is unfortunately something that is relatively common and will be very painful for you to sit through. \n\nThe fact that your roommate was willing to bounce so quickly says it all. They will be official before you know it. To minimize pain, you should part ways and block all contact with these two as quickly as possible - if you don't do this, it's gonna hurt even more. Sorry this happened to you.",
            "Not to be the kind of person that relishes in someone else's misfortune, but maybe it makes you feel better to know that your roommate is going to get dropped abruptly for the newer model too.  I don't understand people that get into relationships in this manner and expect different results.  Especially if this cheater (emotional at the least) and gaslighter (you call him out and he called you controlling) took no time at all to work on himself.",
            "Nah they are terrible people. If they were your friends they wouldnt  date each other without your consent and they certainly wouldn't do this in just two weeks. Anyone who thinks that's insane, let me ask you, what do you think the bro code is? It's respect for you homie and if you are unsure then you must ask. You also must respect the decision they give. No one considered how awkward it would be for OP either. Find better friends. Don't feel bad though. We all had to do it at some point.",
            "I just read both your posts and feel so gross. What nasty shameless manipulative selfish people they both are. You were clearly the only decent person in that relationship and unfortunately two scummy people you thought were also decent found each other. Honestly, they belong together from the sounds of it and you have dodged not one but two bullets. \n\nSeriously though, take care of yourself and don't let these people walk all over you anymore. Work your way through these feelings (which you're already doing by posting here), practice some good ol' self care and in time these feelings of hurt and betrayal will slowly fade until you can laugh about it one day.",
            "Similar situation. I'm (28M) and my \"best friend\" (27F) for over ten years decided it was totally okay to hang out with my ex (24F) because it's \"hard for her to find female friends\". This is after my ex was talking to other men and hanging out with them behind my back, lied about having an STD, and was pretty much emotionally abusing me (one actual friend even said she was gaslighting me) the entire time. It hurt so much to not only lose a partner, but my best friend. But I distanced myself heavily from my so called best friend and have been focusing on me. Life is so much better without all the drama. It's been over a year and I do not GAF anymore. Hurt a lot, therapy helped me move on from that chapter. It's gonna keep bothering you until you realize you cannot control this. I know it's hard but you need yourself right now. Try to reconnect with old friends and if you have family try hanging out with them. Good luck",
            "My best friend of 11 years married my abusive ex. So yeah. It's a shit situation. Ruined our friendship and though 6ish years later we've somewhat rekindled our friendship, I will never be at a point where I feel totally comfortable with the situation. She did not and still does not understand that what they did was shitty. Granted, he and I had been broken up for a while at that point but I introduced them. Furthermore, she knew all the nitty gritty about our super toxic relationship and still pursued him, which just felt like betrayal. From what I can tell they are happy and I am happy in my own relationship with my SO but it took me a while to stop being pissed.",

            "Wow they\u2019re assholes. What a selfish, cruel way to treat someone they consider a friend. \n\nSure they\u2019re both single and can do what they want, but there are consequences to every choice. And the choices they\u2019ve been making are directly causing you emotional distress. They know this and are making those choices anyway. \n\nMy heart goes out to you. Hoping better things come your way soon and that the karma monster gets them.",
            "This exact same thing happened to me and guess what? They were sleeping together for MONTHS prior to him breaking up with me and continued sleeping together after we broke up. She is not your friend...and he is trash. Get out of there and never speak to either of them again.",

Etc.\n\nI really think she should have to leave and I think you should start looking for a new roommate. Maybe give her a date that she needs to be out by because someone else is moving in. Obviously that also depends on legalities of lease agreements which is why I asked. \n\nThey did a super shitty thing. You didn\u2019t deserve this. Hold your head high and don\u2019t give them the satisfaction of seeing you upset or emotional. Make her feel ashamed to be in the apartment because you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Hopefully she leaves without incident and her guilt pushes her out sooner rather than later. I\u2019m sorry you had to go through this.",
            "Seems you\u2019re doing all the right things for yourself in creating distance between you and them. That\u2019s the healthiest thing you can do.\n\nAlso, as someone who went through a similar situation last year, the ex jumping to one of my graduate program friends, a thing to keep in mind going forward is that neither of you owe the other anything. Meaning, they\u2019re entitled to do what they like with whoever they like.\n\nIt\u2019s a hard way of looking at things, but once I saw things from that perspective, which IS NOT EASY, it made moving on a lot more manageable. \n\nWhat you outta consider doing now is to create an environment for yourself that stimulates your soul and occupies your time. You\u2019re still grieving, being mindful is incredibly important at this stage, but also get out so that you\u2019re not dwelling. \n\nIt\u2019ll be slow, it\u2019ll be tough, but with the right amount of distance, you\u2019ll come out of this better for the experience in a few months or more. \n\nBless.",

            "OP this totally sucks and probably hurts so incredibly much right now. \n\nI was in a similar position where a guy I was seeing ended up dating my best friend quite quickly after we ended. I was devastated and felt betrayed by both of them, her especially. I was convinced they wouldn't last and that made me feel better for a time. We tried to maintain a friendship (I had moved cities which made it easier to cope with) but eventually we slowly stopped trying. We still have friends in common and follow each other on social media. \n\nThree and half years later, they are engaged and I genuinely am happy for them. I've healed in the past three years and no longer feel any anger or animosity towards either of them. My dad and a close friend died during this time and for me, it made me realise you need to find happiness where you can and I no longer begrudge them that. Obviously I don't think you should shit on others to get where you want though but I understand why they did it now. \n\nI just wanted to share my experience with you so you know that there is light at the end of the tunnel.

Only for it to go to shit when one of my closest friends started crushing on a friend of ours boyfriend.\nThe other girl moved far, far away but I know they're still in contact and it made their relationship hell.\n\nNote to self: Keep your relationship dynamic between you and your S.O, don't turn it into a trio friendship that will eventually snowball into something more.

Also I think you're doing a great job by going to therapy right away, please do not turn to drinking or reckless behavior as an outlet, it feels so good in the short term but stunts your growth. If you're feeling anger/resentment try to use that to better yourself in this situation, I think it has the potential to power so much positivity.   \n\n\nLastly, you'll not only get through this, you'll come out better on the other side.

            "Ohmygosh this exact same thing happened to me a few years ago! I\u2019m sorry they\u2019re putting you in that position, it\u2019s unfair and disrespectful of them. It sucks now, but it will be so much better after you distance yourself from them. You\u2019re handling it well btw!",
            ">I found out that my roommate had a crush on my ex, while were were dating, yet still continued to hang out with him alone (while we were dating). I asked my ex while we were still dating if we could hang out just the two of us a little bit more, and I was accused then of being jealous and controlling. \n\nUgh. I am so sorry.\n\n>Of course they are within their rights to do whatever, but I feel like I was betrayed, even before the relationship ended. \n\nYou were betrayed. I'm happy that you're pursuing therapy because to have this happen from the people you trusted most is absolutely a horrific thing to endure. Going no contact with both of them is also absolutely necessary for you to begin healing from this. I hate that this is what happened to you. Best of luck. I hope you update us again in the future about what your life is like after moving on and healing from this.",
            "I am sorry, this sucks. Some words of advice straight from my mom's mouth - You are your own best friend and you should never place 100% trust into any human being. These are two people you have known less than a year and it certainly not be assumed that you can fully trust them to put your needs and wants in front of their own. 7-12 months is enough time to feel comfortable, but not enough time to truly know a person. Now you know who they are a lot better. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile I am by no means saying you should never hang out with friends and your mate in a group setting, you are treading on dangerous territory by bringing two people you don't know 100% into a close, tight-knit relationship. I have never hung out with my husband's friends without him there, and I don't have their phone numbers in my phone, vice versa. They are nice guys and I enjoy chatting them up socially, but they are his friends and it is just better keeping an arms-length between us. The same goes with my friends.  Just take this as a lesson learned about how shitty people are shitty. Not your fault, but certainly something that should register.",

You have my complete respect for how you have handled this situation, I myself remember the sting of my ex cheating on me with a \u201cfriend\u201d, it was awful. Even if there wasn\u2019t any cheating I know it probably still feels like there was. This situation still just feels sleazy. I\u2019m so sorry.

            "Similar thing happened to my daughter, except they weren't living together,  and her boyfriend played the \" I think I'm gay\" card so he could break up with her and not let her focus on this \"friend\" he had been hanging out with.",
            "You are totally within your rights to feel this way. You are also better off without these two, because clearly neither of them care about how painful and uncomfortable this is for you. They do not have to date each other. They could easily find other people to date (and from what you\u2019ve said, I\u2019m convinced they are dating).\n\nForget them and move on. I hope she moves her ass out soon. You shouldn\u2019t have to go through all that right now.",
            "Seems pretty sketchy on their end but even if everything they have been telling you is true and there wasn't anything going on the fact of the matter is they don't respect you otherwise they wouldn't be doing this. You need to remove them from your life.",
            "I know I'm late to the party but this is so similar to what I went through. Spoiler Alert: it didn't turn out well. I hope you can find peace in letting this \"friend\" go. I'm sorry that you're being betrayed by the people you loved the most. It's definitely one of the most painful things to go through. \n\nAll I have to offer is that life is much less painful/drama free once you lower your tolerance level for bullshit. This behavior is unacceptable but rest assured, there are good and genuine people out there. You will love again. You will make true friends and life will be beautiful again.",
            "I have had a similar situation before where, in fact, my old roomie was the one initiating multiple hang outs with my ex, who she had only met through me and hadn't previously been very close to. \n\nAt the time, I would have loved to still have either of them in my life, but it clearly became unhealthy for everyone involved. They never hung out at my house either, but I ended up moving out.\n\nI legitimately don't think they had an affair, but why would a close friend initiate hanging out with my ex right after we had broken up? They had never hung out one-on-one before.",
            "Damn, that sucks, I'm sorry.   \n\n\nIt definitely sounds like there were feelings and attraction at least between roommate and ex while you were dating, even if no cheating took place.   \n\n\nIt sucks to find out this way about people you trusted, but for them t pull this is pretty shitty and you deserve better people in your life. At least you fund that out before more time and energy was invested in either of them.",

It will be hard and it\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to feel but don\u2019t dwell on the specifics. If they are or aren\u2019t having an affair, two toxic people who don\u2019t care about you are out of your life. It\u2019s better you see this now rather than later.",
            "I\u2019m so sorry that this happened to you. They both sound awful. The petty-ness in new would suggest telling all your mutual friends about how disrespectful your roommate is in all this... but... maybe you\u2019re not as petty as I\u2019d be. \nBut to be fair telling everyone about this is just also giving everyone a heads up about how much of a snake she is so \n\nHonestly I\u2019d be more mad at my roommate bc if that was supposed to be my best friend idk man I\u2019d lose it lol. \nGood for you for staying strong and keeping your head up.",
            "I'm sorry you're having to deal with this, and your roommate doesn't sound like a friend to you at all. \n\nI agree that it wouldn't be healthy to remain roommates, but I'd even go a step further and try to find new friends who won't treat you like this. It was perfectly reasonable of you to not want your friend/roommate to be friends with your boyfriend and for you to be able to spend time alone with him without the friend tagging along constantly. Both your boyfriend and this friend should have respected your relationship boundaries.",
            "Nothing to add here, but you\u2019re strong and amazing and they deserve each other. The fact that she was so ready to let you move out means that she didn\u2019t consider you a friend in the first place. Their friends will soon come to learn of their toxicity and they\u2019ll find people just like them. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019ll be fine.",
            "I am so happy you are working on your situation, and just remember, this has nothing to do with you. Don\u2019t ever for a second blame yourself for this. I CANT wait for karma to hit them both. I hope they get to enjoy of life of misery. Together or not.",
            "This whole situation stinks, if he is infact hooking up with her and had to dump you before he did so, that sounds like the right thing for him to do, but hiding it and calling you controlling is terrible gaslighting behaviour, same goes for your roommate if they are getting together then she is a backstabber who cannot be trusted and not someone you want as a friend anyway, consider this situation from your future, if you didn't end up getting hurt now you would've not known that you shouldn't be friends with either of them.",
            "Take this time to really focus on growing strong and healthy friendships. Don't put all your eggs in one basket - cultivate friendships with many people that you share your various hobbies with :) I'm sorry these people feel like they can treat someone this way, but you are blessed with the time and energy to yourself that you can channel into bringing more positivity in your life.",
            "They were fucking well before he dumped you, you know this is true, maybe you don't want to believe it, but you should admit that you know it is true, it will make it easier to move on when reminding yourself what a scumbag he is. You dodged a bullet because it's only a matter of time before he cheats on your roommate too.",

But on the bright side, you don\u2019t have to waste any more time being blinded by their actions towards you. They are selfish and disgusting for belittling your feelings despite the relationship they had with you. \n\nIt\u2019s really hard to accept something that seems unreal in these situations. Stay strong!",
            "I\u2019m so sorry! I\u2019ve been there before where my best friend started dating my ex.. only I later found out that there was much flirting going on while I was still with him.. I tried staying friends with both of them but couldn\u2019t handle it and cut them out\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going thru this.. she is a shitty friend but you will be okay!",

            "I'm so sorry :( I feel this whole thing has been so disrespectful to you from both your ex and roommate. Unfortunately I know this feeling all too well and I find it so painful and nauseating. I wish you all the healing you need and fantastic new friends and loves! And mind you, you don't have to be happy for those two, it's perfectly normal to feel angry and betrayed in a situation like this. Good luck <3",
            "You have been betrayed. It is not surprising that you are devastated by this situation and your ex and roommate don't have any right to tell you how to grieve the loss of their trust and friendship. Equally, people cannot help who they fall in love with, and they do seem to be well suited. The best ending is simply a respectful and clean break, in so far as that is possible. I am glad that your personal space is being respected, they certainly should not be seeing each other in your home.",
            "If your roommate has one shred of decency she will come out of the lust fog feeling ashamed and stupid for what she did. But since she doesn't seem to have any decency, maybe someone worse than her will give her some justice.",
            "My ex and mutual friend did the same to me, but it was a relief because in the end they were wayyy more compatible with each other than she and I ever were. It bothered me she put up pics of them making out like a week after the break up...but eh soon thereafter I was kinda happy they found each other and I found my way out? It was a relief all in all.",
            "this happened to me a few years ago and it turned out my best friend and ex were seeing eachother behind my back while we were still together and started dating 2 days after we broke up. they\u2019re still together and i have a lot of resentment for both. i\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this nobody deserves that",
            "I know it\u2019s easier said than done but try to not get yourself too worked up about this. Things sting because you still care for and maybe still want your ex. But he\u2019s doing too a favor by no stringing you along. My ex husband is now married to one of my best friends and while I\u2019m sure our situations are totally different, in the end all I want is for people I care about to be happy.  \nMy ex and friend were super weird about my finding out they were together, but that\u2019s to be expected, I would have been weird about it too if I was in their shoes. But if someone doesn\u2019t want to be with you, the best thing they can do for you is let you go. You can rest easy knowing you were right, but for the love of god please don\u2019t let either of them gaslight you because they can\u2019t just answer truthfully when confronted with the information they assume will hurt you. It\u2019s the withholding of that information that causes the most pain and stress.",
            "You are like Neo out here dodging bullets but you cannot see it because you are in the thick of it RN. You jumped off that wreck & your roommate is on a sinking ship (with your ex) that the rats aren't even on anymore. I'm sorry this is happening to you and it feels terrible. You will get through it! It will get better! Take time to learn the difference between being alone and being lonely. Get to know yourself and make yourself the most interesting person you can! After all, in the end, the person you spend the most time with will be yourself",
            "This really sucks dude. This kind of stuff is why friends being attracted to each other is a recipe for fuck-ups. When things go wrong you lose friends on top of that, which hurts twice *and* leaves you with less support.\n\nThis is totally the mistake of your friends for not being open about this. I get why they didn't cause it's scaaaary to bring up, but by trying to keep it hidden they just set everyone up for pain. I would expect they also feel shitty for having lost a friend. I hope so at least.",
            "I think you\u2019re not being controlling at all and you\u2019re being pretty good about how you handle this situation (which is really hard). Honestly, they don\u2019t seem like great people, so it\u2019s probably good that you found out and they\u2019re out of your life. \n\nI say this as someone who started dating one of my close friends. His ex-gf *hated* me because we also had chemistry (we had been friends for years before they briefly dated), but their breaking up didn\u2019t have anything to do with me. He and I didn\u2019t start dating until eight months after they broke up, and when she told him that she was jealous of me/I sensed it, we both really limited the amount of time we spent together while they were dating. He and I never dated because I had been in a long, abusive, and awful relationship for the first five years that we knew each other. When I finally extricated myself (after many attempts and being guilted back by fake suicide threats from my ex) my bf and I started to date. But again, the breakup was about *me*, and me learning that I don\u2019t have to be responsible for other people/don\u2019t need to stay in a relationship I hate. Not because my bf and I wanted to date. As other people have noted, I think it\u2019s likely that they\u2019ll do this to each other at some point.",
            "I would imagine that they started it behind your back. Kept it all going while you two were together. Now they're ready to be with each other but still love the sneaking around part. Just cut them out of your life for now. You don't need this.",

            "This is a fairly obvious point, but you really are better off without both of them, and one day that's going to sink in. Just hang on until that day arrives. Therapy should help you get there.\n\nThe big battle is your own pride and hurt ego. Those bruises will fade, as bruises do, and you'll move on stronger for having fought this one.",

            "I read this yesterday and meant to reply but it looks like most of the responses already captured my thoughts but I did want to say you handled this VERY well. You seem very well adjusted, when something like this happens people tend to approach it with anger and resentment and that's the easy route but you are approaching it rationally and with the intent to just protect yourself and thats awesome. Just wanted to applaud you on that as it's rare these days. \n\nAlso just wanted to add (and apologize if someone already stated this) that the one thing you will need to come to terms with is that if/when they start a relationship there is a good chance you will hear about it and they may cut you off completely. You may feel like this is meant as aggression towards you but it's not, it has more to do with their selfishness. Just remember you didn't do anything wrong and what they (especially your roommate) have essentially decided is that their new relationship is more important than the friendship you had and that is a reflection of who THEY are, not who you are. It will be difficult but chalk it up as seeing their true selves early on and not having to deal with that kind of immaturity and drama in your life. Its truly a loss for them, not you. Wish you the best!",
            "A partner can have lots of friends and situations vary, but generally it's a box of red flags if they're so close to an ex that the ex is practically a life partner. If they hang out together, share emotions, collaborate etc it's more like they have a relationship with the ex, they're not over them at all, and it's time to break up. I'm not sure if I would even want to date someone who was in the same workplace as their ex which for most people means they spend more time together than with family or friends.",
            "Bruh. What awful people. I'm sorry you had to go through that, no one should have to experience that. Take care of yourself.",
            "wow that pretty rough! I think it's definitely not healthy for you to be around either of them. I think you are letting your housemate especially get off way to easy. I do understand that holding onto anger is only hurting you, but this early on you've gotta be pissed! I hope for your sake that this only started after the break up due to her having a crush on him - i hope she's just the rebound. She probably is just the rebound .... \n\nShe clearly didn't value your friendship - times like this show who you're true friends are and she is definitely not one of them. Tell her she has 2 weeks to move out. It's so not okay. She is the one with the power to respect your boundaries and not allow him to come over and hangout and rather do it elsewhere if she must. She sounds like a horrible person with no regard for anyone but herself. She is not someone you should have in your life! Maybe nothing went on while you two were together and he did just consider her a friend because of your relationship they spent a lot of time together. I think after you two broke up she probably told him how she feels and he's probably again using her as a rebound.",
            "The exact same thing happened to me. For your own sanity, black them out. Block them, don\u2019t talk to them, don\u2019t go searching for them, don\u2019t continue any relationship with either of them. Trust me. Get as far away from the situation as you can as soon as possible.",

Some people are just going to suck. It will hurt like hell but there\u2019s better people in the world out there who will treasure their friendship with you, and you as a person.

They have respected your boundaries by not bringing it into your home, and she is doing her best to make the process of you no longer living together easy. They haven\\`t told you about their relationship (if they even have one) yet, because you broke up not long ago and you\\`re still having to live together, so broadcasting their new relationship would seem unnecessary, and that\\`s their choice.  You were only together for 10 months, so moving on after a couple of weeks seems fair enough. There is no grace period. \n\nThis sounds like a painful situation. It\\`s painful when someone brakes up with you, and to see them with someone else. It\\`s sad when that pain stops you from seeing a friend because it hurts too much to be around the person that they\\`re now with. But I don\\`t think trying to prove that they\\`re doing something wrong, or dissecting their every action to show how they\\`ve betrayed you or disrespected you is a particularly useful way to process that pain.\n\nThe top comment says that it\\`s fucked. How is it fucked up to give a relationship a shot for 10 months, then recognize that it\\`s not what you want, end it, and spend time getting to know someone else that they may have a good relationship with? If he cheated on you, that was shit of him, but it sounds much more likely that he just naturally developed feelings for someone else, and after realizing that, did the right thing and ended it with you.",
            "I think that your instincts are right here. And I think that you're doing all the right things--setting and enforcing your boundaries and asking your roommate to leave. \n  \nUnfortunately, we can't stop people from doing jerk thinks. We can only control how we deal with the fallout. And you're doing the best that you possibly can. As painful as it is, it's better to know now what kind of people your roommate and ex-boyfriend are.

            "Well I'm gonna be downvoted but I've been in a somewhat similar situation but on the ex's perspective. I delayed the breakup and was catching feels from someone else without noticing it. I denied my feelings and re-evaluated my relationship and all that was wrong with it and broke up with my ex before pursuing a new relationship.\nI won't lie and say that my hidden feelings weren't one of the reasons for the breakup but they weren't, by far, the main reason. Even if I had never met the other guy I would have still broken up because there was just so much wrong with the relationship and I didn't see a future for it anymore. I no longer loved him, and that's a valid reason to break up. It just wasn't working anymore, he was heartbroken of course, and I felt terrible for that but would have been worse to keep dragging him and pretend everything was great when it wasn't. \nThat said, I did not allow myself to accept my feelings before the breakup. One month later I started dating. It was a short period of time, but since I was the one who dumped him, naturally I moved on faster. And that's valid. It's my life and I was ready. I wasn't going to wait because I didn't want to hurt him. The moment I broke up, it was no longer my problem. I'm sorry if it hurts you, I really am, but you have to understand people move on, faster or slower, and that's just the way it is.\nWhether he cheated or not doesn't matter anymore, but it pisses me off when people assume cheating is the only reason to end a relationship. Even if they are together now, does it even matter? \n\nNow, they are close to you and her being your roommate I think she respected your boundaries by not bringing him inside. If you are at the point you count the days they hang out together, I'd say leaving the place is the best option for you, as it's not good for you to so that. You need to clear your mind and heal properly. If it hurts you this much, you have every right to cut them out of your life if that's what it takes you to heal. \nI just think it's selfish to think they won't pursue anything until you heal. If anything, I think he did great by being honest and leaving you instead of lying to you.\nTake your time, heal and it will get better.",

            "First I want to tell you how incredibly sorry I am for your loss. Losing anyone who means something to us in our lives is something we can\u2019t ever really prepare for. And losing a sibling is such a layered loss, because it\u2019s not just a family member but it\u2019s someone you\u2019ve bonded with your whole lives. Sometimes they\u2019re more than a sibling, they\u2019re your friend & It\u2019s such a special relationship. I think sibling grief can get pushed aside a lot of the time because people focus on the parents or spouse the most. But I see you and I\u2019m sending you a lot of love. \n\nUnfortunately I\u2019ve been through something incredibly similar. Three years ago I lost my little brother who was only a year younger than me, we were really close growing up so of course this devastated me and my family. He was the youngest of the four of us (23 yrs when he died) and was the glue of the family. I\u2019ve had miscarriages, lost grandparents and uncles, but this truly shook me to my core and continues to be something I struggle with daily. \n\nAnyway, I was with someone at the time and we were in a very rocky relationship for 7 years. He was never able to emotionally be there for me through much of anything. Looking back I\u2019m unsure why I stayed with him for so long. I guess it was the comfort of consistency even though it was consistently chaotic and toxic But our breaking point was after my brother died and he was totally incapable of holding any space for me to feel comfortable grieving. \n\nHe didn\u2019t want to spend any time with my family and I as we all came together and made preparations for the funeral. He said it would be \u201ctoo awkward for him\u201d, which I understand, but if the roles were reversed I would have pushed past the awkwardness if it meant my presence was helpful and made him feel supported. \n\nHe also started multiple fights with me complaining that I was \u201cbitchy and snappy lately\u201d\u2026.literally a few days after my brother had died\u2026I think being on edge is to be expected. \nHe also went to two parties while I stayed at my parents house from sun up to sun down with my family planning things and making sure people ate, diffusing fights that would come from everyone being overwhelmed with grief and exhaustion and he never did much to make me feel supported. I felt like I was a burden to him. \n\nIt was only two weeks after my brothers death and a couple days after the funeral that something clicked, and I realized he was never going to be able to be there for me during this time the way I needed someone. So I broke up with him. A month later he was with someone new. I knew it was all for the best but that still hurt. You feel so easily replaceable. \n\nI can\u2019t even begin to tell how alone I felt and how hard it was to get through the next three years. But I know that had I continued dating that person, I would have NEVER been able to begin to heal. Looking back now I am so grateful I ended things with him when I did. And as much as it sucks to be going through a breakup after losing your brother and your pet, I promise you, you\u2019re better off without him. He was never going to be able to be the strong supportive partner you deserve. He would have made your healing and grieving journey so much more difficult than it already will be. Some people just aren\u2019t capable of being who we want or need. It hurts, but it\u2019s okay because we have the option to let them go. \n\nI struggled for years to grasp the concept of what a healthy relationship was, but after a lot of therapy and my own spiritual journey, I\u2019ve learned SO much about myself. My life isn\u2019t perfect, I still struggle everyday with the loss of my brother and some insecurities from my relationship with that ex, but I know how to navigate my emotions better because I allowed myself to let go of the relationship that was holding me back from healing. \n\nI\u2019m now with someone who is incredibly kind and good in ways I constantly begged my ex to be. And while my current bf doesn\u2019t understand the capacity of my loss and grief of my brother, he still does everything he can to make sure I know he\u2019s there for me whenever I need or want him. \nYou will find someone like that too if you give yourself time to heal from this season of loss you\u2019re going through. It won\u2019t be easy by any means, it\u2019ll probably be the hardest thing you ever do, but in the end when you find your way back to yourself, you\u2019ll find you have so much more in you than you think. More strength, more love, more understanding, more empathy. And you\u2019ll attract the right people into your life. \n\nMy only advice is to allow yourself to feel it all. Lean into every feeling you have. When you want to cry, cry. When you want to reminisce on memories of your brother that make you smile and be happy, smile and be happy. Don\u2019t hold back. It\u2019s so incredibly important to get all those sad dark feelings out so you can make room for better days ahead. \n\nMy whole heart goes out to you, and I hope you have a strong family and friends to talk to and lean on right now. I know we\u2019re strangers but I also know what it\u2019s like to have no one who seems to understand the experience you\u2019re having right now, so if you ever need someone to talk to who has an idea of what you\u2019re going through, please feel free to message me.",

            "My ex did similar to me, too. My brother was murdered, and he was physically and emotionally absent.

I told him I wouldn't be leaning on this friend if he was there for me. Turns out he had a crush on one of his coworkers. Took another 10 months before he finally left me for her.\n\nI'm so sorry you've dealt with this. You deserve so much better than him.

            "Throughout my life, I have found that losing someone to death is the ultimate test in a relationship. You'd be surprised how many partners actually can't handle someone else grieving.",
            "You deserve better! Keep your chin up girly, Ik life is probably hard right now but you can keep going! There\u2019s someone out there who will treat you right and love you fully. In the meantime, we love you \ud83d\udda4",
            "You deserve someone who will support you no matter what - during grief, during happiness, during anything. You can be that person for yourself, right now.",
            "Oh geez!  Bless ur heart!",
            "I am so sorry that happened to you. No one deserves that. I am also sorry for your loss of your brother. You should have had a stronger support and you \"bf\" stole that from you. Sending you hugs",
            "Chiming in with condolences for your loss(es). I propose you take many loving self care baths, you cry it out as much as you need, and you find comforting meals to eat every day. \n\nThe cruelty from your ex is real. It\u2019s easy to say you did nothing wrong, other than holding on to someone unhealthy for you when they should\u2019ve been let go. Hold on to the reality that the \u201cdifferences\u201d were your grief, the grief you are allowed to feel. The fact that you changed because a traumatizing event happened, not because you were bad, not because you couldn\u2019t hold yourself together, because that shouldn\u2019t even be an expectation at this point. You should only be together enough to not relinquish your agony on others, and even so it\u2019s a common response to such loss. 100% you\u2019re valid in all your feelings and as long as you\u2019re getting up and eating something every day I\u2019m proud of you.",
            "I'm so sorry for your loss! This is us a new chapter for you. I wish you all the best! \ud83d\udc9f",
            "Im so sorry for your loss, and it sucks how this guy checked out on you when you needed him the most, even if he didnt feel like a partner anymore, at least as a friend.  You did good, this person did not deserve you, your time or your attention. Timing sucked but you will get over this, you got this!",
            "Your boyfriend more than likely went on Grindr to meet this man. His intention was to cheat without admitting his sexual needs. I guess he succeeded and you both got what you need now. You dodged a bullet OP.",
            "Eventually his time will come too, and at that point he shall be judged.",
            "Wow, this is why I would question dating a bisexual. They're much more likely to do this in my experience. Anyways, I hope you process your grief well and find someone who is not \"fair weather\". Inability to care about your grief is a huge problem. I remember one of my exes grandmother died and so I drove all the way across the country with her (she was scared of flying and didn't want to drive alone) later on when my grandma died she basically told me to get over it.",
