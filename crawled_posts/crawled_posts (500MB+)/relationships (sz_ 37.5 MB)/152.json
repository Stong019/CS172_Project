He was pretty shocked but affirmed that nothing physical happened and he\u2019s been faithful. I asked him to give me space and told him I needed him to find another place to stay. He said he was going to figure out the logistics but wanted to work it out. Said he loved me and I was the center of his world. I told him that his words did not match his actions. I told him I have too much self-respect to let myself be treated that way. \n\nSince we spoke on the phone, I have received many negative text messages. Can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. He\u2019s revealing his immaturity. So I didn\u2019t block him but I hid the alerts and I\u2019m going No Contact for the rest of the day. \n\nThanks for everyone that gave their input. It\u2019s ended the way I knew it was going to when I made that post.. I just didn\u2019t want to admit it. \n\nHope everyone has a nice weekend. I certainly have a load taken off my shoulders. \n\nTl;dr I posted on Reddit about my boyfriend, knowing I needed to break up with him but in denial. Reddit said to break up. We broke up. Quite formulaic actually. ",

A few months later he cheated on me with a different girl and then broke up with me before I figured out. I figured out the day after because everyone told me. You deserve someone who you can trust.

He had a new girlfriend when we were separated and broke it off with me again. 2 weeks before he got engaged to this girl he told me he was just using her for rent. 2 weeks after he got engaged he wanted to talk to me for maybe pursuing our relationship again. So, even when he wanted to sweeten his words (as in, maybe sounding appealing to me and like he doesn't care about this girl), he is just full of shit and I feel bad for his new fiance. I found a new boyfriend and I can fully trust him and I just feel sooooo secure in this relationship, it's insane. Maybe I'm not paranoid after all and it's really about finding a trusting person on your side. Keep it up, you deserve better! ",

        "selftext": "So I met her earlier this year, we were fast friends within a month of meeting and dating after a month, official for 6 months or so. Met her on a night out with some friends. \n\nWe live separately but she spends a lot of time at my house as it's nearer to where she works. Our relationship started really nicely, I felt like we just got on really well and she was very supportive of me as well. But recently she's been quite pushy about me making changes to my lifestyle and seems angry and disappointed with the results. The two big ones are my work and what I wear.\n\nAs for my work, I work at the same store I've worked at since I was 16, it's just an easy job, pays my bills and I know how to do everything there, I'm basically a manager without the responsibility of actually being a manager as I don't want that level of responsibility for no extra pay. I also make money via stocks and crypto currencies so I don't struggle for money.\n\nAs for what I like to wear? I have many jumpers and T shirts of an emo band my friends and I loved when we were young, I genuinely have like 50 or so that I wear a lot because it makes me happy, and doesn't hurt anyone either.\n\nI admit I have a bit of a problem with anxiety, familiarity helps me with it, some family thinks I might have OCD but I've never been diagnosed. \n\nMy girlfriend a few weeks ago expressed frustration with my clothes, saying I need to grow up and get new ones. She spends a lot of money to get whatever clothes are in fashion, I don't have a problem with that as it's her money to spend and she isn't hurting anyone. But I don't know why she has a problem with my clothes. The argument was big but resolved and we went shopping and bought me some new clothes, they are actually quite nice and I like wearing them too. A few days later I was wearing a band T shirt again because the new clothes were in the wash and she was really angry about it. I explained the new clothes were in the wash and it wasn't decided that I'd completely stop wearing the band stuff. She wouldn't talk to me for the rest of the day, the next day she had cooled off and explained that she thinks new clothes will help me grow as a person. We talked a long time and I eventually agreed to get rid of the band clothes. \n\nWhile I was packing them up I started crying and she called me stupid and I asked her to leave. She came back a few hours later and we made up, I packed the boxes into my car and told her I was gonna donate them, she was really pleased and said I was making the right choice getting rid of them. I didn't donate them, I took them to work and I'm keeping them there until further notice, my boss was confused but understanding. I got back home and she'd ordered my lots of new clothes. She told me she understands it was upsetting but I'd be better off for it. That night a few hours later she wanted to talk about my work and why I'm not a manager. I explained to her that I don't want to be.\n\nShe's been distant and only talks about how I should ask to be a manager, I've explained why I don't want to be, and that I wouldn't even be paid more, nor is there a need for it at the store. She just keeps saying that I need to fight for a pay rise as well so I can treat us to nice things. I told her that isn't how it works and that I make money in other ways and that she has her own money too so it shouldn't matter. She shouted at me that I'm useless and stormed out. My boss also told me she called the store and asked him why I'm not a manager.\n\nAfter being upset and feeling useless for a few hours I decided that I don't want to be with her. I realized I don't see my friends as much as I used to because she likes to spend all our free time just us.  I just don't feel happy with her anymore and feel like she actually acted differently when we started out just to get close to me, she even said she loved all the band stuff when I first showed her. I think she may be right that new clothes might help me a bit, I genuinely appreciate that and like how I look in some of the clothes we bought. But I also liked how I looked in the band stuff, and still think it wasn't over the top, I'd normally just wear jeans and a T shirt or jumper anyway, I don't think it's as ridiculous as she said it was. I just thought of it as a wearable collection, people collect weirder things.\n\nAs well as this, I really don't like that I lied to her about donating the band stuff, it felt horrible and dishonest, my boss and colleagues could tell something was off when I took the boxes into work. I try to be honest as I don't want to upset people.\n\n\\*\\*TLDR\\*\\* my gf of 6 months has become controlling and angry at me and made me get rid of some clothes that are special to me, is also trying to get me to become a manager at my work, even called my boss to ask about it. I've decided I want to leave her but I'm scared to because she can be manipulative and angry.\n\nAnyway, I want to break up with her but I know it's gonna be difficult, she's good at talking me into stuff but my mind is made up 100% on this. I'm still not sure when or how to do it though, I'm feeling really anxious about it. Wondering if you guys can give me some advice or help? How can I be assertive about wanting to break up and not have her talk me out of it?",

            "Yes, I think you are right to break up with her. She crossed all sorts of lines, IMO.\n\nIt\u2019s fine that she made some suggestions on clothing, and even that she expressed that she preferred that while in public. But asking you to get rid of them all together?! Or to not wear it while lounging around the house, or at the gym or doing yard work type of thing?! That\u2019s crossing the line into controlling.\n\nIt\u2019s ok for her to ask about your position at work. But calling your boss?!? That\u2019s a MAJOR line she crossed there. That\u2019s completely unacceptable. She was treating you like a child. That\u2019s highly disrespectful\u2026\n\nIt takes two people to decide to be in a relationship. It takes one to decide to break up. When you go to have the conversation - just remember that you aren\u2019t asking for her permission or for her to agree - you are simply informing her of your decision.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m not a fan of the \u201cin public\u201d advise unless you feel she may be violent. Just get together with her when you can, inform her of your decision, give her a few minutes (maybe 10 or 20) to ask questions as needed and then cut it off. The whole conversation need not last more than 20 minutes\u2026",
            "I think your response to all of this was completely reasonable. You opened yourself up to her suggestions and to trying new things, and you kept your boundaries about not wanting to enter a management position at your store. I think you have a healthy view point on yourself, your life, and what makes you happy. The fact that she called your work to complain without telling you is a major red flag. \n\nWhen you end things, I would just suggest that you stay focused on the fact that you were willing to change and try new things, while she was hard line and disrespectful of your choices. Someone who really cares about you would behave more like you did- seeking compromise. It is going to be uncomfortable, but you can do it! If she becomes angry, ask her to leave or leave the situation yourself, but don\u2019t waver on the fact that the relationship is over. \n\nI would strongly suggest going no-contact after the break up, so that she cannot manipulate you out of your decision.",
            "Oh boy.  I feel like at 6 months is when people's true colors come out, and boy did hers!  Here's the advice I'd give (some is a repeat of other advice on this thread):\n\n1) Get back all your stuff, and wear what makes you feel most confident.\n\n2) Schedule a time to meet up somewhere neutral and public.\n\n3) If she has a key to your home, change all your locks.  Keep you car parked inside a locked garage if you have one.\n\n4) Gather up any item she has at your house so she doesn't have an excuse to ever go back there.  Take it with you to give to her at the meeting, after the breakup.  This will let her know you are absolutely serious. If she say she left such-and-such, tell her you will mail it.\n\n5) At the meetup/ breakup, be firm.  Don't leave any room for options \"down the road\" or if she begs that she'll change.  She won't change, she'll just try to fool you a little longer.\n\n6) When she asks why, be clear and honest:\n\n \"I like who I am, but you keep wanting me to change.\"\n\n\"Honestly, you're not very nice to me.\"\n\n \"I miss my friends and my old life.\"  \n\n \"It's clear you want someone different. I think you should be free to go find that person.\"\n\nand the big one, \"You called my work and asked my boss why I wasn't manager.  That is completely unacceptable behavior for anyone, let alone someone I've only been dating for six months.\"\n\nGood luck!",
            "There have been some good points made in this thread but a lot of people seem to have missed the fact that she called your job to harass your boss. Your partner took it upon themselves to harass your boss on your behalf. This is not a small thing and it's wildly inappropriate. It seems like you didn't have much trouble from your boss but it could have gone very differently.",
            "I'm so glad you didn't throw out those band t's !!!",
            ">How can I be assertive about wanting to break up and not have her talk me out of it?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not working for me.\u201d If she demands an explanation, \u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence.\n\nShe sees you as an improvement project.  Implicit in that is the idea that you\u2019re substandard, or incomplete, or even broken.  But you don\u2019t seem any of those things, and she\u2019ll make your life a living hell if you stay with her, as she shapes and molds and scolds and cajoles you into behaving as she wants.",
            "Ugh. She\u2019s one of those women who treats their partner like a fixer-upper project. If she wanted to date a career go-getter who dressed in a particular way, then she should have kept looking till she found that guy. \n\nWhen you talk to her, keep in mind that she doesn\u2019t want to date *you*. She just wants to date someone that she can nag and bully into being her perfect partner.  You deserve better than that.\n\nAlso, this is fucking delusional:\n\n>My boss also told me she called the store and asked him why I'm not a manager.",
            "The honeymoon is over, and she is showing you her true colors, and those colors are of a person who doesn't want to be with *you*, she wants to be with the idealized version of you that she has created in her mind and is now attempting to transform you into.\n\nThere is no future for you here but heartache.  Because either you will remain the person you are, and she will continue to punish you for it, or you will *try* to be the person she thinks you \"should\" be, but who you are not actually, and the friction between who you want to be and who you are pretending to be will cause you to become exhausted, frustrated, and resentful.\n\nWhich is better, in your mind:  A relationship where she despises you for being who you *are*, or a relationship where you end up despising her because she won't *let* you be who you are?\n\nPick one of those, because those are the potential futures you have with her.\n\nOr leave.",
            "Okay so she sounds awful and you're absolutely right to get rid of her. THAT SAID, I've done a quick skim of the comments and I haven't seen this addressed: As you get older, you're going to find it more and more difficult to find a partner who is content with you working the same job that you had at 16, with no intention to advance in your career in any way. Even if you have income from investments, that's not as reliable of an income as most people prefer.\n\nThis is an opportunity for you to think about what you want out of your future when it comes to work and when it comes to your relationships. If you see a future that involves something like marriage and kids, you may want to consider how you can demonstrate ambition, growth, and financial security, whether that's through work or other means, and again, you'll need to be mindful that people on this path generally do look at work trajectory when deciding on a long-term partner. Alternatively, if you see yourself maintaining your current lifestyle indefinitely or permanently (and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that decision!), that's something you should be more up front about with future partners so as not to waste time with someone who's looking for the other type of relationship. There does tend to be an implicit understanding in dating that things will grow towards a long term relationship, so this is something you'll unfortunately need to be extra vocal about.",
            "The best therapist I've ever had told me \"Act your boundaries, don't explain them\" as advice to stop being talked out of ending things with someone. (I struggle with it sometimes, but used to not be able to accomplish it at all)\n\nIt helps me to really look at the amount of information I give someone that I let talk me out of things often, and I'm not happy in this relationship is all the reason really needed to break up with someone.  \n\n\nETA: lol of course I forgot the thing I struggle with the most in this issue: ending the conversation. You aren't obligated to sit there until she's done with you just b/c you're breaking up. That's how I end up getting talked out of it usually. I forget I can end it.",

            "Omg you need to dump her! I would meet her somewhere neutral to do it, like a cafe or park. And don't feel like you need to give too many explanations. She sounds awful!

            "She\u2019s not right in how she went about what she did by any means. But you\u2019ve had the same job since you were 17? You\u2019re 30 now, you shouldn\u2019t be doing the exact same thing that you did as a teen. Her concern is that you need to evolve and learn new skills but you seem overly comfortable in underachieving. But ya break up with her and think about ways you can improve your life.",
            "It seems like you've behaved perfectly reasonably and her meddling has cross into inappropriately controlling behaviour.\n\nI'm afraid there isn't an easy and decent way to end the relationship. After 6 months, you should end it in person unless you have reason to think she'll be violent. I'd suggest meeting her wherever she lives and delivering the news there. It gives her a chance to be upset and recover privately, without any public embarrassment. Absolutely don't end things at your place.\n\nFigure out what your going to say in advance, keeping it to a few sentences. Be kind, but firm. Give her a very brief explanation, focused on you, while avoiding assigning any blame. Once you've said your piece, which shouldn't take more than a minute, get up and leave. No matter what she says, don't drawn into a debate. You don't need to negotiate a break up.\n\nOh, and if you have any important stuff at her place, get it back before the break up. If you have any of her stuff, bring it with you to the break up in a container that isn't immediately obvious.",
            "I'm sorry you're in this situation, she sounds like she's basically bullying you at this point and regardless of her intentions she is **100% wrong** in how she's going about this.\n\nThe good news is, she doesn't actually live with you. So if you're afraid of having a face-to-face discussion about this, just box up everything of hers that may be at your place, send her a text saying something like \"Hey, look we have had some good times but at this point I don't actually see us being long term, and this relationship has run its course. I wish you all the best, and hope after we've had some time apart moving on, we can be friends some time in the future. But for now, I need to take some time to heal and I'm not going to be discussing this with you. I have a box of your things which I'll put outside for you to pick up ASAP, but otherwise I wish you all the best\"\n\nYou don't need to talk to her about this, you don't need to convince her or give her a 2nd chance or \"fight\" for the relationship etc... you can tell her you're done and that's it. If she demands you to explain just repeat \"I don't want to discuss this\". Block her number & on social media etc asap everywhere so she can't wear you down. \n\nIf you really want to do it in person, do it in public (bring along that box packed with her stuff so you can hand it over right there), ask a friend to be there with you and have them agree to back you up and help shut the conversation down if she starts trying to push back on the break up so that she can't bully you into staying with her. Block her everywhere. Seriously don't be afraid to ask a trusted friend to be your heavy, you're in an abusive relationship and you deserve support just as anyone else does. I am sure you have a friend or two who love you and would be happy to have your back in that situation. Hell, if you're in Minneapolis/St Paul & don't think you have a friend you can call on, my SO and I will be your back up.\n\nAnd honestly, you sound like a very nice dude to hang out with and have as a friend, so I'll say this to you that I would to a friend. I think at your age, you're unlikely to find a woman at the same age as you whose actually going to be happy to commit long term to a man who sounds like he's stuck living at the same level a 17 yr old does, without the ambition or drive to improve their life. You have found your comfort zone and you're sticking within it, which is absolutely fine and entirely your right, but you will find as you get older it's going to come with some realities in respect to finding a long term partner. So if you're comfortable the way you are, make that **really** clear when you're starting to date someone so that they know you're not a \"project\", and you're not looking to change your life. It may help avoiding this kind of situation. And if you realize at some point you're no longer happy in your comfort zone, I recommend you invest in therapy, it will really help you find the balance that suits you instead of feeling overwhelmed at all the options of change and just staying stuck.\n\nGood luck man.",
            "Honestly, I wouldn't be particularly attracted to the lack of career direction or dress sense. I see why she thinks the things she does. \n\nHowever. \n\nShe crossed several large red lines in her behavior. Forcing you to throw out your old clothes? This isn't a reality show, it's real life, and in real life people keep sloppy or less Put Together clothes to wear casually or around the house. \n\nCalling your boss? That's batshit. A serious violation of boundaries. \n\nIt's okay to have doubts about your partner's lack of ambition, and it's okay for that to give you second thoughts about the potential for a real future. I've had similar thoughts about boyfriends in the past. But the way she's handling it isn't okay, and she's walking all over you. \n\nAlso, did I see you mention missing your friends?

You said you have alot of anxiety and I think its really holding you back from trying new things, you actually liked the new clothes you bought.

She intentionally hid her controlling nature and gold digging, materialistic needs, character traits that you would have known to be unhealthy and wrong for you.\n\nThe worst part of this is that she didn't even try to hide these things until much later; most people tend to hide these things until they're out of the honeymoon stage and have their partner locked into some sort of commitment to make it harder for them to leave. \n\nJust leave. You owe her no explanation, and she honestly doesn't deserve your empathy. Break up with her and block her. \n\nOtherwise, she will just do anything to get you back. Be careful if you have sex before breaking up and make sure you use protection so she doesn't try to trap you.\n\nStand up for yourself. Tell her that you're not happy and don't like what she is doing. Tell her that you will not be convinced to stay, and that you will block her if she tries to get to you.\n\nUltimately, if you want to break up, nobody can stop you. It's your right to not want to be with someone, and they have zero right to force you to stay.\n\n\nRepeat the last paragraph to yourself as many times as needed to convince yourself to stick by your decision.",

She doesn't respect your job, she hates your clothes, she emotionally manipulates you, degrades you for being upset. All of these are major red flags and serious personality defects.\n\nIf she doesn't want to be with someone who doesn't have career ambitions beyond a lower wage, relatively simple, stress free job, that's her choice. But she shouldn't date someone in that position and then decide it's her job to \"change\" them into someone she finds suitable to date. You're a human being, not a barbie doll.\n\nA break up, unlike a relationship, is absolutely a one way street. Once you break up, she doesn't have a say anymore. If she disagrees, then bless her heart, just keep acting like yall are broken up. Trying to convince (i.e. manipulate) someone to stay in a relationship that makes them unhappy is abusive behavior, so just keep reminding yourself that it will only get worse, not better. Six months tends to be when people are generally on their *best* behavior because it's still in the honeymoon phase. You've seen her best behavior, don't stick around for the worst.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited to add:  She *called your boss!?* I would have broken up immediately for that.

Do this when you're noticing a thought or if the big feelings are already there. \n\nOnto the breakup advice. First off, the when? Let's not get into time of day. Let's get into the timeline. In person, soon, like, within two or three days. Learn from me: I put up a breakup once and \\*the guy's father died.\\* \n\nStart doing things like: 1) gather up all her stuff 2) gather any gifts 3) ring your landlord and ask about locks 3a) optional, go to B & Q or some other hardware/Do It Yourself store and ask for a rubber or chrome security door wedge, won't stop anyone, will slow them down. Also there are masses of articles about DIY locks. \n\nWhere? Let her know you need to get something off your chest (or whatever, indicate a big conversation is coming) and you want to meet up at hers.\n\nAfter you have that phone call, Follow all the advice you've gotten about having anything of hers on hand, any gifts. \n\nHow to be assertive? Write yourself a script, using the words below, the advice here, or your own head. Use \\*I\\* statements, meaning you say, \"I \\[whatever\\]\" vs. \"You\". NEVER  use anything like, \"You're great!\" or \"it's not me, it's you.\" \n\nFamiliarity sometimes helps your anxiety, right? So I'm going to tell you to refer to Captain Awkward post 118.

It either turns into a 'Here is a list of all the reasons I don\u2019t love you anymore' or a hair-splitting argument about why those reasons are not good enough and the person won\u2019t agree to be broken up with until you present an airtight case.\n\nRather than getting bogged down in explanations, just say 'I\u2019m so sorry, but I\u2019ve really thought about this, and it\u2019s the right decision for me.' Don\u2019t try to sell him on it being the right decision for him, or for both of you. Let him decide that, and save whatever face he can.\n\nYou actually help both of you by making it completely about your own needs.  You need to be broken up.  That need overrides all others, and can\u2019t really be argued with.\"\n\nIf she DOES try to argue, I want you to DOUBLE AND TRIPLE DOWN on clear communication. \"I feel this.\" \"I felt this.\" \"I am not happy.\"  This means, you don't bring up the shirt stuff, because she will backtrack. I discourage you even from bringing up the boss thing, because she will backtrack and be iike, \"I only did it for us! I love you and want what's best for us!\" and Not Get It. Or act like she does Get It and change again because, newsflash, this is who she's been all along and she was waiting until you were comfortable. \n\nIf you MUST bring up a reason, make it about YOU. \"I found it really difficult to keep talking about changing my role at work.\" \n\nHer: \"But I want what's best for you! Babe, I love you!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I know what's best for me.\" \n\nUse \\*I\\* statements and try to keep it to a mix of facts and YOUR feelings. \n\nHer: OMG I'll do anything.\n\nYou: This breakup is what's best for me. Please try to respect my decision.\n\nHer: @$#@$@#!!!@\n\n\"I need to go now.\"\n\nHer: \"Well clearly you never really loved me!\"\n\nYou: \"I am sorry I hurt you.

Her behavior is a major red flag for control issues, and your mentioning that you haven't hung out with your friends as much due to her screams that she's attempting to isolate you as well. No one should dictate what their bf/gf wears if they're comfortable with what they're wearing. Buying you new clothing is a nice gesture, but demanding you get rid of your usual clothes is controlling and utterly unreasonable. \n\nThere are a lot of red flags here. I think that you're making the right decision to break up here. If she's started acting like this after 6 months, it will only get worse as time goes on. Plus, calling your boss like that is NOT a normal action.",
            "To be honest man it sounds like you should take what you can out of this and leave.\n\nBy that I mean you are probably right, the new clothes will probably help you out so she was right about that at least but it doesn't mean you have to never wear your old stuff ever again or give it away. The way she handled it sounds horrible and completely unsupportive.\n\nBin the girl, keep the new clothes.",
            "You are making a very good decision.\n\nMeet with her at a coffee shop or somewhere neutral and public, but where you can have a little privacy (not your home).   Let her know, on reflection, that this relationship isn't working for you.  Just like that:  \"X, I've been thinking a lot about our relationship and it's just not working out for me.   I don't think our goals or personalities are compatible.  I wish you well.\"  You don't have to go into it more than that.  Don't let her argue, get up and leave if she tries.  Remember you aren't trying to repair the relationship, it's over, so you don't need to hash out what she did wrong or should change about herself.  \n\nIf she's left stuff at your place, gather them up and box them and offer to drop them off at a place of her choosing.\n\nIf she has a key change the locks.\n\nThen block her from your social media and make a post saying that you've broken up with her, that she was verbally abusive, overly demanding, and was messing things up for you at work, and that if by any chance she asks any of your friends to try talk you into giving her a second chance, to just politely say, \"no\" because you are 100% done with her.'\n\nChances are your friends have already noticed her behavior and this won't be a surprise for them.",

That's the person she really wants.\n\nIf you want to continue being you, this is probably not the relationship for you. Or her.\n\nAnd she has wicked boundary issues. Some folks would find themselves fired after their manager receiving a phone call like that from their other.",
            "I want to touch on you saying she's \"good at talking you into stuff\". I bet part of this is because you see truth in some of her points, and you've maybe considered them yourself, and also because you're probably kind of tough on yourself (I'm the same way). It's really hard to stay strong in the face of someone who feels \"right\", even if we think they are crossing boundaries. Calling your boss is beyond the pale, making you feel like you have to toss eveyrthing vs get some new items is a lot of pressure.  Good, healthy partners don't make you feel afraid to say no, and I bet she is likely to spin this as \"I just want what's best for you and got overzealous, I love you so much I want to help you and support you in changing\" and it's likely if you don't break up, she will act sweet and charming for awhile before becoming nasty again. If you don't have anything of hers and vice versa, I'd say this is an appropriate relationship to consider texting to end, or even over the phone. If you meet in person, do it in a public place that you feel safe in and be prepared for her to potentially get really loud and theatrical.  If you have mutual friends, there is a chance she may swing over to them and complain in a way that makes it seem like she was reasonable and you are being stubborn/she's worried about you, weird stuff like that.  \n\n\n\n\nBut you don't have to tolerate someone who doesn't gently push you out of your comfort zone but kicks you out of it and yells about it.  My partner needed to upgrade his wardrobe a bit (similar to yours but with lots of holes and also they don't fit him well anymore), but I didn't demand he dispose or donate; we just moved all his old shirts to a lower shelf and put some new stuff on a higher shelf. We made a quilt with some of his t-shirts that couldn't really be worn anymore, and anything he's boxed up we simply have in the closet.  You don't have to rush change, it's okay to have comfort items, it's okay to see some grains of truth in what she says but reject the giant bucket of nonsense it comes with. You deserve patience, understanding, support, and to feel safe enough to be honest with your partner.  She isn't making you feel safe, it makes sense you'd feel pressured to lie.  I might even have a friend be around the area when you break up if you can, it might help you feel more confident in sticking by your guns",
            "You sound like a good dude. You have measured responses to various situations and actions by your GF. I am much like you and do not like confrontation but you have got it right about being 100% certain about the breakout. Just pull the bandaid off the wound and get it over with. Just tell her it is just not working out for you for so many reasons. Too many to bother going into. And close the door.",

Wow.\n\nThis is going to be an unpopular opinion, but in a situation where the person could try to hurt or  manipulate you back into the relationship I do think it's okay to break up over a phone call or text. Is it a shitty way to break up with someone? Yes, but its better to just cut the ties and be done with the relationship then get looped back into it because she's crying or says she'll \"change\". She's disrespecting you on so many fronts (calling you \"useless\" for example) she deserves a bit of that disrespect back.",

Anyone who would call her SO's boss like this is crazy and thinks nothing of crossing lines.  \n\nHere's my advice:\nHave a straight-up conversation and let her know that you are ending the relationship.  If you can have the conversation in a place where you can leave (i.e. not your home) that is best.  Tell her this is non-negotiable. The fewer details you can provide, the better.

            "I think her ideas are fairly reasonable but she's going about it in the wrong way. You do not need to change because she wants that. Tell her you don't think you'll ever be the person she wants and that's okay, you're happy how you are, but you don't think you are right for her.",

I have been with my husband for 9 years and I wouldn\u2019t dare even think about calling his work for any reason\u2026 hell I VERY reluctantly called when I was in labour and I spent an hour contemplating just waiting until he was home for that one so I wouldn\u2019t have to speak to anybody there (this one is more anxiety related but still). She has crossed so many lines in such a short amount of time, I think it is best for your mental health to go your separate ways. Wear your band shirts proudly and don\u2019t let anyone tell you how to live your life :)",
            "She is absolutely out of line and exhibiting controlling and abusive behavior, but if you are wearing literally the same t-shirts you were when you were in high school and are now 30 it is time to let them go and buy new ones. By all means keep the ones that mean so much to you, but getting some new ones will either help support the band if they are still around OR help support the artists and small companies still producing merch. There are some really fabulous retro shops online that are making all sorts of 80s and 90s stuff right now. Go check them out. I know a few guys who still wear literally the same shirts they had in high school and never bought new ones even though they can afford them, and they are so worn out that it isn't a good look no matter what is on the actual shirts.",

            "So I would like to have a word with miss wanna-be someone\u2019s mother! She has absolutely no right to dictate what you can and cannot wear and as your partner she shouldn\u2019t even feel the need to do that unless you were wearing things that literally harmed you physically (in my opinion). You\u2019re literally 30, not an old man so her saying you need to grow up\u2026I don\u2019t know what teenage boys she\u2019s been around but the guys my age (18) ain\u2019t doing that! The fact that you\u2019re a grown man who has been able to keep the SAME job since he was 16 and has enough to provide for himself and have a relationship. Fuck what she thinks about the job, you obviously like the job and aren\u2019t asking her to support you financially then she really shouldn\u2019t care. What I\u2019m seeing here is that she has an image she is trying to uphold. Now if she wasn\u2019t always like that it may be because she\u2019s 32 and she feels like as a grown woman she shouldn\u2019t be dating someone who is dressing in band tees, not a manager, AND two years younger than her- those are all so trivial but she\u2019s probably mad at herself for not living up to this dream guy she may have wanted. Not to say you haven\u2019t been that guy but she is thinking too materially now and that\u2019s not the point of a relationship and especially won\u2019t make it better with it being forced down your neck. \n\nI\u2019m even more angry that she was the cause of your tears because for one your interests in bands is fucking cool and she sucks big time for telling you to get rid of them (glad you didn\u2019t)! I second the idea of breaking up with her because she is not the woman for you and it\u2019ll only progress worse if you allow her to think she has this hold/power over you. It definitely won\u2019t be easy but your mental, happiness, and wants come first regardless. Manipulation in relationships are the WORST- I\u2019ve been there and there\u2019s a huge differences in suggestions rather than totally forcing someone who doesn\u2019t want or need to change. \n\nHope things go well!!:))",
            "Dude everyone puts on their best face for first few months going as far as to enjoy ur interests(the band clothes) until she feels like she has a right to decide only 6 months into the relationship . This is gonna be the rest of your life if u stick with her . There is no \"US\" here . Only a \"HER\"\r  \n\r  \nShe doesnt want u wearing those old band clothes because she feels embarassed and ashamed of you being sol \"old\" and behind times in fashion . She wants a payraise for u to treat her to more luxury. you see OP its her desires and wants she wants fulfilled . U are happy in life and she wants better and to keep up with trends . Do you see how much compromising and giving u are doing whereas she is taking ur respect and love for her previously and using it to dictate ur actions.

I hope you have a nice, clean break, and good on you for deciding to leave. Better to be single than stuck with a toxic SO. This isn\u2019t healthy and you deserve much, much better.",
            "I think she regards you as a project and wants to fix. But if your life makes you happy theres nothing wrong with you.",
            "It sounds like you're incompatible in that you're happy with just a job that pays the bills whereas she's looking for you to be and do something else. And it's one thing to make a suggestion about someone's wardrobe or whatever, but to effectively force you to throw away your shit (glad you didn't, by the way)? That's a dog act.\n\nA wider wardrobe is always beneficial, regardless of what you wear day to day, so I don't have an issue with expanding your options (it's good to be able to pull clothes for any occasion from your own wardrobe) but her speaking to you the way she did isn't ok. It's not ok for her to call you \"stupid\". \n\nBreak ups are always difficult but let it be difficult. It's ok that it'll be tough, it's not ok to keep yourself in a relationship with someone who seems to want to change you. It's also alright that you're feeling anxious -- it makes perfect sense that you'd feel that way and anyone would feel the same in your shoes. I'd write her a letter/note so you can say exactly what you need to without rambling (of which I am guilty) and it keeps some space between you...you can tell her that you don't like how she's been talking to you, how she demands what you aren't going to give, that she doesn't seem ok with who you are right now.\n\nAs for your anxiety, that's definitely worth getting some help for. I promise you that there are lots of skills you can learn to manage the anxiety and the feelings it causes in your body. Mindfulness is a great place to start if you're interested.",

            "How to break up with her? Just go to her and say \"Ok, according to you I dress poorly and I am useless. On the other hand you are pushy, controlling and completely disregarding my opinion if it doesn't fit your narrative. We are obviously incompatible so I would like for you to take your stuff and leave. Right now.\" Beating around the bush only increases the stress and anxiety you have and makes you more vulnerable against attacks on her, thus reducing your chances of actually breaking up with her. And breaking up you should definitely do.\n\nI would still like to go into why this relationship is not okay just in case someone is still wondering and is blind to what's going on in the OP's post.\n\nPlenty of red flags here:\n\n* **Dress code** \\- it's ok to have an opinion on how your partner dresses but it's very important how you communicate that opinion and what you put on the table. In your case she completely neglected the sentimental value of the clothes you were wearing. Growing up has nothing to do with the clothes you wear (some of us might end up in diapers when old enough LOL). Dress code is about presentation and image. From what I understand none one in your circle (including at work) has problem with the way you dress except her. So it is not a case of your close are showing disrespect towards others (frankly, I see nothing wrong with jeans, T-shirt and a jumper). People skip the T-Shirt and what not and value you for what you offer. She is looking for someone, who fits her fashion narrative. She is a person that puts a lot of value in the image and presentation.\n* **Work** \\- some people just want to have a quite life, have enough income to take care of the necessary bills and be done with it. You are like that, she is definitely not. Your position at work is not up to her standards. Again - image and presentation.\n\nThere is nothing wrong in a person wanting their partner to become more. But all of this needs to be **properly discussed and a  consensus needs to be reached**. A relationship is about wants and needs. Replacing a jumper or jeans with something else is not a need, neither is growing career-wise if your current sources of income provide enough to take care of your bills. Wants are mandatory and not fulfilling those is a major issue for a normal relationship. Needs are a nice to have thing - it would be cool to have those fulfilled, but it is not critical to the survival of the relationship. Converting wants into needs indicates imbalance in the relationship. She did a mistake into pushing you to do something that 1)was not a need and 2)made you very unhappy so that she can be happy. You on the other hand made a mistake by 1)not taking a stand and 2)lying to her (boxes with your clothes at the office). And all of this is happening approx. 6 months into the relationship. To become this pushy just such a short time into a new relationship indicates that things will get much worse later on.\n\nSaying you need to fight for a raise just to her (forget the \"us\" thing - it doesn't exist) as well as calling the store to ask why you are not a manager thus neglecting the fact this might actually ruin your relationship with your boss and coworkers are signs of a very pushy and self-centered person. I would not go out on a single date with such a person. I guess she has been hiding this side of her characters the first several months. It is a wild guess but I would say that she has been either single for a long time (where only the \"me\" mattered) or she has been through series of brief relationships that fell apart due to clashes between her and her ex-s on even trivial matters.",

It's normal to feel like you're the one in the wrong but you aren't. Keep reminding yourself how you feel about these things and take note of what she responds to your feelings with.

How astute of you, Reddit!) \"pulled\" away by another woman, even though we have COMPLETELY different relationships. But regardless, it doesn't excuse what she did, so I let Dan initially reach out to her, to which I followed up later.\n\nDan gave her a call and was very nice, yet firm with her and how she treated me. Carol responded saying that she was really embarrassed and sorry and that she felt terrible and wanted to give each of us some time to cool off before reaching out. I initially told Dan that I wanted to send her an e-mail based off of what u/vanitypridelust drafted, so he told her that I would reach out when I was ready because I really wanted to frame the conversation rather than have her feel like complete crap for her outburst. So I sent her a text later in the evening and we met for breakfast this morning.\n\nShe was so apologetic and cried and I said that although it did hurt me, that I understand where she's coming from and am in no way trying to replace her. I respect her a lot because she raised my literal dream man, so even though we may not be best friends, she's done a lot of things right. We hung out for a bit, ended things wonderfully with a re-do invitation to cook dinner together this weekend - her recipes - and hugged goodbye. All is right in the world.\n\nThanks again for offering insight and perspective. Y'all are the best.\n\nP.s. Dan is the best. Can't wait to lock that shit down.

        "selftext": "My sister was born with a severe intellectual disability. This caused a big strain on our family while I was growing up. At some point my parents gave up on her and decided that she just can't be helped anymore, despite the fact that doctors thought otherwise. After she turned 18 my parents tried to petition the courts to continue be her guardian but they weren't successful.\n\nWhen she turned 19 I took her in with me and put her back under professional mental health care. She lived with me but spent a lot of time working with doctors, psychologists and various types of therapists to develop further. She wasn't growing to gain complete independence but that didn't mean she had no room for improvement. They helped her a lot. Last year she was able to get a simple part time job and she's held onto it until now, something our parents always believed is impossible. These past four years she's improved so much that she's a totally new person. She's still intellectually disabled and can't live independently but she's miles better than when she was with our parents, and miles happier.\n\nThis year I was able to obtain guardianship over her as that helps a lot with my involvement in her healthcare and finances. Before this, my parents always told me that I'm wasting my time with her. Now after they learned about the guardianship, they became incredibly upset and offended and they started to tell me how I stole my sister from them and I have no right to do what I'm doing and things like that. They've been trying to contact her to manipulate her I guess which I have so far blocked. This is all drama that my sister will not understand and does not need. But I suspect my parents aren't going to stop. They're some of the most stubborn people I've ever known.\n\nSo I guess I'm looking for advice as to how to deal with them without letting it affect my sister. \n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: I took my sister in and helped her develop. Now I have guardianship over her which made my parents lose their mind and they're trying to mess things up for her and me.",

            "Your parents are seeing you succeed where they failed as parents and they're externalizing it onto you, because you've now brought their failure to light. They see courts gave you the guardianship that they were denied as the fact that now *others* notice their failure as well, and this has made them unsettled.\n\nIt's a shame. You're such a great sister for stepping up. They should be proud of you. I suggest continue to block them and their access to your sister until they cool off. ",
            "First, what you are doing is awesome! Your sister deserves to be with someone who will support her and help her live up to her potential.\n\nSecond, if you truly believe contact with your parents can harm you sister, consider petitioning for a **no-contact order**. Your parents were denied continued custody for a reason. You have evidence you can take to the courts to prove that your parents failed to provide you sister adequate care. You were granted custody for a reason - you are the best thing for your sister. I believe a judge will support you. ",
            "Stole her? She is a human being, not a possession. That comment alone demonstrates why it's good your sister isn't still with them.",
            "What you've done is awesome. Keep your parents at bay like you have and continue to be as supportive as you are.",
            "First, laywer up. Second: do you have guardian of the person? or just guardian of property? Or both? If you are guardian of the person you have legal right to decide who your sister is allowed to socialize with. You can, legally, bar your parents from speaking to your sister without you being present (or form seeing her at all at all if you so wish)- see a lawyer about this to get the documents in order. \n\nYour parents attempting to speak with your sister behind your back is probably a first step to legally challenging your guardianship. They might see if they can try and trick your sister into saying something bad about you behind your back that can be used against you, or worse: or get her to sign a legal document where she requests a new guardian. A ward can request a new guardian at any time, for any reason, and the courts will take the request VERY seriously.\n\nIn the states I know of , anyone can challenge a person's guardianship, even if they're not related, and the courts have to take complaints like that seriously. If your parents file complaints against you, or challenge your guardianship, be prepared for a court hearing.\n\nYou should see if you can dig up court on why the courts refused to grant your parents guardianship, or at least have those court documents handy.\n\nCarefully document the improvements that your sibling has experienced since you've stepped in to as guardian (medical records, job history, extracurricular activities related to quality of life). Keep your nose clean and your accounting impeccable. These are usually the easiest place to make mistakes in guardianship, and often the first weak places an opponent looking to seize guardianship might attack.\n\nI'm getting a bad feeling about your parents and I agree with the poster that mentioned they were looking to collect her SSDI and let her rot in a corner for the rest of her life. There is no other rational explanation for their behavior. It is not jealousy or embarrassment, they are trying to sabotage a good thing for your sister for their own personal gain.",
            "I would try to reframe this with your folks. You're not trying to become a surrogate parent. It's not just that you've helped her develop. Your sister, developmentally delayed or not, is 23 years old. It's nothing against them -- or the millions of parents that experience this -- but people her age don't want to live with their parents. They probably wouldn't necessarily prefer to live with their siblings, either, but would choose living with a sibling over \"being coddled\" by parents. This is the hallmark of a very emotionally well-developed desire for independence. Moving in with you and getting a job? Those are incredible steps. It would be a step in the wrong direction if they deprived her of the choice to live with you as her guardian.",
            "You are awesome! As a fellow sib, I understand the difficulties we have in advocating for our siblings and sometimes having to challenge our parents. There are some excellent support groups out there- please take some time to look up the Sibling Leadership Network and also the SibNet Facebook group. Both are super help resources for siblings of individuals with intellectual disabilities. I've learned tons about guardianship, finance management, and other issues that sibs like us face as we get older and have more to do with the care of our siblings.  ",
            "What kind of mental health professionals is she working with and how did you get started with it?  I have a sister who is in a similar situation.  I think she could be able to be more independent than she currently is with the right help, but I have no idea what that would be or where to start. ",
            "You are being a wonderful sister and guardian, you should be very proud. Keep your parents at arm's length and make it clear that it is not up for discussion. You aren't 'stealing' your sister, you're helping her gain some independence. \n\nIf your sister were fully mentally proficient she would be becoming independent anyway - perhaps there's some 'empty nesting' going on here too. \n\nIf they contact your sister trying to influence her, I'd go low contact with them and remind them that she's doing well with you (basically keep doing what you're doing). If things get stressful for you I'd encourage you to consider therapy as a coping strategy. Best of luck!",
            "My immediate suspicion in this situation is that they think they can get money for taking care of her now.  Whatever it is that's motivating them though it is not the thought of what is best for your sister and that's all you need to know.  ",
            "I work as a community support professional for people with developmental disabilities (which is a fancy way of saying I provide care), and a main aspect of my job is helping the clients I work with gain and maintain autonomy in whatever way is possible for them.\n\nThere has been a lot of (mainly internal) drama at my job lately because the guy I work with the most is stuck in a situation where his growth as an individual is being completely stagnated by his parents. Perhaps not to the extreme of your parents, but certainly in a way that is inhibiting my guy's quality of life. They have guardianship over him, so there is only so much that staff can do to help him evolve socially. \n\nI bring that up simply to say that what you are doing is very admirable. You recognized the potential in your sister (something that I personally feel everyone has to some degree), and you took it upon yourself, at a fairly young age, to put your sister in a situation where she can do more than simply exist--she can be an individual, and she can thrive. \n\nThe importance of that cannot be understated. It is so easy to buy into the idea that there are limits to a person's growth, especially they're disabled in some way, to the point in which even parents give into it. You've seen it first hand, as have I. It is unfortunately uncommon to see someone stuck in that sort of situation and realize that it's a lack of opportunity, not a lack of ability, keeping them from growth.\n\nThis long-winded, somewhat self-gratifing rant (it's been rough at work lately, let me tell you) is all to say this: You don't owe your parents shit. \n\nYou're right in saying that it is a stress your sister doesn't need, but it's also a stress you don't need. Talk to them if you think it will help; check out your legal options in the likely event it falls to deaf ears. Your parents are jealous, and also probably pissed about the financial help from the government (which is stupid and petty of them), and they don't deserve to be in your lives if they aren't able to recognize that their daughters, both of them, are strong and capable adults.\n\nKeep doing what you're doing, and make sure you take care of yourself as well. You're a rad cookie. I hope things work out.",
            "We have a close family member with autism and we receive about $4k USD per month for his lodging and schooling.  We always helped him attend cool learning classes and teachers. We shuttle him around but mostly he likes to ride his BMX everywhere. Over the years he went from sometimes violent and unpredictable behavior to loving, intelligent and self reliant. He even cooks his own food. We have benefited a little over the years because the Government pays for up to $1800 of his rent and utilities which is about half of the mortgage. But we put all his money to stuff he likes to do and programs that really benefit him. Over the years we have had family members try to lure him away and this has created much stress. Especially since our motivation (especially his Mom) has been nothing but honorable and we never think of him as a paycheck.\n\nPoint is fight for your sister!

Sometimes you can get subsidies for being legal guarding for another adult (also tax breaks). Wondering if this could be a motive? Just curious. It could explain the jealousy and anger. ",
            "Parents can be flawed just like anybody, but it's a special kind of flaw not to realize when you're wrong.   they are continuing to do your sister a disservice by making it about them, which is damaging to her, damaging to you and gets nobody further towards helping her live the best life she can. \n\nI've seen a lot of good advice here, legal stuff, but once you have the legal backing you need to keep your sister safe in your care, I'd have a very direct discussion with your parents and convey that they've been selfish and narcissistic, and that you want them to be involved but you can't allow that until they get over themselves, or something like that.

            "You could perhaps explain to them that you are giving them the gift of having an adult relationship with their adult daughter, instead of the challenge of always being in a caretaker role. Give them an \"out.\" Let them know that you don't know what it was like to be in their position, and that you can't say for sure what you would have done if you had been her parent, but that you are her sister, and as her sister, you are able to allow her to take reasonable risks to reach her potential in a way that a more protective parent isn't always willing to do. Acknowledge to them that they did a great job of protecting her, and that you know that they love her. Tell them that you admire their tireless efforts to care for her, and that you know that it's always hard for parents to accept when their children need them less than they have before. \n\nIf you want your parents to have a positive relationship with her, and with you, change the tone of the disagreement to one where you aren't telling them that they sucked as parents, but that they did a great job raising her as a child, but now she's an adult, and there is no better person than a sister to provide challenges and age appropriate living experiences. \n\nI'm sure you know that the experience of raising a child with an intellectual disability is an extremely complicated and personal journey. They likely did what they believed was best at the time, based on the information that they had, and it is EXTREMELY hard for parents of adults with disabilities to step back and take a different, more subordinate role in their children's lives. Your sister deserves choice and self determination and dignity, which you are assisting her with. And your parents can now relax and form a new relationship with her; one where they enjoy time with her and respect her autonomy and privacy, but still have a role in her life.

            "I see many comments about legal stuff - this is probably the American way, to start with restraining orders and lawyers and stuff. \n\nThen I see comments about money, as your parents may have had financial benefit from your sister's disability, which they would have lost now. Still, if that was the case I would expect to have seen that in your question. They got upset after hearing about the guardianship. I can't tell if this involves money or not. It could very well be. \n\nAll this is useful and good to consider. \n\nYou not only have to handle your sister, but your parents as well. It's something you do, because you have to. They should support you, and praise you. Somehow they can't do this. They seem to be in denial to see what is best for you and your sister. \n\n**You need to find out why they react like this.** \n\nIs it money? Is it shame, that they see that they denied your sister proper support? Do they feel like you set your sister up against them? Even if this is not the case, and even if your sister is as glad to see her parents as always (assuming she did so), your parents can see any cue as prove that you set your sister up against her. This is not about logic, or about your understanding, it's how they feel, and logic may be something from another universe in this case. \n\nHow about family, aunts, grandparents, cousins, other brothers or sisters? Friends of the parents that you know as well, neighbours? What do they think? Can they explain this? Ask them, find out what this is about. \n\nYou are 29, your sister 23. I don't know if you live alone, have to handle this all by yourself. If your parents start to harress her, make it impossible for you to live your life, then legal action may be the way to go. But for now, that is definitely the last option. **Starting legal actions means another major burden on your life**, plus a real big fight with your parents and possibly the rest of the family. Don't start unless there is no other way.\n\n**Find professional support.** The therapists and doctors of your sister might give support to you as well. Your sister's wellness depends on you and your well being, as well on her relationship with your parents. If her therapists can't help you, they will know who can. You have to find a way out of here and restore the relationship with your parents. \n\nFor all you know, it might be something completely different. I just thought of a slumbering conflict between your parents, that was underlying all of this. Maybe one blaims the other for your sister. No logic here, just deep emotions about a lost future or something. This is pure speculation! But it wouldn't be the first time if some other problem exists here, that is not related to you taking over care of your sister. \n\n**Once again - you need to find out what really motivates your parents.** Shame is a big motivator. Finding a solution will make your life a lot easier. They could probably really help you out with many things if they turn their mind around. ",

She is an adult, intellectually disabled but still capable of making choices. She will need your guidance and support, but if she wants to have contact with her parents then that should be her choice to make too.\n\nIf you talk it over and she **doesn't** want contact with her parents, that'll also make your job of keeping them apart a whole lot easier.",

I've never had a thread on the front page of this sub before, so I'm sorry if I don't reply to everyone, but I am absolutely reading every comment because I am so grateful for outside perspective on my situation. Y'all are rad as hell.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI'm a rambler, but I'll try to keep it concise.\n\nMy partner (28M) and I want to be married, but we don't care much for the idea of having a wedding. We wanted to elope, but my mom has been telling me since I was sixteen (and had never even had a boyfriend) that she wanted to see me get married and she would basically never forgive me if I eloped. I do like the idea of my family being there to celebrate with us, but I hate the idea of spending money we don't have on this huge party just so that our relationship can change in nothing but name and legal benefits. And for various reasons, it doesn't make sense for us to wait until we can afford a wedding to get married.\n\nWe wanted to keep it small, preferably under $3,000 (which is honestly more than I'd like to spend, but we have to be realistic). We had planned on having it in my in-laws' backyard but even that was more money and effort than I was willing to put forth. I was stressed and feeling like I was out of options, so one day, I vented to my mom. She seemed really excited about the idea of helping me plan a wedding. It was kind of a red flag when she said, \"My mom didn't help me plan my wedding. Let me live vicariously through you.\" But still, I agreed. She seemed really excited to help me find a venue. I was not excited, because I have not been excited about one single step in the wedding process and I just want it to be over. (Maybe it's supposed to be fun if you have money? IDK.)\n\nAbout a week later, I found out that this really great park in our city (that my partner LOVES) does weddings for an extremely small fee. I emailed the event coordinator and found out that the date we want is available. I told my mom, and her reaction was, \"So I guess you don't need my help finding a place, then?\" And every time I talk about it, she says the same thing. She has always talked about how shitty it is to guilt trip someone, but I feel like that's exactly what she's trying to do.\n\nI honestly can't tell whether or not I've done something wrong? Like, I'm not sure if I implied that I would only get married in a place she helped me find? I don't feel like trying to take action on my own wedding is that great of an offense, but I can tell she's upset. I want to make her feel better, but at the same time, I don't want to change our plans again just so that she can feel involved. Am I in the wrong? If I am, what should I do to make it better?\n\n**TL;DR My mom wanted to help me plan my wedding, but I found a venue on my own before we could start. She seems upset about it. Was I in the wrong, and if so, how do I make it better?**",

If this doesn't work, perhaps have a conversation about what she exactly wanted from her mother and what she actually wants to offer you. Support is not the same as planning for others.\n\nIs your mother married, btw? She can marry the same guy again if she is and plan her own wedding with her wishes.

She can find your wedding shoes or veil or garter or whatever things you can send her looking for. \n\nMaybe like, \"My veil must have amethysts sewn in and heirloom lace.\"?? That'll work for a few weeks a least. The \"living vicariously\" through you could be trying to bond or it could be overbearing. Hoping for the former. \n\nHave your lovely park wedding.

            "It sounds like there is some personal history your mom is going through. I do not think her reaction is meant for you if she is normally a decent, level-headed woman.\n\nIf this is abnormal behavior, a conversation on how you feel is needed. Specifically: financial constraints, your actual desires for the wedding (explain what you actually wanted and your compromising limit on how big it is), and specific ways she can help if you want her help (it sounds like you are fine with her helping). The goal with this conversation is to bridge her back into the reality that this is your wedding, these are the actual ways to help, and these are the constraints.\n\nIf this is very abnormal behavior, I would also ask why she is behaving that way. Include specific actions she has done in this format: \"I feel [emotion] when you do [her action]. I would prefer [how you want her to act]. Can we please discuss how we can achieve [desired reaction]?\" Do not use this if this normal behavior. It will likely not help.\n\nIf this is normal behavior, you might be out of luck. Do your wedding your way and don't worry because if this is her normal, she will more than likely be upset no matter what you do. I would also be inclined to just elope if I were in your shoes if this is normal. She will probably just make planning and the wedding worse. Since you already seem unsure about the cost and stressed about planning, her behavior will make the wedding definitely not worth it.",

That is the only way you will have the wedding you want, and preserve your relationship with your mom.",
            "You can do a City Hall wedding (they allow people in the room with you, so she can be there), and then just have a party afterwards, get some catering, backyard thing, or rent a venue and have a party. You really don't need to fall into the Marriage Industrial Complex's trap and waste a bunch of money... your day can be special without all that. Just let your mother know that she will be there at your wedding so she can see you get married, you won't \"elope\" without her, but this is YOUR day, not hers (delineate that clearly).",

            "My wife\u2019s mother had similar requests for our wedding last year... some advice...\n\nSet expectations early. \n\nLet her know that she can attend meetings with your wedding coordinator, vendors, etc. but that this is your wedding and you and your partner will be making all of the decisions. \n\nLet her know you would like her input along the way, and will consider her opinions, but your decisions may not (or ever) be in line with her opinions. \n\nDelegate some decisions to her on things you don\u2019t really wish to be tied up with. It will give her a buggier sense of involvement if she\u2019s allowed to make some decisions.\n\nBy the way, don\u2019t feel obligated to have a wedding just because your mother didn\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019ve been married twice... I will say this. Weddings are fun, but they are also a very large waste of money. \n\nTake the money you would spend on a wedding and use it towards a down payment on a house. Go on a vacation.

            "Okay, so I had a similar thing happen with my mom. I'm going to urge you to tread carefully because she and I had some rifts during my wedding planning that never really healed (and this was 15 years ago and I'm actually divorced now). My mom really wanted to help (she hadn't been able to help my older sister because they were getting married at my sister's in-laws', and my mom and I have a closer relationship anyway). I didn't understand that she really wanted to involved in so much of this. I was like you in wanting it to be affordable and low-key; my dress wasn't white and we had the ceremony on the deck of a privately owned home with a small group of people followed by a nice restaurant lunch, and then we had a bigger, casual party at a local park in the afternoon. My mom got upset about so many things: when I told her someone else had volunteered to help, she was offended and hurt, not excited; she was really upset with how I decided to do the flowers. I suspect your mom is disappointed that she's not full involved in the decisions from the start. I'm not saying she should be. She probably has a fantasy vision of your wedding and the involvement and role she wants in it (maybe she's picturing a beloved mother of the bride role?). Her vision was quite different from mine. \n\nIn the bigger picture, I think what was really going on with my mom is that she was feeling a bit sad, in a way, about me getting married. She liked the guy I was marrying, but at that point, my sister and my dad (her ex-husband) were both married. My mom and I had always been close, and I think she felt like she was losing me to marriage, in a way, and she was sad that she was the only one of the four of us without a partner. \n\nSo, it wasn't really about the wedding, but the wedding was bringing up these issues from long ago (she was having a lot of stress about my dad and stepmom being there, I know). I think she felt pushed aside or something.\n\nI don't know what to suggest, exactly... but I did read some of your follow-ups and the comment your partner made about why you got him a class of water and not her... that was kinda mean and also a bit sexist. You said he responded as a joke, but are you sure it was a joke? Like, it's not your job to take care of your mother or your husband and now that you're engaged he comes first. I'm not saying she handled it well. If you were feeling thoughtful, you could have gotten a drink for all three of you... you said you prioritized your boyfriend but in that case, you could have done something nice for both of them. Like, were you not thinking about your mom's drink or were you trying to make a point that you didn't have to consider her needs? I would hope you're not always the one in the service role, you know? Also, your boyfriend could have hopped up and gotten her a drink at that point. That would have been a good move on his part. \n\nSo, I think what's going on is that there are some tough issues between you and your mom, and a wedding is the kind of thing that exacerbates this stuff. Have you spent any time in therapy working on this stuff about your mom? It might help you to have better boundaries with her and figure out what to do. Wedding planning and a new marriage can be stressful too.",
            "What if you did these 3 things:\n\n1. Get married at the courthouse with just mom and BF's parents present as witnesses. They get to be part of an intimate moment and feel special.\n\n2. Have an awesome reception / BBQ / party at the park that is casual picnic wear, and open to all including kids so no one has to get a babysitter. Have brauts and burgers and maybe a fun band. Can play silly games or whatever.\n\n3. Have a fund for a honeymoon in Tahoe instead of a registry / presents.",
            "This won't solve everything, but one thing that helped me was giving my mom one task I didn't care about. In my case,  it was the cake.

If you are still paying for whatever item you choose, definitely give her a budget",
            "Do not let your mother dictate your life as a married couple or she will think she can tell you what to do throughout your whole marriage. Tell her you appreciate her wanting to help but to be honest it's your and your partners day. It is about what yall want not your mother. Go elope and get it over with. \nSo many couples start out their life together in debt just to have a big fancy wedding that you hardly remember because to be honest it's a crazy day. My 1st marriage the wedding cost almost 20k that's alot to a nuke collar cowboy and that marriage only lasted 4 years we were still paying it off when we divorced. My second marriage we went to Vegas cost about 4k and were going on 19 years we really enjoyed our little Vegas ceremony and honeymoon all in one. I would reccomended it highly. Now what we did for family was after we were married and paid off the Vegas trip we had a Reception so that family and friends could come celebrate with us. We played the video of our ceremony in the beginning and then did dinner dancing and wedding cake. It was so much more enjoyable than a big wedding and then a reception following that costs way too much money. \n   You need to do what makes you and your man happy and you need to put mom in her place really fast or she will try to tell you what to do for the rest of your married life.  Wait till shes trying to tell you how to raise your kids and how to keep your own home clean. \nGood luck and I hope you do what makes you happy",

She isn't helping if you don't get to decide how YOUR WEDDING is going to go.\n\nAt the very LEAST let her know that if she wants to pick out everything SHE'S PAYING FOR IT, NOT YOU.\n\nPersonally I don't like feeling like someone else's puppet - you're not a baby doll, you're a grown woman.\n\nI'm having this kind of situation right now too, except my husband and I are already married. We were going to go to the courthouse and do it there but my MIL insisted that we could have it at the house with an LDS bishop she knew. That was supposed to be it. We were going to plan a wedding later. (The main reason was because my husband wanted his brother to be his best man but he was out of state.)\n\nBut my MIL got a cake, and decorated the house, and _invited_ people. With three days notice. So in my opinion, THAT was our wedding. She's still trying to get us to do a big reception, and every time plans come up she promises they'll pay for everything and then she changes her mind a few weeks later. It's infuriating. So nothing has happened. I told them from now on, I'm hands off. I don't want to make any of these decisions, we can't afford the stuff she mentions. _I just wanted to meet the family._ If it happens, it happens. Whatever. (We've been married a year and a half now.)\n\nAnyways circling back to your problem, this is not, and will never be, your mom's wedding. It's not the important thing here. Sorry she didn't get the wedding of her dreams, but I mean, that isn't your fault and you don't have to pay for it. If I were you, I'd probably go to the courthouse. Get married how you want. She's making a big deal over something that happened to her without giving two craps about how it's making you (uhm the _BRIDE_) feel. Not cool.",

You could just tell her youve got it and d9nt want her help at all. \n\nHowever you could also do something like have her coordinate the detail parts. Can she be like, the supervisor? If anything is being delivered or picked up can she handle those tasks? The actual nitty gritty of throwing a wedding? Do you need things like a gift bag for people who are coming in from out of town? Have tour mom go around and collect business carda for salons and restaurants and print off maps of the locations with directions, put them in a small gift bag with some favors like candies or local chocolates or booze or whatever (ive seen people do lotion samples or eye masks or little bottles of maple syrup etc...) You can label them and have the hotel hand them out at check in (as long as the front desk staff is cool with it.) Or if youre making any at home decor for the tables can she handle that? \n\nKeep her busy, but help yourself out basically is the idea. Maybe make a list of what is left with your SO and see what your mom could take care of?",

Almost 15 years later, she still calls it the most fun wedding she\u2019s ever been to. \n\nAll that to say, stick to your guns and plan the wedding you actually want. She\u2019ll get over it or she won\u2019t, but it\u2019s not your problem. Frankly, based on your other comments, it sounds like she\u2019ll have something to be salty about no matter what.

We spent about 8,000 for a ~100 person wedding and reception with food and alcohol during off-season (summer in FL, inside of course). But we like parties, like our families, and I love planning things. My husband even likes some planning. It didn't stress us out as much as it excited us.\n\nBut if planning and having the event is not your and your finance's thing, why do it to make someone else happy? Do what makes you happy. It's your money. If your mom wants to bond with you, there are other ways to do so than having a $3,000 party. And it always ends up costing more than you think it will.\n\nWe spent less on our honeymoon and got 10 days of joy out of it vs. one day of joy on our wedding day. In other words, joy from our honeymoon was more cost effective.\n\nBtw, since you live in FL, I highly recommend a honeymoon cruise. People elsewhere have to pay for flights across the country, but we can just drive to Ft. Lauderdale. My husband can get a bit motion sick on boats, but the cruise ship was so large that it didn't move enough to make him sick. We had amazing food (Royal Caribbean) included, didn't have to clean, didn't have to drive, could drink without needing a DD, and if we got tired, our bed was a short walk away and we could order free room service.

Expect and know that it will be stressful at times but try to stay focused on her good intentions and remember that it\u2019s not just for you, it\u2019s also for your mom. :) \nGood luck! In a few months, it will all be over anyways.",
            "Let her handle one aspect. Give her a budget and let her have it. Flowers, music, whatever.",
            "If she's paying for, take whatever you can get.",
            "Keep in mind that a lot of people will give you money as a gift. For my wedding, it paid for itself especially if you don\u2019t have a registry people know that you want money. Don\u2019t worry about the expense just have fun and celebrate with your family and friends who love you.",
            "God forbid your mother gave birth to you, wants to see you married in a ceremony, and help plan the wedding. Once she passes you will regret it. Let her play a part in it if you have already decided to go with a ceremony. It will make her happy - if you care about your mom."
