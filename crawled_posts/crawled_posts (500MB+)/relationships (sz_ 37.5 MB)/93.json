I know it's been quite some time, but a lot has happened and it finally calmed down enough that I could find the time to post.\n\nGood news, husband's mom is now in an appropriate home. We were able to find a place about an hour drive from where we live that was $7k a month and that had pretty great reviews. We obviously toured it first and talked to the staff and asked extensively about activities, cleaning schedules, food, etc. Mother-in-law was moved in this week. We were really lucky, because of our location there wasn't a long waiting list and there were several openings this month alone. It also helped we had a strong referral from her long time physician (the one who actually told us about this place to begin with).\n\nSo basically what happened after that post-\n\nI called Mike and told him we needed to talk when he got home. When he got in we sat in my study and I laid it out for him. I told him exactly how I felt about the situation, told him it was enough. I showed him some printouts of information I had on Alzheimer units surrounding us, even articles on coping with having a parent going through this. \n\nLong story short- we got into an argument. He accused me of being unsupportive, being selfish, etc. I refused to take it. I have been the one to stay home and babysit his increasingly sick mother all day, not him. I told him that and that if he was so dedicated to having her stay in the house, *he* could be the one to take care of her. I was at the absolute limit. \n\nI packed a bag and checked myself into one of the nicer hotels. I went out and bought some bath bombs and wine and for the first time in a long time I just had time for me. I was able to sit on my laptop and actually get ahead on my work. He was of course texting me and calling but it was just to continue his tirade, which I could happily ignore for the time being. I knew that he would soon be seeing things in a much different light.\n\nIt seriously took only two days. He begged me to come home. He told me he was sorry and that he didn't know just how bad it was. I told him he'd have to do better than that and to actually take her to the doctors and get that referral so we could have her moved to long-term care ASAP. Make an appointment at a home. Start prepping her for the move. Until then, I wasn't checking out of my newly found peace and quiet.\n\nHe actually came through. Her physician, a really really great guy btw who also had a parent go through this, got us fast tracked for this place. I think that paired with Mike seeing his moms actions really helped to open his eyes to the reality of the situation. She wasn't just \"a little off\". She was actually a danger to herself. \n\nI also talked to my husband about getting therapy. I told him it would be normal to have feelings of guilt or sadness over this and that I thought he should take the time to see someone. I offered to go with him if he wanted me to be there. He said he would think about it and I decided not to push it. I will take it up with him again though if I see he's not doing well because of it.\n\nHe cried a lot the day we had to take her in. When we got home we had a long talk about how he felt and he told me he was sorry he said I was selfish or uncaring. He said he realized how much I must have cared to do that for him for 3 months. I told him it doesn't mean someone doesn't care when they have to just admit they can't handle something. There are professionals for a reason, we're just not them. \n\nSo that's where we're at right now. This week is more about everything settling down, him getting used to his mom being away, me getting the house back to normal and getting back into routine. I've left her belongings in the room she was occupying so he could still have that piece of her and we could bring things to her as necessary. They gave us a list of clothing items needed, but it was mostly comfortable housewear like pjs and slippers and since it's not winter yet nothing bulky like sweaters or coats. I had to have the mattress replaced in her room though because she had wet the bed often and not said anything so it was destroyed. I cleaned up her bathroom and just tidied the room up in general so it was livable again. \n\nI want to say thanks to everyone who weighed in. So much good advice and words I much needed to hear in that original thread. Thank you to everyone who shared their personal story and gave their suggestions on how to help husband cope. Hopefully from here on out things can be a lot more stable. It's definitely not easy and I wish that in a perfect world none of this would have to be happening, but it already feels so much better this way. \n\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: My husband finally saw the light and we moved his mom to an appropriate Alzheimer unit where she will get the assistance she needs. Husband and I reconciled, I am making sure to be very supportive of him during this hard time. I put the option of therapy out there for him, but will let him decide on his own. Thank you all so much for your help. ",

I can't tell you how many residents I have that have only a few nightgowns or other pajamas items. Seriously, if her laundry is done at the facility and she runs out, she'll need to wear the Johnny's the facility has. They usually are about 10 sizes too big and are not warm.",
            "It's so hard to explain to people who see someone with Alzhimers for a few hours on a \"good day\" what it's like living with them 24/7. I get so annoyed when I see Alzhimers portrayed as just being forgetful or like permanent amnesia, and not the 90 minute screaming session in the middle of the night, the eating non-edible things. It really takes a whole team to take care of someone in that situation, glad your husband (finally) made the right choice. ",

            "I commented on your first post (wrote a novel, basically!) confirming that it was dangerous and neglectful for her to not have 24 hour care. I'm so glad things worked out!

Sometimes that's all it takes for him to realize just how bad the situation was! ",

            "It must be frustrating that he had to take it on himself to realize how it was instead of just listening. If it makes you feel better, I think this is pretty common. I took care of someone once, not even 24/7 and I had to quit my job, and I currently work with animals that often have to go home to constant care. Many people hear \"incontinent\" and figure they'll need to give baths once a day, or \"non ambulatory\" and they think they'll just carry fido in and out and that's the end of it. They don't realize I mean 24/7 covered in urine or fecal matter and flailing around in it. Unless your a stay at home/retired person with the patience of a saint it's just not doable. The time I took care of a person also made me realize the mentally compromised present a unique challenge of sometimes being pretty belligerent. It's hard enough to clean up someone's waste, but also while yelling at you? Rough stuff.\n\nGood on you for getting her into a facility. They may not always get the treatment you'd \"like\" them to, but they'll actually get worlds better care then most people can provide on their own. ",
            "Just a word of caution. Make sure for the first few months that you are checking in early and often. Lots of these homes (even expensive ones) put on a good song and dance for the families but are actually not very good places. Having worked in EMS for years in several states I have been in hundreds of these places. Id say I would trust about 10% of them to care for my loved ones. Even if they aren't actively malicious, many are under-staffed or under-trained. So just saying to make sure she is actually getting the care she needs long-term.",

Plus the amount of work involved in taking care of the house and him at the same time, even with hospice and a home aide, was brutal. Helpless as a baby all day long but as soon as the sun went down he would start trashing the house. I had to hire a sitter so I could sleep at night.",

            "Thanks for the update OP. My MIL died (in their home country) of frontal lobe dementia before I ever met her. Saw her for the first time in her casket which was... well whatever. Anyway, I was worried for the longest time thinking my husband would forever regret not seeing her when she was still somewhat lucid. And feel horribly guilty for not getting to say goodbye. But one day he quietly told me that he was relieved she was no longer suffering as a prisoner in her own mind. And that he didn't watch her rapidly (her dementia took its course within 6 years in her early 50s) turn into an unrecognizable person. And even worse, to know in her rare moments of clarity that she would just wail because she realized what was going on. She still couldnt speak but would look around in panic and then just cry herself into a stupor. It definitely scarred my FIL and I dont think he'll ever be quite right. This shit is not easy and I really hand it to you for sticking up for the right thing. She needs skilled care, and activities to do. And safety. I'm so happy that things worked out and wish you guys the best!",
            "I'm glad your husband saw the light. When my parents first moved to our province, they were driving down the road and found a little old lady walking down the side of the road, barefoot and in a thin nightgown, it was December. She was carrying her purse and after getting her to sit in their car with the heater on, my father was able to find a number to her daughter, who happened to be across the country, via payphone, they finally reached the daughter. Her mother had advanced dementia and had just been moved to a new care home, she had wandered off. They drove her back to the facility, and that was that. This is something I suggest you take precautions for. Put your phone number on a card in her wallet/purse/jacket, just in case.",

Her fists are balled up so tight they need to put gauze between her fingers and palm because she was cutting her hand with her own finger nails. Her muscles are constantly in contraction so she's basically doing sit-ups in her wheel chair non-stop. Her ability to eat will be next.\n\nIt took some serious conversations with my dad to get him to realize she needed 24 hour medical care in a hospital. She needed to leave her home.

            "I am glad you forced your husband to take care of her. It may have suited him to just keep her like a well loved item  but a specialized  home really is for the best in most circumstances. People who work in homes get to step away each day, people who try to do it at home never get a break. That sort of situation takes its toll within days. Even with help you are constantly surrounded by it, it is with you 24/7. I can understand his disappointment and sadness but he did the right thing by letting her go. ",
            "Im glad you did this-I got down voted and reprimanded for advising you to do this if he didn't get it after another talk.

            "My grandmother is in the very early stages of Alzheimer's. She's not at this stage yet, but becoming more and more difficult for her to live alone, and she has no idea what to do with herself when she periodically stays with us. For a woman who's in perfect physical shape and has been fiercely independent all her life, seeing that change is fucking brutal. \n\nPoint is, I feel for your husband. It's hard to see someone who helped raise you slowly become incapable of even the most basic of tasks, and it's hard to let go of even the slightest hope that they'll make some miracle recovery, or that whatever medical trial or medicine they're on will finally be the miracle cure. \n\nIt's devastating, and it gets worse and worse and worse. You made the right call getting her somewhere that can take proper, professional care of her, but as someone who's going through this right now too, I seriously recommend your husband try therapy. He's watching his mother wither away in front of him, and there's no way to get around that. ",
            "Damn lady, you are badass. Good for you for showing your husband in the most effective way possible, and for listening to what people told you in your original post (I see so many posts where people ask for advice then refuse to take it).\n\n",

            "You did a very hard thing. I know it was hard for you to make your husband see what was happening, and it was even harder for him to admit his mother was in such bad shape. But, as you said, there are professionals for this, and you knew that you would not survive being her caretaker. There is absolutely no shame in this, and kudos to you for being adult enough to admit it and seek to get her the care she deserves. You probably saved your marriage and you most certainly saved your mental health.\n\nI do recommend that you both get couples counseling. Although your marriage may be on the mend, this still put a stain on it and it will be helpful to have a 3rd party walk you through repairing it together. I also strongly urge your husband to get into counseling regardless if \"he is coping\". Having a parent with a mental illness, especially one like this can really mess you up. \n\nAs far as your MIL, I do agree, please bring her some other clothing and a few non-valuable baubles and trappings. When she has moments of clarity, she will want to resemble her former self as much as possible, and her things will bring her comfort. Also, visit her as much as you can now while she is still somewhat lucid. Make sure your husband cherishes this time with her, as the day is soon coming where she won't remember him, and it will break his heart and yours. \n\nReading your last post, she doesn't sound like she is too far along. I know that might seem crazy considering how she was when she was living with you, but it is only going to get worse. It is good that you made the right choice to get her professional help now so there is a familiarity with the workers there for her. It will help ease her life in the coming years. And again, visit her. Make sure she is being cared for with love. \n\nI wish you well dear. I hope that your marriage can heal from this, and you and your husband can move forward. I hope your MIL's quality of care is always good, and she is well cared for and as happy as she is able to be. ",

In the last 5 months of his life, the cancer hit his brain and he essentially lost his mind. I cared for him from the initial diagnosis and gave up work to be there for him. Before he went into a nursing home, he lived in a bed in the living room of the house. Before he was discharged from hospital, it was his wish to be at home and spend his last few months with the family. Of course I respected his wishes. He was home for maybe 5 days before I was begging the Dr for him to go into a home. At this point he couldn't walk. He was talking to himself, taking gibberish to me....he was so confused that he would do really random things like try to change the TV channel with his glasses case, if the phone rang he would shout for me to turn my music off etc. He would soil the bed repeatedly and then get upset that he had done it....it was the most difficult thing to witness and cope with. I had reached my breaking point and I knew that I just couldn't give him the help he needed. I felt so upset and gutted that I asked for him to be in a nursing home as he wanted to stay in the house but I just couldn't do it anymore. Watching a loved one suffer and not be able to help in all the right ways is soul destroying and so, so challenging. \nThe staff at the home were so amazing with him and although he was in a huge state of confusion, he would have a few lucid moments and would say he loved his new room and didn't want to leave!\nAlthough he didn't have his wish to die at home, he died in the next best place. And he had me there with him when he passed. \nPlease don't ever beat yourself up or feel guilty for putting Mum in a home.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'm back. I can't say this update is an uplifting one, but I think it's okay for what it is, and what happened. [Original is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7fg9gw/my_moms_61f_grieving_for_my_sister_29f_makes_me/)\n\nHere's the old summary: My mom won't let us do family traditions after my sister's passing, and I'm worried she may not be doing other things. How can I get her to start feeling better and recovering?\n\nAnyways, on my mom's last day in town, I took her to the cemetery where Diana is buried, since it was just more practical for her to be buried near to us. She didn't want to go through the gate, because she'd never visited the grave. Even when the funeral was held, she didn't want to go because she didn't want it to be real. I waited for her for about thirty minutes, then decided to go on without her so I could at least see Diana's grave. After another thirty minutes, my mom came and joined me. She started sobbing that it wasn't real, that it was all a bad dream.\n\nI just sat there and let her cry. I'd watched Diana die- I knew it was real. So, I just let her try and understand what I knew all along. It made me feel like a robot. I felt even worse when I looked at her headstone, and just felt nothing. Obviously, I miss and love my sister, but I just didn't feel *sad*. It just felt like looking at a stranger's headstone, and thinking, \"Hey, we have the same last name.\"\n\nMy mom eventually wore herself out, and just hugged the headstone and sat there, sniffling. I got up and started to look around, checking out the other gravestones. I have no idea what happened, but I was staring at a headstone, and doing some mental math to find out how old the person was. They were thirty. All of a sudden, I just started bawling. I was thinking about how excited my sister was to turn thirty, and I realized she would never get to turn thirty. I sat in front of a total stranger's headstone, and cried like a baby.\n\nEventually, I managed to get back to my mom, and we held each other for a while and cried together. She told me she loved me, and I told her I loved her. We just stood there for a long time, then my mom told me she wanted me to have \"my moment\" with my sister, and went off to a different part of the cemetery. I sat with the headstone for a while, and just started talking about my life. I talked about my job, my lack of success on Tinder, how badly I wanted a cat but my apartment complex didn't let us have animals. I kept waiting for her to tease me, or tell me I was being ridiculous, but she didn't say anything, and I just broke down in tears every time I finished a sentence.\n\nI went to find my mom after sitting there for about forty-five minutes. We went to go get breakfast at a nearby diner. I asked my mom what she was doing since Diana died. She said she'd been going to her counselor, but also found a local group of grieving parents who do a group therapy thing. I asked if she had hobbies outside of Diana. She said that she did what she did before Diana died, and I asked her to do something like scrapbooking, or cooking, or just take a class. I even offered to pay, and that snapped my mom out of it pretty quickly- she swatted at me and told me not to pay for her.\n\nOnce she got home, she signed up for a meditation class, and at my request- also started taking an art class at her local rec center. I like to think she's doing a bit better. The other day, she sent me a picture of me and Diana from the day she moved out. It was really sweet, and I asked her to send me a physical copy so I could frame it. I think I'm also doing better. I visited Diana last night, and I felt really good. I brought her some flowers, and I just stayed and chatted for a little bit.\n\nI got myself into a grief handling program, and I'm excited to attend my first group therapy session. This festered in me for a long time, and I let myself believe I was okay because we didn't have a \"real bond.\" But we did, and I loved her, and I've been trying to heal in a way that was just... Going through the motions. I had to let my world stop turning for a while, and experience it like my mother did.\n\nBefore that visit to the cemetery, I would cook for myself every night. Since then, I've been going through frozen meals like crazy. I would shower everyday, make sure I curled my hair every morning, wore matching socks even if my boots were too high for anyone to see. Now, I let my hair get kind of gross and let it stay straight for a while. I drag whatever socks I can get out of my dryer. I let myself be sad, and gross, and ugly, and unfortunate. I eat lunch by myself at work somedays, and hide in the bathroom when I feel grief coming on. I've ripped the band-aid off, and am letting all the bacteria and ick get into the cut before I pour hydrogen peroxide in it and let it really be fixed. \n\nIt's bedtime for me now, but thank you to everyone who reached out and commented and was kind. And to the people who weren't, thanks for still taking time out of your day.\n\nTLDR: My mom and I had a catharsis moment at my sister's grave, and have been slowly healing and rebuilding ourselves. We're doing okay, and are slowly getting back to being happy and normal.",

            "Hi, I know I'm not going through exactly what you're going through, but last month, I lost my boyfriend suddenly. He was 25.\n\nAll throughout the next few days, through the private visitation, the dinners with his family, the funeral, etc. I was weirdly stoic. I mean, I definitely cried, but it wasn't all the time. At his funeral I barely cried at all. Looking at his body didn't even feel real - it felt like it was a weird wax dummy of him or something. I kept waiting for him to pop out of somewhere and start making jokes about the whole situation (as was his nature). As his girlfriend and probably the closest person to him at the time of his death, I almost felt like I was playing \"hostess\", having to greet everybody and saying \"thank you for being here, it means so much to myself and his family\" over and over again.\n\nNow, it's been a little over a month since he passed. And I mean, I bawl. Like a lot. All the time. I cried while I was making pancakes this morning and my eyes got so blurry I couldn't see to flip them properly in the pan lol. And the littlest, innocuous things \"trigger\" me - a photo, a sunset, a glass of water, Poptarts, you name it lol.\n\nI look at his Facebook and all of his photos and read all of the messages on his wall every day. I also look at all the phones and videos on my phone every day. I changed my lockscreen and background to two different photos of him. And I write my diary entries as letters addressed to him.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I really know what you're going through. After the initial shock wears off, it's like you didn't even know your body had the capacity for this much sadness, or the ability to cry so freaking much.\n\nBut it's ok. \n\nEverybody always looks kind of freaked out or upset when they see me crying about what happened. But honestly, in this weird cathartic way, it feels so good. It feels so good to just think about him and let it all out. And a lot of times I end up feeling just so fortunate to have ever known him, and so grateful for life in general, as strange as that sounds. I'm almost *grateful* to cry because that means that I loved him so much that my body really feels and expresses it.\n\nAnyway...I don't know if this will help you at all but I had to share my story. I really relate to you and I hope that dealing with this gets easier with the passage of time. Good luck to you <3\n\nEdit: I just want to thank everyone for your kind responses, it\u2019s been amazing and I never expected this comment to blow up so much. Thank you whoever gave me gold! And thank you all for leaving your condolences and sharing your stories with me. I hope we can all heal together \u2764\ufe0f",
            "I remember your post. It sounds like you and your mom have reconciled a few things surrounding your sisters passing. \n\nI know ripping the bandaid is painful but this Internet stranger is proud of you for having your sad days and dirty hair and mis-matched socks. \n\nDon\u2019t ever forget that *you\u2019re entitled to be sad* and grieve for your sister and your relationships and *its absolutely ok* if some days, you don\u2019t have the spoons to take the shower or do your hair. That\u2019s part of grief. And sometimes letting things just go for a moment to cry or sleep or practice some self-care and actually **grieve** is healthy.\n\nPlease take care. \u2764\ufe0f",

            "> As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\n\nSource: [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hax0t/my_friend_just_died_i_dont_know_what_to_do/c1u0rx2/) comment by /u/GSnow ",

            "This is rough. My husband's best friend was murdered four years ago  at 26 and his mother suffered a deep, deep depression for several years. Her husband and other two sons absolutely couldn't pull her out of it. We try to visit with them once a year (like family) and this year, the most incredible thing had happened. Her husband had suffered a stroke and, with a very thin chance, ended up pulling through. She was like a completely different person and explained it as a wake up call to stop making herself suffer in misery. Obviously, I hope this does not happen to your family, but what I mean by sharing this story is that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. It took her several years and a brush with death to see it, but she did. If you had asked me this two years ago, I would've thought she'd never smile again. ",

            "It's been almost 11 months now since I lost my Gran. She was this amazing second mother to me (a lot of my life a first mother vs. second) and we were absolutely bonded my whole life. We were inseparable. If you saw her, chances are you saw me. \n\nIt still haunts me that she told me \"I can't breathe\" as I rushed to get her more morphine while her body filled with fluid from her failed kidneys. She said she was in no pain but I can't imagine how she felt. I still feel gross about myself losing it and having to go to the other room to bawl and the hospice nurse having to help. I still feel guilty for not being able to take away any type of suffering. All of this has been a burden on my mind but I hope and pray she's at peace.\n\nI used to be able to feel my deceased family with me. My grandfather passed when I was 13 and I could always feel his presence... I can't anymore. I don't feel anyone... I'm just numb. My faith in God was lost but is getting better. Nothing is the same anymore.\n\nI found the pillow she had for a long time. I forgot I even kept it but it was in the spare room where my mom stayed when she came to help me clean out the house earlier this year. It was one of those memory foam ones to help cradle your neck and my husband was packing stuff (we're moving) and asked where it came from. I immediately knew whose it was and had to smell it.... strange, I know, but it smelled just like her. I just sat there, hugging this pillow, and crying. I bawled for a good two minutes while he just held me. \n\nIt's stupid things sometimes, but it's part of the grieving process. It's difficult some days. I recently cut my hair again because I just can't do much with it anyway, but also because I'm trying to get back in to the swing of taking care of myself. It's the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.",

When everyone else is getting on with their lives you (and your mum) can feel left behind in a black hole.\nEven my dog used to sit at the door waiting for dad to come home every afternoon for weeks after he died.\nYour Mum will get better but she will probably never really get over the loss of her daughter at such a young age. Just love her and be there when she needs to talk. \nDon\u2019t play down your own grief for your mums sake, she understands you are hurting too, it doesn\u2019t hurt to get grief counselling if you feel the need.\nThere\u2019s no easy answer, only time to dull the pain.\nI\u2019m so sad for your Mum and you, you sound like a wonderful person and daughter. \n",

He neglected to mention how he fucked several people before me, and I was at least six months in when he finally told me. I had to go back to my doctor as soon as I could and tell her. Luckily, nothing was wrong and I have a beautiful boy, but if he got something and gave it to her...well, the baby could be at risk. That's not something she deserves for him being a sack of shite. \n\nPlease, please tell her so her doctor can be on the lookout for that kind of stuff.",

Hire a lawyer, tell your wife that you are getting divorced, tell her why, and say that you want to keep things \"quiet and amicable\". Then, quietly and amicably push for a somewhat better deal than what your lawyer says you could realistically expect from the court system.  If your wife does not quietly and amicably go along, do not make threats but remind her of how bad her behavior was and make it very clear that you are not happy.  \n\nThis is how rich people fight.

How come you didn't break up with her?\n\nI know a lot of people break up over this and only a few situations when two people actually stay together after one has cheated.",

            "Fascinating topic, and a conversation I've been having with my gf as we get more serious. Our earnings are similar to yours, OP. I think that 50/50 is only fair if standards are set to the lowest common denominator. Once you get beyond that, the logic leads inevitably to a different ratio split, though not necessarily the precise same ratio as earnings.\n\nLet's say a sensible rent is 30% of gross wages. At 25k, that's an upper limit of 15k a year, assuming the lower earner is paying 50%. This is obviously only 10% for the higher earner (7.5k from 75k). There is nowhere for the lower earner in this scenario to go. The higher earner could use the same rule of thumb and justify a rent contribution of 22.5k alone. Even splitting that 50/50 would be potentially ruinous for the low earner.\n\nFurther, it's not really reasonable for the lower earner to push any higher at all. Why should they bust their budget? If the higher earner wants to live somewhere closer to what they could afford alone, they need to, and can comfortably, contribute _all_ the extra. At least it would cost them less than if alone. A 22.5k place is actually 15k now, at a 1:2 ratio rather than the 1:3 for earnings). I think it's better to see this as a saving for the higher earner than gold digging from the lower earner, as another reply has suggested.\n\nIt's not that equity is better than equality per se. It's just that equality has a limit for anything shared. To exceed that limit, equity is needed. Even then, equity leads to a better outcome for both parties than going it alone. One has a better place than could have been hoped before, the other pays less for the place they still might otherwise have.\n\nPersonally, I think going further to the ratio of earnings split is even better. The \"saving\" for the higher earner means less to them that the same %age reduction for the lower earner. I don't mean emotionally, but just how money scales once basic needs are taken care of. None of this is an obligation unless you both agree though, in my opinion. In this case, the 22.5k place is split 5.6k/16.9k. Lower earner saves almost 2k (almost 10% of their income) and higher still saves 5.6k (7.5% as opposed to 10%). Everyone wins, but I can see that not everyone would see it that way.\n\nObviously a brain splurge there, but it's been on my mind. I feel vindicated in splitting it this way, I am glad you do too OP.\n\nEdit: more splurge, done now",
            "Absolutely love that you have monthly check ins, clearly does great things for your relationship. So glad you sorted out this issue!",

            "Read your original post and have a couple things imo...so 50-50 is the fairest way to do things all around. However the missing information I found is what was your lifestyle before him compared to now? How much more lavish are you living now if you can't afford half? How were you able to support yourself alone? I don't mean for it to sound harsh but it seems like you're sort of blaming your inability to support yourself on him making more money.\n\nAll that being said, at 50-50 split, if he loves you and is in it for the long haul then it doesn't matter if you run short because he will be there to help and support you in any time of need. If he's upset that you can't go for a date night because you're running tight, then why wouldn't he want to pay for you both to go out and enjoy yourselves.",
            "Just saw the original post. I think it's reasonable he takes on more of the expenses. At $25K you did one hell of a job going 50/50 and I hope he appreciates that. You m'am are a dime a dozen these days. Congrats on the negotiations and good luck on the job prospects. Glad you both came to a reasonable solution.",
            "Frankly \"proportionately split\" is kinda bs if you seriously think about it. You're two adults. You both require the same things equally, like heat, water, food, housing, etc. There might be minor variance in some of these things (liking it colder, or shorter showers, fewer calories, etc). But you're both needing the same things equally. Just because partner 1 makes 25% less than partner 2 doesn't mean partner 2 should pay more for partner 1's living expenses to make the difference between income.",

So there's never any fighting about her spending \"our money\" on skincare, or me spending \"our money\" on horror movies. \n\nIt honestly works out perfectly.",

Dividing expenses by income will give you a percentage. Set up a joint bank account where you both transfer that percent of your income each paycheck and use that account to pay for all shared expenses.\n\nThis ensures you're both spending the same percentage of your income on shared expenses, which I've always thought was the fairest way to do it, and you an just adjust the percentage as your individual incomes change, plus leaves you both with personal accounts where you can spend that money however you'd like without guilt",

Am I a horrible person? What do I do? \n\nI'm sorry for leaving you guys hanging yesterday. I was trying to be vague in the last post because I know my boyfriend had mentioned in passing that he kept an eye on this sub in case I ever posted, but I didn't realize he meant that he checked at every single break. He was able to find it anyway so now it doesn't matter. \n\n**I'm okay, just to get that out of the way! First of all, wow.... you guys, thank you so much. I haven't read all the comments yet because I had no idea this would get so big, but thank you.. you are all such wonderful people. To everyone who offered me a place to stay or a ride, I can't thank you enough... Just knowing that there are people out there who would help a complete stranger is very touching and I wish  I could tell you how much I appreciate every single one of you... thank you.**\n\nTo those of you saying I'm abusive for posting this, hell, I didn't mean it that way, but maybe? I didn't plan for or want him to see it but I can see what you mean.  \n\nAnyway, last night was probably the biggest night of my life so bear with me if it starts getting too long.\n\nI've been in therapy for the last three years and one of the things my therapist had me do was get a backpack ready with everything I might need in an emergency. Within two minutes of receiving his text yesterday and posting the edit I grabbed that backpack and was planning on just walking so at least I wasn't home(I don't have a car) I was thinking about just going through my contacts and talking to who ever I could but that didn't work out.\n\nJosh was outside parked down the street!! He was trying to catch me leaving! So when he sent the text that said \u201csaw your post I'm coming home\u201d he was **ALREADY** home. He was fucking waiting.\n\nI just stood there cause I didn't know what to do, I thought he was going to be furious but he ran up to me with a completely different react than I expected... he was crying, like balling his eyes out. I still felt like I was waiting for him to get mad or scream at me or something but he just hugged me really tight and said he's so sorry. He said he had no idea I felt that way and that he knows he has jealousy issues and a temper and asked if we could talk about it inside. He begged me to come in and said he couldn't lose me and he loves me.\n\nI didn't know what to do, I just followed him in. He took my backpack from me and when he looked at it he just broke down. He asked if I was really leaving him, why I didn't tell him things were this bad, why I never talk to him....\n\nI told him I can't talk to him. Every time I have ever decided to trust him and open up about even the tiniest thing that's bothered me (like him asking for other girls' numbers in front of me or him hanging up on me constantly) he always loses his shit and starts screaming at the top of his lungs while I just sit there as quiet as possible and apologize. And then this is where he changed, at this point he was no longer acting like he was sorry, he'd switched to \u201cyou're full of shit, I treat you like a goddamn angel and get walked all over in return.\u201d He said he should never have to apologize to me.\n\nI was very upset so I played one of the fights I recorded and I'm so glad I kept those after he told me to delete them... Even in the first three minutes of it you can tell I was being calm, the first thing I say is \u201cbaby, I didn't mean to say anything was wrong with us, I just wanted to know why you don't want me to apply at [place I could use my degree]. I just want to help make money.\u201d He immediately starts yelling \u201cyou'll cheat on me and find someone better! Fuck off, go find some guy to fuck at [place]. I don't give a fuck you'll come crawling back to me, no one else would put up with you! FUCK YOU!\u201d This fight was pretty recent but he only listened to a few seconds of it. \n\n(I know some people who commented on the last post suggested that maybe I really am screaming back at him \u2013 someone said something about slapping him too, neither of us have ever slapped the other though \u2013 and I understand that may be something to consider. But I know that I don't yell. I have a hard time standing up for myself and I hate confrontation, especially with him. I always just want to make the fights better. I know I need to work on that, and I've brought it up in therapy before, but I just felt like adding that)\n\n\nHe got up and said \u201cfuck off with that shit.\u201d \nHe was definitely not apologetic and sweet anymore so I was just quiet. He said he's done with this shit and I have no right to record him and then he ripped the phone out of my hand. He said more stuff but I can't remember everything. I asked what he was doing, but he just glared at me and then he stomped outside with it and then threw it as hard as he could. I don't know why but that just broke my heart so much, he's broken things of mine before but I had been planning on calling a friend or my brother and I didn't know any of their numbers. I asked him what he did with it but he wouldn't answer.\n\nHe slammed the door so hard when he came in that I flinched, then he bumped into me really roughly and went straight to his computer where he put his headphones on and turned up his music really loud. (He always put his headphones on in a certain way when he's mad, cause then he can't hear me) He started playing a game and he was literally fuming. I stood in the door and he looked up at me and the way he looked at me was awful. I could feel that he absolutely hated me, and what's sad is that wasn't even the first time he's looked at me that way. I think I was kind of in shock, I always feel that way when he's mad. He kept playing games so I went out to look for my phone, which I found parts of shattered on the street but I never found the battery and I don't think it was usable. When I went back in I was shaking :[\n\nWe talked it out later I think everything is going to be okay.\n\n\n*Just kidding.*\n\nI don't know why but I just felt so done, I grabbed his phone off the counter and ran outside. I knew he used to text my brother and he had the number of the friend I watched a movie with a while back (to make sure I was where I said I was) so I used his to call them.\nMy brother answered on the second ring and I didn't know what to say so I just started pouring my heart out, I told him I'm sorry we haven't talked in so long, but that I'm really scared and have no where to go.\n\nGuys, this hurt more than anything my boyfriend has ever said or done and I'm still so surprised that he would have this reaction after so long...  I can't remember the beginning but the last thing he said was \u201cyou deserve everything that's happening to you\u201d and hung up. \n\nHe hates me. He really thinks I deserve to stay with Josh because I'm attracted to girls. \n\nAt the time I just thought fuck him and I called my friend (who I'll call A). Well she didn't answer at first, but then she called right back! Thank you all so much for suggesting that I call her because she was so happy to hear from me and I told her everything that happened, she said she was 30 minutes away and she would come with her husband (I didn't even know she had gotten married! :[ ) so I went back in and oh my god that was a horrible 30 minutes. I didn't what to do I was so fucking worried he'd come out because I didn't want to see him (I'm a bad liar and he'd know something was up) . I didn't want him to notice my stuff all packed up so I just put all my cords/controllers/clothes and small things I couldn't live without in a box but left the big stuff. A got there really fast and her husband (who is such a nice guy) helped me load my desk/chair and computer in their truck.\n\nThis is the part I'm not feeling so great about right now.\n\nI left without saying a word to Josh. \n\nI could still hear him playing games in the other room and the only thing I wanted in the entire world was for him to hug me and tell me it was okay and \u2026wow my heart really hurts today, I can't even see through the tears to type this out.. I know how he sounded but I really loved him so much and it feels like I ripped my own limb off... When I think about his face and smile and everything that was good I feel like there's a huge hole in my chest. \n\nBut when I play these fights I recorded, and think about my future and this amazing friend who came and saved me and everything I can do with my life... I feel so happy. I thought I needed Josh, but man.. it's so amazing feeling like I don't. I have to get a new phone, though :[\n\nThank you all so much, you are all amazing people. I received so many thoughtful messages and I can't tell you how thankful I am that I ended up posting here.\n\nI'm with A now, and she lives in a house I've never been to so I'm pretty sure Josh won't find it. And she invited another girl I haven't seen in years to go to a concert on friday night and I am so excited! We had strawberry daiquiris and watched stupid horror movies all night and her husband is making waffles right now!\n\n\n\n\n\nGuys... I'm free. I'm so fucking happy. I'M FUCKING FREE!!\n\n\n\nFuck you, Josh. Eat a dick.\n\n**TL;DR;** Left a very unhealthy relationship and I'm on a roller coaster of emotions. Thank you, Reddit. \nWhat do I do now?\n\nP.S. Sorry for the length - ^said^no^guy^ever \n\n**Edit:** Something I forgot to add is that A's husband (who is a software developer) noticed something on my computer when I turned it back on at their house to show them the post. It's called SniperSpy and that is how Josh knew about my post. I thought he'd just been super-stalking r/relationships, but nope. He installed a spy app on my pc. I know it shouldn't take a software developer to notice an icon on my desktop, but I never saw it before so I think it must've popped back up when I restarted my computer. Just a warning to those out there who value their privacy, I didn't realize it was possible to spy on someone like that.",

For years, he's been the only one who could tear you down and also the one who could pick you back up again. It changes the reward center in the brain. It's like an addiction and you will go through withdrawals. It's going to hurt for a while. But he did not deserve a good bye. He has been so, so, so horrible to you. You did the right thing. I'm just sooooo happy for you right now! \n\nEdit: Please have A block his number though. It would be for the best. When you get your new phone, it'll probably be best to get a new number as well.

            "I dated someone a lot like Josh. A lot of his behavior comes from intense insecurity and a desire to have control over you. Make sure that you stay away from any kind of contact.\n\n When we broke up, I tried to be \"friends.\"  I felt so free and happy out of the insular world of getting screamed at for tiny transgressions like boiling pasta incorrectly or going to the wrong grocery store. I also felt like the good times in our relationship made it so it was worth trying to have some kind of friendship. He responded to my friendship by constantly trying to manipulate us back together. He told me over Facebook that he was going to kill himself and then didn't pick up the phone. His goal was to make me panic and think, just for a little while, that breaking up would make me complicit in his death. Those moments of terror actually had the effect, when I finally got a hold of him, of killing my lingering love. \n\nWe went to the same small college so I lived off campus to avoid him, but that didn't stop him from stalking me at my classes. It finally culminated with him faking a heart attack outside of my class to get my attention. That wasn't just burning a bridge, it was dropping a nuke on it. We have not spoken since.\n\nThe good thing about the whole mess, in my opinion, is that I am now immune to manipulative bullshit. And I'm in a happy healthy relationship with someone who loves me and treats me with respect. This is the hardest thing you will ever do, but you're so strong and kind. You are tougher than you think. And think about how easy it will be live your life free of this toxic garbage man.",

You will realize how good healthy relationships feel and no longer miss the singular unhealthy relationship you've been in for so long. I know it is difficult to imagine, but you will get there. It will get easier every day. \n\nI just want to say that I am really happy for you and your new life. Josh will try and contact you again, without a doubt. If you do need to see him, for whatever reason, please have a police escort. He should not be trusted with your well-being. ",

Look up \"trauma bonding.\" You are going to rebound and go through \"withdrawals\" from this. If you start to notice yourself feeling more impulsive/promiscuous/depressed/suicidal try not to get mad at yourself or blame yourself but be aware of what you were thinking right before it happened.

Things will get better in time. **DO NOT- I REPEAT- DO NOT GO BACK TO HIM UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE OR PROMISE**  He is not going to change. Unfortunately, he is one of the few humans who truly does not deserve to live. I'd fuck this guy up myself, if I could. I hope he gets sent to a prison where Big Bubba ass-rapes him daily and makes him his bitch. I hope they beat him down and go fucking Jeffrey Danhmer on him.

Change your phone number, email, block him on social media, or start new SM accounts so he can't try to track you through ghost profiles. \n\n3) the friend and hubby that picked you up care more about you than you realize. Focus on your relationship with them and the people that treat you similarly. These are the people you NEED in your life. \n\n4) seek therapy. it may hurt, but losing someone down the road that's worthwhile will hurt more, and you need to regain YOU again. \n\n5) not all men are scumbags. This is something to recall down the road. \n\n6) your brother not accepting who you are is inexcusable. Don't beat yourself up because his hate can't accept your reality.",

She is a true friend to step up in a moment's notice like that, especially since you were so estranged that you didn't know she was married (not your fault). She must've always had you in the back of your mind that you'll come around one day. She is a really good friend. Keep her close.\n\nYes it hurts now like having a limb cut off, as you said.

I'm going to guess that the posts of support for him are either his own throwaway accounts or some idiots that he talked into supporting him (somehow). So not only was he likely trying to gaslight you, his lack of hesitation to destroy your phone and riddle your PC with spyware to monitor all your communications is beyond the pale. \n\nThe long and short of it, Josh likely never trusted you or even really loved you.

            "Hey, the behaviour you describe from your boyfriend in undoubtedly abusive. It sounds to me a *lot* like Borderline Personality Disorder, which in men leans towards violent outlets (either externally or internally focused). There are a number of BPD support/help forums on reddit including /r/bpd /r/bpdlovedones and /r/bpdsoffa . Having a read through some of the stuff on those might help to make sense of what has happened to you over the last 8 years and hopefully to help towards healing. You have every chance of yourself suffering from C-PTSD or similar after such a long time exposed to the behaviour that you describe. Please be strong and find a good therapist to help you work through what has happened to you.\n\nEDIT: Just saw the bit about what your brother said. That sucks really hard, I'm sorry he wasn't there for you when you needed him.\n\nEDIT2: Plenty of people hopping on the downvote train that apparently have not familiarised themselves with the literature on the subject. To be clear, I'm not attempting to provide a diagnosis, but merely to make the observation that the behaviour of the boyfriend as described by OP in her two posts clearly line up with the diagnostic checklists for someone with BPD, and that in terms of spousal/partner abuse, BPD & ASPD are significantly over-represented amongst the perpetrators, to the point where some believe that Personality Disorders are not simply correlated with violence by men but are in fact *the* underlying reason for some men's perpetration of violence (Ehrensaft *et al.* 2006). Anyway, OP has done the right thing by exiting herself from the situation, and I sincerely hope that she gets the help she needs over the next few years to fully recover from what must have been a truly harrowing period in her life.",
