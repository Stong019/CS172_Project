First of all, I want to say I was absolutely blown away by the outpouring of love and support I received on my first post. I never could have imagined it would blow up like that and I received so many thoughtful and kind comments and messages from strangers. \n\nThat being said, when I wrote that, I was in a weird place. Physically I had mostly healed but I was determined to shove down any emotional trauma because I was so exhausted from the previous months of work trying to heal my body. I wanted to be alright, and I wanted my marriage to be the same as it was before the accident. \n\nMy husband and I just attended our third marriage counseling appointment and I\u2019m very happy to report the exercises and worksheets we\u2019ve been given are helping rebuild the husband/wife relationship instead of the caregiver/patient relationship which has been present for the last 5 months. My husband just had his first individual therapy appointment a few days ago and I have mine next week. In short, we\u2019re putting in the work. \n\nWe\u2019re also having sex again! Like, *a lot* of sex! I feel silly bragging about that to the internet at large, but it makes me so happy that we\u2019ve figured out that part of all this. Prior to the accident and really throughout our whole relationship we\u2019ve been so ridiculously into each other, it was rare we even skipped a day. I missed having that connection to him and he was clearly hurting too. \n\nAnyway. I just thought everyone deserved an update \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\n\n\nTL:Dr- we\u2019re getting better!",

It varies for everyone but I understand intimacy being a huge part of your emotional needs in your relationship.\n\nI'm curious what you'd care to share about your husband's perspective/breakthrough/etc on this?  I think it'd be helpful for some to hear whatever you care to share and if not or too private tooootally understand.",

It is amazing how you are healing physically, and how you both are healing mentally, and especially how you have been able to do it **together**. Sudden changes in life can be terrifying to the point where we subconsciously hide our trauma to the point where even we ourselves don't realize it. \n\nI am so happy that you have each other, and am sending you all the good vibes, albeit as a random internet stranger, to you both. Much love, random stranger! Keep healing! \n\nEdit: fixed typos, \"thw\" to \"the\" and \"qhere\" to \"where\"",

Caregiving is hard and I\u2019m still working through the trauma of watching him bleed out in front of me, but I still feel guilty that I can\u2019t give him what he wants. He\u2019s so patient and understanding, but I haven\u2019t been able to explain why. I think I\u2019m just not mentally safe yet. Your post has given me the worlds to explain why to him. Thank you.",
            "You treat each other like partners, taking care of that partnership, giving each of you the space to grow there. You're both brave enough to reach out not only to each other, but third party help (pro counseling) to help things along with supplemental nurture if needed. Cherish your time together. I've lost two loves (meningitis and cancer), great partners, and the best part of the time with them is not taking them for granted while I had them, we took good care of what we had while we had it. That always seems to be the hallmark of the great loves, you appreciate what you have so much while you have it.",
            "I am so happy for you! To a lesser extent my fianc\u00e9 saw me faint and pass out and hit my head a week or so ago in the shower. When I came to he was literally shaking and would not let me go. He kept apologising that he couldn\u2019t catch me right so I still hit my head. I kept telling him I was fine but he was so shaken he took me straight to the ER. I genuinely believe that for me it was fine a \u201cshit happens\u201d moment but for him truly traumatising. From what he said he thought I had an aneurism because I was out for a solid minute. He is still treating me like I could break at any moment. Annoying but I totally understand it. It\u2019s super scary to see someone you love, who you believe will be with you for the rest of your life have a human moment which proves the fragility of life.",

        "selftext": "Hello, everyone.\n\n[I wrote here two months ago about my relationship with my wife.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c3ms1o/i_24f_am_at_the_end_of_my_rope_with_my_wife_27f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) She was a hoarder and had a litany of other issues that were above my pay grade. I asked Reddit if I should leave by July 1, and it was unanimous that I absolutely should.\n\nI didn\u2019t leave July 1.\n\nI left the night of June 30.\n\nThe cleaning didn\u2019t get done, surprising literally no one. We were driving to our apartment and I told her that I was really crestfallen about July 1.\n\n\u201cWhy? Is that a bad date for you or something?\u201d\n\nI was furious, but kept it to myself. I told her how I felt, and I reminded her of my deadline. I told her that I was moving out and that I was done.\n\nShe cried and cried and cried, and begged for a week to clean the apartment to \u201cshow that she was committed to this marriage\u201d. I said that she was free to do it, but I wasn\u2019t going to sleep there during that, and I moved in with my friend. We agreed to reassess the condition of the apartment Sunday morning. \n\nShe told me how spiritually edifying it was to clean. I was really optimistic for a bit. \n\nWednesday comes and my FIL calls me, frantic. He\u2019s like a dad to me. He tells me that my wife emailed him (which she never talks to him unless she has to), and I asked why. He told me that she begged him to tell me to \u2018come back home\u2019. He remarked that it was bizarre, but I was incensed. \u201cNo, FIL, it\u2019s not bizarre, it\u2019s shitty. She\u2019s trying to leverage you though our relationship to get me back.\u201d\n\nSaturday comes and she sends me a message on Facebook saying \u201cyou know, it doesn\u2019t look as good as I wanted it to physically, but I feel like I\u2019ve made a lot of progress emotionally and *isn\u2019t that what matters?*\u201d\n\nI told her that such progress would have been appreciated two years ago, but I had to walk- I couldn\u2019t do it any more.\n\nShe spent money online with our card without informing me on yarn and we had a disagreement about it. I told her that I wanted the bank account closed, but she \u201ccouldn\u2019t bear to see me in person\u201d. I redirected my checks to a new account instead.\n\nIt had been weeks and I finally went back to get my things and it got a lot worse. There was a water leak in the carpet, the litter boxes weren\u2019t taken care of since I took care of them the day I left, and she managed to move the microwave into her bedroom. The latter was particularly surprising because she refused to move anything heavier than 10 lbs because of a cited rotator cuff injury for years and yet got a 40 lbs microwave into her room.\n\nI reported the conditions to my MIL, who co-signed the lease with us. She called me back to bemoan \u201cwhat am I going to do about my daughter? You don\u2019t understand how hard it is to have to think about how to take care of her!\u201d\n\nI snapped at MIL about her nonsense. She asked me what she should do about my ex-wife, feeding her histrionic personality. I told her that I had no idea, but she signed papers 27 years ago that made it her responsibility and not mine.\n\nI\u2019m happily living with my friend. Her and I are currently figuring out what we are, but we\u2019re being supportive of each other and making each other lives easier. We both just celebrated birthdays (happy quarter-century!) and that was perfect. \n\nI\u2019ve been told that my ex-wife has had a much more rigid and stoic affect since I left. MIL told me that she didn\u2019t even say she missed me. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice if she came back.\u201d\n\nI heard from FIL that they\u2019re mad that the car I have is in my name; it was given to me as a graduation present, and was an old family car.\n\nI start my new job tomorrow. I\u2019ve been getting ready all last week and I am so nervous but so excited.\n\nI\u2019m really glad I left.\n\nTL;DR: My wife begged me for her last second chance, still didn\u2019t do anything. Tried to get her dad to bend my arm to come back. She wrecked the apartment even more since I left, so I notified MIL. MIL is more concerned about herself than her daughter. I\u2019m happy with my friend and I start my big girl job tomorrow, and thank God.\n\nEDIT: I made this clarification in the comments, but it needs to be said- I was estranged from my friend when I got with my wife. I was disowned for being gay by my family and had to immediately leave college and sought refuge with my ex-wife, and my friend and I fell out of contact. We got into contact again this year when I was interviewing for jobs in the area where she lived, not knowing that she was there. I\u2019m trying to figure out how we\u2019re going to be roommates in the long-term, and for how long, etc. Logistics.",

He cried and talked about his issues, we broke up. I'm much better for it.\u00a0\n\nFirstly, thank you to everyone who commented on my original post. I got so much from it, and seeing so many supportive comments really helped me. I learned a lot, so thank you all so much. I realised through reading your comments that I was in an emotionally abusive relationship. It wasn't communication tips I needed, I needed to get out.\u00a0\n\nThe past month has been so up and down but I wanted to share an update. After a pretty weird \u201cstepping on eggshells\u201d kind of morning, I confronted him about his behaviour and mood swings. I prepped myself for a huge argument and honestly it didn\u2019t go exactly as I expected. First of all he started to deny he was doing anything wrong, but for once I stood my ground. I don\u2019t think he was expecting that. I had lots to say (many of your comments came in useful there), and I tried so hard not to back down.\u00a0\n\nAfter a while he kind of\u2026 changed. He got upset. He then started saying all sorts of things, that he was sorry but he didn\u2019t realise how his behaviour affected me (though I\u2019d brought it up many times). A little later on he said that he had been thinking for a few months that it was his fault my doctor said I had depression. So that\u2019s a huge contradiction?? He said that for a few weeks he had been thinking about breaking up with me \u201cbecause it\u2019s my fault that you are this way and breaking up sooner would have been the noble thing to do\u201d, but that he was so torn for ages. He said that\u2019s why he had been even more awful to me lately, that his frustrations were just coming out. Again, contradicting what\u2019s he said about not realising how his behaviour affected me. He said he has never cheated but I\u2019m really not sure if I believe that. Maybe it\u2019s best if I don\u2019t know.\n\nThen something really unexpected happened, he started to cry, the first time I have ever seen him cry. He told me that he had been texting a work friend over the past few days about our relationship. He even showed me a message she sent to him which went something like this: \u201cyou have a wonderful, textbook girlfriend and you are fucking it up because you are being an ass. This is why everyone at work thinks you\u2019re a psychopath. You are so cold and bad when it comes to feelings\u201d. So I guess it wasn\u2019t just me who found his behaviour not normal??\n\nHe cried even more and said that he doesn\u2019t feel close to people, that there\u2019s only a handful of people he lets in and he doesn\u2019t know why he does that. He said that even being around his immediate family was cold and formal and he doesn\u2019t know why he is like that and can\u2019t connect with people, and that\u2019s also why he throws himself into work so much. I told him that if he didn\u2019t get help, he would end up a very lonely old man. In that moment I felt pretty strong and proud of myself.\n\nSo as you may have guessed, we broke up. Part of me for a while even thought about trying to save it and work at it, and now that I look back I can\u2019t believe I was ever even thinking that. He kept saying \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do for the best, should we break up or not?\u201d But doing so was absolutely the right thing. I\u2019ve since had many friends coming forward saying they didn\u2019t trust him, something was off etc.\n\nRegarding the girl I talked about, his ex who he cheated on his other ex with- I could see on her brothers Instagram a video of my ex smirking at his phone and the caption was \u201che\u2019s thinking about my sister ;)\u201d to which he replied with another winky face so\u2026 what does that say. But I\u2019m not looking Instagram at this stuff anymore. On the day we broke up he packed some bags and left, he told me to stay with a friend. It turns out that that friend was his exes brother, and he\u2019s been living there for a month. I will be moving into a new place in 2 weeks and even though he has gone to stay with his friend he is still paying his share of the rent, he just swings by to pick up some stuff every now and then when I\u2019m at work, I haven't actually seen him.\n\nFor the past few months I\u2019ve been feeling really low, with barely any energy. I\u2019m picking myself back up again and though it\u2019s a slow process, I\u2019m coming back into myself. I\u2019m determined that I\u2019m not going to let anyone make me feel like that again.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I needed to write all of that and if you guys needed all of those details, but writing this was quite cathartic. I guess I would just say, to anyone who is reading this and my original post, who is in a relationship that they feel horrible in, just leave. It\u2019s hard, but please leave. You will feel SO much better.\n\nThanks again, Reddit.",

            "Omg I had to scroll up and see when this was posted to make sure I hadn\u2019t posted it myself and forgot about it :O\nI\u2019m so sorry you went through this but if it\u2019s any consolation- you are not alone! Every single thing your boyfriend said, the crying about not having connections, the reaching out to an ex girlfriend, the friends and family coming forward and telling you they always thought something was \u201coff\u201d the coworkers making comments - it\u2019s crazy! I honestly feel like we are soul sisters based off this post not gonna lie.\n\nI know it\u2019s so hard. I broke up a little over a month ago and it\u2019s been about 3 weeks since I moved out. It is going to have its ups and downs but you for sure did the right thing!!! I also highly recommend therapy. I just started going and even the first session was tremendously helpful.\n\nStay strong, we (the internet reddit people lol) are all so happy for you and rooting for you! You deserve the best in life- all you have to do now is go out there and get it. <3\n\nEdit: just wanted to add I read your previous post and I\u2019m SO SO GLAD you got out!! I stayed for 3 years and didn\u2019t have the guts to leave until he got physically aggressive not once, but twice in the same week. I\u2019m so glad you left while he still had his aggression aimed at the wardrobe and not you. \n\nI am so so proud of you and you should be so proud of you! I don\u2019t even know what else to add except I\u2019m very relieved to know you\u2019re going to be safe now and, eventually, truly happy again. Please don\u2019t ever go back as he will try to come back into your life and love-bomb or future-fake you. You are so much better off without him!",

Everything! But I always caved when he\u2019d flip out the waterworks card. We even went to couples counseling. I was with him for almost 4 years and WHAT a waste of good years.\n\nReally focus on yourself! I live alone and I\u2019m planning some solo traveling for the first time ever.

I don\u2019t share who I see to anyone else unless I got some showing off or relevant experience to share. Plus the fact that his friend is aware of his previous naughty behavior shows u he had a track record being a cheater/player.\n\n1. He went to have a 3 some with his ex and her gf. No one invites a guy over to spend time with 2 bisexual girls alone. \n\n2. He then proceeded the next day to drive to an ex fling\u2019s place 3 HOURS away. No guy drives that far just to grab coffee and catch up with a female college \u201cfriend\u201d \n\n3. Another incident is when he went to that party that u weren\u2019t invite to and spent the night with his ex. \n\nPlus the telltale sign is your dry sex life. This guy sounds like he has more pent up sexual frustration over the year of on and off sex with u rather than any real emotional vendetta. He took his anger and resentment out on u instead of breaking up. Prob cuz u both relied on each other emotionally at first so u stayed longer than u should have. \n\nA nightmare situation all around.",

Courage is being scared shitless but acting nonetheless. \n\nI understand about tearing up when major feelings are occurring. (Possibly due to my depression and Major Anxiety Disorder (I prefer it to a Serious Anxiety Disorder as I'd prefer to think of myself as MAD than SAD!) But it can also be disarming. Other times, when I'm understandably angry etc a bit of a bugger but I still get my point across. \n\nSo glad you're out. It's classic abuser workings, a flare up, than ever so apologetic and then slowly downhill again. Slow but definite, make no mistake. \n\nTherapy can help, but I think you've found a brilliant measure to deal with things. WRITING THINGS DOWN! It helps to calm you and also, because you have to set things down, you're applying order to chaos. Its an incredible help. You don't have to show anyone this, it's your private thing.\n\nBlessed be,  CFQ",

Sure, he might need help, but you're not obliged to be there along for the journey, to your own detriment. If he wants to get better, he's got to do that alone.",

Men like this control you, convince you that you are worthless, make you feel like you don't deserve to be treated well, and then ruin your life if you let them. That is the main point. Never let anyone treat you like that. Someone who loves you will make you feel like your best self. They will listen to you because they care enough to hear you out, and they will not show a tendency to violence because love is kind. \n\nIn abusive relationships, it always starts out with a charming and charismatic partner that knows exactly what to say to you until they feel that have a clutch on you. I see that in everything you said. \n\nYou are worthy of love. The kind of love you give. You do not deserve that type of abuse.

Take some time from dating, don't rush into the next relationship that comes your way. Focus on yourself right now and building yourself into the person you want to be.

I explained how it makes me anxious to come back home to a messy place and would rather keep it tidy as I go, specially if It\u2019s when leaving the house and I\u2019m not late for any commitments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also brought up that I thought it would be good for him to live by himself before we could consider living together. I explained that I used to be very messy when I first moved out of my parents house but with time learned the value of a tidy and clean space in which to feel relaxed. He thought about it and a while after said he thought I was right and he would like to have a go at living by himself, saying he was very excited even thinking about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the days after the talk his attitude changed completely too. At times I would leave for work and he would stay at my house to do some other chores or come and pick me up earlier and take the bins out. He started spending more time at my house after this and we became much closer in the following months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn September R started a new job and for logistical reasons we could not spend the night together unless we were both on a day off the following day (he works Monday-Friday and I work 4 shifts on 4 off). We would go a whole week without seeing each other for more than an hour or two, which was really abnormal for us. We started to make a big effort to meet up at any spare 15 minutes between our jobs and other commitments. Sometimes one of us would drive to the other one after work just to say hi for 10 minutes and then leave. It really showed how much we cared about the relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAround this time I was looking for a new house as i had a raise at my job and could afford to live somewhere on my own as opposed to a shared house. I went to see a flat that was perfect for me. Ticked all the boxes, including budget. The only thing was that as soon as I saw it all I could think of was how it wasn\u2019t to be just mine but mine and R\u2019s.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat evening we sat down and I told him about the flat and what I thought as soon as I saw it. I explained how the efforts we had both put in the relationship over the last few months proved to me that we had a relationship worth cherishing. He asked me for some time to think about it and eventually said he too thought we should move in together. R said he didn\u2019t feel like he needed to live alone to \u201cdiscover himself\u201d. We then sat down and wrote a list of things we would look for in a place, including a budget and how much we would need to spend on furniture, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**( edit:** this note now hangs in our bedroom wall as a sign of how we dreamed this house, planned it and accomplished it together. )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy this time I had decided to forget about the perfect flat I saw and we decided to look for another place together. A few weeks go by and the agency calls me to say the flat I had seen a month before was still available and the landlord had lowered the rent. We went to see it and R loved it as much as me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver the last 5 months he has surprised me everyday. He has taken this flat and looked after it in a responsible adult way. R has been busy fixing everything that needed TLC in the house, spent time decorating the bedroom, he even started to cook and now makes delicious meals. His parents visit often and are super proud of him too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**We are two happy peas in a happy little flat.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for your advice.\n\nSpecial shoutout to /u/baffled_soap for [this comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8lvvkg/how_do_i_26f_talk_to_my_so21m_about_needing_him/dzk3jod?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) It made me realise that maintaining a living space is a life skill anyone can learn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**edit 2:** thank you everyone for all your kind words. I plan to show this post to R when he gets home from work. I should probably add that when friends ask us how living together it's going he says he's the clean one. Cheeky.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: we talked, R respected my space, 5 months after the post we moved in, having the best time in our little beautiful flat.",

He's also had some growing up to do and I've had to express how important a clean house is as well. He's done well to learn as we go. Myself as well. I've never been a good house keeper, but I'm getting more organized as I go. I'm also working much longer hours now, so we both realize that keeping the house clean is much easier and a lot more fun than spending our one day off together... Cleaning. I wish you two much happiness! Enjoy that new space together! ",

Eventually it gets overwhelming and I can't do it.\n\n\nIt was a concern of my ex when she would come over also. She either got anxiety when there from the mess or spent most of her time cleaning it. It wasn't why be broke up but it was an area of strain on our relationship.\n\n\nI went from living in a large house to a small room in a shared living situation. I keep the common area clean but the tiny room gets cluttered quick. This has lead to me picking up more frequently and seems to help me develop a better understanding of how important it is.\n\n\n",

Great communication skills! ",

Even after we got together she didn't understand why it was important to keep our home tidy when hired help was a snap of the fingers away.  \n\nCommunication is key, it's great you knew what you wanted from him and how to communicate it.  Even better was that he could see your point and was happy to accomodate.\n\nWhen we separated she went back to living with her parents (again with hired help).\n\nI'm glad your story ended up with a happier ending than mine!\n\nThanks for sharing!

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, so a few days ago I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9xoy6k/this_girl_early_20sf_in_is_tearing_our_dnd_group/?sort=confidence) about this girl (Sam) in my DND group who everyone has a crush on, and how it's causing a lot of my friends to turn on me cuz they think she has a crush on me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR at the bottom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I wanted to thank everyone for all the great advice I got, and it led me to take some action over the weekend. So on Sunday (yesterday), I was txting with Sam and I decided to bring up and ask her how she was feeling about our gaming group. She confessed to me that she's been feeling really stressed out lately because she feels that Jake and Dave (our DM) have really been ostracizing her, because she's been getting closer to me. She told me that Dave would send her private angry or rude messages, saying mean things about me to her behind my back. I was shocked and honestly kind of defeated to hear how these guys who I thought were my friends treated me behind my back. She said she was so cut up about this and that she didn't want to come to DND anymore because she didn't feel like it's any fun anymore, and that hurt me the most, having her lose something she loves because of some dumb guys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, based on the advice I got here on my last post, I did two things after getting this knowledge. I called up Dave, and told him that he either needs to grow up, and treat her with the respect she deserves, or she will leave the group. He was backpedaling, but eventually came clean that he has a thing for her as well and was just jealous of the attention I was receiving from her. He said that it's not her fault and it's not my fault and it's just something he needs to work through on his own, so at least he was able to be cognizant of that. The second thing I did was talk to Sam frankly about us and our relationship. I told her that I really liked her, and asked her if she liked me as well, which she said she really did, and had for a while now (which made my heart want to explode out of my chest). I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend, even with all this drama going on, and I told her that I was on her side and would support her whatever she wanted to do with our gaming group. In the end, we've decided that we are dating now and we'll both be taking a break from DND for a few sessions before we go back and tell everyone. I am just so happy to have her in my life, and if my friends can't get over the fact that we're dating, she and I will start a new DND group with people who can be adults about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, thank you all for your help, and I'm glad I bit the bullet, I couldn't be happier right now!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: I asked the girl out, she said yes we're dating now :) I called out our DM on his BS and he apologized and said he would cut it out. Looking forward to brighter DND days with my girlfriend!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT: 1.2K?? I never expected this to blow up so much! Thank you again, everyone, for your kind words, thoughts, anecdotes, and advice. I've talked to Dave again today actually and told him that Sam and I were officially together and we want to be able to come back and play all together again, but my respect for Sam's feelings overcomes my want to continue playing with them. Dave told me that he was really sorry for being such an ass before and that he is happy for Sam and I and doesn't want this to come between our friendship. I am hopeful that we can move past this! Also -- to those who suggested Sam invite a female friend to our group, she reached out to one of her best friends from high school who still lives in the area, and she is interested in joining! I think Sam will feel more comfortable, and it'll take some of the spotlight off our new relationship if we invite a new player into our group. Anyway, wanted to update and thank everyone again for all your kind comments.** ",

My husband and I just  started playing D&D together a few months ago and love it! \nSorry your group got stupid, but hopefully now that you are a couple, they\u2019ll get over themselves. \nMaybe not playing characters that are a \u201ccouple\u201d also will help keep them more friendly. And if not, I hope you guys find another group of good people. Maybe more couples... haha. ",

I'm glad for you that you and your girlfriend are able to come together in the face of what could have been a pretty unfortunate situation. ",
            "Nice job being frank with Dave.  DM's who get that way with players are a worse than players who get that way with other players. They can make very unfair rulings to either try and court favor or as \"revenge\".\n\nIf you start a  new DND group, try and get some other female players. Maybe Sam has a friend or two who'd want to play?  A lot of women never even try DnD because of situations like this. Often stories alone are enough to keep some away.\n\nSource: I DM a game with players only from a particular small fandom, most of whom had never played before because of fear of just this situation, and having a selective pool of potential players made everyone a lot more comfortable.",

I get that you feel things are resolved, but i dont see this kumbaya ending you do. I just see WORSE red flags popping up.\n\nRemember the shock you felt finding out who these guys really are. Let's be honest - you already knew they felt entitled to her, ask yourself why would it shock you that they acted on it by being rude and sending her aggressive messages? **They havent even seemed to have apologised, it looks liek they just justified their behaviour to you in a way that you can get where they're coming from. It totally minimises how fucked up they were behaving. Have they even apologised to Sam, or did they just talk to you?**\n\nDon't forgive any of these men. Why the fuck are they still your friends if they treated your GF liek this? They're just mad they got caught, they still actively chose to behave the way they did and i bet they've done it in the past and i can bet they'll do it in the future.\n\nCall out misogyny and entitlement every time you see it and don't remain friends with people who display this behaviour. Even if they're nice in every other way, if they're weird or \"off\" or downright rude & hateful towards women, they're not nice. You are the company you keep and if you keep these guys in your life, Sam really deserves better. ",

Not sure if playing with your friend who admitted to having a thing for your girlfriend would ever feel completely free of weirdness, at least I know it would bug me. Even if you played with other guys, entering the group as a couple sort of sets ground rules from the start. Wishing you guys a very happy future!",
            "Yikes. \n\nIt's disheartening but not surprising that this is still happening in the nerd world.  I used to deal with it before I stopped larping / playing in games of mostly straight cis men.  This was everything from the creepy \"hey\" every day unanswered for a year to unsolicited details about fetishes to straight up stalking. \n\nIt hurts on so many levels.  Not only do you have to deal with crazy jerks who can't take the no but then the good memories of gaming are tainted.  I would not be surprised if they continue to send her hurtful messages or even escalate. \n\nI'm only in two regular games now,  one on roll20 with good,  old friends,  and one that's all women/nonbinary except for the male DM (and it's hands down the best game I've ever played! We even do themed potluck foods for regions we visit in game) Maybe instead of rejoining the drama game put up a want add for female players sick of getting creeped on. I bet plenty of players would jump at a legitimate safe space. \n\nGood luck to both of you. ",

Of course people can't control who they fall for, or are attracted to, but people can control their behavior, and I think it's important to hold people accountable for that. \n\nGlad things worked out for you guys.

Both times it hurt, but I got over one easily enough because they're both good people. The second went a bit rougher because both parties THAT time kinda used me and abused my emotions (it's a long story, but my crush was using me for emotional support while she started secretly seeing the guy who was my confidant concerning my feelings for her... all while he was seeing someone else... neither gave me a heads up and both asked extreme favors that took a lot out of me before breaking the news). \n\nAnyway, enough of my drama.

Here's a little story for you that you might appreciate:\n\nWhen my husband A and I started dating, another guy named J was already sniffing around. J and I had met for drinks and a hang out here and there but never touched, never held hands, never kissed, etc. and he never even told me he liked me (I could tell but still). J and A worked together. I met A one night while at their place of employment and there were instant sparks. We went out a few times and it was clear we wanted to get together officially, so we talked about how to tell A.\n\nOne night, A and J finish work late, and A gives J a ride home. As he was parked outside J's house, he turned to him and straight up said, \"hey man, I think UliKunkl is pretty cool and I want to start dating her. I hope you're cool with that.\" - J looked sad and stammered that he guessed it was alright... (sadface). They shook on it, he thought all was cool. A told me later what he'd said and J's reaction (A scored major points here, no man had ever done that for me/us before).\n\nA and I get together and all was great but at their work, I was getting angry vibes from their female coworkers. It took some digging but it turned out that J told all those ladies that he and I had been hooking up. Painting me as a hussy and A as the guy who swooped in and \"stole\" me away from J.\n\nYou did the right thing being stand up about it, even if it all ends in a way that's not great.

            "Guys are so stupid sometimes lol. Nothing like watching a group of men turn on each other over a woman who both doesn't want that from them and also didn't ask to be the centre of a huge shitshow. Generally I find women don't appreciate that kind of behavior and I suspect your maturity gave you some points in her book. \n\nIf its any consolation, I've been in your situation before and I find people usually get over it. This kinda thing doesn't usually break up solid friendships, those feelings are generally temporary and hopefully there's a solid bedrock there to fall back on. \n\nAlso, congrats man! Nothing beats that new relationship feeling, so enjoy it and don't let the jealousy of nerds get you down!",

Part 3 is the most important.  Forgiving does not mean forgetting.  Just means you release you own pain in this situation and move on.  It does not mean you put up with more abuse or things stay they way the were.  Forgiveness is for you, not the offenders.\n\nParts of a full apology:\n1. Expression of regret\n2. Explanation of what went wrong\n3. Acknowledgment of responsibility\n4. Declaration of repentance\n5. Offer of repair\n6. Request for forgiveness",

            "I'm so proud of you, man! You did good!!! Congrats to both of you!!!\n\nHehehe, this takes me back. This is actually how I really got to know my now-fiance. He invited me to spend time observing their Star Wars rpg--I'd always wanted to give role-playing games a shot, but never got the opportunity. I could tell how much he really liked me, but I was super uncomfortable because that seriously never happened to me like that, and I was somewhat deluded about who he actually was as a person. So, I shot him down before he could even make a move.\n\n...Yeah. Not terribly proud of that one. I was texting him at the time; apparently his closest buddy at the table that night was worried he was so distressed he'd drive into a tree.\n\nBut, while I don't always reccomend it as a general move, he kept trying. (Rightfully) convinced me I had some very wrong impressions, and I started to see him for the kind of man he really was. I love him to pieces--he's perfect for me in all his geeky ways. We play Pokemon and share all manner of video games, and he's DMing  another session of Stars Without Number tonight for me and some of our friends.\n\nSo, I'd like to propose a d20 toast in the lucky couple's honor. May your rolls always be high, and your enemies' rolls low!",

            "Hate to say it man, sounds like those guys are the typical \"nice guys\" that feel they are entitled to a girl just because she happens to share the same interests as them. I see this kind of crap all the time the cosplay world ( and I have seen girls act this way towards guys too). Sounds like you definitely need to find a new D&D group. When someone acts angry that another person doesn't want them, not sad or disappointed, but angry, that's an indicator of a real problem with seeing other people as having their value as individuals. I recommend trying to find a group that already has a girl in it, because there's a much higher chance of not finding that kind of behavior there. Other than that, congratulations on finding someone new in your life!",
            "Good for you! Love a happy ending, especially one where people admits their fault and move past it together positively! ",
            "You are a very kind and forgiving person. I'm not sure if I would have the heart to forgive a friend for talking bad about me just to go out with someone they haven't known long. I'm proud of you and happy for you both :)",

Communication rocks!  \n\nI was in a similar boat before where all my friends liked the same girl but none of us knew that each of us liked her.\n\nHad a big party, I made out with her, then my friend caught us and kicked me out of the house and he ended up having sex with her.  That was his one and only one night stand he has had in his entire life.\n\nHe called me up crying and apologetic and told everyone that we shouldn\u2019t talk to her anymore because our friendship is more valuable.  \n\nI still talk with him, despite that asshole move. Neither of us talk to the girl anymore though.",
