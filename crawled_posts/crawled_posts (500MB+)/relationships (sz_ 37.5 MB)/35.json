        "selftext": "[original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hoeaet/my_24f_boyfriend_25m_is_being_passive_aggressive/) \n\nSo first off, I appreciate everyone's advice. I broke up with my boyfriend! I just couldn't get past him not taking my injury and pain seriously and basically blaming me for it. It was really hurtful that I was in pain and he didn't seem to care at all. It was a relatively smooth breakup. There was no arguing or anything. I told him how I felt and all he said was \"sorry\" but it wasn't a sincere apology. It was more of a \"sorry you feel that way.\"\n\nSo I'm moving out. I'm in the process of beginning to move all my stuff out which I think is the worst part. It's especially not fun on a broken foot! My aunt and uncle live about 40 minutes away and they are more than happy to let me stay with them while I look for a place. \n\nAgain, I really appreciate everyone's advice. I'm happy with the outcome and think it was for the best. If he couldn't take me seriously now, I don't think i could ever trust him to take me seriously or be supportive in a medical situation again. \n\nTL;DR: Broke up with my boyfriend today after he didn't take my injury seriously. I am moving out and feel good about my decision.",

            "Oh man. I broke my foot last year on 4th of July and that's when I learned my ex didn't care. Kudos to both of us for getting out!! Yay for broken feet? Lol",
            "Yeah, he was treating you like garbage, and deserved to be thrown out as refuse in response. Leaving toxicity is so freeing once you're away. As I said to an earlier poster, when I left that asshole, I was over it. Almost immediately. Just couldn't give any less fucks. Good on you.",
            "This is a moment where you can take a whole new road, or stay on the one you\u2019re on. Because he will be super sorry tomorrow and you\u2019ll realize you can maybe work it out and stay together, or really follow through with it. You\u2019re pissed right now (rightfully). \n\nBut If you\u2019re like me, that anger will wear off and you might start double guessing this break up. Which might be fine. I just keep thinking of a similar relationship I had in my 20\u2019s and there was a long time of being unhappy, getting mad, working it out, being unhappy (I even had a similar injury/guilt trip thing). \n\nThen one time I just stuck to it and moved out. It wasn\u2019t even that huge of a fight that spurred it, just the realization that although my boyfriend wasn\u2019t terrible, he was just kind of a jerk and even though starting with him was easier, it wasn\u2019t really fun. \n\nAnyway, getting out of that cycle was the best thing - I ended up meeting someone way, way more right for me. Good luck to you and I hope your foot heals quickly.",
            "I\u2019m proud of you, what an asshat that guy was.\n\nI fractured my foot *entirely sober* getting out of a bunk bed, had to wear a cast on it for almost a month. That shit is a broken bone, and since your ex couldn\u2019t take that seriously I think he might\u2019ve had a broken brain.\n\nCongrats on your escape from his toxicity, girl. It\u2019s not easy to call a spade a spade sometimes.",
            "Good for you! I fractured my wrist while very drunk, at a punk bar, in a mosh pit (I was 26 too, not even a kid \ud83d\ude02) and my husband laughed at me, but was very supportive otherwise. Shit happens, and being salty about it isn\u2019t cute.",
            "As someone who also broke something on July 4th and whose partner has been the most wonderful angel through it all, well done \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Having fractured my foot before as a kid and requiring a boot, it is very serious and requires the same treatment as a break, the only thing is it didn\u2019t break all the way through. A fracture is still incredibly painful, I doubt this fool even understands what a fracture is. He probably thinks it\u2019s akin to a bruise. My Ex was this way when I had a knife fall into my foot on his birthday, complete accident that happened while unloading a dishwasher, he treated me like it was my fault and I did it on purpose to ruin his birthday and take his attention away. \n\nI\u2019m glad you broke up with this boy, he is completely selfish and you deserve so much better than that. He\u2019s not thinking about anyone but himself and showing you his true colours. You\u2019ll find the right guy some day, who treats you right and looks after you when you\u2019re injured, I found one and he\u2019s so kind and caring almost to the point of it being annoying. \n\nTimes are hard right now, but try to keep your chin up and love and care for yourself, be kind to yourself, at the end of the day you are the most important person to yourself, so don\u2019t worry about the loser who couldn\u2019t appreciate the great person that you are.",
            "Usually I mock /r/relationships for pushing breakups, and honestly I didn't go through the comments to see if it was pushed or not, but regardless, good for you!  Way to have some self esteem, I think you made the right choice!",
            "Real friends/significant others step up when you're ill or injured... he should have taken it seriously. He showed you he didn't care about you. What if you had broken your leg and needed serious assistance... luckily it was a fractured foot and you can hobble around in a boot. It sucks you have to move with a broken foot. Please rest it and ice it. I broke my foot in December. It still bothers me. But my best friend came over 3 times a day for over a week to walk my dogs while I was on crutches. My other friend got me a giftcard for the grocery store because I was out of work. It brings me to tears to think about how kind they were during my time of need... your bf didn't even take your injury seriously. Probably for the best he's gone.",
            "I\u2019m so glad to hear that you\u2019re doing this! Super super proud of you! After your last post, I was worried about you, but you seemed to have a very good head on your shoulders. You\u2019re gonna be just fine! I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through this to get there but one day, you will be in a much better place and you can think of this as a positive experience. Again, super proud of you! Good luck!",
            "Good for you!  That guy is trash.  I literally fall down the stairs every other week, no alcohol needed (I\u2019m just a clumsy ass).  And if anyone made me feel any worse than I ALREADY DO for being clumsy, that would be really difficult for me, and heartbreaking if it\u2019s someone I love!",
            "I can see why he would be a bit down but I wouldnt be upset or mean just a bit disappointed and then move on with life. So him being passive aggressive and being childish kind of showed you who he is at this point in life and you did the right thing by not dealing with that bullshit! He should have used his adult conversation skills, said how he really felt and accepted your apology with no more hostility of any kind from him all while helping his hurt girlfriend feel better in any way during and after.\n\nIm glad you wont have to deal with that behavior and hope your next SO is more understanding and acts more like an adult! Best wishes!",
            "I broke my ankle last November playing rugby. My fianc\u00e9 doted on me and helped me without question. He literally had to help me shower and stayed overnight at the ED when I needed a revision. I\u2019m so glad you figured this out before you had kids or was hella deep in a marriage. Reading your story pissed me off.",
            "I'm so glad you broke up! My ex husband and I had a similar thing early on when we were dating, I brushed it off and guess what...he was ALWAYS like that and worse. My pain meant nothing to him. I was in the hospital for food poisoning and when I got out I asked for some seven up. When I got home he was like no I didn't buy it because soft drinks make you fat. Really. You did the right thing. Dudes like this don't get better they get worse. I'm an Internet stranger but I'm so proud and happy fo you!",
            "I used to date men like that. Then my current boyfriend and I started dating and it's wayyyy different. I'm clumsy and fell down a flight of stairs and badly sprained my ankle at his younger brother's football game like 20 minutes in and even though it was the only one of his games he would be able to make it to that year he took me to the hospital and took care of me. Yes he was frustrated but he was also loving and understanding. I hope you get a relationship like that. A partner that cares for you and raises you up rather than what your ex did. You deserve to be unconditionally loved",
            "How can anyone think a fracture is minor. It is a literal bone break. I'm glad you broke up with him even if it was just for the fact he is not very smart.",
            "Well done! Relationships like this just aren't worth it. If your partner can't support you when you're not well, over themselves... especially for an injury which is temporary and will heal, than they're obviously not going to do better if you end up with something not so temporary.",
            "Well done! You deserve someone who'll treat you like a human being, one who has unintentional accidents and suffers pain like everybody else. That guy was not that guy for you.\n\nMy husband jokingly calls me a wuss because I get sick or hurt easily, but he understands I'm not playing it up and he takes care of me. Likewise, I take care of him. He's my person; I take care of the people I love. I hope you find that person one day, too.",
            "This guy sounds like a Piece of Shit, I also bet he won't bother to help you move out while you struggle with your broken foot since \"it was your decision to break up,\"\n\nFuck that guy.",
            "Good for you. I didn\u2019t leave in similar situation; it took me years to realize how much that damaged our marriage. I\u2019m old now, and have given up.",
            "Yeah you have to get away from people like this. Every time I was suffering, my ex wife used to find a way of it being my fault. I stayed with her too long and it broke me",
            "You did the right thing. How they treat you when you are hurt or ill is a huge deal. You were lucky to find out before you got serious with him.",
            "My gf tore her ACL a year after we got together. 2 years on and she's currently working out with more mobility than ever. She's never been stronger since she got her surgery and started taking care of herself. It was a shock. \n\nShe tells me I'm a big part of being able to bounce back but I know 90% of it has been her and her spirit. You don't need anyone other than yourself. You're the only constant in your life. If he wasn't willing to help you heal and help take care of you then you absolutely do not need that negative energy around you when you need to heal. \n\nI'm just a stranger and I'm fucking proud of you OP. Take life into your own hands and bounce back the best can. You're capable of more than you will ever know. \ud83d\udc9a",
            "> I told him how I felt and all he said was \"sorry\" but it wasn't a sincere apology. It was more of a \"sorry you feel that way.\"  \n\nYeah, that doesn't sound like an empathetic person. Anyone who apologizes like that is out in my book.  \n\nKris Gage has a good blog post on Medium on How To Apologize:  \n\n> If you apologize for their experience, and not what you did to impact it, you didn\u2019t apologize.  \n\n> And if you apologize and then add any kind of disclaimer or explanation \u2014 but, except, however, just, etc. \u2014 then you did not apologize.  \n\n> You just did enough to get their attention, and then you used that podium to explain away your behavior. You didn\u2019t take responsibility. And if you don\u2019t accept responsibility, you aren\u2019t apologizing.",
            "fuckin good riddance. This was a blessing im disguise! Glad you got to see how he handled a tough situation now rather than later! Hope you heal quickly and manage to rest your foot!",
            "Good thing you caught how toxic and unserious he was. He's a narcissist... and never cared fuck all about you.",
            "Good for you!!  \n\nStay strong, and find someone who will support you through the 'serious' medical stuff, AND the 'stupid' medical stuff.",
            "Good for you. It shouldn\u2019t matter how you got injured it hurts. I broke my foot in 2018 two and a half months before my wedding and my husband was nothing but accommodating and sympathetic. I\u2019ll also note that I broke my foot in a stupid way doing something he told me To stop doing because I\u2019d fall and hurt myself so way to know what you deserve.",
            "My first marriage ended 20 years ago, when I look back now I can see how my ex wife used my back injury against me. The injury required a lot of physical therapy, something that was not available at home so during the weekI stayed with a friend 2 hours away. Since the injury was caused by driving  a semi 8 to 10 hours every day, it was very painful to drive home. She used that ad an excuse for her to cheat on me.",
            "Sad. If my wife was injured I would hurt for her and go out of my way to accommodate her. In some ways I would \u201cfeel her pain\u201d because I love her and worry about her when she\u2019s hurting.",
            "I broke my foot almost a year ago and when it first happened, I don't think my boyfriend immediately understood that I really was in a lot of a pain and also that I genuinely couldnt walk. At first, I needed help with everything, even showering and I couldn't drive because I broke my right foot so he had to drive me to all my doctor's appointments. I could walk after 3 months and stopped limping around 5......and now it doesn't hurt me at all anymore. It took him some time to reconcile the idea that life as we knew it was going to be very different for awhile. I'd say be patient with your boyfriend and see if he comes around.",
            "My collar bone was considered fractured but i saw the xray and the bone\u2019s break was several cm apart. Not a small injury. But what a jerk yo",
            "Yay!  So happy for you.  You deserve better.",
            "A good way to think of this is.. if you never got hurt would you stay together? Who knows maybe this was meant to happen so you can see what a jerk he is.\n\n But now you know how he acts and can see how manipulative and passive aggressive he is all while you\u2019re recovering from an injury! \n\nYou deserve someone to wait on you and take care of you when you\u2019re down, because you would also do the same for your partner. Good riddance to garbage partners!",
            "This reminds me of when i twisted my foot while stepping off a curb, which fractured the side of my foot, three days before my friends wedding (of which i was a bridesmaid). She was extremely annoyed, accused me of being drunk and told me that if i cant walk unaided down the aisle that i wasnt allowed in her wedding. Our 15 year friendship became much more distant after that. People who begrudge you over accidental injuries suck.",
            "My ex once told me that he knew my foot wasn't broken because he watched a lot of medical shows. He was pissed that I insisted on going to the doctor, where the xray showed that my foot was indeed broken! Apparently the media is not doing a thorough job educating our couch potato MDs.",
            "I broke 2 bones in my foot just walking my new puppy, basically they started as fatigue breaks that then got worse because I couldnt rest my foot. I couldnt not walk the puppy, since he was training to pee outside, but it took 3 months before my foot was back to normal, because I had to keep walking on it, and the boot wasnt really the main part of the healing process, rest should have been.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, it hurt like a mofo, so 100% fuck your ex. What an ass.",
            "I fell down a few steps, completely sober, and tore a ligament in my ankle in April that still swells at night and is painful 9 weeks later. I can\u2019t imagine the pain if I fractured the bone. Glad you got out smoothly!",
            "First of all, you did well. Second of all, as a girl who also hurt her foot while being drunk, you\u2019re right to take it seriously. It messed me up pretty bad (it was 4 years ago and I\u2019ll have issues for life bc doctors didn\u2019t take me seriously). So, yeah, you and your health come first! Take care",
            "Imagine your bf when someone asks about you. \u201cWe broke up-she broke her foot and well that was the last straw.\u201d What a loser.",
            "Off tangent but my ex would almost always apologise with \"sorry you feel that way\" instead of \"sorry\" and I only just grasped the difference between the two when I read your post. Glad you  put yourself first & focused on your health!",
            "I've fractured my foot before, and it is NOT \"minor.\" I had to take a month off work while it healed and when the boot came off, had to take it very easy as my muscles were weak and not able to hold me up properly. It is very obvious he did not care about your health with this mean injury downplaying comments and behaviour. So glad you are taking care of yourself and leaving this guy. I wish you all the best!",
            "You have been saved from a lifetime of misery. Go celebrate it!",
            "Foot fractures are no joke.  Broke mine a year ago.  Needed 2 operations on it.  It\u2019s never going to be right and was painful as hell.  You are better off without him.",
            "I broke my pinky toe a couple of years ago and even that, just one digit, was almost as excruciating as childbirth. And they couldn\u2019t do anything but tape it up. \n\nHe sounds like a huge ass and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re free of him!",
            "I was a bit hesitant to respond to this but I still believe that different perspectives are always good to grow and understand people.\n\nMy immediate feeling was sympathy for your boyfriend but please hear me out.\n\nI am a child of alcoholics. My father was an alcoholic his whole life - my mother turned slowly into a even more emotionally burdensome person over the course of years.\n\nRecently I had a huge fight with my girlfriend when we were both drunk. When she is drunk I tend to babysit her - she would do whatever pleases her in that moment - steal a bike, go somewhere, keep drinking. She is not a bad person in any way but when she is drunk she is uncontrollable.\n\nI always thought I am kind of okay with that but then I blew up and got very mean to her while she puked her guts out. It turned out I shoved away the trauma with my parents - I had to always function while they behaved like crazy and then the next day they denied any responsibility \"because they were a bit drunk\".\n\nWhen I was reading your post I was reminded of my mother falling and breaking her foot when she was out on a festival. She said she just casually slipped and thats how it happened. The next morning we had to go to the hospital - I was around 13 I would say - and I had to wait for hours while she got scanned and diagnosed with a fracture.\n\nI dont know why I am telling all of this but when you wrote your first post and said \"I dont drink often but I get tipsy quickly\" I was asking myself if you actually are in control of your drinking. Getting in a different state of mind quickly is a big problem when you drink. Falling and breaking your foot while drinking is problematic.\n\nI just wonder if your boyfriend might felt like I do when my girlfriend gets drunk and I have to deal with the results of her evening. \n\nAnyway I hope you are doing better and maybe in your time to heal from this relationship you could soul search a bit and ask yourself if there might be a problem you have that you are minimizing.",

            "Your BF was right that you were being irresponsible. Being drunk is not an excuse for being clumsy.\n\nBut he shouldn't have acted out harshly, and instead taken your fault in stride. After all, relationships are a compromise.\n\nYou were right to break up. Regardless that being drunk was your fault, no one should be in a hostile relationship.\n\nOf course there's always the route of perseverance with patience and communication to see if a conflict is salvageable. But that is a hard goal to set for someone just from a single post.",
            "Good on your ex bf. It sounds like you don't take responsibility for your actions. We don't have much information about your lives, but you moving out means he's paying the rent and is working. This means he was looking forward to that trip and you don't show any empathy for him. If he was taking days of for this and paid upfront then yes, he has all reasons to be pissed off. Your drunken self ruined all of this. Being drunk doesn't mean you're freed of any responsibility.",

            "Honestly, you sound like your throwing yourself a bit of a pity party and seem to be using pretty over dramatic language...regardless, if you decided to move out over this, the relationship probably wouldn\u2019t have worked out in the long run, as that seems to be a fairly minor relationship dispute to move out over.",

        "selftext": "In the original post, [I described](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bmb8j3/im_27f_scared_my_friend_50m_is_becoming_isolated/) the predicament of my dear friend, a >30-year HIV survivor who suffered massive inexplicable treatment failure and was alone all day in the hospital because his husband was at work and he'd kept his condition a secret. I also described my quixotic effort to become his one-woman T cell cheerleading squad.\n\nI'm sorry to report that my friend has died. After all that could be done was done, he went home and passed away surrounded by his loved ones.\n\nHis suffering is over. That's supposed to be the important thing. In the original post, I avoided talking about the suffering. How his intestines had filled with abscesses and bacterial films and Kaposi sarcoma and God knows what else to the point where he vomited fecal matter. How he weighed \\~80 pounds and had a bedsore that showed bone.  How the virus had invaded his brain in a way that might have condemned him to Alzheimer's-like deterioration had he lived, even with the newest and best drugs. He'd stolen three decades from HIV and that bastard was out for revenge. Call me a sweet summer millennial child if you like, but it was the worst thing I've ever seen.\n\nNonetheless, I'd be lying if I said I was taking his death well. I'm writing this  from inside the Pillow Fort of Grief I built in my living room. Redditors have no way of knowing, but he was a wonderful, special person. I opened my heart to him for a reason. The world is a worse place without him.\n\nI'm grateful for the advice of some of those who commented on the original post. I did ease  up on the presents. When I visited the hospital, I focused on just spending time with him. We watched a lot of HGTV, and I would try to  make him laugh by making fun of the questionable taste and skewed priorities of the couples on House Hunters. I held his hand, brushed  his hair, stuff like that. The last time I saw him, I told him I loved him and kissed him on the forehead. He could speak faintly at that  point. He said, \"you're so good to me.\" You probably have no idea what that meant; I've always thought of myself as a robot and a moral failure, and he knew it. He was the gift-giver in the end.\n\nOn social his husband is maintaining that he died of freak complications  from routine surgery. I wish I could tell him he didn't have to do this, but this very week an authority figure in town went viral for a deranged homophobic rant in which he said, among other terrible things, that AIDS was God's punishment. I feel like I'm trapped in an '80s time warp, but minus all the fun parts with the synth music and crazy fashion. \n\nI don't know what happens now. Clinical depression? Volunteer work? Befriending the husband? There's a big old void right in the middle of my life. It's the price you pay for caring, sometimes.\n\nTL;DR rest in peace my beautiful friend\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*\\* Wow, this post exploded. I am overwhelmed by all the condolences and well wishes and unusable throwaway karma coming my way. You're all the kind heart of Reddit. And you like my writing? That's too much. Stop it. \n\nPeople are asking why I think I'm a bad person. The answer is that I was diagnosed (probably correctly) with an autism spectrum disorder in my teens and told that my social deficits were caused by failure to develop the capacity for empathy. There is now tons of pushback on this theory of autism, but it was dominant at the time. I was vulnerable and impressionable and I thought, \"Oh no, I'm a sociopath. I'll have to spend the rest of my life hiding how rotten I am inside.\" I mope about my moral fiber the way other women mope about their weight. I'm doing it right now, fretting over whether this post is narcissistic. \n\nMy friend showed me another side to myself, a bright mirror. He changed my life. Losing him is heartbreaking.",

            "You are a lovely caring person, OP.\n\nI'd say let the husband know you're there for him if he needs/wants, but otherwise focus on yourself now. If you find yourself depressed for longer than two weeks, try to find a counselor or perhaps even a grief support network. The hospital might know some specifically tailored to relatives/friends of people who've recently passed. Sometimes the act of simply talking about your feelings and experiences and/or listening to others is what you need to process them and begin to move on.\n\nVolunteer work also seems like it could potentially help. Be careful of what kind of volunteer work it is though--volunteering at hospitals or with the homeless can invite the same \"price you pay for caring\" feelings re: the situations that various people are suffering through. It's easy to feel frustrated that you can't make more of a difference.\n\nWhatever you decide to do, take care. :)",

He was the gift-giver in the end.\n\nYou have acted the opposite of how you think of yourself here!  \nYou stood by a terminally ill person until the very end for the sole reason of giving him your undivided attention and lovingkindness. To simply make him feel loved and seen, without any personal gain. Being present with someone who is terminally ill is a very hard thing to do. Yet you did it anyway. You gave this man your unjudgemental support when he suffered. The best of gifts and, in my humble opinion, there is not much to top that off when it comes to morality.",

Imagine a whole generation of gay men dying because people weren\u2019t sure what was up at first, and when we did we had people who didn\u2019t care. Politicians doing nothing or calling it God\u2019s wrath. \n\nNow, there are countless people of all sexualities infected. It\u2019s treatable.

Afterwards, my family all decided to tell people she died from pneumonia.  It's 2019, the disease has been around for decades. Did they think it would be more honorable had she passed away from cancer? I don't advocate, and I don't tell people on purpose, but I'll never lie when people ask.

It's horrifying to look back at all the young lives that were lost in the early days of the epidemic. I can't imagine losing all my friends to something so awful on top of the ignorance and homophobia that they had to face. It breaks my heart and fills me with anger. There needs to be more of you out there. I'm sure it meant the world to your friend that you were there for him. Please take comfort in that. No one should die alone in such an agonizing way. It's terrible the way society looks at this illness as something to be ashamed of. In turn, it forces victims to suffer more (needlessly) and take their secrets to the grave. If your friend's wish was to keep it private. I would respect that. It just shouldn't be that way.\n\nThank you for being there for him.",

It sounds like the world lost someone very special. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work in the medical field and have been a caretaker for many end stage AIDS patients. You are absolutely right about the stigma; it's revolting and ever present in society, even healthcare. I hope what I'm about to tell you gives you some semblance of comfort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNearly every AIDS patient I've had spends their final days alone. They are often suffering from addiction, mental illness, and the lifelong social isolation that comes with this horrible disease so there aren't too many friends and family around. I have sat and held their cold, boney hands too many times to count and the single thing they always express is that they \"wish X loved one was here\". You did more for your dear friend than you realize. Gifts and cards are nice but people know when they're about to move on and it's terrifying; I didn't know your friend but I can assure you that the time you dedicated to him in his final days meant more to him than you can ever realize.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, about your autism diagnosis: for whatever reason, the idea that people on the spectrum cannot feel empathy has been paraded around for a long time and it is absolutely false. Any experienced specialist will tell you that while you may experience empathy in a different way than neurotypicals, you are certainly capable of having feelings and loving others. It is blaringly obvious from your testimony to your late friend that you are both 1) capable of feeling love and empathy as well as 2) being able to express it in the way that people need. Being an empath is a gift to this world...use it, and do not let anyone, including a doctor, that you are incapable of feeling because your brain works differently.",

If you can afford it, therapy is a good step to take - you're grieving and you will need to talk to someone, and a therapist will be confidential and detached. And I'm sure his husband and sister-in-law would appreciate having you around as someone who was close to him, and if you're able to be emotional support for them, do that, but don't feel like you can't ever step away and if there's any part of that you need your own emotional support for, make sure you have that in place.

It's heartbreaking.\n\nYes, his husband will probably need support, but you need to ask in what form he'd like to receive it. Would he like to reminisce with you, or maybe prefer to be left alone to deal with his emotions first? Or would even seeing you be unbearable for a while, because you remind him of what he misses the most? Ask him how you can help. Most of the time, just being there works, but some people prefer to keep alone. In that case, ask if there's any practical stuff you can do for them. Don't know how close you are, but you could offer to clean up, cook, pay the bills, get groceries, do the laundry, or take care of their pets' walks etc.\n\nAs for the guy on the news and the homophobic assholes, there's nothing we can do.

Not to be selfish, but would love to read more about your relationship, seeing the impact it had on both of you, as well as on this platform. It might also serve as an outlet for your \"healing\" in whatever way you might see it. You are a beautiful person and did indubitably contribute positively to his life.\n\nI have been going through a lot lately. Sometimes l also question my capacity for empathy or my ability to be vulnerable with my loved ones, which has made it difficult to cultivate some of the new relationships (platonic) l had(ve). A while ago l met someone at a concert, had deep conversations, danced and ended up spending the whole  day with them. When we parted they repeatedly told me how nice, kind and genuine of a person l was, which made me uncomfortable as l struggle with receiving complements lol. They were relentless and l ended up taking these complements in and said \"thank you\". This person is in my city for a couple more months, and we've kept in touch. God knows l needed to hear that in that moment. You need to believe those kind words he said about you, you kept him \"alive\" in a way. I am sure you will make / are contributing positively to someone else's life nommatter how small. Sorry about your loss, it must be really tough. \ud83d\ude14",

Reading the post, I wanted to badly so visit, send flowers, to do anything to show him that dying is scary enough, he doesn't need to die alone. \n\nI have watched someone die slowly of cancer. She was 80 pounds when she died. It changes how you view death. It's rest and a release from a body that is no longer serving as a good host. \n\nI would suggest contacting the hospital or local hospice about a bereavement group. \n\nI also suggest you heal some of the wrong you saw in the world by volunteering with an AIDS organization or seeing it there is a program with your hospital where you can visit people who don't get visitors. Visiting people without family in nursing homes is also helpful. \n\nIf it feels healing not traumatic, see if your local hospice center would let you come in and visit people. My friend used to go and play piano music on the piano in the main room. Reading aloud, or just sitting with someone can be great. Dying is scary. Waking up a lone in a room people can be disoriented, and having someone there with them to orient them is so valuable. \n\nMy friend died in hospice, and it was an amazing place that didn't tiptoe around death.",

I know you\u2019re hurting, and it\u2019s ok to be sad. Your friend sounds like he was worthy of your grief. If you can build a friendship like this once, chances are you can again.

I am so sad he felt he couldn\u2019t tell anyone - I do not know anyone (or I\u2019m not aware of) anyone with the disease, or admittedly even that knowledgeable about it and I would never think of any sort of stigma attached to it (although I know he grew up at a different time). \n\nReaching out to his husband may be good - you don\u2019t have many who understand your loss and grief like he will. Maybe you would like to reach out to r/RandomActsofCards - so many of us would love to send you one I\u2019m sure even if it only brings you a temporary smile <3\n\nGrief sucks because you don\u2019t know what to do with it. And you never really figure it out you just learn to adapt with it being around. But allow yourself to grieve and do whatever you need to right now. Practice a lot of self care - see your doctor if you need to. \n\nPerhaps in the future you will want to contribute somehow to getting rid of the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS and getting awareness out.",

            "As a 35yo one year into widowhood, one of the things that has helped me the most is friends who were arguably my husband\u2019s friends first, or closer with him, taking the time to continue to show up, to honestly tell me they are sad too, and to tell me stories or memories I might not know in as much detail. \n\nThe people who keep making an effort after the initial  weeks or months of condolences fade are treasures and it helps me so much to know they haven\u2019t forgotten, and are still deeply affected and cared for my husband and still want to support me. Grief is very isolating. \n\nI can tell you really loved your friend and he had a huge positive influence on your life and I\u2019m sure his husband would want to hear more about that. \n\nMy dearest friend is a godsend because I can comfortably cry in front of him and he\u2019s not afraid of seeing grief. I can be honest. Your friend\u2019s husband might need that even more if he has almost no one to talk about the illness with because it sounds like you are one of the only people with whom they felt safe telling the medical truth. \n\nAbsolutely befriend your friend\u2019s husband if you can and if he seems to welcome it. And if you\u2019re not sure about something, just bluntly ask if it is working for him, reminding him that you\u2019re not going to be offended if he says he doesn\u2019t want to talk or doesn\u2019t want to see anyone right then.",

I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in the hospital, and during one stay, it looked like I wouldn\u2019t make it (obviously I luckily did) and those who came to see me during that time meant everything to me and made all the difference. \n\nOh a more related note, from my time volunteering at the local AIDS resource center, I know how much of a difference just being there to support people can make. \n\n\nI can\u2019t afford to buy you gold because I spend all my money in healthcare these days, but I want you to know that you\u2019re a good person and did the right thing.",

I knew she had a history of traumatic relationships and had hence decided not to date, but I also knew she had a pretty intense crush on a friend of a friend I had never met, James.\n\nWhen I moved to another state, we stayed in touch via phone calls. She told me that her feelings for James were becoming stronger, despite the fact that they had no contact. Soon, she began telling me that they were in love but his ex-girlfriend was preventing them from being together. Because these conversations became so odd, I stopped the calls and stepped away from the friendship. \n\nThis week, I visited my former city on an impromptu trip and met up with Wendy. She told me the exciting news that her and James were finally getting married after this ex had kept them apart so long. She showed me photos of a home he bought her, of horses he bought her, and of her in a wedding dress. She told me the name of the venue and invited me. Then she dropped the bombshell that James is apparently a millionaire. \n\nAll of this seemed off to me and when I got home, my concerns mounted. Her house was not packed despite the fact she is supposedly moving imminently. Money seems tight for her, she is living in relative squalor, if she has a millionaire fiance, why isn't he helping her? \n\nI did some digging. I found the house she showed me on Zillow, still for sale. I found the horses on a website for a local ranch that does tours. I called the venue and they told me they are unbooked on the supposed wedding date. All the available evidence tells me that she is not getting married. My gut tells me that her and James are not even in a relationship or have any contact. \n\nI don't know what to do next. Do I confront her? Do I warn James? Are these simply lies or are they delusions and the symptom of a serious mental illness? How do I help her?\n\nTLl;DR: My friend claims to be getting married, all evidence points to that being a lie or delusion. ",

You also aren\u2019t in a position to be the one coordinating everything that should be happening right now, and would need to find family or friends that live closer to help coordinate maybe.

Soon, she began telling me that they were in love but his ex-girlfriend was preventing them from being together.\n\nLike, this is straight up something a person with erotomania would say, look up erotomania/de clarembaults syndrome.  Alternatively, she's just lying and escalated to even more grandiose shit because you stepped away.  I had a friend like that and because I was so fucking nonplussed at everything she kept going and going and going with the reveals that, in hindsight, made no sense.

Basically you can play dumb and say that this confused you, and ask her if James isn't being totally honest with her about the house and horses and wedding etc etc.\n\nSadly from there it's on you to decide how you handle her reaction - is she an important enough friend to you that you feel the responsibility to confront her with her delusions? Or could you reach out to her friends or family and arrange some kind of intervention?",
            "She sounds delusional. My mom believed something very similar about the singer Richard Marx. Seriously, if you find out for sure it's not happening, do not confront her about it. In her mind this stuff may be real and there's no telling how she will react. ",
            "My experience with people who lie about things like this is very similar.  For some reason, they feel inadequate or embarrassed by themselves as they really are.  On some level, I think they believe they would endure mockery or just be unable to find people who accept them the way they are.  So, they conjure up stories to handle it with some of those stories being amazing and some being remarkably \"mundane\" to people who are around them (such as just going to a college when all their friends have gone to that college or achieving a certain career milestone when their friends are starting to accomplish the same).\n\nThey aren't delusional.  They're just so deeply insecure in how their life has turned out (possibly in comparison to those around them) that they think the truth would make them \"less than\" those around them.  People like that are constantly comparing their lives, even in miniscule ways, to those around them and thinking that they come up short instead of realizing that we all have our insecurities and compensations.  \n\nHer lies are pretty wild mostly because these are easily fact checked AND she gave you a date/time to be a viewer at the wedding.  What is she going to do if people actually show up?  Pay a guy to be James?  How long is this going to last?  She's willingly created this weird intersection in her storytelling where people will actually possibly \"interact\" head on with evidence of her lie (lack of wedding, lack of groom, lack of anything).  \n\nIf there IS a real James (not a groom, but someone she has built these fantasies around), then warn him for sure.  When liars involve real people into their lies, it comes crashing down rather quickly because the real person isn't willing to play a part in this game.  However, it might send her into a tailspin.  It's one thing to be a liar who thinks everyone believes the shit they're selling because everyone is too polite to say anything.  It's another to be a liar embarrasingly caught in the web of lies.\n",

This all sounds very similar to the situation that blew up on my friend -- he had a few interesting people in his life who turned out of be wholly invented, they started emailing is, it was a mess.\n\nIf you aren't close enough to her that you feel like you should intervene, maybe reach out to someone who is?

It would suck if you had to tell him she was making stories up and he told her off for it, but if that's what's happening she needs to get a wake up call from someone and he presumably deserved to be warned. Maybe she's stalking the man and this is evidence he could use to get a restraining order. Or maybe she lives on the other side of the country and is no real threat at all.

We know (specific story) didn't happen, and you spreading it around is hurting (person involved in story).\" At first she denied, came up with different lies, got a bit pissy. Then we showed her all the proof and she finally gave up. We'll catch her exaggerating every so often now, but it's pretty easy to remind her.\n \nThat story is very uncommon with liars, I think us having undeniable proof was the only reason it worked. I'd still be very careful, but since you do have proof (the pictures you found), the option is available for you. \n\nThen again someone I knew posted ultrasound pictures, I sent her the link she got it offline from. She blocked me, though the guy she said was the father didn't, so I sent it to him. Totally destroyed any friendship I had with the girl but was worth it to save the guy. ",

I just want you to know that I love you and care about you regardless of success or failure in your life. I hope you know that you can tell me the truth about things, I'll be there for you.\" - don't push her about \"the truth\" and don't call her out on her lies either, that could shame her a great deal. \n\nDon't feed them either, by asking a lot of questions or giving her a lot of praise for them.

I've known people sort of like this but not quite this extreme. They make up constant little lies all the time for attention. \n\nIF you know James at all call and congratulate him on the upcoming wedding.. see what he says and go from there. ",

You've heard from a lot of people who've had experience with pathological liars, but I haven't found any posts from people claiming the title themselves.\n\nHi.\n\nI used to be the kind of person you suspect Wendy is. I would lie all the time, sometimes about little, stupid things and sometimes about big, important things and I can just about guarantee that if Wendy is 41 and this deep into a fabrication, this is likely not her first whopper. \n\nIn the years you were friends did you notice a pattern of drama? Were there always emergencies or important things going on in her life? If so,though not conclusive it would be a point in favor of this being a fabrication of hers. It's also possible that she's become obsessed with James over the years, in which case he should be gently tipped off because taking photos of yourself in a wedding dress to prepare for the imaginary wedding to your  years-long crush is a level of disturbed that I never achieved, and even as a (recovered) liar that worries me. \n\nI would say go ahead and go to the wedding, just to see what is up. If it's all in her head she'll have an excuse already planned out, if she's being set up for something then she'll be devastated (and most likely a transfer of cash from her to him will be involved). \n\nIf she's telling stories my next step would be to contact James. Normally I wouldn't advocate getting involved in a pathological liar's web because it really does no good, but again, the level of obsession she's displayed over several years is concerning (I could never invest in a lie that long).

Tried to make us all believe she had a secret sister that no one in her family knew about. Very puzzling at the time but after studying 4 years of psychology, I find this consistent with certain personality disorders, particularly the Histrionic kind. It's difficult to go about this, but they should seek professional help if things like this affect their work and relationships. You could suggest that during a sit down with them. Confrontation is tricky because you can't predict how it will go, but it is up to you. Make sure your intentions are not out of anger for lying but rather to help her. Also maybe tell James, since it does concern him in a serious way, but after you have sought some more information from your friend. ",

He wouldve had two girls hitting on him even tho he was obese, he would tell tales on how he threw some guy into a river for picking on another guy, he wouldve been offered a rare comic book worth millions by some old lady and refuse it due to the kindness of his heart. \nThe thing with people like that is that they dont get better. Theyll keep escalating and escalating and eventually theyll be telling people tales about how you were hitting on them but they refused to bang you and how they are specialists at literally everything you do.\n\nYou are going to stop respecting her as a person as things keep escalating, so its probably better to have a heart to heart to her if you care about her. \nNon confronting them leads to the escalation.",

It doesn't sound like a delusion to me because she had to consciously come up with these photos, etc. It sounds more like she is in a bad place and developing these fantasies for herself and others is a way of coping. I personally would caution against confronting her because I don't think any good can come of it. I would just go along with it and congratulate her on her good fortune, say she deserves it, etc., and then just redirect the conversation elsewhere. I think people get really stuck on wanting to call someone out in these types of situations, but letting it go is usually for the best...\n\nBTW, depending on how close your relationship is, if you can gently guide her toward psychiatric treatment, that would probably be for the best as well... maybe you could say something like \"Wow, moving, marriage, and new horses! You are going through a lot of transitions right now! Maybe it would be good to have an outside party to talk to about how you are adjusting to all this?\"",

If you've never met him/seen him, and she's apparently \"not in contact with him\", that means he doesn't exist.\n\nThink about it. She made him a \"long distance relationship\" because she knew people would see into her lie if he was never around. Him being long distance or just as ambiguous as she can means she had an excuse every time people ask \"where is he? can we meet him?\"\n\nI had a friend just like Wendy back in high school, but instead of it being a millionaire boyfriend looking to get married, it was some guy from New York (long distance so we wouldn't ask to see him) who apparently got her pregnant, until she eventually miscarried about a month in (so we wouldn't wonder why she's not visibly pregnant after a few months). She even fabricated emails from him and his also fake brothers (when I caught her in the act of faking emails, she didn't even admit it was all a lie; she just made up ANOTHER lie claiming she had to pretend to be these people to \"protect their identities from the people who wanted to hurt them\". yeah ok lol) Eventually the boyfriend died from some heroic act involving police brutality (dying so we would NEVER see him) and she started dating his brother who also lived in New York. Did I mention she used their names for her characters in her fanfictions? By the next year, the story had fizzled and she had stopped talking about it. I'm assuming she grew out of it.\n\nThe difference between her and Wendy is that Wendy is an adult (my friend was like, 14/15 at the time). Everything about her story, including James, is a lie (and if James is real, then that makes it worse because she's obviously making up stories about the both of them) and shouldn't be chalked up to \"silly high schooler nonsense\".\n\n\n\n",

            "After reading OP story a couple of times, I do not believe \"James\" is scamming her. Either she is dillusional (Morelli OITNB) and stalking \"James\"  Or She's actually got a crush on O.P and is trying to make him Jealous. I wonder about that because he stated she had had some pretty traumatic relationships , and that's why he/they didn't date. It makes me think that otherwise he would be attracted to her and the stories of other \"traumatic relationships\" might fall right in with this big story about James. My guess is she started out telling O.P these terrible stories about other men, trying to garner sympathy...he was  kind enough to make her think he may really like her as more than a friend, She took it as him being \"interested\" in her and is trying to make him \"jealous\". Yes she IS dillusional , but it's not a new thing, their relationship started out that way....he just wasn't aware of it until it intensified. I don't think anyone rational is going to think some guy who she obviously hasn't spent enough time with to have a photo of them together would take it at face value he bought her a mansion, and horses she's never seen. He has planned the wedding, picking the venue without her present. All while she's poor and living in squalor.  She is the one with issues. He just hadn't noticed until now. He needs to respectfully decline the invite. Then wait and see what happens afterwards. He can always text her asking about the new house....get \"confirmation \" she's moved. All while parked accross the street from her old house to see if she's still there. If she is...she's been playing him from the beginning. Drive away and change your number. Lying is not a crime, and there is not much he can do for her mental health as he is a \"target\" . If he keeps in contact with her he is feeding the fantasy. She could start getting angry with him for some nutty reason, and  he could potentially get in some version of a fatal attraction. I'd be willing to bet if he were able to contact any of her old friends or co-workers, even family members...he would find out she's done something similar. It would definitely be wise to see if anyone has ever taken a restraining order against her. Maybe one of her \"traumatic\" previous relationships involved HIM taking out a restraining order on HER. Especially if she told O.P there had been abuse. I could just be full of sh*t....but I don't think so. I too would like an update. ",

Yet every now and then depending on the discussion, I'll get a random story about herself that is really dramatic.  \n\n\nLike the fact she's a 100% hetero woman who does not find attraction in other women, but she told me a tale recently that she slept with TWO women and had girlfriends in the past (despite telling me - her gay female friend - that she does not and has never wanted women).  \n\n\nOr the time she told me she stood up to the office bully who made a girl cry and 'everyone clapped'.  \n\n\nYeah the clapping stories don't just pop up on Tumblr lol.  \n\n\nEnd this friendship. Seriously, let her deal with herself and her own crazy brain.  \n",
            "I've known a couple of people who compulsively lied like this. Chances are this James person doesn't even exist. \n\nBest thing you can do is just step away from the friendship again and have nothing to do with her. People who compulsively lie tend to drag others into trouble with them. ",

I remember exactly how confused and mentally exhausted I was at that point. Reading the responses and having my feelings validated by a bunch of internet strangers gave me the confidence to know I wasn\u2019t being too sensitive (f that). It also got me out of a constant state of rumination about what was happening to me and why I felt so off and not myself and led me to act.\n\nI told him I wanted space and that if we were both trying our best and our relationship felt like this we had a huge problem. I also told him that at some point he had stopped treating me like his girlfriend and started treating me like a defective human being and I was over it and wouldn\u2019t continue to invest my time and energy into someone who treated me this way. \n\nThose first few days I spent alone were like an f-ing vacation. I couldn\u2019t believe how amazing it felt to do simple, every day things without his constant interference and judgement. At the same time,  I did start to notice some of the things I was blaming him for being critical of me were really areas I was insecure and being critical of myself. I spent more time over the next few months investing in myself and and improving certain areas of my life.\n\nOur relationship seemed to improve slightly over the next few months. The micromanaging and criticism really improved or I thought they improved. He might have just changed tactics. I think he started triangulating and upping the ante with the \u201cinnocent\u201d insults. I think I had also gotten better at dealing with it and probably lowered the bar even more.\n\nIn the fall I had my first ever sciatica flare up. It was agonizing pain almost constantly. It lasted 8 weeks and I was trying everything - physical therapy, anti inflammatories, bio freeze, ice, not moving, powering through the pain. He was over it all after a few weeks and starting treating me like I was a lazy slob. I felt so scared and helpless about how much pain I was in and if It was ever going to get better or would I need surgery. The added stress of still trying to be a good partner was horrible. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why this instance of his selfishness had more impact, but I felt something change inside of me in a profound way. Of course when I tried to talk to him about it, it went very poorly. The argument ended when he mocked me for crying and asked me why I couldn\u2019t talk to him like a normal person .\n\nI can\u2019t remember when it started but I began to have physical responses during any kind of conflict with him. Sort of like fight or flight maybe? My hands start shaking, I start feeling overwhelmed and confused, my stomach is flipping, and eventually the tears come.\n\nThis comment from my original post rings true:\n\n\u201cIt seriously sounds like a low key gateway to emotional abuse. I can't imagine his BS only starts and stops at just hacking away at OPs self worth and then gaslighting her about what's happening.\n\nThose people get worse as the relationship goes on, not better.\u201d\n\nThe BS certainly didn\u2019t stop there. There were so many instances during our relationship where I felt he had lied to me. There were constant interactions where my instincts told me he was being inauthentic or he was hiding something or not giving me all the details. The addictions. The attention he gave women on social media. Always needing someone to blame. An almost embarrassing inability to take accountability.\n\nI still feel pretty conflicted about what I did. I went through his phone. I started by looking for a couple specific times in the beginning of our relationship where my mind had flagged something as off or a lie but I had no idea why. Like when he insisted we go drop a bottle of champagne off to a friend of his as a congratulations for getting a new job. At the time I couldn\u2019t place what felt off about this. I looked at texts from this specific date and now I know that we were really there to deliver cocaine. When I was able to confirm what my instincts told me were lies it was off to the races.\n\nIt was all pretty bad. He was on tinder for the first 6 months we were together, bumble for 9, and plenty of fish 11. All texts with other women deleted. Secret drug use. It\u2019s hard to even remember everything but I tried to just confirm what I had felt to be lies. \n\nThere is definitely a ton of anger and sadness but more than anything else I felt relief. Everything my instincts have been telling me since the beginning have been accurate and I have been fighting a losing battle against them. It felt freeing. \n\nWhy have I continued this relationship in spite my instincts for 2.5 years and endless stress and chaos? My hair has been thinning since the 3 month mark in our relationship. I\u2019ve had brain fog and memory problems despite being known for my iron trap memory. Sleeping issues. Weight fluctuations. My body has been physically rejecting this relationship. Somehow I either couldn\u2019t admit that it was him or I was really that out of it. I\u2019m starting to try and unwind it all in therapy.  I have had 3 sessions so far and am scheduled weekly for the foreseeable future. What I have learned so far is I was taught to not trust my feelings as a child by my Dad, who is very likely a narcissist. I\u2019m really excited to work on my toxic patterns and behaviors in therapy and make the relationship I have with myself better and my priority.\n\nWe have been living in separate bedrooms for a couple weeks. The initial confrontation was horrible and I hurled some really rough insults and names at him. A few weeks ago I was thinking that I would have a final discussion about why we were breaking up and the logistics of him moving out etc. It still almost felt like I was going to have to convince him that this was a good enough reason to break up. \n\nAfter a deadline for work is over in the next couple days I\u2019m going to tell him the relationship is over because I want it to be. And I do. I\u2019m going to offer to pay for movers so I have an exact date he will be gone. I am nervous about his reaction and scared of what he might say to hurt me but I have never been more certain I\u2019m making the right decision  so I know I\u2019ll be able to handle whatever happens.\n\nAgain, thank you endlessly to anyone who took the time to comment on my original post or reached out. I felt seen and heard that day in a way that woke me up and nudged me to really start paying attention and stop turning everything inward. \n\nTL;DR I wasn\u2019t being too sensitive; we are incompatible. He was not only making my life a living hell with all the criticism, gaslighting, and passive aggressive jabs, he was also a liar and a cheater. Coming to terms with all of it and working on myself in therapy.\n\nOh and one more thing - In my original post I played dumb about what he was insinuating when commenting about the shorts with the wet waistband. I was so paranoid at that time I wanted to see if other people came to the same conclusion that I had. When I reread my post that stuck out to me as sad.",

A couple things jumped out at me in your post that I want to draw your attention to as well. \n\n>I wasn\u2019t being too sensitive; we are incompatible.\n\nNo honey, you are not incompatible; he is a lying, abusive fucknugget. Incompatible suggests that no one did anything wrong; it just didn't work out. That's not the case here. He did things wrong. A lot of things. Lying, cheating, insulting, manipulating, gaslighting, to name a few. That's abuse. Call it what it is - it hurts at first, but I promise it's empowering in the long run. \n\n\n>Those first few days I spent alone were like an f-ing vacation. I couldn\u2019t believe how amazing it felt to do simple, every day things without his constant interference and judgement.\n\nThis is the moment when you know there is something deeply, deeply wrong with the relationship. This happened to me the one time I dated someone who was (I think) a proper narcissist. We'd been together for about 6 months or so, and things were rocky. A festival came to my town related to my passion (I don't want to say hobby, bc it's way bigger than that for me), so I told him I was going to be super busy for that weekend (I think thurs-sun) and that I'd see him on Monday. I even took the time off work so I could properly focus on the festival. To my surprise, he respected that and left me alone. It was SUCH AN ENORMOUS RELIEF. I felt more alive than I had in basically our whole relationship. More energy, less stress, the whole 9 yards. Stupidly, I went back and spent another two months trying to \"fix\" us, and made several other bad decisions before finally breaking up with him in a scene like nothing I've ever seen outside of reality TV. But I learned that if taking a few days away from your relationship makes you feel relief... It's probably time to end the relationship. I hope you can also take some important lessons from this so you know what not to tolerate in future relationships!\n\nETA: I also second what everyone is saying about having a friend there when you end it. The giant scene that was the end of my relationship was when my friend and I came to get my shit out of his house (yep, there's one of the stupid decisions - somehow, I ended up moving in with the fuckwaffle). The only reason we were successful is because we tag-teamed my ex. He would come to me and beg and plead, or stand in my way, and my friend would grab boxes and take them to the van. Then he would stop to yell at my friend, and I would grab more stuff. It would have been physically impossible for me to do this on my own.",

Let him move out, change the locks, and wipe him out of your life. There are bad people and you met one, as simple as that.",

            "*\".. sense of uneasiness when I\u2019m doing practically anything in his presence.\"*\n\nDo you still feel this way being around him? If the answer is yes, then get out ASAP. Simple as that. He has some serious issues.. and things will only get worse. I was with a guy who was extremely critical to the point where it drove me insane and it made me sick. I should have left him long before he finally broke up with me after a year and a half, but I was relieved when it was over.\n\nEDIT: It's not about if you're compatible or not, he's just an emotionally/mentally abusive asshole. Really reminds me of my ex.. controlling, condescending, mind-numbingly critical, nothing is good enough, gaslighting, invalidating feelings, etc. These kinds of men are very insecure and have some kind of superiority complex.. they must be avoided at all costs. I learned my lesson the hard way by ignoring the red flags early in the relationship. The peace of mind I feel with him gone is indescribable.",
            "OP I am seconding (or thirding) all the comments that you need to have someone there when you do break up with him. I went through a similar relationship that I ended back in October and it was a fucking nightmare even AFTER I broke up with him as he would not accept it and kept showing up at my apartment until I threatened him with a restraining order. The final straw with me breaking up with him was an outburst where we had a fight and he became violent (not with me, but easily could have been) and he threw stuff around and screamed. Please please please go through with leaving him, you will be so much better off without him. Lean on your reliable friends and family to help you through it. Best of luck.",

My ex still tries to contact me even through fake accounts where it is obvs it is him and he emails me and sends me money I never accept and it has been 3 years. I have told him never contact me again and it has gotten to the point where I just have to no contact him. I think that is what u r going to have to do. It's also important to know that u might be addicted to the dopamine of when he is actually nice to you. They can make ppl addicted to being in contact with them and addicted to their love bombing through the emotional abuse cycle. So be strong you can do it and if you want to talk msg me anytime.

It lasted 8 weeks and I was trying everything - physical therapy, anti inflammatories, bio freeze, ice, not moving, powering through the pain.\n\nAs someone who lives in chronic back pain, I just want to tell you I understand the fear. The fear it will never get better, the fear you might live a crippled life because you can only imagine it can get worse. \n\nFor whatever it's worth, over time, I do have good days now. Not all hope is lost. The pressure man.... I check the weather apps and mentally prepare myself for an increase in atmospheric pressure. That triggers flare ups for me sometimes. I hope you find a solution that works for you.\n\n> There were constant interactions where my instincts told me he was being inauthentic or he was hiding something or not giving me all the details. The addictions. The attention he gave women on social media. Always needing someone to blame. An almost embarrassing inability to take accountability.\n\nNever let a man ever again sway you from your intuition. It's a gift that's more often right than wrong in these kinds of circumstances. It may take time to heal, a lot of things might be hard at first, but that intuition is there to serve you. With healing, you will get better mind and body.    \n\n> What I have learned so far is I was taught to not trust my feelings as a child by my Dad, who is very likely a narcissist.\n\nDing, ding, ding. \n\nHere's the thing, as much as you want to confront him all they do is DARVO. By him, I mean this excuse for a man you unfortunately ended up dating, trauma bonded to, and somehow stuck with I would guess in the kindest way out of honest ignorance. You don't know and you can't see these things until you do. No it wasn't your fault. Now that you know, you can take your own power back.\n\nConfronting nasty people about their nasty behavior tends to get them just trying to deflect onto you rather than ever take any accountability. It's not worth it. No contact + breaking it off and getting away with someone you trust NOT to be a flying monkey is as /u/Sedorner said, good advice.

She brought her friend, who was also my friend too, and they were packing her stuff.  But also giggling like a couple of teenagers? All I did was sit and catch up on some emails from work, not paying attention to either of them. After about 3 hours, she had all of her things in boxes. She tried to take some things that were mine, and I told her calmly that she didn\u2019t pay for it, so to please leave it with me. I contacted the nice couple we rent our house from and they were extremely supportive and are letting me change all of the locks, so my buddy and I are going to do that tonight. He is also helping me move my desk and electronics to the spare bedroom, since my ex used it as a closet and storage space. When she left, I finally saw some remorse, but I think she was just being nice to me because she was happy to be going to that guy\u2019s house. She hugged me goodbye, and I let her because that\u2019s my way of getting physical closure. Whenever she hugged me, she would run her fingers through my hair, and she did it for the last time today. As she left I felt sad, but I also felt optimistic because I can now live in peace without carrying that burden of wondering if she is cheating on me. From now on, my life is just me, my family and friends and of course my pets. Thank you all for the kind words and encouragement. If anything else happens, I\u2019ll try to remember to update. But until then, I\u2019ll see you all around. \n\nEdit #2: Wow thank you guys so much for the words of wisdom and support. To answer some frequently asked questions, since there\u2019s too many responses to reply to individually I\u2019ll post them here. \n1. After this, I don\u2019t have any intentions to ever get back together with her. She made it known who and what she wants, so I am going to put all of my energy towards my job and family and friends. Even if she does come crawling back, I will not have her number and she will have no way to contact me.\n2. I wasn\u2019t her first boyfriend but I was her first serious one. We got together when we were 19. I met her while I attended college and she worked at this restaurant just outside of campus. We were each other\u2019s first couple milestones. Such as moving in together, getting animals together, giving a good part of our lives to each other.\n3. I know there is better for me out there. Thank you guys for picking me up. For now, I will only focus on furthering my career and being the man of my family since my dad passed away in July. When it\u2019s time for me to date, I will know. In time, I will find the right one, a great one. \n4. With the suggestions of my friends and most of you, I am going to get tested Monday morning. I don\u2019t think there was anything being passed around, but you can never be too careful. So yes, Monday morning I\u2019m going to make sure nothing is wrong. \n\nEdit: I appreciate the advice about how NFP is not a form of contraceptive, I get that. It\u2019s definitely not something to do if you don\u2019t want children. However before this cheating and sneaking around began, we were headed towards marriage (me planning on proposing for our 6 year anniversary in January) and wanting to start a family right away. For us and the state of our relationship at the time, and specifically for my latex allergy, we were comfortable with doing that. We were committed to it and had no problems or scares during the 5 years we were doing it. It doesn\u2019t work for everyone, so please be careful. Please, guys, the last thing I want is to be scolded that I shouldn\u2019t have used that method. I\u2019m just looking for some pick me ups and kind words. Let\u2019s put all that other stuff aside. Thank you.\n\n\nSo update as of yesterday, I asked her how come she had grown so distant. She didn\u2019t give me any sort of answer, so I just asked. \u201cIs there another guy?\u201d I got her to confess she had been seeing a guy she met on tinder. She told me that I just wasn\u2019t the one for her. She got no satisfaction from me anymore and that I was just a weight in her life that kept her down. For the record, I haven\u2019t stopped her from pursuing her dream career, even though we sacrificed an income for her to do so. I have always been respectful of her needs and wants. I like to think I have been a decent boyfriend to her. She asked for an immediate break up, because she was gonna move some stuff into the new guys house. I told her that was fine. But she had to get her stuff out at once. I didn\u2019t want her to come back two and three times a week to get her things. She wants nothing to do with our pets so I am keeping the cat and giving the dog to my mom, who could use some company since my dad passed away a few months ago. It\u2019s really hard to see how cold she was. No tears or sense of regret. So tomorrow (Saturday) she is taking all of her stuff in her dad\u2019s pickup truck and moving to that guy\u2019s house. I asked her how long this had been going on, and she said 2 months. It\u2019s a little bit nauseating because we had still been sleeping together in that time. I appreciate those of you looking out for me, telling me to use condoms, thanks! But we were doing that Natural Family Planning, where she tracked her fertile days and all that, so we weren\u2019t gonna get pregnant unless we actually tried. I\u2019m sad because this is a woman I\u2019ve grown to love and essentially have grown with as an individual. I just can\u2019t believe how much she\u2019s changed over these past couple of weeks. Hopefully she finds what she truly wants and is happy.\n\nTLDR- my girlfriend I suspected of cheating on me confessed. We broke up and she is moving in with her new guy.",

It's fresh for you - it's old news for her. \n\n> I appreciate those of you looking out for me, telling me to use condoms, thanks! But we were doing that Natural Family Planning, where she tracked her fertile days and all that, so we weren\u2019t gonna get pregnant unless we actually tried. \n\nOh boy... um, please, PLEASE do not be this naive in the future. First of all... she was cheating on you, so you already should have realized you shouldn't have trusted her. Second of all... NFP isn't anywhere nearly as effective as actual contraceptives. I have a friend - devout Catholic - who practices NFP with his wife and they both swear by it. They've had 4 kids in the past decade, which they explain as \"God knowing it was the right time(s) for us, when science told us it wasn't!\" The human body is weird, and can human observations can be faulty.

Then when we were ready to try for our children, we conceived each time in a month or two. We have 3 kids and it worked for us for years and we got pregnant easily when we were ready to, all three planned. He did have a vasectomy when we were done having kids though. \n\nAnyway, just saying don\u2019t let people birth control shame you lol, we felt the same.

Over a year later she calls me up one night and tries to get back into my life. By that time, I was dating the girl who would become my wife (married 19 years now). I gave her the cold shoulder and pretty much sent the message to get out of my life.\n\n8 years later this girl married some seriously ugly dude that must have been 10 years oder than her.

Started talking to this other dude before our relationship was over and started something with him as soon as we broke up. I didn't find out until about a month after we had broken up. I was just a sad sack of crap because I thought it was all my fault for losing her up until that point. Even after that point it felt like it took over a year before I found myself again. Until it got to a point where I was somewhat proud of the person I was.\n\nI remember the lack of closure being one of the reasons that prevented me from really moving on. I never got my answers and I dont think you should expect to get yours. \n\nI just moved on knowing that she decided to cut me off from her life. She had a choice to be a human being and a friend, but she decided that being cold was the best way to get what she wanted.\n\nShe chose to stop caring about you. I know it's going to take a while to really get over it, but I hope that one day you'll be able to choose to cut her out of your life and head space. She doesn't deserve that attention anymore. \n\nUse this opportunity to improve upon yourself. Are you happy with your health? This is your chance to treat yourself better by learning how to cook or exercising. Are you happy with how you look? Best time to start figuring out your sense of fashion is now. Do you wish you engaged in more hobbies? Figure out what you like and start having fun experimenting. Did you lose contact with some good friends and wish to hang out again? Take initiative to include these people in your life again.\n\nIt's ok to feel emotions about this. I fucking cried, got mad, reminisced about happier days. There will be some days where you feel fine, happy, jolly without her. And you will have some days where you miss the fuck out of her and wish you could talk to her. It's not going to be a constant up and up. Don't talk to her. Make it harder for yourself to talk to contact her. She already made her decision to leave you in such a cold way, and after 5 fucking years of your life. \n\nAt one point you'll realize that you're both not the same ppl that started the relationship. Things change. You'll realize that maybe what you miss isn't really her, per say, you just miss being in a relationship.\n\nI know it might be hard to see now, but you'll get through this. If you ended up reading this, know you're not alone. Better days will come, but only if we work towards it. Good luck man.",

Hell maybe even get her to sign something saying you\u2019re taking full ownership. Double hell maybe get that notarized.\n\nAlso I just noticed how recently your dad passed I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with these two things back to back.",
            "What goes around, comes around OP. She\u2019ll get hers. \n\nThat same guy who was cool with her sneaking around behind your back will be cool with doing the same with someone else.",
            "So basically she started cheating on you with some dude from tinder right after your dad died??? Holy shit dude, I am so sorry. My dad died last year and my boyfriend was my rock...I can\u2019t imagine going through this so soon after losing a parent. You deserve so much better. I know it hurts now but I\u2019m so glad you got away from such an awful person.",
            "It\u2019s really hard to see how cold she was. \n\n\nThat part is easy for women because they can not love you the way a man love a woman. When they have determined that you no longer provide what they want they turn off their emotions for you.",
            "She will be back soon. Do not be plan \"B\".",
            "Don't take her ass back if she comes back.",
            "I'm sorry to hear that man. Specially since your father passed away not so long ago. I'm sure it must be hard to be in your position right now. But things will get better, and trust me, you are a good person and worth it. If she really did all that, being so cold, then she really has some issues. Nothing you could do to prevent that.   \n\n\nWish you all the luck and a happy life, wish I'm sure you will have. :)",
            "Well, if she ever realizes what she did was wrong, and messages back to try and reconcile, you can respond with:\n\n\"You could not live with your failure. And where did that bring you? Back to me.\"",
            "I know exactly what kind of dude just preyed on her, she is gonna be fucked up yo. He told her every sweet nothing she wanted to hear and she is infatuated, moving directly in? I that's gonna be hell of a shit storm. Well if she was looking on tinder you dodged a bullet and 18 years of child support.",
            "Branch swinger detected.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened but it\u2019s over now and the best thing you can do is block her on everything and move on with your life.",
            "Once she's moved out, change the locks.",
            "Honestly... good for fucking you man! I\u2019m sure it does hurt that she was so emotionless but this dude she met was off tinder. I GUARANTEE she will be with this guy for a bit and then realize what a great guy you were. But by the time she figures it out, you would have built a great life for yourself and find a girl that will love you correctly.\n\nBuild your empire and thrive mf.. you should look at this as a blank canvas!",
            "She\u2019s doomed so naive of her to move in with a guy she\u2019s only met for two months lol!!!. you dodged a bullet right there! Have an excellent life!! You deserve much much better.",
            "This is really sad. But I'm sure you'll get through it. I hope you take time for yourself and just heal from what happened. And remember there was nothing wrong with you. Most people who are cheated on, tend to think that but it's not the case. Cheaters are just bad people who don't know what loyalty is and have their own issues. She was the bad one and isn't the one for you. It's probably going to suck for a while but just focus on everything good in your life. And you got to keep your cat, which personally I think is a great. I know you'll heal from this and be much much happier. \n\nAnd if, she does come back(which is likely), stay strong . You can forgive her but that doesn't mean you have to take her back. Never forget, like they say. You're better off without someone like that.",
            "Very sorry my dude, but bullet dodged. Take time to yourself and work on healing. It'll take time, but you'll be fine. You're young enough you'll have no problem with your future",
            "I really don't understand people. All the best bro.",
            "Wow\n\nFirst of all, OP, you're a champ. Not a lot of men would be as level headed as you are and I'm proud of you for being calm and assertive through all of this. I'm proud of you for drawing the line with your ex and making her get the stuff out immediately and in one trip. \n\nSecond of all: I'm sorry. I'm sorry for having to be affected by the faux convenience of dating apps rather than a partner willing to put work in to salvage what you build. I'm sorry she didn't seem sorry or care at all about what this does to both of you as well as your pets. I'm sorry the standards of relationships seem like they force you to keep your partner entertained before someone else does it better. \n\nLastly, I'm happy for you. I'm happy that you were able to dodge this bullet without children. I'm happy that you're so hopeful of the future and positive about the potential it entails. And I'm happy that you're an example of a bad thing happening to a good man and not changing the type of person you are because of it.\n\nYou're an inspiration to many and I hope you continue to be awesome. Here's to happiness, my friend.",
            "You are thinking the right way. Keep it up and you'll be good.",
            "OP, please give us an update after she moves on Saturday please?",
            "She's been seeing this guy for two months, so essentially she started cheating right after your dad died? What a horrid piece of shit. I'm sorry for loss, OP. Good on you for confronting this- you seem like a very nice person, and you deserve much better.",
            "Wow moving straight in with a new guy, thats amazing. I honestly believe most of the population are walking around with some short circuit or mental disorder. Incredible!",
            "WOW!!! Moving in after 2 months. That healthy relationship will surely be long and prosperous!",
            "Guaranteed she will come crawling back, and when she does give her the boot but be kind and courteous about how much better you are without her.",
            "The thing is with cheaters, if they cheat on you they\u2019ll either be cheated on or live a horrible life of thinking they will be, as trust will never be fully there for them in a relationship. So glad you\u2019re away from this. I wish you all the happiness in the world!",
            "Reading your story has really hit an struck an emotional chord for me. I really feel for you man, 6 years together and she just leaves you for some random on tinder? That just goes to show how fucked up dating is for our generation. The fact that people will up and leave a life they built with each other and to have been cheating on you with him for two fucking months while still with you? Fuck her, you deserve so much better then that and later on down the road when this bullshit tinder relationship falls through she\u2019s gonna be crying alone looking back on her life and wishing she had that safe place with you and your pets, I guarantee it. I wish you happy healing OP, it\u2019s gonna be a rough ride for many many months maybe even years but personal growth often comes from those uncomfortable places. It\u2019s time to put yourself first and become the greatest version of yourself you can be! Best of luck to you.",
            "Left you for a guy she just met on Tinder two months ago?\n\nGuaranteed she'll be back.\n\nBe sure to remember all this when she is.",
            "*bro hug* \nSo sorry my dude. It'll get easier with time. When (not if) she comes crawling back come read these posts you made. You deserve better.",
            "This sucks but looking on the bright side, better now than after being married (with kids). You\u2019ll find the right partner in due time and this will be a blessing in disguise when you spend the rest of your life with the person you are meant to meet and be with.",
            "You should thank the lord for not getting her pregnant.",
            "Stay strong OP! Ure amazing!",
            "Remember sir. Remember that feeling when she waltz back into your life in some fashion.",
            "57 years maybe and ask her why",
            "Wow, she is garbage. Nobody deserves to be blindsided and discarded like that. Props to you for being so strong dude, that would destroy me.",
            "I\u2019m late to the party. But I wanted to congratulate you on your maturity on the situation. I\u2019m 22F. Broke up with my ex a year ago. My mind could not formulate thoughts properly on how to deal with it. I\u2019m ashamed of it. I\u2019m just now out of the rut. \n\nI don\u2019t even have the positivity that you have in finding another. But I should stop saying shit like that. Good on you for being a bigger man and not talking bad about your ex on the internet.I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard, and be well.",
            "You have done the best thing for you, now move on and wish the best for her.  There is enough hurt in the world to wish hurt on each other.",
            "I like how she didn't have the decency to break-up with you before deciding to install Tinder. \n\nCoward. And the giggling was disgusting.",

Period.  It needs to be either her birth control (IUD, pill, etc), or condoms.  NFP is not going to be a safe way to ensue children don't get created.",
            "Well, it looks like you dodged a bullet. \n\nBy the way: natural family planning can work depending on who's doing it. Many, many (I would say most) people's bodies won't adhere to the assumptions people make when they plan their sex. I wouldn't rely on it at all. You two got lucky here.",
