        "selftext": "My cousin is pregnant with a married man\u2019s baby. It\u2019s been a huge scandal in our family, but my uncle has been doing his hardest to convince everyone that my cousin is the real victim in this situation. He thinks that the married man, who has small children with his wife, should abandon them and take care of my cousin and their baby instead.\n\nFor some unexplainable reason, he has latched onto my husband to try and push this narrative that the married man has more obligation to his mistress than his wife. At first, my uncle coaxed my husband into agreeing by not giving him the whole story. I was furious and exploded at him which made my cousin cry.\n\nNow, my uncle is obsessed with the idea of my husband having a mistress.\n\nIn 2019, we took a family vacation with my extended family. During that vacation, my husband got a lot of female attention. This isn\u2019t unusual for him; he has always got a lot of attention, so he\u2019s used to it. There was this one particular girl though, that brazenly invited my husband to her room in front of my uncles/cousins. My uncle keeps bringing it up and mentioning how my husband must get a lot of invites like that and travelling alone must get lonely at times. Pre-COVID my husband used to travel a lot and sometimes for long stretches.\n\nHe also has outright said that my husband is in the perfect position to have several mistresses and he doubts he would ever get caught. He has asked him if he has a second family in a different country and has \u201cjokingly\u201d suggested he leave if his other \u201cwife\u201d is better looking than me.\n\nOne of the worst parts is that two of my male cousins have asked my husband if they can have the numbers of anyone he is bored with because they believe he is fooling around because my uncle is going on about it with so much confidence so often.\n\nI\u2019m honestly at my breaking point here. My husband has outright told my uncle that what he is saying is inappropriate, but my uncle tries to act like it\u2019s all one big joke. I can\u2019t go no contact with my uncle because my elderly grandparents live with him and he won\u2019t let me see them if I do.\n\nWhat are my other options here? How can I make him stop?\n\nTL;DR \u2013 My cousin is pregnant with a married man\u2019s baby. Now my uncle is obsessed with implying my husband is having an affair and that if he gets his mistress pregnant, he should leave me for her.",

            "My ultimate advice is to make a huge thing about it. Next time he brings it up say something like\n\n\u201cWhy do you think cheating on your spouse is okay? Is there someone you\u2019d like to tell us Uncle? Is this your way of telling us that you have a secret affair-child that you have hidden away? Or that your current wife actually use to be your mistress?\u201d\n\nLets see how much he likes it. You and your husband, and your mother apparently, have already tried being civil about this. If he can say it to you, why can\u2019t you say it to him?",
            "Both you and your husband need to put your foot down. Any time your uncle brings this up say something like \"Wow, [uncle], what is wrong with you?\" And then leave the conversation. You don't have to completely cut ties, but you do need to give him the message that everything stops when he brings this up and that he only gets to talk to you if he's being appropriate.",
            "Has your husband tried the old 'play dumb' trick where everything that comes out of your uncle's mouth is something he doesn't understand and needs explanations on? \n\nIt's like when someone tells you an unfunny racist 'joke' and you keep asking them to explain it because you don't get it, when you're actually just letting them lengthen the rope they're hanging themselves with.",
            "What did he say when you asked him WHY he was doing this?",
            "When playing nice doesn\u2019t work, play truthful but not nice. Call. Shit. Out.\n\n\u201cLook, Uncle. I get you married your mistress and as a result of your own life choices, your daughter didn\u2019t grow up respecting marriage vows and is now a knocked up mistress. I know you think it\u2019s entertaining to imagine all the opportunities you see my husband and other men have to cheat and because you have zero morals when it comes to being married you pretend no one else does either, and that may make you think your bad choices are legitimate. They aren\u2019t. We don\u2019t find your commentary funny or entertaining any more than you find it funny or entertaining your daughter is going to be a single mother because of your family\u2019s cavalier attitude towards marriage.\u201d \n\nAnd then, any and every time he starts yapping, just look him dead in the eyes and say \u201cstop.\u201d \n\nAnd that\u2019s the most respectful response or way I can see handling it for you, because the way I\u2019d handle it would be much more explosive, have a fuckload of profanity, and it\u2019d involve telling him to keep his shitty opinions and life experiences to himself.",
            "Gah, your uncle sounds horrible.  Passing off an insult as a joke is still an insult, just without repercussions. It's great that your husband does not give your uncle any room but the fact that your uncle has now enlisted his kin in this thinking is a line too far.  Kindness hasn't worked.  Firm denials haven't worked.  Time to get ugly.  If your uncle denies access to your grandparents, then your mom/dad need to step in.  What your uncle is saying and doing is not okay.",
            "Is your parent that\u2019s related to him still in your life? Maybe they could talk some sense in to their brother for you.",
            "Just point out the fault in his daughter\u2019s behavior. It should specially be done by your husband. \n\nWhen your uncle or your cousins say anything related to your husband cheating, he should say something like: \n\n\u201cI would never do something like that, it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving a mistress is really low, just as bad as being a mistress\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would I leave my family for a side piece? That\u2019s the worst thing a man can do. There\u2019s a reason they call them side piece, you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have low self esteem, why would I look for some easy woman when I have the perfect woman by my side?\u201d\n\nThat will stop the comments when they realize that it only makes his own daughter look worse.",
            ">  I can\u2019t go no contact with my uncle because my elderly grandparents live with him and he won\u2019t let me see them if I do. \n\nI would talk to my grandparents and ask them what other venues for contact might be available. Because no way in HELL would I be hanging out with this ... well what can I call him when \"man\" does not suit?",
            "Which culture/country are you from?",
            "He's trying to justify his and his daughters awful behavior.  Your husband turning down women and being a good man probably makes him insecure,  he's been justifing his actions by telling himself any man would do it,  and your husband proved that your uncle is just a disloyal, untrustworthy person.  \n\nYou can try to tell your Uncle very loudly in front of his parents that he should stop asking about your sex life because it's creepy.",
            "Your uncle wouldn't 'let' you see your grandparents? Do they not have a voice in this? No opinions? And the rest of the family would sit back and 'let' you be cut out of your grandparents' lives by a man who, obviously, has HUUUUGE problems with marital fidelity?\n\nI think you have more problems than just the awful uncle.",
            "Is there any way you can make this topic incredibly boring for your uncle? Maybe agree on a few stock phrases (NOT phrases that involve defending your marriage), and just repeat them flatly? It's called grey-rocking, and sometimes works when someone enjoys bad attention as well as good attention. If you and husband can work together, a few possible scripts. Ideally, when he starts his BS, you drop one of these and then divert attention away from him. If there are other people present, start talking to them instead. If it's just him, forcibly change the subject to the local sportsweather. \n\n\"What a strange thing to say.\" \n\"I've asked you not to bring that up.\"\n\"Wow.\" \n\"Rude.\" \n\nThe shorter, the better. And just...refuse to get involved in the back-and-forth. With gross, self-centered people, sometimes you can starve them of attention enough that they decide to find another source.",
            "Wow. You are in a horrible situation.\n\nMy first question is do your grandparents know what your uncle is saying about your husband?",
            "You recognize that his behavior isn't necessarily about his daughter, but himself? You even said his current wife was his mistress. \n\nIf he tries to say anything more defending his daughter's actions, simply tell him:\"When it comes to *your* ^^^(his) family and their views on cheating, the apple clearly didn't fall far from the tree. However, *my* ^^^(your) husband is clearly from a different orchard.\"",
            "Turn it into a big joke.  Just start asking about uncle's mistresses. Give them fake names and ask about his illegitimate kids. Ask about Tommy, the kid from the next neighbourhood who looks a lot about uncle. Keep laughing and calling it a joke. Have fun with it.",
            "It sounds like your Uncle is some variety of personality disordered abuser, he's absolutely controlling, which is abusive, and he seems to think people around him are his playthings existing for his entertainment. He's also a fully grown ass adult, and he doesn't think he's doing anything wrong, so abandon all hope of changing him.\n\nIf you have to remain in contact with him in order to access your grandparents, you and your husband need to be BORING. Look up the grey rock technique. Don't give him any narcissistic supply (I'm not here to diagnose him as narcissistic or not, the concept still applies). This includes negative reactions. Put him on an information diet. Don't get pulled into his little stories. You can say, \"okay\", and then don't talk further, or change the subject (but to something really dull and uncontroversial).\n\nIt doesn't matter to your uncle that this shit is upsetting. That should tell you everything you need to know about him. He doesn't care about you and your family as actual whole, complex individuals. You're there for his convenience (supporting his current crusade) and/or for his entertainment.\n\nDon't worry what he thinks about you. Would you go to him for his opinion on anything? I expect not, so why does his opinion of you matter? He's a shitter. Pay him no mind.\n\nI'm not saying this shouldn't hurt and your feelings don't matter but they aren't relevant in dealing with him. Feel free to vent to others who won't take what you've said back to him.",
            "Maybe your uncle wants to be his mistress. Hahahaha.",
            "How often do you see this guy?  Stop going places where he will be.  Stop interacting with him.  Block/ unfriend him on all social media.\n\nIf you do find yourself at the same gathering or event, walk away as soon as he brings up the subject.  This is ridiculous that you haven't cut him off yet.\n\nETA- just saw that he lives with your grandparents.  Does he control who they see and talk to?  I'd threaten to call Adult Protective Services on him if he refuses to let you see them simply because you will not tolerate his disgusting comments and behavior.",
            "Curious, how old is your pregnant cousin? \n\nSadly, I think that as long as your uncle is able to hold access to your grandparents over your head... you're going to have trouble. You've said that he doesn't listen to you, your husband, or anyone else. Your other family members sound just as awful - your male cousins asking your husband for the phone numbers of affair partners that he is \"bored with\" shows a shocking lack of care for you and respect for women in general. So it's unlikely that the entire family will band together to get him to stop. \n\nI would suggest that since you can't go NC, whenever he does this that you and your husband just ignore him and disengage. If he whines that you can't take a joke, ignore that comment to. Change the subject over and over. \n\n\"So, OP's husband, you'd take responsibility for a child that you fathered, right?\"\n\n\"Oh is that salsa? I haven't had some yet, could you pass the bowl?\"\n\n\"What, I'm just kidding, why aren't you joking along?\"\n\n\"I'm going to grab some tortilla chips, want anything from the kitchen?\"",
            "Time to cut your uncle out of your life.",
            "So your uncle is clearly an asshole. The question is, why don't the rest of your family recognize his bullshit for what it is? You don't just have a toxic uncle, you have a toxic family.\n\nAlso, I think you're going to have to decide if you want to see your grandparents or if you want to protect your own well being more. Unless your grandparents are seriously dependent and they want to see their granddaughter then I guess they're going to have to deal with their shitty son and tell him to knock it off. \n\nFurthermore, you don't mention your parent that is the sibling of this man. Why aren't they advocating for you? He's their stupid brother. \n\nBut I hope you don't feel like you need to throw your cousin under the bus. It's not her fault her dad is an asshole and is telling her business to the whole damn family. If I were her I'd be pretty mad he's blabbing my stuff everywhere.",
            "Stop being polite. Next time your uncle hints at it, point blank say something along the lines of:\n\n* \"Are you suggesting that after making vows to me my husband wants to f*ck other women? Are you suggesting that I am a bad overall partner, or just terrible in bed? What is it, Uncle, since you're the expert. How many women have you cheated on? You seem to be the one in the know about this. Please, don't beat around the bush, tell me, what do I need to do to make sure he doesn't leave? Should I take him upstairs and suck his c*ck right now? Would that meet with your approval, or should I just do it here in the living room where you can watch? No? Then apologize and shut the f*ck up about my marriage, you nosy pervert.\"*\n\nPoint is, your uncle is being incredibly rude, and you need to turn it around and show him how ridiculous he's being. Yell. Make a scene. Make it clear that this topic is off limits.",
            "Is this uncle the father of your cousin? Is he trying to normalize what happened in some sick way so his family doesn\u2019t become the butt of jokes by making you the next victim?",
            "Ok, first - your cousin is pregnant with a married man's baby now? But your uncle has been doing this since 2019 as per the vacation, so I don't think this can just be attributed to him projecting due to his daughter's behaviour. Sounds like he has some severe issues going on. The only thing I can think of is that your husband needs to outright tell him to stop these weird 'jokes' and start walking away when he won't drop it. he sounds like the sort of jerk who is likelier to listen to a man than a woman, to be honest.",
            "Why is your husband interacting with your uncle so much? I get you want to see your grandparents but your husband doesn\u2019t need to be a part of this. Seriously what about the parent of yours who is related to this man?  Your uncle hates his niece so much he tells everyone how funny it would be if your life was destroyed. What does everyone else genuinely think of that?",
            "You can't go no contact with your uncle, but is there any reason your SO can't? Like can't he just have plans when you go see your uncle?",
            "Hmm so your uncle cheated on his wife and married his mistress, then his daughter is the mistress of a married man. See the pattern here ? Your uncle has a narcissistic personality disorder and he kept control and validated his control with affairs, then justified them, so his daughter learned that being a mistress was the safer way to get a man, instead of being the one the man cheats on, not realizing that this is not the way morally to do things. So now he\u2019s projecting onto everyone to validate his behavior as a narcissist does. They believe everyone thinks like them, so when he can be validated in that thinking , he will stop at nothing to continue to be. So we know your uncle is messed up, however his behavior is not something you have to accept or tolerate. Narcissists like to bait you, that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing, so being caddy back may work for some but not a narcissist, he will get a thrill out of you playing the game. So only way to beat them is to disengage completely. Remove yourself from the game, the mere fact he knows he is upsetting to his why he is perpetuating it. I would set the boundary now. Stop going over there, only go over to see your grandparents, spend time with them, have convos with them, the moment he starts ignore him and his egging you on and leave immediately. Tell your husband to ignore him. The less you engage with a narc and play their game the less they get what they want from you and have to move on to their next victim. Good luck. Dealing with narcissists are hard but that\u2019s clearly what this is. He thrives off of doing this to you. He is superior and he will stop at nothing to feel that superiority (he\u2019s not superior this is how they think)",
            "First of all, Fuck this guy. Your uncle is a dipshit. You need to tell him to quit disrespecting you like this.\n\nIf anyone in my family treated me or my wife like this, I\u2019d cut them off immediately, before I ended up losing my shit, whether that person lives with my grandparents or not. Your grandparents should know he\u2019s being such a shameless scumbag, encouraging family to be shitty spouses. He obviously thinks cheating is ok, maybe for him and his wife, it is. Obviously, not for you though. Maybe he\u2019s pissed his daughter got knocked up by a married man? Maybe he feels responsible in some way that his daughter got treated the same way he treated other women? \n\nYou need to put your foot down, demand some fucking respect because, even though I don\u2019t know you, I know you fucking deserve it and you know it too.\n\nEdit: also your cousin is pregnant, I hope that baby receives all the love in the world from their mom and grandparents and extended family, no matter who the daddy is, it deserves some fucking respect too. \n\nI\u2019m kinda drunk rn btw and your story has filled me with a raging compassion. I wish the best for you, your cousin and her baby and your family, even your shitty uncle too.",

            "I'd act like the entire thing is your uncle projecting his desire to cheat on his own wife onto your husband.\n\nJust every time he brings it up, ask who he's cheating on his wife with.\n\nI mean, he's the one with the family pattern of cheating, so obviously he's the experienced expert.\n\nAsk him for some explicit advice on how to \"get away with\" cheating. How did you do it uncle?",

            "Your uncle is trying to convey to your cousin that if the guy is decent he'll get a divorce and marry her, because that's what he did. He probably keeps her hopes up on this matter with high frequency. But not just that.\nYour uncle seems to have been a chronical cheater. When he sees the attention your husband gets, he wants to live vicariously through him - and your husband isn't doing his part to keep your uncle happy, that is, he's wasting all of these awesome opportunities. Why he fixated on your husband and not some other guy? There's not enough info to make an educated guess here.\nHe's old. He lost 'it'. You can play that angle, but I suspect he's also an idiot.\nMaybe see your grandparents when he's out of the house?",
            "OP, nothing you say or do will get your uncle to stop.  He knows it's inappropriate and doesn't care.\n\nThe best thing to do would just cut all contact with him and refuse to participate.  But, if you really want to throw it back in the face, at the next family gathering, when he starts up on it again, demand to know why he didn't leave his wife for his mistress.  Keep going off at him about how his mistress' children miss their father, and how dare he stay with his wife instead of abandoning them for the other children.  Now, it would cause a shit ton of drama, but he's already started it.  \n\nThe rational solution is just go no contact though.",

Has your parent that\u2019s blood related to your uncle said anything to him? Or his own daughter for that matter? She made her own decisions, and I\u2019m not gonna pass judgment, but she should be adult enough to own her shit and know it has nothing to do with you and that her fathers actions are inappropriate.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m ruthless, but if I was in this situation everyone would be crying. You shouldn\u2019t be harassed and taking a hit cause your cousin did something uncouth and your uncles mad about the situation. It doesn\u2019t have shit to do with you and he can talk it out with his daughter and a therapist if he\u2019s so ashamed that he needs to bring you down a notch like you\u2019re familial competition.",

It sounds like the Uncle went through a phase where he had a mistress and has used every excuse in the book to justify the behavior. This may be harsh, but it sounds like your husband is not faithful, and your Uncle knows about it. Maybe he is trying to deflect some of the guilt off of himself to your husband.\n\n>my uncle has been doing his hardest to convince everyone that my cousin is the real victim in this situation.  Now, my uncle is obsessed with the idea of my husband having a mistress. \n\n* If nothing is going on with another woman, why on earth would your Uncle be focused on directing this obsession towards your husband? Does he do this with other male members of the family?\n\n>There was this one particular girl though, that brazenly invited my husband to her room in front of my uncles/cousins.

            "Your response so far has been to let your uncle know this is bothering you, which will not change his behavior - your uncle is doing this BECAUSE he knows it bothers you. He started making these \"jokes\" after you exploded at him and his daughter cried. It's likely that he, upset at you for this, wants you to feel the same abandonment or insecurity she likely feels. Whatever you feel about the situation or their moral compasses, he is pulling out all the stops on this because he doesn't want to see his daughter hurt any more than she already is and can't think of a better way to get back at you. Obviously, your cousin's choices and the married man share a lot more of the blame for how things shook out, but people often latch onto another scapegoat when they can't direct their anger at a more appropriate source, for whatever reason. \n\nMy guess is you can make him stop by approaching him and saying something to the tune of \"I've thought about it and couldn't understand why you wouldn't drop this whole mistress thing with my husband. But I realized you must be making these jokes because you are still upset about \\[what I said that day your daughter cried, your daughter's situation, whatever\\]. I know you love her and don't want her to hurt. If you ever want to talk about it I'm here.\" \n\nI don't think this will result in a magic family reunion, but if it's on the money he's likely to feel embarrassed and drop it, simply because he doesn't want to talk about it again, or for it to be about his own vulnerability rather than yours. If he keeps making the jokes, you can keep taking it back to his feelings, which are clearly an uncomfortable topic, as he's launched on a passive aggressive \"joke\" campaign rather than settle it. Either he will choose to open up to you about it or he will knock it off (more likely the latter). \n\nJust my two cents.",
            "Either he\u2019s intentionally trying to annoy you which is working or there is some validity to his statement. If your husband isn\u2019t aggressive with him and is just like hey that\u2019s inappropriate only I would question if he was cheating too.

He needs to be told by your husband that unlike other people, he thinks marriage is sacred & very respectable & people who who have mistresses are shitty people. He can then invent someone he knows who's cheating on their wives & your husband can tell him that he thinks that the woman is a trashy woman to hang out with a married man & he hopes  he never marries her because if she slept with a married man, God knows how many men shes sleeping with etc. That might really shut him up but he won't be able to say anything cos he wouldn't have been directly attacked. \nI put my uncle in his place a couple of years ago with a lot of respect & then he felt bad & apologised. He's never apologised to anyone before. Sometimes they need to just be shown the reality in the face. No one speaks up to these kind of people so they go overboard.

There have been times this past week where I've found myself getting irritated or upset for no good reason so I took a few redditors' advice and I've started taking notes on my phone of what I'm feeling. It has helped me stay calm when I'm expressing my thoughts and emotions. I know I have a long road ahead of me and I'm so thankful for everyone's advice.",

            "First off I think it's awesome that you're recognizing unhealthy behaviors and are taking responsibility for them. Don't be too hard on yourself though, just because you make some mistakes and go through challenges doesn't mean you're a terrible partner. It just means you have learning to do. You never learned these things as a child, due to your upbringing, so you have to learn them now. Most adults have something that they are now dealing with from childhood. \n\nI make mistakes all the time in my relationship too and I can often get very hard on myself and think I'm just a terrible partner and why is he even with me. I know that's something I need to work on. I've been reading a lot of self-help books to try to learn how to make the right changes. I just read something today that I feel like can help a lot of people in a lot of different situations.\n\nIt's recognizing the fact that humans are natural story-tellers. We create stories to help make sense of things that don't make sense. We do this in relationships too and you need to recognize when you do this. For example, ask yourself why you were mad at your boyfriend for being late? Perhaps you thought that he wasn't thinking about you, that he'd rather be with his friends. That right there is a story. You don't know if that's really true, but in you're head you think it is. Ask yourself how that makes your feel? It makes you feel inadequate and insecure about your place in his life(just examples, I don't know your real feelings of course). Then ask how you cope with those feelings? You pick fights with him to feel like you have the upperhand, or to feel right about something in the relationship. Once you start realizing why you feel or do the things you do and where they're coming from then it will hopefully be easier to stop those emotions from taking control of you. I feel like the hard part is catching them before you do the coping strategy which makes things worse. But do the best you can and hopefully you'll get there. And in the future when you recognize that you're starting to tell yourself a story about something, you can stop and ask him why instead of making it up yourself.",
            "What an awesome update!! I'm happy to hear that things are progressing towards you being a happy, healthy, well-adjusted individual.",
            "I feel like I\u2019m in the same road as you right now with not only my SO but also my friends and family, trying to handle better my emotions, my expectations and my on-and-off anxiety feelings. It\u2019s very difficult and sometimes I feel like it\u2019d be better for everyone that I went to live on my own up the mountains, but it\u2019s so rewarding when I\u2019m able to show my emotions in a healthy way and I see how my partner and loved ones react to that. \n\nTherapy really (really!!) helps but in the end it\u2019s a day to day responsibility that we have to take. Our loved ones are not responsible for our dysfunctions, although their support is actually essential, so don\u2019t be scared to ask for help. That\u2019s not a sign of weakness, something that I\u2019ve learnt a bit late (but better late than never!).\n\nKeep up the good work! I\u2019m sure you can do this!",
            "I have struggled with this a lot before! Some things I've done:\n\nI also write down my feelings before bringing them up if they seem silly at all. So by the time I've calmed down from my emotions, I usually realize my reaction was silly and dont even feel the need to bring it up.\n\nI have recognized that it is okay to have my bad feelings and to share them, but I make it clear that I'm not necessarily mad AT him. Like for example, I get easily upset if plans change. So I will be upset about it and share my feelings with my bf, but I'll let him know I'm not really mad at him, I'm just mad at the situation (even if it was partly his fault, it's usually not a big deal). \n\nLastly, I've found that a lot of my bad feelings come from insecurities about the relationship and how he feels about me. Working on these helps the bad reactions be less intense and less often. \n\nHope it helps!!",
            "Great job with your progress, and recognizing it was something you needed to work on! \n\nTherapy also helped me with learning to express emotions. I've learned that, for me, I do sometimes overreact. Before I approach my SO with what I'm feeling, I take a little while to really think through what I'm having an issue with. Was it what he said, or was it because something innocent he said reminded me of one of my own insecurities, that he didn't help create and cannot fix for me? Or was it truly something that hurt me, and if so, was it just the way he worded it (he and I don't think or communicate thoughts the same way)?\n\nI have told him I need that time to think through what I'm feeling so I don't react in a way I'll regret, and also so I can be clear in expressing myself. He's learned that if something is wrong, I will say \"I'm a little upset, but I need some time to think about how to say it. We're fine, but we can talk about it later.\" And he's been so patient. I always do talk about it later (later can be 30 minutes later, or after we finish dinner, or before we go to bed hours later, but it always gets resolved). \n\nSometimes those conversations are \"When you said x, I just heard x+y. After thinking about it, I know that's not what you meant, but this is what it made me think about and I just felt crappy for a while.\" Or it may be \"When this happened, it really made me feel like A.\" \n\nYou are going to feel so STRONG and confident with yourself when you're able to evaluate your emotions and thoughts, control your reaction, and effectively communicate. \n\nBest of luck to you!! You're on the right path!",

        "selftext": "This is an odd one. I've been with her for 3.5 years, though most of it long distance, so our time together was limited to a couple months each year. Recently she finished school and moved across the country to be with me, before she did I expressed my concerns that I didn't want to be the reason she'd move and that I can't promise we'd end up together. She moved anyways, we've been living together for about 6 months. Things have been going alright, but lurking problems with our sex life have come to the fore.\n\nShe has a health condition which limits her ability to move her hips and limits sensation - that's as specific as I'll get. Otherwise she's very active and lives a normal life. I'm her first sexual partner, but she is not my first. Sexual contact and quality time are how I best \"hear\" the affection of a partner, I've always been a sexual person. She is not asexual, but due to her condition she simply doesn't enjoy sex and never has - best case she has minimal sensation and worst case she starts to hurt. She isn't vocal, can almost never finish (even on her own alone-time, due to a lack of sensation), and doesn't see sex (or being physically intimate) as a big part of a relationship - I always have. I always have to initiate, and while she will reciprocate it almost always feels somewhat forced on her part, like a chore, which leaves me feeling utterly terrible. I've communicated my concern about our sexual incompatibility, several times over the past 3.5 years, and she's always said she will try. My problem is that I'm not sure there's anything to \"try\". I don't want her to have to \"try\". I've tried to get her to open up, to relax and accept herself and be more sexually free, but when there isn't sensation it's just a nonstarter for her, which also means she almost never initiates anything and there's never any romantic interactions outside of the of when we're intimate - it's not how she thinks.\n\nMy mind has begun to wander. I remember previous sexual partners and I miss feeling physically wanted and satisfied, I miss having an actively participating partner. I miss the feeling of being able to satisfy my parter, and the intimacy that a good sex life brings into a relationship. I cheated on a partner of mine in the past, immediately came forward with it, and felt terrible - I swore on my life I'd never do that again to someone I love. I'm going to seek professional help but the waitlist for therapy at my University is at least a month, and frankly the therapist is terrible. I'm stuck in a shitty cycle of 1) feeling like I deserve a sexually compatible partner, 2) degrading myself for labeling my girlfriend (in my head) as sexually incompatible with me despite all her efforts and her condition, 3) reconciling with the fact that she has a medical condition and doesn't really have any control over the situation, and 4) trying to understand how to make things work or if that's even an option.\n\nShe is a possessive, so extra partners is not an option - and frankly not what I want. I want intimacy with my partner. Her mind has always been on marriage, but I don't see how any marriage can work without intimacy and satisfaction for both partners. What can I do when we've already talked this out and tried to address it for years long-distance, and now months of living together? Do I just squash the part of myself that wants to give and receive intimacy? Am I wrong for thinking that is a requirement of a healthy relationship? Are there other things we can do? I feel like she has no choice due to her condition. I refuse to cheat. The idea of leaving her for something that appears so shallow, when we have an otherwise good relationship, ruins me and will ruin her.\n\nThanks for the help...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR! Girlfriend has a health condition that makes it so she can't really move her hips and doesn't feel much sexually - and her personality understandably does not weigh prioritize physical intimacy. I am very physical and always have to initiate intimacy - 3.5 years on it feels like I am a sexual chore to her - though she will never admit to it. We've always talked openly about trying to fix this, but nothing has worked. I miss the feeling of intimacy that comes with a compatible sexual partner and it's making me doubt an otherwise solid relationship.   \n\n\nEdit: Just nipping any comments now in the bud that suggest trying to spice things up in the bedroom. We've tried everything you can think of. The reality is that when your partner doesn't feel sexual pleasure that doesn't give you much to work off of. Open to creative suggestions, but just putting that out there.",

I wouldn\u2019t stay in that relationship either. \n\nHowever, if you did want to try to make it work, you could try helping her find sexual pleasure outside of sex. It sounds like her condition affects her pelvic area but not necessarily other sensitive areas such as breasts, neck, shoulders, etc. You say you\u2019ve tried spicing it up, but I\u2019m not sure what all that entails. It sounds like you\u2019ve focused on penetrative sex specifically which isn\u2019t going to be helpful, no matter the amount of spice, if that\u2019s not what feels good for your partner. \n\nBut again, this isn\u2019t something you\u2019re obligated to keep trying.

            "Sorry but as a SCI sufferer (spinal injury) I'm fully aware that if one erogenous zone doesn't work well, others compensate, or can be made to. If she has a low libido AND doesn't want to investigate how to be a more sexually excited person with you, that's one thing, but how much time have you spent trying to turn her on stimulating her inner thighs, outer thighs, toes, feet, fingers, breast tissue, neck, earlobes, belly, clavicle etc? If your desired end point is penetrative sex every time, you're gonna have a relationship fail. If it's 'I'd like to help us feel close to each other in a sensuous way, lets relax with a bubble bath, candles and massage and you can tell me what feels good *without* the pressure of penetration, and you can legitimately call yourself happy to take that as a starting point and maybe a finishing point, you might stand a chance of saving the relationship.\n\nBut it'll take a LOT of time to change her lack of enjoyment of sex, and it won't change through anything that makes it feel like pressure - even this. If you have a commitment to her pleasure in life and she doesn't have a commitment to yours however you may be better split up - a devoted couple puts each others needs first, and desires good things for their partner, and will make sacrifices they're okay with to achieve their partners happiness. If she's truly lacking all sensation possiblity, you do have a struggle though, as you say.",

            "This is a dealbreaker, right? \n\nIt's an unfortunate one... No one here is really in the wrong or the bad guy. It just isn't working. \n\nIn all honesty I feel like this was something that should've been discussed prior to her moving to your area to start this relationship.

            "You've got to either accept her as she is or accept you're not compatible and move on. Trying to change her and make her more sexual isn't ever going to work because of her condition. The fact is it IS a chore for her because she gets nothing out of it. She doesn't get to enjoy it. She doesn't get to orgasm, which means she doesn't get the hormonal release from the orgasm that is responsible for the feelings of intimacy after making love, which means she doesn't understand how it increases intimacy. So it really is just a chore for her, and apparently one she's not crazy about doing often. So you've either got to accept her as she is or move on. And as unhappy as you are, I'd say move on and find someone who can meet all your needs.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like she would be better off with someone of very very low sex drive or asexual as well, because then she wouldn't be required to perform this chore and she wouldn't be stuck knowing she's making her SO miserable.",

There are so many ways to create intimate moments with someone without full on having sex.\n\nI fully understand how conflicted you are, but this is not a situation in which you are wrongfully categorizing you both as being sexually incompatible. That's exactly what's going on here. She doesnt desire or need sex and you do. You are not having your needs met.\n\nNow, two things can happen with this: you both can sit down and discuss your needs and how you both as a couple can come to a happy middle ground with it wherein you feel valued, loved, desired, ect..and she doesnt feel pushed or pressured or like it's a chore. Or you go your separate ways and seek a partner you're both more compatible with.\n\nDoes she not enjoy kissing you or touching you in ways that are not sexual? Does she not enjoy being kissed and touched, even if it's not down there? Is she open to participating in sexual encounters that allow you to feel satisfied and connected with her that dont entail PIV? \n\nYou both are quite young, she has to be reasonable about this. If she doesn't want you to have your sexual needs met by other women, then she needs to come to the table and work on a solution to this issue. Otherwise, the relationship doesnt have a future. This is not an issue that would get better over time with the level of effort that's currently going into this issue.",
            "I agree with people who say that there are other erogenous zones to explore. A lot mentally can go into being in a place where you want to be physically intimate. Speaking as a woman who had always thought I had a low sex drive and couldn\u2019t have an orgasm until recently, a lot of being turned on is mental for me. After exploring this stuff I can now have an orgasm with a conversation (the right conversation) and minimal touching at the end. I can have one by holding myself over someone and them refusing to touch me. This is something you have to work on together (if you want to continue the relationship - and yeah, this seems like a necessity for you to be happy in a relationship). Even if she doesn\u2019t fantasize, masturbate or anything, even if she\u2019s tried to turn herself on and doesn\u2019t really know how, that does not mean she doesn\u2019t have turn-ons. Maybe she hasn\u2019t found the right fantasies. Maybe she doesn\u2019t think of sex because she doesn\u2019t think of herself as sexual. Maybe you only go for her clitoris. I don\u2019t know what her mental situation is or what your sex has looked like, but I believe there\u2019s always more to try. I think that you can start by talking about sex in a different way than you have. I don\u2019t know what your conversations have been like and maybe you\u2019ve tried this many times, but make sure your conversations about sex are not just about the problems and how important it is to you. Make them fun and be curious. Ask questions about what she thinks is hot in movies, or talk about what your teenage fantasies were like, or ask about when she finds herself attracted to strangers. There are many places to start. Obviously a sex therapist would be a great way to explore this but it sounds like you don\u2019t really have that option. One way I\u2019ve learned about my own sexuality is by listening to Esther Perel\u2019s podcast where should we begin. She\u2019s a sex therapist who recorded counseling sessions with couples, and a lot of them are about sexual dysfunction or one partner or both being unsatisfied. Not all of them would be relevant to you but some episodes definitely would. One thing she says that I like is that the idea that we don\u2019t have to try during sex and that it should just come natural is a myth that discredits the art and work that sex is. Another thing I want to add is that nothing is less sexy than the idea that you have to get into it or your partner is going to leave. Always approach this gently but also directly. Lastly, if you try and try and it\u2019s not working, forgive yourself for leaving. You\u2019re allowed to care about what you care about, it\u2019s not shallow.\n\nEdit: It\u2019s possible that you just want different things from a relationship and that she actually doesn\u2019t want to have sex, but given the fact that she responds that she\u2019ll try I don\u2019t think this is it. She wants to try because she wants to be with you, and sex is a piece of that for you, which she knows. But she can\u2019t just will herself to desire. You have to try new things together. I\u2019m frustrated though by how many people are responding \u201cyou\u2019re just incompatible\u201d. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily true, and if it is true I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve explored the right means to find out for sure.",
            "Honestly ignoring the sex aspect here I find it odd that after so long together being long distance you still didn't want her to move to be with you. That tends to be the natural path for people long distance, especially after three years...",

If you aren\u2019t sure about someone then don\u2019t date them. You just wasted years of your life on her, and you wasted her time too. (She also might have wasted her own time and yours.) \n\nDo both of you a favor and get out. It\u2019s kind of embarrassing that you\u2019re both still together when it\u2019s quite obvious you\u2019ve never been compatible. \n\nAnd then maybe talk to a therapist to figure out why you were willing to settle for someone so not right for you for so long.

            "Probably going to get downvotes for this but I really dont care. Everyone is saying leave, if you are invested in this relationship and see great value outside of sex in it then I'd say stay and work on the issue at hand.\n\nDo you expect your GF to enjoy sex when its something that she physically cannot enjoy due to a health condition? Of course she doesnt place much value on the physical intimacy in the relationship because for her she knows she is lacking, again due to a health condition. Personally if I was in her shoes. I would drive myself to depression if I constantly worried about the physical intimacy and how I could enjoy my partner in bed without the limitations caused by my sickness. So she finds other areas in your relationship to place value on, maybe she values your heart and you as a person more than sex or anything else.\n\nI'm not saying that you should sacrifice as a result of this, but give her a little grace because from your post it seems kind of harsh in what you expect of her, and honestly would destroy me as a woman if I were in her shoes. I'd suggest maybe having her see a therapist or talking to her dr about ways she can perform sexually without as many limitations, but I'd also say you should really meet her in the middle.

It's the need to feel desired and wanted, and to feel physically close to your partner. Intimacy is hugely important in most relationships.. it's part of what separates a relationship from that of a friendship. \n\nYour relationship otherwise sounds great, but the reason it isn't working and cannot work is because one of the foundation blocks are missing, and will likely always be missing. The longer you stay, the more the resentment will build, and the more guilt you will feel for feeling that way.. which will create a spiral where you feel more resentment for having to feel guilty for a normal human desire. Therapy won't make you desire intimacy any less, and it won't change her condition. \n\nMost importantly **YOU'RE NOT A BAD PERSON FOR FEELING THE WAY YOU DO**. \n\nYou've **both** put in a lot of effort to try and make this work, so you won't be walking away without having given it a solid chance.

Work through your own feelings about sex and try to understand her pain in all this.\n\nEdit: just want to add that I now enjoy having sex again after working through my dysfunction for almost two years. My Boyfriend has stuck with me and learned to not pressure me into having sex. That emotional support made me feel open and comfortable to having sex again and enjoying it!",

Yes. Lots of people have healthy relationships without sex.\n\nAm I wrong for thinking that's a requirement for me having a healthy relationship? No. Because you get to define what your own requirements and dealbreakers are. And you've done that admirably - you've defined one of your requirements not just as sex, but mutually enjoyable consensual sex. \n\nI'm wondering if you'd be more okay breaking up with someone who was asexual but otherwise healthy.

Nothing wrong with it per se, but she should look for someone with the same views and not just dismiss your concerns. However, it may be hard for her to believe you value sex as much as you claim when you've spent 3 years in a LDR with someone who cannot have sex neither enjoys it, and on top you moved in together. Just try to think of this, but bottom line is that this is a very valid reason to break up",

Be strong, honest with yourself and your SO and good luck.",
            "This sucks. I hate this for you and her. Honestly, it just sounds like you're incompatible sexually, and you have to decide for yourself if that's something that you can live with. Ask yourself, \"If this never changes (because it very likely won't), can I be happy for the rest of my life like this? Will I start to resent her? Will it start to weigh on me emotionally? Will it start to chip away at my self-esteem or overall life satisfaction?\" You need to really grapple with the long-term implications of this, because if it's a problem now, it will be a problem next year, five years from now, ten years from now. And 3.5 yrs isn't nothing, but a decade, two decades, three...is a lot more. And problems tend to grow larger and more corrosive the longer they continue.\n\nPersonally, I could not be with a partner who wasn't as sexual as I am and didn't want me as much as I want them sexually. It would start to erode my sense of desirability and self-worth. It would be very damaging for me emotionally, and I would either get to an unhealthy place psychologically or just straight up start resenting my partner. Both of those results would be toxic for the relationship. So, considering what it would do to me, I can only tell you what I would do if I were you: Figure out what you can live with and talk to her about it. It's not her fault that she doesn't enjoy sex, and honestly, there's nothing wrong with that. Lots of people don't, but they aren't all partnered with someone who really wants and needs sexual intimacy. Be open with her. Be honest with yourself. And don't anchor yourself or her to a relationship that might eventually turn toxic or resentful.",

Otherwise we can make our other sensitive body parts to become a new focal point. I for one have achieved an orgasm just by performing oral on my wife. If she has already given up on sexual pleasure it will be very difficult to engage her. \n\nIt's not going to be easy but both of you finding more compatible partners seems to be the only choice with potential for happiness for both of you.",

There is NOTHING wrong with breaking up because of a lack of sexual intimacy. It's not her fault she has this issue, but you're a person with wants and needs that she can't fulfill, and doesn't HAVE to fulfill. But because of those things that just means you shouldn't stay together because you have different desires and expectations.  \n\nDon't keep yourself in a relationship just because she moved for you.

You do. \n2. The two of you are sexually incompatible. That's just a fact. It's not a judgement on either of you, people have different sex drives, it's very normal. \n3. You also have no control over having a higher libido, just as someone with a lower libido can't really control it. It's not her fault she cannot feel sexual pleasure, but it's also not your fault that you can and that it's an important connection for you with your partner. \n4. It's possible to make relationships work across different sex drives but it's very challenging to navigate and doesn't work for lots of couples. Besides, it sounds like you guys have tried to work it out and it hasn't been working for you. While an active sexual life isn't important to everyone, all that matters is that it's an important part of a relationship for you. Again, none of this is a value judgement on you or your girlfriend, there's no right or wrong answer to this. \n\nLeaving a relationship because you are incompatible sexually is not shallow. It's hard, because you love her and there's nothing either of you have done \"wrong\". You're simply not compatible sexually and the things you have tried to fix this issue have not been a fix for you.  \n\n\nWill breaking up be painful? Absolutely it will.

It's better to break up on amicable terms than it is to wait until you feel resentful because your needs haven't been met.

That sub can be incredibly helpful and supportive.

When you're no longer sexually active with someone or it's becoming humiliating, degrading and aggravating to always initiate sex, you only need one more nail in the coffin.

I just don\u2019t really know why I\u2019m not that into sex/intimacy.\n\nIf it\u2019s any help, I think the reason I\u2019m not good at initiating is that I don\u2019t see sex as something very \u201crewarding\u201d if you understand? Yeah it\u2019s nice, but it\u2019s not a big pleasure thing as it\u2019s for most guys. And knowing my partner only wants what\u2019s best for me during sex, adds more pressure on me as I don\u2019t want him to feel bad for not being able to do anything. Which also makes sex a bit more stressful and not as relaxing as it should.\n\nIf your gf haven\u2019t experienced much pleasure, she doesn\u2019t really know what she\u2019s missing right? So sex could be like reading a book, interesting, but not really that exciting. She also probably struggles a bit with intimacy, but there\u2019s hope!\n\nI would personally give her a chance.

Your ideal seems to be someone who can totally meet YOUR needs, and measure up to YOUR level. I wonder what neds of your girlfriends you aren't meeting?

            "If you want to make it work, I think couples counseling is a good idea. Her physical limitations aren't the end of the world - as other have pointed out, there is more to a sex like then penetrative sex or even orgasm. And it sounds, to me, that sex the be all and end all of what you're after anyway. How would it make you feel to give your partner a message, and see her really relax and enjoy it? How much would it mean to you if your partner sat in your lap and played with you hair while you watched TV? It seems like touch is an important part of love for you, and she just doesn't get that, or maybe you aren't explaining it well. You need physical intimacy to help sustain the feeling of love, and that's perfectly normal. I think in order to work, you as a couple would need help understanding that there is more to touch than sex. I think that's become a huge blocker for her. If she could touch you every day, and you could figure out pleasurable physical things to do together besides sex (message, dance, whatever), and you could find ways to sometimes enjoy sexual contact even if it isn't PIV sex then I think things could work out. But first you need that shared vision and mutual understanding of each other's needs - counseling can help.",
            "I dated a girl who had vaginismus for a while and while I truly loved her and cared for her I could never truly be happy in our intimacy. I think a lot of the time we feel bad about placing importance on being sexually active with our partners because it feels shallow and petty to have to leave someone you love because of a lack of sexual satisfaction or involvement. But when you are expected to be monogamous and find all gratification from that one person it's kind of hard to be also expected to stay in that relationship when your needs can't be met. I understand it feels shitty to want/have to leave someone for this reason but it is important for your own self esteem and mental health that you be with someone who matches your sexual needs as much as your other needs. If they are unwilling to let you find gratification in other people while also showing little to no interest in meeting your needs themselves, it may be time to move on.",

            "I'm an asexual person. I've been sex-repulsed before and I'm sex-indifferent now, but still leaning a little on the \"ew sex\" side. I see sex as an equivalent of having to dig out my dirty socks and putting them in the laundry. I see it as somewhat necessary for relationships in this day and age, but I still see it as gross, and I can never feel excited to pick up my dirty socks. I mean, who would ever feel excited and tingling with anticipation over doing the laundry? At best, my analogy can be about getting excited over waiting for the paint to dry so you can put on a new coat.\n\nThat being said, I think your gf has really been trying her hardest to be excited at doing something mundane and unexciting for her. This is something she sees as necessary for this relationship to flourish, and she is trying her best to be accepting of it. How? She is going through with sex when you ask for it. You've already said that the medication is making her even less interested in sex than expected. Of course she isn't going to initiate: it literally does not cross her mind. When would laundry come up in my mind? Maybe when I smell it or see it, but I don't just randomly think of how exciting doing laundry is when I get home from a long work day. \n\nYou can leave for any reason, and it sounds like she really has tried her best. You have also tried, and it just looks like you're both incompatible. If you truly cannot see yourself without sex (and this is perfectly valid, to each their own), then just state that you two have different outlooks on relationships and leave it at that. \n\nMoreover, physical intimacy (or I guess, \"intimacy\" in general) is not *just* sex. Cuddling, small kisses here and there, hugs, sitting on someone's lap, touching their face/ears/neck, and even just physically being close are also types of physical intimacy that don't involve sex. Would this type of physical intimacy make up for it? \n\nIf not, or she's not initiating any other types of intimacy, then there's nothing left to salvage.",

Honestly I\u2019ve been trying to break up with him for the last five years or so because I don\u2019t see anything ever changing and it\u2019s constantly an argument that causes him serious depression and self esteem issues.

It's normal for people in relationships to prioritize sex less and less when they are fulfilled in other ways in the relationship. But if this is something you absolutely need from a long-term partner until you die, you need to figure out what you're ok with. If she could satisfy 50% of that need, would that be ok? 70%? \n\nI've never associated sex with any sort of emotional gain or connection. It's just sex. I don't have sex with anyone other than with who I'm exclusively dating, but I also don't get emotional satisfaction from it. Everyone's different.

            "Look man I've been through this myself. The long distance stuff, then move in with them for a while, and even she had a lot of possessiveness you off handily mentioned. What Im saying is I have been there and the honest answer is that your going to have to break up.  There is NOTHING your going to do to change her.  This is her and she is not going to change.  And since this sexless status quo does not work for you it is best that you split now.\n\n  My ex Gf had a sexual problem that made her not want to enjoy sex. It would physically harm her so she never wanted to have sex.  Which I get as if I was being physically harmed by something I would not want to do it either.  Although, this meant that she would hardly initiate and when I tried to indicate, she would either say she is too busy/some type of excuse or worse, go along with it and clearly not be enjoying it.  Which obviously I tried to stop but then she would get indigent that we must finish if she going  to endure this much pain.   So yea this would fuck my mind up like every time as I seriously started to think that I was raping her all the time.\n\nI tried everything to make her more comfortable with sex or find ways to enjoy it and everything did not work.  So between my already fucked up mindset I started to think about cheating.  It was something that I was morally against (still am) but to be in a situation where your partner never wants sex at all...your mind just keeps wondering. Which was all very unhealthy.   So between this and some other problems I decided to break up with her as I did not want to eventually go down that path of cheating or stay in a sexless relationship.  Which hurt a lot but it was ultimately for the best.\n\nI should say this doesn't make her a terrible person it just means that she is not sexual person and never will be.  You trying to change her will only make her more mad. Which hurts as you are a sexual person and as this post demonstrates you cannot live without it.  That means your either going to resent her heavily for this or if you stay with her end up cheating on her.  Both things I have a feeling you would not want to do.  So I am saying that it sucks but its time to rip the bandaid off and end it.",

            "This isn't something she can help. She is able to show you affection in other ways. There are more ways than actual penetrative sex for you to get off and she's clearly willing to continue trying to sleep with you even though she medically is unable to feel anything. It sounds as if she wants to make you happy and she would be open to options if you gave them to her. It's not that she doesn't want you. It's that she is physically unable to feel the sensation you give her. Sensation, stimulation is the entire cause of orgasm. So it's impossible for her to get to that state and it's not because of you.  If you want to be with her, don't pressure her into doing something she doesn't enjoy or that she gets nothing from.  She does seem to care about you.  Her feelings of sex not being a big deal in a relationship may be because she has never been able to feel what it's like,  not that she doesn't give a shit about you.  It most likely is that she doesn't know what it feels like from limited sensation.",

            "Hey OP! Before you decide if you're sexually incompatible wit your girl, see if she can be a sexual partner first! No *sexual satisfaction/pleasure on her end needed* Substitute all mentions of her getting hot for mental stimulation/providing romantic affection.  Because, how you describe your sexlife, you've been partner-less. No worries it's sucks. What sucks even more is that this is probably all in your hands. Harsh reality. But, and what I'm about to suggest is definitely manipulative(benignly so IMO), you need to try draw out her sexuality. Other commenters are going to say blah blah communicate your needs, talk your way into a compromise, decide if this is something you can handle, is this a DEALBREAKER. Fuck all that. You don't want to be patronized to any further. You want to know if this girl can be your sexual partner, and words carry with them lies. And you're going to draw that shit out of her, if it's there. You've invested years into this thing and you're owed the truth(oh what about the sunk cost fallacy, maybe you guys are incompatible, just break up the unhelpful fools will cry) So, before I give the how, I want to preface this with how much time, effort, and pain this is going to cost. A lot lol. Three things are needed. You are to remain hopeful+enthusiastic(positive reinforcement), CONSISTENT, and finally, most importantly SHUT THE FUCK UP about it. Your intentions cannot be known. I cannot stress that enough. You've been truthful in what you want/need and she used that shit against you. Fuck her. This is your sexy revenge. So anyhow you are probably not going to be able to delve into a traditional sex life with her cause of her whatever lol. I think most of all, your craving intimacy. She can give that to you, no vagina involved. But she probably won't, no matter what, at least not right away, or anytime soon. Doesn't matter right now and if she does, encourage it through your actions, because it's probably a fucking lie, and the only way it won't be a lie, is if her enthusiasm is consistent over a period of time. Sorry for being verbose but I felt the need to mention some of the pitfalls in this type of journey. So onto the actual method. I'll give two examples. Btw this can work with any sexual activity with some brainstorming and modification. You lack an intimate partner. So put this Lady in a role where being an intimate partner is a requirement. Something niche and pretty esoteric is ideal because she doesn't need to be able to know wtf is going on, only guess at it, and super fucking turned on by it(without realizing it ideally). For instance, say you like the idea of lactation play(other posters r going to be like but what if she's not into that or grossed out by it you need to communicateeeee. Stfu he tried that. If that's the case, after a few weeks of trying to it her hot for it, and it's not working, move onto the next thing ad infinitum until your sure this Lady is a lying asexual or otherwise who can't fulfill your needs. Keep in mind this can also be a journey of self discovery of new fun shit you can bring into your next relationship so all is not lost of this doesn't work out). So you're super turned on by the thought of nursing at your girls lactating titties. Awesomeeee. RESEARCH AND KNOW EVERY NUANCE ABOUT IT.  But how do you make her, because this needs to be all about her role in your sexual partnership, put in the effort for this(bare minimum. Ideal is she finds it fucking hot)?? Ezzzzz. Through the power of soft MANIPULATION. Aka baiting the Lady. How this is done is through your masturbation. You are suddenly IN LOVE with your girls titties. That's all you fucking need. Slow escalation is the secret baby. She can't realize the change immediately. This is a transitional period. Take it slow. I'll tell you why. Because right now YOU made HER feel fucking powerless in your sexual relationship dynamic. Fix that. You NEED to give her the POWER(eventually she needs to TAKE it). Slowly at first. What she does with it will tell you all you need to know. Back to your masturbation. So to start(feel like I'm repeating myself lolo) ease off her with your sexual needs and start taking care of yourself more. She might panic, she might be relieved, she might not notice. W/E. THE SLOW ESCALATION OF HER INVOLVEMENT IS KEY. First, make out with her. Let your hands roam her bodies, ending up on her titties. Take off her shirt only. Forget about her lower body, her vagina is her source of powerlessness. Keep making out. Hopefully she likes that. Fuck her if not you don't care. Youre self-consummating right now. Your penis doesn't need to be out for this. Keep it sensual. For yourself bro. You don't give a flying fuck about what's going on with her as you're doing this. And you're not going to say a fucking word about it if she asks. This is a mystery for HER to figure out. After the shirts off play involve her titties a lil more. Suck on them, knead them, w/e(all hypothetical to show the method is correct escalation n whatnot). But you need to invoke other things to throw her off the scent. At least in the beginning. Get really fucking hot and hyped doing this. Passionate. Then, at an apex like you just orgasmed AMAZINGLY in your pants, stop, look her in the eyes, like you just achieved this together, say something dumbly meaningful like \"you're so fucking hot I love you\", leave her dazed and confused, SEPARATE PHYSICALLY, like locking yourself in the bathroom, masturbate, and cum loudly. The best IMO is so that she vaguely understands you went off to masturbate, but not hyper aware of it. You don't want to bring her insecurities out. FUCKING BOOM. You just made her your ignorant Lover. Part 2 incoming.",

I'd almost put it as high as 20-25% in terms of importance.  Why put up with a woman in your home if you both are not going to be intimate together?       It would be hard to stay with a partner (gender is irrelevant)  who was not into sex.  This said, I love my wife, and everything about her but if the sex were to suddenly stop and she would not let me branch out if she was unable to perform I'm sure we would have issues,  I do not want to say i'd go so far as cheating but I'd certainly approach her about maybe an avenue to which a sex partner can be brought into the relationship for sex only.  \n\n\nAs it is now we have days in which we have great intimate sex, days which she wants me to go down on her etc.    Other days its more about me and my needs and she understands that.    \n\n\nI could not imagine a relationship that was sexless, i would end it.",

I realized that my husband and his BIL were underplaying my SIL's behavior. Cutting someone's hair while they sleep may be understandable if you are a toddler who does not understand, but from a 38 year old woman???\n\n\nAnyways, I spoke to my husband and told him that I was deeply hurt that he did not defend me and instead defended his sister. To me, it was not getting hair cut off, but it was the intention behind her action (being spiteful). I let him know that I refuse to ever see her again. He started calling me dramatic and saying things like \"Lucy has always been this way since she was a kid. She's just like that, don't let it get to you.\" I was floored with his response and told him that he is continuing to defend her by saying that. He then got angry and said that I don't understand where he is coming from and that I have an \"outsider's\" point of view. I felt very hurt and disgusted by what I was hearing. To him it was just \"hair and it will grow back\" but to me it was \"SIL attacked me with scissors while I was sleeping\".\n\n\nI told him I needed some time to process things, as I cannot be married to someone who does not have my back. I took a few days to reflect on my last year of marriage and there were many instances where my husband has thrown me under the bus when dealing with his family. He always supports his family and makes me out to be the criminal, the \"overdramatic\" one. \n\n\n\nAt this current moment in time we have separated. My husband does not understand and said to me the other day \"now you are acting like Lucy!\" which I was astounded by. I am very certain that I will be filing for divorce.\n\n\n**TL;DR: SIL cut my hair, ended up cutting ties with my husband.**",

Because, yes, you **do** have an outsider's view, unblunted by an entire lifetime of unconditional love.

It can be just about that, you don't have to qualify it with \"well it's not what she did, but why she did it.\"  What she did was shitty enough to never want to see her again.

            "Your husband is right in one thing - you do have an \"outsider's\" point of view. It is likely that, for whatever reason, Lucy's bad behaviour has been accepted and glossed over by his family for decades. They may not like what she does but they have come to accept it. Maybe they have learned that if Lucy's behaviour is challenged then she goes completely postal and they're frightened of provoking her. Maybe there's something else going on that makes the reason for Lucy's behaviour something of a family secret. Maybe she has mental health issues. Maybe she was babied and coddled and never properly disciplined for some reason (I've seen this when the person was very ill as a young child and then, forever more, they were treated with kid gloves and never had to face any consequences for their actions and so grew up to be a complete brat). You may never know.\n\nNow along comes you. You get assaulted by her and you, quite rightly, complain and complain loudly. From the family's point of view, though, you're the one causing the problem. You're rocking the boat that they've invested years in trying to keep calm and steady. They've put huge amounts of emotional energy into pretending that Lucy's behaviour isn't a massive problem that really should have been addressed years ago. \n\nAnd so the family has ganged up on you because, to them, \"everything was fine until Hairthrowawayx2 came along!\" Which isn't true, of course, but they had come to accommodate Lucy's behaviour and regarded it as something close to \"normal\" for them.\n\nI'm not saying your reaction was wrong. Where I live (UK) someone cutting your hair without your permission is a criminal assault. She behaved atrociously. Your husband has also behaved incredibly poorly by trying to get you to ignore it and, instead, blaming you for rocking the boat. This kind of family dysfunction does happen, though.

            "Tell your husband the *only fucking* person and reason to have someone do anything to your hair while you sleep is when you're undergoing an operation in the ER (from what I know they shave you while awake if the operation is planned, but I may be wrong).\n\nOther than that, it's good that you saw his flaws. I suggest you talk with your own family, probably your mother? You will find even more understanding than here and you'll have someone to watch your back and help, if it comes to a divorce. \n\nBest of luck!",
            "GOOD! This guy is obviously sick like his sister. Also, record EVERYTHING, especially concerning this fight, as you want as much ammo for divorce. Honestly, your original post might count as a record, show it to your lawyer. ",
            "Wow! What a crazy situation. \n\nMy grandmother suffered from a variety of mental health issues and used to say shit like this to my mom in front of all of us. It was her jealousy of my mom that provoked it. She wasn't liked (for obvious reasons) by her kids, so she punished anyone her kids did like. She would say something awful to my mom and then would be super sweet to one of us (her grandkids). She was very, very manipulative. \n\nThere is a key difference though. My father was super aware of how terrible she was to my mom, and prepared all of us by teaching is how to react to her when she was awful. \n\nIf she said something nasty, we were to ignore her completely. My Dad had some phrases he would use, but I don't remember them now. It would have been something like, \"Mom, that is very disrespectful.\" Or, \"You can't talk like that.\" \n\nI know there were times when we left abruptly. \n\nIf for whatever reason you decide to stay in your marriage, you'll need to arm yourself with some verbal/mental weapons. \n\nIgnoring (as you did) is the perfect response to attention seeking behaviour. Great job there! Unfortunately, what happens when you respond correctly is usually an escalation in behaviour looking for the desired response (cutting your hair=you now shout/fight with her). The only way to stop this nonsense is to stop seeing her (again, well done!) and deny her your attention. \n\nSurely she would pressure her brother when you're not there about why you didn't come, how terrible you are etc. etc. If he were to come back and share her frustrations with you, you'd be in a great position of power. You could then send a message back to her. Your husband could say something like, \"She'll come back and visit when you have  apologized for talking to her the way you do, and attacking her while she was sleeping. You need to convince her you'll never do anything like that again.\" \n\nEach time she broke that promise you would have to leave again and start all over. \n\nThis is a form of behavior training.\n\nNow to the real problem, your husband.  He has been taught completely incorrectly how to manage her mental health challenges (whatever they may be). He has been taught his whole life to placate her and that her behaviour is \"normal\". There is a lot of damage to undo that definitely could be undone with therapy and instruction in how to communicate with people who have mental illness.  \n\nIf your husband wants to save your marriage I imagine he would agree to therapy with you. It would be best if you also had individual sessions. He will think the therapist is attacking him and siding with you when his sister is brought up. I would research very carefully to find an excellent couples therapist. \n\nTo the people on Reddit who are shocked (understandably) by this story and are suggesting to end the marriage immediately, they have obviously been fortunate enough to to grow up in homes without mental illness. People can go through dramatic paradigm shifts, and your husband can too. \n\nUltimately, it's up to you. Do you want to try to fix it? Do you still love your husband or has the marriage been strained for a long time? Ask yourself a variety of questions like this before you decide. \n\nBest of luck to you. ",

Cutting your hair is a symbol for much more, and I'm sure she wasn't cutting your hair just to make you look bad physically, she knew mentally she would be in your head. So clearly SIL has some serious problems of her own if she acts like this at 40.\n\n\nP.S. please update us on how husband reacts if you serve him papers or bring up counseling \nGood luck OP stay strong!",

In the heat of the moment, everything makes total sense.  But weeks, or months from now, you might regret this.  Especially if there is nothing else really wrong with your relationship with your husband.  Now if this is one of those \"the straw that broke the camel's back\" type issue and there are other reasons you haven't mentioned, then that's another matter.\n\nGoing forward, I am not saying you take this lying down like a sucker.  You can choose not to talk to your sister in law, and that is something you can impose upon your husband as well.  You can make it difficult for him to interact with his sister.  However, it is his sister after all.  Family ties are stronger than logic.  You just have to help him understand, help him feel that his ties with you will be stronger than his ties with his husband.  I assume you don't have a baby with him yet, but if you are married, a baby is likely to happen.  Overcome this issue, and once he has a baby with you, he will be even more compliant to your needs.",

        "selftext": "Hi, I found this website a few hours ago and have been determining whether or not to post my problem and after reading a few other relationship posts, decided you guys could help me!!\n\nI am a junior in high school, I have a boyfriend who is also a junior and we have been dating for a year now. We get along so great and I have very strong feelings for him.\n\nMy mom is a single mom, has been since my dad left us when I was seven. I am an only child, I don't even have any half siblings, so I really only have a few friends and my mom. My mother and I get along well, we bicker and fight every now and then, but it's usually the normal mother-daughter squabble of \"clean this\" \"clean that\" \"why didn't you put this stuff away like I asked.\" She has this kind of skew mindset that all guys are douchebags since my dad was obviously one and emotionally abused her for awhile. (Not aware of anything physical, but I was young and they had been together long before I came along.) When my boyfriend, Jared, first asked me out, she warned me against all forms of abuse and she wanted to meet him. He's a great guy and she approved and at about the four month mark, took me to get the birth control pills. She didn't exactly want me having sex, but her exact words to the doctor were, \"I can't stop her, but I can at least protect her.\" Which is a totally cool way to look at it from a mom's point of view.\n\nI don't have a lot of girlfriends I can confide in, so I confide in this journal I have. I've been using it since July 6th of last year and try to update every other day. Sometimes I just rant in it or criticize others or my day, and sometimes I write long passages evaluating myself. I don't hold back and typically just let it all out just so it's not up in my mind. I keep the diary on my bookcase between a couple of books. It's a dark leather bound journal, so it doesn't stick out unless you're looking for a unmarked spine in the bookcase.\n\nWell earlier today, at around 8pm, I came home from the movies after a date with Jared. My mom was waiting for me, like usual, in the living room. I figured she wanted to chat me up about my date and the movie, but I noticed my journal in my hand and I immediately freaked out and asked her why she had that. She told me she was in my room putting some stuff away and noticed the journal sticking a little out from the other books. She said she was going to align it with the other books, but noticed it was an unmarked book and opened to figure out it was my journal.\n\nMy mom said she was shocked to see what she wrote. She couldn't believe I wrote so freely and \"let the hatred\" blind my usually good morals. She then went on to ask me if I was suicidal because I wrote like five or six entries about the ways of suicide and what it meant to me. I denied any of it and told her that not everything in the journal was true, there were stories I wrote in there, too, and I told her that everything in there was written at the heat of the moment. She wasn't really convinced, though, and told me she was throwing my journal out and was punishing me about everything she read about it. \n\nPunishments:\n\n1. I have to break up with Jared because I wrote too graphically and over romantically about our relationship, even though I spoke nothing of sex, my mother said she was worried I was \"in love\" with him, even though I've never used those words with him or in my journal.\n\n2. I have to see a therapist to discuss the possibility of depression for my entries about different times I was feeling blue and when I discussed suicide, no matter how hard I tried to tell her that my entries are over exaggerated because my emotions were fresh and raw when I wrote.\n\n3. I am not allowed to get my license now for apparently \"betraying her trust\" and not talking to her about problems this serious.\n\nI haven't broken up with Jared but I've been sent to my room and I'm grounded until my mom lifts the sentence. I have my phone but she is turning off mobile and I'm pretty sure she's confiscating my laptop tomorrow to go through all the stories I've written on my computer and to see if she can find anymore diary entries I've put on my harddrive (which there are none now, I deleted them.) I was going to get have my license in two weeks and my grandparents are giving me their old Honda Civic because they got a new car and I was so excited to have this freedom but now I won't be able to because I wrote innocent things in my journal.\n\nIs my mom right in this? Am I just being a whiny kid who doesn't know anything, because I don't feel like I can ever trust my mom again after she breached my privacy, read my secret thoughts, and then punished me for thinking/writing them. Any input would be great and I'll try to reply or update when I have a computer or wifi.\n\nUPDATE:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wh84o/update_my_mom_read_my_journal_and_is_now/\n\n---   \n**tl;dr mom found my journal, read it, and is now punishing me for entries in it and is making me break up with my boyfriend, not allowing me to get my license and forcing me to see a therapist over innocent writing. is she right or do i have the whole right to be upset and betrayed?**",

            "It was definitely not cool of your mom to go through your journal.  You are correct.  And, I feel like she's over-reacting big time.\n\nThe only thing I can see her being worried about would be the suicide entries, but that would just be from a protective place where she would want to make sure that if you were suicidal that she gets you the help you need.  But, it seems to me you were merely musing and not contemplating it for yourself.  So, I think that's messed up.  You have a good take on why she's wrong, also.\n\nWhat really stumps me is her motivation.  Why would you punish someone to this extreme if you thought they were suicidal?  Wouldn't you theoretically be exacerbating a situation that could potentially send them to their grave earlier than planned?  To me, this is the part that is truly backward.\n\nIt really sucks that you had to erase those entries from your laptop because of fear of how they may be used against you.  It's good to get your thoughts and feelings out on paper, but it's also good to be able to go back and reflect on what you wrote, see how you've grown, and maybe refine some of the seedier stuff you think has potential... I'm a writer myself and I hate that she's taking that away from you.  She's possibly stunting your growth!\n\nIt seems like she may be obsessing about you instead of dealing with her own issues.  If you're able, I'd get your grandparents involved.  If she respects her parents then maybe if you could win them over they could make her see that she's not only stepped over some boundaries, but is not responding well to a situation that she's created.\n",
            "My therapist tells me to write a journal, and to be honest about the things I put. Writing things down is a very healthy way of dealing with things, I think you should take her up on the therapy, but us it deal with your relationship with your mother. I know my mum is pretty annoying in a similar way,and my therapist has help me cope/respond to that significantly. Also with your permission, the therapist may be able to discuss things together with you and your mom and also explain to her how journals work and how they are a very healthy thing and that despite occasional dark thoughts, this doesn't mean you are suicidal or not normal... in fact.. for a teenager these are all pretty standard, and your manifesting then in a good way, rather than keeping it all in till you implode. \n\nlike u//John_MayerMaynot says \n>Why would you punish someone to this extreme if you thought they were suicidal? Wouldn't you theoretically be exacerbating a situation that could potentially send them to their grave earlier than planned? To me, this is the part that is truly backward.\n\nthis is all astounding to me. \n\n You seem very mature compared to a lot of the 16 years I read on here, so I wish you all the luck in the world, and I'm sure this wont hold out for long, explain to your boyfriend if you can whats happened, your mum might make you break up with him in front of her, maybe if you can prewarn him he'll know its not a real break up as such.",

            "A journal isn't meant to be taken at face-value, that's why they're meant to be very personal and private. Sometimes you need to express your chain of consciousness, let out all your crazy feelings and thoughts and then go back to look at them later and form a better context for your feelings and maybe learn something about yourself. It's a tool for personal growth. So for someone to go through your journal and then judge you for what you wrote, and even take punitive measures against you is more than wrong, it's unforgivable in my opinion. I've been married to my wife for 14 years and we share everything about each other. We fart in front of each other and babble nonsense when our minds wander, but I would never look through her journal unless she wants me to see something. Why? Because I know it's not something I could read and understand where she is coming from and what it means. Many times journal entries don't have meaning, it's just venting.\n\nEveryone should know this. Most people respect this. Your mom did something that she may believe is right, but it's not and it's very damaging to your relationship with your mother that she would violate your trust. I would write all of this in a letter for her to read and leave it on the kitchen table. Then tell her you're never going to keep a journal again because of this, and you will not trust her with your privacy and secrets anymore.\n\nIf she gives your laptop back (this is all kinds of wrong, this is thought policing) then you download [Truecrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org/), its a free program for making a password protected folder on your computer that the goddamn FBI can't crack. Then go ahead and keep a secret journal, and never, ever let her (or anyone else) intimidate you into giving up the privacy of what goes in your own head. That is yours and yours alone.",

She will help anyone who needs it. She keeps her dark side from her friends but shares with us. She also has never had access to scary movies until recently. She just has dark shit in her head. Killing people on paper helps her get it out. She's really damn good at it to. \n\nI can't imagine punishing my kid for the thoughts that run through their head as long as their life is together.

I can't say that wouldn't have freaked me a bit but again. I'm used to crazy artists so I would have taken what was actually happening into consideration not just a journal entry. If I was going to do that my daughter is already a serial  killer. Lol. Maybe she needs a professional to reassure her you aren't an at risk kid. Frankly you sound great to me!

I can understand why your mom may be worried about you, but she had no right to invade your privacy like that + she should try to listen to what you have to say about it, and how writing has been positive for you; she should try to understand. \n\nIf anything, if she makes you go to therapy, I would tell the therapist that your journal writing is very therapeutic for you, and I would talk about how you feel betrayed by your mother for reading something as private as a journal. Maybe you could use the therapy time to discuss your relationship with your mother.  If your mom will pay for therapy - take advantage of it (this coming from a broke college student).  Maybe even using a therapist as a mediator between you and your mother in this situation would be beneficial.\n\nI used to write too when I was younger - my mom found a few things and her reaction was very damaging for me.  I stopped writing for years for fear of her reactions again and my depression only got worse... It wasn't until I was a senior in high school that I realized just how therapeutic journaling was for me and I started again. So don't stop journaling if it is good for you! ",
            "Your Mom should not have read your journal. A bad breach of trust.  But, what is done is done.\n\nHer reaction is way out of line, and quite disturbing.\n  \n1)  Any parent should know / realise / remember the kind of romantic (or even sexy, or anger filled) gushing over a BF or GF one can do at your age.  It is 100% normal, and as your Mom got you on the pill and does not disapprove of Jared and most likely completely accepts that you have / will have a (or several) boyfriends, her making you break up with him is ....well, strange.  \n\nWhy should she worry about you \u201cbeing in love\u201d? (whether it was mentioned in the diary or not.)  Are you supposed to fall in love only at the age of 26?  Tell Jared you are grounded (or whatever the situation is), your Mom wants you to break up, but you won\u2019t do it.\n\n2) Your mom not believing you when you say you are not depressed / suicidal is also very bad. She can\u2019t force you to a therapist (hopefully.) If you decide to go to \u2018keep the peace\u2019 or \u2018comply with her demands\u2019, or truly feel coerced, show the therapist the diary and insist you are OK and don\u2019t need the therapist..  Or tell her you will go to a therapist if you both go!\n\n3) About the license there is maybe not much you can do. \n\nWhy exactly is your Mom punishing you - apparently in every single way she can without crossing legal lines?  What is going on here?  Why does she want to control every aspect of your life - your relationships (Jared), your mind (therapist), your communication (phone), movements (car)?  What is so bad about you in her eyes?  Was she at all like this before, heavy on groundings, picking your friends, setting very strict internet times, a bunch of other rules, etc.?\n\nIs she afraid of loosing you to \u2018growing up\u2019? Is she using the diary to implement punishment that she wanted to do before but had no excuse for?  Is she at heart a mean bitch whose true colors are showing? Is she struggling with bad problems of her own? Has she just temporarily flipped and will calm down? Did she flip because she read some negative things said about her? (This seems a likely explanation.)\n\nAll you can do for the moment, I think, is pursue exactly the line you have - you are not suicidal, it is normal think about and question suicide at age 16, etc.",

You never read someone's journal, ever.\n\nI once dated a woman who had three children, and for all intents and purposes I was really the only real 'father' they ever had. One weekend when they were gone at their psychotic birth father's we were cleaning the house and her mom found her oldest daughter's diary.\n\nShe kind of hesitated, said she thought she should read it. (The kid had a lot of issues.) I took it from her and told her no way. And that if she wanted to permanently ruin her relationship with her daughter, that was a really good start.\n\nPeople have to be allowed private areas in their lives. Spaces that are off limits to anyone but themselves. Places that they know are safe. Sanctuaries that will not be violated, and that will be respected by the people that they are supposed to be able to trust above all others in their lives.\n\nI'm really sorry your mom did this to you. And I hope a bear eats her.",
            "You mom is not right. First, she completely violated your trust by reading your journal. As a kid in your house, you don't have a right to privacy, but any good parent knows that it's important to provide for your kid. Second, your mother needs to understand that your journal is a space for you to vent and meditate. Nothing you wrote in there was unusual for a teenager and nothing violated her trust. I could see sending you to therapy for fear that you're suicidal, but everything else is ridiculous. She should not be punishing you, and she certainly shouldn't be forcing you to break up with your boyfriend, and she damn well should not take your property. I wish some of us were there to talk some sense into your mom, because this is how you ruin a kid and your relationship with them. ",
            "See the therapist - seriously. You will receive emotional support and learn to deal with your Mother in a reasonable manner. \n\nTherapists are good people to have your back. If you don't feel simpatico with one, seek another. They are not the enemy - I promise. \n\nYou take care and stay strong. Try not to be too anxious about things. This too shall pass. I promise.\n\n\n*Nana internet hug*",

            "I don't have a 16 year old, so I can't understand this from the point of view of a mother. \n\nHowever, I am an English teacher who teaches 13-18 year olds, and I have noticed that many of them (if not all), given the choice and the freedom to let loose on a topic, will pour their hearts out to me in their essays. \n\nWhen asked to write about \"my childhood\" or \"a lesson I learned the hard way\", the kinds of responses I get... I hadly ever penalize them for the (sometimes) graphic nature of their essays, or question the content unless it is very worrying. It is every teenager's *right* to use writing as a way of getting things off their chest. I cannot imagine why your mother would be so angry/frightened as to lock you up and with-hold your license, privileges, etc. \n\nIf I were you, I would write her a letter (or-email) pouring my heart out to her. She needs to know that you're not necessarily on the verge of either depression or delinquency. She needs to realise that you are behaving exactly like any normal adolescent would - withdrawing from her, trying to sort out your own thoughts, trying to see what is important to you. These are milestones that I would imagine any parent or teacher would accept in a person your age. ",

            "My mother is like this. She tries to make everything in my life to be the way she wants it to be. So, I'd like to start by saying how sorry I am that you're going through this. \n\nI'm 25 now and have a house with my boyfriend, and it still hasn't stopped. Moving out allowed me to create some boundaries with her, though. She still pushes and tries to get me to break up with him and move home where she can take care of me.\n\nI met my first love when I was 15, and around the same time I started confiding in my friends more than I did her. She couldn't handle someone else getting my attention. It was to a point where she planning on moving us to another state to \"save me\" when I was 16. I made straight As, was drug and alcohol free, and already had colleges looking at me for soccer. She thought that me wanting privacy meant that I was a troubled kid.\n\nThere's just some things you don't feel comfortable speaking to parents about. Such as boys, or being overly angry. I think a journal is very healthy. You were venting on paper instead of acting on anger.\n\nDon't break up with your boyfriend. There's nothing wrong with you having feelings for someone. Your mom will pull the parent card and say you have to obey, and she will do everything she can to make your relationship with him difficult.\n\nAt every point in life, privacy is important. Everyone needs space. A mother can be your best friend, but not in the same way you would connect with a peer. \n\nJust agree to go to therapy. It can be used to your advantage. Don't use it to go in and vent about your mom. When the therapist asks you about your journal, tell them exactly what you told your mom. It was in moments and it was a way to vent. You're not a depressed or angry person. You're feeling depressed and angry because you're being put on lockdown over your journal. Also about your boyfriend. You can't help that you have feelings for him, and breaking up with him won't get rid of those feelings. It may not hurt to tell the therapist that it has always been just you and your mom, and that you think she may be being overly protective because of her own experiences.\n\nBest of luck to you.",

            "My mom did that very same thing to me with some variances. I didn't have a \"right\" to be upset in her eyes but I was just the same. That's when I started hiding things from her. She blew whatever trust I had in her which is screwed up. Where do you go when you can't trust a parent? You go to the people you can trust and they are usually the wrong people. \n\nMy advice: you're young and college is super close. Leave and get your ass an education. While I don't condone lying, protect your privacy while still living your life. I would not have another journal or posting on social media sites like Facebook. If you lie, chances are good your mom will find out. After all, look at what lengths she's gone to just to know what's going on in your life. \n\nRemember that success is the best revenge. Look into schools, scholarships and know that when you have a daughter, you will handle things differently. Good luck!",

            "Therapist here....  First, you should see the therapist if for no other reason then to support you through this. Your mother is showing some pretty dysfunctional behavior, and it is unlikely she will hear you even if you use many of the rational things others have offered here. However, after you have had time with your therapist, some joint therapy might lead to some healthier interaction with her, and even push your mother toward some therapy to deal with the issues she is projecting into her parenting. It is often challenging for teens to have real communication with their parents. Most teens I see that are forced there by their parents I find need help with their parents more often then they are in serious jeopardy. Therapy will not hurt you, and will likely give you hope for a better relationship with your mother going forward. Good luck. ",
            "There comes a time when you have to be the adult. Have you heard how they train elephants? When they are babies, they leash them to a stake in the ground that they can't pull out, and even when they grow big enough that they are easily able to pull it out - they don't, because of the training.\n\nHer authority over you is that stake in the ground. It is mostly illusory. She is projecting her fears on to you. She violated your trust. You have to grow up fast.\n\nThe most important thing is not to lose your temper. No matter what. No screaming or reactions. Calmly state your case, and stick to your guns.\n\nIn psychology, this is the \"parent -> child\" relationship construct. As you grow, it should develop into an \"adult <-> adult\" relationship; but many parents are unable to make this change... so you may have to switch it around on her and be the parent and speak as though you were disappointed in a child's behavior. \n\n\"Mom, I am deeply disappointed that you would violate my trust like that; and that you feel sacrificing our relationship for this is worth it. You have demonstrated that you are unable to be reasonable and trustworthy and be an adult about this - so I have decided to disregard your authority. You had to know that this was inevitable, but I had hoped it would have been gradual and natural. But you have forced the issue, and made it necessary for me to make this hard decision.\"\n\nNow, that is the moment of truth. That will be the moment where the full force of \"angry mommy\" will descend like Zeus from Olympus. She will yell. She will insult. She will say all kinds of things - but these are coercive authoritarian methods. You must stick to your guns and not respond. You must be the adult, and let her be the child. Do not get angry. Do not yell back. Do not repeat yourself. If you do, you lose. You must allow her to demonstrate the truth of your statement through her actions - with absolutely no help or input from you. You must be as a statue. If she demands a response, a simple \"I am not going to fight about this\" will suffice... but only if absolutely necessary. \n\nAnd when she is finished...\n\n\"I'm sorry that you do not respect me enough to have a calm and polite conversation about this. I am going to go out and let you calm down. And when I get back, if you woukd like to converse like adults, then I would like to talk.\"\n\nAgain, there will be another blowup. Do not react or respond. Do not repeat yourself. Be calm. If it gets physical, do nothing to escalate it. She will be left alone to stew in her own actions. And if she has even one thing from you to stew in - one word... one push... one snarky look... anything - then she'll stew in that. She must be forced to face herself, and only herself. \n\nIf you are unable to do this, then you might as well acquiesce to her demands. There is one road out of this - and it is maturity and a calm and reasonable approach. You must now choose whether to be the adult or the child. \n\n*edit:* my one concern is the suicide stuff. Agreeing to see a therapist is a reasonable concession. That is a good idea. ",

We read all the time about teens attempting suicide, and she is clearly desperately concerned about this on your behalf, which has made her overreact in an irrational fashion.\n\nI *DO* think you should agree to therapy.  It will reassure your mother, and it may even be useful to you, even if only to help you deal with your mother's craziness about this.\n\nI don't know what you wrote, but for your mother to put you on the pill at your age is a pretty cool, open-minded thing to do.  It doesn't reconcile with a mad dragon.\n\nSo either your mother is just freaking out in overreaction, or what you wrote was truly disturbing and horrifying and she may be right that you need help.",
            "The only time I ever wrote in my (online, password-protected) journal was to vent. So naturally, all my journal entries were emotional. e.g., I'd be stressed out about exams, and rant about how I was going to grow up a failure and how there's no point in living if that's the case--stuff I didn't *really* mean, but wrote to vent out of frustration. If you only had my teen journal to evaluate me, you'd think I was 'troubled' or suicidal, when in reality I was a relatively happy teenager. I don't think anyone writes shit like \"dear diary, today was a pleasant, uneventful day; I hung out with friends, life is good\". ",
            "Wow. You're getting a lot of advice. Before you worry about whether or not your mom is a narcissist and all the rest of it give your mom a break. She's probably scared shitless about the suicide stuff; I know I would be.\n\nI'm an older mom than yours but I was smart enough to never read my daughter's journal for exactly this reason. I knew it would freak me out. She's an aspiring author. \n\nIn her case, she was given to thoughts of suicide and self harm. She was seeing a counselor and we were lucky to get a good one because frankly, a lot of them just plain suck. I was concerned about my daughter , but I also knew she could be overcome by hyperbole, particularly in her writing.\n\nSO I DIDN'T READ HER JOURNALS!\n\n(By the way, she was the one who requested the counseling, she didn't trust my judgement and thought a 3rd party would give more balanced feedback)\n\nYour mom sounds as if she's reasonable most of the time and has your best interests at heart. Maybe she needs time to let things settle in her own mind. Give it a couple of days. Let her do her thing and keep your chin up. If she hasn't failed you before have faith that she won't now.\n\nI know you must be panicking a little yourself, this happened so fast and you were blind-sided. This is a tough age for both of you. You are truly your own person and separate from her; no matter how much a mom prepares herself for it, the more you grow apart the more she is going to have to adjust to changing her role in your life. She probably thought she would have all the answers and that you would go to her for them. Kind of got the rug pulled from beneath her.\n\nIt's going to be tough on both of you for a while because this is just the beginning. Hopefully, she will learn to handle these changes with more grace.\n\nThere are some pretty crappy parents out there, that's for sure, but I don't think she's one of them. I hope not anyway.\n\nNo. She should not have read your journal.\nNo. You should not be punished for it.\n\nI'm projecting here, what I would do, but if I were to go so far as to confiscate my daughter's digital communications and immerse myself in them it wouldn't take very long for me to feel ashamed of myself and it wouldn't take me very long to remember, really remember, what it felt like to be 16.\n\nIf worse comes to worse, go through the motions and remember that this too shall pass. I wouldn't worry about breaking up with the boyfriend right now, but if you're grounded tell him legitimately that you can't speak to him for a week or whatever.\n\nPlease don't decide to run off and get married or some other whacky thing in order to defy her or hang onto him. You sound like you're too smart for that but I've know I've done some pretty crazy things when I was upset and betrayed. Just don't do anything permanent.\n\nAnd really?

And I was a really good kid.

            ">I have to see a therapist to discuss the possibility of depression for my entries about different times I was feeling blue and when I discussed suicide, no matter how hard I tried to tell her that my entries are over exaggerated because my emotions were fresh and raw when I wrote.\n\nThis is the only part I don't disagree with. Your mother is genuinely concerned for you and wants to be sure that you're safe. I can understand her wanting to be absolutely sure that everything is OK. If you wrote about suicide this does make some sense to me.\n\nEverything else seems quite unfair. Your mother cannot force you to break up with your boyfriend. That isn't even reasonable. Throwing away your journal/diary is also very unfair. Those are your memories and that is your personal property. Punishing you by not allowing you to get your license is also unfair. Besides, she can't stop you from getting your license. You can go there yourself, get someone else to transport you. You don't need a parent's permission, I don't think. I'm in my 30's now, though, so it's been a long time since I got my learner's permit or my license. I doubt she can prevent you from getting one, though.\n\n**Edit:** I wouldn't rock the boat with the whole license thing, though; it may just make things worse. I was just saying she doesn't have as much power over you as she would like. Bring this up in therapy. **/EndEdit**\n\nI feel that your mother is going way overboard with this. **But hey, if you need to go see a therapist you can use the therapist as a mediator in this dispute so you can try to sort these things out. Use this opportunity to discuss these issues with the therapist alone, and then request family sessions between yourself, your mother, and your therapist. Maybe your mother needs to have an adult professional explain to her that she may be going about this in the wrong way and you can all work this out and agree on a game plan to approach this entire convoluted situation. The privacy issue is a major thing you should bring up in therapy sessions. Family therapy sounds like it's going to be your friend.**\n\nYour mother throwing out your journal/diary is only going to piss you off more and make you rebel further. Her demanding that you end your relationship when there's no good reason is also probably going to make things worse. Taking away the rest of your freedoms, your ability to communicate online with your computer and your phone, are also going to lead to more issues. Be sure to bring all of this up with the therapist.\n\n**Also, ask the therapist if you can contract for your safety. I've had to go to therapy in the past to deal with the whole suicide thing. Ask about contracting for your safety. Essentially you, with the therapist there, would draft a contract where you will agree to not harm yourself in any way or ever discuss suicide or write about it unless it's serious, and if you are seriously thinking about it you will go to your mother or your therapist to get help and to be safe. This should alleviate your mother's concerns and your therapist should find that to be a sensible solution to this issue.**\n\nIn the future, if you ever want to keep a diary, do a better job of hiding it if it's a physical book or consider keeping an online Wordpress, Blogger, or other free blog account that is protected by a password and is set to private so that only you can see your entries if you log into the account. This way nobody can find it online unless they know both the web address/link/URL and the user account and password combination. It's obvious now that your mother is going to get upset about even innocent things you write about. I'd also be very careful about hiding any fictional stories or poetry you write to express your feelings or even just to experiment with writing in general for the same reasons.\n\nI hope this works out for you in the end. **Definitely make good use of this therapist! The therapist could be your ticket out of this mess.**",

She got pregnant before her high school graduation, and divorced the boyfriend she married after a year, leaving her to raise their son on her own until she married my dad when she was 23. She's pretty jaded towards high school boyfriends.  Anyways, I was punished for having sex (we used protection) with my boyfriend, and she drove me to my boyfriends house, insisted that he come out and talk to us, and then she yelled at him for an hour or so about how he'd stolen the last piece of innocence in her life. Despite me explaining how devastated I was over her breach of my privacy, she went on to read more of my journal a few days later (keep that in mind). We went to a therapist, who my mom fired after she evaluated me as responsible and emotionally mature. Now I'm 23 and living on my own, my parents have divorced, and my relationship with my mom is jaded at best. I visit her because she guilt-trips me when I don't, but she's disrespected me too much, and hurt my father too much, for my to voluntarily associate with her more than I have to. That journal reading was the beginning of the end for our relationship.

            "I once was mandated to psychiatric counseling.  It was for being a violent person.  One of my tasks given by the shrink was to write out things that made me upset.  I tried this a few times and found it handy.  \n\nLater I learned that writing out personal thoughts is excellent in moral development, self-reflection, and overall psychological stability in some adolescents. \n\nAny way, one day a teacher upset me (I saw something happen and wouldn't tell him who did it).  I wrote the entire one hour and thirty minutes of class very vulgar things about the teacher, and at the end of class happily threw it away.  He dug it out if the trash and had me do a writing assignment out of nowhere to which I reluctantly agreed since he was just a homeroom teacher, but I was always in trouble and not looking for more at the time.  He fucking compared my handwriting and turned the shit in to the police, not the principal.  I did a lot of community service for following explicit therapudic instructions. \n\n\nYour mom is wrong, personal thoughts are personal and nothing more.  If it was me I would've just made sure you weren't on meth or anything too crazy and NOT BEEN CLEANING A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ROOM.  \n\nsorry for story time i felt it was relative. ",
            "The breaking up with your boyfriend thing is ridiculous.  And the drivers license thing is an overreaction.\n\nBut as someone who has experienced depression and has young relatives who i'm somewhat of a parental figure to, I agree with her about asking you to see someone.  Unfortunately, it's not quite as simple as just going into an office and seeing someone.\n\nHere's why I say that:\n\nThe fact is that most people who do not have suicidal thoughts have no idea of how they would commit suicide if they were to do so.  If you do see someone about depression, a psychologist will often ask you \"have you thought about suicide\", and you'll say \"yes\", \"no\", or \"uh, i don't know. I guess I've thought about how to do it but now that I would do it\".  Or something to that effect.\n\nAnd they'll ask you \"how would you do it if you were going to\" (probably regardless of your answer).  The reason they ask this is because like I said, most people who don't have suicidal thoughts don't really have an answer to that question.  Or if they do, it's usually the very generic \"cut my wrists\" or \"shoot myself\".  If it's any more elaborate than that, you most likely have thought about it some at some point.  That doesn't mean you're suicidal.  And it doesn't mean you were suicidal at the time.  But it's a red flag.  A red flag is not a guarantee that something is wrong.  It's just a \"hey, take a closer look to make sure nothing is wrong\" thing.\n\nIt really may have just been a story and not genuine thoughts.  And it may have been in the heat of the moment and \"raw\" (isn't \"raw\" about as true as it gets though?  You haven't had a chance to make it sound the way you want it to come across to others).  But it's still a red flag to your mom.  And \"it was just a story\" or \"it was just the heat of the moment\" are the kind of thing that people who are suicidal often say when confronted in that way.  Again, that doesn't mean you can't say those things without being suicidal or that they're not true.  But you need to understand that it's pretty much expected and it's not really as assuring as you may think it is to people who know a little more about it.\n\nI don't know what sort of thoughts you genuinely have or do not have.  But if you ever really have had those feelings (even just int the heat of the moment), you may actually find it helpful to see someone and talk about it.  And don't fool yourself into thinking \"everyone has thoughts like that sometimes\".  No, not everyone does.  It doesn't mean it's bad to have such thoughts, but a lot of people never have those sorts of thoughts.\n\nThe tricky part is that seeing someone for that sort of thing isn't like going to get a nasty cough checked out.\n\nYou have to trust people to open up about those things.  Which means it may take many visits with someone before you're really comfortable opening up and being entirely honest.  And the first person you see may not be a good fit.... or the second or the third.  But you have to give them a chance and realize that you may not walk in one time and everything be resolved.\n\n\nSo, yeah, I think you're mom is over reacting in a lot of ways.  And I think a couple of the things are a little \"too much\".  But as someone who has personally dealt with depression and someone who has young family (your age) who have dealt with such things, I completely understand her concern about the possibility of depression.  And as someone who has dealt with it... it took me YEARS to really accept it. i.e. I convinced myself for years that it was just \"the heat of moment\" and that everyone had similar thoughts and feelings just as much as me.  And if I could change things, I would have talked to someone about it much sooner.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying that you are or were depressed.  I'm just saying that the things you're saying about it are what A LOT of people who deal with depression have all said to themselves (and others), including myself.  And that's why it's difficult to just walk away thinking, \"ok, she said she's fine\".  Do you understand?\n\nBut most importantly, it can't hurt to see someone.  You may be surprised and find it quite helpful in a variety of ways.",
            "A similar thing happened to me. I had a journal at the same age and used it to vent about the frustration I had with my mom at the time rather than fighting with her. I felt it was a healthy way to deal with it. She herself encouraged me to keep a journal to sort out my feelings when necessary. Anyways, one day she read it and was angry I had written not nice things about her. \n\nI told her I wrote those things in the heat of the moment when I was upset and that writing them down made me see I was overreacting and glad I hadn't said them aloud because I didn't really mean them. \n\nShe didn't take my journal away or punish me or anything, but I stopped writing in a journal from then on because part of me was worried she was looking through my stuff after that. I was never even up to anything bad at that age. I felt she unfairly viewed me as a \"typical difficult teenager\" but most of my angst was surrounding what to study in college and having a very young brother in the house which caused a lot of extra stress as you can imagine. It was a crunchy time between us that eventually just blew over, but I was very confused, as I sense you are. I understood it was my parents' house and what I did there was my business, but I felt she had crossed a line by reading my journal. I didn't understand why she didn't just stop reading when she realized it was my journal. \n\nNow slightly older, I understand more from a parent's perspective why she read it and was upset at reading mean things about herself, but I still don't think it was right and I still believe that while a parent does have a right to know what's going on with their kid, you don't get to snoop unless you have a warrant, and by warrant I mean a really good reason to suspect your kid is up to no good. I was up to no such things and it doesn't like you are either. \n\nIn the end, this is the part I have never gotten over, even a decade later. I see my mom differently since then because she always said she trusted me and I gave her no reason to stop trusting me, and yet she broke my trust that day. I believe a person's thoughts are their own no matter whose house they live in, and it's better to write down nasty thoughts than to act on them. But I just file that away in my Things to Remember When I'm A Parent handbook. \n\nThat wasn't really advice, but I just wanted to say I've been there and it does change your dynamic, but you can repair it if you want to. The advice others have given is good. It sounds like your mother needs more help than you, and therapy is actually great. I'd recommend it for anyone. A therapist will be able to see your situation from both sides equally, and will help you with calm and healthy ways to talk to your mom and make your relationship better.",
            "I'm reading this in response to the post to best of reddit. And it's been 15 hours. But hey, it's my 2 cents and I can throw it where I want.\n\nI'd personally tell my parent in this situation that I felt like they were over reacting. Let them know you feel a violation of privacy and a loss of trust in her. Acknowledge they are your parent and you are under their authority. Let her know you are hurting. Let her know you feel she's damaged the mother/daugher relationship. And above I would seriously suggest you go to therapy together. And STICK WITH A THERAPIST. I had an ex who had serious problems with his mom. As soon as the therapist sided with him, his mom would declare the Dr a quack and move them to a new Dr. Which helped nothing.\n\nMake sure you tell your mom you want to have a talk. No shouting. Tears are ok. But don't get caught up. If you find yourself overwhelmed or at am impasse. Ask for 5-10 min to calm down. Make some tea or coffee. Try to avoid \"terms\" and name calling. Be as calm and adult as you can be. Nothing throws a parent for a loop like their kid calmly discussing a situation like this. This means possibly writing down what you want to say. We adults do it at meetings all the time in our job lives. \n\nAll of this may happen and your mom may still not be reasonable. Adults are weird sometimes. We have baggage and it's hard not to freak out when we think we see someone about to purchase the same luggage set. My mom did it to me growing up. Hell. I'm an adult, and married and my mom said something unintentionally hurtful about 3 days ago that's STILL bothering me. But I can look back on what I know of her life story and know she's trying to protect from her mistakes, my sister's mistakes, my dad's mistakes. I'm the baby so I've been projected on a lot in my life.\n\nLike I said. Make a deal with your mom to see a therapist. Together. Agree to find a therapist you like and STICK with them. Let your mom know you love her. Even if you don't feel it right now.\n\nAs for your boyfriend. I'd explain things as unpassionately as possible to him. You don't want to turn him against your mother, especially if this relationship continues on. It may damage their relationship together in the future. ",
            "I am a little late to this conversation, but I just wanted to applaud you for keeping a journal and using writing as a \"safe space\" and a way to express, explore, vent, experiment etc with your feelings.\n\nWriting is an extremely powerful tool, and I think it's extremely important to have that kind of \"private space\" in which to unpack your feelings or even \"try out\" different feelings by getting them into writing.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that I'm really sad your mother doesn't understand the value of keeping a journal or what it means to write things from a \"raw\" place, even when they are not true.\n\nI totally understand what this is, and I hope that you can find another more private and secure place to keep a new journal where you can feel comfortable opening up and confiding again.\n\nI'm 31 years old, and I still keep exactly this kind of journal. Several of them actually.  I have a space in Google Drive where I keep some journal entries, a physical notebook by my bed where I keep others.  I also have an anonymous blog I post to that is not connected to me in any way that I sometimes post to.\n\nWhatever new form you use, (physical notebook that you keep with you in your purse or bag, online blog, or Google Drive or whatever) I really hope you keep writing a journal.  It will help you understand yourself and know yourself more deeply than any other tool you could have.  Don't let your mom take that away from you just because she doesn't understand how writing like this works. :)",
            "Is this really a fresh incident? If so your mom is probably just freaking the fuck out. She had no right to go through your stuff and but she did. So she probably read it, was blind sided by it thinking you were growing emotionally a certain way the she reads something that is different and it probably scared her to realize her little girl isn't so little any more.  \n\nI also say this because everything you say she is doing sounds so ridiculous for a mother you say is otherwise pretty reasonable. Give her a few days. Once she calms down then you can set some boundaries because she should respect your space. \n\n\nSource : Son of a crazy mother",
            "It sucks that this happened, happened to me too, long ago.   Lesson that was learned, don't keep deeply private things where others can find it easily.   Imagine if you learned ten years from now, that your husband doesn't respect your privacy, or someone gets a hold of it and publishes it.   A diary is a powerful tool for ones self, but its also an exercise in secrecy and a potential vulnerability, so there are trade offs.  At least now you understand the risks and potential complications.",
            "I'm going to comment on the off chance that this DOESN'T get lost in the sea of answers even though there's over 300 already. I think your mom is seriously overreacting and it seems almost as if she was looking for an excuse to deal out this punishment. Maybe she's just freaking out about you growing up.\n\nIt's hard to get moms to listen though when they are already so deep in this mindset. If you don't have aunts or grandparents to talk to about this, I would say your only option is whatever therapist she sets you up with. I ended up doing therapy for awhile too. In the end, my therapist asked for a group session with my mom and dad both attending. He told them I was the normal one and they were the ones that needed to be in therapy. I hate to say it (because I have a great relationship with both of my parents now) but he picked apart my mom like crazy and called her out on all of her antics. Honestly, even though it took her a few more years to change (and by that time, I was old enough to not put so much weight into her thoughts and words when she tried to tear me down) it was the most freeing thing to hear somebody with authority say to both of us that she was the problem. \n\nGood luck and keep your chin up. Therapy isn't all bad! Especially if you don't have your journal to vent to anymore.",
            "First, I just want to say that you seem like a very level headed individual, especially for your age. It's refreshing to see! \n\nI do not think you are overreacting, but if you were my daughter, any mentions of suicide in a journal would be a little worrisome to me. I wouldn't punish you for it though. But I probably would insist on seeing a therapist. I think therapy might be beneficial - especially if you can get your mom to accompany you in some sessions.\n\nI don't think breaking up with your boyfriend is an appropriate punishment, or that you really should be punished at all based on what you've described here. Maybe, like your journal writings, your mom has just reacted in the heat of the moment, and she will calm down and realize her mistake. It was probably a lot of information for her to absorb all at once. \n\nGive each other some space, and then try to approach her about the situation tomorrow in a calm and collected way. \n\nGood luck!",
            "Your mom shouldn't have snooped around in your journal in the first place. It's a big violation of privacy. If I caught my parents reading something so personal without my consent I probably wouldn't talk to them for a while. She made a great lapse of judgement to ground you as she discourages you to share your thoughts with her since you risk the chance of being punished. She sounds like an overprotective parent. Therapy would probably be a good idea.",
            "Your mom is messed up and needs help is the short of it. Punishing for things writen in a diary is thought crime punishment and that shit is all kinds of fucked up. \n\nPunishment 1 and 2 are things that under no circumstance should be used as punishments. How messed up is she to really think using a therapist as punishment is going to be effective punishment or good for your mental health?\n\nYou are 16, old enough to GTFO if she does not get back to her senses. If your grandparents are reasonable get help from them",
            "My Mom used to use any excuse to get into my room and \"find\" things... \"I was putting some glue away in your desk\" or \"I wanted to tidy up a few things for you\". I came home one day with her holding my diary, too. I also had the privilege of reading certain passages out loud to her. Graphic passages. Not necessarily of things that I did, but more of things I wanted to do...or simply just thought about. I was angry. I felt betrayed. I felt I couldn't trust her any more after that. \n\nLook, you only get one Mom, so read all of the advice in this thread (there's some good stuff here!) and then do your best to keep a good relationship with her. Tell her exactly how it made you feel...don't get dramatic about it. Be real.  Whether or not her punishments and reactions are normal or not isn't for us to judge. But what you can do going forward is share your feelings, share your hurt, and be honest with her. This is just a blip on the radar as far as mother/daughter issues are concerned. Worse things will come up, but how you deal  with this issue might set the stage for how future blow ups are handled.\n\nI am sorry for this invasion of your privacy. I know exactly how it feels.",

He completely punished me and even though there were comments about being horribly depressed, he used that to yell at me about how unappreciative I was of my life.

It may be good for you to have another healthy figure in your life to talk to about things that isn't your mom.

            "My mom did something somewhat like this, but it was with a letter my ex sent me when I was in middle school. My mom is an abusive woman so there is a big difference here. He lived in another town so we wrote each other. We were sort of serious(dated a year and 3 months), do some of our letters were steamy by middle school standards. Mostly making out stuff since I didn't care too much for sex. \n\nShe let me know she had it, locked herself in the bathroom to read it. Took it to work the next day to have her coworkers read it. She showed our neighbor too. I had CPS called by my school for another incident and we had to go to therapy. I thought that was going to be my ticket. My mom told me she had every right to read my letter because she was older and it was her house, I was a kid and had no right to privacy. \n\nThe therapist, who was supposed to explain to her that she should respect my privacy, sided with her. He knew about the abuse stuff and said that I should just listen to her.\n\nI'm hoping you get a great therapist. Your mom may see what she did as wrong and end up apologizing during the session or even beforehand. She's definitely projected her situation onto you. I wouldn't mention that to her though, it may anger her more.",
            "Oh, man. I've kept a diary from a very young age.  I'm almost thirty, and I still get incredibly upset if someone violates my privacy by reading them. I would recommend password protected computer documents in the future.\n\nI do strongly agree with your mom about therapy, but you guys should go together. I have yet to meet a therapist who disapproves of journaling. It may be helpful for your mom to hear from an outsider with experience that you keeping a journal is far more healthy than holding everything inside.\n\nAs far as the boyfriend goes, I would say put him on the back burner for a week or two. You should absolutely let him know what's going on (to the extent you are comfortable with). If he's a good guy, he should be able to give you some space to work through these issues with your mom.\n\nI may be out of line here, but it is possible she is projecting the feelings she had for your father onto you. You're turning into an independent adult and not sharing everything with her. This may remind her of your father keeping secrets and them growing apart. This is not your fault and there is nothing you can do about it. But if she wants you to go to therapy, make her come too. You guys can split sessions or go together, but your mom could probably benefit from some insight from a professional.\n\nIf you guys have gotten along well this far, there is no reason you shouldn't continue to. As you said, your mom is one of the few important people in your life, and there is no reason she can't continue to be. It may take a little work, but good relationships are worth it.",
            "~~My  suggestion would be to ask your mom to save the journal for the therapist to read. Then when you get one on one time with that therapist in the session, you can tell him/her your side of the story.~~ **EDIT: Found out your mom ruined your journal. If it isn't too late, get all the stories/diary entries that you have on your computer onto a flashdrive and bring that to the therapist. Your mom will most likely exaggerate to the therapist about your situation so you will need some things to back your story up.** If what you said above is true, the therapist will probably talk to the mother about what she did. Personally I don't think your mom is in the right but she is probably just traumatized from what your dad did to her emotionally. \n\nThe reason that she is so concerned about you right now is because she probably has had the same problems before(suicide/depression ect). Try to see things from her perspective a bit but just know that she is definitely in the wrong here. She is doing her job as a protective parent, but she is a bit TOO protective here.",
            "Your mother is correct in thinking you should see a therapist. A 16 year old girl with few friends, an over-protective mother, and passing thoughts about suicide should see a therpist. I'm sure you'll feel better for having a trusted adult you can confide in and who might actually guide you. Please try not to see it as a punishment. Try to get someone who specialises in teenagers. Hopefully you'll then have an ally who can discuss more effective parenting habits with your mother and, possibly convince her to seek therapy as well.\n\nNow that's out of the way, as a parent, I can assure you that you're not being a whiny kid. Your mother violated your privacy. Despite what she says, it's she who has shown she can not be trusted - not you. As a mother, I'd be hurt my daughter didn't confide in me as well but that would make me think we needed family counseling. The fact that you have chosen a decent young man to date and that you chose writing as an outlet rather than self-medicating or lashing out shows that you are growing up into a responsible young woman. It doesn't sound like your mother is of a mind to listen and understand that point of view at the moment so perhaps therapy will get you two there. Best of luck.",
            "Wow...\n\nFirst of all, I'm sorry you are having to deal with this situation. Your mother had no right to read your journal without your permission. Writing is a very good therapeutic exercise where you can get all of your thoughts out (which is what you were using it for). \n\nGo to the therapist. As everyone else has already said, he/she will be able to help you find a way to communicate with your mother. And try to get your mother to start seeing a therapist too, or at the very least have some sessions that include her.\n\nWith your boyfriend, does he know about this situation? He needs to know that your mother is trying to interfere with your relationship, and that you have strong feelings for him and don't want to break up just because Mama went a little cuckoo over your journal. Ask that he be understanding and patient. He needs to also know that if you ever do break up, it will be because the relationship has run its course and not because of your mother.\n\nFor your writing, a therapist will most likely suggest that you do keep a journal. Get one that has a lock on it, or that can be locked up somehow away from prying eyes. There may be some kind of online journal that can be accessed with a password (be vigilant of signing out and make sure you are the only one with the password).\n\nGood luck!

I think she was trying, since she did accept Jared and did get your birth control, however I don't think it was a complete acceptance. After all, how can she expect you to have sex with a guy who you don't feel romantically inclined towards or don't love? She can't punish you for feeling things though, the same way you can't punish someone for being hungry and craving a cake. \n",

You need to stick up for yourself and tell her that what she did was not okay and that you shouldn't be punished for having feelings and writing them down. Having a journal is a good, healthy thing, far better than keeping negative emotions bottled up. As for telling you to break up with your BF, that's none of her business either. I understand she went through a bad relationship, but she shouldn't let that make you think that having a boyfriend and being in love is a really bad thing.\n\nDepriving you of getting your license also doesn't make sense to me. You didn't 'betray her trust' by having a journal and you haven't been acting out and being irresponsible. Taking away that freedom doesn't make sense in the light of what's happened, it just sounds like a way to control you.\n\nIt sounds like even if you try to talk to her, she won't be reasonable about this, so you could try getting a third party involved, a person or people who she trusts and respects and sit down with them and tell them the situation and get their take on it. This must really suck and I'm sorry you're going through this. Good luck!",

So, under the guise of \"light housekeeping\", my mom's friend went into my room (at my mother's request) and read my diary and REPORTED BACK TO MY MOTHER ABOUT IT, whereupon my mother confronted me about me \"feeling depressed\" and \"acting out\".  Uhm.  Yeah, mom.  I was thirteen and you'd just left all of us.  How was I supposed to be feeling?  Happy?  Empowered?  Suddenly free to pursue my dreams?\n\nWhile I have a reasonably functional relationship with my mother at this point, it is now thirty-years-later and I'm still effing pissed about the journal incident for its extreme crassness and betrayal of trust.  I wasn't on drugs, I wasn't having the sex, I wasn't doing more than every other damn kid my age in my county.  And I was attending school regularly and getting good grades.  I just wore a lot of black and looked absolutely miserable and sullen.\n\nYour mom wants to help.  But she's kind of sucking at it.  Being upset and betrayed  even if it makes a lot of sense, is not going to resolve anything and may complicate your relationship with your mother unnecessarily.  Be the adult, here.  One of you has to.",

Diaries are meant to be private.   \n\nI'm a 50-yr old dad of a grown daughter, and when she was growing up I would NEVER read her diary--never EVER--and I would NEVER go in her room without her permission. I knocked EVERY TIME; I didn't complain if she locked it.  Which she often did, but for good reason (although reason didn't matter...it was her reason to have not mine).\n\nKids need privacy at home. REAL privacy, that they perceive to be locktight (even if it's not...another conversation). IF THEY DON'T GET PRIVACY AT HOME, THEY WILL FIND IT ELSEWHERE.\n\nParents respecting their children's privacy is just that: RESPECT. And if the parent wants respect FROM their kids, they need to show it TO their kids.\n\nPeriod.\n",

I used to write random thoughts in it and one day my friend got ahold of it and wrote idiotic and crazy things in the journal.. I came home with this guy who I was internested in dating and she confronted me about the journal by calling me a tramp and saying \"only crazy people write this kind of stuff\" while the guy was in the living room waiting for me to go sledding.. but we moved passed it and got over it , your mother is over reacting but she's doing it because she cares and knows she can't really control your life and it's probally frustrating her.

            "Perhaps suggest to we to go into counseling together, to have an unbiased third party there with you? Make sure she does NOT know the therapist beforehand though. This would have the added effect of placating her wishes and, hopefully, the counselor telling her she is way out of line. 2 birds with one stone!",
            "36 year old dad with 14 going on 15 year old daughter and a 17 year old son. \n\nI'm sorry you're mom has betrayed YOUR trust. Rule number one in my house is kids have a diary, we don't get to look in it. Why? Because sometimes a journal is a healthy place to relieve stress, even if some of the things contained inside are essentially meaningless. That being said, we will break that rule **IF** we think one of our kids is doing something extremely harmful. \n\n\nMy daughter feels confidant that she can speak to us, but she also knows that her stuff is her stuff and that we don't just arbitrarily ransack her room looking for something to gig her on.\n\nI can understand some of your moms perspective, afterall, we just want you guys to be safe... but she's forgotten what it was like as a teenager and the need for teens to begin experiencing LIFE. It's not like you are going out every night robbing banks and getting stoned. \n\nI want you to know, it's hard on us too. We want you to become the adult you're supposed to be, but we remember when you took your first steps and to us... that's always going to be you. So when boyfriends and girlfriends become apart of your lives... we like to know what's going on",
            "I'm so sorry you have to deal with this.  Your mom sounds like a kind lady who cares about you and is generally reasonable but who has heavy baggage.  And the way you talk about journalling sounds very reasonable and healthy, but I can imagine it would be VERY scary for your mom to read.\n\nI've had my journal read before and it felt like such a violation.  Ugh.\n\nThat said.  Go ahead and see a therapist.  It will make your mom feel better, and it will give you someone to talk to (even if that's not something you feel a deep need for).  Make sure and shop around if you don't hit it off with one right away--sometimes it takes a while to find the right therapist.\n\nA therapist would also act as an objective observer who could listen to your concerns and perhaps help your mom see the error of her ways (she's definitely overreacting from the sound of things).  Also, everyone has baggage to deal with--maybe this person can help you discover ways to more effectively navigate life, regardless of how well you're already doing.  Introspection is great!\n\nDo you need your mom's permission to get your driver's license?  I don't remember that part, but you're still a minor, so maybe it applies.  If not, I would say to save up money and go get your license anyway.\n\nAlso, don't break up with your boyfriend over this.  Your mom's totally projecting on you.  Take her words of caution, but with a grain of salt.  There are very real consequences and risks and heartbreak to any relationship, especially when you're new to it.  Just be careful.  Don't be afraid of love, though.  That part sucks.",
            "Your mother is not right, it's pretty normal for moms to get worried about something like this , but she's fucking overreacting. You have to break up with your boyfriend? Are you fucking kidding me? You are 16 years old and can probably decide wether you want to break up with him or stay with him, that's not your moms business unless he starts abusing you, also it's incredibly insensitive for her to go through your own personal journal, she say's you broke her trust? Are fucking serious she if anyone broke yours. You'd think she would not read it but she did. Your using your journal to express yourself and to vent things out which is great! Much better then keeping it inside. It pretty much seems like she does not trust you and thinks of you as a little child. But your almost an adult now. If she refuses to try to understand and listen then she's not that great of a mother. Sorry for writing such a long wall of text lol.",
            "You sound incredibly mature for your age.",
            "She is punishing you essentially because you have some depression/suicidal ideation entries.  Wow I'm so sorry :( You deserve much better, I hope you are able to move out after high school.",
            "So your mother wants you to tell her your problems and feelings even though she reacts this way when you do tell her? I know what it's like for parents to not take your feelings and emotions seriously. It makes you feel small and helpless. Like you aren't a human being worthy of being taken seriously. ",
            "Ok... here goes.\n\nYour mother may be a narcissist, sure. But I don't think any of what she's said or done comes from that. I went through something very similar when I was a teenager and this is my take on it. \n\nIn a similar post things were addressed step wise, so I will mirror that here. \n\n1) \"She was worried I was 'in love' with him\"\n\nAs a parent, you're \"job\" is to raise an emotionally well rounded adult. From her perspective I can see two reasons for her reaction. 1) she doesn't feel you're emotionally ready to be in a relationship where love is involved or 2) she doesn't think that Jared is a good choice. In either case, she's concerned for your emotional well being. The way she's going about it might not be the most productive, but she's coming from a good place (IMO). Approaching the conversation as \"I feel lucky that I have a parent that looks out for me and wants me to develop into a healthy adult, but I need to experience these things myself. Maybe things with Jared aren't forever, but as it stands we haven't said \"I love you\" and even if/when we do that's the normal course of any relationship. I might get hurt, but I know that I have a loving supportive mother who will help me get through it and this is all part of developing into an adult.\"\n\n2) You wrote about suicide\n\nOne of the major concerns of parents these days is that your child is suffering silently and depressed/going to kill themselves. Look at the news, it's ALL over the place. Writing about suicide (even when you're just processing feelings) is a red flag to most parents. Your mom is again, concerned about your emotional well being. Sounds like a pretty awesome mom to me. BUT she's trying to make you go in to therapy. Honestly... what do you have to loose? You mentioned that you don't have a lot of people to talk to, and writing in your diary is a good way to process things. Think of a therapist as a trained, interactive, 100% confidential journal. That therapist won't speak a word to your mother about ANYTHING you talk about. Patient confidentiality. And they might even be able to recommend ways that you can speak with your mother about letting you have privacy/freedom. \n\n3) She's with-holding your license.\n\nShe's being reactionary. She's human, it's what we all do. She's scared that you don't trust her enough to talk to her. She wants to protect you, but she's being overly controlling to do it. But what she's not realizing is that violating your privacy and getting angry doesn't build that bridge. She's looking at this as an ends justifying the means. It's crappy, it really is. I think having a level headed, no yelling, non accusatory conversation about it with her might really help her feel more connected with you. But I do think it's useful and important to point out that she violated your privacy and trust but in turn is asking you to trust her with your feelings and deepest thoughts. \n\nYou sound like a really great 16 year old, and your mom sounds like she loves you a lot and only wants the best. It's always awkward and frustrating when a child starts becoming a young adult. You're going to want more freedom because you feel older and mature, she's going to hold back in part because she views you as a young and maturing (but not yet matured). Try and not look at this as a one person is right argument but as a redefining boundaries and the way you view each other **conversation**.\n\nThis is natural and normal. You're completely right being upset and angry, but how you deal with your anger and hurt is what will help you develop and help your mom realize that you're developing in to an emotionally healthy, well rounded, young adult. \n\nGood luck, I hope it works out for the best! :)\n\n**tl;dr** Your mom sounds like she loves you and wants the best for you, but is going about it in an overly protective and controlling way. Start a **conversation** not an argument. Take the free therapy, it'll be worth it. And it sounds weird, but being mature about this and not yelling will help your mom realize how much you've grown and that she can trust you. \n\n**edit for some formatting",
            "You have a right to have a diary, and write whatever the hell you want in it! \n\nAdversely, she has absolutely no right to read it!\n\nIt's none of her business what you write about your boyfriend. You're allowed to be in love with him, especially if you're having sex for Christ sake!\n\nI think you should be equally as annoyed that she betrayed your trust and invaded your privacy by reading your diary. \n\nAnd one more point; sounds like SHE is the one that needs to be in therapy.

If you feel you could use an objective third party to talk to go to the therapy. Maybe even with your mom. It could help ger cope with your growing up too and lead to compromise. As for Jared, make your own choice if he is wonderful and you care about each other don't ever let anyone make you end a relationship unless it is hurting you. Good luck.",
            "when i was in HS i had a friend who went through something similar- the therapist ended up going totally against her mom and for my friend, because privacy is important. so i'd say agree to the therapy ",
            "My stepfather did this to me. To this day I still refuse to keep a journal anymore. It was very traumatizing. Im sorry this is happening to you. The top comment seems pretty accurate though, this is a problem with your mom, not you. You did nothing wrong. ",
            "Wow reading this brought back a memory I forgot I had. A similar situation happened to me when I was younger, had a journal parents read it and punished me for it. The shitty thing was they had proposed to me to start writing one in the first place. This was a great tool for me because I have always been shy so I literally never talked with anyone about my feelings or problems. After this betrayal of trust I burned that shit and never started another. This resulted in me keeping all my emotions to myself which probably contributed to me having sducidal tendencies and I even started cutting myself. I eventually learned how to be happy on my own, but that was mostly by distracting myself with activities and self medicating. These also had drawbacks, I have been arrested a couple of times for possession of marijuana (my choice of self medication), and the activities that I distracted myself with were far from safe. These ranged from skateboarding (not that dangerous) to street racing (stupidest thing I have ever done, and I did it quite a bit). I feel like I kinda went off on a rant but what I was trying to say is don't let this breech of trust lead to you shutting out people emotionally, people need to unload their burdens or it can lead to self destructive habits. I still haven't recovered but I'm trying. Once you shut down it is incredibly hard to open up again, so please if you do not go to therapy find another source to vent your emotions.",
            "I know what you are going through. I had this exact situation happen to me when I was 15 (I am now 30 with a 10yr old daughter of my own). My mom flipped too. She also worked a lot and nothing ever really came of it besides me not trusting her even more. Although later she did end up sending me to boarding school because she thought I was doing things that I wasn't. It wasn't too bad though. I made a lot of friends that I wouldn't have otherwise. \n\nI don't know your mom so I cant speak with certainty. It sounds to me like she got really freaked out and over reacted. I don't know how long it's been since this happened but I would say follow /u/kmdr 's advice and be patient. Especially talking to other adults that can talk to her. Parents do not get a magical book that tells them what to do for every situation. Neither do they just magically know how to handle things. Everyday is a learning experience. Just like any other person sometimes people react badly. I am also a single mom and I know that I have made mistakes and overreacted to things that I shouldn't have. This does not make it okay but I hope my daughter will know one day that I love her and sometimes that love makes me scared. I hope that things turn out ok for you. And remember that you don't have too long before you can be out on your own. This phase of your life will be over before you know it. ",
            "I'm so sorry about this, I was in your position last year when my parents thought it would be good wholesome fun to go and read through my Facebook messages to a close friend of mine. I'm still not sure how they got into my Facebook, as I'm really cautious about that kind of thing. \n\nI just think it is ridiculous for you to be punished because of something you wrote privately. Nobody else would have seen it if your mother hadn't invaded your privacy, and if anything, in my opinion, she was almost asking to find something she didn't like. Diaries have everything, like you said. Especially if you're a writer. You can't just accept what you read in a single diary entry as true for every day of your life. Now if you were seriously discussing suicide on a daily basis then I could see why there would be an issue but you weren't.\n\nAnyway I think she's overreacting, sorry about the rant. If I were you, I would tell your therapist what's going on and ask her to speak with your mother. I go to a therapist for stress and some family things and it helps a lot. When I can't speak to my parents about something, she can, and oftentimes parent's will be more willing to conform to a person with a masters degree or a doctorate than their child (which is unfortunate). The therapist could be a serious blessing in disguise.",
            "Without knowing everything thing all I can say is this, you seem like responsible and thoughtful 17 year old. Your mom did a great job and it shows. \n\nIt seems to me that she is trying to protect you from her mistakes, reasonable for parents to want, but at some point as a parent we have to let our kids fall and get hurt. And you will. She can't change that. Just try and keep that in mind. \n\nThe mentions of suicide would make me step back and want therapy for my child as well, even if it's only to make me feel better. It is a safe place for you and could really help you as you become more independent as you grow older and go off to college. \n\nStaying as calm and open as you are able while talking with her will help. Ask her what the specific things she is worried about are, make her verbalize what worries her. Then talk about how you two can lessen her worries. \n\nGood luck. She's a lucky mom",
            "Before I even read any of the other replies; this sounds exactly like the stuff my mother used to do to me. She'd search my room and punish me for what she found (ie: an old Coach purse a friend had given me for my birthday that my mother had never seen, with a $20 bill in it. She assumed I was selling drugs, because how else could I have afforded a purse and had money she didn't know about?) She threatened to take my phone away to check my messages when I was younger because my teacher called saying I hadn't done my homework and she wanted to know why. I left my diaries hidden or on me at all times. I knew not to leave things where my mother could find them. Even now, I'm 23 and since I'm living at home I know she goes through my stuff.\n\nYou are 16, so there is a little bit of \"you're still a kid (sorta) so she's gotta look out for you\" BUT it's not right to punish you so severely. You're not wrong in feeling the way you do. But she's also not wrong to be a little worried. The only one of the punishments that is justified is making you see a therapist, and that's only because even if you know that you don't intend to harm yourself as your mother it would be wrong of her, if she suspects an (mental) illness, to not have it looked at by a doctor.",
            "Granted it has been a while since I got my first license, but I'm pretty sure you do not need a parent or guardian with you to get your drivers license.

Just watch the mail truck and grab your plastic once when they mail it to you (your legal guardian can open your mail for you and I'm pretty sure that destroying someone's drivers license is not considered destroying a government document).\n\nLegally your grandparents cannot give you their car, they can only let you borrow it while holding the title or transfer the title to your mother in trust that it will be transferred to you upon turning 18 (you have to be 18 years old to own anything from the view of courts and the government unless you are emancipated).\n\nAnyways, hope this helps with the #3 on the list at the least.\nNAL.",

Hell, she can't even leave her house if it isn't for school or work or she has a family member escort her. HER mother is crazy.

            "I just came out of a relationship with a girl who grew up living with her narcissistic-single mother. I can't speak for you or all girls who grow up with that hardship, but I can reflect on what I've learned. It was only a matter of time before I started to experience behaviors from my girlfriend that her mother had. Behaviors that were selfish, hateful, bitter, and gave me plenty of reason to slowly build up resentment over time.\n\nShe had the option to get therapy but never did. There was just nothing I could do as a man to continue supporting and uplifting her. Every time I came over, she was crying, upset, and angry. My excitement to see her and take her out was constantly destroyed by her behaviors. She eventually relapsed into old drug habits and cheated on me.\n\nListen to me when I say this: Take the fucking therapy. It's easy to underestimate what living with a woman who has that mindset will do to your future. Your father may not have been \"the\" douchebag, and it takes much more than meeting a good man to be happy. You also have to be a good woman and make the right choices, feel the right feelings, and be able to avoid compulsion and unhealthy temptations. People tend to become abusive towards abusive people, much like the resentment you're building towards your mother already. How do you think your father would have felt if she treated her relationship in the same manner? People love people who love. Good therapy will help you get that.",

            "As someone with untrusting, misunderstanding, overly protective, overly sensitive, and worried I'm going to join a gang and drop out of school, parents........you just gotta understand that they are trying their best to be a good parent the best way they can.  In her mind, she thinks you might be headed down the wrong \"path\" for whatever reason, for suicide, love, etc., so she's doing what she thinks is right to intervene. \n\nI think the best way to through this disconnect is talk like an adult, and have her understand that her worries are irrational.   Acknowledge that you understand her concerns.  If you're not on the same page, arguing will go nowhere.  Get on the same page and put all her concerns out there. Ask her what her concerns are and ask what you can do to fix it. Bring up her own past and ask her if she's thinks that has any effect on her concerns.   Basically respect her concerns and her thinking, and break everything down logically to erase her concerns.\n\nI think this is the best approach in my experience.  Holding out or being stubborn just makes things worse.  I think the last thing you want is to create distance.   Usually I would give it time, like a few days to a week, then I approach my mom.   Likely she'll be thinking about it too over the course of the days.",

            " My mother and I never had a close bond growing up, so I always hoped she'd read my diaries, because in a way I was telling her all the stuff I've been wanting to tell her, but never could tell her, because she would never listen to me.\nI would have been happy for my mother to read my diary, for her to finally know what was going on in my life for once...\nbecause she never knew, and I wanted her to know.\nI wanted her to know about the day I had, the heartbreak, the loneliness, the depression, etc.  I never had anyone to talk to growing up about this stuff.  It would have been nice for someone to hear it. Well, in a way when I wrote in my diary, I felt like I was venting to my mother and pleading for her love and affection.  My mom never seemed interested in the least bit as to how I felt, who i was friends with, how school was going, if I was teased, if I was happy, my emotional state, what I wanted to become, what I liked to do, NOTHING.  \nYears later, I found out she had been reading my diaries all along.  In a twisted way, I was happy.  I never felt she invaded my privacy, because it was the only way I could communicate with her.  It was like I finally knew someone had listened.",
            "I would personally tell my mom to mind her own business, do whatever you want. She must provide for you until you're 18 or you can sue the shit out of her.",
            "you betrayed her trust how about her reading your diary?",
            "No she is obviously going through her own dipression, I feel she may, instead of taking herself and fixing it she is taking it out on you.",
            "It's not fair for you to be punished for writing down your personal feelings. Unfortunately your mother is upset right now because she's found out you have secrets she knows nothing about and has no idea how to handle if",
            "Hey, look, someone spied on something private and used it to punish the person for things that no one else was supposed to ever see.\n\nNow she's going to have to be careful what she writes in her journal.\n\nLooks like another proof that Snowden was right to me.",
            "My 10 cents. As a single father of two older boys, here it is.\n\n1. Agree to therapy but ask her to participate in the sessions. If you can make it a condition, make it, but don't be forcefule or biligerant about it. Ask her too. She may need it as much as if not more then you. And in this situation may give you a third party allie. You may even get some good out of it.\n\n2. As far as breaking up with your friend, Tell her if the therapist sees your relationship as unhealthy you will throttle it back, without question. Liekly yor therapist will change her mind. Hopefully.\n\n3. As far as license and car. Talk to you grandparents and see if they will talk to your mom. Maybe get them to discuss boundries and mutual trust with your mom.\n\nAbove all love your mom. She loves you obviously.\n\nMy ten cents of advice.",
            "Not to be a dick here, but your mom needs dick.",
            "The relationship between my father and I was similar to yours and your mother's. But instead of getting punished for having privacy I was just grounded for pretty much whatever reason he felt like. This Jared until I moved out after high school and went to college. Unfortunately, high schoolers don't realize how much control they really have street high school. You can literally do whatever you want and go wherever you want. I hope that you and your mom reconnect the next couple years because it sounds like she might hang higher education over your head, which my father did to me. Just know that no matter what, you CAN get out of the house and go wherever you want, even without your parents paying for college. It's what I did and it was the best thing for me to get out of such a hostile environment. I know you still have a few years until then, so what I'm saying may not even matter in the end. I sincerely hope you never ever have to go through that and that you can reconcile with your mom! I just thought I would get it out there, because having a parent or both hinder your future schooling is too common! ",
            "My personal thought, don't let it change you no matter what ends up happening. Stay good, stay true, and every day you wake up, think about what you can do to make your self a better person than you were yesterday. Also, no matter what fucked up things she does to you (which this is really fucked up what she did) always know that she loves you, and no matter how late or impossible you may think it could be, she can always change for the better. I went through really really bad times with my dad. He did some things far morefucked up than this, but, he turned his life around. And has COMPLETELY changed. Idk if your in to metal music, or heavier music rather. If you are though, or aren't, you should give Stick To Your Guns a listen. They are really good guys, and there lyrics are based around love, and not giving up in life, as well as having hope for things to always get better. Hopefully you read this. Or someone else, and hopefully who ever reads it will at least find my words of something remotely meaningful.",

            "This is utter bullshit, do not do any of those punishments, it is humiliating. I keep a journal and let it ALL out, hate love rage, sadness, happiness. It is good to get it out and \"talk it out with your self\"",

            "Thanks to this thread I discovered that I've been raised by a Nmom. All the specific details of our relationship are there. My biggest fear is that I'll turn into my mother. I don't want to be that person.",
            "Maybe this has been said, by note now, but I'm guessing people are confusing family \"counselors\"with therapists/psychologists.",
            "Your mom definitely is in the wrong.\n\nBut being a parent is scary shit. You tend to overreact to everything. It's best just to try to talk with her and have her understand, maybe ask her if she was ever feeling what you were feeling when you wrote in the journal. ",
            "The whole point of journals is to write whatever you want in them without worrying about others seeing it and as a form of release. It's completely normal to have negative thoughts and write it down to get it out of your system. Nobody's prefect. I've done it before and I ended up being normal, probably more normal than the people who keep their emotions all pent up all the time. ",

            "I'm really sorry. I'm only 4 years older than you, but I understand. My mom was kind of like that when I lived with her, but I moved out when I was 17. \n\nYou shouldn't feel guilty. Violation of privacy isn't cool for any age. Is there any way you could sit and talk to her when she is calm about how you feel? I kind of doubt it, but it's always worth a try.\n\nOn the therapist part, the therapist would likely think your mom was the one who needed therapy...",
            "Let's be honest. For a teenager at your age, it's beyond surprising that you're not completely blowing up on here and giving a one sided story. I'm 18.. I sound all disconnected with the age group, who am I kidding? But no, seriously I'm surprised you're calm to a point that you've considered your mother's side of the story. Most people our age would blow the fuck up and go punch-drunk, ranting all over the place and discrediting themselves with rash language. Personally, I think your mother's completely in the wrong. It just doesn't add up that she allows you, or at least wouldn't stop you from engaging in any sexual activities. But then goes rampant about her worries with how she's afraid you'd fall in love with the guy. And like others have said *(I hope this doesn't offend you)* but your mom seems to be the one who needs to see a therapist, because there are a few screws loose judged by that logic. As for going to therapy? I'm sure that's a good idea, other people have commented the same, and I feel the same. \n\nYou are in no way, whining about this. Because you are not in the wrong, and second of all, you're unbelievable diplomatic about this even though she's threatening to remove a lot of privileges from you. And, while I've never kept a diary myself despite of going through some rough patches in life, I can understand that writing it all out in a diary is another form of venting. This relates back to when you wrote: \n>She couldn't believe I wrote so freely and \"let the hatred\" blind my usually good morals.\n\nI'm sure keeping a diary and blowing steam about the *\"blinding hatred\"* was part of the reason why you have been able to keep your good morals. I'm not speaking for you but it's a great possibility that it's contributed to you keeping composure, rather than bottling it all up until you snap. \n\nSo yeah, go to the therapy sessions. It may work out somethings unrelated to the incident, or it may progress and be able to shine light in what's actually your mom's overly-aggressive actions. Best of luck with everything regarding this situation! Would love to hear back from you!",
            "Lesson learned: don't write secrets in a journal.",
            "i dont think you did anything wrong.  it will be tough but i hope you both get through this.  I suggest seeing the Therapist together as this issue sounds like its more with your mum than you.",
            "See, this is why I never kept a journal. My mom went through my room frequently and disasterously. She would fling all my stuff everywhere and then make me clean up the mess, even though she never found anything.\n\nI wouldn't have put it past her to read a private journal, so I never kept one. I never learned how to keep one. I grew up as the type of person who would just bottle their emotions until the explosion happened.\n\nI'm slowly getting over it.",
            "Ok so I can absolutely empathize and level with you on this. I am currently 24, but once upon a time not too long ago I was a 16 yr old with an overly attached mother who also snooped and found my journals. She was the same, \"disappointed\" in the things I wrote about, angry with me, and wanted to punish me in similar ways- taking away technologies, grounded, break up with bf, etc. And I believe you when you say it's confusing and frustrating to deal with. My advice is to act as adult as possible without\nComing across as hostile and a smart ass. The advice from the top poster is all excellent and I would definitely follow it as you see fit. Mostly I'm here to reassure you that you are not alone in this experience, and that it may seem hopeless and so very dramatic and horrible right now, but this will absolutely pass. You have to be patient with mom, she's just overreacting. I completely hated my mother when I found out she had invaded my privacy. \"Children have no privacy\" is what she told me. But now, looking back, I know she was only looking out for me and reacting out of some strange\nmotherly love. Don't do what I did. Don't allow yourself to be mad at her and remain mad for the next few years. While I can't imagine ever wanting to read the things any of my potential future children would write in their private diaries, some parents can't help but snoop. Do the therapy. It'll be good for you either way. Having a safe place to speak openly about your feelings is incredibly liberating and if it'll appease mom then all the better. If Jared loves you, he'll understand that things just got complicated and he'll stick it out. And most of all, HIDE your diary from now on. Don't let this unfortunate event stop you from writing. But don't leave those personal thought laying around for someone to happen upon. \nI don't know how else to tell you that you are not wrong, and that your mother should have respected your privacy and understood that things written in journals are hardly ever 100% serious (and that so much of the thing written are emotionally charged), but mom is just scared that her baby is growing up and she doesn't want you to make bad decisions and end up all sad and heart broken. Understandable mom feelings.\nHang in there. Don't let her guilt trips or \"punishments\" mess you up. Continue to grow into your own person with your own thoughts and feelings and ideas. And never abandon the way you think or feel just because someone you care about doesn't agree with you. It's all part of the growing into your own person experience. Unfortunately, not every step in the experience is an easy one. ",
            "My mom once went through my phone and found every text I'd sent my girlfriend at the time for the past 2 months. We talked dirty about things we did and what we wanted to do, even some stuff we lied to our parents about. My mom was disappointed in me, but I also felt this distrust for her. My conversations were supposed to be private, but she broke that, so now she has all of what I did with my girlfriend in the back of her mind. She didn't punish me but it wouldn't have made a difference. I'm sorry that you're going through this and I know how exposed you probably feel. You sound like a perfectly normal being. I think your mother has trust issues with you for reasons that don't involve you.",
            "*\"You can't gave your licence..\"* \n\nSure.. How would she control that..",
            "you may also want to agree to therapy, and invite your mom to join you at the counseling. then you can get an independent perspective on the issues your mom raised, and involve your mom in the process. GOOD LUCK! you'll be ok. ",
            "From what you've written, it sounds like you're totally in the right here.  We all need somewhere to vent out feelings.  I've actually thought about the idea of death a lot, but I know if I bring it up with my parents, they'll get worried for no reason.  It's not like I plan on killing myself.  I just know my own mortality, and there are certain things I want to happen at my funeral if my life was cut short.\n\nAs for what to do, first, try to save the journal.  I hate it when works of art are censored.  Put a lock on it and give it to someone you really trust.  Jared might be a good choice here.  If you need to get it back from your mom, tell her you need it to discuss with your therapist.\nSecond, go to the therapy sessions.  Venting your problems to a trained professional can be very relieving.  Don't be afraid to insist that your mom not be in the room during the session.\nThird, and this one may take awhile, talk to your mom about why she became upset at the idea of your diary.  Based on the reasons you listed, it sounds like she wants to be someone you can confide in, and tell everything to.  She might also be scared that you are getting close to a man when she had bad experiences herself.",
            "You're mom is being overly protective because she doesn't want your life to turn out the way hers did. Her intentions are good but the way she's going about this is like over the top imo.",
            "We are all human, and we all make mistakes, this includes parents, my kids are pretty grown up now my youngest is 25, I made some silly mistakes, I have done my best to say sorry, and our relationships have been strong enough to survive.\n\nI hope your relationship with your mother survives and that you mend the wounds between you.\n\nLove and Light to you both."
