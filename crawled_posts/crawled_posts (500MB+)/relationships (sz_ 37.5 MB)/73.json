        "selftext": "i though i would provide an update to my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/azopg2/i_16m_got_into_an_argument_with_my_older_brother/). \n\nsomeone advised me that i write my brother a letter apologizing, which i did. i apologized for being mean and hurtful, and that I was wrong for doing that. i also got him a separate card and wrote a message thanking him for everything he's done for me. I went to his house with my letter and card when I found out he was home to go talk to him, but unfortunately when I got there he was gone already, so I slid them under the door. \n\nWhen he got back home he found them and read them, and then he called me to arrange to come see me. He came over here and I apologized in person for what I said. He was very straightforward with me and honest about my actions. He explained that the reason he had been avoiding me lately is because he needed some time apart because he was beginning not to like me. He said loved me, but I he didn't want to be around me sometimes.\n\nThat was pretty hard to hear. He said that lately I've just been not very nice, the comment about our Dad was by far the worst, but I make other snappy comments. He had tried to brush it off as me being 'just as teenager', but had now decided it was best to let me know. \"Being a teenager is not an excuse to be a constant asshole to everybody at home\", is how he put it. He gave a few examples and looking back he was absolutely right. \n\nIt was pretty upsetting to hear. I know he wasn't saying it to upset me, and I was thankful that he was telling me (or at least I'm thankful now). I promised that I would check my attitude, he said a little more thoughtfulness was all I needed, and that even though sometimes I act like an asshole he knows I'm not one. After we finished talking we hugged, he told me not to forget that he loves me and that I'm great. \n\nSince then I've been trying to be more considerate. I really am trying to follow the advice he gave me. It's been a couple months now, and I'm happy to say that it's working. Our mom told me a couple weeks ago that Im a joy to be around. In the car earlier today my brother told me that its been really nice spending time with me lately. so thats good news. \n\nTL;DR apologized to my brother for the terrible thing I said to him. he warned me that I was turning into someone that he didn't want to be around, even though he loved me. i've worked on fixing my attitude over the past two months, and today my brother told me its nice to hang out with me these days.\n\n Edit: wow, wasn\u2019t expecting this to get big. Thanks for the advice, and for the gold. Much appreciated.",

            "Hey man, I had a similar experience - when I was 16 my group of friends essentially had an intervention and let me know my defensiveness and argumentativeness was driving them away. Now, nearing 30, I am beyond grateful that I had friends who had the guts to be honest with me and give me a chance. I asked them to point out when I was doing it and respected them when they did.\n\nNow I make a point of inviting quiet people to speak in groups because I am aware that people like me drown out important voices that may be too timid to speak up when a bunch of loudmouths like myself are arguing. That one conversation changed my life for the better. I am glad you are being given the opportunity to see how  your behaviour affects others from another perspective. You will slip up, but growing up is all about generally trending upward in behaviour, not being perfect!",
            "This is such a great update. \n\n  \nI was told the same thing as a 16 year old and I just decided to play the game for the people I needed to like me. \n\nIt took much longer for me to realise that genuinely being a nice person was actually an end goal in and of itself because when I was approaching the world from a nicer frame of mind, it responded.\n\nYou've learned something many people take much longer to learn and bloody good for you. Keep it up :)",
            "Hell yeah. I was awful at 16 and would not have owned up to my behavior like you are. You should be proud of yourself",

I wish I did sometimes!!! sSeems like you are a smart kid,and turning your life around! Good job!! And it sounds like your mom is impressed and happy that you did ..and your brother is to!!!Keep up the good work!!!",
            "OP, as you go through life you will be right about some things, and wrong about others.\n\nYou will think you're doing good, when actually you're doing bad.  Or you will lose sight of yourself and have a desire to do bad, and maybe lie to yourself about it later.\n\nYou will find yourself in situations where it's impossible to know whether any of the above applies to you.\n\nThe only thing that can insulate you from all of that is to be who you are being right now:  A person who is willing to be honest with himself, willing to face truths even if they suck, and willing to change.\n\nRight now, you're displaying arguably the best of all human traits.  Your humility and good sense are things you should be proud of, even though there will be times when they feel like a weight around your neck.\n\nSo please, take some time to be proud of yourself.  You deserve it.",

            "You do realize you made a important choice : you accepted that you had been wrong and you apologized. \n\nThat act alone can put you ahead of so many people out in this world of varying ages. \n\nGlad to read that your apology was accepted and you reconnected with the family.",

            "Hell yeah man. Having people close to you, who genuinely care about you, call you out on your shit - it\u2019s fucking great. It\u2019s how you grow as a person, and it\u2019s much more straightforward a process than having to realize it on your own (usually after a much longer time). Additionally, being able to hear and receive criticism like that - that\u2019s a fantastic trait to possess. Good on you, man.",

            "I\u2019m also the youngest sibling by 10 years. When my mom lost her battle with cancer, my older brother abandoned me. Tried to steal my tiny portion of the inheritance. Tried to claim furniture I didn\u2019t have because he liked it better than what he already had. Told bold faced lies about me to family members so they would take his side. Which they did. \n\nI never did anything to wrong this man. To this day I have no idea where this came from. Regardless, he\u2019s dead to me. I haven\u2019t spoke to him in years. And hopefully I never will again. Though I must admit, I sometimes fantasize about him coming to me to apologize or better yet, be in desperate need of help. So I can spit in his face and tell him to go fuck himself.\n\nYour story about how your brother stepped up and helped you through a great time of need makes me jealous and sad. Make sure you always appreciate this person. Not because of some irrelevant blood relation. But because he sounds like a genuinely good person who really cares about you and will always be there for you. Don\u2019t take that for granted.",
            "I'm so happy to read your update. When I read your original post it broke my heart to hear such things being said between brothers during such a time.\n\nSo glad you were able to speak with him in honest terms and move on from where you guys stood.",

I've met people two or three times your age who can't do it, so good for you. You are lucky to have people in your life who will tell you the hard truth because they love you, but the fact that you are willing to listen and work on yourself says so much about you and the life you have ahead of you. I wish you all the best!",
            "Recognizing when you have messed up and turning your behavior around is one of the hardest things to do in life! You should feel good about the changes you have made and how you have been working to think more about other peoples' feelings. This update really warms my heart.",

To elaborate on phase, being an asshole gets a point across for now that you'll fogure out an alternative and more efficient method for soon, by my assumption. It's hard and i don't doubt losing your father is unparalleled but your brother sounds cool and you're on here giving a fuck so you guys got this. You sound like a good fam",
            "Aww this is so fantastic! Good on you for changing instead of being defensive. Hope your relationship keeps thriving!",
            "That's awesome man. With family (as long as things haven't gone toooooo far), you'd be surprised how forgiving people can be if you genuinely apologize and change your behavior. In families we all see everything about each other \u2014 the good and the bad. Part of the frustration when you're angry with family is knowing how great a person can be when they are at their best and not getting that from them often enough.

            "Changing your behavior can mean so much and make you so much happier as a person!\n\nIn elementary school, I was harrassed specifically by boys, but there were a couple girls who also treated me like shit and it gave me this pisspoor temperment where I would literally smack people's chests or arms if they got too close to me.\n\nI moved for middle and high school, and was not harrassed at all, but I was still very explicitly defensive and tired and struggling, and I realized within a few months that I didn't know why I was still responding that way; I didn't want to hit these people.\n\nEventually, a boy my age showed me platonic affection and I realized that I was really, really touchstarved for platonic love. My mood shifted entirely to be more compassionate and considerate so I could maybe get more hugs from people.\n\nI'm proud to say that the habit is broken, and I'm still giving hugs to anyone who wants them, male or female.",

This is a huge push you've made towards being a kind and mature person both now and in the future. You will look back on this period in your life as the beginning of you truly becoming the person you are destined to be. Reminds me of my own teenaged years. Honestly tearing up a bit.",

            "You know what, it doesn't matter how old you are, we all make snap judgements and say things we don't mean at times. I think you sound like a very sensitive and close family. It's wonderful that you can all be so honest and caring with each other and that at only 16 you have shown a wisdom and maturity alot of people will never achieve. You managed to turn an awkward situation around, you were genuinely sorry and you made an effort to change things. I think any dad would be very proud of this family.",

            "I\u2019m so late to this thread, but I wanted to commend you for doing the right thing here. Grief manifests differently for everyone, and losing your dad right when you were hitting adolescence likely had a bigger impact on you than you think/thought. I went through some family-related trauma/loss when I was a couple years older than you are right now, and it turned me into an absolute asshole for a year or so, specifically to the people I loved the most - because they were safe targets, I knew they would never leave me. Doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t harm my relationships with them, though, and making amends was so hard. It took a lot of courage to reach out to your brother the way you did.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you went into therapy after your dad\u2019s passing, or if you\u2019re currently in therapy, but I encourage you to look into it if you haven\u2019t.(There are a lot of online options now, which I\u2019ve heard are a fantastic starting point if you\u2019re not sure about going into someone\u2019s office and sitting on their couch.)

I do think that a lot of it has to do with you being a teenager, and I'm not sure if you fully appreciate what that means, but it's likely (and you might not believe me when I say this) that your behavior will mellow out as you grow. I was a complete dumbass as a teen, most of us have been. If you think you're regretting your actions now then wait till you're like 21-25 years old and you get like a flashback of your past actions and just embrace the amount of cringe and regret that it brings then.   \n\n\nAnd it's great you've worked on your attitude, most teenagers I know don't do that.

[Here is the original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/45hogk/my_22_m_girlfriends_21_f_dad_bought_her_a_10k/)\n\n\nShe got ready as usual in the morning, and hopped on over to our favorite breakfast spot. when we were done, she said something like, \"this is so thoughtful, how wonderful we get to spend this morning together. thank you, thank you\" which got me all excited because I knew she was expecting to go home afterwards, but SURPRISE! We get in the car and head further north. she was all like, \"what's happening?\" and when we stopped at ANOTHER coffee spot, she burst into laughter saying, \"oh my gosh are you serious MORE coffee? you really want to spend the day with a lunatic?\" to which i respond, OF COURSE.\n\n\nand when we get to seattle she's still giddy. we live close to seattle but hardly ever get time to just walk around and enjoy seattle because it's normally business, or we're just too busy ourselves to have a leisure day. we go to little shops and look around and she loses herself in some kitchen shop for a good hour and a half (seriously). and once again, she's like, \"wow, this has been incredible thank you for this amazing day\" thinking we're about to go home, and that's when I give her the watch! she starts crying and says that this is the most thoughtful thing anyone has done for her. and she LOVES our anniversary engraved into it. she even said, \"ah! I don't want to wear it because I don't want to hurt it!\" but put it on anyway. in fact i feel like she was flashing it off :) which she never does with any jewelry.\n\n\nand then, we were going to go to dinner but the restaurant goofed and didn't write down our reservation. she wasn't upset at all and suggested we go to *Chipotle* for our v-day dinner! so we went and she loved it because she said it was the perfect day where she didn't have to be \"on\" or \"too formal\" and \"boring\" with her family. she then laughed and mentioned how weird it was that her dad got her a watch and so did i, and that she's so grateful for me and our relationship & not to be intimidated by it all because she prefers \"this way of living\" (relaxed? i guess?)\n\n\nanyway, we got home later than expected, and she got me some sort of couples coloring book, a handmade card, and a batch of cookies. we colored and ate cookies until she fell asleep... SMILING. she fell asleep smiling. I'm the happiest man alive. Thank you Reddit for telling me to continue with my v-day plans. i never would of went through with it without everyone encouraging me. it makes me laugh because after everything was said and done, she said \"we spent the entire day together and it cost *nothing*\" haha. \n\n   \n**tl;dr**: went through with v-day plans, everything turned out better than expected. she loved the watch and the entire day. thank you to everyone who told me to go through with my plans.

            "> where she didn't have to be \"on\" or \"too formal\" and \"boring\" with her family.\n\nHonestly there's something to be said for this. A lot of the time people will have masks or personas they have to use around family or specific friend groups, to help fill the niche or expectation they inhabit in that sphere. It can get taxing to have to keep up that image day in and day out.\n\nSometimes it's nice to just relax without any airs needed. You don't always have to be funny or prim and proper or what have you. You offer her a chance to just be her, and be appreciated for it. That's invaluable.",
            "Nice update!\n\nAnd as with most jewelry, you cant really have too many watches.",
            "This makes me so happy! And it's yet more proof that money isn't everything. A lot of people who grow up with unlimited amounts money around them often find security in us regular folk because we learn the true value of money and enjoy the smaller things in life. Not everything has to be flashy and expensive, and those who understand that are worth your time. ",
            "This is adorable :)",
            "You two sound incredibly sweet. Cheers for the happy update. I'm glad you went through with your plan.\n\nEven though you had a limited budget, it's clear that you put a lot of thought into your plan. Being thoughtful like that is the foundation for real romance, OP. She's going to adore the crap out of your watch because of the thoughtfulness you put into it and the memories of the lovely Valentine's day that go with it.",

What could you ever have to fear from someone else's *money?*\n\nNothing.",

            "I didn't read your first post, but I want to say you made her day amazing and you should feel like an amazing boyfriend.  A lot of people assume the girl only wants huge, expensive dinners/things on Vday, but just spending time with the person you love can be the best gift ever. ",
            "Congrats! You did exactly the right thing.\n\nAs someone who is in the position of your GF's Dad (middle aged, with two daughters and reasonably liquid) the greatest thing you can give your GF is attention and thought, not material goods. This is especially true when someone has been fortunate enough to grow up in a well off family.\n\nI've been with my wife 16 years. During that period I've gone from a struggling student to a successful business exec and the things that she appreciates the most are the small things: home cooked dinners, hand made cards, flowers from the garden and the like. Don't get me wrong, she loves an occasional grand gesture (especially shoes and handbags!) but she would be incredibly angry with me if I bought something that I (more correctly we) could not afford because I thought it was expected by society. She love things that show that I have thought about what she wants and that's it.\n\nIt works both ways too. The best gift she's ever given me was a coffee mug with our daughters' hand prints on it. I fucking love that mug and it could not have cost more than 20 bucks but it's one of the first things I would pull out of a house fire.\n\nCheap does not mean worthless and expensive does not mean valuable. This is something that many people learn too late and it looks like you've got it correct right out of the gate.",
            "Haha, it's so hard to get a reservation in Seattle on Vday.  I just usually cook dinner at home.  Though we did go out to Bramling Cross and sat at the bar fine.",

            "This is a nice story, happy things are going well.  But this seems crazy to me.  Why are you so stressed out about potentially spending $500 when all she got for you were some cookies and a coloring book?  Like, either stop worrying about this kind of thing, stop spending money when you should be spending time.  There's no way you can ever compete with her family money, so thoughtful counts.  Try custom etsy gifts in the future!  Good luck.",
            "That's awesome!  Sounds like you have a keeper, don't mess it up :)  \n\nYou delivered what she wanted:  a day where she can be \"her\" and not have to fake things for her family.  I'm guessing that's why she cares for you...I'm guessing you don't look at her as some \"rich girl\" or judge her for being one and you're down to earth and real and she wants that.",

I appreciate and love both gifts. The eggs just got a stronger reaction even though they were basically free. It doesn't matter the price point.

It's not the size of the gift, it's how you give it. ;)",

Right now they\u2019re main focus is me and my girlfriend, of 4 months. They barrage me all day with texts and phone calls about how this woman isn\u2019t right for me, flaws they see in her, advising me to break up, on and on. It\u2019s weird, whenever any of them dated a guy, I never said anything, but, whenever I date, oh my god, stop the presses.\n\nIn the past, as it relates to their \u201c advice\u201d, I\u2019ve tried an \u201c I can handle myself, thanks though\u201d approach, they don\u2019t listen. I\u2019ve tried, \u201c stfu and go away\u201d, they get offended and but continue advising.\n\nThey hate this woman(23F) I\u2019m with now. Personally, I\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve ever been in a relationship. She\u2019s more outgoing and talkative than women I\u2019ve dated in the past, very pretty, very bubbly, very fun. They think she\u2019s shallow, unintelligent, and image-obsessed, and I rebuke these claims all the time with them.\n\nI just want them to stop with the snide remarks and insults. When I try and stop it, whether it\u2019s in a text thread or call or video chat or whatever, someone\u2019s quick to remind me of the \u201cpecking order\u201d and told that \u201cthey have my best interests in mind\u201d and want to see me with the \u201c right girl\u201d aka one they approve of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: How can I get my older sisters to accept who I'm dating?",

            "I'm going to give you a \"Dear Abby\" kind of answer:\n\nYou don't have to listen to this at all and the solution is to tell your sisters you don't want to hear it. Whenever they start sending you texts, ignore and delete them. Whenever they call, the moment they start digging into your GF, tell them, \"I said I won't listen to this. Thanks for calling.\" and hang up the phone.\n\nIf you're in their presence and they start this, tell them, \"I told you I won't listen to this.\" and leave the room. If they persist, leave the house.\n\nThis becomes a lather, rinse, repeat, until they finally get the message. If they won't stop, no matter what you do, tell them you'll break all contact with them if it continues, and mean it. They'll get the message the more you do it.\n\nAnd if you have to make the hard choice to cut them off, hopefully, they'll realize they're pushing you away and apologize.\n\nI just can't get over how much they're bombarding you with this. It's almost pathological. I wouldn't even call it protective. It's just plain nuts.",
            "Do you live with them? If not just block them until they learn to keep their opinions to themselves.",
            "Tell them that every time they say anything about your girlfriend, you put a dollar in a jar. That's currently your engagement ring fund.",
            "I sent my oldest sister a text, she is engaged, laid out my boundaries, basically that the more they bring her up, the quicker they're going to lose me, said that their problems are their problems. I'm old enough to handle my own stuff, and that their comments are rude, their advice is unwanted. Threw in \" what if I said rude things about your guy?\"\n\nPer her response, I'm spoiled, rude, ungrateful, I'm betraying my family, and that the comparison between her man & my girlfriend isn't accurate because, her man has \" actually done things in life\"",
            "Hello sisters,\n\nI am sending you a message to formally ask you to keep yourself out of my private life. I am a grown man and I am capable of making my own decisions. Your problems with GF are just that, YOUR PROBLEMS. You are older and I understand that you think you know what is best for me. You do not. Full stop. It is time to let me make my own choices and decisions, and I am NOT open to your advice when it comes to my love life. I would however like to thank you. Your constant attacks on GF, and my constant need to defend her, have helped to highlight all of the things that I appreciate about her. \n\nMoving forward I am not interested in your advice and any further attempts to force it on me will result in you being blocked until you can respect that I am an adult my life decisions are MINE to make. \n\nI love you all, but I have had enough. I am not open to discussion about this effective immediately. If you cannot respect my right to be an independent adult then we have nothing to discuss.\n\nOP\n\nEdit to fix: spelling",
            "Short answer is that you won\u2019t be able to get your sisters to accept who you are dating.\n\nYour sisters are not reasonable rational people and you cannot interact with them like they will respond to you kindly.  They have told you they are on top of the pecking order and you are the bottom and must obey.  They have essentially told you that they \u201clove\u201d you so much they must abuse you.\n\nThe only way to deal with people like this is boundaries and consequences.  You have told your sisters to stop commenting on your relationship with girlfriend.  Now you need to enact consequences when they do not comply. \nStop responding to your sisters when they start commenting on your relationship.  Do not respond at all to any negative comments other than \u201cl will not discuss this with you.  If you continue I will not have contact with you for 2 weeks.\u201d  Every time they bring up girlfriend you cut contact, after the first time and they still do not stop abusing you then you increase the time out to 4 weeks.  Then double it again if needed.\n\nSame for any video call or in person visit.  The moment they start with comments you tell them to stop.  If they do not you leave and put them in a time out.\n\nI am sorry your sisters try to control your life.  They don\u2019t actually care for you, they just want to control you.  If they actually thought you were in a bad relationship they would have never brought up the \u201cpecking order\u201d.  They gave themselves away by saying that to you.",
            "Block them on social media and have you Gf do it too. They need to go on a information diet until they learn how to behave. Tell them that as well.",
            "A lot of people are pretty passive that\u2019s how you should handle it, I\u2019m a little more assertive honestly. My sisters tried this I made sure to tell them to shut the fuck up and mind your fucking business, I would tell them every time you start commenting on my girlfriend or my relationship I\u2019m going to do the same to yours and I\u2019m not going to be as nice. It took About a week, but after hammering them hard about their insecurities they stopped\n\nI got a feeling they\u2019re jealous of how she looks, that\u2019s usually the first time your sisters comment and if they are still stuck on how she looks it\u2019s definitely out of jealousy. Maybe start focusing on that aspect.",
            "You\u2019ve stated your boundary, but you\u2019re not enforcing it. The next time one of them starts on about your girlfriend, state, \u201cI will not tolerate anyone insulting my girlfriend. Change the subject, or I\u2019m out.\u201d If/when they continue badmouthing your girlfriend, you leave. Whether that means walking away, driving away, hanging up, disconnecting, or just putting your phone down. Leave the conversation every single time they start again. No exceptions. You need to send a crystal clear and consistent message that you absolutely will not put up with their behavior.",

            "Like others have said, set boundaries.  Just send them an automated neutral message, \"Thank you for your concern but it is inappropriate to be commenting on my dating life.  Thank you for respecting my boundaries\", and ignore any messages after that related to your dating life.  Don't engage and don't feel like you have to explain yourself.  That statement alone is enough.\n\n> I rebuke these claims all the time with them. \n\nDon't argue.  Just respond with the message about boundaries.\n\n>  remind me of the \u201cpecking order\u201d \n\nThis is stupid, but don't argue against the pecking order, just ignore them after the boundaries message because there is no pecking order in your life.  It's just you making your own decisions, and they need to respect that.",

My buddy has \"big\" family members, and his sisters used to talk shit about his gf for being very fit and physically attractive. She was also quite smart and humble, very kind, but they kept saying he's an adult and should be dating \"women\", not \"little girls\". They were very cold to her when they'd visit.\n\nJust laugh them off and ignore them. Don't let it get to you, they crave the \"power\" to affect your life. \"Yeah, nah\" is a good one. \"Lol you aren't going to change my mind\". If you treat them like they aren't even worth the effort to text they'll eventually get it. If not then you still get to ignore them. These are toxic people and have no business giving advice.",

One time his mom went so far as to call me a prostitute.\n\nListen, I wished... WISHED my ex had been man enough to stand up for me or just put an end to it all but he never did. \n\nFor your girlfriends sake, tell them next time you won\u2019t be speaking to them. Even if it\u2019s just for a few days! Make them understand they don\u2019t have the right! Bc if your gf doesn\u2019t know yet, she will eventually.",

            "You can't control what they do, but you can control how you respond. If they text you about her, don't respond.

She's my family, and if you can't accept it then you're no longer my family.\"\n\nI don't know what the future holds for you and this girl. But you need to stand up to your family.

It's not just this girlfriend, it's your whole life. It's not about getting them to accept her, it's about being confident in your ability to make good decisions for your life.

            "Strangely enough this is actually something I can personally give you advice on. I'm ALSO the youngest and only male in the family with ALSO 3 older sisters. I also had this problem for a while as not only my sisters but my parents weren't accepting on who I was dating and got constant remarks and even online stalking of my girlfriend. Here is how I solved it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow before I start. I want you to understand that later in life if you really want to take your relationship seriously is that your girlfriend will be beside you and know you better than your sisters do/will. My tactic took me many years, but the way I did it was by proving my Independence. At 24 I took a job in Alaska and left my home behind. I basically forced myself away from the family, after me leaving and disconnecting they started to see me on a different light. After I have returned I found out that my family APPROACHED my girlfriend for a way of talking to me while I was gone. A few months later I moved out and a year after I brought her in to move in with me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe way I solved it was by focusing more on my relationship and my self independence over the family. They started to understand that I wasn't going to dump my girlfriend and that I was actually happy with her. It did take time, and yes it was very awkward but in the end they understood that I was happy with her. They also started to understand that I'm okay with not speaking to them or even caring much about the family and to keep me around they actually started to speak to me, and once I heard anything negative, I just would hang up the call or \"nope\" out of the conversation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, stay with your girlfriend. No matter what they say even if they accept her or not. Stay with her and maybe they will come around but even if they don't it won't matter as you will still be with your girlfriend. Good luck out there",
            "Your sisters are very opinionated and need to actually mind their own business. It is you dating your girlfriend, not the other way around. They honestly sound controlling and don\u2019t care of your well being if they didn\u2019t say the \u201cpecking order\u201d. Like all the qualities I\u2019ve read of what you have mention in the comments, doesn\u2019t make her any different than any one thats okay. You don\u2019t go around judging their boyfriends/fianc\u00e9s/husbands, so why should they! \n\nBut definitely think about distancing yourself from them for a while. They need to learn that it\u2019s your life not theirs. Also if they cared about you as they say they do, they would actually try to get know her instead of full on judging her and try to see what you see in her. But also, I say just take into consideration, look into why your sisters are pointing out these things about your girlfriend. I hate to say it but sometimes sisters have a weird tuition of things not seeming right.",
            "Think all the advice re shutting them down every single time they try is good, but also letting them know how hurtful and rude it is also. Tell them it\u2019s bullying, it\u2019s disrespectful, it\u2019s nosy and it makes you not want to have any sort of relationship with them if they continue to butt into your life. Let alone how shitty it must make her feel. Say that and then continue to say \u201cI\u2019m not talking about this and hang up\u201d or not reply to messages etc. \n\nI see you say in another comment your dad likes her but your mom is more on the sisters side. I think you need to get your dad involved and try bring your mom around, as she\u2019s obviously not as crazy as your sisters and knows her boundaries. They can have rules like no talking about GF when in their house etc, or something to ease the burden on you. It will be good to have them in your corner, they are a bit more removed and must know how intrusive the behaviour is",

Some families sort of designate a member to be the spare tire; useful when necessary but needing to be secured away otherwise. It sounds like that might be your place. It took me more than half a lifetime to recognize that in myself. Believe me, it is not a good road to go down.\n\nWhat if you took two weeks and didn't talk to them? Two weeks isn't that long, but it will give you a sense of how they really are. Do they calm down? Do they go sulk? Do they go into Crazy JustNoMode?

            "there are two possible answers here 1) they are right; 2) they are jealous/misinformed/biased.  Either way you should do 3 things  1) listen but distance yourself- see what insights they have and then take their insights and make an attempt to follow through to see if their criticisms have any merit; 2) get to know her friends and family if she is of high moral character that is really important; 3) use protection if things have progressed to that level.\n\nDon't get caught in a situation that you cant handle when you are 23.\n\n  Too many people want to jump to the LOVE CONQUERS ALL screw your family conclusion.

            "OP, after having sifted through majority of the comments, I want to give you an alternative point of view as I've been in a similar position. If your older sisters see that you are totally blocking them out, they will persist even more so because they will assume you are being blindly stubborn. Instead, of telling them you will not listen to them, tell them to provide straight to the point reasoning for 'why she's not good for you', ask them to be concise and bring up exact examples of what she may have done or they saw in her, and why their opinion is such. Let them know that if their opinions are valid, you will take it into consideration as a potential yellow or red flag; however, if their opinions are not grounded in actual events and are just 'vibes', you have no interest in entertaining them and you will stop listening all together.\n\nI think this let's your sisters know \"I hear you, but I'm my own person with my own opinions and will do what I think is right in the end\"\n\nEdit: spelling",
            "TLDR: Maybe include some specific examples on what they say, this presents as \"my sisters don't like my girlfriend because reasons\". It lends the appearance of immaturity on both sides. Talk with your sisters, find out why they have these opinions, and if they truly are invalid seek resolutions and be prepared to accept that their opinions will never change.     \n\n\nI feel like specific examples need to be included in this, while i'm not certain what type of people your siblings are as the eldest sibling of my family I relate to their view points more without any sort of examples. I understand the urge to protect the younger siblings even if they are adults who can make their own choices. The question becomes why do they think she's shallow, unintelligent and image obsessed? Do they see how she treats you and think that she should treat you better?   \n\n\nI know that when you'r in a relationship somethings become normal and you don't question it. A red flag through rose colored lenses are just flags. Im not trying to say that you're stupid or that your blatantly ignoring red flags or that she is giving any. Im just trying to relate to your siblings point of view as well as your own.   \n\n\nIt's been my experience that people tend to present the story that best frames themselves as in the right and maybe examining your sisters reasons for not liking this woman can reveal the root of the problem.   \n\n\nMaybe your sisters are jealous, over protective, or just mean. But have they done this kind of thing before? Do you trust that they only have your best interests at heart?   \n\n\nIn the end a serious discussion is needed, maybe some group therapy, boundaries and consequences but in the end it may not change anything. All you can do is try.  \n\n\nand speaking as someone with estranged family, its not worth estranging your family for a relationship that hasn't even lasted half a year yet. Unless your sisters are truly toxic id advise that you try to maintain the relationship.",

They may be your family, but they don't get to dictate what you can and can't do. \n\nIt sounds like they're psychologically projecting onto all the women in your life.

Be very clear: \"if you bring up your opinion about my girlfriend, I will hang up the phone,\" or whatever sounds right to you. Use very short, declarative sentences. Don't include feelings or weasel words, just: \"I will no longer put up with your bullshit.\" But, because you love your sisters and want a relationship with them, make it a \"sandwich:\" first the good  - \"you're my sisters, I love you, I know you want the best for me\" - then the boundaries - \"I will no longer put up with your constant criticism of my girlfriend, this is not negotiable\" - and then another love fest - \"please understand that I will always love you, and love you for your concern.\" \n\nDo it over email so that you can't get sidetracked by them. \n\n2. Behave accordingly. \n\nIf they violate the terms you've set out, carry through on the consequences. Hang up the phone. Leave the house.

            "I\u2019m late to this so this comment will probably get buried but here goes. In my personal experience (noting I have no qualifications other than dealing with extremely difficult and complicated family myself) when family members behave like this it\u2019s because they are comfortable loving you as they imagine you to be. It\u2019s a possessive/conditional type of \u201clove\u201d which is dependant on you maintaining your place in the pecking order/persona. Once you step out of the box they\u2019ve put you in there can be a severe reaction. Like when the family fuckup gets their life together, there can be a severe negative reaction - the other family members are comfortable relating to that person as the fuckup. But an independent, responsible adult?? The same thing happens in friendship groups - think when the \u201cugly friend\u201d gets attractive. It changes the dynamic. It sounds like you - for whatever reason - have been designated \u201cleast intelligent\u201d of your family, and just speculating here, your other family members have taken this as license to give you advice and play an important role in your life and relationships. There\u2019s also the fact that you are only 23 and having caring, interested and engaged older sisters than you probably has been useful in many respects. Even unsolicited advice can be helpful! \n\nBut you\u2019re an adult now and you\u2019re dating a woman you click with who really makes you happy. IMHO you REALLY need to put your foot down with this. This is one of those make it or break it moments. Whatever happens with your girlfriend, this has got to be your decision, and even if she is wrong for you or whatever (though from the sounds of things I\u2019d doubt it), this is your mistake to make.\n\nI think you need to be very clear with your sisters that if they keep on trying to interfere, it is going to materially damage your relationship with them, possibly permanently. If push comes to shove, and a choice has to be made, I think you need to make clear that you would choose girlfriend over sisters. (It\u2019s not even really choosing your girlfriend- it\u2019s choosing your independence and right to make your own decisions without being browbeaten). But you need to stand your ground here- this is probably going to set the pattern for how your sisters interact with your girlfriends/wife going forward. \n\nSincerely, good luck! This is going to be very difficult and it\u2019s probably going to hurt your sisters and there will be backlash but you need to set these boundaries now or it\u2019s not going to happen. It can feel like a personal rejection to overly involved  family members when as you grow up, you start to make choices which aren\u2019t aligned with what they value -  and maybe it is in a way! You have found someone to love who is very different from your sisters and they probably experience that - rightly or wrongly - as a personal rejection. It\u2019s part of growing up! And either you stand firm or you give in and live the life your sisters think you should rather than the one you want. \n\nAlso from personal experience with the constant calls thing - when that happens, text back and say sorry I can\u2019t talk right now, will call back at 6.30pm if that\u2019s convenient and then do it. And then keep the call shortish- 15 minutes is good. If there is a genuine emergency- e.g someone\u2019s in hospital they will be able to let you know by text. But unless there is a GENUINE emergency you do not need to be returning calls immediately. I realise it will feel very strange initially, both for you and them, but it will get easier for you and they will get used to it. Also if they try to discuss your girlfriend with you, I would just say sorry I\u2019m not discussing (gf\u2019s name) with you and if they keep pushing it say I\u2019m going to end this call and do it. They\u2019ll get the message eventually. Good luck! You\u2019re going to need it.",

Call it a \u201cwoman\u2019s sixth sense\u201d. \nThey want the best for you. They want the perfect woman for you. They want you not to be hurt in life. \nMy approach to your issue would be to sit them all down (or THE one of them -you know which one I mean - the leader) and make her see you understand her fully, thank her for looking after you and express her how much that means to you.  But from the heart bro, with love. Listen to her reasoning about your gf and go deep into it, get to the bottom of each one of their points (dude, you might see truth in some of those points and it might help you avoid a heartache or at least help you reshape the relationship with your Gf for the better). \nOnce she got it all out -you heard it all with total disposition- leave the convo there. Give it a thought. Come back to her one or two days later and either say: you are right thank you for showing me what I didn\u2019t see or, lovingly send her to fuck off and ask her to let you make your own mistakes in life and be hurt because that is your due process to grow up and build up character for the day you truly need to put a ring on it on whomever the fuck you feel suits your dick and mind the best. \nI think this is a win win for all.",

            "I\u2019m sorry to have to tell you this, but if I was with a man whose family behaved this way toward me and he didn\u2019t put his foot down in a way that made it stop, I would leave him in a heartbeat. There is only so much space a woman will allow for the family of the man she wants to be with to be abusive toward her or to him before she is fully aware that they are both going to be abused for the remainder of their time together because he doesn\u2019t have the balls to stick up for either of them. When you are old enough to choose a partner for yourself, that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re doing, is choosing them, and that means setting firm boundaries and actually cutting people out if they continue to disrespect your partner. If you don\u2019t get a handle on this situation she\u2019s going to tell you to go fuck your self. No relationship is worth being disrespected indefinitely. My husbands father is a hateful, unstable nightmare. He blew up one time in my home and he hasn\u2019t been allowed back. He does not see us and we do not speak, and if my husband had not chosen to defend me over the man who was calling me names, he would have never been my husband, I don\u2019t care what their relationship is. Four months is long enough to sit in your partners family home while his sisters refuse to speak to you and snicker and call you names behind your back. If she\u2019s as confident and amazing as you say she is, then she knows her own worth and I\u2019m shocked she hasn\u2019t already walked. She will soon. Stop responding. Stop answering the phone. Stop calling back. You can either choose to let your shitty abusive family get pissed off because you very rightly backed up the woman you say you love and quit allowing them to bully you both, or you can listen to them say they told you so when your girl hits the end of her rope with this bullshit and gets tired of the fact that you\u2019re disrespecting her yourself by allowing it to continue.

If she's really not what they think she is, let them get to know her. Invite her to your family functions. I'm curious how well they even know her given that you have been dating for *4 months*. \n\nHow much of what they know about her is what you have told them/social media stalking vs actually meeting her? If you're really into her, then bring her around and show that you're serious. And make sure you openly stand up for your girlfriend if they say anything slick so that she always feels supported when she's around your family and holds her head high. If they still don't like her, that's fine. They don't have to like her.\n\nBut remember that they are your sisters who you grew up with and clearly have a close enough relationship with to talk about your love life with. They are older than you and have more life experience. They are biased, you're the baby brother, and they grew up imagining what your life would be. So just take their \"advice\" with a grain of salt, and try to change the subject, and if you really think this relationship is so great, prove it to them by bringing your girl around them.",

I seriously doubt this is the only subject that they do this with. \n\nWhen you tell someone to stop doing something, multiple times even, and they just completely ignore you and keep going, that is not okay. Your current relationship with your sisters is not healthy, and both you and they need to realize that. Now you can try telling them this, but judging by what you've told about them they'll probably just brush this off to.\n\nThis might sound extreme, but what seems most effective with people don't respect you or your boundaries, particularly with family members, is clearly stating your boundaries and cutting them out of your life until they respect them. You do not own it to anyone to put up with this kind of stuff \"just because they're your family\". You choose who you let into your life and what you put up with. That goes for them same as everyone else. \n\nAnd you really need to stand your ground with this if you do decide to cut them out for a while. Don't text them, don't call them, don't answer the door for them etc. When you do this, most people quickly get a wake-up that they need to change what they're doing.

At 4 am.\n\nFortunately my sibling's car had a CB radio (pre-cellphone days), and we were able to reconnect and picked him up at a truck stop--truckers are awesome, just saying.\n\nThe long and short of it was that I would have broken up with him in a few more months if she'd kept her mouth shut.

This need to be overprotective is something that tends to happen when there's a unbalanced gender ratio (you're the only boy out of 4 kids) so rather than pick at each other they unite together and become hyper focused on you. Part of it is because whoever you end up with is going to potentially become apart of their 'crew' someday. On Holidays and family meetups what usually happens is that the men stick together and the women assemble etc. So i think they're trying to cherry pick the best girl for THEM. \n\nI think it's also because they're used to seeing you as the 'baby' of the family. Whenever they give you their opinion on your gf try saying, \"i appreciate you looking out for me sister and i know you put alot of thought into this but I'm an adult now.

Then block them for a couple of weeks.\n\nTrust me, there is nothing else to be done other than blocking. Everyone who ever had this kind of extreme problem with family members that want to control your life always tries reasoning, pleading, arguing, crying, threatening - NOTHING works until they see that you're serious about cutting contact.

Her and her husband are one of those people that have a ton of adopted kids (eight so far) and are super religious. To each his own. Mary enjoys telling everyone at work her business, so when she decided to adopt a kid from the Ukraine, everyone heard about it. She went with an older kid because it was easier for her and her husband (she says). This was two years ago.\n\nMary has asked me to babysit the boy a couple of times (I'll call him Tony), and it's never been a problem because I like kids. I didn't see any glaring problems despite Mary's constant dramatics about how awful the kid was and he seemed to like being over (it's just me and my boyfriend here, and our place is small but clean and really well kept. Mary's house is...disgusting for lack of a better word). Mary would harp constantly about how much Tony liked it at our house but I just chalked it up to the kid having a good time.\n\nLately Mary has been at work, talking to anyone that'll listen about how awful Tony is, how horrible he is to the other kids, and how she's going to get rid of him. She sent out a freaking mass email to everyone in our department asking if someone wanted to take her kid from her. She calls it \"re-homing\" and that its okay. I logged onto Facebook today and same story...she has pics of Tony posted to her timeline advertising him for re-adoption and to contact her if interested!! \n\nI haven't replied to her email yet, and I haven't commented on her post but I'm this close to ripping into her for what she's doing. She's crossed the line from weird into full blown psycho. Should I call CPS? The police? I don't know much about adoption and a quick search for rehoming gets me mostly results about animals. Any advice?\n\n   \n**tl;dr** Crazy coworker is trying to pawn her kid off to strangers in the office or on the Internet. She claims it's legal. What should I do?\n\nEDIT: Shit has hit the fan.

Thank you all for the thoughtful and compassionate responses.**\n\nBackstory: I (32F) have been with fiance (34M) for several years. I've been in therapy since 21. I am admittedly a \"work in progress\" as I always will be, though I would like to think that I try as hard as I can and have developed some strategies to utilizes when things seem to be spiraling. This has allowed me to have a stable home life, relationship turned engagement, and I've always been able to hold down a decent job.\n\nMy fiance does not have mental health issues, but often acknowledges that he wishes he was in therapy to deal with how he handles frustration and crisis situations. He has insurance, but can't seem to find the time to make an appointment for himself. He respects and is proud of me for going to therapy myself and when I become extremely anxious about situations (even about things related to our communication) he encourages me to talk about it (but not in a diminishing or gaslighting way).\n\nPrior to COVID, I (like most others) went to see a therapist in-person. Now it happens virtually, and I actually find it more effective for some reason. When I talk about really difficult subjects I'm processing, I tend to raise my voice and cry. Fiance and I live in a small apartment and it has happened so far that he has been out of the house during my sessions, so this issue hasn't yet come up.\n\nToday, fiance unexpectedly came home for lunch in the middle of a session. I knew that he'd come back at some point but wasn't sure exactly when. While on the phone w therapist, I was pretty viscerally upset and going off about some deeply-rooted, abuse related issues about family and ex. Fiance got home and walked towards my room to say hi and opened the door. He walked on me me speaking about something in abstract, and quickly left the room. He went into the living room and put on a podcast, maybe in an effort for me not to be worried that he was eavesdropping. So I figured he wasnt listening and continued to vent (about past resentment). Then But then I heard some shuffling outside my door in the hallway and when he coughed accidentally, it made clear how close he was. It was a super awkward situation all around and I'm not sure how I should have handled it.\n\nHe then left the apartment and I'm not sure if I upset him. I'm also wondering if I messed up by not warning him in the morning that I would be in an appointment later. I had a million other work related things to do today on the forefront of my mind. I texted him that I'm sorry I missed him, and no response for an hour.  If I did in fact upset him, not sure how/if to apologize, so any advice would be appreciated.\n\ntldr; fiance came home unexpectedly, most likely overheard me venting about serious issues unrelated to him, left abruptly and I'm afraid I upset him",

            "Why do you think you may have upset him? Your fiance knows you've went to therapy for years, regularly. He obviously realised you were in a session when he walked in. I don't think you did anything you need to apologize for, or anything that would've hurt your fiance.",
            "If it were me,  I may have coughed on purpose so that you knew I'd be walking near the room in case you wanted to keep what you're saying private from me. That was my first thought since he also turned on the podcast, possibly to assure you that he wasn't overhearing you. Definitely speak to him about it when he comes home though, and I hope whatever he has to say will ease your mind.",
            "**UPDATE:** \n\nSo as many of you speculated, I was being overly anxious. I didn't hear from fiance for awhile, but it turned out that he was busy. After coming home, everything seemed to be fine. He then asked how my day was, and I just blurted out what I outlined in the OP. I told him that when he got home I was in the middle of a therapist appointment. He said he figured that out pretty quickly after he first saw me, left the room and put on the podcast while making lunch in hopes that I wouldn't feel self conscious for the rest of the appt. I mentioned that I heard him in close proximity the room at one point and felt a little anxious that he may have heard something that upset him. He said that he did go to the bathroom (closer to the room I was in) and that he could hear me, but any words were inaudible. \n\nThe bottom line is that he wasn't upset, if anything, a momentary tinge of awkwardness. He said that he feels positive that I care enough about myself to try to work things out in therapy. From now on, he knows when my appointments are so will try to make himself scarce during these 40 minutes for my own peace of mind. \n\nOne thing I do want to address is that I have not been seeing one therapist for 10 years. In fact, I've seen a few, due to relocation, changes in employment/insurance coverage, and in one case it was a bad fit. It's not uncommon for people to change primary care doctors over the course of a decade and this isn't much different. As to why I posted on Reddit afterward: I was curious about what people thought. It's not abnormal to want insight from people in a non-professional setting. \n\nAs far as therapy not working because I've been going for a decade, and those who think my talking about ex means I'm not over him: the damage incurred by PTSD (in my case via physical/emotional)v abuse is something that will never be entirely \"fixable\" and I don't really know what to say to anyone who tries to argue otherwise.",
            "[deleted]",
            "I\u2019m exactly the same in therapy. I think it\u2019s normal and absolutely nothing to apologize for. Try not to jump to a conclusion about how your boyfriend felt or why he was acting that way. It sounds like you generally communicate well so just talk it through and figure out what happened.",
            "Being with someone for several years and your 30s I would hope you two have worked out a way to communicate with compassion and understanding.  If not then I would suggest that you two take a couple of classes or have a couple of sessions around that skill.",
            "Is it possible that he came to the door to say goodbye before heading back to work, heard you were still with your therapist, and decided to head out without interrupting? I know I've done that before.  Not really eavesdropping, just hesitating before knocking or barging in on someone, then realizing that they're busy, so deciding not to interrupt. \n\nOn the other hand, if he was deliberately listening in on your therapy, that's deeply uncouth so I hope he wasn't doing that.\n\nObviously, the best way to know what he overheard and how he feels is to talk to him, and to maybe offer some sort of context if he happened to accidentally overhear something that needs that background.",
            "Sounds to me like he tried to give you your privacy after he realized you were on a call, realized that the podcast wasn't cutting it, and left to make sure you had your space. Is the bathroom on the same hallway as where you were doing your call? He wasn't necessarily listening in, he might have just been walking by. \n\nMy advice is to not wind yourself up about this and talk to him when he gets home. It doesn't need to be a big deal conversation. There's every chance he was just trying to be considerate.",
            "this sounds like your anxiety more than anything, but you should communicate",
            "I'm doing therapy from home, too. Hiding while a partner is there is really uncomfortable. I think there's a chance he's embarrassed. He saw you in a way I'm assuming he hasn't before. It might take some time to figure out how to talk about it. Especially if he's not had much experience with therapy. Good luck.",
            "Is it possible he was just passing by the door and literally either just 1. Had a cough and it wasn't an accident bc he wasn't trying to eavesdrop or 2. Intentionally coughed to indicate he was close to the door and could hear you in case you wanted privacy. Honestly you kind of sound like you're expecting him to be upset and projecting that onto him",
            "Could be nothing the answer will be there when he comes back",
            "My husband sometimes has a hard time hearing about my past, it upsets him, not because he\u2019s upset with me, but because it hurts him to think about me being harmed. \n\nMaybe he\u2019s processing what he heard and he\u2019s upset, but not *at you*.\n\nDoes that makes sense?",
            "\"That was a little awkward.  Next time do you want me to warn you if I have a session?\"\n\nThen let it go.\n\nThere's nothing here that warrants a major apology.",
            "So just checking... he came home for lunch, and then left again, and you haven't talked to him since then? So... you don't actually know if he's upset?",
            "Why not talk to him about this instead of reddit?",
            "Why not just... talk to him? Literally all people here can do is speculate. Like, \u201cI noticed you left kind of abruptly. Was anything up with that?\u201d",
            "Just talk to him. Honestly, I don't think anything bad happened here, but I do understand it makes you anxious. That's how anxiety works. At least for me it works that way. And his lack of immediate response causes this snowball. Stop and breathe and try to be positive. And talk to your partner. Everything is gonna be fine.",
            "As someone who also suffers from anxiety, your line of thinking is exactly what I do too. I worry about all the little tiny signs that *might* mean something is up and freak out about it for hours before confronting the situation. Just ask yourself what the worst case scenario is: he is upset about something he heard. If so, I\u2019m sure you guys can discuss it and work through it together. It\u2019s never the actual outcome that is the end of the world, it\u2019s your anxiety and fear of the confrontation and possible problem that are messing with you! Best of luck in talking about this, hopefully it is just a misunderstanding!",

But then I heard some shuffling outside my door in the hallway and when he coughed accidentally, it made clear how close he was.\n\nSo, uh... that kind of sounds like he *was* eavesdropping? He made it seem he was listening to something in the living room and couldn't hear you, then came to stand outside your door and you only knew he was there because he \"coughed accidentally\"?",
            "I think you're overthinking this, your fiance was probably trying to give you space, and there's absolutely no reason why he should be upset.",
            "There's really nothing that internet strangers can help you with until you talk to your fiance and find out what's going on.",
            "Don\u2019t worry today about what you can put off worrying about till tomorrow! Stop yourself now in the negative spiral of anxious thoughts. You don\u2019t have enough information. No amount of thinking will give you more information. Talk to him and get more information. Then you can deal with facts, not hypotheticals.",
            "So talk to him, ask him if he's bothered and ask him to be honest with you about it and you be honest with him. \n\nIt's really that simple.",
            "If my wife was yelling and crying to her therapist... Well, I'd assume it was something I did.\n\n\nShe's nice enough to reassure me that it isn't.\n\n\nMaybe he's worried that you're upset at him about something and you're not telling him about it. But *obviously* he can't ask you, because he only overheard something during your therapy session.",
            "He may be feeling bad for not being there for you or not able to share your frustration and pain. I think maybe you should tell him staff that is bothering you.",
            "Hello \ud83d\udc4b,  im new(er) to reddit. In this situation why not just ask him if he heard any thing and or was curious? This is worth posting on the internet? Hes probably sitting right next to you. My girlfriend loves reddit I guess it more of a sharing feelings anonymous thing online? Right.",
            "You don\u2019t apologize. That\u2019s a private session. If he is upset he should come talk to you about it. You can open a dialogue but don\u2019t apologize for processing your feelings in a healthy way with a professional.",
            "It's not about him, he has no reason to be upset, and if he *is*, he needs to consider *why* he's upset after eavesdropping on a private conversation.",
            "It sounds like your anxiety is getting the better of you in this situation. Remember not to mind read \u2014 it is never helpful! Talk to your fianc\u00e9 and go from there. \n\nOn another note, I have to say that it sounds like your therapy may not be terribly effective. I know that on Reddit we sort of normalize being in therapy for years and years, but there ARE treatments and providers who can help you with anxiety / trauma to the point that you can take breaks from therapy or be done altogether. These treatments are pretty different from what you\u2019re doing now \u2014 you almost definitely wouldn\u2019t spend years rehashing hard stuff from childhood. Of course, if your current treatment is what you\u2019re looking for, disregard this idea! But if you\u2019d like something more effective, consider looking into a CBT-focused therapist. There are other good options but a good CBT therapist should know about those as well and can help you!",

            "I haven't seen it but, you have nothing to apologize for. Please do not apologize for a therapy session that no one but you and your therapist is supposed to hear. If he did in fact continue listening that's a whole other thing and is not ok. If not and he is upset it isn't justified, talk to him but you shouldn't be feeling soguilty OP.",
            "If you are at all concerned about this happening in the future, then I\u2019d recommend starting a shared online family calendar with him, and putting your therapy appointments in there, so that if he happens to come home unexpectedly, he\u2019ll know not to interrupt during the session. (My husband and I do this with Apple\u2019s Calendar app for all of our medical appointments, but it was especially helpful when I was doing teletherapy.)",
            "He doesn't get to be upset if he was eavesdropping.",
            "Sounds like your making a mountain of a mole hill. Has he done anything to make you think he was upset? The facts are he came home for lunch, went to say hi to you, interrupted your therapy for a quick second, listened to a podcast, ate lunch, and coughed by the door. I mean given corona that we live in that cough can be allergies, the cold, COVID? I would definitely work on the anxiety and believe me I saw someone for mine. I\u2019m in a lot better mental state now that I can break down events to be like okay look at the facts only.",

            "We are in a new world for now. Discuss it with him. Tell him that you need this total privacy for your sessions. Try and schedule them for a time when he will not be home. But then make up a sign that says \u201cSession In Progress\u201d. Then put the sign on the front door every time you have a session. But remember to remove it when you are done.

            "Sounds to me like he was just trying to give you space and was being thoughtful! If he is upset you will find out and then you can ask him what he's upset about. Nothing you said sounds like something that might upset him so much he would refuse to answer you.",

If there's deep routed childhood issues that you haven't discussed with him (you absolutely do not need to) he might be upset that you had a hard time.\n\nWait until he comes back, sit down and ask him what's wrong. You can only go from there. But do not think you're to blame. He eavesdropped on a conversation that had nothing to do with him. He's in the wrong, not you.",
            "My ONLY thought as to why he could be even slightly upset, is that he came home during lunch expecting to spend time with you but you were in a session instead.

            "I still talk every fortnight to my doctor who l first saw in 1991. After working on the big stuff she acts as a supportive listening person. I have a major role as a carer and l have someone neutral who knows my situations and can provide support when needed. I don't think you ever get used to abuse and emotional distress. You can band aid but its a part of you now. I find the phone easier as l can't say somethings when l am sitting opposite someone. I am sure he understands you and is a good partner.

            "Gotta love a happy ending, and you and your fiance are the people that deserve one. I 100% understand being anxious that your partner is upset with you, especially when your ex was abusive. I struggle with the same thing. Abusive ex trained me to walk on eggshells. You are amazing for working hard to overcome your issues, and your fiance seems supportive. *hugs*",
            "So he listened into a private conversation he KNEW wasn\u2019t for his ears? Do not apologize. He went across a boundary of respect. You need to communicate and explain. It\u2019s up to him to want to hear.",

We are all works in progress. You have your struggles and you are invested in self improvement. At the end of the day, we are who we are, and we can only try to be better people. I'm proud of you for striving for self improvement - but please be careful not to pathologize yourself, as it can cause more damage in the long run.",
            "So say he doesn't have mental health issues but can't handle frustrating or crises and also the fact he stormed out rather staying and talking about the situation tells me he has mental issues. Sounds like anxiety which can turn into anger very quickly if extreme pressure is presented. Also no one needs therapy for life. With a good therapist they should be able to help you with providing mechanisms for the situations that require it. I can tell you before therapy I was like your husband and now after I can now go into any situation and handle it a hundred times better. It's not like the pressure goes away but the mechanisms that were taught to me help me handle the situations without anger.",
            "Maybe he left to give you some private space with your therapist. And anyway, why should he take *your* therapy sessions personally? You might wanna examine why you asume the worst before getting all information (is it from past experiences). Why should the first thought be that you\u2019ve upset him especially if you weren\u2019t speaking about him? He already knows you go to therapy and as you\u2019ve said, he\u2019s supportive of that. Another perspective: have there been other instances where you were doing something for yourself and he got upset (if it has nothing to do with him he shouldn\u2019t get mad). \n\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be upsetting to your partner that you choose to work through problems\u2014they should commend you on it. Do you maybe subconsciously think he actually looks down on you for going to therapy? Is that a projection or fact? The only way to find out is if you ask him: \u201chave I upset you? Why did you leave the apartment?\u201d\n\n\nSending good vibes~",

            "Therapy for 11 YEARS and no end in sight?\n\nReally?\n\nSomeone's been taking YOU and your insurance company for a financial ride and making a whole lot of money off of you for **far too long**.  Since when does it take 11 years and counting to deal with your issues?\n\nHonestly.  Go to someone else. This one isn't helping you at all.",
            "You're such a kind soul. You have such a beautiful heart. \n\nI wish you, and your fiancee, a life full of love, sharing, and satisfaction.\n\nYour fiancee definitely heard more than you realize, but since he hasn't freaked out, let alone SAID anything... I think it's fair to assume that he just wants you to do whatever it is that you think will aid you in your healing process. \n\nYou CAN apologize, and I think that it would bring you two SO CLOSE!! \n\nYou don't need to talk about what you were speaking to your therapist about.\n\nYou don't even need to apologize at all, but if you feel you want to, it'd do nothing but bring more positivity into your relationship.\n\nYou don't realize how awesome you are. Yet. Keep going!",
            "Was probably just concerned about you and wants to know what your issues are at a more intimate level.\n\nThis is absolutely the wrong way to handle it and a violation of your privacy. He was likely in the wrong (unless he was leaving the bathroom or something before he had to head off to work). But it probably wasn't anything intended to be bad and he's likely not angry. That said, you need to have a serious talk about boundaries with him.",
            "If I was him I\u2019d be ashamed that I had so shamefully and obviously violated the trust of my spouse by eavesdropping on their therapy session. I don\u2019t see anywhere where you would have upset him unless you were speaking on important things he did not know about.",
            "If you're going on therapy for 10 years it clearly doesn't work and you're wasting money.",
            "You have nothing to apologize for.  He owes you an apology for eavesdropping.",
            "Upset him?  He was eavesdropping on personal information and he KNEW that you were in therapy at the time.  What he did was a HUGE breach of trust!",
            "11 years of therapy? Wow.",
            "Why are you worried about how HE feels?\nHE violates YOUR privacy and eavesdropped during your THERAPY SESSION. This is so so so wrong!!!! Do NOT apologize for anything!! \nAlso, the \u201che can\u2019t find time to make a therapy appointment\u201d is complete bullshit.",

            "Tell him that in a relationship resentment can build up and even though it sounded like you were telling therapist about how awful he was, you were actually clearing that resentment so that it can no longer pollute the relationship."
