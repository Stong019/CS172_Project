        "selftext": "Been with Stephanie (name changed for privacy) for a little over 3 years. More or less relationship is good, she tends to be way overdramatic when we fight (which isn't often) but I can usually talk her down and things work out. \n\nWhen Stephanie and I first started dating she mentioned a few times in kind of a mysterious (I thought it was attention-seeking, still do) way that she had some kind of mental illness or mental health struggle. Eventually (probably two or three months in) she came out and told me in a really serious conversation that she has body dysmorphia and thinks she's obese and hates herself for it. \n\nNow let me be clear, I love her the way she is, wouldn't change a thing, I don't mind her weight whatsoever. But even when she said it initially, I almost thought it was a joke. Stephanie is obese. I'm not good at guessing weight and she's never told me her weight, but I know she's 5'4 and a size 22 in pants (US). She's by all standards obese. I don't mind it at all. I'm attracted to her, I think she's beautiful, I would never ask her to change a thing.\n\nIt didn't come up again for a while but last fall she took a psychology course for her college degree and they talked about mental illness and it came back up. She came in one night almost happy? in a weird way, saying that she understands everything that's wrong with her because they talked about BD in class and it all makes sense. She has never been diagnosed by a medical professional and can't see a doctor for lack of health insurance. \n\nEver since then, she talks about it a lot. I'm not one to poke at people just to poke, so I just let it be. But she talks about it all the time. She blames arguments we have on her BD. She uses it as an excuse to eat poorly and not take care of herself, because she is straight up convinced that she is smaller than she is and that the person she sees in the mirror is a dysmorphic situation. She is part of an online BD support group and talks openly to me about how she's met people who finally understand her, and she gives them advice and guidance based on her \"struggle\" with BD. She's pointed to actresses like Mindy Kalling and compared the actress's body to her \"actual\" body (vs. BD body) and says it's nice to see herself represented on screen. No offense intended to my girlfriend, but that's not her body type. She is much bigger than that.\n\nI'm getting to the point where I don't know what to do. She uses it as an excuse for all her behavior. I honestly don't know if she truly thinks she has BD or if she just uses it to justify herself. When we first moved in together, she would cover all the sizes on the tags of her clothes with Sharpie so I wouldn't see them. She's since stopped doing that (or only does it when she remembers), but it made me think she might be aware of her size and just tries to pretend she has BD so no one can talk to her about it.\n\nI know this is a weird situation. I'd like to get her or us into counseling but she doesn't have insurance and goes to a community college that doesn't offer student mental health services. I'm not sure what to do. \n\nTL;DR Girlfriend uses body dysmorphia as an excuse for everything, but she's not dysmorphic, she's just overweight. ",

            "So what you're saying is that she really DOES have body dysmorphic disorder, she's just got the direction wrong (she's bigger than she thinks instead of smaller). \n\nYeah, this one really sounds like something you want to hand off to a professional, unless you want to be the dude who breaks it to her.\n\nTry looking up low-cost mental health services. You can often find a therapist who will work something out for you even without insurance. \n\nThe good news is that you have your answer for every single time she brings this up:\n\nHer: \"I'm struggling with BD.\"\n\nYou: \"Yes. A professional can help you deal with that.\"\n\nDon't get sucked into conversations or arguments about it. Professional help is what she needs. Don't feed her delusion further. ",

            "There is a lot of question about whether she has BD or not, so I'm going to leave that to everyone else and just assume she does (not that I actually believe that, but just for argument's sake) . Even then, this situation is not okay. She cannot use her illness as an excuse for every fight. It is not an automatic get out of jail free card. I understand that she cannot afford mental health and that is out of your control. One thing that is in your control is how you treat her when she takes the victim status and uses BD as an excuse. For example, when she uses her BD as an excuse to not eat well you could say something along the lines of \"everyone should eat healthy no matter what size they are. You don't eat fruits and veggies and avoid fried foods just to be a smaller size but also for your long-term health\" ",

') let her know how much you love her and how much you want her to be comfortable in her body, and maybe a pro can help with that. ",
            "> just overweight   \n   \nThat does not mean that she can't have BDD. BDD is about the consuming belief that your outward appearance is significantly bad, usually from the creation of or exaggeration of perceived flaws. And then, these perceived flaws will impair their everyday life. For example (as someone who does have BDD), I can't look at my own reflection or a photo of myself for more than a second or two, because the longer I look the more I ***see***, and the more I see, the more I hate, and the more I hate, the longer I spend looking and hating until I breakdown completely.   \n   \nSo your girlfriend very well could have BDD. And if she does, this is something you're going to want to steer clear of (in the sense of \"what can I do to help?\") and leave it to a professional. BDD isn't easy to deal with or live with, I've had friends from support groups kill themselves over this before. BDD is not an excuse. She being overweight doesn't mean she doesn't have BDD. BDD is about behaviour and ones mental state in relation to their physical appearance. BDD does not mean you *actually* have noticeable physical flaws, it means you *believe* you do, or *believe* your flaws are far worse than they appear to others. Your best bet is to encourage her to seek professional help, and you should probably try to learn a bit more about BDD as well",
            "This would be a deal breaker for me. If she's so delusional about her own situation, how is she going to be about other unpleasant truths in the future?\n\nRather than work on herself and improve herself, she takes the easy way out and finds an excuse to continue to eat more than she should, making her gain more weight.\n\nAnd of course if she continues down this road, and as she gets older her metabolism slows down, she's going to be even more obese. Okay you like her the way she looks now, but will you still feel the same way in ten years after she continues to over eat?",
            "Just tell her. Its not a looks thing and im sick of the \"beautiful how you are\" mentality we have. Plain and simple its shortening her life. Significantly. I'm fat and I need to lose weight for health reasons but I'm regularly told I'm fine the way I am blah blah blah. It's not an unreasonable body image standard or anything. It's heart disease, diabetes, back problems, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and early death. Count calories and exercise.",
            "I understand she doesn't have health insurance or a doctor to talk to, but talking to a medical professional who has actually studied and been trained to recognize BD will show her that she doesn't have it, nothing that you say will change her mind.\n\nDo you have any friends who are psychologists?",
            "Whether or not she has body dysmorphia it seems like she doesn't have a healthy relationship with/connection to her body and probably needs professional help.  It also may be that though it's not a 100% accurate descriptor it feels like it fits to her because it feels the closest to how she feels about her body.  To me it's not about convincing her she doesn't have BD and more about making sure she sees a professional.  As others have said, many mental health clinics have sliding scale pricing so she may be able to get free or low cost help.\n\nAs someone who has struggled with mental health issues (and now have them managed) it doesn't seem healthy to me to define yourself so strongly by a disorder.  And it's not cool to use it as an excuse for bad behavior.  There are times when my issues create problems in a relationship but I'm always trying to do better and improve.",
            "My sense is that she's manipulative. She wants you to feel sorry for her so that it's easier for her to get what she wants from you. \n\nI had a friend like this once -- granted she was about ten years younger -- who claimed to be anorexic and said that it was her friends' fault because we were thin and that made her starve herself. Thing was, she wasn't starving herself. People would see her eating all the time, including really unhealthy stuff like McDonalds. She also never lost any weight. She was actually considerably overweight. She was trying to manipulate us into feeling bad for her and feeling guilty for being naturally thin. It also absolved her of any responsibility for her own health because her \"only problem\" was that she was anorexic and that was our fault. \n\nShe is still the same size today and no longer claims to have a disorder... but she did find other ways of trying to manipulate us until many of us just broke off our friendships with her.\n\nMoral of the story: I'm not saying your gf doesn't have a mental health issue, because this is clearly not normal behavior for a 27 year old. But I don't think it's BDD, and the only one who can fix it is her. \n\nETA -- I've posted about this girl before and got a lot of skepticism, so I wanted to clarify that no she was not bulimic either. Because she spoke so often about her problem we watched her closely and she wouldn't purge after eating. She was just lying. ",

Sad doesn't = depressed, happy doesn't = manic, assholishness doesn't = psychopathy.\n\nEdit - deleted extraneous word",
            "Whether she has body dysmorphia or not, I think a good way to \"get the ball rolling\" in a positive direction is to be supportive and encouraging toward her getting help for it. You don't have to break the news to her. Tell her how much you want her to get help for this because you want her to be happier and for her to improve her life and mental health. Help her find a way to see a professional despite the obsticles. \n\nMaybe you could tell her to talk to her Psychology professor at her college for ideas or recommendations for metal health help w/o insurance? I'm in a similar situation where I'd like to see a professional, but I have no insurance - I've been looking up local resources and when looking under youth health resources I've found plenty of therapists that offer sliding scale payment to adults.",

            "I have no real constructive comment. I just want to mention that it's bizarre she marks over her clothing sizes, either for herself or you, which suggests she is aware of her actual size. It's hard to argue with numbers (weight, measurements, or size). A size 22 is objectively very large. Mindy Kaling, as you've pointed out, is much smaller than a size 22. I think I've read she is a size 12 dress. I wonder what your gf does mentally with such numbers. Seems she sees herself smaller than she is but simultaneously denies the actual math of the situation. Denial is a strong force to reckon with. As others are saying, that reckoning is best left with a trained professional.",
            "I'm gathering that her BD is on the atypical side of the spectrum\u2014as in she sees herself as a smaller person than she me actually be?\n\nFirst off, mental disorders and delusional thinking is not rational, but to the person who experiences it, it can be very real. If you have hallucinations that spiders are crawling all over your body, and you can see them and feel them, they are every bit as real to you as if spiders were crawling all over you. The worst thing in my opinion that you can do to a person who may or may not be suffering is to invalidate their experiences. \n\nJust because you don't see yourself ever behaving the way \"Stephanie\" does, doesn't mean you should apply your rationale. It really isn't your role here to diagnose her or decide that she is just attention-seeking. It doesn't matter if it's true. I can see that fueling resentment and suffering in secrecy on her end.\n\nMy only advice if professional help isn't an option right now is to try to at least be supportive of her experiences as being real to her. It sounds like she's engaged in her own social support, and that's probably a really good thing for her. \n\nI hope you and your partner can talk and work out the way that each of you feel. It's important to communicate to her that you're concerned and want to be supportive before it drives you apart. Best of luck!",

            "I think your GF just invented reverse body dysmorphia.\n\n> Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), also known as body dysmorphia or dysmorphic syndrome, but originally termed dysmorphophobia, is a mental disorder characterized by an obsessive preoccupation that some aspect of one's own appearance is severely flawed and warrants exceptional measures to hide or fix it.\n\nSee what I mean? She's more or less doing the exact opposite of this.",

A lot of people here don't seem to understand either though, including comments which have been massively upvoted.\n\nFor a start, it's not a case of \"she thinks she's fat and she is, so she doesn't have BDD\". While in a lot of cases the person might look perfectly normal, sometimes they are actually ugly, or have a facial deformity, or are fat. The diagnosis can be given to those who have these physical problems and are overly obsessed with them, and let them shape their lives. However, if she's objectively overweight and refuses to accept this and instead label herself 'body dysmorphic', well, she's a lunatic.\n\n\nBDD is hell though. It engulfs every aspect of your life.

It's really hurtful to people with these actual problems when others try and co-opt them because they think it makes them special or unique. If I were to hear your gf say things like that, it would be extremely hurtful and cause me to seriously question myself as someone who is trying to recover. She needs to see a professional, and honestly it sounds like she wants to use this as an excuse to act and do whatever she wants. \n\nYou should not engage, and push for her to stop that.

She doesn't like her weight and found a way to remove guilt and the fact that it's her fault from the situation. I actually see this type of behavior with a lot of people these days. They don't want to put in the effort or habits for a change, so they begin to make excuses that will allow them to make bad choices without feeling bad. By the sound of it, I don't think your gf has BD, sounds like she's just fishing for excuses and wants you to validate those excuses. It's extremely common behavior in this day and age, and rampant among the overweight and obese population, sadly. \n\nPersonally, I think maybe if you gravitate towards healthy changes together and she starts to lose the weight, you might see her feeling more positive about herself and looking for less excuses. If that doesn't work, maybe you should think about whether you want to stay in a relationship with someone who is unhappy with how they are, but unwilling to change and even partakes in habits that will make themselves worse. If she's too deep in, she will continue to make these excuses and shun anyone who says otherwise, while gaining weight all the time. Consider whether that's a future you're willing to have. She's already obese, and she's going the other direction rather than taking care of herself. ",

Would SHE be unhappy at that size or is she more worried what people think. If she point blank asks you what you think of her size you can say something like \"you're a size 22, right? I guess that's bigger but I think you're beautiful\" if you're feeling brave, you could drop it in if she refers to not really being overweight.\n\nCards on the table: I think she's probably quite immature in some ways and has a lot of anxiety about her size and how people perceive her. I think she uses the \"body dysmorphia\" stuff as a safe way to discuss those feelings without fear of people telling her to lose weight, with a side order of wishful thinking. I'd hope that if you give her an outlet to talk about her feelings about her size, the \"dysmorphia\" stuff will either be quietly dropped or will be pushed out into the open, unfortunately probably with some drama.

        "selftext": "**EDIT**\nWow! I didn't expect my post to blow up like this, and thanks to whomever sent me the gold! Reading everyone's replies has helped me realize I made the right choice by leaving him. It's been an emotional rollercoaster, I've cried, laughed, felt scared, felt confused and angered. I know want to go in to counseling, which I'm planning on doing as soon as I'm able to do so. I've managed to block him on my phone, so I don't think I'll have to change my number after all. I called my apartment this morning to see if they could grab the router and cables from my place and hang on to it until they can be retrieved, they were happy to at least do that for me, so now he doesn't have internet! I did listen to a few voice mails he left for me in one message, he was calling me by my pet name, and literally talking in cutesy baby voice to me. The next voicemail he was just yelling at me. They've made me laugh but also make me well, afraid, of him. I've taken everyone's advice and I will be extremely careful for the next few months - I have pepper spray, I won't be traveling alone, and I'll be using campus or police escorts when possible. \n***\n\nSo, things have happened rather rapidly since Tuesday. \n\n[Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/48k7nu/my_23f_so_30m_has_decided_he_doesnt_have_to_pay/)\n\nI talked to my mom some more about what has been going on, I wasn't too open with my parents about how bad it was. She basically wanted to get me out ASAP after I revealed more to her. Anyway, so here is what has happened so far. \n\n* Apartment - it's in my name, the lease is up in May. I talked to my landlord about the situation a bit, basically they can't force him out because there's no official reported criminal activity. He has 30 days to leave. It would also be more expensive for me to break the lease than to pay out for the next two months. Which really sucks. March's rent has already been paid leaving April and May left. The penalty charge is 3 months rent and they can't do anything else. However, I did choose an option to put my apartment \"on market.\" Which basically means they can start showing my apartment after Dipshit's 30 days are up, so he'll have no choice but to leave after that. If they happen to find someone to take the apartment before May 1, I don't have to pay that month's rent. They did copy all the documents and everything I signed and a note for him about getting out in 30 days. I left that in the apartment for him. Since his name wasn't on anything he didn't need to sign anything or be present. \n\n* Jobs - First job: I talked my manager, she was very understanding and was able to start a transfer to a different store near where my parents live. My parents live an hour away from the apartment, btw. I still have to show up to work in my old town a few more times until the transfer is (chance it may not be accpeted) accepted, but my manager and I were able to work out a light schedule. And there will be at least 3 other people in the store with me during those times I'm scheduled. Second job: I called my old professor who was also super understanding, we had a under the table cash only agreement, so it was easy to end that working relationship. It sucked, but she understood. \n\n* A lot of people mentioned that this was an abusive relationship. I did a lot of research on \"signs you're in an abusive relationship,\" and he checks off a lot of boxes. There were a lot of other red flags I didn't even mention in my last post about how horrible he is. This was a huge eye opener for me, and I realized the level of danger I was in by being near him. Unfortunately the revelation I've had has also caused me to feel incredibly depressed, even more so then I felt before. I'm trying not to blame myself for how horrible things have gotten, but it's really hard. I can't help but think that I shouldn't have gone this far in the relationship and that I've permanently damaged myself. But, that's a discussion for another sub. *sigh* \n\n* As I mentioned earlier my mom wanted me to GTFO of my apartment ASAP. I had to convince her not to drive down and take me away in that moment. Dipshit worked last night and would be out of the apartment after 5pm. My mom, dad and uncle arrived at the apartment at 5:30pm. I told my best friend what was happening (who lives close to me) and she came by the apartment as well. The 5 of us were able to pack up pretty much everything I own and put it in all of our cars. So I'm now home! \n\n* Loose ends -\n\n1) I still have a few GRE classes to attend, but it's only once a week.\n\n2) Hopefully the transfer will be approved for my old job, I'm still scheduled to work a few days for the next two weeks in my old town, but it's extremely light. And as I mentioned, multiple people will be in the store with me, I won't be alone at any point. \n\n3) Anything else I need to discuss with my landlord can be handled over the phone/email. I've signed the appropriate documents. I'll likely have to pay damages after the lease has officially ended.  \n\n* Dipshit - He called me late last night after he got off work, and was obviously confused and angry. I refused to tell him where I was, which just pissed him off more. I told him that because he was financially abusing me, as well as emotionally abusing me and scarring me on a regular basis by yelling/punching things/throwing things that I couldn't take it anymore. That I deserved better, that he was a horrible person, that I didn't love him anymore, etc. Well, he stopped being angry and turned on the water works. He apologized profusely, he begged me to come back to him. He said he could change and that he was only acting out because he was depressed and I should give him another chance. He even claimed that he was \"just about to tell me that we're financially even now!\" What are the odds?? It was the most surreal conversation I've ever had in my life. I felt absolutely nothing for him, his tears didn't upset me, his anger didn't upset me, I was just cold and numb throughout the entire conversation. I felt like I was getting bored just talking to him and wanted the conversation to end asap so I could watch Netflix. I literally started to glaze over other things he was saying, he was going back and forth from being sad to angry, and I was just on the phone like \"uh huh, yeah, sure, no..\" Eventually he caught on that I stopped paying attention to him. He snapped at me and asked when I was going to stop this bullshit I was pulling. He started to rage about something, I interrupted him and said I didn't want to talk to him anymore, that he was horrible and owes me thousands of dollars, and I never want to se him again. And then I hung up on him just as he about to put on the water works again. He called and texted a lot, I haven't responded. He's been continuing to call me today as well. My next step is to get a new number. \n\nThanks to everyone who commented in my previous post, or pm'ed me. I wasn't able to get back to everyone, but I did read everything. The next few months are going to rough, but at least I won't be with that asshole anymore. \n\n**tl;dr** Friends and family came to my rescue in an emergency move out last night when Dipshit was at work. I'm safe at home now, but I still have loose ends to tie up with work and the GRE class I'm taking. ",

I can't help but think that I shouldn't have gone this far in the relationship and that I've permanently damaged myself.\n\nThis is an extremely common effect of emotionally abusive relationships, by design. It's also exactly why the abusive behavior ramps up slowly... So you get attached and he can establish a history of good behavior. It makes it easier for them to turn future abuse around on you, and harder for you to leave.\n\nRemembering that can help mitigate it, but it will take time. Be patient and kind to yourself. \n\nOh, and CONGRATULATIONS! You're out! You're FREEE!",

Beyond that make sure you don't talk to him but only communicate through the written word. Screenshot everything just in case. Also tell family and friends not to tell him where you are or what your new number is. \n\nAs always when dealing with family or people who live(d) with keep an eye on your fiances. He has had plenty of opportunities to open your mail and the like. So make sure there are no lines of credit opened in your name you don't know about and he can't access your bank accounts. I would even go so far as to tell your bank you have an ex who might try to gain access to your accounts. If you have any passwords saved on a device he has access to or passwords he knows change them.",

You no longer live with him, but this can be a dangerous time- possibly the most dangerous. Get security to walk you to and from your car if at all possible.\n\nAlso, if you have a smart phone you may be able to block calls from some people.

            "Thank you, thank you for telling your family everything. They love you and want you to be safe and happy. Not drained and abused! Do not feel guilty for being in that situation. Stories like yours are very common, unfortunately. Younger partner, limited relationships, meets older partner with experience. Everything is beautiful the first few months/years. Then the switch is flipped. This makes it easy for them to convince you that A.) You're the problem and B.) they're saints for putting up with you and also they're the only ones who understand and can help you. They paint a picture of you that is just... not at all accurate, but you're so isolated from friends and family that gradually... you start to believe it.\n\nOn average, it takes a person suffering in an abusive relationship SEVEN times to actually break away for good. They keep going back, keep forgiving, because the mind-fuck is just that strong. You did it in ONE shot. I'm stupid hella proud of you, you don't even know!",

            "I would have bet my life savings the conversation was going to go that way. Back and forth between begging and apologies to anger. It's because the apologies and the remorse aren't genuine. It's just what abusive people do in the moment to manipulate, and when it doesn't work, they go back to anger and put downs. Both tactics are to keep the blame on you for the relationship ending. Let it reassure you that he won't change into someone who cares about your wellbeing beyond what you can do for him.",

I'm speaking as someone who was in an abusive relationship for 8 years, from 17 until 25. The guy was 7 years older than me as well, and systematically broke me down. \n\nWell, I rebuilt myself back up with others' help, and now I'm better than ever. I now know what a healthy relationship is, I've been in one for 7 years, and I'm living a life I love. You can do it, too. You are so much stronger than you know. You got out of there like a boss. I'm cheering for you, and all these other people are, too! \n\nGo ahead and go no contact with the terrible ex. Change your numbers, change your email, change all your passwords, and go low on social media for a while. Also make sure no utilities in your old place are in your name. I made that mistake and paid for it with Comcast destroying my credit rating. But it was so worth it to get out and make a clean break.\n\nYou're still so young, and your life is just beginning. Around the bend from this tunnel of darkness will be a great deal of light. Take care.",

All I can say is enjoy being single and doing your own thing and building yourself as a person. \n\nThere will always, always be another dude out there - that's the nature of our society sadly that a female can literally walk out the door and find someone sniffing around - but we as females need to know ourselves and what we want really well and what we are (and aren't!) willing to live with before we worry about \"having a man\" like is pushed on us practically since birth.",

I'm trying not to blame myself for how horrible things have gotten, but it's really hard. I can't help but think that I shouldn't have gone this far in the relationship and that I've permanently damaged myself.\n\nTry not to get too down on yourself - abusers work specifically by gaining your trust and slowly introducing abuse so you don't notice it, and by the time you do it feels \"too late.\" Instead, count your lucky stars that you realized what was going on and dumped him!",

Recognizing and ditching an abusive relationship is a level-up in life. You have just become stronger, wiser, and more of a badass. \n\nIt's normal to need therapy to work through and process the clusterfuck that just happened to you. But I would never say someone like you who took control of a situation like yours has been damaged, it's the exact opposite. ",

Don't ever talk to him or give him so much as a single text or the time of day.\n\n2) Leaving an abusive relationship is really dangerous. Studies say you are most likely to be attacked or even killed by an intimate partner while in the process of leaving. Give your friends and family a heads up about your ex. Make sure you're never alone at the places he knows you will go to such as class or work. If you've got a car, keep it in the garage in case he tries to find you and vandalize it. Be ready to record any interaction or call the cops if tries to confront you and things get hairy, that's what they're there for.",

You were in an abusive relationship and he had done everything in his power to string you along just enough to think it would be different in a weeks time. \n\nThe *only* reason he turned on the waterworks and flipped from angry to upset is because he now has to fend for himself. He no longer has you to do everything and pay for everything for him and he's freaking out about it. Chances are he'll have to go back to mommy and spin a massive web of lies about how much of a bitch you are and how you kicked him out even though he paid for everything. Just keep that in mind and be prepared in case anything like that happens.\n\nBe proud of yourself; you asked for help and got yourself out of that situation and you handled yourself so well when talking to him too.

It might be worth looking into getting some therapy too, you're still in the mindset of someone being abused and I think it would be good to speak to someone about it all. ",

Abusive relationships don't happen over night. It's a gradual thing over a long period of time until one day, you just snap back into reality and think \"WTF is going on!?\" \n\nSpeaking from experience and two long term abusive relationships...there can be shame. The \"how could I have let this go on for so long?\" And a lot of people commented to me about why I put up with it or \"*I* wouldn't have stayed that long if *I* was treated like that!\" If you have those types of people, ignore them.\n\nIt sucks right now, but take the time to enjoy yourself and finding *you* again. That's the best thing you can do! As I said, you are definitely not damaged...if anything, you will come out of this stronger!

Once it's blocked from that point on whenever they call and it goes to voicemail they get a \"this number is no longer in service\" type message.",

You are unhappy because you two aren't a good match and haven't been for who knows how long. And due to him not maintaining the relationship,  but anyway he will grow up once he gets better,  and by you launching a vicious personal attack to him,  this proves that therapy can help you solve your problems with relationships.

A promise ring is basically a commitment to stay faithful and basically a promise stating that \"I will wear this ring until you propose\" you need to tell her that it makes you feel extremely uncomfortable and you really dont appreciate that. If she doesn't have the morals or respect to do something about it then that alone should tell you what to do even though it might hurt you. Definitely red flag.

HR lady was a very much a \"let's all get along\" type and very enthusiastic and eager to mediate with buzzwords and talk about feelings.\n\nHR contacted me and I told them to get Vegan's perspective first so that she wouldn't complain not getting a chance to get her point of view. \n\nSo Vegan, boss and HR had a meeting. I'm pretty sure Vegan made it seem like she had been bullied which was pretty much what I was expecting.\n\nThen the rest of us were called into a meeting with HR to give our points of view.\n\nThe coworker who was a cancer survivor had gotten progressively more annoyed at what happened after the meeting with Vegan taking off so I told her she was welcome to take the lead in the meeting because her issues could have had an actual health impact. \n\nShe took up most of the time actually talking about how Vegan kept giving her unsolicited, medically unsubstantiated advice on cancer treatment and prevention and HR and boss started looking uncomfortable and concerned. A few other coworkers- like the one with coeliac especially also mentioned unsolicited advice.\n\nThe my Peruvian coworker brought up cultural insensitivity and the eating your pets comment and I didn't know Vegan said this to the Hindu coworker but apparently Vegan had told Hindu that veganism would make him a better Hindu because it eliminated all animal cruelty or something.\n\nA few people started laughing at this and one coworker joked that Vegan was like the vegan Amway- always selling something that nobody was interested in.\n\nSo I'd been pretty quiet at that point and HR asked me, why I had asked Vegan to only speak about work related matters and I told her that I'm a hunter and briefly explained that I believe in ethical hunting and how it befitted endangered species etc. But Vegan kept on calling it murder, had a dig at me for my leather skirt even though other people here had leather shoes, leather handbag and HR injected that her Filofax was real leather and I told her the talking to Vegan was stressful and demoralizing and she'd refused to respect my boundaries when I asked her on other occasions to keep things work related.\n\nSo then the \"mediation\" begun and Vegan was brought in and other coworkers left. I basically said exactly what I'd said before to Vegan with HR and boss there, that I respected her lifestyle choice and how passionate she was about making a change but I disagreed with her on certain pointed and even if she didn't agree with my lifestyle choices, it was unfair of her to single me out or harass me about them.\n\nVegan said that to her, what I was doing was morally unconscionable and she didn't believe in exploiting animals.\n\nI told her that her iPhone, her clothes, her computer were all produced via human exploitation and the quinoa that she loves so much has affected local income farmers in Bolivia but.. and then I qualified I told her it was great that she had her thing to try and improve the world but I also had a different perspective and different issues I was more passionate about and that I had respected her point of view and she should respect mine. \n\nVegan's response to all of this was \"it's still murder\". HR looked annoyed at this point and said that Vegan was not trying to find a middle ground.\n\nSo I turned to HR and said that this was why there was no middle ground and that's why I thought keeping things civil and work related because in the end we are here to do a job.\n\nHR agreed, boss agreed, I agreed, Vegan grudgingly agreed and HR wrote all this down and I had mediation meeting minutes saying all of this emailed to the 4 of us.\n\nAnyway, boss called us into a meeting around lunch and said it was a good that we were able to talk about things outside of work because it's good team bonding but \"it had come to his attention\" that there was unsolicited health advice and cultural sensitivity issues in the team we'd be discussing that in our next team meeting and we'd had a productive session but needed to focus on work and keep our spirits up. \n\nVegan had a meeting with boss after that and then went home early.\n\nWe had to come in on a Saturday and today end of month stuff (this happens when the end of month falls on a weekend- I'm in finance) but we get time in lieu.\n\nI just gave Vegan a cheerful good morning to which she didn't respond and when she said handed me a file and said she was leaving, I just said thank you for your work today and enjoy the rest of your weekend. Vegan kind of just grunted at me and left.\n\nI'm just going to keep it civil like HR said and Vegan and dig her own hole. I still feel a bit sorry for her, I still think she feels attacked but at least it got her off my back for the time being. \n\nTLDR: Vegan was told formally by boss and HR to keep things work related and civil.",

            "(Repost lol) I don't know if you have seen The Simpsons, but there's an ep (Lisa the Vegetarian) where Lisa became vegetarian after she found hypocritical she pets a baby lamb in a farm and then eat lamb at dinner. She suddenly started to be critical with everybody who didn't agreed in stop eating meat to the point she ruined Homer's bbq and didn't feel remorse about it. It wasn't until Apu (who is a vegan) told her he learned to tolerate others rather than forcing his beliefs on them. \"You know you can influence people without badgering them always\". So the ep ends with Lisa apologizing with Homer. Of course, Lisa is still vegetarian as promise to Paul McCartney.\n\nIt sorta makes me think someone should tell to that girl (again) that is pretty counterproductive her attitude against other people that don't think like her.

            "It's okay to have your feelings hurt. Instead of moping around and getting more defensive, what Vegan should have done is move forward and learn from her mistakes. \n\nI'm vegan, too, and this is entirely inappropriate. Sure, I wish animals didn't have to be killed or go through unnecessary pain, but unless the other person wants to engage in the discussion, you're only pushing them away from your cause. And for that matter, ethical hunting is incredibly better than getting products elsewhere. When you see progress, you should be happy.

I don't necessarily disagree, but it doesn't do us any good by having vegans become unsolicited preachers. ",

Well done, OP.\n\nI have a few vegan/vegetarian friends, and every so often they jab at me for eating meat. It's something I find I get quite flustered by - I hate when they try to say I'm morally bankrupt or hypocritical for eating meat, yet still having a love and respect for animals and their welfare. I hate having my morals questioned. They have their views, I have mine.\n\nReading this post (and the previous one) has kind of lifted my spirits a little bit. It's not that I ever questioned my own beliefs or diet, but this has inspired me to 'stick by my guns', as it were, and not let them tell me what to do. It's my life, not theirs.\n\nUsually my way of diffusing the situation of a preachy/aggressive vegan/vegetarian is to retort in a manner which turns the mood less serious - making silly remarks which do not add to discussion and are not to be taken seriously. Making light of it is the only way I know how to deal with it without getting angry, and how to escape the situation without becoming 'trapped' in their arguments, if you catch my drift. Surely \"I'm allowed to eat what I want\" and \"I make sure I buy good meat/I try my best to not let meat go to waste\" is good enough, but they keep nagging.\n\nAnyway, your situation sounds like it has invoked a lot more animosity, and has a lot more fire than mine and I'm happy to see that it has finally been resolved in such a peaceful manner, even at the mentioned cost.",

I'm hoping that most people reading this can realize that it often goes the other way, as well. If you have a vegan coworker, don't comment on their lunch every day, or tell them that they should eat meat, or ask them repeatedly why they don't eat animal products, or try to catch them out when you see them wearing leather shoes. Meat eaters are oftentimes more vocally degrading to vegetarians/vegans than the other way around, in my experience. As a habit, maybe nobody should comment on anyone else's diet, or advise them on health matters related to food. Just my 2 cents. \n\nedit:  You know what I find so ironic?  This whole post is about people bullying each other for their dietary choices, and sticking their noses in where they don't belong.  Everyone loves this post and upvotes it, until some vegetarians and vegans point out that \"let's not forget that it goes both ways.  Let's all have some compassion and learn from this example\", and then they get bullied and downvoted into oblivion.

And then of course, if you run out early because someone stole some, insurance doesn't really care, they won't cover a new one until it's been roughly a month since the last one was covered.\n\n(They'll sometimes do an override and pay for it if it was stolen, but this *usually* requires a police report, and then getting in touch with your insurance company, so.. )",

Gotta wonder if you have to press charges for this, but it's going to be hard to prove i guess. Imagine if your kids attack had been worse, your nephew would've been responsible.

How sad is his life that he has to steal a child's life saving medication because he's embarrassed by being fat...\n\nMy daughter has asthma, though thankfully in good control right now, and I'd be furious if this happened.  This would honestly be enough for me to ban the son from my home and it would fuck up my relationship with my sister.  This is not ok.\n\nedit: you said some of the inhalers are broken.  I don't know which one you are using, but can you take the medication canister out and pop it into one of the inhaler housings that isn't broken?

            "Tell her that he gives the inhalers back now or you'll report him for stealing px meds.\n\nAlso, why did your sister not take them back when she found them? That is messed up. By leaving them there and telling you there's nothing she can do, she's supoprting her son in this.",

As much as I don't like the idea of letting bad behavior slide, it sounds like your sister has a lot more to deal with than the cost of the inhalers if her 20 year old unemployed son is stealing inhalers in order to poorly trick people into thinking he has asthma rather than a very serious and obvious weight problem. If your relationship with your sister is otherwise good (which it sounds like it is if she confronted him instead of immediately defending his behavior), I'd let the cost slide, but tell her his behavior is totally unacceptable, actively put your son's life at risk, and that he will no longer be allowed to your home.",

Because stealing is something he can do. Can't make it up the stairs, can pick your stuff up and put it in his pocket.\n\nGive your sister a choice... someone pays... or she lets you in his room and you just take goods of your choice that you feel are of similar value to you... or you file a police report about the theft and he'll probably end up cautioned.\n\nAnd never let him in your house again.",

Tell your sister that sorry, these are medicine and they cost money and he is going to be held responsible because he's 20 years old.\n\nI'd probably emphasize that what he did is illegal.

He's fat, he did it to himself, and thought that stealing a child's asthma medicine would shift blame from him being obese. What the Fuck is up with his mental state? I think he should definitely pay you back if not money, then labor of some sorts. He's an adult, he has to deal with consequences since his own mother clearly won't make him deal with the consequences. \n\nAlso he should really get his life together. It's fine taking time in your early 20's to figure shit out, but living at home doing nothing and remaining morbidly obese is not in any way healthy physically or mentally. ",

Tell him your son's life is in danger because of what he did and you have no choice. And then follow through.

I only say this because he confessed to the left and said it was because of his image problems... that's a cry for help if I've ever heard one, and his mother isn't going to help him. That's a huge responsibility that's going to require a ton of patience and forgiveness and I wouldn't think less of you if you didn't do it. ",
            "Here's what I think. **HE** should pay you back and I don't think you should ask your sister for the money because he's an adult. It doesn't matter how he gets the money (I mean, stealing it isn't ok, obviously) he can work for it, borrow it, pawn some of his own items, whatever it takes to pay your family back for what he stole from your young son.\n\n\nOK, first find out how much it will cost to replace the inhalers. Is it just a matter of covering the copays because insurance will approve a refill or will your insurance deny the claim because it's too early to refill?\n\n\nSince he won't take your calls I think you should call your sister about this one last time. Tell her you want to speak to him and if he doesn't want to talk that's ok, you just need him to listen. She can just use speakerphone with him in the room or something. Tell him that unless he repays you the $X that you need to replace the stolen items by a particular date (maybe give him until Monday or a week or whatever) you will be forced to file a police report for the stolen medication. You can suggest that he find some work on Task Rabbit, borrow the money, pawn his xbox or whatever, but you need the inhalers replaced. Then follow through.\n\n\nNow, I think some people will say that kind of a threat is extortion, which is illegal. I am not a lawyer, so I don't know if that meets the legal definition of extortion, so if you'd like to follow my advice you should find out for sure whether that kind of threat is illegal in the jurisdiction in which you live (I think the folks over at /r/legaladvice are quite helpful).\n\n\n\nI see a few people suggesting that one way he could pay you back is to do some chores for you. I think that is a bad idea given the way you have described your nephew. Is going to be \"able\" to mow your lawn, for example? Would he actually follow through on any kind of chore agreement you came to or would he stop showing after the first week? And finally, having some kind of chore agreement would probably require him to go into your home again, which I'm guessing you don't want.",

I think an apology is the absolute least you should demand - not to you but to your daughter for endangering her health. He may be 20 but it sounds like he's immature for his age. It's not up to you to fix that but the least you can expect is a proper all policy from him to your little one.\n\nShe's right by the way. The smiley faces help. ",

He needs to understand that he put your son in serious, life-threatening danger (I'd literally use the words \"he could have died\"), and that pretending to have asthma will not abate his insecurities - he will still be overweight. \n\nThe reason I'm suggesting to cut him a break is because he is clearly very ashamed of who he is, enough to do something so stupid. Perhaps if he had someone to talk to about his insecurities, to help him find other ways to deal with the cause of his actions, you will be able to help in improving your nephews well-being and stay on good terms with your sister. He might be an adult, but even adults who do stupid things (especially out of a place of pain) are worthy of compassion. \n\nThe loss of the money is unfortunate, it really is, but forcing it out of your sister's family in one way or another (even if it's right that they do pay it back) will not address the underlying cause, which means it's only bound to cause more problems in the future. Perhaps it will also show your nephew that treating people with compassion means to right his wrongs of his own accord. ",
            "I'd let it slide either way. Your nephew sounds like he's got a pretty miserable existence and even though he's 20 he's probably got the mentality of someone in their mid teens and he may not have known the cost of the inhalers or considered the danger he could have put his cousin in. I doubt he has health insurance and he likely took them because he thought they could help him breath better, since he would only need one if it was just a prop like he said. He's probably embarrassed and ashamed at this point and obviously it's pointless expecting him to pay anything back without an income.\n\nIf your sister can pay and she is just refusing, I would keep on her  but try to mostly move on for your own sake. If she struggles financially and can't easily afford to pay you for them I'd just let it go but tell her she is paying for dinner the next couple of times you go out together even if that doesn't cover the cost.\n\nEdit - God forbid one of the suggestions in this thread is to forgive, or have some empathy for those that wronged her(blood relatives), or even just to let it go despite being her being wronged just so she doesn't have this eating away at her. It's her nephew, not a stranger. She probably played with him as a baby and changed his diapers. \n"
