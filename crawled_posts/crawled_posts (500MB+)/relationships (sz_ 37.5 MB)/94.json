        "selftext": "My previous dog passed away last year. When I got him, I named him \u201cJasper\u201d because he looked like a \u201cJasper\u201d. When he passed away I was devastated. After several months, I got a new puppy and named him \u201cJasper\u201d. I\u2019ve grown attached to the name at this point. \n\n\nMy SIL just had a baby and named him \u201cJasper\u201d as well. When she found out my dog\u2019s name is also Jasper, she got really angry and upset. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the hormones, but she completely overreacted and called me names. I got my puppy first and named him first. She never told anyone of possible names she was planning on for her son, so how was I supposed to know she was going to name her son the same name as my dog? I\u2019m not sure what to do right now. She went on Facebook and ranted about it so most of my family knows about this mess. One of my cousins called me and laughed about it. It\u2019s ridiculous right? I\u2019m not a mind reader. How was I supposed to know she was going to name her son that? My parents love to see my puppy and they know that I named my puppy \u201cJasper\u201d so she must not have told my parents or they could have warned her in advance. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do now. I won\u2019t be changing my dog\u2019s name as that name is significant to me so don\u2019t suggest that. My brother hasn't visited me in the past year as we live 4 hours away from each other. So I don't think he knew that I named my new puppy \"Jasper\" again. Personally I also don't really see what's the big deal either. So what if they share the same name? It's not a big deal. \n  \n**tl;dr**: SIL is upset that she named her son the same name I gave my dog. ",

If you google the name \"jasper\" it's highly likely a lot of other animals and criminals and unsavoury people have the name, too. I've got to hope it's just hormones; pregnancy hormones/breastfeeding hormones they do crazy things. I would cry at things that normally didn't upset me and laugh at things that I normally didn't find too funny at the drop of a hat, and you get super over protective and irrational about baby's future (like, oh my god, my kid has the same name as a dog and everyone is going to find out and all the kids in preschool will know and laugh at him and we will have to move and change our names ect). \n\nSo, in no way is this your problem.

I cried because my cat ran away when I was teenager and my new cat did something that reminded me of her. That doesn\u2019t mean I want my new cat to be my old cat or that I\u2019m still broke hearted about my cat from 8 years ago. It means I was sad about something that was a big part of my life changing and even now, years later, it was something that sucked. And breakups suck. Even if you\u2019re over them.

            "When I was around 18 years old, I had my first real relationship. We were together for quite awhile and went through a lot. In the end I realised that I wasn\u2019t in love with them (although I did love them) and wanted something else. We broke up. \n\nA year later I met someone else who I fell crazy in love with, feelings I had never felt before (and when they broke up with me 2 years later it shattered my heart). However, a couple months after we started dating I found out that my 1st ex started dating someone new (someone I actually knew quite well), and although I knew it was bound to happen, it hit me like a ton of bricks. I started to cry. My partner at the time was there and asked me what was wrong and I cried and cried in their arms and told them how I was feeling (really hurt). \n\nI realise now that I probably gave into those feelings a little too much and just spilled them all over the person I was with, which wasn\u2019t fair on them. I see now how much that may have hurt that person. However, I didn\u2019t see it like that at the time, I saw it as expressing my feelings to the person I loved. It didn\u2019t take away from how much I loved them... it was just a shock to the system. That\u2019s it. I was feeling something and wanted to share it.\n\nLooking back years later, it\u2019s kinda odd to think that I reacted so violently to the news of my first ex moving on, because I was BY FAR way more in love with my 2nd ex. Feelings are funny like that. Some might even say that you can have powerful feelings for more than one (or two or three) people in your lifetime (spoiler alert - of course you can).

            "Lol he said that she moved on too fast and you guys have been in a relationship for a year? Try to work out that logic. Dump him.",
            "I personally would break up with him because I couldn\u2019t be with someone still hung up on their ex like that. Anyone still in love with their ex does not have the heart or capacity to be in love with and give their attention to someone else. I\u2019d also feel like I had been lied to (in terms of his overall feelings, and whether or not whatever he\u2019d been saying to me was true), but if you\u2019ve been together a year he obviously does like you. It\u2019s completely up to you. Either decision is justified.",
            "Lol what??\n\nYou guys have been together for a year or so\n\n\nHe hasn't seen his ex in like a year or so and is mad that she \"moved on fast\"..... while you guys have been together almost since they broke up?\n\nAnd hes \"heartbroken\" over it? \n\nGirl this guy considers you a rebound. He was heartbroken that his ex moved on \"fast\" after a year while he has been dating you for a year.\n\nYou need to drop this guy.",
            "I once dated a guy like this. For five years. He left me to go back to that girl and he married her. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that will always happen. I\u2019m just saying that I really wish I would have listened to that warning sign earlier in our relationship. You\u2019re 25 years old. You have plenty of time to find a spouse (if that\u2019s what you want), but you don\u2019t have plenty of time to waste with people that do not prioritize you.",
            "I'm so sorry this happened to you. But wait.. He moved in with you but isnt okay with ex moving on?? \n\nOne set of rules for him, and another for his girlfriends, especially on emotional matters, are a huge red flag.\n\n Is he like this on other things as well?",
            "Drunken words are sober thoughts.\n\nI'm not sure how things are between you two, so honestly you must decide for yourself.",
            "This is probably a stretch, but is it possible he wanted you to know? I\u2019ve been drunk several times before, and unless you\u2019re blackout drunk, it\u2019s not difficult to reason to an extent. As in, some things are clearly still bad decisions even if you\u2019re intoxicated. Maybe that\u2019s just me. So how much did he have to drink? I almost think he chose to call you instead of a \u201cbro\u201d or something because he wanted to confess to you he still had feelings for his ex. It\u2019s possible he\u2019s felt guilty and wanted to finally tell you. It struck me as odd that he thought it would be wise to confide in his girlfriend over how torn up he is over his ex unless he wanted you to know. Does that make sense? Again, I could just be overthinking it, but based on my experience with alcohol, I can\u2019t wrap my head around why he would call you over someone else for something involving an ex.",
            "Home country- I wonder if they were still officially together while he was dating you. He wanted you both? But she dumped him so he is surprised. Just my guess. Lots of guys in my town have gfs here and wives/kids back home.",
            "Wait- you\u2019ve been together for a year? Does he think HE moved  on too fast? Sounds like he\u2019s still carrying a torch for her. I\u2019d move on from this relationship.",
            "So u been long distance since 2018, but dating for a year. Its 2020, can you explain?",
            "Oh, OP... Long distance is only worth it, if you 100% love and trust your partner. For me it sounds you'd deserve better.",
            "Why is it fine that he has moved on with you, but hurtful and heartbreaking that she has done the same thing with another man? Double standards, red flag. Bye bye.",
            ">should I break up with him?\n\nI don't know if I'd quite recommend ending things immediately, but I'd be extremely wary and definitely be on guard. My main concerns would be:\n\n* that he's still obviously feeling raw and wounded and emotionally invested in his ex;\n* that he's so lacking in good sense and judgment that he thought you were the best person to talk to about his feelings in this department;\n* that he's the kind of person to get into drunken arguments with his ex at bars;\n* that he thinks she \"moved on too quickly\", but he also found a new partner in that time, which strikes me as pretty hypocritical.\n\nAlso, I'm a bit confused about the timeline here - you say you've been seeing each other for a year, and two of those years were long-distance? How long ago did he end things with his ex?\n\nEdit: this just happened, so I'd wait until he calls you in the cold light of the morning with a genuine apology and some reflection about how he acted. If that's not forthcoming then I'd probably reconsider your relationship with him.",
            "I cannot believe he called up his current girlfriend to sob at her about his ex breaking his heart by being with another bloke. Talk about picking your audience!  What was he expecting? Tea and sympathy?\n\nBreaking up with him is entirely your choice, nobody can tell you whether it's the right or wrong decision but honestly? I wouldn't be anyone's consolation prize so be absolutely sure where you stand. Is he with you because you are the one for him, or because you're the next best thing to the ex?\n\nHe is with you, yet she has moved on too fast? sounds like an ego thing in part at least. He wants her pining forever for him while he got back out there a YEAR ago?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to have a cards on the table chat. If he doesn't understand how massively inappropriate his actions were then he has a problem.",
            "There\u2019s something fuckedupedly poetic that you were the source of comfort he sought out to share this with. Talk to him when he\u2019s sober.",
            "In vino veritas unfortunately.",
            "That would make me very uncomfortable. I think that if he hasn't moved on after a year, and has to call you telling you that, (his current girlfriend who should make him so very happy), it might be better to forget this guy. How long is it going to take him to realize he has you? Are you not enough? Really?!?!? Heck no I would do what you feel you should do in your heart. Also he is long distance. You might as well find someone near you that makes your heart happy and doesnt' have baggage like that.",
            "I\u2019m 50/50 on this. If my boyfriend still gave a crap about his ex after a year of being with me I would drop him lol \n\nBUT it is worth having a serious sober conversation with him. If he really hasn\u2019t moved on from her it\u2019s best you guys take a break and reevaluate what you both want out of this relationship.",

            "hurt people, hurt people. do what's best for you sis",
            "It sounds like he's not ready. Maybe break up with him and see how things are in the future.",
            "move on. he's still carrying a torch for her.",
            "I firmly believe, that the truth comes out when alcohol is involved. Whatever anyone tells you in that state, is as close to the truth as you can get.\n\nWhile it's possible he genuinely likes you, he obviously is also still in love with his ex. I personally would be offended and reassing the relationship. A year with you is a long time for him to still have these feelings about his ex.",
            "Yes, you should break up.  Never stay with anyone and KNOW  you are their 2nd pick(unless 1st pick is deceased).",
            "Break it off, it'll hurt less once you move on and he does too. Maybe then u can try again",
            "Yup definitely.    He is disrespecting you and playing with your emotions.   You deserve better",
            "Your only option is to move on even quicker than his ex",
            "I'm always iffy about ex talk, especially if they've been broken up for a while and you've been dating them for a while. How long had they been broken up before you two started dating? Because it seems like he never really got over her before moving onto someone else. I mean, maybe others could deal with it, but I'd be very worried if my partner is *heartbroken* over his ex moving on; like, have you not moved on, as well? Didn't they obviously move on a long time ago? And why would there have been an argument? Was your boyfriend actually upset that she'd moved on? It's all just too weird to ignore.\n\nAnd everyone is talking about \"they were drunk and it's a dumb mistake\"... drinking just releases you from your inhibitions, so this is obviously something that's been on his mind, not just something that popped up out of the blue; drinking doesn't excuse you or render you stupid or erase your memory or anything else. I wish people would stop acting like it's some huge get-out-of-jail-free card because it is not.",
            "If he truly moved on he wouldn't even feel hurt but relieved that she moved on fast. I personally would take a step back and reevaluate this whole situation and think to myself is it really worth it going through a heartbreak because my boyfriend wants to be selfish and not consider how I would feel. Usually when someone is drunk , the true selves of them come out since there is no wall stopping them .",
            "You're the rebound. You're the flirty butterfly in the midst of their story.\n\nGet out...",
            "You mean from the start of 2019 ? \nStart of 18 it's 2 years now. \n\nPlus, if you and him have been long distance from the start, in review of this particular event, he never really considered you two to be serious, more like a very good convenient friendship... \nI also get the impression that if she ever asked him back, he would in a heart beat. \n\nSucks, but yeah..",
            "Have a sober conversation and be honest about your feelings. Breaking up may be best, but only after the sober talk first. He at least needs to understand the problem so he has a chance to fix it, if not for you for his own future.",

            "Would break up with him",
            "Getting over a breakup is like grieving a death. Moving on from it isn\u2019t a linear progression. Seeing someone who hurt you can bring back a lot of feelings all at once. Absolutely none of this means that he\u2019s not over her or that he\u2019s not ready to be with you. \n\nTalk to him when he\u2019s sober and see what he says.",
            "Yeah, I would break up with someone that did this.",
            "I will have to say, I may give a little slack given being drunk, seeing an ex you had really been into can be painful. But this is a year into a different relationship, Not sure how long it had been between the ex and OP. That he said she had moved on too soon when he has been with OP for a year. That is a massive red flag.  I do not blame OP at all.",
            "Yes, he has unresolved feelings. Set him loose.",
            "Just dump him, honestly I promise you it\u2019s not worth it. Have some self respect.",

            "A drunk man's words are the sober man's thoughts. He may not say it when he's sober but that doesn't mean it's not true. Time to move on for you.",
            "Whatever you decide its how you deal with it after your decision. Only you truely know if this is  a blip or the evidence you felt was required to prove he doesnt see you as his significant other. \nWho trueky ended the previous relationship would go some way to answering all your questions.",

            "No matter what anyone says I can tell you right away you\u2019re always gonna feel invalidated because of this and it\u2019s always gonna be in the back of your mind so unless you can push past that then stay but trust me I know how that feels. I was the one that stayed even after he went back to his ex and they broke up and he called me for advice it was truly heartbreaking",
            "Dear young people,, I just turned 57. If you don\u2019t still love someone from many years ago, you have never actually experienced true love. Moving on does not mean not loving anymore. It means moving on regardless.",
            "The drunk mouth speaks sober thoughts.",

            "I\u2019m sorry but if I broke up and felt that much about the situation The last thing I would want to do is start saying another person! No offense but it\u2019s just silly to rebound imo if you still have feeling for an ex that means your not giving 100% of yourself to the new relationship you know?",
            "Reading this, I really want to say how appreciative I feel towards someone I love dearly but is adamant against starting a relationship with me until he\u2019s gotten over his ex. \n\nI\u2019m persistent and I keep promising him I wouldn\u2019t pry into that healing, thinking that he could heal while loving me at the same time. But, he\u2019s firm on refusing to disrespect me by being in a relationship with me while he gets over his ex. \n\nOP, you deserve to find a man who\u2019s just as noble as the one I love. Your bf shouldn\u2019t use you to get over his ex. You deserve to be in a relationship in which both hearts are fully devoted to each other.\n\nEdit: on second thought, I also think you might want to consider if him feeling bad about his ex moving on too quickly might just be causing him to doubt his self-worth. I\u2019ve been cheated on before (as we probably all have), and the deepest pain I felt was over questioning my own value: \u201cI bent over backwards and made so much sacrifice for him, but he immediately bought her a car during the initial stages of attraction...how much value do I have as a person and how much was my love worth?\u201d",
            "\"Yeah, sounds like you did too\"",
            "In my experience, drunk words speak a sober heart/mind. These are clearly suppressed feelings he's been holding onto. By being with OP, he's trying to move on from his ex, but he might have tried to move on too soon before he could process his feelings. \n\nDefinitely speak with him when he's sober. Ask him if he still has strong feelings for his ex. Ask him if you're just a distraction from the ex or if he genuinely wants to be in a relationship with you. \n\nBut hey, whatever OP decides to do, I'll be here for you if you ever need to talk. I've been in this situation too many times before. I've also been on both ends of this situation so I could give you a bit of insight if you'd want to DM me. \n\nI hope that with whatever the outcome is, it's in your best interest.",
            "sounds like he still loves her",
            "I would say it is important to realize that you are not and will never be the only person your BF has feelings for. You can be his best girl, but you can't stop him from having to struggle with the sadness the events from his past made him feel. The fact that he reached out to you means he feels secure with you, and holding this over his head will only go to show your BF and other men who read this that men really can't open up emotionally to their partners. Your BF probably had a longer history with his ex than with you, so you need to understand that his emotions will be hurting for some length of time relative to how much dating history he had with his ex. If this is the first big breakup for him, it will take a lot of time to recover. It took me about 1.5 years to recover from my most significant breakup.",
            "OP, it fucking sucks when an ex moves on too quick. It makes you feel inadequate and replacable and like everything you shared was \"less than\". He confided in you that he was hurt at this fact and your response is to break up. Hes not saying he loves her, hes saying it hurts seeing how replacable he is.",
            "It's a long distance relationship to begin with. \n\nYou deserve to be with someone who knows what they want and that should be you. All of you and none of anyone else if you're monogamous. \n\nYou'll know when you meet the right person and that cute lovely feeling never goes away. Be patient and completely honest and true to yourself, and it can happen.",
            "Like everyone else is saying, definitely have a sober-talk, but a year is for sure not \"too fast,\" especially if he's dating you?? Makes no sense",
            "You should remind him that it doesn\u2019t matter if she got with someone in a day or in a year, it\u2019s his ex and her actions are not his problems anymore. That\u2019s why they\u2019re exes. \n\nWould not break up with him for confiding in you but would break up if getting emotionally drunk constantly is a problem of his. Nobody wants a sloppy drunk as a boyfriend, that\u2019s something he needs to handle on his own.",
            "I don't understand why you would break up with him. \n\nI have dated and loved others while still getting over exes. It's a slow process. It's not like he's been unfaithful.",

            "It depends on the type of person he is and the relationship you're in.   \nDo talk with him but keep your emotions in check.  \nDon't ask him to choose and don't ask him if he wants to stay with you.   \nHe's going to say yes because that's an easy answer and solution.",
            "This is anecdotal at best, but I found out after dating my SO for 6 months that my\nex SO had gotten his ex girlfriend pregnant while we were still talking. I was pretty upset and had an insecurity meltdown. I love my\nSO, but past baggage triggered me and I had a lot of new information to process.",
            "This needs a further conversation first because there could be nothing there but it still feels like shit when you find out someone moved on super quickly. My ex moved on after less than 24hrs and it crushed me because it feels like shit to find out that you basically meant nothing to them. Especially when alcohol was involved his phrasing probably wasn't perfect and it came off worse than it actually is.",
            "I think his feelings are fair but sharing them with YOU wasn\u2019t fair. However, between the feelings of sadness and the lack of control when choosing you as his phone call, that does fall into the nature of alcohol-based behavior. I\u2019ve been hurt when almost any ex, even if the feeling of love has long-since subsided, has moved on. Endings hurt. On one hand, it\u2019s nice that on a deep level he may feel comfortable sharing very sensitive information but I wish that regardless of the drinking and how he was feeling, there was some sort of impulse to preserve your emotional needs. Because as his partner, how are you supposed to be the one to help him with this sort of thing? That\u2019s not quite your responsibility- that\u2019s his and his friends\u2019 role. \n\nI do think the fact that you\u2019re long-distance makes this much more difficult because trust and dedication is the foundation of this relationship\u2019s functionality. Part of that trust is knowing that your love is reciprocated and valued. If you feel that you will genuinely never feel comfortable again after at least a week or so has passed, as well as a few honest and sober conversations, I would end it. If you come to feel that it was perhaps just a human moment of emotion, I wouldn\u2019t hold onto it so deeply. Everyone fucks up eventually. \n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s your heart and if you feel that your security is going to be forever jeopardized, you\u2019re well within your right to move on. Don\u2019t let others invalidate that. I would give it some time; issues like this are destined to pop up in some capacity after a year. No judgment to whatever you decide because I know I\u2019d be hurting, too; I would just give yourself time to \u201csit\u201d on it and see if your trust and security can recover if you feel that this relationship is worth it. \n\nMuch love to you!",
            "His decision to call you when drunk is obviously a poor one because you're going to feel insecure, worrying if he's still harboring strong feelings for his ex-partner and he was in no fit state to help reassure you.\n\nAlcohol has probably played a big factor, affecting both his judgement and emotions. I would hope ordinarily he wouldn't get into an argument with an ex-girlfriend in a public place - especially when he's in another relationship. This is possibly a good way to gauge just how drunk he was.\n\nI think the fact he's not seen his ex-girlfriend for such a long time means that seeing her with another man for the first time is going to be difficult or at least a shock. That is the one issue that perhaps he hadn't needed to address before getting into a relationship with you.\n\nI'm not sure breaking up is the right answer, at least not yet. You both need an honest conversation when he's sober and well rested from his drinking session. Make sure you're not distracted by other things and go through how this has made you feel.\n\nIf he's in a current relationship with you, i'm not sure how he can be upset that his ex-girlfriend has found another partner. Does he feel that he also moved on too quickly? A year is a very long time. Did you both get together quickly after the breakup?\n\nAsk the obvious questions. Is he able to commit and focus on this relationship, without looking back? Why did he feel upset seeing his girlfriend with someone else when he's in a relationship himself?",
            "It isnt a year \"gone to waste\" unless you insist it is or else want to stop it now. It can hurt to see someone you once had so many feelings for again. There is guilt there too, not just regret, not just feeling sorry for oneself. It can hurt, would hurt me to this day if I saw my ex with anyone else despite my being married happily for years now to another wonderful woman. I've moved on years ago but there is still a lot of complex emotion there.\n\nThis situation is what you make of it. Of course hearing that someone you love ever had feelings for someone else will hurt a bit but this doesnt have to be a dealbreaker for this very real relationship unless you want it to be.",
            "Okay sorry to be that person, but did you start dating at the start of 2018 or 2019? You said a year and the start of 2018 would be 2 years, which isn\u2019t a majorly important detail but one year is very different from two.",
            "Feelings dont just disappear, sometimes they take a long time to dissolve. That doesnt mean he doesnt love you, too. I'd cut him some slack. He felt vulnerable, and he knows he can call you, so he did. Obviously he was drunk and didn't realize how that might be a bad idea, but if you care about him I'd say stick it out. It will mean a lot to him if you do stay.",
            "I don\u2019t really know what to think about the situation itself, but I think it\u2019s good that he called you to confide in. He could have called his friends to play it safe, but he called you, because he sees you as someone who loves him no matter what.",
            "Be sure to check out r/longdistance if you do continue with the relationship!",
            "No you cant hold that against him when people drink they get emotional I'm sure if he was sober he would have said bvb hey what's up and just stayed for a bit and then left with his friends. Alcohol makes emotions blow up bigger than they are like anger. I dated a girl for five years and it took some time to get over but that's just how we are as humans time heals the heart and you cant hold that against him. It's been a year and I'm guessing his ex probably put him through hell, maybe he should talk to someone about it, I understand you being hurt that makes sense but if you are willing to leave him over something small like him being upset after drinking too much and getting mad at his ex then maybe you shouldn't be together. Emotional healing takes time and understanding and if you cant have his back or just dont want to deal with it then leave him and move on so you can be happy and he can find someone whom he can depend on and reveal his honest emotions to without backlash.",
            "Did he say he LOVES her or just that he's hurt she got over him so quickly? \n\nI'm not a huge fan of the 'no ex talk' rule in relationships... Yes it can potentially trigger some jealousy but I think as long as you're honest, being able to talk about anything with your partner is valuable. Unless he said he still has romantic feelings for her, I think it's a good thing that you, as his girlfriend, were the first person he wanted to go to when something emotional and hurtful happened.",
            "Allow me tell you a story before telling you what I would do. \n\nThere was this guy I was madly in love with and best friends with, I had waited a couple of years to be with him (that\u2019s a different & irrelevant story) and when we finally got together and had been dating for maybe a month or two.... he cried in front of me because this girl he had a little thing with unfriended him on Facebook. \n\nI sucked it up and didn\u2019t complain much. \n\nThen I found out eventually they were still in contact. Found out he showed her his dick on skype. Told her he loved her and always will. There were many more instances. At one point, he even asked me if I mind if he meets her (they hadn\u2019t met, they \u201cmet\u201d online). \n\nLong story short, his feelings for her are what ended our relationship after many years of us being together. And if I had paid attention to that sign in the beginning, I wouldn\u2019t have been as heartbroken in the end. \n\nI would break up with him, personally.",
            "I would end it. Him still being upset about seeing his ex with someone new a year later is a huge red flag. He moved on with you, and the fact that he said he is heart broken means he\u2019s still not over her. It\u2019s best to end the relationship to save yourself from further heartache. Sorry to hear, that really sucks, but trust me it will be better for you in the long run.",
            "I would move on to someone who actually lives near you. The fact that he\u2019s mooning over his ex after being with you so long, plus long distance just sounds like a waste of time.",

So it's a real thing that can be an issue. I hope it's not for you. It kinda sucked for me but I'm sure one day I'll find someone who's actually excited about me.",

But I also haven't been in a long-term relationship since then so I do wonder if it has more to do with missing being in a committed relationship. We also work together so we see eachother a lot which probably hasn't helped.",
            "I wasn\u2019t over my ex when I started dating a really nice guy. I never told him when I was hurting for my ex. That he sought you when he was vulnerable and hurt says a lot. Talk to him.",
            "First of all, this was very disrespectful to you. He did not even consider how you would feel after telling you these things. \n\nSecondly, I think it's very unlikely that he actually still has feelings for his ex. I think it was just him being drunk. I mean realistically, if he hasn't shown any signs of obsessing over his ex, the chances are he moved on long time ago. \n\nThirdly, while one could appreciate his transparency and honesty and the fact that he communicated this to you, it also shows a complete lack of self-awareness. He should have been more aware of how this might make you feel as well as realise that he was just being drunk. \n\nI don't think that he necessarily crossed the line then, but it was borderline. \n\nverdict: talk to him about it and how it made you feel, have him make sure whether he has or has not got any past feelings for his ex.",
            "I have been with my boyfriend for almost three years now and sometimes I still bring up my ex. I know that sounds bad, but my bf has told me that if there is something that is hurting me, then I should talk to him about it. Being able to talk about my ex and how hurt I still feel about it has definitely helped me and even makes him feel happy that I can trust him to talk about it.\n\nI have definitely moved on from my ex, but it's what went down that I am still upset about. Maybe your bf isn't necessarily hung up on his ex, but just the situation and what went down when they broke up?\n\nIf you really love him and want to continue the relationship, I would give him a chance to talk to you about it when he's sober and see how it goes. It would really suck if you break up only to realize that it might have just been drunken talk (which is totally normal.)",
            "RIP,kind of ashamed to admit this but I was once in your BFs shoes. I used to talk about my BD all the time with people I was dating, usually me venting about how I was angry at him for not assuming responsibility for my kiddo. I had one too many shitty drunken nights where I said shit about how I hated that he started seeing other people and etc. \nPoint is, it's not easy. Healing from a bad breakup sucks ass, and sometimes we meet someone we like and think \"okay, I can get over this person and be happy with someone else\" and it almost becomes a thing you do out of spite. And ofc the argument is always \"but you moved on too\" and that's true, but m a n, it doesnt hurt any less, and that sucks. \nYour bf is still in his bag and it's up to you whether you want to work through it or whether it's too much for you.  \nIf you work it out, patience goes a long way and boundaries go even farther. \nBut please keep in mind to be kind and rational if you decide to cut ties: he cant help the feeling, and trust me. Even if we overreact in the moment, we realize the importance of communication when we (if we) snap out of it. He may have made the mistake of moving on while he was still hurting, but it's never because he wanted to hurt you.",
            "He is in another country for more than a year?",
            "He sounds hypocritical. I mean, did he not move on with you? This is confusing.",
            "Oh hell no...that's just unacceptable tbh.",
            "In vino veritas. \n\nUnprocessed emotions finally bubbled up and came out.  He probably also feels guilty for using you as a rebound and didn't get into this relationship for the right reasons, so he is using being drunk as an \"excuse\" to tell you the truth.  I know it hurts, but at least you know before you invested too much.",
            "Although I totally understand where you're coming from and how upsetting that conversation must've been but I do hope you can take some of the advice others have given you. I also would recommend frying to see things from another perspective, just because he felt those things in a moment of drunk weakness doesn't mean that he does feel that way at all. I would try chalking it up to it being one of the first times he has made contact with her which caused a flood of suppressed emotions to come out and they were amplified by being blacked out drunk.  I would give it a little time and let him think kn the fact that either he really does still care for her or it was a major lapse in judgment and he had just put off those feelings for so long that he couldn't help but have them come spilling out after seeing her and at that point arguing with her. I hope you tmrethink your stance in feeling like the last year of your life was a waste because clearly he has to love you back or else why would he (although very stupidly) called YOU and told YOU about what he was feeling, that shows where his heart really is. Even if he wasnt over his ex and this is something he has felt the entire time I you two have been together I would also implore you to bot take it in that way and look at the last year fir what it has been in your mind previously not what you are making it out to be now",
            "Definitely break up! He\u2019s stupid - did he not move on too quickly too? Honestly he\u2019s too immature to be in a relationship",
            "They call them spirits for a reason.",
            "Not worth breaking up over. Seeing an ex for the first time unexpectedly and while drunk can definitely be a shock to the system and result in a huge emotional roller coaster. How long were they together for? I agree with another post that said he was just hurt because he felt replaceable. He was drunk and emotional, id just speak to him when he is sober and see what happens there.",
            "OP, I think you should check to make sure how he feels about you before you conflate his sadness over his ex with actual love for her -- sometimes people get hung up over their exes and it's not that they'd like to get back together. It might just be that the feelings of abandonment, betrayal, etc are still lingering and he's in a place where he hasn't been able to get over the pain their relationship or the breakup caused him.\n\nI understand it may hurt for you to see him feel anything about his ex at all, but try to understand that he may not be able to help that without time and perhaps therapy. He may love and trust you very much. Don't force yourself to stay with him, but please talk to him before you make a major decision like this, for your own sake as well.",
            "Id talk to him about it ,both spber of course...if he still feels the same, then id seriously consider breaking up. Its not fair to you if hes still has feelings for someone else, sucks you waisted a year of your life but better now then later",
            "I don't even need to read the story, just the title, and I'm pretty sure he should be an exbf at this point. I mean, you're only 25...there are so many better opportunities for good relationships out there.",
            "I say break up, humans can't love more than one person at a time. we need unconditional love from the other side and even though we may love the other we shouldn't accept weaknesses like these. If you really love him, you shouldn't let him reminisce his past heartbreaks freely... you deserve better",
            "I would always be wondering if he\u2019s thinking of his ex every time you were both intimate.",
            "Did he say he was still in love with her? Or that what he saw hurt him/her presence hurts him? I think that is two very different things. Either way, a sober talk about this would be best.",
            "Honestly - sometimes I miss my ex who was actually incredible emotionally manipulative and sometimes abusive because of his past trauma.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be with him but there were facets to him\nThat I still would want in a partner. How long did they date? If it was a while then I feel like it\u2019s a bit more understandable, and if not, not as much. \n\nTalk to him sober and make it clear that this discussion with you is inappropriate. He is allowed to have his opinion but stating it to you is not cool and comes across like he still really cares for her.",
            "I think it was just a moment of weakness, he had a emotionally charged moment and everything spilled out unfiltered.\n\nId hang on to a guy that can talk that candidly with you, he trusted you with a bucket full of his feelings.",
            "I was with my ex for 5 years. He wasn\u2019t the best boyfriend and I eventually fell out of love with him and broke up with him. Even though I ended things he still said how wanted to try and make things work. 2 months later I met someone new and I fell HARD. This guy was the one I wanted to marry. Fast forward another 6 months, in total less than a year since my ex and I had broken up, BOOM my ex is engaged. I cried. I cried A LOT. Even cried to my mom about. I hadn\u2019t thought about my ex in a year. Hadn\u2019t seen on social media so I had no idea he was dating someone let alone it be serious enough for engagement. \n\nI never wanted my ex back, heck still don\u2019t but I was still incredibly hurt even though I was desperately in love with someone else. Emotions are unpredictable so I emphasize with your ex. However, I would\u2019ve never told my my current bf about what was going on and use the words heartbroken. So I\u2019m going to ease up on your bf and say he was just being a drunk idiot. It\u2019s easy for my to say breakup with him because I\u2019m not in it and I just don\u2019t like messy when ex\u2019s get involved. Since you\u2019re clearly unsure if you want to breakup with him (you wouldn\u2019t be on here if you were sure) talk to him sober and then both of you take some time to get your feelings together.",
            "He saw an ex, was super drunk, and got upset.\n\nListen, it's dumb that he called you to say this, but you can't fault him for having emotion. He felt what he felt and you should never be punished for how you feel.\n\nTalk to him when he's sober and ask what's up.\n\nAlso, keep this in mind: he called **you**. He was drunk, upset, and you were the first person he wanted to talk to about it. Him venting, especially about this, is him breaking that wall that divides \"partner\" and \"friend\", which is only a good thing.",
            "I don't think this is necessarily a disaster. He saw his ex... and the first thing he did was to call you. He's been honest to his own detriment. So definitely have another talk when he's sober but to me this doesn't seem like something to break up over on the surface.",
            "I can totally understand how you feel, I also had a experience very similar to yours. \nBut I would say everyone has a past and with every meaningful relationship come some unforgettable memories. \nI think it is also good that in this situation, (which probably seemed more dramatic because of the alcohol) he thought of calling you and sharing his doubts with you. \nI have the feeling that telling you right away is a very honest thing to do and is a good sign regarding how much you trust each other. \n\nI would talk with him under normal/sober conditions to see how much this will affect your relationship. \nI believe that trust and truth is so important and it seems you guys really have that <3 \n\nI grew a lot in my past relationship, it for sure impacted my life for ever and I am grateful for the experience but it wasn\u2019t right and my ex and I accepted that. \nBut I can imagine that it is possible to have moved on and still feel nostalgic at some point. \n\nHope you two can figure it out together \nAll the best <3",
            "Gonna play devils advocate here, but it is true that some people don't have that disconnect from 'moving on' like others do. They might say they've moved on and obviously your boyfriend is with you and it would seem he's over his ex, however people are not that simple. There's a certain type of person that can love two, three, four people at once. It's not wrong per say, but it certianly isn't cohesive to a meaningful relationship with ONE person.\n\nHe may be crazy for her too, filled with jealously and lashed out emotionally in the moment. I don't think it's the end of the world, but I do think that this level of behaviour would suggest there's a mild obbsession with the way things were in his head, which is a much larger problem and you should get out if that's the case.  \n\n\nI'd have a real sober chat with him, if you love him then I would see where it goes, but be skeptical.",
            "You're on r/relationship\n\nAlmost every advice you will see is \"break up with him\"\n\nAsk somewhere else that will give you the knowledge and wisdom to face minor issues like these without using self-destructive and lazy solutions r/relationship dwellers will give you. Seriously, mature a bit and think about your ex's you still have a soft spot for. Everyone still thinks about their ex's from time to time.",
            "Not worth a breakup up IMO but he's got some splainin to do. He should commit to avoiding one of the 3 mistakes he made. Getting that drunk, talking to his ex, or going to that particular club.",
            "His memories of experiences and emotions will not suddenly disappear. He called you to talk to you. He's with you. There will always be moments for all of us who truly loved another then lost them regardless of the reason they are gone. This isn't a slight against you. He's human. I imagine he probably felt like it was the day after the break-up and she was probably the last person on Earth he wanted to see to begin with.\n\nHave a talk with him sober and give him a chance to share his side. I don't know how things ended with her, but when there isn't proper closure the wounds can come tearing apart at any time. It's not like you'll never be as good as her, in fact, it's more than likely he thinks more highly of you than her and he's still having a hard time processing what happened between the two of them. Adding alcohol to the mix didn't help his resolve, but it did show that he would still call and communicate with you. If he really did have a thing for her, would he go out of his way to make you aware of it? He's in a different country, completely away from any way for you to ever find out about it, and he still told you.\n\nI agree you two need to talk, and this is a major thing you need to talk about. But give both him and yourself the chance to talk. Afterwards, you can better make your decision. But if at the end of the day you really can't stomach it then it really is time to end it. Just make sure you're not letting a temporary emotion make a permanent decision first.",
            "I called them break up relapses. You might be pretty over someone but something triggers you and the emotions of the break up just hit you like a blast from the past. I remember my current partner told me when he had one early on in our relationship. I was glad he trusted me and our relationship enough to be open about his feelings at the time. I experienced a lot of break up relapses from my previous relationship when we were first together as well so I was able to understand where he was coming from. But if you've never experienced it I could totally understand how it could seem very hurtful and threatening to your relationship. \nI don't know what it implies regarding your bf, but we both got over our exes eventually and we're happily engaged now. Just saying that is one possibility. But keep your guard up and the communication open for awhile.",
            "You can be still heartbroken over a person whilst also being in love with another. It's not even that unusual.   \n\nHonestly I think that if your first reaction is to consider breaking up with him then I'm gonna guess this relationship has other issues going on, whether you know it consciously or not.   \n\nSo here's my advice; don't overthink and don't bother looking for excuses or justifications one way or the other, just find what outcome you really want and go for it.",
            ">Only to find out that his ex moved on too quick and her presence still hurts him.    \n\nMy ex-girlfriend and I broke up two years ago when I was overseas and because of the circumstances I never fully got closure. It doesn't matter to me most of the year because I live a couple of hours away. But when I'm visiting my parents there is a high chance I run into her at an event and I get mixed feelings.    \n\n>One year has gone to waste. Feeling really hurt. At this point I feel like breaking up with him is the only solution. You really can't be with someone who hasn't moved on. I really do love him very much but it's really hurts knowing that he still loves his ex. What do I do?    \n\nTalk to your boyfriend, tell him you're hurt and ask if sober him hasn't moved on.",
            "He called a friend, he trusted you with his feelings. Are you really going to break up with him for being able to care about people and have the balls to trust you with the feelings. The world hurts feeling, together we heal.",
            "Most likely, it's just hurt pride. At least that's what I'm thinking (as a guy).\n\nIf I called my SO about it, even when drunk, it means I want to confide in her and not hide anything from her, especially this. Definitely hurts your pride to know that you've been replaced so quickly, perhaps even way before that if the ex was already mulling about who to move on with.\n\nBut then again, this is something that can be easily misconstrued as still having feelings for the ex (it can even be misunderstood as still loving the ex, if you are not careful with it and given his drunken state, he most likely has not been careful about his words).\n\nBottom line, OP needs to chill first and talk with BF once he's sober.",
            "this is probably his ego being hurt, pretty normal. but, even thou, talk to him to really understand what's going on",
            "Drunk people have been known to cry about cookies. I'm not sure if him being heartbroken over his ex moving on while drunk is an accurate representation of how he feels sober. \n\nI had a boyfriend who came home all dunk and upset because he had helped his ex move a bunch of stuff out of the place they used to share, including her wedding dress that she  never got to use. He was upset because they spent so long together, and now she was gone. She was horrible to him, but that was years of his life and I'm sure they had good times too. He was completely devoted to me, and just needed to be upset about something while drunk and that was it. \n\nI think you should ask him if he's okay. He might not even remember the conversation. If it really bothers you, then this is something that might break your relationship. But I don't think it's a problem.",
            "I feel like the fact he called you about it to confide in you about how he was feeling, even though those feelings are about an ex, shows that he really trusts you and wants to communicate openly with you. It may not have been the ideal thing to do while drunk, but speak with him while sober about it and you might gain new perspective.",
            "You should definitely talk to him when he's sober. It's normal for emotions to be heightened when you're drunk. And it would be a lot to see an ex unexpectedly. Also, I cry when I'm really drunk. I will find any reason to cry. I once cried because my friend was so tall, and it was unfair.",
            "I think you should focus on how safe he must have felt with you to talk honestly about his feelings.\n\nThey are normal feelings, especially while drunk.\n\nAnd he didn't try to hide them. He trusted that you were a safe person for him to talk to about them while drunk.\n\nThat's everything.\n\nLet him know it bothered you, but bear in mind that your story around him revealing his feelings is just YOUR story, not his. For him it might be a way of showing how much he trusts you to care about him, and how safe he can feel sharing how he feels with you without judgment or reprisal.\n\nThere is good here. Reasons to trust. Reasons to give him the benefit of the doubt. And reasons that if talked about in the right way, to believe that likewise he will help you with YOUR feelings of jealousy if you don't BLAME him for those feelings.\n\nNo one is responsible for how we feel. Our feelings come from our brain and mind. Unless you think he believed he would hurt you by talking about his feelings, the fact that he didn't make his feelings about his ex about his feelings about you is just an example of you believing your feelings about each other are more important than any past relationship.\n\nBut it's our past relationships that form the framework for what makes our current relationships work. I can feel bad about seeing an ex that I cared deeply about. It's not like those feelings disappear. It's just that other feelings are a part of that relationship which make how I feel more complicated than the fact that I care about them. I can love, and not trust someone, and that is a good reason to end the relationship. And it would make sense why I might be sad upon seeing them while still being happy that I am with someone whom I both love AND trust.\n\nOur feelings don't go away. They may get complicated, but they don't vanish. I'm sure it's the same for you. If you think of your exes, you feel the same way regarding what you have always liked about them... But there are so just a whole bunch of other feelings regarding stuff you discovered while dating them that makes you happy it's over.",
            "Don\u2019t break up with home, just have a talk and express how it made you feel. More than likely he didn\u2019t process the break up emotionally (if this is the case he isn\u2019t in love with his ex) as us guys tend to push feelings down.",
            "I would call him back when he is sober and not hung over and have a chat with him. Then go from there.",
            "I agree that this is a red flag, but I would talk with him sober before deciding that it is a deal-breaker for you. Someone ending a relationship abruptly or moving on extremely fast can be so painful, even traumatizing, and you can fall in love with someone new without having ever worked through those feelings. It doesn't necessarily mean he still wants her. It might just mean he's still working through how she hurt him.\n\nI kind of relate to how your bf could be feeling. My ex, who was really toxic for me, moved on within DAYS of our breakup. After her, I dated another girl for almost two years, and I 100% loved her, no doubt about it, but I still had a lot of trust issues and unresolved anger towards my ex. I DEFINITELY didn't want my ex back though. I just had no closure. \n\nWhen someone moves on so easily or harshly, it is a huge blow to your self-worth and your ability to trust others. You become more closed down. You're constantly scared that you don't mean as much to people as they mean to you. \n\nConsidering he hasn't seen this ex in over a year, I can see how those feelings might have been triggered. He definitely has shit to work through, but it's not necessarily shit he can't work through with you, if you love each other. Definitely talk before you break up.",

It shows me that their partner cares about them and that they don\u2019t want to keep things like this under wraps and hidden away in their mind. Definitely not a situation I would like to be in in my relationship, but it\u2019s clear that this person feels they can communicate with OP and that\u2019s something that should be done on both ends, sobered up though. Talk it out, try to figure out what about their interaction triggered the emotions and what you can do to validate that persons concerns. then voice your concerns about what those emotions mean to you, and how they affected you as well. It may not fix the issue at hand but at least you\u2019ll have an open communication to see whether or not this is something you should continue with your partner.",
            "Idk, the fact he called you and told you all about it shows how deeply you two are emotionally connected and how much he trusts you. He also didn\u2019t hide it by telling his friends and not you. Sounds like he\u2019s being open and honest. I think y\u2019all could work it out",

And we hear a very abbreviated version of one side of the story, and are asked to help you to make a massive life decision.  \n\nBased on the very limited information I have, I'll say this.

            "Seeing an ex after a long time even if you have moved on can stir up feelings more so when alcohol is involved. His drunken brain probably called you because he wanted a safe person to share his feelings with. I think breaking up is taking it way way way too far. Have a convo about it when he's sober, tell him how it made you feel ask him why he felt the way he did. It's probably as simple as that. No need to go down the road of heartbreak when you don't need to",

He was drunk, which we all know does not produce the clearest thinking. It looks like he\u2019s got some shit to unpack on his own, for sure. I don\u2019t know him so I can\u2019t say whether this mans is capable of making emotional labour happen or not. Can he follow those bad feelings and really reach the crux of them? Can he make peace with them, with himself? I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s something for the two of you. \n\nOur relationships are where we intersect as two people but the lines of our existence stretch further than that, in time, in interests and also in experiences. But regardless this guy had a bad moment and the first thing he wanted to do was talk to someone he trusted and that was you. You are close to him. That\u2019s communication. Not to say it was good communication from that point, he\u2019s drunk. But communication is so much in a relationship. It not enough on its own but paired with reflection, action it creates foundation. \n\nShould you throw the whole man out? Maybe. But not necessarily.",
            "About seven months after my (current) boyfriend and I started dating, he called me drunk and in tears.  Why?  Because this day was the day he had been planning on proposing to his ex.  He was really upset about it, and more to the point, he was scared that the FACT that he was upset about it meant he was still in love with is ex and that I would 100% break up with him for that. \n\nWe ended up talking a little bit that night, and I straight up asked him if his feelings for his ex made his feelings for me any less strong.  He said no, and that that's the part that was so confusing for him...he really really liked me and was happy with me, and barely ever thought about his ex anymore.  That's why he was so upset with himself. All I did that night was promise not to break up with him until we talked in person.   We are still together and happy, and he is as over his ex as you ever are from a five-year relationship where you were planning on getting married. \n\n  *One year has gone to waste.*  Is this HIS assessment of the situation, or yours?  If he thinks the last year was a waste because he still has lingering feelings for his ex, that is the actual problem - not the feelings.  Feelings are complicated and they don't just disappear as soon as the relationship ends.  He may not still LOVE his ex, but he may have regrets, jealousy, etc.  But if HE is the one moping around feeling like his life isn't any better with you in it, then that is the real issue here.  There's a difference between having leftover emotions about an old relationship, and feeling like your current one doesn't measure up and was a \"waste of time\".  \n\nHowever, if this is YOUR assessment of the situation, you might be jumping the gun a little bit.  Emotions are tricky things, mixed with alcohol.  I would wait until he's sober and talk about it again.  How does he feel about it now that he's not drunk?  Does he still love her, or is he just upset about how it ended?  Did she do or say something to rile him up and he's mixing in feelings about their old fights?  Can he tell you that he's happy with you now and can see that they two of you are better suited for each other?   Before you jump to breaking up, give him a chance to assess his own feelings and explain them better.  If you're still not satisfied with his answers, then breaking up is the right choice.",
            " Years ago my ex-fiancee left me.  I've dated and had serious committed relationships over the last seven years but I still got emotional over hearing how he's engaged again.  I would never be with him again but sometimes people leave you wondering 'what if?' and it can be hard to get over.  That doesn't mean he's not committed or that he doesn't love you.  But take that with a grain of salt and as other comments said I'd still be wary of continuing a relationship",
            "it can be very emotional seeing your ex for the first time, I'd talk to him sober and see if it's still an issue.",
            "Gonna throw out just a tidbit of perspective. \n\nIt\u2019s obviously completely up to you but you threw out the word love. \n\nHe had a drunk emotional moment and confided in you. Which is weird but clearly he trusts and cares about you a lot. If you actually love him I think he more than deserves at least a sober conversation about this. \n\nUnless you just like him a whole bunch and can move on easily enough, then sure, leave him without some uncomfortable conversations and chances and carry on.",
            "Echoing others here saying breaking up is probably premature. It's not at all unreasonable for him to feel this way. Your year with him hasn't gone to waste. \nIt sucks that you feel hurt here. Nobody's really done anything wrong (that I can tell at least). Nobody can control what they feel, so it's unfair to take action based solely on what others have told you they are feeling.\nI think it's actually a good sign that he wanted to talk to you about this. It means you were on his mind, even though he was having an emotional experience involving his ex.  He felt comfortable enough with you to share it, even though there was a risk that you'd react poorly. Now I know he was drunk at the time, so he definitely wasn't carefully choosing his actions, but I think the simplest interpretation is that he trusts you to trust him, and that screams strong relationship to me.\nYou should talk to him about it. Ask him point blank: does he still have feelings for the ex, and are they strong enough to impact your relationship. If he still feels something, you need to decide if you're ok with that. Just keep in mind that it can take a long time for feelings to fade, and caring about someone isn't a zero sum game, so even if he still feels something for his ex, that doesn't mean he doesn't love you, and it doesn't mean he'll do anything wrong as a result.  Be open and honest, and trust that he'll do the same.",
            "Love is a funny thing. \n\nI'm curious how your relationship is otherwise. Has he shown to be emotionally connected to you, thoughtful, kind?\n\nOld relationships, especially if they were long, leave a mark, stir emotions.\n\nHis drunk comments that she moved on too quick are concerning; however, they were drunk comments.\n\nMy ex, mother of my three adult children, stirs emotions, certainly not romantic ones. Because of alimony, I would be ecstatic if she moved on. We shared a life together and so there are emotions. I refuse to replace those with hate, like so many do.\n\nAmong the many memories, even with soft feelings of compassion I have for her, her actions often remind me why I moved on, and why I am happy in my second marriage. I am friends with my ex; but deeply in love with my wife.\n\nMy point is: you should explore these feelings he expressed. Is it because still loves his ex and wants her back? Were his feelings from an unexpected meeting, he was unprepared to process while drunk? Does he love you? Does his feelings for his ex impeded on an intimate connection with you? \n\nYou may find that he is not ready to move on, still grasping at the past. Or perhaps, he can't accurately explain what it was he felt, spewed forth words in drunkenness that don't paint the whole story.\n\nEmotions communicate with complicated messages. Guys are notoriously bad at understanding them and worse at putting them to words. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest wishes in navigating the complicated world of exes. \n\n\\~Troy (Flourishing Life Society)",
            "It's totally plausible for someone to love more than one person at a time. It would be different if he constantly compared you two or ignores the reality of you for the memory of her. If she'd died instead, would you expect him to stop loving her?\n\nI think your best bet here is to have a sober conversation with him. Ask him how he feels, what you are to him, and if he sees you two as being together long term. Set relationship expectations together. Set boundaries. This relationship isn't a waste just because there's a scar from an old wound.",

Suddenly everyone is a scholar about the inner workings of the human mind.\n\nThere have been cases of people laughing hysterically at their own parents funeral. Sometimes feelings are feelings and they don't make any logical sense. \n\nOne thing is for certain though. Unresolved feelings and even full blown mental illness can begin by not having an outlet to discuss them, and letting them manifest. Telling yourself you don't have them doesn't make them go away. They will be back sooner or later.",

            "Hey OP, I want to bring another perspective to you to consider.  Fair warning my response is rather long because I want to provide context.  I am in a loving relationship with my current boyfriend for a little shy of 2 years and this is by far the most loving and accepting relationship I\u2019ve ever been in.  I was with my ex for 6 years and he moved on quickly afterwards as well and I\u2019m still recovering from it and it\u2019s been 2.5 years.  My boyfriend was also with his ex for 6 years.  Even 2.5 years later, both of us still have days where we break down and feel overwhelmed with feelings of sadness, loss, hurt, and inadequacy because of our own backstories (which are very different than the other\u2019s).  Emotion is a complex thing and as you get older you\u2019ll realize that humans are capable of hold dichotomies  and emotion is rarely back and white.  You can certainly feel love (not romantic) and hurt towards someone who have wronged you in someway and not wanting to be with them, you can certainly be perfectly happy in your current relationship and still mourn for the loss of your past relationships.  These are normal emotions and often people try to make everything so black and white that it suffocates the complexities we are capable of experiencing as humans.  Just a couple weeks ago both my boyfriend and I had dreams about our exes and we were down the whole day in our own silos and it wasn\u2019t until we engaged in a dialogue where we placed no judgment but embraced each other\u2019s pain in understanding and loving support that we bonded deeper.  A healthy relationship allows for sharing of pain with openness and honesty, not jumping into conclusions straight away.  Sometimes people are hurting, especially men, who are often shaped by society to hide their feelings, that causes years of loneliness and depression.  He trusted in you to share his pain, and I would encourage you to at least listen and have a conversation to understand his pain before deciding whether you want to continue this relationship or not.  Yes, these conversations are extremely scary and can rock the very foundation of the relationship, but to play devil\u2019s advocate, if you were seriously hurt by an ex and you shared your feelings with your boyfriend, what reaction would you want from him if the goal is to have a loving relationship where you are building towards something together?  Now if this isn\u2019t your goal then that\u2019s a different story, but please have some compassion for him if you truly love him.  We all go through tough times, we all have waves of loss and pain that hits us over and over about the same things.  I\u2019m over my ex and my precious relationship but the pain can take years to fully heal.  Best of luck OP.",
            "Getting drunk and having an existential crisis about what your life could have been, while upsetting on your end, doesn't necessarily mean that he's not over her or that he's unhappy with you. I'm perfectly happy with my life but after one too many I can get glum about the way things could have gone, not because I'm unhappy but just because it's in our nature to always want what we can't have.\n\nI'd say the fact that he called you up is actually a pretty reassuring sign. He was drunk, and sad, and you were the person he turned to. Heartbroken and horny aren't the same thing and it's easy to see an ex and be hurt that they don't want you and found someone better than You in their eyes without wanting to get back with that ex yourself.\n\nObviously it's all in the details, have a sober chat, i wouldn't run too soon.",
            "Just wanna point out that still being hurt over a past relationship does not mean you're still in love with your ex. For instance, I know a guy who is currently in a 3 year relationship with an amazing girl with whom they have an incredible, mutually respectful relationship, but he can't even bring himself to look at pictures of his ex, let alone be in the same room as her. Doesn't mean he still loves her, means that certain wounds take more time to heal.\n\nAlso, being hurt at the idea of your ex moving on too quickly is a very natural feeling. It makes you feel insignificant. It doesn't necessarily go to the idea of love, it goes to your ego and sense of self-worth.\n\nI think your boyfriend's feelings are valid, but there's also room for suspicion considering it has been over a year. The whole \"one year has gone to waste\" line is particularly alarming too, not sure what it exactly means but it warrants an explanation. Have a talk with him the next day when his hangover clears up.",
            "He called you and was HONEST..I COMMEND THAT.. He could've chosen other options but he turned to you..hope you push past your feelings and just encourage that he trusted you to get him...",
            "How harsh. \"I love him so much\" but then you want to break over one drunk moment?\nHere in Italy we say that you have 3 types of drunkenness: Happy/Stupid, Sad and Sleepy. The Happy/Stupid is when you feel overconfident, hug friends and total strangers but you might end into trouble, sad is the most annoying for friends (I had a friend that started crying because his doggie \"Cookie\" died when he was 8 and all he could remember were his sad moments...) and sleepy drunkenness where you're just sleepy and ooze off to collapse somewhere to sleep.\n\nWhat can I say? Loving one another is not being always happy, being 100% ok and having no issues at all. It's growing up with someone different than you. That might argue, fight over different point of views, moments of tensed silents and then being there for the moments of weakness of each other. If at the first issues you break up what does that mean of your feelings? Just because your ego got hurt over him being upset that his ex moved on? That was his ego talking not his heart! \n\nBut yes. Ask here on Reddit to see how you should behave. Just to appease your consciousness. \n\nOr maybe, start growing up emotionally and mature a little bit. There will be other issues along the way. Far worse than one stupid drunk moment. Maybe talking to your bf why is it necessary to get drunk when he's out with his friends and advising him that he's the Sad/Annoying type of drunk. \nAsk him if he drove home or if he was taken home. More life threatening issues than ex girlfriend. and btw he didn't say he wanted to be with her. He just said he was sad she moved on too quickly. Translation: \"I thought I have made a bigger impact in her life and she would be crushed for a longer period of time\"  that's all.\n\nCheers and sorry for the harsh tone.",
            "I wouldn\u2019t break up with him yet but I would voice with him how it makes you feel as he may not realise the inpact it has on you. Points to him for being honest and upfront but you need to tell him to move on and cut all ties/memories of his ex. Everyone processes seperations in different ways but accepting the situation and moving on is critical to find peace in life.He\u2019s lost something good in order to gain something great which is you ;) Cut him some slack and attempt to navigate through it. If it doesn\u2019t work tell him that you\u2019ve been left with no choice but to end the relationship. This might shock him into realising what he\u2019s done is not ok.

            "I'd say alcohol is definitely a factor here. Wait til he's sober to really get to the bottom of this.

In my opinion, he came to you because you're a place of trust and comfort and he felt safe sharing that info with you.\n\nYou need to have a sober chat with him. If you still see this as a red flag afterward, you are entirely justified to break up with him. Or you may find 9ut that it was a big drama over nothing.

How soon after their breakup did you two start dating?\n\nI\u2019m not saying he still loves her and should have permission to have deep feelings for her still, but having feelings is part of being human.  Seeing your ex out may make anyone feel a little weird, especially when alcohol is involved.\n\nTrust that he loves you and talk to him when you\u2019re both sober to get a better understanding of where his head is at.  Try to avoid making assumptions about things until you talk.\n\nI\u2019m dating someone that was married for years.  We dated soon after they divorced.  We have run into his ex a few times and I can tell it makes him a little uneasy, however I have no doubt he loves me and wants to be with me.  I think that love and trust component is the glue that holds us together, so maybe also evaluate if you feel secure and loved in your relationship too, as that will help you weather difficult experiences.",
            "I think after a year you can give him the benefit of the doubt. He might not have dealt with the feels from his last relationship and it's possible he wants your help.\n\nSeeing an ex move on feels terrible for any number of reasons. You might be able to figure out what those reasons are as a couple and put them out there for you both to understand.\n\nLikewise you should be able to articulate together why it triggered such a response in you. What is this idea of wasted time? What are your expectations? Why is a break up the only solution?\n\nIf you come to a point of mutual understanding with compassion, you will be in a much better place even if you end up splitting. And if you stay together, well, it can be very nice to have the kind of relationship where you deal with issues together rather than separately. Good luck!",
            "Seeing the ex while drunk brought up sag thoughts of the past and her moving on soon after their break up means she was cheating or he was easy  to get over which possibly hurt his pride... I wouldn't read into it TO MUCH into it without a sober chat",
            "I can see how you\u2019d be hurt, but the flip side is he felt comfortable enough to say that to you.

            "I feel for the SO. We aren't given a lot of context as to how the Ex and him broke up. If the SO didnt get closure or the argument brought up old wounds, I can see why he'd be drunk upset. Then he needed support and someone to vent to, which he turned to you. I would be a little hurt obviously but glad my BF trusted me with those feelings rather than bottle them away or me find out through someone else. Maybe it's because I had my own baggage that I can connect with him that my own SO helped me through. I made it clear though that I no longer had feelings FOR my Ex, but that I had these feelings and issues BECAUSE of the Ex. \n\nI would definitely recommend a sober convo but this isn't something you should automatically break up with them for. Don't punish them for coming to you with something that's bothering them. Now if it turns out he does still have feelings that's a whole 'nother issue and I don't have any advice for that.

He might very well still have a few residual feels for the ex that have gone unexamined, but that does NOT mean he has been fooling you into believing he loves you when he does not. People can most certainly love fully and wholly one person while also still having feelings for another... it is not always a zero sum game. However YOU have to decide whether or not something like that would ever sit well with you (assuming that turns out to be the case here... it may very well not be). If jealousy is something you have a hard time sitting with, then that might drive a real wedge here.\n\nAt the end of the day, only YOU know what type of partner he has been to you prior to this event.

Here's what happened. \n\nThe evening after I made that post, I told my husband there is no way we will be able to work everything out on our own, and we need to go to counseling. He reluctantly agreed. \n\nWe started couples counseling the very next week. It's realy quite strange how counseling has progressed. \n\n1. My husband made one change - stopping with the yelling - immediately and totally. He hasn't yelled at me over little things for weeks now. \n\n2. BUT I have progressively gotten more and more angry with, disappointed in, and disconnected from him because of everything he's said and done during these weeks in counseling.... which also caused me to sort of wake up to all that he has done in the past. I have an appointment with a lawyer next week. We are done. \n\n\\#2 takes a bit of explanation, so here goes. \n\nI am quite stunned by how little effort this guy is willing to put into the relationship in spite of so desperately wanting to hold on to it. So he made one change - the end of all yelling. I was really, really relieved and grateful and impressed.... until he started complaining (about 4 days in!) that he was putting in all the effort and seeing \"negative returns\". This has remained his stance for all these 10-11 weeks. \n\nI am flabbergasted. Our couples counselor has straight up said to him: \"I am supposed to be neutral here but on this I am comfortable saying you are WRONG, she is making a huge effort at this relationship and you need to know that.\" But in private my husband dismisses everything I'm doing as \"intangible\" or \"selfish\" and therefore not real. And he complains nonstop that I'm not my \"usual self\" i.e. the doormat who danced around managing his feelings and walking on eggshells all the time. \"This is not the person I fell in love with,\" he keeps saying. \"Why should I bother making all this effort?\" \n\n\nFor my part, yes, I am not the person he fell in love with. The couples counselor told me to stop trying to manage his feelings for him and try to be myself - and I took that very seriously. I no longer try to read his mood all the time and tiptoe around him. I no longer try to intuit when he is angry or hurt and ask him what's wrong and try to cajole him into working things out. I leave it to him to bring it up with me if something is bothering him. If he's in a bad mood and sulking, I just leave him alone and go on with my own thing until he wants to talk. If he is stonewalling me, which he has started doing for a few days after every single counseling session, I no longer let it affect my mood. This seems to be making him feel completely unloved and abandoned - which I only know because he has broken down and cried and yelled at me after the stonewall. \"You don't care about me anymore.\" And I've been saying, \"If something is bothering you, you need to tell me. I won't read your mind. And I won't cave to your freezeouts.\" Cue his standard line, \"What effort are you making in this relationship? Why am I the only one who's doing anything here? Why should I continue to do this work when you are being so selfish?\" \n\nThe stoppage of yelling was homework from the very first session. He did that. But subsequent sessions' homework has been things like, \"Go on a date this week\" and \"Make one show of affection as soon as you're home from work\" and \"Make time for conversation before bedtime\" etc. -- all of which have been spectacular failures. On our \"date\" he refused to so much as hold my hand and spent all his time wandering off on his own (we were at a museum) - and when I brought it up later he got massively pissed saying \"WE WENT ON A DATE WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT\".  The  show of affection - well, he used to do it if he came home later than me, but if I come home from work later than him, he is always distracted and does not reciprocate my hug *even after I point it out*, and now since he started stonewalling me for days after each counseling session, I haven't even tried to do this homework because fuck it, who wants to hug a stonewaller (same goes for conversation before bedtime). \n\nThis shit has really woken me up, y'all. I don't know what sort of fantasy I had constructed out of whole cloth that made me love this guy. He really doesn't want to lift a finger. He seems to lose it completely at the thought of my leaving - cries, seems desperate - but it translates into ZERO action. He really doesn't care about me at all. \n\nAnyway - I said as much to him early this week and told him I am leaving. Next week I have an appointment with an attorney to see what my options are. This shit is really happening. I am leaving. I am scared as shit and my emotions are fucking fried but I have never been more sure of anything. \n\n \n  ---   \n\n\n  **tl;dr**: 10 weeks of actually talking about our relationship for the first time in 11 years - that's all it took to wake me up to the reality that I married a ridiculously selfish man. Fuck. :(\n",

His actions are pretty damning. \n\n> I am scared as shit and my emotions are fucking fried\n\nFrankly, I would recommend you reaching out to a domestic violence shelter and seek advice on how you should go about separating from him.

His behavior got really scary. \n\nHis wife told him he was in the wrong. His family told him he was in the wrong. His best friend told him he was in the wrong.  Their counselor told him he was in the wrong. And all he could do was cry that \"no one was on his side.\"\n\nYour husband doesn't want to repair your marriage or have a good relationship.

You know how much better you feel now that you're not trying to tiptoe around your husband and are just leaving him to deal with his own emotional bullshit instead of doing it for him? You're going to feel even better once the emotional bullshit is out of your life entirely.

Please continue with counseling so that you learn to recognize what aspects of your upbringing and personality made you marry a guy like your husband. We are all motivated by aspects of our personalities that we might not be conscious of. My wife and I have been married 33 years and feel lucky that we've had good communication and we both feel that we married our \"best friends\". My point in bringing that up is to say you can find that too. Things will get better, stick to your principles and hang in there.",

I am a very self blaming person so my anger turned inwards - how could I be so stupid? Etc - but of course I'm not you. Nonetheless I wanted to share because you might find yourself overwhelmed with relief at the same time as anger or disappointment in yourself or others. I had and still have trouble trusting my own instincts now because i was so shaken to learn I'd let myself be abused for half a decade and that she had convinced me of all these negative things about myself, some of which are literally the opposite of the truth.\n\nCongratulations on standing up for yourself and for leaving.

My mom and I sat down and made plans to get some board games, that are 2 player+, so we can all play together, even if someone is out of the house. She is also considering picking out some video games that interest her so she can learn the system, and is open to trying my games out as well. My stepdad and I have been individually hanging out with her on her time off. \n\nI wanted to also follow up on a question I received on my previous post about if she was truly feeling left out: I could tell just by her demeanor that she was a bit distant during the time that my stepdad and I played games together. But also, I think I may have been projecting my own feelings and maybe making the situation worse than it was, since I will never know how she truly felt. This question really made me think about the deeper aspect to the situation, and as I said before, my mom is my best friend. I came to realize that I was also feeling a bit disconnected from her and missing her presence. It\u2019s perfectly fine to have our own hobbies individually but in this case I think there was just prolonged isolation that led to insecurity, from my own side at least.\n\nI can\u2019t say that the situation is perfect and resolved yet but there is definitely progress being made! And that is relieving. I\u2019m excited to have these future bonding times as a whole. \nThank you to everyone who weighed in and took time out of their day to help me out. It truly means a lot. \n\nTLDR; We made plans to hang out together more. Thank you.",

            "Great update!\n\nIf you find that your mother isn't really tapping into the game thing, consider trying games with cute/whimsical imagery, like the Lego ones or Carnival Games. I'm around her age, and hyper realistic games weren't a thing when I was a teen (the technology to support it didn't exist). A lot of our games had a \"cute\" aesthetic. I still much prefer those games to modern mainstream stuff. \n\nThe other thing is, it may take her a while to wrap her head around a not-completely-linear playing style (exploring rather than a set progression). Old-style gaming from our youth was very linear - apart from anything else there wasn't necessarily the processor power to support multiple elaborate pathways. You may need to actually explain that's how it works, because if you're expecting a linear play style, it isn't immediately obvious.",
            "Cool! /r/boardgames is a great place for good game recommendations. It is a huge hobby right now and there are tons of great games out there.\n\n(If you are looking for only 2p I highly recommend Patchwork - it's pretty cheap, easy to play and has a lot of depth)",
            "Definitely check out /r/boardgames for some ideas. I'd take a look at some cooperative games like Forbidden Island or Pandemic; it is easier getting people into the hobby if you're all winning together rather than one person just demolishing the rest. Also, look for games with minimal setup and playtime so you don't have to commit to a multi-hour session every time.",

            "I highly recommend trying out some cooperative or conversation generating board games!  Hogwarts Battle is one of my favorites and is a good gateway game as it builds in complexity as you play the year campaigns and teaches some good basic gaming skills, and if the goal is quality time together, the cooperative nature lets that be the main focus. \n\nDixit is another favorite. It\u2019s technically competitive, but ends up being more about getting to know how the other players think and it can lead to some really interesting conversations about why someone chose a particular word when describing a card.",
            "I commented elsewhere about game recommendations, but also wanted to recommend maybe you and stepdad also participating in one of her hobbies?  \n\nIt might be a nice gesture, plus you might enjoy it as well.    :)",
            "You should get Untitled Goose Game!! It's really approachable for people who know nothing about games and fun to watch in case she's too nervous to hold the controller.\n\nI also recommend Gizmos for a board game - it's 2+ players and involves enough strategy that it's fun for board game experts, but enough luck that it's possible to win for novices. \n\nI'm so glad you've reached out! Your family sounds really sweet :)",

It's been pretty rough the last year so ive grown very distant from my mom and my step dad. It makes me sad, but ive been trying to hangout with them more. I feel very bad for my little sister as well, because she is only 10 years old but I believe she gets lonely when i am gone. Thank you for this post. It may not seem like much to you but i appreciate it dearly. Hsve fun playing board games and video games.",

            "Stardew and lovers in an dangerous space time! I love Lovers it is so much fun. People who are more gamer experienced and do the more difficult parts and those who are not can do easier things. My SO and I have played with his mom and grandma and he would control and I would do most of the shooting. \n\nAlso, Mario party, I think it's Kriby Adventure. Those are all up to 4 players. \n\nBoard games, we love Gloomhaven, DnD board games. Although those can be difficult if you don't have basic game understanding I think. Exploding Kittens is hilarious and super easy for those who don't have game understanding, it is a card game though. Also, just playing cards can be fun too. My SO and I do this every Christmas with his Gandpa, Mom and Grandma.\n\nSo exciting she is willing to try!",

Its a little complex but super fun- its rather short, about 30 min but you can get expansions for it to make it longer.

It was one of the only games she could get to grips with but she felt so accomplished whenever we won a fight or completed a puzzle (she has MS so I was worried her motor skills would have been affected with the controller). It was fun and it's a nice way to bond and make memories. \n\nI keep seeing Statdew Valley recommendations, I'll have to think about introducing it to her sometime.",

For one that\u2019s visually stunning try Breath Of The Wild. It\u2019s gorgeous and peaceful.

            "My partner and his sons are all gamers. I being a 45f was not but I wanted to join in the fun so I played Red Dead Redemption and GTAV. A lot of fun. Now I am playing Skyrim. But we also play a lot of board games, dice or cards - Smash Up, Exploding Kittens, Nefarious, euchre etc. I am not into watching sports on tv but his one son is so I try to ask questions about his teams, playoffs etc. Sometimes it is hard to connect when you don't have common interests but each side has to make an effort. It is so sweet that you are making an effort.",
            "I love that you're reconnecting with your mom and including her! I'm a big board game person and I really like Patchwork as a simple, two player game. My boyfriend and I also really love playing Watergate (2 player game where one person is Nixon, the other the Washington Post during the scandal), it's really fun but can get a bit competitive. But, Last Christmas we brought a bunch of board games down to visit my parents and my mom really loved playing Happy Pigs, it's a cute game where you're trying to raise animals and grow your farm. She acted like she didn't know what she was doing, but she was able to apply her real world skills (owning and growing her own business) to the game and had an absolute blast destroying us! It is requested for every visit now :) Hope you find an activity that you can enjoy together!",
            "I have a similar family set up with video games and my mum isn't as into them so to ease her into playing then I got her playing beyond 2 souls. I know it's a one player but the controls are basic, in game combat it tells you exactly what to press on the screen and with dialogue choices everyone can be a part of it and it's kind of like watching a movie. Since then she's been getting into tell-tale games, again just dialogue choices and simple buttons. Some triva games got her used to where the buttons are on the controller. Recently I went to visit, her and my step-dad are going to play Spiderman she loves puzzles and he likes combat, they both want to web shoot around.\n\nMy little brother got them playing Lego games, Minecraft etc and most recently they both joined me and my brother playing screencheat which was a chore to teach but fun once they got the hang of it.",

            "\"Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime\" is a great game for people who are not gamers and hardcore gamers.  Up to 4 people play at the same time on one console, so you can all sit together.  You control your own little dudes but cooperate to manage a space ship.  There are different stations around the ship like engine room, shield room, gun room, etc.  You can only control one station at a time yourself, so you have to talk and work together.  It is very cute, too, and not scary or violent.",

It changes the level at what makes you happy, instead of seeing a pretty flower or butterfly and feeling happy, it no longer does.  Use with caution and limit how much you are playing. Are you paying for hours with your stepdad? If so than you are definitely isolating everyone and I doubt it's real quality time with your stepdad.  I would put a timer on.  Play one hour then shut the damn thing off!  I get real annoyed with my brother in law who loves gaming but when he's here, he goes in the back room and plays, I don't know why he bothers,  it's like he's not even here.",

I found her on Instagram through some miracle, and I requested to follow her, which she accepted. It\u2019s not much of an update, but she is interesting! She dyes her hair pink and blue. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s actually like, to be honest. Is she nice? Is she nasty? I couldn\u2019t ever tell.\n\nI can\u2019t find my brother. I don\u2019t know how to spell his name.\n\nI feel guilty. I\u2019ll admit, a big reason why I found her is because I feel guilty. I get to have my dad. All the Father\u2019s Days go to me, she gets nothing. He left her when she was 1. \n\nIs it bad to say I resent him for it? I\u2019ll bet she does. I love him, but honestly? He doesn\u2019t deserve a Father\u2019s Day. He abandoned his role as a dad to two people.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to dish out your love accordingly.

But you were more of a dad to me than you were to those two combined. Do you think seeing them once a year is gonna compensate? A lonely card on their birthday with some money in?\n\nWhatever, I might try to strike up a conversation with her soon but we\u2019ll see. \n\n**TL;DR - I found my sister on Instagram and I\u2019m starting to resent my dad for leaving her.**",

            "My story is very similar to yours, only I would be the forgotten sister in this situation. I think it's sweet that you are empathizing with your siblings situation. My dad straight up deleted me out of his life once he found a new family when I was about 7 years old. He never talked to me again after that. I have a lot of emotional damage from the situation, but my life turned out good regardless. I think it would be nice of you to reach out to your sister. It's ok to love your dad, because he was good to you, while also losing some respect for him not contacting his other kids. Adults aren't perfect and sometimes they make wrong choices. But we can still love them regardless. Good luck.",
            "Good luck, and I hope you two connect! The slow approach sounds like a good one, ease into it by letting her know you're around and interested in her, and start a convo over a post you relate to at the right time later and hopefully build on that. Keep us updated!",
            "My Dad wasn\u2019t quite as bad, but he did cheat on my mother and eventually left her and was a pretty poor parent after. He married my step mother (as far as I know he didn\u2019t cheat on my mother with her) and helped raise her two children instead. I completely understand the feeling. He complained about child support and refused to do anything he wasn\u2019t legally obligated to do. I remember it was in the divorce decree that he\u2019d cover medical and he refused to buy my brother braces he desperately needed. I do not resent either of my step siblings. I also do not know them because it was obvious when we were around that my Dad and step mother didn\u2019t care about us. \n\nI wish you the best of luck.",
            "You should definitely strike up a conversation. I come from the other side of the story, albeit a bit different. My dad left me and my sister (early 30s now) when we were 9 and 11. He had a new woman he was cheating with. They eventually had a kid when I was 13, and she brought her son (then 5) from a past relationship. I tried to be \"mature\" and come over sometimes but my stepmom hated me and my sister and made it very clear. My dad didn't really care, he had no interest in being a parent and was fine just taking my sister and I for dinner now and then. Eventually when I was in my early 20s I just cut them off. I was sick of my stepmom talking shit about me to my face and my dad just watching. My siblings were in their teens and we basically had no relationship because they were so much younger. \n\nNow, I'm in my early 30s and they're 20 and 25. I started messaging them in a group chat on insta with my other sister and it's actually been fun to get to know them. We have done games nights and gone for lunch etc. I don't blame them for what happened, they were little kids and their mom loves them and it isn't their fault our dad is a cheater and their mom was mean to my sister and I. I just woke up one day and realized that one day our parents will be gone. This is my sister, and step-brother. I wanted to know them as people regardless of the past. I'm the oldest, so I took it upon myself to get the ball rolling. You and your sister are closer in age so I think it would be very kind and mature of you to reach out because she's the one who was hurt most here. Good luck!!! \ud83e\udd70",

You aren\u2019t responsible to protect or explain your parents, and your role isn\u2019t to be an intermediary between them. It\u2019s just to be her sister.",

            "This might not be the most popular answer. I was in your situation. I honestly didn't know what to do when I actually found out, because I had an amazing childhood with two loving parents that were (and still are) madly in love. It was hard to believe that they had this whole other life and that one marriage was ruined so they could be together.\n\nI actually requested to my mom that I needed to find a therapist to talk to about it. Which was very helpful. And I did reach out via social media to the sibling in question. It wasn't really awkward at all. Although I did hear some things about them resenting the family unit that they wished they had. It was super sad and I realized how lucky I was. However, it was a stepping stone to a relationship. After we hashed it out we started to make an effort to communicate more often. Eventually we both became adults and the relationship was just easy. My parents didn't have other children so I'm happy that I have a sibling. We don't really talk much about the past and enjoy our relationship as it is. \n\nAs for my parents. I came to terms with it. You will as the time goes on. I can't speak for my sibling obviously, but my shock and resentment faded. Possibly because I did have two awesome and loving parents. I would definitely recommend talking your feelings out with a therapist. It was very helpful to me.",

I don\u2019t have any real advice but maybe talk to your dad about it too and see if there\u2019s more to the story because it all is a little weird, granted it\u2019s a weird situation to begin with. \n\nIf you want to reach out I\u2019d encourage you to. Worst case scenario she doesn\u2019t really try to have a relationship. Mine reached out to me but we don\u2019t really talk a ton bc of distance and age difference but it\u2019s nice seeing good stuff she posts on social media and semi seeing some of her life. \n\nAnyways I hope all is okay for you!

            "I don\u2019t know if my story will help you, but I think there is a (very slight) possibility that this might not be 100% on your dad. My father cheated on my mother. It was wrong, and it destroyed their marriage. They had joint custody of us for the first year after or so, and then I didn\u2019t see my dad regularly until I was 17 (they split when I was 8). My older sister and I tracked him down and confronted him for abandoning us. It\u2019s worth noting that my mother and my stepfather were and are extremely abusive, and my sister and I blamed him for leaving us in that situation. As it turns out, the reason he stopped seeing us regularly is because my mother told him we cried every time we came home from his house, that we hated it there and hated spending time with him and didn\u2019t want to go anymore. He believed her, and didn\u2019t want to put us through more pain after watching our parents split up, so he stepped back. He sent cards and came to birthday parties, but we didn\u2019t stay at his house or go places with him. Obviously, it wasn\u2019t right for him to stop seeing us, even if we had been complaining about it. We were 9 and 11 years old, and we shouldn\u2019t have been trusted with that decision. But my mother also shares a lot of the blame. She lied about and manipulated her own children in order to hurt her ex husband, and we were the ones who lost out.\n\nI am not blaming your dad\u2019s ex wife. But you said yourself that she hated your mom and your family, and I\u2019ve met a lot of people with parents like mine who had one parent poison them against the other. Your parents made a bad decision, but unless you know for a fact that your dad willfully abandoned your sister, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily fair to dump all of the blame on him. There are three adults involved in this situation, and it kind of looks like none of them are blameless.",

            "It sounds like from your old post it was the mom who poisoned the relationship. That your dad had tried to keep her in his life. \n\nA bad marriage takes both people, it\u2019s not his fault or hers or even your moms, it\u2019s a collective fault. Situations like this occur because their is already a problem. Nobody really knows what all went on except for your dad and his first wife. Not even your mom will ever know the full Story.",
            "Have you talked to your dad about any of this. There may be a lot more to the story than you know. Yes it was shitty your dad cheated but he was still a good dad to you right. It's not your fault the adults in your life acted shitty.",

            "You are very thoughtful and mature",
            "I am in your sisters position, and it\u2019s great you want to reach out and see your dad\u2019s flaws in the situation. I\u2019m 19 my sister 14. My dad\u2019s new daughter is 1. He left us 7 years ago. It\u2019s hard because part of me wants to hate my younger sister and I have to stop and remind myself that she is innocent in all this and it isn\u2019t her fault. I hope your sister can see that to and you guys can build a relationship.",
            "I have 6 siblings and only the two youngest have the same parents. \n\nMy mom even gave away her first child and we didn't even know about her until she was 18 and I 12. My older sister still resents my mom for taking away a part of her life that she'd never know. I personally am jealous my sister didn't have to deal with abuse or our stupid cult of a religion. \n\nThe two youngest are from the teen that used to babysit us, who my dad cheated on my mom for and even beat over. They had a house, a dog, newest TV's and consoles they went on vacations and traveled.\n\nWe can't change our parents or our pasts, and everyone will always be looking at how greener it must have been elsewhere. I would recommend starting a conversation with \"Hey, I don't know what went on with our parents, but I don't care about them, you're my sister and I'd really would love to have a relationship with you\".\n\nAlso just Google your brothers gamertag, it'll probably pop up stuff about him. People usually share usernames across social media and consoles.",
            "Sadly I was essentially in your sisters situation. My dad left me at 4 years old and had another family.\n\nI have no idea why anyone would think it\u2019s acceptable to abandon their kids but I can tell you from experience that it can very easily set you back without you even realizing.\n\nThe best way to describe it would be that I grew up with 50% of what others did and only realized this when I was grown up.",
            "I didn\u2019t know about my older half sister until I was 12 and she was 19. Her mom told my dad that she was going to raise her and she didn\u2019t want his help, and then he signed his rights away. It took me a little while but now I definitely see how he wronged her.",
            "Your dad cheated which was bad, but you don't know that he gave up being a father to his other kids. He could have tried for a long time to see them as much as possible just to have been blocked by his ex-wife. You should talk to him about this, he's the only one who knows the full story.",
            "Maybe he wanted to be there but their mother didn't let him. You should give him the benefit of doubt until you can seat down and ask him what happened",
            "You shouldn't feel guilty at all, you have no responsibility whatsoever for your parents' decisions. Your resentment towards your father is 100% justified.  Looks like all adults suck here.  \nHappy or sad marriage, your parents were shitty for cheating. If your dad's marriage was so bad he should've ended it before messing with someone else. Your mom shouldn't have been \"dating\" a married man. Your father should have never stopped being a father to his kids from his first marriage. Your dad's first wife shouldn't have poisoned her kids relationship with their half-siblings, regardless of what happened.  \nIf you want to talk it out with your parents it's your right.  \nBest of luck in reuniting with your half siblings!",
            "Sorry to hear that, but also... great to find new family!\nI\u2019ve recently found that I have 2 siblings, oldest being 20. Of course you\u2019ll never have that strong bond but it\u2019s never too late to try and become good friends!",
            "It's your father's fault not your fault \nGo find a way to met your sis and talk to she",
            "You are lucky and hopefully a relationship will develop between you two.   I have a similar story but I found out WAY too late.  My sister died young (26 yrs) so I never had the privilege of communicating with her.   I do have a photo - she was a lovely woman.",
            "My dad was the Johnny Appleseed of kids in Ohio. I later found out I had 3 sisters and my sister I grew up with wasn't his. I have only one full sibling, my brother. But our father pretty much bailed on all but my brother and none of us had contact until about 6 years ago I made contact with them all. It's been amazing, I hope you guys connect well. We all kinda have bad feelings for our father but we don't let us be a storm cloud over us, we all do better and work together to make up lost time. Best of luck!",
            "Make sure to tell them this. I think you have a great perspective about this. My dad left when I was a teenager and raised someone else's kids. I feel resentful for this, of course. I imagine she does too. It isn't your fault though, remmeber that.  I wish you luck in rekindling a relationship with your siblings!",
            "I read this and made me ask my mom about my dad too. \nIt started out that my last name was a borrowed one then i asked about my Dad\"s name and last name. P.s never seen my dad or know his name. Found out my mom was also the other woman while my dad had kids. My mom said my half siblings are like 30yrs + and dad is like 60. \nIm not sure if she knew if he was married tho cuz my sht of a dad hit on her while she was working at a grocery store \ud83d\ude24.  Mom cut him off after my dad met me when i was 3 apparently. I'm 19 now so I can take take all this sht and not be bothered much. Im just really curious who's my dad.",
            "Remember, there are two sides to every story and you don't even have a full one side yet. Custody situations can get tricky, especially when one party is holding a grudge. You don't know that your father chose to not see his other kids, give him the chance to explain before you rush to judgement on him. It's possible their mother holds a good deal of blame for her kids growing up without their father.",
            "I have a question for OP. You have opened up a conversation between my husband and I about our situation. Our stories are not quite along the same lines other than his wife cheated on him. My question is how do you feel about your mother in all this? Has your view of her changed since finding out the truth? I know one day his kids will want to know, or may already know but are too young to comprehend the situation and we are curious about how that might change their relationship with their mother.",
            "I think it's great you're taking a step towards getting to know your half-sister again.  You both have very strong feelings about your mutual father, but that doesn't have to lord over your future relationship with her -- don't let that cloud everything between the two of you.  What he did wasn't your fault and it wasn't your sister's fault.  How the two of you decide to move forward with your sisterhood at this point is up to the two of you, not up to him, or your mother, or her mother.  Good luck and I think this is a wonderful development for the both of you, and hopefully very healing as well.",
            "Oh lovely person. Those adults (your parents  and your siblings mum) made decisions for themselves, and here you are today. Please do not feel guilty. \nAlso, your dad cant go back and change the past so please, love him, treat him as he should be treated by his current behavior. \nI like how considerate you are being in your approach to your sister. Be ready for any kind of reaction from her though, she likely wont feel exactly the way you do. \nLove.",
            "I do not understand what kind of man could just abandon their kid. I have a stepdaughter and if my husband wasn't in her life I wouldn't be in his. Good for you to be mature enough to consider your half siblings feelings.",
            "Do either of your parents have a workplace EAP (Employee Assistance Program)?  If so, they have great counselors that you can access for free.  Normally you can get 15-20 hours of free counselling to talk to someone.  It may help just to speak with someone who is not involved in the situation.",
            "Do you know if it was your dad's choice not to see his other daughter? Maybe it was his ex's",
            "Honey is not your fault I\u2019m sad to say is your parents. Slowly get to know your siblings go to therapy to help you with this issue. Talk to your father and talk to him about this situation. Did the wife confront you mother and father when she found out the truth. Plus don\u2019t believe what they told you about the wife she might have been a nice person but was very upset when she found out the truth.",
            "You should talk to your dad. That anger and resentment is valid but he was a good dad to you (I think?) which means that maybe he changed/was genuinely unhappy with his first wife.\n\nDon\u2019t carry this pain and resentment, talk it out with him or with a therapist.\n\nAnd take your time with your sister, you can always just say you want to get to know her and your brother but will take it slow. Don\u2019t put any expectations on it because there\u2019s a lot of hurt feeling all around which will manifest in odd ways. Good luck!",
            "You're only 17...you have that idealistic view of the world...that will change with years and experience. Dont judge...be open and understanding.",
            "I don\u2019t think you should feel bad, or be angry at your father...  sounds like he was in a loveless marriage and was unhappy.  It sucks he cheated, but he has been with your mother for a long time.  He deserves happiness too. \n\nAs far as with his daughter, it can be very difficult for a someone to have a relationship with their child while the other parent is poisoning the kids against them.  \n\nThese are all adult problems, and you should just try to have a good relationship with you half siblings, and not worry about your fathers relationship with them.  \n\nGood luck",
            "I dye my hair blue, purple or green however I watch wayyyyy too much animeand nothing to do with \"daddy issues\" that comment was irresponsible, ridiculous and possible sarcasm yet inconsiderate nonetheless.",
            "Both of your parents are responsible for their crappy behavior and morals. However, I wouldn\u2019t be too harsh on him being a father. There may be details that you\u2019re not aware of. It seems he was quite involved with your half sister/brother, as you say you spent a lot of time together until you were 6. Having them over as often as he had them doesn\u2019t sound like he was abandoning them to me. Perhaps something came to light, or there was some conflict that caused your father\u2019s ex to keep their children away from him. \n\nI understand your resentment towards your father, but talk to him to understand what happened and why he was no longer part of their lives after regular visits.",
            "I think you may need to talk to your dad, and let him tell his side. There's a possibility he didn't abandon your half siblings. My dad doesn't have a great relationship with my older half brother, but he's an excellent father. His first wife ran off before my brother was a year old, and hid until my brother had to register for school. My brother was led to believe his step dad was his real father all those years, and once he was reintroduced to our dad when he was 5 his mom started shit talking dad every chance she got. My brother was pretty distant from us until his teens, when he started to see for himself my dad wasn't a monster. But it severely damaged his relationship with my dad, step mom and all of the siblings. It's up to your sister to decide what kind of relationship she wants, but it seems like your dad was a good father to you. You can still love and care about him, but still be disappointed by choices he made/makes.",
            "He ain\u2019t shit. I be smashing on my dad for not fucking with my sisters because it\u2019s like you not the loving man I think you were you\u2019re willing to leave your seed, my siblings like that? So if you got mad at mom you\u2019d do me the same? Like nah he ain\u2019t cool and coming from you will def make an impact.",
            "Yes we should!\n\n\nExcept - I don't know how to do it lol",
            "I think I\u2019m gonna call this story some creative writing. Your dad abandoned your half siblings so he doesn\u2019t get to be your dad? That sounds pretty ungrateful for what you had and if I was your half sibling I\u2019d resent you even more for not appreciating that you at least got to have a dad in your life. Also you apparently know some of the story but I\u2019ll just say this you can\u2019t really judge any of it properly. You don\u2019t know the full details of anything nor have you been in any of those situations. Never been a parent, a spouse, or even an adult. Nor did you grow up without your dad who apparently treated you very well. I\u2019d advise focusing on trying to make a bond with your half siblings if they seem open to it and if that\u2019s what you want. However, I\u2019d calm down with your judgemental criticism and righteousness on anyone else in the situation. You\u2019ll only lose family members acting like that.",
