After making the post and seeing the answers i realized just how blind i had been. I just used all the anger that got out to finally be brave enough to leave.\n\nWhen he got home from work i sat him down and told him i was breaking up with him. I gave him back the ring. I had already started packing my things since i knew he would make everything difficult as to who would keep the apartment. He just stared at me when i was speaking and when i was finished he got *angry* because in his words i was trying to control him by threatening to leave. I made sure he knew it was not a threat and that i was leaving regardless of what he would do or say. I tried to cut the conversation there but he just kept arguing with me. He accused me of letting my jealousy destroy our relationship. Told me i was behaving like a child. I told him he should be glad he won't have to deal with the child again. \n\nHe just kept following me around when i was getting my things to leave for the night. He went from accusing me to begging me to stay. He even said he would cut Jessica, apologized but i don't trust him anymore. I won't fall for his damage control again.\n\nAnd so i'm living with my friend now. I'll contact him for the apartment later and i guess that's all.\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Broke up with fiance. I feel angry and numb and sorry for myself for dealing with this all those years. I'll leave him in 2015 and move on.",

            "Dude was a piece of shit for lying the entire time. \"Trying to control him\" clearly means \"I don't like it that you're standing up for yourself and not being a pushover like I'm used to\"....ass. Good for you OP.",

            "Go you!  I know how hard it must have been, and that you're hurting in spite of all the nonsense.  But you spared yourself a very unhappy marriage, and you did it by keeping yourself cool and collected and not letting his manipulative tactics faze you for a minute.  Here's to a *way* better 2016 - and all the other years to come - without him and Jessica.",
            "Nailed it.",
            "Good for you OP. Glad to see that you needed to do something and did it. Great job.",
            "Bullet dodged. A good partner is someone that is proactive when their SO has a valid concern, not someone that is reactive and only decides to fix things after they've seen that you're serious. It's great to see that you didn't get suckered in by his last ditch effort to 'fix' things.",
            "Congratulations on being so strong and confident - it's something to be proud of.\n\nIt will still be difficult to manage your feelings about the breakup even though you're clearly in the driver's seat.  I would expect to hear from him and/or Jessica, and I'm sure you'll be ready to deal with it with the same measured, sensible reasoning you've demonstrated here.  Think about blocking him from your phone, facebook, what'sapp, etc. \n\nThe type of dishonesty that allows someone to cheat and manipulate those who they think they love also allows them to be extremely dishonest with themselves.  Rest assured that he'll be telling himself in the days and weeks to come that you were jealous, insecure, possessive, and all the rest.  And if you start worrying about what he's thinking: fuck that.  You have given him enough of your time and energy and he doesn't deserve any more after how he has treated you.  No rational person will hear your story and believe you made the wrong move or that you treated him unfairly. \n\nVery cool that you did this at the end of the year so that you can see 2016 as a Renaissance for you.  Nice work.  ",
            "This is the best, he needs to learn to be honest and to prioritize his SO and set clear boundaries with Jessica.",
            "Hey OP, it's your favourite redditor again. \n\nWay to go on the decision. I think it is pretty clear that this was the correct decision given the serious breech of trust and the lack of a suitable answer / follow through with you on your ex's part. \n\nObviously, I am also going to provide a bit of my opinion for you whether you choose to take my advice or not. \n\nMy advice for you is simple; do things that make you happy. Conversely, avoid things that make you unhappy. I know this seems straight forward, and maybe even condescending given the simplicity but many people do not understand that in relationships (and outside too) you SHOULD NEVER be afraid to say NO and you should never be afraid to walk away. \n\nNow, knowing when to walk away is difficult as relationships seep into all parts of your life. The important thing going forward is KNOWING what you want and KNOWING what you do not want. \n\nWrite out a list of goals or desires or things you want to accomplish. Remember these goals. Re-read them. Study them. Dream them. Let them be part of WHO YOU ARE. \n\nThen, when a situation arises that takes you away from these goals, you will know to say NO and you will have the confidence to say NO as you have internalized your dreams and desires and understand that they do not align. \n\nIf your goal is to have a trusting, loving, fulfilling romantic relationship, and you have internalized this, moving on will be easier and I believe understanding how to maneuver in the dating world will become more clear. \n\nUnderstand your goals. Write them out. Internalize them. Understand the obstacles to those goals. Prepare yourself for them. \n\nLife isn't linear. Things don't go \"A, B, C, D...\" Life is unfair. Life punishes the weak and rewards those who put the effort into having a great life. \n\nIt is not easy. People will tell you that you are wrong ALL THE TIME. That's because the majority of people are not destined to be great. The majority of people are destined to be average. And they will be scared or skeptical of your focus on your goal as most people cannot internalize goals and dreams as the outside world is distracting. \n\nYou got this OP. ",
            "Yes!  You're a fucking rock star.",
            "Good for you! Apologies and promises mean nothing from someone who has lied to you and put you second for so long. You've proven to yourself that you deserve better.",
            ">He went from accusing me to begging me to stay. He even said he would cut Jessica, apologized but i don't trust him anymore. **I won't fall for his damage control again.**\n\nNice!",

            "I'm really glad to see this. Even if he promised to chamge, there is still all the damage he did to you for years that can't be taken back. Sometimes it's too late and he shouldn't have done it anyway and he knew it.",
            "Ugh. Right choice, I think. But sad and exhausting, none the less. I hope you have a nice, relaxing weekend. \n\nAnd, honestly, you handled this like a boss. No conversation, really, you knew what was good for you. No debate. No bargaining. Just done based on past behavior, as opposed to listening to his lip service about the future. ",
            "You rock! You are so awesome for staying calm in the face of his anger and staying strong when he resorted to manipulation tactics and insulting you. \n\nLove yourself and pamper yourself. Have a great holiday season! ",
            "Ugh, good for you OP. That must have been hard as hell, but you had the high ground, and everything you laid out here was the RIGHT thing to do.\n\nThe best case scenario with your ex is that he's devastated by this, and learns not to hide SERIOUS SHIT from people he's close to again. In which case, you've done the world a favor, starting with yourself. Good luck!",
            "Honey, I'm so sorry. We're here for you, though. And you really did the right thing. It was a good, bold move on your part, and that's the best thing in the world. Congrats! ",
            "And now you'll never have to deal with the child again.",
            "Good for you! I'm sure you will find someone who YOU will be their soulmate. Best of luck :)",
            "> Told me i was behaving like a child. I told him he should be glad he won't have to deal with the child again.\n\nAwesome comeback. You go girl.",
            "Way to go!\n\nWanted to say, you probably don't even need to talk to him about the apartment.  Just call the leasing office and ask them to take you off the lease.  You might have to sign a form or something.",
            "Bravo, OP! You made the right choice. Feel proud of yourself, leaving can be hard to do! :)",
            "I am so proud of you! This was a really brave move and you can start 2016 fresh. ",
            "He knew he was wrong and tried turning it around on you to deflect from the fact he screwed up and in case you were bluffing. As soon as he realized you weren't, he started apologizing and crap. Good for you to be self confident enough to still walk away. Good luck",
            "> I told him he should be glad not to have to deal with the child again\n\nBoom! You handled him and this situation so well!",
            "I'm sorry he had you living his lie, but good for you for being confident in yourself. Let him go to his equally deceitful \"soulmate\" and you find someone who thinks you hung the moon.\n",
            "I'm really REALLY proud of you. I know it must have been hard, but you made a decision that absolutely serves your own best interest. You deserve someone who actually wants you for you, not for an \"in-between\" break from sex with his fuck buddy.\n\nKudos OP. Stay strong.",

            "This was the only way.  Sounds like he's in love with her and she loves that he is, but he isn't good enough for her or something.  She loves the attention and gifts and uses him as a crutch when she needs validation or is single again and can't bear to be alone.  He was always settling with you since she won't have him.",

            "YES!  I know it feels absolutely, disgustingly, gut-wrenchingly horrible right now, but you did the right thing and you will feel better.  I left my fiance 2 months before our wedding (he got abusive) and it was terrible terrible.  But 2.5 years down the road I have never once regretted my decision or looked back.  Stand tall, you have principals, morals and a spine!  You will come out on top!",
            "Going through something like this sucks at the time, but it is actually a great thing, because in the long run, you will end up in a *much* better relationship with a *much* better partner. \n\n You have learned a lot about relationships, what you should have in a partner, and even about yourself. The future's looking bright!  Congratulations!",
            "I'm sorry. This was probably really hard to deal with. I think it's hard enough when your SO shares a connection like that with someone else without there having been a sexual history.",
            "Nice job! I don't see why those two just date since they are clearly in love. People are fricken weird. ",
            "You're very brave, OP. Don't ever doubt that you made the wrong decision. Someone out there is reading this post and finding the strength to do the same for themselves. \n\nI wish you the best, good luck!",
            "YOU GO GIRL!  I seriously want to high five you through this computer screen.  I don't know you, but I'm SO proud you stood up for yourself.\n\nYou deserve the best.  You deserve to be first.  NO ONE PUTS BABY IN A CORNER!",
            "It's so unfortunate when I see people (mostly guys) fuck up relationships like this. Typically the woman gives so many chances to rectify and fix whatever issue but they just downplay it, ignore it until the woman runs out of chances and gets to a \"point of no return\" zone. Then they are like \"wtf have I done\".\n\nThat was totally me last year. In hindsight, I wasnt really into my girlfriend at the time and it was just the fact that she broke up with me suddenly that my instant reaction was damage control. After getting over the initial hell, I realised it was good for both of us.\n\nYou (and my ex) deserve someone who will listen and treat shit like this seriously.\n\n",

            "Good for you girl. I'm proud of you! And you're so young, you'll find someone way, wayyyyyy better. You dodged a bullet, really. I know you must be missing him and there is a part of you that still loves him, and you'll have times in the future when you question / others make you start questioning if you've made the right choice today, but trust me, it was the right choice.

There is another thing bothers me a lot, he wanted to fly to a new city to hang out with his ex, he went there before, and he knew I wasn't happy about his relation with her, and I think she still likes him, don't u think it's too much to do that? They were sleeping in the same bed when he met her last time (they were both single ), I just think normal girl wouldn't do that, am I wrong?\n\nAlso I feel bad about that because I think he doesn't care how I feel, he knew that I don't like her, but he still wanted to go there. \nWhat do you think ?\n\n",

While most the time this may be adequate advice to give this never considers the nuances between two unique individuals and the love they feel between each other. I definitely do not condone staying in an unhappy relationship, but it sounds as though in this particular case this was only one issue. \n\nOP don't be a fool. You agreed to marry this guy, don't walk away if this is your only problem. Don't be a push over, assert yourself but give him the oppurtunity to fix the qualms you have.\n\nTruly great couples overcome problems. I honestly think the only situation you will be in where you do not have any issues in your relationship is when you either do not care about the other person a great deal or you are not invested enough to be yourself.

I also decided to do it right around 6am when it was starting so I could sort of catch it in the act.\n\nI went down to my landlord's floor and simply said, \"Hey guys, just FYI, I can hear that in my apartment as though it's happening right outside my door. I guess the walls are thin and the door is right here by the stairs. You may want to consider some kind of soundproofing for the benefit of future tenants.\" (My lease runs out in a month and I'm not renewing, so didn't bother to ask for it for myself.)\n\nI was surprised when my landlords said they had no idea I could hear it. Apparently the other building residents (both of whom have lived in my unit) didn't hear it or did but didn't say anything about it. My landlords were also very apologetic and said they were really sorry.\n\nThe next thing that happened was awesome. The 9 year old was in the room, sitting facing away and now totally silent. The mother said, \"See? Your behavior has consequences and you've disturbed our neighbors. I think you need to turn around and apologize to porkburp for waking her up.\" She did not turn around (I wasn't really expecting it - she's shy around the tenants) and her body language really seemed to communicate that she was embarrassed/ashamed.\n\nWhen I came home from work, I had a handwritten letter from the girl where she apologized for disturbing everyone and will try harder next time not to behave like that. (I believe every tenant got one of these.) I kind of wish her parents had made her apologize to me on the spot, but I'm okay with the letter.\n\nThis happened a couple weeks ago and so far there's been no further 6am tantrums - at least that I can hear, anyway. So I think confronting the family was a success.\n\nThanks to Reddit for your advice in the original thread. I also really enjoyed some of the shitposts people feel compelled to leave - they make me laugh.\n   \n**TL;DR: Confronted my landlord's family mid-tantrum and kindly asked for soundproofing. They made the child apologize and we haven't had any problems since. Thanks Reddit!**\n\n**Edit** Got a few more things to say in response to these great comments:\n\n* Thanks for the Reddit Gold, stranger!\n* Some people have pointed out that a 9 year old apologizing through a letter as opposed to on the spot isn't so bad considering she's 9; in fact it might be an even bigger punishment because she would have to sit and really think about each letter. That's something I didn't consider and when it's framed that way, I agree that that's sufficient.\n* Some people also think my OP was about asking *whether or not* to discuss the issue with my landlord, but it was actually about *how to bring it up in the most non-offensive way possible*. As some people here have mentioned, some parents can be really sensitive to anything that seems like criticism. I wanted to minimize the possibility of them turning around and trying to make this about me vs. them, since that's not what it was at all.",

Her mom (single F) knows, and says it's hopeless, she rather just lets the children get their way than listen to the tantrums. At least the child has quit kicking the walls.\n\nThey really should have been gone a long time ago, but they're family and they would be homeless without us taking them in.

Why do parents think their children can treat their own parents this way? They thought her tantrums were only something they had to endure. When it was brought to their attention that the entire building is also listening to this, then enough was enough. Which is great! But her parents deserve more consideration than anyone. Why did they think they had to put up with that?\n\nWe went out for lunch on Mother's Day last week and a family was seated next to our table shortly after we arrived. They had a toddler (2 or 3 years old) who immediately started whining and was quickly working herself up to a more dramatic state. Her mother said \n\n\"YOU WILL NOT ACT LIKE THIS RIGHT NOW. (points to our table). YOU WILL NOT RUIN THEIR LUNCH.\"\n\nI **very much** wanted to turn around and say \"Thank you for your consideration. But she shouldn't be allowed to ruin your lunch either, right? You are the ones who take care of her day in and out. Who am I to her??\"\n\nIt was just such a backwards way to deal with a child? It's like saying \"I am going to put a roof over your head and feed you everyday and make sure you have everything you need. But you need to treat total strangers with more respect than you treat me.\"\n\n??? Very confusing....\n\n",

            "Too bad they hadn't given her consequences before.  While this worked, it's sad they couldn't parent her before shaming became an option.  A kid screaming this way has been allowed to have the power in the house.  She's screaming because it works which means the parents hadn't given her effective consequences before.  Regardless, good job on the confrontation and I hope it remains peaceful."

Fortunately, it's the former! When I brought it up again, I decided to approach the subject differently- rather than focusing on what I wanted, I focused on what he wanted from the future, and how that might fit with my vision of my own life. \n\nThe first thing I learned from this new approach is that my dear, introverted partner loathes the idea of turning our relationship into a giant showy party, and being vulnerable/romantic in front of our messy, chaotic families. Love should be private, and he hates weddings.  We talked this over and I made it clear that 1) I do not care what our wedding looks like  2) I am happy to wait until he is comfortable with the idea and 3) While I don't care about weddings, marriage is an important part of a lifetime partnership for me. He told me he would think about that, and that it made him feel better to know that I didn't mind forgoing the stuff he sees as \"superficial.\" \n\nLast night, we were discussing our long-term career goals, and he told me that he now does see marriage as part of those plans, because he wants to plan our lives in tandem, and agrees that the benefits and the commitment of marriage are a part of the vision he has of our partnership. He realized that my willingness to forgo the kind of wedding I originally wanted to preserve his comfort made him want to compromise too and he's ready to start incorporating traditional romantic gestures into our lives- including \"the whole song and dance\" of proposals (this is big for him because he is NOT a romantic). We talked it over and agreed that marriage within a year of my finishing law school was the right timeline. This gives him plenty of time to work on his issues with weddings and think about what ours should look like. Knowing that we have the same vision for our lives and a solid timeline in mind completely assuages my worries. \n\nAnd lord the way I blushed when he said he planned to have a ring on my finger before I graduate... I must have glowed.",

I noticed I'd got almost 50% of the test creation and had 2 plannings missing from my schedule next year for every 1 for the other (6) women in my department. (There are 8 of us; my department head assigned herself nothing as she is \"managing\" and needs every prep. But that's another quibble.) I am not the newest and in fact have seniority some of these women, but I'm also not the most experienced (so it's not like \"these are struggling new teachers who need help\"). So, I asked why it was divided this way. I was told, \"Well, Ms. Millie is pregnant and the rest of us have families. If you have to stay late, it's no big deal.\" \n\nI can go to my Principal and deal with it that way; what they've done actually breaks the union contract. But I really was offended by this. I tried to explain my offense, and they literally stared at me gobsmacked. I thought I was being punked. \n\nI thought about posting this on r/childfree, but this isn't just a rant. I actually want to know how to discuss this with them; these are all women who I have previously gotten along with and liked. When the last one (Ms. Millie) got pregnant this year, there have been some conflicts (she is in my grade level, and they made me take on some of her work basically because she had some complications - this I did but I think PLANNING for me to do more is very different than an emergent health issue) as well as some uncomfortable situations for me (having to participate and buy stuff for her baby shower, when I'm not really into those things - but I did so to not cause waves). \n\nAny ideas on how to talk to them to make them see my side? Are they serious with this or just lazy? I can't even imagine this mind set. (I mean, I didn't have kids because I wanted more free time! Not to work more!) \n\nEdit: If it matters, I am married, with pets (3 dogs) but childfree by choice. Also, I want to point out that \"childfree\" doesn't mean I dislike children. It means I don't want to have any (some people have PMed me asking why I teach if I hate kids). \n\n**Edit #2 A lot of people have advised go to the union, go to the Principal, and I absolutely will if necessary. I want to be clear I'm not worried at all that I'll be \"forced\" to work this schedule, but these are my colleagues, many have been working with me 5+ years, and we have lots of meetings and times together, where it's helpful to get along, so I DO try to get along (like the baby shower thing) and be a good \"work friend\" and colleague. I just want a better way to communicate myself than I had today. I was entirely shocked and VERY indignant and just found myself unable to express myself well and I was hoping for ways to approach that someone with their attitude might understand because I can't empathize with it at all, myself (and viewing the other side is how I always try to look at problem-solving).**\n\nTL;DR - My previously reasonable co-workers seem to have gone off the deep end, wanting me to do the majority of the work for the whole department because I am childless and thus have more free time. I have heard of this in theory but never thought seemingly reasonable people would not only do this but COME OUT AND ADMIT IT!",

You go to your department head and tell her that you are being singled out for more work because of your child status, and anything in your personal life is your business and your business alone. If she has any problem with that, you'd be happy to have a joint meeting with the principal. \n\nAsk her if someone with 3 kids should take on less work than someone with one. If someone who's a single mother should have less work than a mother who is married. If someone who has a special needs child should have less work than someone with a healthy child. After all, their available free time is different, right? Unless they plan to compensate you for extra time or job responsibilities, working more because you have more free time is not a valid plan of attack. Feel free to let them know you're more than happy to get the union legal team involved, too. ",

It doesn't matter if you're married with pets, you have children at boarding school, or what. You're not compensated to do additional work, having kids doesn't give them the right to do less work.",
            "Yeah, absolutely not. I am also child-free and co-workers of mine always mention the opportunity for overtime. My department director also brought this up a few times to me. Every time I explained I was not interested in over time, outside of an emergency coming up that I would need to handle once every blue moon. They have pointed to my child-free life as a reason I should welcome the over time. I have told them repeatedly that I am child-free in part because I value my free time and don't want to NEED over time in order to make ends meet.

You can ask for the situation to be handled confidentially in that you don't want your colleagues to know that you are going to the administrator. As a principal I would handle this as if I were reviewing the departmental responsibilities for each person in the department. I would then question the department head as to why there is an imbalance of responsibility between you and your colleagues. \n\nYou can also make a stand and state to your colleagues that you do not accept the additional work. Having children is a personal decision and does not entitle one to less responsibility at work. Even if your administrator was unreasonable enough to back the decision of your colleagues, it obviously violates your union contract if I am understanding you correctly. In addition, you can file a grievance against your administrator as a result.\n\nAt the end of it all, your colleagues error in judgement probably has more to do with end of the year stress. Teachers are receiving more and more responsibilities, but that doesn't give your colleagues the right to make you more accountable because of your life choices (or their own).\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't stand for it and I'd stand up to my colleagues and inform them that they need to distribute the work and prep evenly.\n\nGood luck. :)",

She is also likely aware that it is against the union contract, and that your principal is very passionate about fairness.  Though, you've stated here that you did not do a very good job communicating your objection.

Do not mention the principal or union, yet.  Let her respond.\n\nIs she argumentative?  If so, reword and restate your position.  Pause again.  If she is still argumentative, then you can mention the principals feelings towards fairness, or the union contract.

Often times we fail to identify the right thing, so a friendly nudge is required.\n\n\nI hope this advise is not as scattered as my brains.

I would be very direct and let them know that medical emergencies are much different than planning for you to do so much more.  Let them know in a firm and friendly tone that not only is this against union rules, but is also really insensitive.  What someone chooses to dedicate their life to outside of work, whether it be being a parent or even collecting stamps, should not give anyone special privileges or (in your case) an extra work load.  This is discrimination based on family status.  If they don't comply, talk to the principal, school board, and your union rep to be sure that everyone is made aware or the steps you've taken and so that nothing can be misconstrued.

I have a number of coworkers with families who often need additional flexibility in their work schedules which normally isn't a problem I'm generally able to be accommodating and it isn't a stretch for me to arrange things to cover for them during the normal 9-5 business hours and allow them to make up the work outside normal hours.  It becomes an issue when it goes from simply being agreeable to cover for someone during an emergency or family event to actually being expected to work more because you don't have kids. The approach I ended up taking was to explain my feelings on the matter like this.\n\n \" We are all team mates, all equals, all peers we are all expected to contribute equally to get things done and the idea is that we will all devote roughly 33%(*8 hours roughly*) of our day to making sure we are meeting the needs of the business (*kids or school in your case I guess*). You're asking me to devote 41% (*roughly 10 hours*)  of my day so that all of you can contribute 29%(*roughly 7 hours*) \n\nI understand life isn't always easy to plan for and I'm generally willing to help out in cases of emergency.  I value all of you as peers. I believe that we are a good team and that any of you would do the same if I were facing a crisis, however I know you are all intelligent adults. I don't believe that any of you can possibly think that its fair or just to expect one person to work harder so that everyone else can have more time away from work. \"\n\nI try to avoid using phrases like \"free time\" or \"time off\" since these tend to conjure images of just relaxing doing nothing. I try to stick to describing it as time on the job and off the job since that's the issue at hand. Time with family can be an emotional subject for people so for me at least framing it in terms of numbers was the best way to try and show exactly how unfair this was",

Do not make a logical argument or appeal to general ideals, people do not make decisions based on logic, they make decisions based on emotion. What this means is, if you want to change their minds about this, appeal to them on a personal and emotional level. Tell them a personal story about a time you worked late and you felt bad. Ask them about their experience with too much work. Basically, make them feel why this sucks for you. That's the way you will make them understand.\n\nThat being said, they may not. If they don't, then definitely follow the advice of the top commenters. Good luck",

If you body and brain is fried after working x hours and working a lion share beyond that x hours affects the quality of your work, she will pay attention. If you use an angle that the other person cares about and offer reasonable solution, the conversation may be more fruitful. It might also be helpful to use past metrics as your calculation (ie. Amount of work to in to yield certain results) to back up your discussion. Bosses love metrics. Be respectful and pragmatic. ",

This is likely to be considered part of good team work and that if you had a kid some day then you'd receive the same consideration. Their point of view is that it's not their fault that you don't plan to have kids.  It doesn't at all mean they are right but I'm explaining why they don't understand your concerns.\n\n- When you go complain to your Union, no matter how carefully the union handles it, you will be perceived by the staff as a non-team player.

You'll be examined under a microscope so heaven help you if you ever make a mistake at work.  \n\nYou sound a little clueless about the realities of the work environment.
