She saw the no-shows before I could let her know about it.  \n\nI called her and suggested some other activities we could do, things like amusement parks or concerts or taking a cooking class.  I thought she'd like all those ideas.\n\n\"No thank you.\"\n\nWe were kinda quiet over the phone, until she asked me in a really small voice if I could come over.\n\nWe met outside her dorm at like 3 in the morning.  She was crying, as I expected.  But it was just watery eyes, not full on sobs how she usually cries.\n\n\"It's okay,\" she said.  \"Some people aren't meant to have friends.\"\n\nI told her she was exaggerating, that she just needs to look in different places, etc.  She shook her head.  \"No, I'm done.\"\n\nThis morning at breakfast we passed a lot of mutual acquaintances.  Usually my girlfriend smiles and says hello.  Today she just kept her eyes on the pavement, not looking at anyone.  She barely ate.  But other than that she seemed like her normal self with me, talking and laughing.  She just wouldn't look at anyone else.\n\nShe told me how she's going to use this extra time to get better in her classes, to work on her jewelry and maybe open an etsy shop.  To read more books.\n\nI asked her if this is really what she wanted.\n\n\"No, but life doesn't always give you what you want.  I didn't want to be an engineer.  I didn't want to live in a basement alone.  I didn't want to hate college and wish every day that I could drop out.  But you make the best of it.\"\n\nHer voice was breaking as she said this, but she didn't cry.  She left the breakfast table after that and said she wanted to be alone.\n\nWhere the hell do I go from here?  Her actual birthday is tomorrow (we were throwing the party a week later) and she insists she doesn't want to do anything.  Is it bad that part of me sort of agreed with her, that some people aren't meant to make friends?  I don't think I am, but obviously she wants friends and it's making her miserable.\n\n**tl;dr**: Girlfriend canceled party, said she didn't want to do anything for her birthday, and announced that she's given up on finding friends.  She isn't going back to any of her clubs or activities, and is going to focus on her studies and hobbies this coming year.  Her actual 21st birthday is tomorrow.  Where do I go from here?\n\n**EDIT:  I am sitting with her in her dorm room right now.  She's on the bed reading, I'm on the couch minding my own business, just being near her.  She is okay.**",

            "I've read the entirety of your other thread and your comments here, and I have a few thoughts that I hope you won't take personally. You seem to truly care for your girlfriend and I think you're a great boyfriend to her. That being said...\n\nNeither of you seem to understand social interactions, and you seem to be reinforcing each other's misunderstandings. You wrote that she skips from group to group events but \"hasn't even been able to get a girl to go for coffee with her.\" That's *understandable.* You would have to meet up in a group setting a few times in college to be memorable and comfortable enough for a one-on-one invite. I feel like she fails on getting the one-on-one invite and she feels as though she's doing something wrong, and *you* feel as though she's doing something wrong, when in reality she's approaching the situation incorrectly to begin with.\n\nIf she wants to make friends, she should sign up for book clubs, knitting circles, jewelry making groups, and *go to them continuously.* Go to www.meetup.com and find some groups for her in your area. They will usually have a good mix of college kids and older in a college town, giving her exposure to people in all stages of life and -- more importantly -- social spectrums. These are people who *want to make friends.*\n\nFrankly, the fact that you aren't interested in friends is holding her back, *though that's not your fault*. She wants to be social and has entered into a cycle of not having friends -> getting desperate -> alienating people through desperation -> not having friends. You may feel as though she should \"just give up,\" but if she picks up on that, it's only going to make her worse. She is clearly a social person. \n\nI have a feeling that you not wanting friends \"as a personal choice,\" and focusing solely on work and your girlfriend, is deterring many people who know you two as a couple. They probably see you as cold and/or emotionless, even if you don't mean to be that way. It is unusual to be disinterested in friendship, especially after so long. You've had roommates for three or four years in college, get along reasonably well with them, and yet have never been interested in them as friends; *of course* they won't come to your girlfriend's party! I wouldn't want to either. I would feel weirded out by even being asked.\n\nIf you want to help your girlfriend, you may just have to step outside of your own social comfort zone a little and at least try to be a little friendlier. Couples tend to meet people together, and if you're coming off as aloof and not needing human interaction \"by choice,\" you're going to run people off *away from her.* \n\nEdit: By the way, I don't mean to put the onus on you to change. If she was here asking for advice, I would be focusing on her. But she's already gotten some great advice from other people here, and I wanted to comment on some things that were sticking out to me in your replies.",
            "If she normally reacts/acts out more dramatically and all of a sudden she's this kind of calm, accepting sad, I would stick to her like white on rice. At the end of the day no one knows her better than herself and likely you, but this sounds very familiar to experiences i've had, and if it's similar then calm sad=profoundly sad. So sad you can't even work up the energy to really be upset or cry. Be there for her. Do something nice for her, plan activities that she would like, think if she's casually mentioned anything she might like. Anything that will make her feel like she is less alone. It's OK for some people to not have friends outside one's SO and family, but it can be very emotionally stressful at times. ",
            "When she is trying to make new friends, is she trying too hard? Sometimes that can be the problem. ",
            "I feel so sad for your girlfriend. I see a lot of me in her. I just left a long post of ideas in your last thread. I do think they can help.\n\nIf your girlfriend stops looking for friends and starts embracing activities, it may be easier.\n\nI am concerned that she's majoring in something she doesn't love or even like much. Being unhappy about something so central in your life can bleed into everything else, including trying to make friends.",
            "Your girlfriend sounds depressed, is there a counseling service on campus she can visit? I would definitely recommend she talk to someone about how she's feeling.\n\nAs far as her birthday, can the two of you just do something low-key? If you  haven't gotten her anything, maybe get her something related to her hobby? Spend the day just relaxing together/doing her hobby?",
            "She should really talk to a therapist. Many colleges offer free counseling for students- I would encourage her to go, at least to one session. It's sad to hear she is giving up on activities she loved because no one wants to be her friend. Counseling should give her help with coping, and perhaps motivation to re-join groups. I don't agree that some people aren't meant to have friends, but I think it's just that they haven't found the right ones yet. Counseling might also help her determine if there is maybe something off-putting that she's doing and improve her social relations.",
            "Well I'm a lot like her.  Used to be, anyway.  Always tried, decent guy, nothing worked.  This isn't about me so I won't explain, but I tried for decades to make friends.  Finally gave up.  It's not what I want, but it's what I've got.  I have my partner, a few guys I can call to fish with a few times a year.   That's it.  I don't even know if those fishing buddies have kids.  One does, actually, I saw them once.\n\nThis may or may not be helpful at all, but there are people who have experienced this exact thing and gone on to find peace.  I'm *happier* now that I don't try anymore, but I'm not *happy* in as much as I still wish I had better friends.  Overall I'm content with life, things could be a lot worse, but I am a little lonely.  So be it.   \n\nBest of luck to the both of you, you sound like a great boyfriend and she sounds pretty cool too.  ",
            "21 is too young to give up on a social life. I would still take her out tomorrow and give her a memorable day.",
            "My god, that's heart breaking! \n\n> Is it bad that part of me sort of agreed with her, that some people aren't meant to make friends? \n\n\"Meant\" to? No, that's hogwash. There isn't a plan all laid out for life - no fates winding webs that comprise what you are going to do and be.  You (and by extension your GF) have to make your own path in life. *You are her friend* - you value her for more than just sex, right? Well, that being the case, other people would value her too. \n\nIs there no people you can call to hang out tomorrow? Not a party, per say, but like, just a group to go out for drinks? You mentioned in the other post that you had a group of people you *asked to come* but they made excuses. I would call them up and tell them that I pretty much needed them to come out and celebrate my GF's B-day. Not a party though, I think that would feel forced for your GF.  But like just a get together. I mean, shit, they have to eat dinner anyway, right? So why not a dinner/celebration for your GF's b-day?",
            "Wow. My heart is breaking for her. I've been through this myself, and I just moved someplace new and I'm going through it again. I think I can remember having a similar conversation with my boyfriend. \"I'm just not very likeable. I guess I'll just focus on liking myself, since no one else is going to do it.\" Through some trial and error, I've pretty much confirmed that I try too hard and get nervous & awkward when I get the chance to make new friends. \n\nPlease, please, please don't leave her alone. If she's anything like me, she will tell you she wants to just do her own thing tomorrow because further isolating herself seems like the only option to avoid more hurt. Don't let her. Don't let her memory of her 21st birthday be tainted with the pain she's feeling. Take her somewhere she loves and don't forget to tell her how much you care. There's *nothing* wrong with her and she shouldn't be punishing herself. \n\nIn the long term, maybe join some clubs together? Tell her to focus on herself and the friends will come... It's easier said than done, but having fun makes other people want to have fun with you. \n\nLots of birthday wishes to her from Ohio! <3 here's hoping she finds everything she's been looking for this year. ",
            "> Is it bad that part of me sort of agreed with her, that some people aren't meant to make friends? I don't think I am, but obviously she wants friends and it's making her miserable.\n\nI'm probably going to get down voted for this, but do you think that you have anything to do with this? I think you've been a great boyfriend to her so far, but have you made any efforts to really help get her out there? To me, it sounds like you really only have each other... and regardless of not wanting friends, that isn't entirely healthy. If you were to break up, what kind of a support system would either of you have?\n\nMaybe suggest doing activities together that require meeting and interacting with other people. Like volunteering at an animal shelter, volunteering at a local library, etc.\n\nAs others have suggested, she should seek therapy. They may be able to help her build up some skills that will allow her to interact with people in a genuine, warm way that they will respond to, in addition to addressing what seems to be depression.",
            "I am in no way trained in this kind of stuff, but having been in the military, we were constantly shown and told signs of depression.  Things that, unaided, have the chance to lead towards suicide.\n\nShe is depressed.  Lots of people get that way at some point.  You know her better than us, how serious it might or might not be.  If she won't go to a counselor at school, you should go and talk to them yourself and get help in figuring out how to help her.\n\nEven if your help pushes her away from you and you break up... Nothing would be worse than seeing her struggle, not doing everything in your power to help and she does something drastic.\n\nI've watched a guy pick up 2 40lb chains (used to tie down an aircraft), put them over his shoulder, and step overboard on an aircraft carrier.  Nothing is worse than feeling like you could have done more.  She could hate your guts and spew venom at your for the rest of your lives, and that would be better than realizing too late that she needed real help. ",
            "Yeah she's suffering rejection pains right now. Give her some time to cool off and just hang out with her on her bd. Just support her in her decisions (as long as they're rational) and see where it goes. She will probably recover eventually. ",

            ">Where do I go from here?\n\nFirst you need to plan something special for her birthday. Even if it is only a picnic sort of thing for the two of you.\n\nSecond, There is a reason she's not making friends and it is not \"some are meant to be alone\" type of thing. Maybe she seems too eager/desparate to other people? Maybe she' looking for friends in a place that doesn't suit her temperament?\n\nThirdly, she needs hope and she seems to be a long way from it. She needs counseling. If she says she doesn't want to go, tell her to do it for you 'cause you want to see her surrounded with friends. Tell her that it is a way to improve upon herself. And maybe she can do it on her own but it's gonna take a **LOT** more years that way.",
            "I used to be like your girlfriend.  And in my mid-twenties, I found my people!  There are some amazing communities out there full of amazing, dorky, former misfits that break open once they find it.  Many of these are primarily female-driven industries and communities, too.\n\nShe likes making jewelry?  Maybe she would love SCA/reenacting events.  Pennsic in Pennsylvania every August is almost like burning man for us medieval dorks, and we build camps and cities and play music and drink like fish and go to party after party for two weeks wearing stuff we've made.  I'm also a professional tribal style bellydancer.  Not only are you dancing and learning awesome stuff with awesome people, but you get to make and wear amazing costumes and jewelry and headdresses.  Circus arts are really similar.  We had a young girl in my circus school training program who sounds exactly like your girlfriend, and after a month or two training hard with us, she opened up and became a much more confident person in her skin.  We have her back and she has ours.  I've heard great things about cosplaying, too.  Tell her to take that jewelry stuff and see if she can't put it to use in a community that will support her.",
            "OP - I can't offer you any advice, but I am an Etsy shop owner and I make/sell jewelry too. If you'd like (with her permission), PM me her email and I will send her a referral link for opening up a shop which will give her the 40 first listings for free (full disclosure - it'll give me 40 free automatically too). Then if she has questions or stuff, I'll be happy to chat with her over email and help her establish her shop.",

So I give you the wish that you will have a good life. This insignificant gesture will only carry the weight you give it, but believe me when I tell you everything will be brilliant as you grow through all of this. Fight forward to better yourself and claim what is yours from the world. Build the kinds of relationships that last a lifetime, and realize that your self worth is not connected to the opinions of those folks who dont show up. If you have ever been loved than you are capable of love, and all that is left is time and effort. If you loose hope than life can be a crippling self fulfilled prophecy; I have been there before and there is no reason for you to make my same mistakes. \n\n\nI am one of billions of strangers who you have yet to meet, and I am confident that we could be extraordinary friends. I am just around the corner, I am in the coffee shop, I am studying in the library, I am working to build a beautiful life for myself, and all you have to do is find me. It isn't easy, but if you know sadness than you also know empathy. Since you are so troubled it is also obvious that you have the potential to be an extraordinary friend.

She could change any of these things just by making the choice to do something different. She probably hates college because she hates engineering - why doesn't she switch majors then? She is blaming the fates for a situation she has put herself in because she doesn't want to address it head on. Same with this friend stuff - I would be willing to bet she tried once or twice to meet people, found out that it wasn't just walking into a room and people immediately glomming onto her to hear her life story, and she decided to call it \"not meant to make friends\" instead of putting in the effort to meet people, find out what their like, invite people to do things, actually build the friendships beyond acquaintance. This stuff right here is what therapy is for, and the college counselors will be especially tuned to stuff like this because it is their bread and butter. I think it's time for a come to jesus meeting. It doesn't have to be an ultimatum, but you need to put your foot down about her attitude and tell her to get her ass to the counseling center to work out her issues.  ",

Can you surprise her with a nice day out or a lovely thoughtful present? She needs to know most of all that you love her and want to be with her, this will go someway to helping with her no doubt damaged self esteem. Making friends is extremely hard and if you're in a relationship it's even harder because the incentive although there, is not as strong as it would be in a single person. My husband is a quiet man and works hard, he has no real interest in making new friends where we live even though we don't see anyone we know (from before we moved away for his work) for months on end in person. He has asked me whether it's just him or if I think he's become anti-social as he gets older. I've had to make friends for the sake of our daughter, but guess what? It doesn't get any easier in your 30's either and for every friend I've made, I've met someone who hasn't bothered again after an initial meet up or turned out to be less than nice or a bit of a user. The lovely 'real' friends I've made have been hard won. Whenever we socialise together I know my husband needs me to to be the chatty one and that's hard too because you don't always feel like it, but I do it for him until we feel we can go home and climb back into our little bubble of just him, me and our family. Can you try to attend things together, overcome your natural reticence to get involved in college social life and support each other? You might not be fussed bit it sounds like she is, do it for her. In the mean time please tell her you love her and make her feel special on her birthday. All the best to you both. ",
            "A lot of people are giving you good advice for the future, but your question is what to do about her birthday tomorrow, so I'll focus on that.  \n\nFrom the sounds of it, she seems pretty down about life.  It's super easy to feel that way especially in college.  Hell, about half of reddit was there when it was their turn.  \n\nBut life is beautiful.  It's fun and bright and the outside world is full of shining wonders.  And people too.  So, here are a few suggestions, all my personal kind of choices.  Take what you will from them.  \n\n* Take the day off everything.  Seriously, skip school, skip chores, skip life.  Go together out into the world and do things you'd never normally do. Like:\n* Double feature movies.  Hell triple feature if your town has it.  If it's a huge movie theatre, sneak into one. The risk and fear will make the movie better, and if you feel bad about it, buy a ticket later. \n* Cook something crazy, fun, messy, and stupid.  I recommend marshmallows.  Not easy, super messy, a bit dangerous, totally delicious, even in abject failure.  \n* If you have a car, pack up some basic stuff and drive out of the city.  Stars and silence and peace under the beauty of the sky always worked to make me feel better about lonliness, especially if I wasn't alone.\n* If you're looking to be around people, even if they're not your people, there are a million places to go that feel good to be surrounded by people.  Coffeeshops, bars might be the basic, but bowling alleys are one of my favourites.  Plus you get to look at her butt while she bowls.  \n* Be adventurous.  This might seem crazy, but find a boardgame place, or club, or group.  Hell find a DnD group to try out.  You might hate it, it might be terrifying, but I bet you won't get turned away.  \n* Create a story.  A treasure hunt about why you love her.  A obstacle course of insanity, filled with whipped cream, stripping, screaming, and other absurdities.  Life is too short for not having whipped cream body shots on your 21st birthday.  \n\nIn the end, life is the adventure you make of it.  It I could honestly give only one piece of advice, it would be this:  Stand with your hands on your hips like a superhero for two whole minutes.  Breathe deep and yell for as good long time.  Then say to her and yourself, \"Fuck this, Adventure Time!\" And go out in the world and do something you've never done before.  Not something quiet and shy, something bold and possibly just maybe stupid.  \n\nNo matter who is with you, that day will feel like a whole new world.  \n",
            "There's already a lot of posts with great advice and emotional support.\n\nI can add my own experience. I had a horrible time in college, suffering from many of the same things as she mentioned.\n\nThe quote from her in particular reads like a red flag:\n\n\"No, but life doesn't always give you what you want. I didn't want to be an engineer. I didn't want to live in a basement alone. I didn't want to hate college and wish every day that I could drop out. But you make the best of it.\"\n\nI had the same feelings before I self-destructed and cops became involved in my spiral downwards. I had to see a councilor as part of the terms for my release out of the custody of the police.\n\nI want to share something that took me a long time to figure out.\n\nIn this part of her life, she needs to be brave. If she doesn't want to be an engineer, then she needs to face the facts and emotional truths about herself, and change majors. If she wants to get out of the basement, and if she doesn't have money to get her own above ground place, then she should find some roommates and find a place she likes. If she didn't get residence in college, she needs to go out to look for a place to rent. And finally. If she hates college every day, then she needs to DROP OUT and find something she wants to do.\n\nLife gives you your life. Part of growing up is realizing that life is yours to take in your hands and make it work. Making the best of it means getting out of the department of engineering, getting out of the basement, and getting out of school.\n\nAll this requires a tremendous amount of courage. Sometimes one person alone isn't enough to face all this. She needs support from support groups, councilors, and medical professionals - and it's not a weakness to need this kind of help - in fact, it's the best way for her to move forward.\n\nMe. I started in Engineering at a tech focused, highly ranked Canadian university. I couldn't take it any more. Got caught by the police breaking a number of laws, and thankfully no charges were pressed. I dropped out. Biked and hitch-hiked from Vancouver to Seattle on my own, trained to Oregon, and went to summer school at the University of Oregon where I found out that I actually wanted to study English.\n\nWent back home, and after a lot of tears blood and sweat, graduated from the Department of English Literature at UBC in Vancouver.\n\nIt was really hard, and it didn't all happen overnight. It took years. I had my family and my girlfriend who encouraged me and pushed me.\n\nIt's time for her to grow up. It's gonna be hard, but she's lucky to have someone like you in her life to accompany her.",

Attractive people make friends far easier than unattractive ones, all other factors held constant.\n\nYou noted that your gf doesn't know how to do her hair or makeup. \n\nIt might feel weird, but offer to help her experiment. There are loads of YouTube videos and websites dedicated to makeup application and fashion.\n\n A tiny bit of effort on appearance can go a long way for making social interaction easier.\n\nLooking good cannot replace social skills, but it certainly can make it more likely that people (both males and females) will notice her and want to hang out with her. \n\nAppearances can get you in the door of social circles, and social skills keep you there. While it sounds like your girlfriend needs to work on both, the appearance part is far easier to learn and grants you the opportunities to practice the social skill part.\n\nYes people who only care about looks aren't the kind you want to be friends with, but all people notice appearances, even if it's only at a subconscious level. It is part of human nature and you should be aware of it and use it to help your gf.",
            "I'll probably get major down votes but have you considered that there might be a reason that your gf doesn't have friends? Maybe her depression shows through and people don't want to be around a negative person? Or maybe her dramatic reactions to things turn people off? Maybe she's just incredibly clingy and doesn't let people live their lives? \n\nIt seems strange to me that *not one person* said they would show up. \n\nI think your gf needs to spend time working on her self esteem.

She's your girlfriend, but she's also your best friend and you're hers. She has a great friend because she has you and you obviously care a lot about her. If her birthday is tomorrow please bring her something. Get her flowers if she likes them, bring her her favourite take out, a movie she's been wanting to see. Something that she mentioned. My biggest thing with my SO in feeling appreciated and loved is when he shows me that he thought of me and has been listening to what I've been saying. I've mentioned wanting chocolate milk, the next day he brought some home and I nearly cried with the thoughtfulness. Show her you care and that YOU are her friend. ",

            "I had this happening to me literally one week ago. All my \"friends\" said well in advance that of course we'll come and celebrate your birthday. Even though I was hesitant to it due to being let down too many times before I agreed it probably would be fun. The week before I sent them all a group message to sort time and place and all of them cancelled on me. I ended up spending my birthday alone with my SO. Birthdays has always been super important to me and I was so excited to celebrate this year with my new friends from College (I've only lived here a year and didn't have any friends here last year so this was yet another birthday I spent alone). If she says she wants to spend it alone with you don't try to hard to hard to change her mind. My SO tried and we ended up going for coffee up town but it was so many people I just felt like I couldn't breathe and just wanted to go home. He gave me a birthday present I really wanted a huge bouquet of flowers which was really nice. We spent the day ordering in Chinese and watched movies. If she doesn't want to do anything I think you should let her and just try to be there for her. I'm really sorry she had to go through this. It's a horrible feeling to feel so alone when you try so hard to make friends.\n\nEdit: words and grammar",

            "The hardest thing to find in the world is a true friend. She's only 21. She might meet her best friend when she's 40. She might meet her best friend tomorrow. You might be her best friend and she doesn't even think of it like that. Nonetheless, I know exactly how this feels, and I went through a little depression about it. I went to counseling and it really helped me not give a shit about it. I deleted my Facebook, which everyone was sure was contributing to the feelings, and it honestly made me feel so much better. Surrounding herself with that fake shit constantly probably isn't helping. \n\nYour girlfriend can use this extra time, as she says, to do things SHE wants to do...and that will hopefully open up a part of her that will really make her happy. She just has to stick to it. Once I ditched all my fake friends, life blessed me with a lot more things...and I am way happier. \n\nCounseling would be a great idea. It's not like they're going to diagnose her right off the bat...she would need to have psychological testing which she can opt for or out of, but it's nice to go talk to a professional just to get things off the chest to a stranger. Don't keep pushing it though, or you'll turn her off to it even more than it sounds like she already is.

While I do have people that I can have a quick chitchat with, I don't have any close friends. Same with her, I don't think I'll have anyone that will show up to my birthday.  I often wonder what it is about me that turns people off.  Maybe I try to hard.  I usually don't feel like I can relate to anyone.  People always seem to talk about things I have no clue about.  People here my age are married, have a family, working on their career.  My last relationship was nearly a decade ago.  I'm single, no kids, rebuilding my finances, just finish school and about to start a \"real job.\" \n\nI honestly don't know what to tell your g/f.  I've gotten use to it.  I been trying to spend time to enjoy life.  Traveling, volunteering, and working on my craft/skills.  I do have a small dog that I feel keeps me sane.  I do have hope I'll meet someone once I rebuild my life.

            "She's putting too much stock in what other people think.  She's also putting too much stock in human nature.\n\nMy degree is in sociology; I'd rather observe people than interact with them (most of the time).  People are assholes.  They are shallow, self-serving, easily swayed assholes. I don't find this particularly depressing, but I don't even want to be friends with people like that, and that encompasses a lot of freakin people.\n\nI mean, sometimes, you just have to have a fuck em attitude. Zero shits. That may sound mean, but that's not the attitude I'm talking about.  I mean, just a freedom from defining yourself based on other people. What you have written about yourself, I suspect you know what I'm talking about.\n\nWhen you do put time and effort into the things that truly make you happy, you tend to find others who value the same things, they tend to gravitate together.\n\nYou can plan something for her birthday, or you can have a spontaneous day.  One of my favorite birthdays, my husband and I left the house with no real plans.  Couldn't decide on a restaurant when it was time to eat, so had sushi at one place, then appetizers at another.  We went to some beautiful places in our city, did whatever struck our fancy in the moment.\n\nI love my birthday, no matter who is in my life at the time.  You get to do whatever you want (within reason), and you get to realize that you are part of this thing called life.  She needs (IMO) an attitude shift and to find value in herself apart from what others think, but that isn't going to magically happen tomorrow. ",

            "It sounds like she may be very depressed and hurt by this. I wish there was a good way to tell her, and have her believe it, that at 21 I lost most of my friends (over a conflict with an acquaintance/roommate) and that after college I met so many more people. Not everyone makes their \"lifetime\" friends as an undergrad. The people I met after are the ones I'll know for life. I have some people from college on Facebook and they are *still* sort of assholes--but hey, doesn't matter! The people I work with, live around, and choose to spend my time with are so much better than those people. \n\nIf you all are at an engineering school, that could be part of the problem. My own experience at a tech university was that many of the people get there having never really had friends, form cliques, and treat each other worse than the people in high school ever did. It was AWFUL. There was a crazy amount of bullying and even sexual harassment (telling girls they were clearly just there for their \"MRS\" degree or harassing them for having sex, for example). Life after college is simply not like that.",

            "I wish I could be friends with your girlfriend. And if you live in Boston, PM me! But I know them feels so well. Year after year I used to throw parties that nobody showed up for. I always assumed it was some sort of Full House episode scenario that didn't exist in real life, but it does happen and it hurts. Everyone else throws the blame on others. They think, \"oh I don't want to go, but she knows enough people that others will.\" And then everyone does that and nobody shows up. And that feeling of being so disheartened that being sad is an expectation is an extremely awful feeling. \n\nFor me, I felt like once I stopped looking for friends, they fled to me. Maybe that's what your gf thinks. Maybe she doesn't. But its quite clear that she's emotionally exhausted and needs some time to retune her approach. College is hard. It's REALLY hard when you don't have a good roommate, a good relationship (though you seem like a good bf), or a best friend to be there for you for every twist and turn. \n\nJust be there for her and support her in whatever approach she wants to take with the whole thing. I'm not sure what you have planned for her birthday, but buy her flowers. Buy her cupcakes or a funny cake or something. Bitches love cupcakes. Take her for a walk with no specific destination. Or go for a drive. Or go to that movie that she's been dying to see -- I'd suggest Inside Out if you haven't seen it already. Just be there. Ask her questions, make her her first legal drink, and just enjoy the day.

            "Oh man... this update is making me cry. I'm in much the same boat as your girlfriend, I can't seem to make a close friend. I have trouble talking to people one on one and have severe depression, so those two things have gutted me as far as my social life goes.\n\nI do community theater now, which surprisingly I've found I'm actually pretty good at and which has hugely brought me out of my shell, but I still just have acquaintances- no friends.\n\nTo add to this, I'm in a poly relationship, dating a guy who is also dating a girl, and we all do theater together. This girl is not a good person, is fake and manipulative and just downright mean, but she is charismatic and knows exactly what sort of face to put on for others, so she is incredibly well loved by the same group that I wish loved me... or at least liked me a little. So it's kind of a bitter sad pill to swallow. \n\nReading this story truly breaks my heart. I know that I could do so much more to reach out to people but don't due to crippling depression, and I recognize that is my problem- but your girlfriend tries so hard and that just kills me :( I don't have any advice, if I did I wouldn't be in this predicament myself, but... she is not alone. I've said those exact things to myself and to my boyfriend before, and I know what kind of state you need to be in to say those things. I'm just so sorry for her.",

            "Your gf's story really hits home...it's very similar to where I was at 10 years ago (I'm 30 now). My whole life I was painfully shy and awkward and I had no friends even though I desperately wanted them more than anything else. \n\nI got my first boyfriend in my first week of college and, like you, he had no friends but it didn't bother him. The two of us just spent all our time together and we weren't into drinking either. It wasn't until we broke up 3 years later (for other reasons, he was a huge jerk) that I started joining school clubs and meeting people. Like some others have said, the easiest way to make friends at that age is to have something in common with them and to drink with them. With alcohol, you lose your inhibitions and then everyone becomes your friend and you're one of them, just having fun. How serious are your reservations against drinking?\n\nYou say your gf dreams of having girls to go clubbing with and talk to about hair and makeup. The painful truth is that those types of girls would never gravitate towards your gf because she is too different from them - they are looking to make friends with girls of similar interests - fashion, makeup, clubbing - all things they can see your gf knows nothing about. If she wants to have friends like those girls, she needs to try harder to be like them and look like them. She can go on Pinterest or style blogs or youtube for fashion inspiration and makeup tips. I know that sounds harsh to ask her to change the way she looks, but honestly, that is the only option. It doesn't mean giving up everything quirky about herself, but to keep it more subtle and move towards being more conventional. Once she knows more about those girly topics, she can do a better job of carrying on a conversation on topics many girls would be interested in, hence making it easier to get to know them and eventually be their friend. E.g. \"I love how you styled your hair, what kind of curling iron did you use? I'm looking to buy a new one myself.\"\n\nYou mention that your gf is into jewelry making and artsy things. Has she tried joining groups related to those interest topics? Finding girls who share her interest is the best way to make friends, as long as she takes it SLOW. She has to make sure she gets to know them a significant number of times (at least 5-10) before asking if they want to hang out one-on-one. She can't come off as being desperate - that's worse of a turn off than anything. Also, it may sound strange but I've heard of people making friends by posting a friend wanted ad on Craigslist. There are sections specific for girls looking for a platonic friendship with other girls. Otherwise there are all kinds of sites or groups like meetup.com.\n\nAnd as someone who's been there and had an incredibly lonely childhood, it doesn't have to be like that forever. I met my husband in my fourth year of college (one of my many new friends that year) and he was incredibly social with tons of friends so I met even more people through him. Nowadays, it's shocking but people perceive me as being quite popular with a ton of friends. Part of that is overcompensating (making up for a childhood of no friends by wanting everyone to be my friend). In reality, I have a ton of acquaintances and not many super close friends, but that's something I intend to work harder on. I still have difficulty showing my vulnerable side and really letting people in. \n\nAlso, I just started seeing a counselor for a few reasons, including childhood trauma and how it led to me closing off from people. It has been an amazing experience, if you're able to find the right person. It will help her understand what's at the root of her problem with making friends. You say she's not interested in asking for help but you really do need to encourage her to try it again especially since you're worried about her and that she seems depressed. That's something to take very very seriously. If you try everything and she's still not willing to go, you should speak with a counselor on her behalf to get advice on how you can best help her.\n\nAnyhow, I hope that helps a bit and that your gf recovers from this situation and manages to celebrate her birthday with you. Please do look into counseling asap since that sounds like the most important next step for her. Best of luck to you both.",
            "I'm sorry, OP. I think that she will find friends, she's just maybe in a bad environment to find people who mesh with her. She'll find some people. I've been in her situation where I've had a lot of acquaintances but not a lot of \"true\" friends. Maybe now she'll feel less pressured about making friends and they'll pop up. Can she come across as pushy? Or a little in your face maybe? I'm just guessing because if she really has no friends, maybe there's something that's scaring new people away? Either way they sound like dicks and I hope everything works out for her.\n\nIn the meantime I agree with the other comments, talking to a therapist would really be in her best interest. And maybe you can do something to really surprise her.",

            "Omg. OP if you are cool with letting reddit know where you live.. I'm sure there is a party full of people here, including me, that would make your gfs birthday awesome if they're in the same city. ",
            "First, you gotta do something special for her. It's her birthday!! Do something dorky, like get her a huge batch of enormously large balloons. Surprise her in the morning with homemade breakfast. Get her a cake in her favorite flavor and sing to her even if your voice is completely wretched. Make her a special dinner, or take her somewhere really nice and romantic for a special meal. You said she'd love advice on hair and makeup-- call the MAC counter at the mall, or a salon and schedule her a makeover and a blowout before dinner so she feels beautiful. You said she likes making jewelry-- find a nice bead store and pick out some things for her, or let her choose what she'd like. \n\nMy mom was like this one year for her birthday. We surprised her with a special cake (and got sparkler candles, sang even me and my sister's voices suck), launched confetti party poppers at her, and prepared a HUGE dinner with all her favorites. Even though she'd been sad and not in the mood to celebrate, this lifted her mood a TON and she loved it and gradually opened up and was her usual chatty self again.\n\nTake it one step at a time. Do something special for her for the day, then focus on getting her socially adept enough to make good friends. ",
            "I agree with the other commenters who are saying that counselling would be a good help. \n\nHowever, her birthday is soon and you NEED to make it special. Even if she says she wants space, tell her how much YOU want to see her. Tell her that birthdays are important, especially turning 21, and that you want to do something for her. If she is feeling less than stellar, you don't need to make a big hurrah, but at least treat her to something. Take her out for a fancy cocktail and some cake, get her some flowers and a heartfelt card, give her your gift. Birthdays mean a lot to some people, and I think that she needs a little extra this year. \n\nIt is tough making friends, but show her that she always has a friend in you and that this will pass. There are a lot of other comments here giving advice for the future, but I think you really need to focus on the now. Shower her with affection and compliments and be silly together. Getting her out of this funk will make for a great birthday, and she will always remember your kindness during this difficult time. ",
            "Op have you tried reaching out to your local subreddit? My city has meetups every few days and a lot of really tight knit group of friends has been formed from the few years its been active.  ",
            "it sounds like she may be setting herself up for failure in the friends department by:\n\n1. trying too hard, too soon when meeting people\n\n2. then putting potential friends through a series of \"tests\" (will they keep being friends even if i do . . . )\n\n3. deciding too quickly that they aren't real friends, and backing off instead of just hanging out nearby and being non-threatening and approachable. \n\n4.  focusing on getting others to be friends with you, instead of on being a friend to them. ",
            "It sounds like your GF is confusing whether or not people like her with whether or not they want to attend a party. Those are profoundly different things. I don't want to make you feel bad because you sound like a good boyfriend but if you are a quiet, keep to yourself kind of guy, you probably don't inspire people that you aren't very close with to want to come party with you. If my good friends tell me they are having a small party, and it sounds like a boring awkward event, I won't go. It's not a slight on them, but if I know I'm not gonna have fun, I'm probably not going to subject myself to that. I can relate to you, I'm introverted by nature and I prefer to stay home and do the things I enjoy. That's why when I host social events my wife does the planning and inviting. I think your heart is in the right place, but not everyone was born to throw raging parties, or even just entertain guests. \n\nHere's my 2 cents, take it or leave it. Go to wherever your GF is right now. Tell her you've been thinking about it, and you think she's been looking at it all wrong. Apologize that you aren't a great party thrower (you don't have to agree with me, just apologize) and you think that's probably why the party was a bust. Tell her you want to pick an activity (the movies, out to dinner, a theme park, whatever) and you will both invite some friends to that. When you invite the friends tell them \"hey me and 'GF' are going out to dinner with a couple friends, will you come with us?\" If your GF is a nice person like you say, most people will agree to go to a specific activity, even if you are casual friends.\n\nContrary to pop culture, throwing parties is not the best way to make friends. Parties are a good way to have fun with people you are already friends with. If my best friend asked me to come to his dorm (I'm too old for dorms, but just pretend) to hang out with his quirky introverted GF and him to sip beers, I would say no way. If that same friend said hey me and GF are down at the pub playing pool, come have a beer for her Bday, I'm there no question. Find activities or interests you share. Find current friends or new friends with those same interests and build from there.\n\nedit: words",

We both graduated this year.\n\nWhat she said about you making the best of her situation is key. I used to be bothered by not having as many close friends as others, but focusing on my boyfriend helped. I realised that even though I didn't have a normal amount of friends, I had another type of relationship that a lot of my high school friends/acquaintances don't have. Do something with her on her birthday that shows her that she can enjoy herself with just the two of you. Bring her something that makes her feel really special to YOU. You obviously care about her a lot, so if you can show her that she's the most important person in the world to someone, she won't be able to help feeling happy, at least for a bit.\n\nYou can also remind her that things always change. I don't know what you guys are planning once you graduate, but my boyfriend and I will be moving, likely across the country or even to another country. She might end up with more like-minded people in a new job or graduate school or whatever she ends up doing later. Remind her of that, and tell her to focus on the good things in her life for now, like you.",
            "Dude... I... First of all, I'm really sorry you're going through this. Both of you. I know it must be very emotionally draining. I agree with those who have said that it's not that she's meant to not have friends. Not at all.  \n  \nHaving said that, I want to say/ask something with all due respect and knowing I know nothing about you, guys. Has she ever had friends? Like real friends? I mean... I've known a few people who desperately wanted to have friends but never did. And... it was kind of their fault. Not on purpose, but the way they are, the way they act. It just wasn't inviting.  \n  \nDo you know anyone, even your roomates if necesario, who you can have an open and very honest discussion on why she might have no friends? Maybe there IS something and you guys don't see it.  \n  \nDon't take me for an asshole. Swear I'm not. I just think if there actually is something about her or both of you, and you're informed of this, you could at least know and not give a fuck or try to change.  \n  \nHaving said that, she does sound depressed. Please look after her and DO NOT. LEAVE HER. ALONE.",
            "Your GF needs you more than ever tomorrow. Don't make a spectacle, she's clearly not in the mental space for it. Do something thoughtful; make her her favorite dinner, maybe flowers or candles she likes. Something thoughtful to *prove* to her that she's worth the thought and emotional investment. \n\nShe feels useless/unwanted right now, and showing her through small, quiet actions is the best way to shut down those doubts. There will come a time to have a conversation about what to do going forward, but that's not for tomorrow. Tomorrow is about her. Celebrate her. Show her why you love her. That'll mean more to her than a party of 1000 fake friends. ",

            "This makes me really sad...if I were her, I would really appreciate a nice romantic gesture on my birthday. I know she said she wants to be alone, but I think it will help make her feel loved and appreciated if you surprise her with something.  \n\nI know you've tried to get people to come, but maybe you can get a couple people to agree to go to dinner on her birthday. \n\nIf my roommate I wasn't close to said \"hey, my girlfriend is bummed about not having anything for her birthday...would you mind coming with us to her birthday dinner?\" I would probably go. The only reasons not to are if I'm a total asshole, or I just don't care for the couple involved. \n\nThat being said,  if you've lived together several years and don't really consider them friends, that's pretty weird to me. I'm totally guessing at what your roommate relationship is, but if you're the roommate that just does his own thing and doesn't make a point of trying to be friends with your roommates, then I would feel annoyed with being asked to go to a party for his girlfriend. From his perspective, you don't make much of an effort to be friends, but now that you need people for a party, you start acting like a friend? \n\nYou've expressed that you aren't really interested in making friends, and that's fine. But it's hard to be in a couple when one person doesn't want to make friends and the other does. It sounds like she may have some issues to work out, but if you're serious about her and she wants to make friends and be more sociable, then you have to do it with her.",

For some people, it happens in high school, for others it happens in their college years, and for many people, it happens after that, once they've figured out all that weird 'becoming something like an adult' bullshit.\n\nBoth of you are still really young, and life can change very quickly at the most unexpected times.  Just because she (and you) don't have a lot of friends right now doesn't mean that it will always be that way.  Be good people, do interesting things, and eventually it will work out.",

            "I feel like reading the OP and what you've written here about your girlfriend is like looking back at my freshman year of college.  Even the \"some people aren't meant to have friends,\" line.  Like, I don't know what you can do because no one did it for me.  It gets better because heart-break after heart-break will eventually result in her having friends.  She thinks she's giving up now, but if I'm as right about her going through what I went though, that will probably give way to renewed, though far more hesitant and cautious, effort.  It gets better.\n\nIn the mean time, listen to her.  Give her a safe space to cry and even mope.  Then take her to bowling, or dinner, or concerts, places where she can choose to stick close to you in safety or explore for new acquaintances.\n\n(Personal note for her: Maybe try a campus ministry?  I know that's where I found a lot of my first friends in college.  The people in most are warm and wanting to protect as many young students from this kind of sorrow as possible.)",

Her school likely has someone who specializes in exactly this sort of thing (like I said, it is pretty damn common).",
            "I didn't have anyone to celebrate my birthday with when I was 21. It was heartbreaking. I made bad friend choices when I was younger and when I tried to change myself for the better it took a couple years to create a new support system. Please don't leave her alone, I know you have the best intentions so despite what she says I know she wants you to be there for her. She has faced a lot of rejection and is probably trying to be proactive and not set herself up for more, no matter how safe you seem to be. I would have a couple activities in mind, starting with small things like getting food that will maybe cheer her up and lead to something else afterwards, gradually turning into a good day for her. Start early, maybe show up with flowers and ask her to get breakfast, nothing that seems like too big of plans, but keep things and ideas up your sleeve and take her lead. You seem like a great person for her to have in her life and I hope she comes around and you all have a wonderful day. ",
            "I don't know much about her and so I don't know if this is good advice.\n\nShe seems like an introvert and it seems like she's never been really let down before (or maybe this was the last straw). If this is the case she can't let this disappointment define who she is now and who she will become. She needs to forgive the people she thought were her friends and make friends.\n\nThis isn't easy. She should go to a psychologist or counselor for this. There's a stigma about it but really all it does is allow a safe place for you to vent and the other person will equip you with how to cope and deal with this and other situations.\n\nI don't know how serious about her you are, but if she doesn't want to go suggest going in with her for the first couple of times and talk to the psychologist/counselor and find out how you can help her through this rough patch. \n\nI've done counseling before with my wife and it's helped her and I communicate and fight better. I also learned how I can support her with what she's going through.\n\nEdit: with respect to her birthday, don't bring up that no one rsvp'd, don't bring up the party and don't make it seem like you are trying to make up for it.

For me all that happened was I was irritated that I was around a bunch of people I didn't want to be around and took the opportunity to start burning bridges with everyone and pushing everyone away that was there.\n \nBut for what to do I cannot really give much advice (I'd do it myself).  The best thing you could really do is keep her active or actively going out to public places, bars, coffee, food, whatever.  Don't let her start to nest because all that will lead to is more depression, social anxiety  and most likely will lead to you two not being together.

If someone was cool I might occasionally invite them to a party, but you've got to remember, she's not going to be good enough friends with people to go to a movie night right away, and if she turns down a party invite saying she doesn't drink I doubt they're going to try again (I would just figure she didn't want to be around it, but in college it's everywhere so Id conclude she didn't want to be part of my friend group).\n\n A party, or maybe a bar, is more of a casual social setting where people literally go to talk and hang out and meet people.

I know when I can approach a group of people, I know when someone's tired of talking to me, I know if I said something someone doesn't agree with, and I know if someone is genuinely interested in my story) and putting myself outside my comfort zone (if you change your mind on the alcohol, it really helps with this part. Just don't be soppy...1 or 2 drinks is plenty for a non drinker). But I now consider myself to be a very outgoing person. \n\nAnd it's literally as easy as walking up, extending your hand for a handshake, and saying \"hi, I don't believe we've met. My name is X, and this is my girlfriend Y\", how are yall doing tonight? Just don't latch on to the conversation. Talk until there is a natural break, say \"well it was nice meeting you man, we'll see you around\" and go find someone else to talk to.

            "It seems a lot of comments are focusing on her state of mind, and not on the fact that you both don't have too many friends. You need to help her, by helping yourself first. You have to make an effort to make friends and include her along the journey. \n\nShe can be unhappy because of her major or a ton of other things,  but look most people are unsure of what they want to do in college As someone who just graduated, I think I only know a handful of people who are truly passionate about their career. But the main issue isn't her major or anything else except her friend circle not being there.\n\nYou two need to sign up for clubs and activities. You both need to get away from social media, get away from the internet, from books, from everything that can keep you inside. You both need to go out and experience other humans. Go to a random concert or play. Only use the internet for researching things to do. Throw them all in a hat and do one or two each week at least.\n\nExperience the world and other humans because that is what can make us most happy. We are social creatures. ",
            "Tell her you're going out and to be ready by X:00 o'clock.\n\nEither show up at her dorm with flowers (in a vase if she doesn't have one).  You can get a nice arrangement at most larger grocery stores for $6-$20 plus $6 or so for a basic glass vase.  As long as its not stretching the budget include a nice happy birthday balloon with the flowers.\n\nMake reservations at a sit down restaurant in town, the type that you think you'd need a reservation for.\n\nIgnore all the other issues and have a nice special eventing with her.  Set up a little photo album on your phone with photos of fun times the two of you have had together.\n\nIf you do nothing else, then at least do the flowers part.  ",
            "If only you two were in Oregon - I'm a lot like her in that I'm a shy extrovert who loves to be around people but I was always a bit slow to build friendships. It got a lot better as I got older, and I made more friends - now I have an incredible set of friends, but it took me some time. \n\nI would totally hang out with her if you guys lived near me.",
            "When I was all alone on my birthday (somewhere in my teens) because I had cut ties with all my best friends, I was honestly suicidal but tried to hide it. Then my grandparents and some friends came by and surprised me with birthday cakes. I bawled and I didn't feel like I was forgotten by the entire world. Which is what kind of position I think she's in. Honestly, I don't think she'd get that much from a party of people she doesn't know that well so all's not lost. If you just get her a birthday cake, a card, or some physical gift... I think that'd be enough. It would show that you care and that no matter what, you'd be there for her.",
            "I would TotAlly come to her party",
            "Awww. I just want to hug her. D: I'd love to contact her and tell her Happy Birthday!, and that people inherently care and want to help her and befriend her. It's hard to see past our own suffering sometimes to see when someone needs a friend, so I hope she isn't too discouraged.",
            "I'm a little late, but I feel like I identify with the issues shes facing, so I should probably say something.\n\nIf her sadness continues unabated after a week or month, she may be spiraling into serious depression. Which you should be very concerned about. You should take some time to talk to counselors for advice and see what your options are, if things start to really go downhill, it's best not to be totally lost.\n\nI would also suggest that you make it clear that you haven't met anyone at your school that you would consider friend material either. Then take her out to non-college social events where you wont be surrounded basically by careless children. Maybe a book club.. Hell maybe even try getting a boardgame group going.\n\nI would also talk to her about her engineering decision. She obviously isn't enjoying it and it seems to be another large burden she is dealing with. See if you can work with her to find a different path thats actually enjoyable for her. It's a huge mistake going into a field you hate, which I figured out way too late, and the frustration made my other issues seem way bigger than they were.\n\nThe last thing I think you want to do in this situation is make her feel like you pity her or that you are throwing a pity party in her honor. \n\nYou both need to get out and figure out a thing you can do together on a regular basis, which involves being social with other people.\n\nIt seems like its just the initial getting to know people that is the problem, a regular event with the same people involved can eventually help with that. It should encompass something that she loves to talk about, eventually she will forget about making friends and just talk to other people at the event. Then make friends or at least acquaintances she can talk to about similar interests.\n\nI hope things work out for the best!",

I was expecting my friends from school to come as they had RSVP'd yes, but after 3 hours, it was pretty clear no one was coming.\n\nOP, I know how much that sucks. At least you can be there for her and take care of her. Even though she might not want to do something crazy for her b-day, take her for breakfast or dinner and make a day of it doing whatever she wants, even if it's just chilling in her room watching Netflix and eating junk food.\n\nIf y'all are ever in MD, hit me up, I make a mean birthday cake (:",
            "I keep coming back to this post. Your GF sounds just like me. I tell my husband that my super-power is being stood up by people my age. \n\nI think the worst part of what your GF is going through is that a single rejection is no big deal, but after a while they start to  add up in your head and culminate. A friend standing you up for coffee starts taking on the baggage of all the other rejections and ignored offers to meet until the emotional reaction is no longer proportional to the event. That single event of a friend standing you up becomes incredibly devastating because it carries all the weight of the other rejections in the past. It's soul crushing to be rejected by your peer group so openly, especially on your birthday. That birthday becomes a big monument dedicated to how much no one gives a shit and it sucks.\n\nYou want to stop trying, stop reaching out, but when you do the pure dead silence of not a single person caring or reaching out makes you want to jump back in, desperation be damned, or just kill yourself.\n\nPersonally, when I was going through what your GF is experiencing, I started making friends with people outside my age group. I feel like that helped. I externalized my social life so it revolves around events and common interests instead of just relationships. I started volunteering at a garden and the older ladies there were more than happy to become my friends and chat. My older neighbor is a gardener with many cool stories to tell and we trade plants. I go to an Episcopal church where everyone is happy to see everyone. All of this has built my confidence back up and I don't sit around ruminating about what a broken nasty person I must be for failing to have a bunch of close girlfriends. I still feel bad about it, I actually got stood up just today by a girl and it sucks, but I don't feel like a 100% worthless POS when it happens like before. \n\nYour a good boyfriend, I hope everything goes well tomorrow. I'm rooting for your GF, it is a terrible thing for her to be going through on top of her regular college woes. :(",

We play smash together, we go to the movies about once a month, and once in a while he stays over at my house to play video games and watch TV with me. My sister and I aren\u2019t as close. She is more into makeup, and isn\u2019t interested in video games much if at all. She also works as a waitress when she isn\u2019t at school, typically 6-8 hours a day on the weekends. I still love her just as much as my brother, I just don\u2019t think we have many common interests at this point in our lives, and our availability doesn\u2019t match up much. I found out from my mom today that the last time I hung out with my brother, she told my parents that she feels like I don\u2019t like her because I don\u2019t spend as much time with her as I do with my brother. How can I make her feel more included in what my brother and I are doing, without making it too obvious that I know what she told my parents? Or should I just take her to lunch one day and tell her I know what she told them, and that she is always welcome to hang out with me?\n\n\nTLDR: Sister is feeling left out because my brother and I hang out often and she doesn\u2019t/isn\u2019t able to join. How do I make it clear to her she is welcome to hang out with me/us any time?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the input guys.

            "It's just easier for you to bond with your little bro because you guys share so many interests - if you are interested in building a stronger relationship with your lil sis, maybe try doing something she likes once in a while....or just take her someone to walk and talk, and when you think you can slip in that you'd love to see her over at your place more often, and that she's more than welcome - she's invited, if that's what she needs to hear! - to come over.",
            "I think you, as the eldest sibling, have a lot more power here than you think you do. You can initiate and foster strong relationships between you and each of your siblings - and between your siblings, too. \n\nPeople are advising you to do more group activities with both of them together. And advising you to spend more one-on-one time with your sister. You should try to do both. \n\nSaying you don't have much in common and are busy are cop-outs. You can make time. And you can invent common interests. \n\nFor group activities, try new things together, take your little brother out of his comfort zone and do something other than games and movies. If you do activities that are new to all of you, then you'll be on more equal footing. Don't pick something only he likes or only she likes. Do something crazy that none of you like, haha. \n\nFor activities with her, come up with ideas to take her out and to do at home (similar to the movie theater and games and tv at home, like you do for your brother). For going out, it can be as simple as taking her to lunch, or taking her to a live show (music, or live theater maybe? She likes makeup, maybe she likes costumes and drama and people? idk, ask her). For staying in, if she likes makeup, it sounds like she might be creative and/or crafty. Ask her if she wants to do a jigsaw puzzle, or bake cookies,  or learn to knit, or make jewelry. Stay off the screens and try to find something that you're mildly interested in that she also likes.",
            "Maybe you could find an activity you will both (or all three of you) enjoy, like roller skating or hiking. The more you hang out together, the easier it will be to find more things you have in common. Letting sis do your makeup or give you a makeover might be really fun even if you aren\u2019t into makeup and all that.",
            "You could try and ask for her help with something shes interested in. \nFor example you could tell her you need advice finding make up for you or a gift for someone else and go shopping with her and spend some time together.",
            "You don't need to reveal that you know what she spoke to your parents about... while I think it was important your parents told you so you can fix it, it might deter your sister from going to them about problems in the future. \n\nIt's okay that you're closer to one sibling than the other, it happens. But I'm sure there's common ground you could find with your sister too. Maybe include her in the movie dates sometimes if you can all agree on something to see, or set time aside for a monthly dinner/lunch with your sister. You say she's not into video games but gaming is a very wide spectrum -- maybe she wouldn't enjoy, say, the Xbox... but she'd love a fun match with you on something like the Wii, etc. Plus there's lots of fun activities that the three of you could try together, especially with Christmas approaching (since there tends to be things like Christmas markets, ice-skating, other holiday events, etc). Outside of that you could also do fun sporty things that most people have the potential to enjoy even if they don't consider themselves active and sporty, like the ice-skating, or wall/rock climbing, or swimming (my cousins and I go swimming but essentially we go just to piss around in the pool and be silly rather than swim for exercise lol).",
            "My brother plays video games, I don't. But I made an effort to play a few games with him.  In turn he made an effort to see some movies with me.\n\nIt's about compromise.  You make an effort to spend time with her and the rest will follow. \n\n\nOn the other hand, I tried making an effort to spend time with my cousins but they don't want to spend time with me.  As such I feel I don't have any kind of relationship with them.  \n\n\nYou decide what you want.",
            "It really sucks when your siblings are closer to each other than you, especially if she feels you make more of an effort with your brother than with her. \n\nI don't have that much in common with one of my little sisters but we're still close - I make sure text her regularly to catch up and make sure she knows I care about her. Even if you don't have shared interests you can still ask about each other's interests and do things together.",
            "I mean, have you considered learning why she likes the interests she's into? I'm definitely someone who enjoys a good video game, but makeup is like wizardry to me. I don't understand it at ALL and I'm super impressed by anyone who can do it. Maybe try branching out and validating what she's into even if it's not your usual interests. It means a lot to have your sister appreciate you on that level. My sister is 110% different than me and I still feel kind of alienated from her even when she reaches out because she has little to no appreciation for the things I enjoy.",
            "I think you don't try to include her in what you and your brother are doing, mostly.  Your sister doesn't want to play video games, so don't invite her for that.  I think you could invite her to see a movie with you guys more though.  I think that making it clear that she's welcome to join you in doing things you know she doesn't want to do isn't the same thing as reaching out and trying to have a relationship with her.  Surely you guys can go walk in a park together, or go to lunch together, or something that isn't video games?  Maybe ask for her to give you her schedule so that you can pick a couple of times, and then let her pick what you guys are doing.  Maybe you'll learn a little bit about her, maybe you have some things in common that you don't even know.",
            "You can take her out without talking about what she told to your parents. It's easier spending time with your brother bc you guys like the same stuff, but what you can do is show interest with what your sister like. Maybe you guys find something in comon too.",
            "She likely doesn\u2019t just want to hang out with you two. Tell her you realize how it looks and that\u2019s really not how it is, and you\u2019d like to take her for coffee; what time works? It doesn\u2019t have to be marathon visits. Small check ins work well. That way it\u2019s not \u201cyou can come watch us play ...if you want\u201d.",
            "I am the middle sibling and am similar to you that I hang out with my little bro more than my big sis. I still love her immensely and make sure that we get time together. I think your little sister feels excluded because it's literally that her other two siblings are hanging out without her. I remember my sister telling me similarly. \n\nI just created a \"siblings\" group chat after that and ask if they want to hang out there. It's easier to plan days we can all hang out too then, cause everyone can just drop their schedule in it at the beginning of the week. My bro and I will still hang out and game and she will read it and choose to sit it out or not. She still does come over to watch games occasionally if it's a better \"spectator\" game like something spooky. I just think it's better to be inclusive and they can decide if they will be bored on their own. Have you ever _tried_ inviting your sister to your game/movie/tv nights? Especially with movies and tv, those aren't really \"exclusive\" activities. I'm sure she'd come along if you asked.",
            "I would not tell her they told you. Your sister wants you to hang out with her because you want to, not because you were \"told to\". I know that's not why you are doing it, but she might think so. That might just hurt as well. Find out what you guys have in common. Me and my sister don't have a lot in common but we have a great relationship. We sometimes go out for ice cream and meet up for coffee. We also usually have one TV series we only watch together. It takes us longer to finish it, but it's worth it. We don't like all the same TV shows, but it's always possible to find something we both like. She is a lot into Korean TV shows and I'm not. I gave it a chance and we found one series I really liked!",
            "Hi I can kinda relate to your sister. I\u2019m the sister in between an older and younger brother who hang out a lot and tend to leave me out. I used to work a fast food job similar hours to your sister and when I\u2019d get home, I\u2019d hear about how my brothers went out to the mall or to eat or downtown and it would make me feel even more defeated after a long day of work. \n\nAcknowledge your sister, invite her even if you know she\u2019s gonna be busy it shows that y\u2019all are thinking about her and that she was remembered. Maybe even strike about conversations about \u201cbeauty\u201d things, don\u2019t just outright dismiss it as makeup. You could ask her about skincare or like many others have said go get a mani/pedi together. \n\nYou\u2019re the older sister you have more influence than you know. Try working on it now so y\u2019all can truly be siblings and not just share the same blood.\n\nEdit: sister not brother",

I bring my little cousins to a craft store near me (expense varies) a couple times a year to paint clay figures and get them finished up in the bellows because they really like arts and crafts. \n\nTaking a day trip somewhere might be fun as well. If you live within driving distance of a state park or the ocean you could rent bikes (~$10 an hour) and take a ride plus a bite to eat and talk. \n\nShe expressed a wish to have your time, so you might connect with her over something as simple as a lunch date and ask her about her life, hopes, etc. \n\nAlternatively just ask her if she would want to spend some time doing something together and see what she says.",
            "Younger sister in the same situation here!\n\nJust call her and tell her you want to spend more time with her and then spend more time with her that's all.\n\nYou don't need to worry about not being obvious that you know, because if that's something she thought about you very well could have as well.

So, it doesn't matter how this lunch began, what matters is what we do after I pay the check, and that starts with us talking about what we WANT more of, what might be fun for us to do, and if maybe we should figure out how all 3 of us can spend more time. Just... bro is 14 so... we might need to indulge his interests for a few years. :p\"",
            "Not much she can really do besides putting her interests and work aside if she wants to have a bond with you or your brother. It's her decision to choose her time over you guys.

My brother and I have always been super close because of similar interests, like video games, anime, etc. My sister thinks we're \"weird\". But honestly, as we've grown up and our interests have diversified, we've found a lot more common ground. Once a week now, I go to her place so we can cook together :) and we're all going to Italy together in a couple of days! It gets better, you just need to try and find some commonality in something!:)",
            "My brother is 14, and I\u2019m 24, we both play smash together too and bond a lot more than my other little brother. Both of them still come over, but it\u2019s obvious between us that my 14 year old brother and I are closer because we like the same things. \n\nSiblings just have different personalities, you shouldn\u2019t force yourself to make up for being human.",
            "it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s \u201cweird\u201d about your relationship with your brother, it sounds like she just wants a closer relationship with you.",
            "I think this boils down to a misconception we have about love. I know for the longest time I felt unloved by someone in my family. But that is because I, like most people see love as a value to be weighed. When most of the time we spend feeling like someone doesn't love us as much or enough. We are missing out on that people can love each other in different ways. You can't possibly love two people in an equal and exact amount. To your situation though she is just young and should give some thought to how she defines love. That is nice to know she cares enough to seek council, knowing full well it would get back to you. Shows that she is trying.",

            "Take her to lunch and tell her you want to spend time with her but you know she doesn't like video games, so you need need to figure out something you're both interested that you can do together. It doesn't have to be things you already do . Maybe you both take up a brand new interest and learn about it together. There's gotta be something you can do together.",
            "I'm a lot like you, but older (40f) but I've been playing video games since I got my first original Nintendo.  Have so many games on Steam, married a gaming streamer so I understand.  I bet your brother would be a good sport to cheer her up too.  How about you all three do some skin care, like green face masks and give your bro a makeover.  What a great memory that would be for the 3 of you and it would be lighthearted and also help her know she is loved too.  I do hope you try this because I wanna see pictures!  Let me know if you do!",
            "I never had siblings so I don\u2019t really have any advice and I think you\u2019ve got it covered now anyway, I just want to say I think you sound like a wonderful, thoughtful person and a great sister, to both your brother AND your sister, and I think your family is very lucky to have you.",
            "I have six siblings. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned about maintaining relationships, is that you need to develop some kind of enthusiasm for their interests, even if they don\u2019t immediately appeal to you. For example, my sister got into geography and rocks when I was a teenager, and was really excited about it. At the time I was more into art and music, and if I did anything in the sciences it was usually related to animals and plants. But I listened to her talk about her new obsession and I recalled what I\u2019d learnt a few years back in one of my science book binges and it developed from there. I actually gained a huge appreciation for mineralogy and now I\u2019m as obsessed with rocks and minerals as she is. If you do this with your sister, at the very least, you\u2019ll learn something new. You\u2019ll also get to see your sister enthusiastic about something.\n\nThing is, your sister isn\u2019t upset you\u2019re not into the same things she is. She\u2019s upset that she doesn\u2019t observe an effort on your part to understand her interests and at least learn about them. You and your sister are growing into new and amazing people. Engage with her and join in the growth, because you will both benefit from sharing your journeys together.\n\nAs far as telling her what your Mum said, I don\u2019t see the point, really. The important thing is to put into action some bonding time with your sister.",

            "u/Hacker_man_29 I'd suggest you one thing, it's fine if she doesn't play video games, she can still be with you guys when you play. If she is around you when you guys are having fun it becomes a cherishable memory for her no matter what. Call her and have fun with her. Ask her for make up tips cause you might need em sometimes I think, even if you don't, it'll make her feel nice. Small things go a long way",
            "My sister and I are polar opposites. I\u2019m more feminine and she\u2019s been the Tom boy. She likes video games, anime( I introduced her to it, I like it but she takes it to another level), cartoons and other things. But her and I we\u2019ve always taken the time to do things that the other likes. \nFor example, I\u2019ll sit with her while she watches YouTube on video games, and then she\u2019ll listen to me talk about makeup and do things that she may not necessarily like. But we do it because we want to have a relationship with one another. And honestly, she\u2019s my best friend. She\u2019s the first person I tell anything to. And her, me. \n\nBut guess what, now she likes makeup, and I like video games. It probably wouldn\u2019t have happened had we not taken the time to get to know one another\u2019s hobbies and interests. Now we share more things in common than we don\u2019t. And I love that.",
            "Ask her out for food. That's a very common thing that everyone wants to go get, you both have that common interest.",
            "can you invite her to your place for a movie/spa night? nails, face mask, snacks. i'm an older sibling, but if i was a younger sib, i think it'd be extremely cool to stay at their place for a night every two weeks or month. or maybe you cook together, bake together, etc. spa/baking/cooking is so nice because it gives you an activity where you can talk during it, and something to talk about when the conversation kind of lulls.\n\nin addition to that, you could always ask if she wants to get coffee or come over before/after work, etc. but i really think you'll have to carve out some time rather than an open invitation. i think she's less likely to take you up on the latter and might feel like a tagalong. \n\ni'd approach her with a few different ideas and see what she likes. i would also consider having it just be one on one time with her, because she might feel left out if it's the three of you. i think she'll feel a lot better with a set time for the two of you. and it gives her something to look forward to, too. \n\ngood luck to both of you OP! it sounds like you and your sister are headed in the right direction.",
            "There's a group on Facebook named Relationship Debates, check it out it may help you.",
            "Even if you dont share similar interests, it doesnt mean you can't show her love. The solution is probably as simple as talking to her more and telling her you care more often. You dont need to indulge in her hobbies or force her to enjoy yours, just be present in her life. She just wants you to be a part of her life.",
            "Coming from someone who was the left out sibling in this situation, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's important to just ask them, even if they don't want to participate in games/movies/etc. My family used to sometimes go out to eat with the rest of my family and not even come upstairs to invite me. Even if I didn't want to go (which I always would have), I just wanted to be asked.",
            "Hi! I think I can relate to you. I  have 5 siblings. I am very close pretty much like how you are to your brother to each of them. It was struggle at first because I get along with my 3 brothers too! From my experience the reason why I got closer to my 2 sisters now is that I put a little effort to be more thoughtful with them. I try to remember the things she like & hangout (tagging along my other brothers) even at first it feels awkward, in the long run we got closer.  My sisters gets to decide where to eat, even if we're not much fond of her choice.  I practice listening to her stories, and get curious to things she's interested. I also try to explain game stuffs and how it works (a little bit) so she can laugh somehow along with us if my brothers and I are goofing around especially if its game related. \n\nWell, I hope this helps & Goodluck!",
            "There's 10 years between my sister and I. Some of our interests overlap, some don't, and I think our personalities are a little different too but she's one of my best friends and having her in my life is top priority.\n\nI think she watches a load of dumb crap on YouTube sometimes, but I'll still sit downstairs whilst she's watching it and ask her questions about it, even if it's not super my thing. I'll also sit with her whilst she's watching Netflix and after awhile I started getting into things like The Vampire Diaries and American Horror Story. Maybe find a series you and your sister can watch together or one you don't mind sitting through an episode of randomly?\n\nAlso YouTubers. I watch some gamer channels too but also Jenna Marbles and Simplynailogical, who are both hilarious and do a mix of things. They've got some funny beauty videos you and your sister might enjoy? There's also Madeyewlook and Glam and Gore.\n\nHope this helps a bit!",
            "I think honesty is best here. Not BLUNT honesty however, just make it clear you didnt understand that she was feeling left out and you didnt mean to exclude her.  \n\nI'm mostly talking about saying that your folks brought it up. From what I can read here all you have to say is that you care about her and your relationship with her. Make it clear she can always talk to you about anything and you wont judge or hold it against her.  If she doesn't share interests or hobbies with you that it's ok and you still care about what shes interested in. I think you get the point here.",

For me it\u2019s just not that we have common interests, sometimes it\u2019s just our personalities that click. For example, my eldest brother and I are in the same career and we like the same sports teams but we\u2019re not very close because our personalities just don\u2019t go together. Yours sounds less complicated because you seem to know why you\u2019re clicking with your bro and not with your sister. An easy solution is making some effort to spend quality time together. It doesn\u2019t have to involve your hobbies, just sitting down and talking about life. If it\u2019s your personalities that just don\u2019t click, then there\u2019s little you can do about it.",

I told him I wanted more communication in the relationship and told him that we could work on it together if he wanted. Essentially he told me he wanted to breakup. Didn\u2019t want to be with me at that time because he needed to find himself and didn\u2019t want to drag me down. Said he needed to do it by himself and he didn\u2019t want me help. So I said that if he really wanted to end it we need to talk on the phone. So after he got off work, he called and we ended it. I told him that I\u2019d be there for him if he needed someone to talk to. Told him he was a good guy and that I liked him as a person. He told me he wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship right now, but he might be in the future. I put my foot down and said that I wasn\u2019t going to wait for him. I needed that phone call for closure and to move on. I need some encouragement advice lol.  I know I\u2019ll be fine as I\u2019ve been through breakups before. It just hurts right now. To me, he seemed like a decent guy. But I guess things don\u2019t always go our way.\n\nTLDR: broke up with bf of 4 months. Said he didn\u2019t want to be in a relationship right now.

            "You did the right thing.  \n\nUnsolicited advice:  don't be his emotional support. First of all, emotional support is a benefit of being in a committed relationship or friendship. You have neither with this guy.  Having been through this myself, I can pretty much guarantee you that if he reaches out, it will be a one-sided friendship, where your giving emotional support helps him, and actually hurts you as it will keep you low-grade connected to him (and therefore not free to move on). You don't need to remain friends with everyone you've every known or dated. It was 4 months. You're young. In 10, 20 years, you probably won't even remember his name.

You create a boundary and said \"this is what I want\".  It wasn't an ultimatum, it wasn't forceful.  It just was broadcasting out your needs and that allowed for him to respond in an open and honest way.

It's cool that you told him that you needed to talk on the phone and not just do it via messages.

One night he came over, took his normal spot at the table and got on his phone while I cooked. I started talking to him, but he said he was busy. I kept cooking until he talked to me and I asked him if he would help out. He replied that he was too tired and just needed to relax. Every night? Bull.

You're so young too, there's no need to take it on. Seriously, therapy and change are a lot of work and it's work they need and want to do anyway, with a professional.\n\nYou're with this young guy just a few months too. And before anyone jumps in with \"you should help your partners in that way.\" Maybe if it's a light issue and you have a life together. That said, imo don't be so eager to offer to help fix men hell, or anyone who can't even bother to be present in your relationship at the easiest part of it. And like I said before you can't really teach anyone basic things like respect and communication anyway because let's be real, people like that know what they are doing, it was obvious lack of serious interest in the relationship.\n\nDon't offer or put yourself through the work or the headache of being that for someone. It doesn't work. It changes the relationship in ways no one wants. And usually while I'm sure they are great people, imo that energy would be better put to use in your life.\n\nEdit: words",
            "Hi OP. Just keep it ended. Don't be a friend. But also, there is no reason to hate him either. Life just hurts and is awful sometimes. He was honest with you. You hang in and hang on until the storm passes.\n\nMaybe in a few years (not a few months or a year! way too soon) you will, by luck or circumstance, run into him again when you are both with someone else, or each happily and freely single. And it would be OK. Any bitterness gone and you remember the good moments and wish the other well. But probably without a desire to restart what was never really right for an LTR or marriage. I wish more exes could walk that path. While understanding sometimes with an abusive ex it is leave and never look back or re-friend, ever.",

I would have realized a lot sooner when they couldn't (or wouldn't) give me what I needed, and that it was time to leave.\n\n\nMy last relationship ended due to him needing \"to work on himself\" too. I foolishly asked back then if we ever had a chance of trying again. He gave a wishy washy response and told me not to wait for him. In retrospect I wish I never asked, because regardless of his response it hindered me from moving on sooner. So you made the right move in not even entertaining the possibility of another chance. It'll hurt for awhile, but that just means you're human and cared. \u2665\ufe0f",

Now that may sound insensitive but the most important relationship you will ever have in your life is with yourself, so now that he has made his choice, you can choose to grow your relationship with yourself. Date yourself. Have some personal time and take care of yourself. Take more than necessary bubble baths. You may not know how much self love you need until you give it to yourself.

I developed a horrible drinking habit where I i was heavily drinking on a nightly basis and never went out to pubs with friends, only by myself. after a talk with one of my closest friends, I realized I had coped incredibly poorly and ended the heavy drinking. they also made me realize that the relationship taught me numerous lessons about being a better listener, more considerate and that communication is vital. the fact that we ended the relationship in a mature and civilized way and I took some important lessons from it, made the break up sting less and I look back at that time as a really good time in my life. I've since grown as an individual and am with a great girl now. if you can take any relationship and learn something from it, then you can look back at the time as a good time in you life and continue to grow as a person.",

When I tried to talk to her about it, and at least get some closure, she ghosted me and then blocked me on social media. Still don't know why, it's hard to get closure without being able to talk to the person at all.\n\nAs other people have mentioned, it gets easier with time. I also want to tell you that it is a privilege to be in your life, and if someone doesn't realize that, it is more of their problem than it is yours. Take what you learned from the relationship, be grateful for the closure you were able to achieve, and move forward into the future.

We go out all the time, are more affectionate, have more fun together, we planned a weekend trip for next month, talk all day through text.

Honestly, to even notice and acknowledge the underlying problem so soon shows some strong sense of self reflection and regulation. Well done!\n\nIt sucks that he may be depressed. But that isn't an adequate excuse for treating you so coldly and callously or for being complacent about attempting to address it. He seemed content to drop his baggage on you without any attempt to control or minimize it's effect on you or your relationship. To me, that seems either very selfish or very dependent and destructive behavior. Especially since it only took less than 2 months for these issues to surface.\n\nIt will hurt and you will miss him or the relationship, but that's normal and will pass. Just remember that a future great relationship will give you those bits of happiness too, but with the added amazingness of reinforcement, comfort, care, and strength reciprocated from an equal partner who wants to be there! That is what you really want and I'm sure you'll find it.\n\nGood luck OP!",

While I was literally addressing the wedding envelopes I had a gut feeling and called the wedding off. He moved out    And hated me. But we stayed in touch, dated on and off and we also dated others.  We dated for 6 more years (!) and finally got married when I was 27. Looking back we were STILL too young (and while I have a wonderful marriage I often regret not having more \u201cme\u201d time to date and just become \u201cme\u201d. We waited 8 more years and had our son. We are about to have our 19th anniversary and things are wonderful. Don\u2019t be heart broken. Become YOU. It\u2019s ok to have boyfriends. Date. Have lots of dates. And date more!  If you and your ex are meant to be then it will happen. But don\u2019t get caught up in the loss. Stay in touch with him as appropriate. You are so young. The woman you are now is not who you will be at 25, 30, 40, 50.  Relationships are so much more than love.  Had we married we most certainly would have divorced.

You held your boundaries and self respect and that is the most important thing to take away from this situation! Don't let anyone ever make you feel like you need to beg for them to want to be with you or that you're not worthy of a respectful, appropriate, adult conversation if you break up. 20yo me would have pitched a fit and let him walk all over me. So good for you!",

They had five kids (including my dad) and have 13 grandchildren- 6 great-grandchildren.  My grandparents are pretty wealthy. They owned three businesses up until last year when my grandpa passed away. I\u2019m the \u201cbaby\u201d of the grandchildren and have always been really close with them. My grandma babysat me until I was able to go to Kindergarten, I wrap her Christmas presents for every one every year, I decorate their house, and I\u2019ve worked at their bar on Friday night\u2019s throughout college (without pay) as they got too old to do these things themselves. All of these things were offered to my cousins but they never helped out.\n \nMy grandparents ran a horse training farm for show horses for over 40 years. This was something my dad took up with them and I quickly started to love. I rode every weekend with my grandma up until high school when I started to get busy. Even though I don\u2019t ride much anymore, my dad and I go out and clean the stalls every week and take care of the horses when my grandparents went on trips (usually every other month).\n \nMy grandparents were a huge part of my life.\n \n \nThe problem:\nMy grandma passed away 4 weeks ago. It was devastating. My grandma left my aunts/uncles/dad about $85,000 each. Money that her and my grandpa worked very very hard for. This was expected. What wasn\u2019t expected was for them to leave me a little over $45,000 along with some other things of value. I was honestly shocked. My cousins all got about $2,000 each and some knick-knacks. Obviously, you can see where this was going. My aunts and uncles were in the reading when I was told so they told their kids. Everyone besides my parents are furious. My cousins (who are adults) are demanding I split it evenly with them. I don\u2019t feel that I have to. I was very close with my grandparents and did a lot for them but this is hard. My family is very tight and we do annual vacations together/monthly parties/dinners/etc. I never expected money would tear us apart. This money could change a lot for me. I could pay off my $10,000 student loan and put the rest toward my upcoming wedding/future children/a savings account. A small part of me wants to divide it evenly just to keep everyone together. BUT there was a reason they left me this. They didn\u2019t do it to hurt anyone. I was the ONLY one to visit them and help them out (none of them took the time to see them aside from family get-togethers) but no one understands that aside from my parents. I feel like I\u2019m single-handedly tearing the family apart. My aunts and uncles won\u2019t talk to my dad unless I split the money and my cousins won\u2019t talk to me. I only have a student loan and car payment so I don\u2019t have much debt but this could set me up for a comfortable future. They all keep throwing in my face that they have families, house payments, college to pay for, etc. They keep saying I\u2019ve been planning this for a long time but I truly haven\u2019t. I loved my grandparents.\n \nMy fianc\u00e9 is telling me to forget about them and to do what\u2019s best for me but I\u2019m a huge family person. I don\u2019t want to split the money (it could really help me) but I feel that they could be playing me by making me choose between them and it.  My parents also want me to keep the money as they feel my family members are being ridiculous by demanding this.\n \nIs it right for me to keep this much? I feel like I deserve it. Is it right for me to put this money over my family? Or are the people who I\u2019ve been so close with my entire life taking advantage of me? $45,000 vs $2,000 is a huge difference.\n \nSo, advice??\n\n\nEDIT: there's more in the will than I explained (houses, classic cars, horses, the farm, land, CD's, etc). The cash/checking accounts that were given to me are the only things that seem to be the problem with everyone. \n\n   \n**tl;dr**: inherited more money than my cousins. They're demanding I split it evenly between then or neve talk to them again.",

            "Absolutely keep all the money. Your cousins think they are entitled just because of lineage. They're not. Your grandparents gave you the money because you were good to them and spent time with them. You deserve the money. They don't. Also, like you said, this money can positively change your life and give you the good start you need. That's what your grandparents intended. If you split it, it's not going to be enough to help anyone. Honor what your grandparents wanted and keep the money. Use that line with your family, in fact. \"Our grandparents wanted me to have this money. I'm going to honor their wishes. I won't be discussing this further. If you want to let something like this tear the family apart, that's your choice.\" Honesty, you see these people a couple of times a year. They might be blood, but they are not your chosen family, and you'll probably find they matter to you less and less as you get older. Don't let their butthurt ruin your chance for a good life. ",
            "First of all, $45,000 split 13 ways isn't going very far at all.  I don't think your cousins have really thought it through, but if your 12 cousins got $2000 each and you got $45000, then there was a total of $69000 given to the grandchildren.  That's a little over $5000 each.  They're seriously going to throw a huge fit about $3000?  Assholes.\n\nBut anyway, fuck them, they're not entitled to your money, and it's a shitty thing for them to do to be greedy bitches about it.  Your fiance and your parents are right, it's your money, and you shouldn't be guilted into giving it away.",
            "Your cousins are showing you who they are through their actions. They are the ones willing to put money over family, not you.

As it is, these are their wishes, and I'll be honoring them as they were expressed.\"\n\nYour grandma didn't have to leave her money to anyone.  She chose you.  The rest of your family is acting entitled (and perhaps a bit guilty), and they need to get over it.",

But not family.  \n\nSecond - this sets a *terrible* precedent of them feeling entitled to what is yours.  What if you work hard, make great money, and one of them comes to you, hat in hand, for half of the money you've worked hard for?  What if that person says \"I'll cut you off forever if you don't give me this now?\"  You'd feel pretty peeved, right?  Well you're setting yourself up for a *lifetime* of these kinds of interactions.  Don't deal with emotional terrorists.  \n\nThird - This is merely you respecting your grandmother's wishes.  You did nothing untoward.  She made the call and was smart enough to make it legally binding.\n\nI think you should say \"It is unfortunate you would let something like this come between us, but this was grandma's wish so I will honor it.  I hope you reconsider and understand if you need some time.  I wish you the best of luck in life and hope I see you some time soon\" and leave it at that.  \n\nTo be clear - these are people that are saying you not giving them $4k/each will result in throwing away a LIFETIME of family memories, interaction, and emotional support.  They are petty and small.  You may not realize this now, but you will be better off with these kinds of people voluntarily opting out of your life.  Four thousand dollars is *nothing* when you think about the expanse of a life and a person's net lifetime income.  ",
            "Even if you split it, they wouldn't be grateful towards you.

            "I'm in the same boat with my great grandparents...I have done so much for them growing up while my cousins/aunts/uncles have refused. I love them dearly and would never complain about helping them because they are wonderful people and are always thankful.\n\nOne time, we had a huge snowstorm of about 24\" or so and my GG's were snowed in completely. My parents weren't around and I was home from college over break. No one would go help to get them out, saying that they too were snowed in (which is bull, my uncle has a plow on his FWD truck) so I drove my tiny ass Chevy over there and did it all myself...My GGrandpa watched me the entire time to make sure I was ok then gave me twenty bucks to go get myself some breakfast. He recently passed and I miss him all the time.\n\nI don't live anywhere close to my hometown where they live, but everytime I come home, I make sure to stop by. Just hearing my great grandma's voice and to see her smile when she sees me walking up to her house makes it all worth it.

You sound like you did a lot for you grandparents and were there for them when they needed it. You didn't ask for this you did expect this. Your grandparents gave everyone the same opportunities and you were the only one who helped out even when time is tight. You owe no one nothing.

Enjoy, and sorry for your loss no amount of money can replace memories.",

Nothing worse than losing your family's support during a time like this. I lost my grandfather and being the only grandchild who visited him regularly to play cards and keep him company his last few years combined with the fact that he and my grandmother raised me after I lost my mother led to me being the only grandchild to receive money. Everyone ignored me at the funeral which really broke my heart, especially coming from the older generations. Some wouldn't even look at me. Money rips families apart. No one cared that I was the only orphan in my family and could have actually used the money since all my cousins were set up with cars and college accounts as young adults and I saw nothing and had to earn all my own money because my parents were deadbeats, literally and figuratively. I even caved and let my cousin live rent free in the house I inherited while he goes to college and it's already backfiring. And I paid rent to his fucking mother, my aunt, starting at 15 when she demanded I get a job, meanwhile he hasn't ever had one at 26. Your grandpa gave his money to who he saw fit and anything else would be disrespecting his wishes. Let them know that. Be strong, and remember what happens when you give a mouse a cookie. Good luck OP",
            "*\"To everyone. I have spent a lot of time with Grandma (name) since I was in Kindergarten. I visited her regularly because I wanted to and enjoyed her. I went to her place and did things for her because I loved and wanted to spend time with her. I did not know what her plans were for her will and never expected anything as the thought of her passing was not something I dwelt on. I would trade all of the money she left and then pay some more if I could have her back for a few more years, but I can't. Since it came out that she chose to leave me some extra money I have been inundated with requests, demands, and threats. The money grubbing is, quite frankly, disgusting. I did not ask for the inheritance that she left me, but I also will not violate her final wishes by caving to the kind of behavior I once thought only existed in soap operas. I hope that everyone can remember Grandma (name) for the awesome person that she was and stop thinking of her like a dead cash cow. She would have been ashamed at the way people are acting and would have wanted us to remain a close family.\"*\n\n*\"So let me make myself abundantly clear. I will abide by Grandma (names) wishes here and will not be swayed. I am willing to let what has already been said pass and not need to discuss it again because we're family and she would have wanted us to stay together and close, but any further insults or demands to disrespect Grandma (name's) final wishes will not be tolerated. If you want to break up the family because you feel that you didn't get a big enough piece of grandma, then your punishment is having to live with the kind of person you are, and my reward will be not having to associate with you. I hope that no one will expose themselves to be that kind of person.\"*",

Which, will give each cousin 3 thousand plus the 2 thousand that they already received. That will barely help anyone, no matter what you do they will never be satisfied.\n\nAlso, they should be happy for you, not unreasonably asking you to give up your inheritance. ",
            "Ok, let's do some math. You said there are 13 grand children. Since each gets $2000, take $2000 out for yourself. That leaves $43000 to be split 13 ways. So your cousins are willing to throw your relationship away for about $3300. Even without being petty with the math, everyone here is right. Personally, I would be more inclined to help them out if they ASKED politely for some money. Instead they are demanding it, acting entitled, and holding your relationship hostage.

We were the ones that took them to the hospitals for surgeries. We were the ones who moved them into one of our houses next door when they could no longer care for themselves so that we could watch over for them (which my grandma almost burnt down smoking on oxygen).

The situation is what it is. It's not uncommon for people to leave a disproportionate amount of inheritance to people they were close to. The fact that some of your family members are not responding in a mature way is not your fault. \n\n-Splitting the money will not fix all the problems. It will not change the fact that your grandma clearly favored you, and everyone knows it. It will not change the fact that your family believes that you *emotionally manipulated your grandmother for money*. It will not change the fact that your family feels entitled to your money. No matter what happens,  there is going to be resentment after the dust settles. \n\n-logically explaining why you deserve the money will absolutely not help. Many people are suggesting you slam your family members with logical arguments. This is not a court case or a high school debate, and people are not computers. The logic in this situation is extremely plain to see, it's clear your family is not receptive to a thoughtful explanation. At this point all you can do is make your decision; you can not control their reaction to it no matter how smart of an argument you can come up with. \n\nI'll be honest, if I were in your situation, I would not speak to anyone who accused me of spending time with a family member with the sole intention  of snagging a juicy inheritance, until they profusely apologized. But it's your decision, if trying to preserve what's left of your family bond is more important to you than the money and the future it can secure you then that's what you should choose. People in this thread are automatically assuming your cousins are money-grubbing gremlins but only you actually know them and they may be more important to you than they understand. \n\nEdit: one last thing, many people are saying that splitting the money would be ignoring your grandma's wishes. This is wrong. Your grandma gave you the money to do whatever you want with it, whether that's securing your future, helping your family, or blowing it on coke and hookers.",

She and my great-grandpa worked their tails off and never had a lot of money. They bought their house in the 1950s and she lived in it until we finally convinced her to go to the hospital and eventually Hospice. \n\nShe babysat me from the time I was 6 weeks old until I went to preschool, then picked me up from school until 7th grade when I could walk home. She was my everything. She was the rock that held us all together.\n\nMy mom and I cleaned out her house. We went through all her things and kept stuff, and also gave stuff away. In the end, my grandpa wrote us both a big check from her account for doing all that work and helping him so much through all of the pain of losing his mom. \n\nMy mom's cousins have been coming out of the woodwork, asking about her will and such. My poor grandpa has been bombarded with phone calls about it. They never came to visit her. They never called her. They never even knew or cared that she was dying. They never cared that she had dementia.\n\nYour grandparents gave you that money because they wanted you to have it. In my mind, if my mom's cousins gave a shit about their grandma, and visited her, she would have left them something.

They would be proud of that.

For the next family gathering, try to attend and be normal. You can see if people keep up with the silent treatment or not.\n\nIf people press you are argue with you, I would say the following:\n\n\"I am paying my debts and not touching the rest for a year until everyone is less burdened and influenced by grief. In the mean time, I would appreciate it if you would refrain from taking out any anger or resentments you have about you relationship with the grandparents out on me. They made the decision to distribute the money this way, not me. I am just as shocked as everyone else, but I deserve time and space to grieve too. I am not ready to talk finances at this time.\"\n\nI would just keep shutting them down that way for the rest of the year, or longer-- however much time you need to regain emotional balance and clarity. \n\n>$45,000 vs $2,000 is a huge difference.\n\nSometimes, wills are equitable. Sometimes they painfully play favorites. As the youngest, you are in the unfortunate circumstance of not even having been born while the foundational relationships between your grandparents and your cousins were being built, and how the relationships between the different parents impacted the relationships between grandparents and cousins.\n\nPrevious posters have gone against inequitable distributions in their parents wills because they thought the emotions and judgments that went into the distributions were unfair or cruel. Others feel very strongly that unequal distributions are fair punishment to siblings or other family members that acted poorly while the deceased were still living.\n\nRight now, you think you know where you stand. And there is nothing wrong with where you stand now and it may be where you stand in the future.

Your Grandparents did this for a reason and it was what they wanted.  \n\nLet me make one thing perfectly clear:  This is now your money.\n\nIf you are in a position that if you'd worked hard and saved up the same amount of money would you give a good chunk of it away as a gift to your cousins just because they asked?  This is really the same question.  Here is another similar question:  If your grandparents were alive and gave you that money and your cousins found out about it and demanded a portion of it would you give it to them even if your grandparents specifically told you they wanted you, and not them, to have it?  If your Grandmother paid off your college loan as a gift to you and it made your cousins jealous would you take out a new loan to give them the proceeds while you keep the debt?  You can see where I'm going with this.\n\nUnfortunately, the passing of assets after one's death (or even the contemplation of this before one's death) brings out the absolute worst greed in people.  People who have no right to the assets of the deceased suddenly feel that they are due more than the deceased loved one wanted them to have.\n\nIn the scope of life $45K is not a lot of money.  Splitting it up among a lot of cousins will dilute the value to everyone.  But at your age, as you indicated, the total amount your grandparents left you will make a huge difference.\n\nOver time your cousins and the rest of your family will get over this and if they don't then they are not the kind of people you need in your life in any event.

Two of them lived out of state and called/wrote every once in awhile, the other two lived close, one of which worked full-time and had more than enough on their plate to deal with.  That, I think, is somewhat exceptional, but even still, I think some people don't realize how limited their time is with people.\n\n...\n\nYou took an active role in your grandparent's life.  They noticed, appreciated and valued it and, as a result, now support you in *your* life.\n\nIf your cousins are giving you an ultimatum, that's unfortunate, but they should've valued their family more when they were here.  The fact that they're valuing the money more shows their true character.\n\nYou don't owe them anything and it's not your fault it's ending up like this.

What a bunch of assholes. I was in a similar situation although not such a large discrepancy from member to member. My parents divorced very early and I didn't have a father growing up. My grandfather was the only real dad I ever knew. I spent a lot of time with him growing up as my mom was always working. He had a house in the city, but also a farm in the country that I spent every summer working on. My grandfather passed away a bonafide millionare with many assets. I honestly never knew. He just seemed like an old farmer to me. He had 8 children all with their own kids. It was a a fucking blood bath when he died. My family ripped itself apart. Everyone showed their true colors. Before things reached a boiling point, I used my money to pay off loans and gave the rest to charity. I saw the land that we owned and that I spent growing up at each summer divided up and sold off. It was truly heartbreaking. I don't speak to much of my family anymore. The ones I do, have similar values to my own; money cant buy some things.",

Money and other issues like it aside, the common element that linked the families together- wanting to visit mom and dad- are gone. There is less motivation to put aside all your other activities for a family get-together.\n\nBut I digress: the money is yours. The grandparents may have helped the other members of the family in other ways- monetarily, as well- through the years and that IS a factor in what gets left. My uncles have money issues- guess who got a lot of their parents' money after they passed away? Not the part of the family that was self-sufficient, but the side of the family that needed the money. My folks got some of the sentimental stuff. I have my grandparents to thank in part for my attending grad school- they paid for some of my semesters. Never expected anything from them but they helped me there and I have no entitlement issues when it comes to them. Why should I? They're family.

During the process my 2nd cousin was arrested (she stole items from the estate) she served some jail time and had a pending court date. That was what motivated her and her father (my dads cousin) to settle and return most of the money, they traded that for them dropping the criminal charges against her.\n\nIf you were curious, we don't talk to them anymore.

Paying off your student loans, paying for your wedding, and becoming part of a down payment for your own home is probably exactly what your grandparents were wanting you to do. Your extended family sounds kind of shitty. 45k isn't even honestly that much money. Certainly not enough to get upset about. If you split it, they'd each get an extra ~3k (assuming 13 grandkids with 24k from their 2k each and 45k from you, divided by 13 is a little over 5k for each of you), not a huge difference and not enough to be life changing. Starting off your marriage and adult life debt free *is* life hanging and it's what your grandparents wanted for you.  I could understand feeling more obligated to share if you'd inherited millions and dividing it would actually be life changing for everybody, but your family is willing to cut you off over $3k a piece. That's how much they value your relationship. I could understand cutting you off if they needed $3k for lifesaving surgery and you had plenty of extra and they couldn't get it another way, but that's not what's happening here (and I'm guessing if it were you'd have paid the hospital bill already anyway). DO NOT SHARE. They will go right back to not valuing your relationship after they have the money and all you'll have done is ignored your grandparents final wishes and opted to start your adult life with debt for no real reason. I'd also bet that your cousins would reason that if they'd been left the money, they shouldn't share because they have families and house payments rather than keeping to their \"it should be shared\" idea. \n  \nMy family knows that my spouse and I are currently leaving all our assets to my baby brother because he's the baby and is just starting out and we don't have kids (our will will change if we ever get kids). My sister and her husband both have well paying jobs and own their home and have my nieces' college funds well planned out - they don't need our assets. My parents and grandparents all have enough. My brother is still in college, doesn't have a car, lives in the dorms. He's the only one who at this point would actually have a real need for our assets. Everyone else in the family supports that. And we all know that if another family member had a need, he would gladly step in and help.

The younger ones didn't get a chance to spend much time with our grandparents, and my 3 older cousins were not around a lot, so my grandparents didn't know them very well, either.  \n\nBe that as it may, my grandmother had planned on gifting me her car (1987 Chevy Nova) for my 16th birthday, so I had a free car. Incredibly generous and nice of her. When she knew she was dying, she wrote that into her will, because there are a lot of family members, and she didn't want it getting screwed up. My aunt was enraged that her daughter couldn't have the car. Her daughter (my cousin) had been kicked out of her boyfriend's house, was in a huge custody battle over their daughter (that she lost), and she couldn't make the payments on her car because she'd lost her job. Clearly she needed the car the most. My mom was fair about it, and gave me the option to give the car to my cousin, but the caveat was that I'd have to buy my own car, as my parents couldn't afford to help me with it. My aunt's reasoning was that I was still young, it was easier for me to save money for a car. It was all stupid.  \n\n\nThe bottom line is that you are not responsible for your grandparents' decisions. Your grandparents chose what to do with that money. End of story.   \n\n\nNew story: Your cousins want you to share $45,000 with them. Completely unrelated to what your grandparents wanted. How do you feel about that? Feel free to take them all out for an insane steak dinner, or something equally nice. But don't feel guilty or beholden to selfish people. You have a life to live. Do you want to pay off your future? Or continue working for that future?",
            "Respect your grandparents' wishes and keep the money for yourself.  Your cousins sound like people who come out of the woodwork once someone they know wins the lottery.  People that are willing to walk away from you over money that isn't theirs to begin with aren't worth keeping in your life.  ",
            "Don't split it. You are only accepting what your grandparents left to you. If your grandparents wanted your cousins to split it with you the will would have said so. Plus now that they went making such horrible threats, would you really want to associate with them regardless?",
            "**Get an attorney if they keep harassing you. Do NOT give them any money.**\n\nThere is clearly a reason that your grandparents left it to you and only you. My guess is that your cousins are irresponsible. If it causes riffs then so be it. I'm sure you wouldn't be acting like an entitled brat if it were the other way around. I can see being disappointed, but *demanding* you give them money? Nope. They seem like selfish assholes, so it's probably better off.",

If something happened to you while they were still alive (car repairs, hospital bill, expensive textbook, etc) they could have helped you out and provided that financial safety net for you. they knew that once they passed, their estate would be divided up among their children and that safety net of money would dry up immediately. By giving you this large sum of money, they're giving you that security against future problems/unexpected bills, as well as the ability to get a fantastic head start on saving for bigger things like buying your first home. Honor their memory and their intentions by keeping this money and using it wisely. \n\nSee a financial advisor about the best way to save it and use it for your future. Don't engage with your relatives, don't give in to their pressure to hand over your inheritance to their lazy children.

If they want to be mad at someone, they can be mad at the grandparents, because it's not your fault. They will stew and be angry, but that's their greed, not yours.\n\nI deal with wills and inheritance every day, and people really turn on one another for the tiniest amounts. A couple hundred dollars can drive sedges in families, a large chunk like this makes it inevitable. Just ask yourself, if you did split it, would they change?

Situations like this are exactly why people include clauses in their wills that make it clear their intentions to leave anyone out were not on accident. \n\nYour hard work over the years, and love shown to them throughout your life, did not go unnoticed and meant a lot to them.

What's ironic is that in situations like this people seem to forget that the assets only exist because someone died. \n\nI'm sad for you that you are faced with this dilemma when you should be taking time to grieve the death of your grandparents.

If you want to talk sense into them I'd say talk to some of them individually and try to reason with them. Tell them how they are putting money over family by putting you in this position. And if they tell you that you're doing that by not giving it to them, ask them if you did give it to the would that actually negate the fact that they made the threat in the first place? Does it change the fact that they want her to not honor the wishes of their family (grandparents)? Ask them would you ever trust anyone that threatened them for money? Would they trust someone that puts money over family enough to make threats to their own family? If that doesn't change their minds at all, you know their true colors.

I was the only grandchild who worked with her doing food prep when we would all go camping together.  She wanted to give me her convection stove that she bought about 6 or 7 years before she died, and she wanted my mom to get her motor-home so my mom could go camping since we were way behind financially compared to my mom's sisters because we had to weather seven years of unemployment during my childhood.\n\nMy mom's sisters were total bitches about it.  They forced my mom to account for the value of the motorhome and the stove against her share of everything else.  Despite the fact that two of them have vacation homes and the other doesn't like camping and doesn't needs a vacation home since she lives in Florida.  All so the other three could split a few thousand dollars.  The motor-home was a 1984 model with a shitload of miles and worth peanuts, and the stove was a mid-grade model and maybe worth 1k when brand new, which meant that it had depreciated quite a bit already.\n\nI have seen only one of my aunts in the decade or so that has past since my grandma's death...they were so petty about my grandma's estate that they threw away their relationship with their sister and her kids for some money.\n\nIf your cousins are willing to shut you out over a few thousands dollars that were given specifically to you...then let them.\n\nThey aren't worth your time or energy.",

            "Your cousins are terrible for putting this sort of pressure on you, as well as greedy and selfish. ",
            "I am sorry for your loss.\n\nIt sounds like you had a beautiful relationship with your grandparents. Your grandparents decided to give you more due to the \"work\" that you put into the relationship.. you unselfishness... kindness and love...\n\nYou never asked for anything when they were alive, and if my sense is right if they tried to give you anything you declined it. So they are giving it to you now when you cannot give it back.\n\nI feel like you should be angry and show it. It doesn't have to be flip all the tables angry but anger that family has decided to, instead of grieving the loss and celebrating and reminiscing about all of the good have instead decided to be one of \"those\" families who fight over $$. And ask them, why do they think this happened.. and when they say you planned it, ask them why they said that. Let them figure it out or dig their own holes..\n\nThese cousins, etc are either really ugly inside or feeling guilty and trying to deflect it by putting it on you. That in and of itself is ugly.\n\nDo not reward this ugliness.. your grandparents did not.\n\nAlso, if you do give them the money, it won't solve anything. If they think these things of you for whatever reason, the relationship is already ruined.. you cannot pay them off and that is how they will treat it. They are showing their true colors.\n\nI am sorry that it is such a mess right now... I suspect though, that by the lack of support that they had shown your family in the past that you already knew that they do not feel the same way about you, your grandparents and anyone outside of themselves as you do.\n\nSpend your love and time cultivating relationships that are dual sided.",
            "I just think it's weird that your grandparents would ask you to work at their bar and not pay you since money apparently wasn't an issue for them.\n\nBut yeah, keep the money!",
            "Absolutely keep every penny.  Your cousins sounds like low-lifes.  This shouldn't even be a thing.",
            "Keep the money. If they weren't acting like this, then that'd be one thing, one indicator that you should maybe think about sharing.\n\nBut holy crap they are acting like brats. Don't give them a penny. If your grandparent wanted to leave them all an even amount, then he would have done so.\n\nBut he didn't. He left it for you, and you alone. Honor his wishes.",
            "You put in the time to get to know your grandparents, you spent time with them and built a really great relationship from what I see.  I say keep the money.  If they care more about the money than they care about you, well, fuck 'em.  You don't need a conditional relationship with your family.  You're the one who developed a strong and loving relationship with your grandparents, and they are showing you their appreciation now that they're gone.  Keep the money.",
            "Are these cousins of yours capable of seeing reason on this?? Jesus.  They're just consumed by jealousy and not seeing reason.  I'm just trying to think of myself in this situation.  I really honestly would respect the grandparents' wishes regarding the distribution of money that THEY earned.  It's their fucking choice where it goes.  You didn't decide where they wanted the money to go.  Tell your cousins to get angry at the grandparents if it makes them feel any better.  Inconsiderate shits.\n\nShit happens, they didn't get as big a cut, but then they weren't as big a part of their life as you were.  End of story.",
            "Listen to everyone who loves you. Your fiance and your parents have the right of it. You grandparents had the right of it as they allocated that money to you as well. It goes to you. Pay off your loans, put 20k away for your wedding, put the rest towards the things you love. They bar, the horses, or as a downpayment for a house. \n\nIt's what your grandparents want.",
            "I will pose a single question to you:\n\nYou say if you keep all the money, you risk losing your family.  If this is how they act towards you, though, do you really WANT to keep them?",
            " I'm in a similar situation. I've always been there for my Great Grandmother and my Great Uncle. I was always there hanging out and I would always run errands for them. After my Uncle died, I stopped by and cooked and cleaned for my Nan and got her groceries and stopped by for visits frequently, and I'm the only relative to ever do so. So my Nan left me her house in her will, and her middle son Leon (My late Uncles older brother) believes that he deserves it because hes her son, even though my Nan hasn't seen him since my Uncles funeral two years ago.\n\n They aren't entitled to the money. You did all the work, you loved them and were there for them when noone else was, therefore you deserve the money.",
            "absolutely do NOT give them any money. Please, don't enable them to do shitty things like this. This is your money, your grandparents gave it to YOU.",
            "I can't believe these people are fighting over  years salary. Unbelievable. Keep the cash ",
            "Lets put it into a different perspective.\n\nBefore your grandparents passed, they decided that you deserved to have a larger inheritance because they felt you, of all your cousins, deserved it. If you so choose, you can disagree with their wishes and distribute it to your cousins if you want, but that would go against the spirit of your grandparents decision.\n\nNow imagine, hypothetically, if your employer gave you a large end of year bonus of 45,000 and your coworkers only got 2000 each. Imagine if they demanded you split your bonus with them because they also worked for the same company. Imagine if they told you that if you refused to split that money that they would shun you. Is that fair? Or are they being greedy?",
            "Why would you want to keep people in your life like that? \n\nI think you are witnessing the reason they didn't get much of an inheritance. The very fact that you are guilty about it shows why you received it.\n\nPlease listen to your SO.",
            "Youre not losing them, they are losing you with their demands. Anytime anybody, ever, in your life, says \"If you want my love do X\" you walk the fuck away right there. They dont love you. They see you as a cash register. ",
            "> Is it right for me to keep this much?\n\nYour grandparents certainly thought so.  How would they feel if they could see how your cousins are acting?",
            "Keep the money. That's what your grandparents wanted. If your cousins, aunts, and uncles bitch about it, say this to them:\n\n\n\"I think that grandma and grandpa partially intended my larger sum of money to be a payment-back for the thousands of hours I worked **free** for them on their horse farm and at their bar. I suppose [other cousins] got less because they helped grandparents out for less hours. I feel really sad that you'd want to exclude me from the family just because GPs chose to leave me more money -- I thought we all loved each other more than that kind of jealousy.\"\n\n\nThat's the simplest way to convey to them what you, your parents, and your girlfriend already know: you deserve this money more. If they still bitch, get your parents to ask aunts + uncles why they aren't giving your cousins more of their cash sums, considering the parents probably received other valuable assets too (houses, businesses, cars).",
            "Tell them you will respect your grandma's last wishes and will make good use of the money. Keep it then.",
            "Your grandmother willed the money to YOU, not them.  These were her wishes.  If she wanted them to have it, she would have made it so.\n\nDo what's best for you.  But I vote that you keep the money.",
            "dont respond. change numbers. problem solved\n",
            "I just don't understand some people. When my grandmother died she left her money equally to her 2 children (70's) and they both independently decided to split it with their children (me and my cousins).\n\nMy aunt only has 2 kids and my dad has 4. That meant that me and my siblings received a 1/4 of what my cousins did.\n\nDo I care? NO! Do I love my cousins? YES\n\nMy grandmother was a wonderful woman and I still miss her.\n\nI guess I'm trying to say that your cousins have made this an issue and unfortunately they will possibly break up the family. You haven't done anything.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like your grandma was the glue holding them all together anyway.\n\nHold onto your money for your family. I'm 100% sure that's what your grandma would have wanted."

Us.\n\nAfter reading everyone's advice, I convinced my husband to go get a testosterone test.  It came back normal.  We are in the same postion, only it is so much worse, so much lonlier, and I am in counseling so I can start feeling ready to leave.\n\n\n1. I got some toys to have better sex. Now that's all he wants to do is use those on me.  It honestly is just like him helping me masturbate, which I do just fine.\n\n\n2. He wants me to just tell him when I am ready, like - hey, I want to have sex. And then he uses the toys on me. It feels sort of degrading to me, like - if you have an itch, tell me and I'll scratch it.  \n\n\n3.  He never went to see a specialist.  I have asked many times, what if it is because of something simple, maybe a specialist could find out? But no, he said it isn't worth the money.  And that feels like he is saying I am not worth the $30 copay.\n\n\n4.  I am sad that I stayed married.  I feel sexually lonely. I never feel attractive or beautiful. \n\n\n5. We love each other, and in that way have a happy relationship.But it is like a long distance relationship in the same house.\n\n\n--\nUPDATE:\n\nI have shared much of this discussion with him, thank you.  \n\nAs for the part about me not feeling beautiful, hew said we are both getting older. That conversation made me feel sadder than I already feel.\n\nAs for the question of attraction in general, he said there are women he finds attractive, but not to the point of having a crush or flirting.\n\nAs for going to a doctor and looking into other options, he laughed and said, \"my body, my choice.\"\n--\n**tl;dr**: Still no sex, still sad, but now considering leaving. I wish my 20 year old self would have had the confidence to admit sex mattered and to run away from a partner who didn't want to learn why he had ED.",

I thought our therapist was good, we have had two couples therapists and i have had 3 or 4 individual therapists.\n\nBut at the end of the day he is an adult who is making a choice.  He doesn\u2019t follow the advice.  One therapist said - first, don\u2019t have sex at all this week.  Just hold each other. And that was about his interest level.",
            "Maybe I\u2019m reaching, but if he\u2019s had ED for 20+ years, meds are no longer helping, and he refuses to see a specialist there\u2019s something much deeper going on. Has he given up? Low self-esteem?  \nIf you\u2019re unable to revise your idea of sex and he doesn\u2019t want to change, divorce might be best.",
            "Firstly I'm sorry you're going through this.  \n\n\n> He never went to see a specialist. I have asked many times, what if it is because of something simple, maybe a specialist could find out? But no, he said it isn't worth the money. And that feels like he is saying I am not worth the $30 copay. \n\nHave you told him this? Have you directly told him that you're considering divorce because you feel so disconnected in respect to sex and how he's responding to your needs there? \n\nIt sounds like clear, honest communication is part of the issue here. He doesn't understand how important sex is to you, or that his lack of interest in fixing his ED issue is making you feel unloved, lonely and unsatisfied.\n\nAre you two in couples therapy? Have you considered a sex therapist who might help you both to find a relationship with sex between you? I feel like a sex therapist could help both of you, him to understand how critical sex is to you beyond just you having an orgasm, and you in seeing sex as more than just piv. Does he really understand how critical sexual intimacy WITH him is to you and what the lack of it is leaving you with?\n\nBut if you're 100% done, that is OK too. You're needs sexually are completely valid, if you feel you need to stay in therapy to get yourself ready to leave, then you do that. You don't HAVE to do any more work when he's expressing such lack of urgency about it.",

When you've told him all this, hopefully he'll listen and take action. But if he doesn't, you should consider leaving.

            "This.....is depressing. Reading your OP, then clicking back on here and reading the 'im not worth the $30 copay' broke me. If my SO said that, after years of the same issue, I'd cry and leave asap. \n\nPlease find the strength to leave. You deserve love and affection.",
            "OP, something could be seriously, physically wrong with your husband. I work in a multi-specialty medical practice, and all of them would be able to identify this issue. The issue is not your husband's dick. His dick is a symptom of something that may be much more serious going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan he obtain an erection when masturbating? Does he get morning wood? If the answer to both of those is no, your husband needs to go to a specialist for HIS OWN HEALTH, as well as your sexual relationship with him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few things that could be causing his problem include uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled blood pressure, a slow growing prostate cancer, high estrogen or progesterone (since you know his testosterone is normal), unbalanced thyroid hormones. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGo with him to a specialist if at all possible. Not only for your sex life, but for his health and well being. Hopefully your sex life can recover if the psychological and clinical issues are addressed.",

            "So my husband also had some problems and he is much younger.  I had to ball my eyes out to convince him to go get checked.  In our case it was low testosterone.\n\nThere are few other physical causes that your husband should rule out since viagra isn\u2019t working.  He needs his heart checked and for diabetes.  Circulation issues can affect the penis and he probably should get the blood flow in his penis checked.  Diabetes causes nerve damage and penises are not exempt.\n\nIf you want one last ditch effort make the appointment at the urologist for him and go with him.  If he\u2019s like my husband he blows it off as oh I\u2019m just tired today... or this isn\u2019t my normal.\n\nMy husbands first test came back low with lots of excuses and the second test came back lower so he finally quit with the excuses.\n\nI think it\u2019s a really difficult issue for a man to face.  \n\nIf he refuses to go to the appointment that you make, then you have done everything you can.  Maybe give one last explanation that a toy is not as fun as a real penis and you really just want to have sex.",
            "I (38F) was married to someone (40M) with ED that he did not want to address and told numerous lies about (\"I don't know why, it's never been a problem\") until all of a sudden he didn't (while at urologist's office: \"it's always been a problem). It was hard to leave, and ultimately there were many more reasons, but he made me feel selfish and unreasonable for wanting to feel desired by my partner, to have a way to connect through physical intimacy, and to also feel like I could please the person I married in bed. \n\nFeel free do DM me if you'd like to compare notes. My marriage only lasted about 5 years, so I know the decision didn't have the same weight as it might for you after a couple decades. But if I learned one thing through that ordeal, and through connecting with a lot of thoughtful kind people on Reddit, it's that whenever someone says they have a great and loving relationship aside from sex, they're usually deluding themselves. \n\nA partner's disinterest in ensuring your needs are met in one area of your relationship and life is rarely isolated to just the bedroom, or just washing the dishes, or just money. When a partner is not committed to taking care of you as well as they would take care of themselves, it will show up in ways big and small throughout your relationship. Unfortunately, for a lot of us, we only recognize that in hindsight.",
            "OP, first off, I am deeply sorry you\u2019re having to go through this. But I also want to say thank you...\n\nSeveral years ago, I finally met the most amazing man. We were amazing together, he was so genuine and thoughtful. We transitioned into a long distance relationship maybe 6 months in when he moved to go to grad school. We didn\u2019t have sex much during that time because 1. We lived so far away, and 2. He started antidepressants and was very stressed out because of school. The longest we went was 6 months. His problem was getting and keeping an erection... Once he graduated I moved to be with him, and the issue became even more apparent. He\u2019d rarely initiate sex (he was off antidepressants by then), and when I tried to get him in the mood he\u2019d be so anxious to get it in me as soon as his erection appeared I was in no way \u201cready\u201d for sex... so the fumbling to get it in my dry vagina was enough to make him lose his erection. I was very supportive, tried to talk to him about it, but he wouldn\u2019t go to a specialist either. He never tried to do anything to support my needs... never wanted to try oral, hand stuff, or toys. So it was literally up to me to fulfill my needs. I was already mentally spiraling due to other issues in my life, but this situation made it so much worse. We lived together for a year, and eventually I slipped up and was sexting with a guy I knew from across the country. He found out, saw my texts. We didn\u2019t work out. He saw a specialist while we were on a break while he decided what he wanted to do. \n\nI haven\u2019t been able to forgive myself and it\u2019s been over three years since this happened. I carry so much guilt because I feel like I gave up one of the best things that ever happened to me. My last relationship lasted 1.5 years and was full of amazing, kinky sex. But he broke up with me a year ago in May and I later discovered he was cheating on me and left me for a girl he worked with. For the past year i have felt so hurt, every single day, for what he did. But also I feel like it\u2019s absolutely what I deserved for being unfaithful myself. \n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to get at... is that even if I didn\u2019t do the things that I did... I still would be unhappy down the road. I\u2019m not trying to make light of your situation. I guess I just wanted to say... I see your pain and I feel your pain. Please do what is right for you. He has an option to go to a specialist but he\u2019s not. He\u2019s choosing him over you, which means you have every right to choose yourself. Take care and *hugs*.",
            "What did they say was normal? As far as his testosterone levels.\n\nMost of the time they say anything above 200 is normal but that's not gonna get his dick up",
            "I understand this is a very frustrating situation for you. You have this big chunk of your life that is missing and a husband, the one who is supposed to help you take care of that chunk walking around like there is no issue and everything is fine. It has to be enraging to have this giant issue with seemingly no recourse. \n\nI see a lot of people approaching you with the topic of your husband being Asexual and you ignoring them, but I need you to understand there is a GIANT possibility that there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG with EITHER OF YOU! \n\nYou are not unattractive, or undesirable, or anything else you anxiety has maybe made you think over the course of your marriage with a dead bedroom. And he does not have ED, low testosterone, or is not attracted to you. He could absolutely be Asexual. \n\nAsexual- a person with little or no sexual desire.\n\nSo while he absolutely loves you and thinks your wonderful-sex is not something that is ever in ANY equation for him. He probably never thinks about it unless you bring it up and then he does what he can to make you happy, because it makes YOU HAPPY! I cant speak if he hates it or not because I'm not him, but you haven't said he complains so, I think hes good.\n\nI have a feeling he knows ALL THIS about himself and that's why he refuses to \"talk to someone\" or \" see someone\" because there is literally nothing they can do.

            "Your husband is either asexual or just not attracted to you. \n\nThat\u2019s not ED. ED isn\u2019t 20 years long with no desire to get medical help and a weird willingness to get involved in sex play but not really participate. \n\nHe\u2019s treating your libido like giving you an oil change because these aren\u2019t feelings he feels. \n\nHe\u2019s probably honestly unable to understand your problem.",
            "I\u2019m almost asexual, and this sounds like my last relationship as my bf had an insanely high sex drive (or it was to me, might be normal to everyone else), it was the biggest incompatibility and part of the reason it ended. \nHe would tell me he didn\u2019t feel attractive because I rarely initiated, and I was more than willing to help him any time he wanted but that wasn\u2019t enough. If he is asexual, it\u2019s hard to change that and be better/more suited to your needs, as you just never (or very rarely) feel like having sex,so lack of it doesn\u2019t seem like an issue that needs to be solved. Personally that never crossed my mind until my ex said he had an issue with it, but I wasn\u2019t sure how to even fix it, can\u2019t force feeling something I don\u2019t.",
            "There are five possibilities, in order from most likely to least likely:\n\n1. He\u2019s asexual or gay. Probably asexual if he doesn\u2019t masturbate.\n\n2. He\u2019s just not attracted to you, but adores you and so he feels bad he\u2019s not attracted. Therefore he knows nothing is wrong with him so no doctor would help. \n\n3. He is suffering from a mental illness such as severe anxiety or depression. Both these illnesses and the medications used to treat them often destroy libido. \n\n4. He has a medical issue that can or cannot be resolved. \n\n5. He\u2019s cheating. \n\nBut in my view, if its been going on for 22 years, 3 and 5 are unlikely. \nI know of many cases where a guy marries a girl he\u2019s not attracted to because he feels he should be and will be because she\u2019s so conventionally beautiful and sought after. Or that she\u2019s perfect wife material. Or maybe because his parents like her a lot? \n\nDoes he look at porn? Do you ever catch him staring at you when you\u2019re wearing a nice outfit? Does he flirt? These answers can help direct you towards a possible problem or solution.",
            "I am in the same situation. Thank you for being out there with this.  It\u2019s difficult as the woman to be asking for sex, or just giving up my sexuality. \nI feel there is such a double standard-that if I were a man, my partner would be told to try to be more active, more attractive, more open to the partner\u2019s needs. \nIt is lonely. I don\u2019t really want to just \u2018get off\u2019 (which is what I do by myself). It\u2019s about playing and being connected and passion.",

I think there's a generic to make it not so pricey, but he might respond better to that if Viagra isn't working. Maybe you're not even interested in trying it at this point - I don't blame you.",
            "Have you considered your husband might be asexual? Just a possibility. I don\u2019t know much about it but I heard they don\u2019t really have a sex drive or feel sexual arousal in situations where someone would normally. If he thinks a $30 copay isn\u2019t worth trying to improve your sex life and making you happy, maybe he just isn\u2019t bothered with having sex at all?",
            "I did not read through comments on your first post so this might have been suggested, but many men lose the ability to obtain erections without pornography. Is it possible your husband uses pornography regularly? If so, abstaining from pornography might bring the erections back. \n\nSorry, OP. I would leave too, especially since he isn\u2019t treating it seriously or expressing much concern. His lack of concern may suggest he is asexual or getting his rocks off via masturbation. In any case, a critical part of romantic life is missing from your relationship and I wish you luck in finding a more fulfilling one (no pun intended).",

Is he complementing you?  Do you overall have a loving connection and the issue is  he cannot show love/attraction that matters to you because PiV is off the table?\n\nHave you confirmed he's not masturbating, ever?  \n\nIt sounds like you are the one creating distance because you have a need for PiV -- which I fully respect and understand you have every right to want the sexual connection you want! -- and that's creating the distance?\n\nYou got toys and he's eager to have you experience sexual pleasure and ... you are unhappy about this.  \n\n22 years is a really long time, if you haven't found joy in all the other parts of your relationship then he, as well as you, would probably benefit from ending the marriage.",

Honestly I feel he is trying with the toys, but he may be ashamed and not like to face/admit his condition. \n\nI would sit down and have him do all the talking. You need his honest perspective. He is probably extremely insecure, so approach it with sympathy. Is he content with his current life, or not? How does he feel about lack of sex, or does he? Does he still masturbate or feel the need to? What difference has he recognized in himself over time? Why does he refuse to get help for such a common issue? \n\nYou love him obviously, so if you want to stay then consider an ultimatum. Most importantly you need honesty here, and then you can move forward.",

            "There are so many replies and I'm not sure if his has been discussed, but when you get a Testosterone test and they tell you it's \"normal\" they're technically being truthful, but not telling you the full story. Testosterone is measured on a range from pubescent boy to seventy-year-old man and anything on that spectrum is \"normal.\" But it's not normal for a man in his forties to have no interest in sex, which suggests his T level is in the normal human range, but isn't normal for a man his age.\n\nLack of testosterone doesn't just impact a man's sex life, it affects a man's brain. Making no effort to deal with things, having no energy, having no interest in finding solutions are also part of having low testosterone. Find the number results from his test and look them up online to see what they mean and if they're actually normal for his age. You want normal for your husband, what's normal for every male from twelve to death is meaningless.\n\nIf it is low T, you're going to have to push your husband into dealing with it, his low T will prevent him from dealing with it on his own.\n\nWhen I began to suspect there was a problem it took me a while to deal with it, but I did eventually and I had to argue with my doctor. He said don't worry about it, but I pestered him and he sent me to a urologist. I had done some reading beforehand so when the urologist told me it was \"normal\" I told him it wasn't normal for me, something had changed.\n\nWe discussed my medical history and I'd had to get surgery some years ago and because of how blood vessels are arranged an unmentioned side effect is that some men have their testosterone reduced. That wasn't mentioned to me, and there was no reason for me to think they was related. The urologist was willing to accept that as a medical reason and sent me to the TRT doctor in his office. I still spent a couple years before forcing myself to make a appointment for shots.\n\nEven if it's not a specific thing causing low T, it's just age, genetics, or whatever, if your husband's level is low, it's up to you to force him to get it fixed, he *can't* do it on his own, and be prepared to have to find a doctor who takes it seriously. Viagra works if you want to have sex, it doesn't work if you're not interested. It reacts to the physical changes during sexual arousal, it doesn't cause arousal itself, that's testosterone's job.",

I agree with other comments that his behavior is not ED, but just who he is sexually.\n\n**Two years ago,** you had a deficit mindset: That your husband's sexuality was something \"not enough\" about him.\n\n>  our sex life was not like what my friends described in terms of quickies\n\nYou defined your sex as less-than based on what your friends are doing.\n\n> I just want to have normal, easy sex\n\n> he never was able to complete the act\n\nYou defined sex narrowly; it has to be \"normal\" and \"easy\" for you, and it only counts when it leads to an orgasm from him. \n\n> Viagra worked wonders, for years\n\nYou believed that sex with him could only be a \"wonder\" when it was diagnosed and medicated; again, his sexuality is an illness, something wrong.\n\n**Two later, now,** you *still* have a deficit mindset.\n\n> Guess which couple hasn't been having sex during the quarentine? Us\n\nYou still place value on your intimacy based on what other couples are doing during the quarantine, now with a healthy dose of contempt. \n\n> I got some toys to have better sex. Now that's all he wants to do is use those on me. It honestly is just like him helping me masturbate, which I do just fine.\n\nYou still narrowly define sex. Despite your husband's willingness to try something new, you view his attempts to be intimate with your as \"not enough\" because they don't count as sex in your book.\n\n> After reading everyone's advice, I convinced my husband to go get a testosterone test. It came back normal.\n\nYou continue to attempt to diagnose your husband's sexuality or spin it as a health problem, even though every test seems to indicate he's healthy. \n\nIf P in V, man-initiates-and-reads-your-mind, toyless, rigid, man-cums-every-time, we-have-as-much-if-not-more-sex-than-all-my-friends sex exactly when you want it, without-paying-money, no-therapy sex is really what you value and need, that's valid. Anyone is entitled to define what they need in a relationship.\n\nBut I think it's also worth considering that it's valid, too, for your husband to want to be himself, ED and all, and to have a relationship where he is enough for his partner--where he is not termed sick or callous or a \"floppy fellow\" again and again for something it seems he can't change about himself.\n\nIf you're unhappy, I'm sure he's unhappy, too, knowing you can't really love him because of this thing he can't give you. That every time you suggest a supplement or send him to the doctor, you're telling him, \"I'd love you if only...\" except the love never arrives. \n\nIf you can't love him enough to love all of him, it's best to end it.

I was with my ex for 7 years, and the grief over the loss of the relationship/friendship has been difficult- things might be rough for you at first, especially since you were together 22 years (!!), but remember why you made this decision. I wish you the absolute best in your journey ahead!",
            "Babe. Either ask for an open relationship (harsh on him and maybe marriage breaking). Get yourself a divorce and go have sex with whomever and whatever you want (might seem selfish, to get a divorce over sex LOL) or accept your situation and leave the sex life in the closet.",

Either way, it's a fundamental incompatibility and you should probably break up. Sorry and good luck Op.",
            "Saying you are ready to leave because you can\u2019t have sex and he doesn\u2019t care about it enough doesn\u2019t seem reasonable to me.

            "I'm sorry that you feel like he doesn't want you.\n\nThe thing is, if he actually has erectile dysfunction, you should accept it. It sounds like he has accepted that he's \"broken\", thus not seeking treatment. IF this is the case, you should talk to him about wanting to be physical - be it that you get a friend-with-benefits type of situation, going to a male prostitute (I think they're called a gigolo). If he doesn't want to compromise, then you- sadly - might have to make an ultimatum; that either he gets treatment finds it in himself to \"want you\" OR you will find someone who actually wants you (aka leaving him). If he's asexual, closeted-gay or something to that extend he should disclose it to you.",
            "I'm so sorry you're going through this. I'm not gonna tell you what to do, just keep in mind that leaving a marriage that makes you feel this sad, with the root of it being a lack of sex life and lack of interest from your partner to make things better , is a very good reason to leave.",

I do not blame you one bit for making an exit plan. In fact, I would encourage it at this point. \n\nYou\u2019re in a deep and close friendship, not a fulfilling partnership.

He might, despite everything, still not understand how this makes you feel. \n\nSorry if this is more of the same, I really feel for you.

It\u2019s due to a lot of different things. His medication, he had a back injury that hurt the nerves in his lower back 13 years ago, pain medication, and being 57 doesn\u2019t help either.

            "Honestly I find this very sad. I feel like this is such a complicated yet simple issue. I think a big portion of people saying he is content is probably accurate. Something you need to look at though is why you\u2019re now wanting to leave just because of sex. 22 years later you\u2019re gonna move one so you can get your rocks off? I get a lot of people will say it\u2019s so much more than that. But reality is I think you\u2019re hitting a mid life right now. You\u2019re already past the more active sexual years of your life but now you can\u2019t go without it? Perhaps you feel like you only have so much more time left to even have sex and that\u2019s your concern. But honestly you\u2019ll regret throwing your life away for this. You have someone who takes care of you and loves you. Like everyone else there\u2019s some kinks but you\u2019ve dealt with it this long. It\u2019s really not worth ending up sad and lonely or with someone you don\u2019t truly love. I\u2019m sure you would like to reach the end of your life with someone who truly loves you, someone who looks at you and says you\u2019re my whole life, I can\u2019t go on without you. Not some person who just satisfied your carnal desires. Therapy is preparing you to leave? Sounds like crappy therapy. Doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s what\u2019s best for you but what\u2019s best to keep you coming back for a long while. But it\u2019s your life and I\u2019m just an internet stranger so best of luck.",
            "Does he want the issue fixed? That's the biggest thing. If the patient does not want to correct the problem, there is no way you can force it.\n\nBelow is what I wrote to a different contributor on this thread.\n\n.....\n\nLook at pelvic floor physical therapy. It improves blood flow and nerve function. Helped me a lot. Barral Institute in Florida has listings of therapists. It's a good school.\n\nAnother thing would be a good acupuncturist. They work the body in a comprehensive way.\n\nThere's a chance of child abuse which you may have pushed out of consciousness. That has to be resolved with a psychotherapist and it can be elicited through hypnotherapy.\n\nPast life regression is another treatment modality for complex issues. Some kind of trauma in a past life may cause issues in this one. Weiss is a hypnotherapist in Florida who had written books on this subject and has done it for decades.\n\nGood luck!",
