So here's an update:\n\nAfter I wrote the original post, my mom took my son to stay overnight with my wife's sister so that the two of us could have the house to ourselves.\n\nWe pretty much just talked for an hour while constantly reaffirming that we love each other a lot and want to sort this out. I apologized and explained why I did what I did. She said that feeling like she was there for our son's milestones was really just a band-aid solution that didn't actually convince her she was present. She said that if she actually *had* been using the milestones to feel like she was present, this would probably have felt worse for her. But since she wasn't, in her words, \"deluding herself into thinking she's actually home\", her main issue was that I lied which hurt her feelings. I apologized and explained that I honestly thought that she would prefer the lying if given the choice. She said she understood where I was coming from and that she felt betrayed when she realized, but she sees that I was doing it because I love her and she thinks we'll probably laugh about it with our grandkids one day (yes, I am very aware I don't deserve my wife).\n\nSome things came out on my end that I wasn't going to tell her and didn't mention in my last post- namely, that I'm scared she's going to become suicidal. My uncle committed suicide when I was a child, in part from working in a high-stress job where he made a huge and costly mistake. One of my wife's colleagues attempted suicide while she was on mat leave. Being a working mom is bad enough, being a resident in this program is bad enough, both combined are a recipe for trouble. Since our son was born and the incident with her colleague happened, I've been afraid that if her home life wasn't perfect, it would push her over the edge. Anyways, she reassured me that that's not happening and I think saying it out loud also made me realize it's a pretty irrational, groundless fear.\n\nWe ordered takeout and sat together watching the real videos I have of all our son's firsts. I also have a special folder of pictures/videos of my son with my wife, so we went through that after. She almost choked from laughing so hard when I tentatively revealed the beanbag trick. I am the laughing stock of her friend-group chat. So I guess we're already at the stage where we're laughing about it.\n\nThank you to those who responded to the last post! The stereotype of *someone* in [r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships) advocating divorce every time anything happens is true.\n\ntl;dr: marriage is work. I am stupid. We moved past it.",

            "So I don't have any advice, but I am one of three children born to a Family Med physician mom. My mom had my older sister during med school, me during residency, and my younger sister a year into her practice. My dad worked part time and his mom was our \"daycare provider\" our whole lives (grandma still babysits the puppies for my parents).\n\nI'm sure my mom missed a ton of milestones, but you know what? None of us kids know that she missed them. My mom would come home and love on us.  She'd come home for lunch after my younger sister was born, and I remember eating yogurt with her on the floor. I remember helping her dig the car out of the snowbank at the end of the driveway after she got home from working Urgent Care late into the evening. \n\nMy dad and I are really close, and I'm sure that has something to do with him being around more when I was a baby, but I'm also really close with my mom. I learned women can do whatever they want to do AND  have a family. I learned that kids don't have to be the absolute center of your world to be happy and healthy. \n\nI hope your wife doesn't put too much pressure on herself about missing these things. Your kid won't know the difference and will love you and your wife no matter what.",

            "You sound like the kind of husband I'd hope to have one day. Your wife is a lucky lady. Best of luck to her as she finishes her residency. I will most likely be in her shoes one day (a working mom): she isn't any \"less\" because she's working to provide a good future for her child. She will miss some things, yes ... but she's going to make a whole lot possible, too. YOU GUYS GOT THIS.",
            "My husband just finished residency last summer, so I get this on a whole other level. I think what you did was incredibly sweet and thoughtful. I\u2019m glad everything has worked out in the end and remember, this will be over soon! Post-residency life is still tough on the days my husband is at the hospital (long hours) but then he\u2019s off and when he\u2019s off, he\u2019s OFF! We can go out of town and have done several mini vacations during his off weeks. Hotels are much cheaper on a Tuesday, after all! He loves being able to bond and connect for long stretches of time. It does always take a day or two for our toddler to warm up to him so keep that in mind. He\u2019ll just want \u201cmama\u201d for awhile but eventually he warms up to daddy and is super happy being around him. Sometimes he cries when it\u2019s time for my husband to go back to work. Anyway, good luck and hang in there! The most important asset in residency is a supportive partner and it sounds like your wife has just that :)",
            "No lie, I teared up reading this because you guys seem to have the best relationship and your wife seems like such a chill, stable lady.  Im so happy for you two. ",
            "I wasnt there for your last post, but this gave me the warm and fuzzies (is that the right term?). \n\nThank you for sharing. As I was reading your first post, I suspected she was crying so much over the well intentioned white lies. I'm glad you two were able to talk it out, openly, come to an understanding and move on.\n\nThis is how it's supposed to be, this is how it's supposed to happen! \n\nThanks for giving me a little hope. You two sound like a lovely couple.",

            "Just my 2c, i know your hard working wife probably feels guilty not being present for all these moments, but in reality, as a parent myself, as long as your child is well loved, their needs taken care of,\n it's not the firsts that eventually matter, but how your child ends up as an adult responding to the world around them, life & it's challenges, your wife is sacrificing much to create a future for you all, these heavy shifts will smooth out & her time will become more balanced, healthy kids take these things in their stride so don't sweat the small stuff, you have each other & your health, enjoy your good fortune & be happy, good luck little family...",
            "As a working mom to a kiddo the same age, I so feel your wife's pain in this. I'm an RN, so if I'm on a long stretch of shifts I also will spend days without seeing our baby awake. It is so incredibly difficult to be away from your baby for those long hours. I love my career, but many days I wonder why I do it. But as much as I don't ever want to miss a thing, it also means a lot to me that my husband gets to experience the joy of those first. I take a lot of comfort in that. I bet your wife also is very comforter be the knowledge that your baby is being cared for by such a loving dad. I'm so glad you two were able to talk it out and laugh about it. You sound like a great parenting team. Keep up the good work, both of you.",
            "I'm glad it worked out. FYI, daycares do the same thing to spare the mothers the guilt of missing firsts. ( I was instructed to lie about baby's firsts when I worked at one.) At least daddy and grandma were there witnessing it and not some stranger. ",
            "I hope your wife realizes what an incredible role model she is to your son. Residency is brutal and missing out is so hard but he is going to grow up to be a wonderful partner being shown that gender roles don\u2019t have to be followed and that his mom is a badass who made sacrifices to endure medical training so he could have a good life and she could follow a passion to help others. You\u2019re a good partner as well for caring so much and supporting her.",
            "I've learned that fear is false evidence appearing real. I think you've learned something seriously important: honesty and asking rather than making assumptions and fearing the answers is where you need to go.

            "To the people who brought up divorce. It's probably why you're still single.\n\nIt's kind of ridiculous to project your own insecurities and intolerance as advice for someone else.\n\nOf course this is the internet so you're behind a computer, there's less guilt if something does go wrong based on your horrible advice.",
            "My husband worked a lot when our daughter was born and missed a lot of firsts. I used to say to him that the only time a first mattered was the first time you saw it, not the first time she did it. It wasn\u2019t the same but I think it helped him process missing out a bit better. \nI\u2019m glad you worked it out together :) ",
            "Thank you for being so supportive to your wife during residency. \n\nWe need more partners like you in the industry. I'm glad you understand the gravity of the situation, and you both are doing your best. \n\nIt gets better, there's a light at the end of the tunnel for her. ",
            "Her career is going to be demanding for her whole life. Instead of lying as a band aid, help her come to terms with her decisions; reassure her about what a great mother she is, what a great dad you are, and how happy and healthy your son is. Help her get past any guilt and sorrow. Just listen and hold her if she misses something. Make *her* first time seeing his milestones special - send a video, have him hold up a sign, write it down for his baby book for her. Focus on the example she\u2019s setting for him, the experiences and comfort her job allows your family, and the extraordinary amount she and your son are adored. \n\nYou can do this the right way.

            "I'm taking the longer view of the mom at home while dad is away (yes I'm old and my husband traveled a lot while the kids were babies). It's always the first time when both mom and dad are there to see it together. It's complicated now with every instance of everyone's lives filmed. Your mom's instinct to start that was because it was so often done when dads were away all day every day, and it was done out of love by you and by all those other moms too.\n\nAt some point, however, it has to stop and I'm happy that you two have found your ability to laugh and love together. It's along journey together, not just for the firsts!",

            "So glad for you that you two worked it out, and it\u2019s great you were able to also discuss your fears over her mental health, too. That\u2019s definitely a horrid worry to keep bottled up. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not surprised she laughed at the beanbag trick. It\u2019s both hysterical and ingenious!",

            "I\u2019m just reading your story for the 1st time and honestly, I think what you and your mom tried to do was VERY sweet. I\u2019m not a mom, but if there is anything that is worth telling a lie to someone about, this is one of them! \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Aww, that's sweet. You ARE NOT a bad husband in the least. This one definitely was a difficult situation to navigate through, and you did your best because you love your wife and want her to have a healthy emotional and mental well-being. While you may not have to worry about your wife hurting herself, it's not a totally invalid concern given her job and such. In the future, if you're worried about her (or someone else) bring it up. You don't have to be direct. Also, when your wife is home, take a few minutes to ask your wife about her day/time at work. You can use her description as well as her tone/body language to gauge her emotional state. I ask my husband this every single day, not just because I'm interested but because it gives me a lot of insight even if all he says is two words. ",
            "I'm a Nanny to infants and one of the first questions I ask Moms is \"do you want to be informed of milestones?\" \n\nI've witnessed first steps, first words, etc and some Moms want to know right away and others would prefer I didn't mention it. \n\nHonestly, the most important firsts in a child's life are the ones they will remember sharing with you. I would remind her of all the big milestones she can support your son through, and how much they will mean to him. \n\nMy Dad was in the military. He missed a lot of stuff. I don't dwell at all on the stuff my Dad wasn't present for but the things we have been able to do together are much more special. He took me to buy my prom dress, taught me how to ride a bike, taught me to drive, etc",

            "I loved going back to work.  My first day back?  He rolled over for the first time.  I honestly laughed because the irony of missing a major milestone my first day back to work was too much.  I also missed the crying at nap time and the poo-plosion.  A little fussy today? Not my problem, see-ya!\n\nI\u2019d be more upset that I didn\u2019t know when a first happened than missing it. \n\nThe biggest pro I see to being a working mom is the example I set.  My own mom had a career (higher level in the same company than my dad).  It just made working the default for me.  Not a question of IF I will work, but a question of what kind of job I wanted.  I\u2019m not saying staying at home is easy (I can\u2019t imagine how I\u2019d cope!!) but I think it gives a lot of freedom to have a career.  Freedom before you marry or have kids.  Another option/goal if you can\u2019t have kids.  Better long term financial health and retirement savings.  Freedom to leave if a marriage isn\u2019t working out.  Freedom to decide you don\u2019t have the patience to stay at home full time and would rather work instead!!!  \n\nI know I had care providers and was still close to my parents so I know the affection, closeness and love are still there.  I\u2019m glad my son had caregivers that treated him like family.  I don\u2019t feel jealous over that, I\u2019m grateful.\n\nIt still hurts not to see your kid on a normal routine.  But for the short-term these aren\u2019t lasting effects and there is a long-term payoff.   Money/career now but also the example, the very long-term effects of higher incomes and so forth.\n\nIt sounds like your wife is handling it well but I just wanted to share another working mom perspective. There are so many positives to focus on that take out the sting of the negatives.  Give her updates on poop disasters along with the milestones!!  Share the frustrations as well as the good bits.  Never complaining or guilt tripping, but just a mix.  I had to ask my husband not to text pictures of them having fun at the playground when I was working on a weekend during deadlines... show me later but in the moment it made me sad.  Sending me pictures of a horribly messy lunch that needs a hose to clean up?  That didn\u2019t make me quite so sad, lol.",

It just sucks. \nHowever, as time goes on, I\u2019ve realize how lucky my daughter is. She got two moms to love her. How lucky I am that so many people love my daughter. And that she gets to be close to her grandparents. \nI hope your wife will look back just as fondly and see the kindness and how your intentions were not to deceive her, but to love and protect her. ",

Not everyone is Elon Musk and can do the work of three people at the same time for years.\n\nThis is going to happen again and again if her job keeps her away from the family constantly.

            "I don't know if anyone said this but, I find this Interesting because I  used to work at a day care with babies and we would do this all. The. Time. If a baby had a milestone, we would say they're close to it. So, I have mixed feelings ",
            "My kids have gone to daycare since they are about 3.5 months old.  They are almost 3 years and 8 months respectively.  Daycare teachers are often the ones who get your kids first milestones.  They are very adept and reading the parents and can tell which might be heartbroken at missing the first roll or the tentative first step.  With my first, they told me that he was looking like he might be ready to roll over any day now!  He did, he rolled over that weekend, while I was videoing him.  Can I be sure it was his first roll?  No, he probably rolled over at daycare, but it was MY first time seeing it and I was SO damn proud of him as ridiculous as it seems. I am getting teary eyed remembering the moment and he will be 3 next month. \n\nWe have videos of his first steps, and I do really think they were his first, but I am not sure about his crawling, and other milestones. \n\nIt's incredibly kind what you tried to do, but we all make choices, and I understand that my working (not a doctor btw, mad props to your wife) means that I will miss things.  There are days that the videos and photos come through from daycare and I just cry quietly in my office for a few minutes because I just miss my kids in that moment.    \n\n\nYou sound like a wonderful husband and father, and damn, your mom sounds like a real amazing lady.  To be so gracious and understanding to try and help your wife feel like she didn't miss these moments, as opposed to gloating about grandma being there, tells me so much about your mom's character - especially since you said she is more traditional.  \n\nI'm so glad you two worked this out maturely and lovingly.  There are going to be more challenges to come and now that you can openly communicate better, you will get through those too, one step at a time - no beanbags required. ",

I\u2019m glad you guys were able to work through this - you obviously had the best of intentions, and you weren\u2019t lying for malicious reasons.

            "Not to minimize what your wife is going through, but stereotypically, dads are the breadwinners, and we miss tons of milestones while at work. One parent or the other may miss something, even if they were home. \n\nMy kids are now in their early 20s, and pretty much live their own lives now. When we are together, we cherish those times.  I was present for my daughter's first steps and words. I have zero recollection of my son's (who's 4 years younger)- seriously, after the first kid, and when the first one is walking and talking, you're pretty exhausted when another kid hits the scene. \n\nI was present on weekends to help coach softball games, and other \"firsts.\" Your wife will likely be present for first day at school, plays, graduation, etc. \n\nProps to your wife for being in a grueling program, while being a \"present\" mom. Present doesn't have to mean being there at every moment; that's impossible. If your child knows they're loved and emotionally supported, you're \"there\" all the time. I think that's more important than witnessing a \"first.\" Moving forward, it's the collection of moments that make up our memories, so make the most of them. Before you know it, the kid(s) are independent, and walking out the door. That's a bittersweet \"first.\" ",
            "I missed the original post but this is easily one of the cutest screwups I have seen in this forum.  It's very obvious you love your wife OP! Glad she was able to get over the (well intentioned) lies.",
            "This happens to me a lot because I work full time and the commute isn't short. Sometimes I only get to see my kids for like 30-60 minutes a day during the week. It's rough. Sometimes people don't tell me things happen, and I didn't how I feel about that. I know that realistically I'm going to miss stuff, I'm gone for like 10-11 hrs a day.\n\nBut sometimes them not telling me means I get to see their new tricks first hand, so it's a nice surprise anyway. They walk around, they wave, they say \"uh oh\" and \"hello\" a lot.",

            "Best husband ever! I hope to have what your wife has in the future!!",
            "The only think that make it up to her is to actually make her understand you did it to make it easy on her and your options were limited. Then discuss how would you to deal with things like in the future? Wish I could take more time being insightful it seems you love this women and you prioritized you love over morality and as upsetting as that is it can\u2019t be next hearing every big milestone you child had constantly but she still feels she missed and was lied all at the same time so just tell what it meant to you. That you didn\u2019t count the milestones when she was gone but when you were both present and she was there. Hope that helps ",
            "I've never got this \"firsts\" thing at all. If it was a one off, then yeah, but you can watch them do it for the rest of your life, you ain't gonna see there first a lot of things! ",
            "You did a crazy crazy thing...like soap opera crazy...i dont think missing \u201cmilestones\u201d is such a big deal to require faking them lol. As long as youre around, you get to see the general picture of progress which is probably more rewarding.\n\nYour child is pretty young but when they get just a bit older, you wont be around for all of their verbal milestones, youll only have the first time YOU hear them, which I think is just as good.",
            "Good for you. When you have your second child nobody is going to be interested in milestones anyway lol everybody is going to be just like yeah whatever As long as the baby eats, poops, and sleeps well \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",
            "OP, you may also want to consider your wife being jealous of your mother. By moving to your home, your mother is mothering that child. By the time residency is up, that child is going to know grandma as being its mother, basically, regardless of what you teach it to call them.\n\nI am sure your wife realizes this and feels terrible over it. She may also have some animosity towards her because you state your mother doesnt exactly approve of a mother being a doctor and a father a stay at home dad. ",
            "I don\u2019t understand needing to be present for these firsts so bad that you get so upset you cause this entire debacle. \n\nPerhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019m not a parent, but it just seems so stupid to me that you\u2019d get so caught up in this that you\u2019d be lying your wife about it. Similarly, it\u2019s stupid of her to be so caught up in this that she\u2019d be heartbroken by not being there.\n\nIt\u2019s not a big deal to be there the first time, its just a big deal to be there. Fucking stupid. Our lives aren\u2019t the guiniess book of world records, we arent here to set records and observe firsts, we\u2019re just here to live. There is no significant difference between the first steps and the second steps.",
            "I\u2019m so glad that you worked it out. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s sad that she missed the milestones. I was there for most of my children\u2019s...though there\u2019s never \u201cgood\u201d lies, I would have liked to have someone recreate things for me had I missed the big ones. ",
            "Awww <3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also laughed at the bean bag trick.\n\nYou were well intentioned and I'm glad she appreciated that.",
            "This is such a common thing people do. But I understand she is upset.\n\nI work a lot  but my son is happy in daycare and when my mom picks him up. It\u2019s good too know he\u2019s in the hands of someone he loves and someone who loves him back and really cares about his well being. \n\nMy mom has always worked several jobs and I was at my grandparents house a lot. She went to school when I was 3/4. I don\u2019t remember missing her at all. I remember eating pizza and watching wrestling with my grandma. I remember my grandpa taking me for rides in the car all over town. I remember my mom showing discipline and teaching me work ethic and responsibility. \n\nIt hurt her more than it hurt me.  Now that I have a toddler I\u2019m learning  it\u2019s a bittersweet feeling. Yes I miss my son and I feel like a jerk for not being there for him. But I am there for him. Just not 24/7. I need to work on myself too. I have a career and I am making decent money right now. She\u2019s stressed out and tired and working her ass off, but to throw some cliches out there: this too shall pass! The days are long and the years are short but she\u2019s almost done with her schooling. She needs to stop beating herself up! (Easier said that done, I know.)",

            "The fact that this guy loves his wife so much and cares so much about her feelings that he would go to this length to make her feel happy is truly awesome. No, lying is really not \"ok\" - I get that. It's just that he is supporting his wife and her ambition to become the best version of herself and make her dream come true to a degree that most men wouldn't even think about let alone go to this extreme to accomplish it! Yes, I absolutely understand where the wife is coming from and how hurt / betrayed she feels in the moment, but in the end, she realized that her hubby was really just trying to love her and protect her. \u2764\ufe0f",

How is that stupid?\n\nGlad the truth is out and both of you can operate  in reality.\n\nI told my wife your story and she said that you faking the first moment for your wife was cute.\n\nShe missed some milestones with our kids but had the attitude that. \"it doesn't happen unless Mommy sees it\"\n\n",

It's like you're projecting your own fears onto her. Your wife never gave you reason to believe she'd be suicidal or that she couldn't handle missing her child's milestones. You aren't supporting her by infantilizing her. Why don't you try asking her how you can relieve her stress instead of rolling with your own assumptions?\n\n&#x200B;",

        "selftext": "I posted last summer about [struggles with my husband of 5 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/), our longest dry spell being 9 months.\n\nI felt unattractive and undesirable, and wanted to have sex more often, but he was happy to never have sex again (aside from how that would affect me). I wanted to feel like a sex Goddess again. Reddit advised me all kinds of things, from checking testosterone, to therapy, and even that there was no hope and if I wanted to feel like a Goddess again, I'd have to leave him. The [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c96jun/i_34f_feel_unattractive_and_my_husband_41m_of_5/estjlke?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) that hit me hardest was jimmyjrdanceparty's who pointed out that I was allowed to feel the way I did.\n\nWell, I feel like a Goddess again, everyone! :D\n\nWhat happened? I decided to go to individual therapy, and focus on myself, work on myself. My physical self-image was a symptom of a larger problem. Troubles at work, troubles at home, a storm inside. During counselling, I opened the door to a cellar where I had been keeping my true self locked in the dark - ashamed of her. I was bullied as a kid, and I had no idea I had accumulated so much self-loathing since then. Releasing that was amazing and so freeing!\n\nAnd so, by the time I said goodbye to my counsellor, I was stronger and more self-assured. I realised I had been sacrificing so much of myself for the sake of others (especially the important men in my life - my husband, my boss, my father, my manager, etc). I was constantly seeking approval, trying to please them. My relationships had gotten completely out of balance.\n\nThings started to get complicated. I developed a crush on a colleague, and because I am demisexual, my attraction to my husband started to diminish. The more time passed the more I felt like I just didn't care anymore what he thought of me.\n\nAt a low point, I said to my husband: \"You know, you always keep your thoughts to yourself. I used to find it mysterious and interesting - like a puzzle I could unwrap. But now I realise that there's actually no mystery to unravel. There's just nothing. And the silence is boring.\" It was hurtful and unkind. I'm not proud of it. Something changed after that. Both for him, and for me.\n\nOver the course of the next few months I gave less, and I took more. I went to conferences, I left the kids with my husband, I took time off work, I stopped making up for the mistakes of my superiors at work and let them deal with the consequences of their actions. I felt like I was coming home to my true self - my no nonsense kickass self.\n\nOne night my husband and I were watching Alien, and he confessed that ever since he'd seen the original as a boy, he'd really liked Ripley. She was the kind of woman he had wanted to marry. And so he married me. You should've seen my face, the tears wouldn't stop. I felt like he had finally told me what I needed to hear the most.\n\nI got rid of my attraction to my colleague. It's actually not that hard as a demi, I just focused on everything I didn't like about them, and within a week or two the crush was totally gone. I find them a total turn-off now.\n\nDo you remember I mention I wasn't able to initiate sex? That's because it was a huge turn-off for my husband. One evening we discussed why, and you know what? He felt too much pressure if I initiated, because he thought he'd have to perform. Once he realised that he can safely turn me down if he's not in the mood - and also that's it's OK for us to kiss and cuddle without it leading to something more - he's been OK with me initiating. You'd think you wouldn't get to age 40 without having figured that out, but hey... I guess people never cease to throw surprises!? Haha!\n\nOur sex life improved a lot. I no longer needed his praise to sooth my self-loathing, so I was less needy about it. He initiated a bit more often. But more importantly, with greater enthusiasm and quality! He chooses what I wear sometimes - and I feel so beautiful when he looks at me like I am the only being that matters. And he compliments me! We even got into a bit of light D/s, which has spiced things up a lot!\n\nEven though I had fallen out of love with him for a while, I have fallen back in love with my husband stronger and harder than ever before!! I couldn't be happier, I love myself, and I love him so SO much!! He's just the best partner I could ever wish for! <3\n\nThank you reddit for helping me through one of the hardest lows in my life, and thank you especially jimmyjrdanceparty for your advice and encouragement.\n\nTLDR: I felt unattractive and my husband didn't want sex.

            "I\u2019m so glad a situation like this turned into something positive and happy on Reddit and not something I saw over on /r/gonewildstories. \n\nIt\u2019s good to read a story about who adults experiencing sexual problems in the relationship handling it like adults. Not turning it into a cheat fest, which many couples do, or a dead bedroom situation.\n\nAnd you\u2019re a fucking badass to for going to therapy and figuring out your shit! That\u2019s so fucking awesome. And I hope to do that someday myself!",

            "My boyfriend and I have different sex drives (I\u2019m 25 and he\u2019s 35) and I usually get a little upset and felt rejecting. I\u2019ve been seeing a therapist for about 2 years and I feel more confident in my own skin, but I\u2019m curious... did you bring up your sex life to him/her? I guess I\u2019ve never realized how sex ties into our self esteem so much. I want him to be able to safely turn me down to, which I admit I fail to not take it personally sometimes",

            "It's probably an unpopular opinion, so I'm ready for the backlash, but here goes. I understand wanting to work on yourself and I'm glad you resolved your issues and found positivity and love in your life. But it just seemed that in that journey you treated your husband and your colleague very unkindly which could have been avoided. And even that is fine, as everyone makes choices that hurt others, but what I find worrying is your lack of remorse. \n\nIt would have made sense if these issues were caused by them, but like you said it was your own personal perspective of yourself.\n\nI just find this worrying, and someone should notice this.\n\nAnyway, I'm glad you're happy now and hope everyone else in your life is too.",

Things will get complicated again eventually, it's important for both of you to have the tools to go through the next issues better prepared and with the training of working things out AS A TEAM. \n\nI just read this update and haven't read all the comments so I don't know if he's been to therapy or not.\n\nWhat I wanted to say is don't lower your guard because things are better. You both need to keep working in your couple's communication.\n\nBest of wishes OP",

I love that you have developed a different frame of mind as a result and it shows that any circumstance that we are in can change for the better if we do the work.  I actually see this all the time with people who work on themselves and learn to be better about communicating effectively.  This just reinforces those thoughts for me.  I really appreciate you posting this and I am very happy that you had the determination to care for yourself and as a result have a happier life.  It always starts with us.  If we can learn to work on that first, things will fall into place in a beautiful way.  Yay, I got the good chills.  <3",

And the silence is boring.\" Is a fear that my GF has this thought of me very often. I'm in my head a lot. How did your husband change after that comment?\n\nI too carry a lot of low-self esteem baggage and always aimed to be the people pleaser. I don't really like it that much and I'm beginning to notice it again in my relationship.

            "Wow this is such an inspiring change.\nI hated myself since I was a child. I was bullied too. A lot. Mostly by boys when I was in school. And they used to bully me physically too sometimes. So I felt really ugly since then. And sometimes. I feel like that girl I was. And I feel weak and ugly. And I hate it. And then I realised that I have that image of myself. The image of when I was a child. And I just can't stop hating it. I tried to go to therapy. And they've also told me to stop hating it. But I can't. \nThat's why I'm so insecure. And I feel like shit everytime I like a boy. Because I always think they're out of my league and they will never like me back. (which I mean, can be true). \nBut the feelings I get when I like someone are completely terrible... I start hating myself so much. I feel so sad and useless and ugly. And not feminine. And I feel like that girl that was bullied and called bad things for her appearance... \n:( I'm sad. Lol.",

Then screech, it was like someone flipped a switch. Now looking at our 28th anniversary, I used to get it on my birthday and sometimes Christmas. He says he\u2019s got ED . Ok , but, he won\u2019t aggressively do anything to help. I\u2019m about 180 degrees opposite. I have always had a very healthy sex drive . We used to joke about me being a nymphomaniac . Now, I don\u2019t ask for it because frankly it makes me feel bad about myself. Especially after he gives his usual answer and I\u2019m not to care or stop wanting sex . I\u2019m even said we can just cuddle and just body contact. He won\u2019t do anything but thinks I shouldn\u2019t have a right to say anything about this . If I dare mention it, it just makes us both feel bad ! \nQuestion; do I leave or have lover on the side or suggest a throuple?

Unfortunately, there wasn't a happy ending, but I am very grateful for a lot of the advice I received here. Thank you, reddit, for helping me keep my head on straight!\n\nAfter I made my first post, I read all the comments and thought about everything for a few days. A lot of people mentioned that they would not be comfortable with the frequency of my communication with my ex. I thought that was very fair. People also mentioned that Mark's behavior was pretty controlling and not ok. I also thought that was fair.\n\nI went to talk to Mark and told him that I understood if he was uncomfortable with me being in touch with Eli weekly, and that I would be totally willing to cut that down. I also reiterated again that I was not currently in love with Eli and hadn't been for a while. Mark was understanding this time and seemed happy with the fact that I offered to cut down my contact with Eli.\n\nBut then I told Mark that although I was willing to do this, I wasn't happy with how he approached the issue and that I found his behavior controlling. I basically told him that I want him to approach issues in a more rational way and I would appreciate if he opened a dialogue rather than just telling me what to do, and that I wouldn't put up with him trying to \"command\" me to do something (especially something so ridiculous). I said everything in the same tone as I used for the first half of the conversation - I wasn't yelling at him or admonishing him, just trying to let him know where my boundaries are.\n\nYou guys - Mark. Flew. Off. The. Handle. He started SCREAMING at me. I obviously wasn't having it, so I got up to leave. He started throwing dishes and random kitchen items at me, and grabbed me and slammed my head into the door jam. I ended up with a nasty black eye and a busted lip. Luckily for me, a neighbor heard the commotion and called the cops. Mark was arrested and I was taken to the hospital. Yes, I'm pressing charges and filed for a restraining order.\n\nOverall, it was a horrible incident but I'm glad this happened earlier in the relationship rather than later. And I am forever grateful for the neighbor who called the cops. Im also grateful to (most of) you guys for telling me that I wasn't being insane in my first post and for pointing out the early warning signs. It wasn't the best ending, but I'm ok and I'm just glad it's over. Take this as a cautionary tale, I guess!\n\nTLDR: tried to have a rational conversation with Mark, he gave me a black eye and busted lip, it's over (thank God).\n\nEDIT: I've gotten a lot of concerned messages (which I appreciate!) telling me to watch out for Mark now and that abusers are often at their most dangerous right after a breakup. Just to ease everyone's mind: I'm staying with a classmate (who Mark does not know) for the time being, so I'm well-protected! Thanks everyone!",

Many times. I was with him up until the night before he went to jail after he was out on bond. He never changed. Do not fall for it when he manipulates you and gets you to come running back! \n\nAnd HE WILL TRY. So please, be strong. Don't let it get worse.

That kind of \u201cerasing\u201d attempt for anyone else in your life is textbook and toxic. He\u2019d have isolated you from family and friends next (if he wasn\u2019t already doing so).\n\nSorry you got hurt OP, stay strong, remember it\u2019s not your fault. (Ps I also disagree with you communicating with your ex being this huge issue, you\u2019re broken up, in the context of your apparent text pattern of texting hundreds of times a day, it was barely anything. And I suspect as you grew further apart it would likely die down naturally anyway. Just wanted to add that part because people policing how much you communicate with your ex is also controlling).",

Personally I\u2019m 27 and I tried to put myself in his shoes being close to his age after I read the first post but after about 2 minutes of thought I also thought it was bullshit. If you love a girl at this age you have to accept the fact that there was definitely someone important in their life before you. You can\u2019t deny them that ever and have to accept that. If you\u2019re concerned the best way to confront it is by just being there for all of it. You want a girl you have to accept everyone in their life, whether it be an ex or an annoying friend. Regardless you have to accept them and accept they will probably be a part of your life too. If you put up a barrier you\u2019re just asking for trouble. Just my 2 cents.\n\n\n\nAlso though, fuck mark, fuck his violence, he\u2019s a fucking idiot.",

            "I'm glad you saw very early in your relationship how abusive he is; that he was gracious enough to show you his controlling/abusive side. It's much better than realizing it after you've invested years into it where your feelings are more cemented and more difficult to detach. In a way, I suppose it's lucky? Messed up, I know.\n\nAlthough, I wanted to say something: in your previous post there were some people who were complaining that you and your ex were exchanging 50-100 texts a day, and I thought that was bizarre. What the hell, how is that off? It's your lover, your partner; you enjoy each other's company and want more of it. My husband and I also EXCHANGE (emphasis on *exchange*) as many texts a day, too, and the reason is because we just have things to talk about. I mean, it's not *exactly* daily, but it is for the majority of the days of the week; when he goes to work, we always still text and talk about silly things. I send him things to keep him \"entertained\" while he's at work and might be bored and he tells me about the things that are actively happening... or we discuss current events/politics/social issues/the kids... we do this because we have a good rapport with one another and actively *enjoy each other's company*. I was so weirded out by people complaining about that. But who knows, maybe it's mine and my husband's relationship that's weird and \"unhealthy\" (yeah right). \n\nAnyway, I'm really glad you're alright (although we're simply strangers!), and I hope you're able to move on from this asap. Good luck!",

That's the time when they are likely to act out violently and they will often ignore restraining orders.  \n\nPlease look into changing your locks, and having a friend or relative stay with you.  Also warn your employer about this guy in case he tries to call or show up at your workplace.  Be safe, OP, and congrats on being strong and standing your ground- it takes a lot of courage!",

You handled this so well so I don't have much to add except that you really don't have to ever doubt the appropriateness of your relationship with your ex. It sounds perfectly healthy and believe me there are guys out there who won't give a shit because they have healthy boundaries themselves. My ex, the first guy I ever said I love you to, only other I've said it to except for my current partner is one of my best friends. He came to visit me and my boyfriend in our new city, we talk all the time, we are pretty close basically. My partner has never had an issue with it because he knows I have zero romantic feelings for him anymore and he trusts me.

You shouldn't cut contact with someone you've always been friends with just because your partner is insecure.\nMy boyfriend has friends, girls, he knows since he was young (one of them was his first girlfriend) and yet I never asked him to cut contact with any of them.

Maybe it's different for my husband and I because we use the chat feature in gmail (computer web browser and phone app - it's our only method of written communication, we do not use the standard text feature) so because of that we probably exchange way more \"texts\" than that a day. We both have office jobs and basically have the chat box open all day on our work computers.

            "It\u2019s really strange that this happened 6 months in. I\u2019m not questioning you, it just is. I think it might be because the two of you are young(er). I\u2019m a 29F dating a 37M for the past 6 months, and being older we\u2019ve both been around the block (actually both had 7 year relationships, he had additional 4 year and 3 year ones on top) and we discussed exes and our past romances, what we\u2019ve learned, how we felt, pretty quick. I mean, it was hesitant at first because nobody wants to hear the person they\u2019ve been dating for 2-3 months wax on and on about some great past romance, but by 4-5 months in when we were official we\u2019d discussed our past relationships at length. Talked about how they changed us, what things we loved and hated about the other person. What the dealbreakers were that lead to the end.\n\nMark is not an adult, he\u2019s an angry shitty little child. Adults can talk about these things. Can understand that just because you didn\u2019t piss on your ex\u2019s pillow and incinerate their shit (hyperbole, but you know what I mean: because you don\u2019t despise them and even *gasp* still hold some forms of fondness and love for them) doesn\u2019t mean that you aren\u2019t COMPLETELY 100% POSITIVE that it is OVER romantically between the two of you. I think of my ex as an annoying family member, like a cousin or something. \n\nI\u2019m so happy for you that you got out. I hope you have better luck next time, seriously. I hope you\u2019re taking care of yourself because I\u2019m sure you\u2019re really shaken up.

I was majorly panicking when I wrote the post, and the comments I got helped a ton to get me to relax before talking to Noah. I wasn't expecting such a huge response at the time and I was amazed, but looking back now I can see why it got so much attention. It was a pretty weird situation.\n\nNext, I want to say we are both men (apparently this makes a big difference for some people in terms of advice). Some of the people who assumed I was a woman also made some weird comments and sent me some pretty gross messages. If you did this, please stop. That's not cool.\n\nI gave a bit of an update as an edit to the original post, but now since it's been 3 months I thought I'd give you all an update about how things have been going since then, since it seems like there's been a bit of interest, and I'm still really thankful to all of you for helping me out.\n\nNoah is doing really well. I could tell he was still a bit embarrassed for the first couple weeks, but after that he told me again that he was still happy he asked me because now he knew how I felt and he could get over it. He also thanked me for taking it so well, which is definitely thanks to what a lot of you said, so I guess I'm sort of passing his thanks on to you :P\n\nOne of the commenters said I should be careful not to do anything that seemed like flirting with him, so I tried keep that in check (we used to hug a lot, sit really close together, and tell each other flirty jokes, you get the idea, but I toned those all down a lot to give him space and not mess with his feelings). I honestly think I see now why he thought I might be into him, because my relationship with him was very affectionate. It's been a lesson for me on how to be more aware of how other people are interpreting my signals.\n\nAbout a month after he asked me out, he asked me if I wanted to go to a gay bar with him. He made it super clear that it wasn't a date, but he did it in a really sarcastic way, which was a little embarrassing for me but also I think it was good that he could joke about it. So we went to a local gay bar together and we had a really good time. He's a bit introverted, so I played the wingman, and he ended up flirting with this really cute guy and he just seemed really happy.\n\nThat was like two months ago and we've gone to the same bar a couple more times since then. He's been getting a bit more comfortable putting himself out there which is really cool to see, and he's just been more open and happy for the last two months, always smiling and eager to go do stuff. Not sure how it's related but it's a noticeable change from before he asked me out.\n\nI'm doing great too. I'm just really happy that I didn't hurt our relationship and that he's so happy. I also learned some important things from this whole situation about communication and being aware of how I present myself. Important lessons. I actually think I feel more confident now too, since he asked me out. Getting asked out feels good man.\n\nIt sounds kind of weird, but I think it made us closer. We've started talking about relationships more, which isn't something we really talked about before. He's gone on a few dates and he tells me about them, and the most recent guy he went out with he was really excited about, and I think he might be headed for his first serious relationship, which is amazing! That's actually what made me think of this post and decide to give you all an update.\n\nTL;DR: So yeah, our relationship wasn't ruined and I still have my best friend. He's doing really well and I love seeing him so happy.\n\nThanks again for the help!",

I\u2019ve always hated stereotypically male interactions and the space that friendship gave me to be myself helped me grow into the person I am now. Super gay! Just kidding. Still straight.

I also want to say that you\u2019ve got a very kind, warm and inviting spirit. You\u2019re aware of how your actions might and can affect others especially your best friend and that\u2019s a wonderful trait to have. \n\nThat being said, I think it\u2019s so easy to joke with friends on a level that outsiders may see as flirting. And it\u2019s also very easy to not realize that you\u2019re doing it. A year after I graduated high school, a new kid in town that started attending the same school who was also a year younger than me had confessed to me that he had a crush on me. However, I felt the same way you feel for Noah. He was one of those rare people who you meet and after 5 minutes of getting to know them, you feel like you\u2019ve known each other since you were babies. \n\nHe was a very infectious person to be around and he still is to this day and we\u2019re in our very early 30\u2019s now. But he confessed to me and I also had to tell him that as much as I love him, it\u2019s just not that type of love and I value him so much, I didn\u2019t want to lose him over that. I\u2019m so happy that we\u2019re still great friends after all this time. I last saw him on Thanksgiving day and it felt like being kids all over again. Gave him a huge hug, asked about his family and how they\u2019re doing and vice versa and we said our I love you\u2019s and went on to go see our families. I love that it\u2019s not weird or worse that I can\u2019t even speak to him. I know how you feel and it\u2019s a great feeling. I\u2019m so happy for you both. ",

We made out that night and then dated for nearly 6 months, moved in together. He dumped me for the one ex I never met (I was abroad while they dated), and she also hated me for some reason. She\u2019s 21. Now I\u2019m 20, he\u2019s 19 and haven\u2019t talked in about 4 months. I\u2019m assuming she doesn\u2019t let him talk to me because I\u2019ve tried texting him like 5 times, of course friendly and nothing romantic because he certainly was my best friend ever... but never got a response so I\u2019ve pretty much given up on that. \n\n\nI even still talk to his mom sometimes, nothing weird though, we had been friends for about 4 years before all this went down and she\u2019s still really kind to me.

I was emboldened by the support and, strangely enough, even some of the negative comments. I came home from work and blurted it out, straight and to the point. I told him that I wasn\u2019t happy, I hadn\u2019t been for a while, and that we would be separating. We agreed that he could stay in the extra bedroom for a few months while we got everything sorted but when the lease was up we would be going our separate ways. \n\nThe last few months have been hard. He went into full blown panic mode, promised to change in the ways I had waited years for, and had several actual melt downs begging me to stay. It was painful, but my resolve to live my own life never wavered. \n\nI just signed a new lease (by myself) and have begun to casually date someone in the same field as me. Life has an excitement to it that I haven\u2019t felt in years, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve taken my first deep breath in a long time. \n\nSo, if you\u2019re on the fence about leaving someone but your lives are so enmeshed that you don\u2019t see how it is possible: put yourself first, there is always a way out. Thank you! \n\nTLDR: I broke up with my codependent boyfriend and am the happiest I have been in years. ",

Until my cancer came back and i needed surgery and was sick and recovering for the past 6 months. He continued his life in the meantime, and developed a lot. While i was \u2018just\u2019 recovering. Now i\u2019m the \u2018codependent\u2019 one, as in i need him more than he needs me. Should i break up with him to allow him to move on with his life?

            "I just did the same and it is so liberating. I (23M) was with a guy (33 M) and we dated for about 9 months. He didn\u2019t have a job when I met him, he claimed it was bc he just moved back from Florida. I came to find out, he didn\u2019t just move back from Florida, and he had been back for almost a year. He always insisted he was going to get a job, and it never happened. He was clingy, insecure, and always accused me of being about to leave him, which strangely enough PREVENTED me from leaving him because I didn\u2019t want to prove him right. Finally, I just had enough after he had berated me for about 2 hours straight. I told him I was done (via text, I\u2019m not proud, but it was necessary) and haven\u2019t texted him since. This was maybe a month ago (the day that season 33 of The Challenge on MTV started) and he has been blowing up my phone from different numbers ever since, has spent the night in my driveway (which he did a couple times when we were dating, just to spy on me) but I still feel free. Best decision I ever made, although I was scared at first because he always threatened to hurt himself if I left him. Good job, OP!! It\u2019s hard, but SO rewarding!",
            "Are you me? I was in this exact same situation last year, though additionally complicated by medical issues and him being from out of state. I finally got up the courage to break it off about 7 months ago. I always thought I was happy in that relationship, but now that I know what happy actually feels like, I know it was just complacency. Enjoy your happiness and never settle!",

I've been through a very similar situation myself recently - my (now) ex-girlfriend doesn't get on with her own family, doesn't have that many friends, and said so often that she wouldn't know what to do without me. Gradually, I fell out of love with her and I think part of that was that I spent so much of my time worrying about her or focusing on her problems that I could never really take the time to look after myself.\n\nWe're also currently having to live together until the lease runs out and it is tough and awkward, but I know that in 6 months-1 year's time, things will have worked out for the best.",
            "If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned through my failed relationships it\u2019s that codependency is, more often than not, going to lead to an unhappy relationship and ending. People need their own lives in order to be happy, and sharing their lives with someone makes the relationship more exciting, as you can show each other new things and places, as well as continue to enjoy those things separately. \n\nBeing \u201cone\u201d entity and losing identity is a really unhealthy thing to do, especially in a society that thrives off of personal identity.",

Thank you for your inspiration, I know that I will be ok one day as well \ud83d\ude0a\u2764\ufe0f",
            "Just read through some of the old comments. People are jerks!\n\nPeople that accuse you of being narcissistic for describing how codependent he was? .......why? Why do that? Seriously, talk about insult to injury. Hey we see you're struggling to take action, now take this hit to your self esteem, that oughta do it. So if they aren't helping you, why say it? Because they are projecting themselves into the situation, and defending themselves unnecessarily. And they are projecting the abuse. Because that is what abusers do, they see you are about to leave and they belittle you into feeling like you are the problem so you lose motivation to leave.\n\nPeople saying you're definitely not going to leave him. Well, they were wrong and I hope they take this as a lesson in seeing that people actually do get held accountable \n\nGuys saying \"can't believe people just dump people for their own personal gain\"\n\nYes!! Yes we do! Yes you should! A relationship is a partnership, two partners are strong separately but are stronger together than they would be going alone. Though they may struggle at times, they rely on each other when they need support and return the favor, a symbiotic relationship. A relationship where one person puts in all of the work and sustains all of the effort and is held back by the other person and gets little in return is not symbiotic, it's parasitic\n\nIf you don't have a disability or illness, chronic or temporary, and just aren't putting in the work to be your own person, it's not anyone's job to make you do it. It's your responsibility. I say this as someone with a disability, I put in a heroic amount of effort to be a good partner in the ways that I can be, because my disability makes it a challenge in many areas. It's exhausting at times and my partner doesn't hold it against me because he knows I'm trying. Even with my struggles, I still manage to provide support and a relationship that benefits him more than being single would.\n\nIf there's no self-awareness and no effort being made, it's toxic. The saying is \"in sickness and in health\" not \"in sickness forever, you're my slave now\"",

            "Congrats! OP, I was in the same boat as you in a way, I was with my ex for almost three years, I had been suffering so much subconsciously about wondering if I wanted to stay with him or not, it was actually affecting my physical well-being. I was just not happy anymore with him, and finally took a leap. It was tough, but sure enough about a week later I felt so free! For people in a situation like this, just understand that it will get better, I am in such a great relationship now that I never would have experienced if I didn't break up with my ex-boyfriend. ",
            "You must\u2019ve moved on long ago to start casually dating after such a long relationship. Probably speaks volumes to just how bad it was with your ex. ",
            "Sounds like it was for the best, I'm glad you two are going your separate ways. Ending up in spots like this is why I've seriously extended my casual dating period before titles/commitments/obligations. I want to see if someone has ambition that matches mine, or if our goals are different that they at least complement one another, before I start getting serious about our future. I can't be carrying people anymore.\n\nAnd the best part is -- people like your boyfriend and my exes don't need you and I pushing them either! If they're happy to stagnate at 21, if that's the life that fulfills them, then I think they should have a partner that agrees and would live that life with them. <3 ",

            "Lived with my ex for 3 and 1/2 years and we did everything together. We split bills, got a dog and a cat, we eventually stopped hanging out with our friends more and more. At the end of our 4 years together it was basically just me and him and our families but we didn't see them that much. He was my life and I was his and we only had each other. It wasn't a good relationship towards the end and I thought about breaking it off too many times. What stopped me was the fear of starting over, moving out, not having that help, not having my old friends anymore. I only talked to him and hung out with him so my life was pretty dull and that played a huge part. He decided to move away over 2,000 miles and I was so scared and not ready for it. But he needed to better himself and I understood that. So he left and now I've been opening up more and having more of a social life. I really think we held each other back and I love him and always will but it was definitely better this way. No more fighting over everything and going to sleep pissed off almost every night. He's happy where he is and I'm finally happy and feel like I have my life back. Being codependent was rough and it sucked to start over but I feel 100% better and outta the slump. Anyone who isn't happy and stays because theyre scared should remember, you are you're own person and you need to live your life. Don't worry about the other person as much and put your happiness first! ",

I guess this is what we call tough love... just hoping it's truly for the best <3 Reading this helps, even if just for a little bit... ",

            "I was similar to OP's boyfriend.  My ex and I had been together for around 4 years and were best friends for about a year before that when she broke up with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike OP's boyfriend, my ex was my world. By the end of our relationship I was not in a good place. I had been unemployed for a very long time, I was broke, and quite honestly I had very little motivation to do much at all.  I was totally caught by surprise when it happened. She had given hints to me that I needed to change, or at the very least that  I needed help, but they were never direct.  I'm by no means saying she had an obligation to do so, but it would have been nice for her to have a real discussion with me about her needs from me before she pulled the plug. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer breaking up with me was the most painful thing I've ever experienced in my life.  I told her that this was the wake up call that I needed. I told her that I was going to make changes in my life for the better going forward. I told her that I was going to do what I needed to do whether or not she was there with me, but that I really would like it if she could be there with me while I did. She told me that she couldn't give me the answer right then and there. That was the last time I actually had a conversation with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's been almost a year since the breakup and I made the changes that I said I would. The first step was getting therapy and medication for my anxiety and depression. Getting my anxiety treated really opened up the world for me. I finally learned how to drive after being terrified of it for over a decade. I conquered my fear of flying on airplanes.  Most importantly, I was finally able to really sit down and work towards getting a job. I contacted my career counselor and got advice from him. I started doing volunteer work to add things to my resume and make connections. Ultimately it worked, and after being unemployed for literally years while we were together, I landed a job in my field within 3 months of the breakup. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I happy that she broke up with me? Certainly not. Frankly, a lot of the happiness as to what I've accomplished gets met with a lot of sadness that I can't share it with her. But it would be disingenuous to say that it didn't push me into getting my life together. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo for people in the position OP was in I'd say that breaking up with someone might be what's best for them. I'd just like to add that I really think you should have a very clear, direct conversation about what has been bothering you and what needs to change before you do.",

            "Sorry for my unpopular point of view. I understand that you were not happy in your 1 decade long relationship because he was not keeping un the pace with you. But you started dating in the next few months. Were you still living with him when you started dating again? Or were you freshly moved out when you started dating?\n\nBecause it seems to me that you just want validation. You dumped him because he was lazy? He's the bad one and you're the good one for being hard working....hmmm. I think the truth is somewhere in the lines of: you fell out of love with him and wanted a new romantic partner.  \n\nBut that won't bring a successful amount of validation for you.\n\n",
            "Tbh, how do you string someone along for so long and then just end it? I get you need to break up with him at some point, but why wait 10 whole years if he wasnt getting his shit together?",
            "I never understood why people start dating after a relationship ....especially a long one.\n\nOne would think you would take time after the relationship to do things for yourself, work on yourself, grow as an individual and think more about your life and the direction it's going in in general ...before going back into the dating scene.\n\nBut I suppose wondering why people do things would only be a waste of time.",

It was one of the hardest things I have ever done and also pretty terrifying to strike out on my own. But 2 years later I am independent, great full time career, beautiful downtown loft, and I found the love of my life. Everyday is a new experience and I'm making memories I will cherish forever. Sometimes you just have to change and never look back. \ud83d\udda4 ",
            "Ugh you can't imagine how much I needed to read this today \u2665\ufe0f Thanks, stranger!",
            "Wait, you broke up and are already dating someone? Why not just actually say that's why you broke actually wanted to break up. Something is off if you were able to date that fast.",
            "I\u2019m not meaning to pick things apart, but you say that you wanted to live your own life - then start dating someone else? Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been on the other side, but I don\u2019t get that bit. ",
            "Good for you!!! I\u2019ve been there and I know the relief you are feeling!",
            "This makes me happy, congratulations <3 <3",

            "YAAAAS! Good for you! Happy you found the resolve to walk through the discomfort to get what you needed!!!",
            "You just have to do it.  My ex told me I was everything she could ever want in a partner, lover, and life companion.  She could not leave her abusive family though, and didn't believe in my ability that I would make sure we were taken care of.  In the last year I've traveled to Colorado, Minnesota, and Texas.  Each time I made it from the bottom up.  I'm back in my home state ATM, Missouri.  I loved her big time, but she wouldn't part with the one thing holding us back.",
            "You did right by yourself good for you. He\u2019ll figure it out. ",
            "I was the guy that got left behind. I never saw it coming. I tried to give my best. ",
            "I felt like I was reading my own story from about 4 years ago. Realizing that you aren\u2019t their everything is one of the most freeing experiences. I know that we\u2019re both better off and wished I could\u2019ve broken up sooner. You\u2019re right to just be straight up and honest. Kudos to you! And I hope you\u2019re living your best life! ",
            "I have almost the same situation. I was so unsure about making the decision, but now I feel more confident. ",
            "I have a question. Do you think about him positively ever? Now that you've split up and are happier.",
            "You just have to do it.",
            "Amen to this!! I have been separated from my husband for 2 months and it\u2019s the best decision I\u2019ve made. ",
            "One thing to say:\n\nCongratulations!  Now go enjoy the shit out of life.",

            "TLDR; If you don't get a Bachelors Degree/go to Trade School, you're just a 21 yr old silly boy.  Lul.",
            "I'm glad you were able to get yourself out of a situation you didnt want to be in, but this story just makes me cringe and triggers so much anxiety..\n\nI feel like this is exactly what's gonna happen to me when I get in a relationship. I'm a 24 year old Male and ugh, I hate what this is making me think of.",
            "Thank you for sharing this, ive just found myself in a similar position, its such a relief to hear somebody coming out of this too, it gave me some direction and perspective which im sure anybody who has been in this situation can agree, can get blurred. Peace and love \ud83d\udc95 ",

            "I feel bad for the dude if you\u2019re already dating after a few short months.\n\nSounds to me like you were dishonest for quite a while.\n\nPeoples emotions are not toys to be played with. Instead, like the garbage person you probably are, you lead him on for probably months. Likely because it was inconvenient for you to break up.\n\nKarma will come around to you. \n\nPoor guy deserves better than you anyways. ",
            "Honest question: was the guy you're casually dating the reason you decided to finally leave? I'm just curious. I read the OP; I'd have left too.",
            "Amen girl, good for you. Always ALWAYS put yourself first. Your happiness always matters. :) \n\nNow I wish my SO would do the same and leave me. ",
            "Are you still living with him? If yes, I don't think that's really fair to the person you're dating. I wouldn't be comfortable with it, personally. ",
            "I understand that. I don\u2019t think about her or what she is doing, just the fact I can\u2019t seem to talk to women outside of being friends. I have no trouble interacting with them, it\u2019s the transition to where I actually am attracted to them. I immediately assume I\u2019m not good enough and they won\u2019t like me. Once I feel that, I no longer have the ability to talk to them",
            "I know, but how can i if i dont have any friends at the min?\nIm 24 electrician shes 21.\n\nI find it hard to socialise sometimes aswell but ive been working on it alot this past year.\n\nI live with her also\n\n",

            "I didn\u2019t read the first post and not saying this bout you. Sometimes you gotta learn how to fix things when you feel \u201cthings have run its course\u201d I take the song pi\u00f1a colada as a good example. \n\nEdit:this is the reason why no one nowadays can stay together. Seems like a few ppl are butthurt listen to the song or look up the lyrics ",
            "Something really irked me about the post. You started casually dating. Like immediately. You clearly haven\u2019t loved the poor dude for a long time. You probably should have been a little more honest and mentioned more to the fact that he\u2019s not just holding you back in life from \u201cbeing an adult and doing the things in life you want to do\u201d but also that he\u2019s holding you back from seeing new people. You mentioning the fact that you\u2019re dating someone in the same field showed that you already had someone lined up. Nothing wrong with any of that but the poor sap who\u2019s in love with you probably deserved that bit of honesty."
