        "selftext": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3g6j8y/me_33_m_widower_i_am_scared_to_death_about/\n\nI wanted to thank everybody for the kind words in my first post.  Honestly it meant the world to me.  Trying to balance new feelings against the guilt of feeling like I'm betraying my wife is still a struggle but I am getting better at it.\n\nThe reason for this update is to let you know how Saturday's date went.  If I wasn't at the center of this I would probably find this funny but as it stands I am embarrassed (but I will admit looking back I still find it funny).\n\nStacey came over about mid day Saturday and we were going to watch a movie that both of us wanted to see that was on Netflix.  One of the posters in my first thread suggested that when I was sitting next to her on the couch that I should put my arm around her.  I thought this was a good idea and a way to just see where things go.\n\nFirst of all a giant thank you to the person who wrote that, can't remember the name right now, it was perfect.  As we were sitting on the couch she sat down right next to me.  I slipped my arm around her and she immediately laid her head on my shoulder.  We watched a little of the movie then she started to hold my hand.  I looked down at her and we started kissing.  Well one kiss led to another and things escalated from there.  Just before the big event was about to occur she asks me if I have any protection.  D'oh!!!!\n\nI then tell her I don't and this is when things went from playful to dead serious in a matter of seconds.  She ask's me what have I been using for protection.  I then explain that I haven't been using anything because this was the very first time I had been with someone in almost 4 1/2 years.  I guess she had no idea.  This then led to a me explaining she is the first girl I have even dated.  For whatever reason this made her tear up a little which freaked me out.  Believe me the last thing I wanted was to upset her and mind you I am sitting on my couch in only my underwear and very excited.  I start to apologize and tell her I'm sorry for upsetting her.  She tells me not to be silly and that she just got overcame with emotion because it made her feel very special and we hugged.  She of course is in her underwear as well so the hugging did not help my excitement any.  \n\nShe of course is finding this funny.  We both get dressed to go to the store as I then had to confess I've never worn a condom in my life.  My wife and I were just very very very lucky when we were kids.  I used to just pull out early which after I got older I realized how dumb that was.\n\nAnyway we go and she picks out a box and we head back home.  She kisses me as I am coming through the door and we start all over again.  She has figured out that there is a place on my neck that she can kiss that makes my hair stand on end on my arms and obviously make another part of me very excited.  We hit the couch again and this time the underwear comes off and I am ripping into the condom box and tear open the package and put the damn thing on and just as I'm about to enter her my door bell rings and we both realize that it is now 7 and my BIL & SIL are there to meet us to go out for dinner.  Yes this was pre planned and yes we both totally forgot.  \n\nI am about to scream out of frustration at this point but we both quickly put on our clothes and she is sitting on the couch laughing hysterically.  I go answer the door and they come in.  My BIL starts talking and my SIL sits down on a chair next to Stacey and they start talking, now mind you she is still giggling.  My BIL God love him is a great guy but totally oblivious to things sometimes (even when he was a kid he was like this) and he just talked the entire time to both of us.  I sat down next to Stacey and held her hand.  Then there came the moment I realize that there is a torn open box of condoms on the floor and an open condom wrapper on the footstool.  Before I could cover it up with a magazine my SIL notices it and the look of (I'm not sure what, horror maybe) on her face was something to see.  She then makes eye contact with me and we both turn three shades of red.  All the while my BIL is going on and on about something.  Stacey is again laughing hysterically.  We pile into their car and go off to dinner.  Stacey is taking great delight in tormenting me.  Every now and then she leans over and kisses my neck and start whispering things in my ear and honestly I'm about to lose it (hey its been a long long time).\n\nWe get to the restaurant and I have to go pee so I leave to go the bathroom only to find out that I am still wearing my condom.  The guy at the urinal next to me was traumatized for life.\n\nAnyway I don't think I was great dinner company as all I could think about was seeing Stacey without her clothes on.  I tried to pretend to care about conversation but not really sure I succeeded.  We then went and saw the new vacation movie and then they took us home.\n\nAfter they leave Stacey tells me that she is tired and is leaving to.  I am sure I looked like a beat puppy dog at this point and she starts laughing again telling me she is teasing me.  She walks over grabs the box off of the floor and takes my hand and leads me upstairs.\n\nWithout going into great detail let's just say I am glad I bought a box and not just one.  I woke up the next morning holding her in my arms and honestly nothing has felt this right in years.\n\nWe spent all day together on Sunday as well.  I just came out and asked her what she liked doing and much to my surprise she listed off several outdoor things, who knew?\n\nI am really starting to have very strong feelings for Stacey.  Honestly when we are apart now things don't seem right to me.\n\ntl:dr:  Arm around her during movie worked like a charm, things happen, SIL & I embarrass each other, night ended magically.",

            ">I am really starting to have very strong feelings for Stacey.  Honestly when we are apart now things don't seem right to me.\n\nCareful here. You've only never been in love or single. As a love addict myself I can tell you these feelings can get confusing and complicated. Take things slow in the feelings dept and don't be surprised if she doesn't reciprocate immediately. You can't really be sure what you feelings are because you haven't dated enough to tell the difference between infatuation with a date and love.\n\nThat being said, it isn't uncommon or wrong to have feelings either. Just be aware that they may not be what you think they are. It could something teenagers have to deal with called puppy love, or it could be real. You don't have the experience with your own emotions in the dating world to be certain of either. \n\nAs someone who has this problem with every person I date (Yes, sadly that's a thing, but thankfully not for everyone), I suggest you let her set the pace for the relationship. But don't be afraid to tell her when its too fast either. It's a balancing act that most people deal with early, but without that background all I can say is good luck and you will figure it out. Especially once the first blush of the relationship wears off.\n\nHere's hoping it's a real second chance for you. Your wife would be happy you're able to live on.",

Mostly due to lack of protection against STDs. Comparatively, hormonal birth control is 99% effective, the male condom is 98% effective, and the female condom is 95% effective. You can check all these statistics on Planned Parenthood website. So, no, you weren't \"lucky\" before... You pulled out and that's why you didn't have any accidental pregnancies! Just thought I'd clear that up in case you were worried about being infertile or something.\n\nCongrats at your happy update :)",

Our friendship seems to have gotten so much stronger and no matter what I told her, she told me our friendship was solid. I thanked her for always being there for me when I was going through rough times as I did the same for her. She told me age does not matter to her at all, she is 20 as I just flat out asked her cause I really needed to know. No boyfriend. She told me she's always felt some kind of strong connection between us, a \"weird, but good weird connection\" her words. I asked her if it was possible she had a stronger than friendship feel towards me and she said yes and I couldn't be happier. At the same time, we decided to see where this goes and whether it becomes something we both want to pursue so time will only tell. I thank everyone for their kind advice.

If you want to build a *real* friendship, you need to know the other person. Asking personal questions is okay.

Wish the best for you my fellow human. \n\nI can tell you from experience, dating the friend you have a close friendship can be one of the best feelings ever, you'll be on cloud nine. But remember, like any relationship should it be persued, it will have its ups and downs and it may or may not work. If you dive in too deep and it falls apart, you have to be prepared to lose this friendship you worked so hard for. Its sad and a hard truth to accept but that's life. \n\nIf you both talk about it and agree to go forward, by all means do so but have that talk first. Everyone always says \"oh no that will never happen to us, we can make this work\" i said the same the thing. Some people can stay friends after if it doesn't work, others are not so fortunate. Myself it was unfortunate. I lost a friend of 15 years, a friendship that was close, strong. \n\nI don't regret the beautiful memories we created, but if I could go back and keep myself from asking her out, i would. I lost love, my girl, & my best friend. Life is unfair that way. It hurt, it hurt so much more than i thought it would. \n\nI'm not saying it won't work for you two, it sure as hell can. I don't say this to scare you or keep you from doing what you feel is right but to let you know that you have to be prepared to give it all up. \n\nJust a thought. Good luck OP",

            "While it was obvious even in your last post that your roommate was insecure and out of line in controlling how you dressed, I think a lot of the comments \"blaming\" you were more or less reacting to the fact that you outright dismissed their suggestions to tell your roommate to stop bringing her boyfriend over if she had such an issue with him being around you. Rather than seeing it as a possible compromise between you and your roommate, you were unwilling to consider the idea because, in your own words: \"I don't mind him coming over because I do enjoy his company. So I'm not going to tell her he can't come over anymore.\"\n\nMost people in your situation would have told their roommate: \"Look this is my apartment. I will wear what I want in my space that I pay for. If you have an issue with that, stop bringing your boyfriend over here.  He doesn't pay rent, and therefore doesn't have the same rights as I do. You can't police my behavior in my own home, but you can stop inviting him over and allowing him to hang out, especially when you're not here.\" Instead, your response suggested you prioritized him/what he thought of you over your roommate and keeping the peace, which suggests you either *really* hate your roommate and don't want to compromise out of spite or secretly like the boyfriend's attention.  Since your roommate didn't seem nearly as bat-shit in your last post as she does in this one, people assumed your motivation was the latter of the two.\n\n ",

        "selftext": "[Original Post Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2g7rfe/my_injured_wife27f_of_3_years_just_told_me25m_to/)\n\nFirst off, let me thank all you guys for all your wishes and blessing and valuable advice. I may not have responded to each and every reply, yet I can assure that I read every single one, so thanks.\n\nThe biggest thing I took away from /r/relationships was that I need to balance her medical needs and her emotional needs. You guys were right. I was being more of a house-nurse than a husband. So, I needed to do something to fix that.\n\nYou people were right. She made the offer for me to sleep with other women because she was afraid that she\u2019s not enough. So, when she talked about it again, I resorted to an old trick of mine. I act childish. You know when little kids don\u2019t want to eat broccoli or asparagus and they just cross their hands and act petulant, well I, a 25 year old man, do that. And yes, it works. Why ? Because its a unique combination of persistence and comic effect. But in all seriousness, I first went to her and held her hand and told her a very sincere \u2018I love you\u2019 and that she\u2019s the only one for me. She insisted once more and I switched to baby mode. I crossed my hands and put on a baby voice and I told her that I will not talk to her until she stops talking about this. She said with an incredulous chuckle, \u201cAre you serious right now?\u201d. I looked away from her, and let out a childish *hmph*. I stayed there like that for 2 hours. She went from talking seriously, to angry screaming, to laughing her ass of, to silence, until she finally said, \u201cSorry. I won\u2019t bring it up again\u201d. I smiled, kissed her, then ran off to the bathroom (those 2 hours were torture). This issue was resolved. But there were more problems.\n\nMany of you may not agree with me here, before I even thought of doing anything on the physical front, I had to check with her doctors. So I talked to the doctor who first took over her case. This guy is seriously the best doctor I have ever known. Even though he behaves professionally, he is so open and friendly that I felt no problem in talking about sex. I told him plain and simple that my wife was craving intimacy and that its affecting our marriage and her emotional health. He gave me an understanding smile and then said plain and clearly what he wanted to. He reminded me that he had told me when she was in the ICU after the accident that our marriage will go through a very tough phase. And that it will test every bit of our self control but we have to, if she is to make a full recovery.\n\nThen again he told me that he agreed that something needed to be done. He said that oral sex on either side is completely, completely forbidden. If I stimulate her, her pelvis might thrust. If she stimulates me, her neck will move excessively and as as result that might put pressure on her spine. 7 months is not enough, especially not with the damage dealt to the bones in her case. What he did say is that if she is lying down, she could probably use her hands a little. But the pivot should be her elbow and not her shoulder. So, that certainly opened up some possibilities for us. Other than that, the doctor warned me very seriously that we should not try anything stupid. She\u2019ll have to live with the consequences forever.\n\nSo with this in mind, I headed home. She was reading a book, and I told her that I had talked to the doctors, and this is what they told me. She was beyond ecstatic. So, I immediately took her shirt off, got her off her bed and helped her to our excessively large futon. It has float cushions so it didn\u2019t affect her posture. I lay down on my back, and she lay down on top of me with her back on my stomach. Using a few pillows we were able to fix her head pointing towards me. A small pillow below her hips and she was comfortable. This is the position that we were able to find that worked for us. Now we just lay like this and make out for hours on end as soon as I get home, and she is able to use her hands on me. This way there is no strain on her back nor her shoulders. We switch up left/right position to make sure her neck doesn\u2019t stay bent one way for too long. Ever sine we started this, she has been extra cheerful and happy. We got back to the routine where we would have this sexting/dirty talk build up till I came home from work and though we don\u2019t have sex right now, it still helps us to feel like we\u2019re heading back to normalcy.\n\nA couple of times, while we were getting really into it, I started sucking on her breasts and started touching them. Now she has come from such stimulation before so I had to be careful as it might cause some sudden movement. So because I didn\u2019t want her to come, I had to go slowly and she felt like it was torture and she ended up feeling more frustrated because I had to let go just as she reached the brink. So, we stopped that for now.\n\nThis is again a short term solution and I know that very soon she\u2019ll want more, but I\u2019m taking small steps at this point, in what I hope is the right direction. You people were right that I was trying to contain her. But please do understand the spirit that was done in. She\u2019s my wife and I don\u2019t want to see her hurt. I want to see her walk and jump again. I don\u2019t want to see her in pain and I want all this to get over so that we can be back to normal. She keeps asking for more but instead of flat out saying No, I plead with her to wait for a little while. I ask it as a personal favour and she reluctantly obliges, which I\u2019m thankful for. She\u2019s getting better everyday and I feel like we\u2019re at a better place in our relationship now.\n\nTo those of you who are in such a situation, here\u2019s some advice : These are trying times. They\u2019ll push and pull your bond to the limits and you will feel helpless at times, and you might want to shut yourself away from it all. The tunnel might seem too long and you might not see the light yet, but just believing that there is light at the end of it all helps a lot. You need to keep that special thing about your relationship alive. How we do it, you ask ? Every night, we read our marriage vows to each other. A month ago she had been in terrible pain and the doctors had done their work and left. I felt like shit because I couldn\u2019t help her. The next day, for some reason she was extremely cranky and rude and I was frustrated. I went out of the room and slammed the door shut. I heard her crying inside and I felt terrible. I just wanted to run away from it all. Then my eye fell on the plaque that we got engraved with our vows. I picked it up and read them again and again. I realised why I had to stick through it all, why I had to wait for these 2 years, why I had to be stronger. It was simply because I loved her more than I loved myself.\n\n*In sickness and in health\u2026*\n\nShe was asleep when I entered the room that evening. I sat next to her and started reading our vows out loud. When I looked up, she was smiling at me with tears in her eyes.\n\n**tl;dr** : Went to the doctor, found a middle ground, fixing stuff.\n",

Yeah.\n\nThe BDSM community has plenty of harnesses, restraints, and equipment you could use to physically restrain her from being able to move her body during sex.\n\nWith liberally applied therapeutic pillows and cushions, you could easily get a set up that would allow you to have sex without her body being physically able to hurt itself.\n\nYou could restrain her body to the extent where even an orgasm would be unable to move her waist, back, or neck.\n \nOf course, if it's the twitching muscles that are the reason you can't do it, then forget it, but if it's because she can't swivel her hips about, then it's worth looking into.",

Although little obvious physical damage, constant severe pain and immobility was the biggest issue for us. It took us years and years to get back to anything approaching a normal sex life and we went through the \"you can sleep with other women\" thing too.  For some reason, where we live, we didn't get offered counseling for any of it so we had to tough it out.  We nearly didn't.\n\nSo, being someone that knows what it's like, I really do wish you all the best for the future.",

            "I'm sure there are not many in your situation so I felt compelled to post. I currently assist as a volunteer companion for a paraplegic of 8 years with skull fracture, scapula broken and T12 blown alone w/ several ribs. She was experiencing social isolation. We basically just watch cool movies, eat pizza, and show each other whatever is on the Internet. I've known her for 16yrs.  I assist her moving from place to place. Getting clothes, etc. shopping.\n\nRecently she has become very vocal about being horny and wanting to give BJs , and asked me several times. (Usually after drink or MJ) she also found that her sensory function in the abdomen has come back somewhat. I recently found out that an old married friend of hers comes over for oral. And their may be others.\n\nFirst of all she took quite a hit to the head, while she seem coherent she makes obvious cognitive mistakes. Second I can not imagine standing in the DA office explaining why I was feeding dick to someone I was supposed to be helping, and third I just don't want an STD. \n\nAdditionally I could not imagine how to have sex with so many broken parts, without injury, plus the fact that an accidental pregnancy would probably result in a stillborn because of all the meds. In addition she smokes (both) and drinks. I have been clean for years and recently fell off doing shots with her. (Worst hangover ever)\n\nSo I have been bailing on her, recently because I have been ill, but previously by having other commitments. I got a troublesome text saying she would give head to the first guy who brought her whiskey. Her request has put me in a tough position. I used to spend the night and we usually stay up all night. I'm not sure how to back off and not sure if I should because of her depression being alone. There you have it.",

Is a wonderful story that everyone know, but I always asked myself how they went through all this. Is nice to see the magic, but the trick behind it is was make it so special.\n\nYou, OP, just showed me the trick behind the magic. Is hard, there are fights, tears, frustration and anger. But patient, love and communication can make anything happen. This is only the begining, but little steps one after another can go a long way.\n\nI wish you the best of luck to your wife in her recovery, and I offer you my respect. You're awesome.",

It takes a lot of courage on your part to stick with it in the worst times of your relationship. You're both very strong individuals, and have inspired me to be a better man. I'm going through a divorce with a wonderful woman whom I met in high-school. The way things ended between us isn't fair for her, but we talked recently and it has been for the best. I've learned a lot from these past 10 months but what you're going through has put it in to perspective for me. There's a lot of things I need to improve on. What I need to learn, that you seem to have in abundance, is compassion. If I can be half the man you are, I think I'm doing alright. ",

Despite having a high libido, I can't always handle having sex and I'm glad that my partners have other people in their life they can enjoy that with. And so do I. \n\nI can see opening your relationship as potentially being an incredibly positive thing that would take away a great deal of pressure, guilt, and stress from your wife, and likewise you, if you both could work through the underlying issues you have over it. \n\nYou played a fun game with her to convince her to not discuss this again, and personally I don't believe that was the healthiest choice for your longevity.

            "One of my wife's exes didn't do anything bad to her by her standards, but I disagree with her assessment of certain things. His actions certainly shaped parts of her and molded her into the person she is now. Over the years I have increasingly became angry at him and wanted to beat him up. I haven't, but my point is maybe the current boyfriend sees something differently than you do. Maybe he feels the ex caused you harm.",

And trust me, if he's randomly attacking and beating up anyone he sees who has dated you, he'll be beating up anyone he thinks you may be seeing behind his back (and he WILL be sure to see them, i.e. any man you have a conversation with of one word or more), and he'll probably go on to beat you. But even if he didn't do any of that stuff, what he did to your ex is completely crazy and unforgivable. Your ex should tell the police and have him arrested for assault and battery.",

Did you give your ex any reason to show him that you're still attached to him.. were you talking to him? I'm not saying it is justifiable but some people have been brutally hurt and are just angry which makes them such people. \n\nMaybe you should ask him to go to a counselor and work on his anger before you both should consider talking again. It just depends on how much you love him.. and how you both deal with the underlying issues. If you cheated on with him I could understand why he did this. ",

            "Well, ... *did* your boyfriend beat up your ex ... and especially, was it a non-provoked attack?  Sounds like you heard about it pretty indirectly.  Did your boyfriend admit it to you?  What did he say?  How 'bout ask your ex what happened - cut through several layers of indirection and get (at least probably) much closer to the truth of what actually did/didn't happen.  How 'bout other independent credible witnesses - can you ask them what happened?\n\nSo ... presuming your boyfriend launched an unwarranted unprovoked physical attack against your ex (e.g. your ex didn't start physical fight with your boyfriend that your boyfriend \"finished\"), dump your boyfriend - immediately, hard, cold - cut him off and out of you're life.  You can simply tell him in no uncertain terms that what he did was totally unacceptable, and that (you saying to him about your relationship with your boyfriend) \"our relationship is done\".  And that's it.  Done, finito.  You *don't* want to end up in the situation where he's beating up you, or your kids or whomever, because he judged someone's behavior unacceptable or not to his liking, or because he was jealous, or whatever.  So, ... presuming you've confirmed or get confirmation that he launched unprovoked physical attack against your ex, dump your sorry \\*ss \"boyfriend\" immediately, and never look back.\n\nIf on the other hand, you want to line yourself up for becoming an abuse victim and that's your relationship objective, and you wish to help endorse and support general \\*ssholery, then by all means stay with the current boyfriend.  ;-)  Yeah, ... don't do that.\n\nP.S. - my sister spent over 20 years (and with 3 kids) in a highly abusive relationship to herself and her kids ... you do *not* want to be or end up like that (complex PTSD, numerous suicide attempts by one of the kids, ... friggin' major disaster).",
            "> I don't know if I should break up with him or try and fix things. \n\nAre you perhaps a little bit simple? Why do you even need to ask this, that's ridiculous, leave, leave yesterday, if you don't leave right now don't complain when he inevitably beats you up, this is your warning, a massive fucking siren that says \"this guy is scum\".",
            "The fact that you have to ask makes me think it was you with the issues, not your ex.",
            "(English is not my first language, sorry for the mistakes) \n\nI'm gonna be the devil's lawyer here but before breaking up with him, you should try to see what happened and why he has done that. I mean there's obviously no good reason to hit someone who didn't do anything to you, but maybe understanding why he thought he needed to do that might be interesting. \n\nI don't say you shouldn't break up with him (I think you should) but before try to make him understand that what he has done was not right and that maybe he should go and see a therapist. This guy probably has some sort of mental issue and definitely needs to see a therapist. If he's girlfriend tells him to go see a therapist he might do so. \n\nIf you just leave him he's gonna get more angry (thinking you cheated on him with your ex) and even if he doesn't do anything to you or your ex, he's gonna end up with another girl and might hit her or someone from her family/friends. So yeah, if you just break up with him without trying to help him (not being he's therapist but asking him to go to see one), you're just moving the problem (your bf's violence) to somebody else.",

The way it sounds is that there\u2019s some holes in the story and me giving him the benefit of the doubt,i don\u2019t believe he or anyone in their right mind would attack someone the way your bf attacked your ex just because he was there. I think it could be deeper than that. But if he tells you he literally beat the crap out of him just to do so then you\u2019re absolutely entitled to be angry about that. I say have a sit down calm collected conversation about it and then with the information you receive go from there with things. ",
