        "selftext": "Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/34fd9v/me_23_f_with_my_bf_21_m_of_8_months_regarding/\n\nHey all! Reddit emailed me about verifying this account, which I completely forgot even existed, so I checked it out and went back and read my post from 5 years ago. I read through the comments again, and I figured maybe it'd be worth posting an update since honestly, I have no idea how I was defending this person at the time...\n\nPretty much, I made that post about my boyfriend thinking it was \"very weird\" that I lived with my brother at a point where my boyfriend and I had been dating for a few months shy of a year. One month after I made that post, my brother ended up moving out anyway, and my boyfriend and I moved to another apartment (all planned, and just a matter of the lease ending), so the situation had mostly resolved itself.\n\nHowever, LET ME TELL YOU, holy shit, I wish I would have taken the advice given to me in the post, and I cringed reading through this 5-year-old post because a lot of the comments were so true, and I should have just left. I put up with his shit for a total of 4 years before he broke up with me (\"for good\" - we actually broke up probably 10-12 different times that lasted anywhere from a few hours to a couple of weeks). \n\nThe entire time, he was definitely jealous of my brother. Pretty much, he ended up admitting that my brother was a guy who commanded a room, people always looking to him (like, he's sort of a \"leader\" in his friend group), and making people laugh. That was the type of person my (now ex-) boyfriend wanted to be, so he hated that my brother was that. In fits of rage, even in a *completely* unrelated argument, he would randomly be like \"I bet you've fucked your brother!\" So much shit coming from him, but I think that the combination of he and I in a relationship together was just incredibly toxic and made it so hard for me to be able to think about things rationally. \n\nThere was a comment in my original post about someone wishing I could see the situation from the outside, and looking back at that post, I feel like I finally am, and it's just cringeworthy. Someone had PM'd me a list of signs of an abusive relationship, and looking back, he definitely checks off most of those. I had said that he rarely lies to me, but in retrospect, our relationship was FULL of lies - some major ones that I recall from before I made that post, so I'm not sure if I was lying to myself then or what.\n\nI'm in a much better place now, and have had a new boyfriend for about 2 years. I think the takeaway here, and why I wanted to post an update is for people perhaps in a similar situation (regardless of what it might be about) to consider. If your SO is absolutely ridiculous when it comes to something, don't expect it to be okay just because you can maybe avoid that topic in the future. It's possible that it will still come up, and it's very likely that this isn't a red flag to ignore just because it's easy to ignore. It's still a raging red flag, and has a lot of implications for your relationship in the future.\n\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: Stayed with boyfriend of < 1 year at the time for about 4 years. He was super jealous of my brother and thought living with him was very weird. Post-breakup, I finally have clarity and he was ridiculous.",

He was jealous of both his own brothers, his gf's brothers and so on. It's just fucked up. \n\nIt's all caused by feelings of paranoia, inadequacy, and anger.

There were a few thoughts that resonated that I appreciate.  Secondly, get your popcorn.  *Disgunbgood.jpg.gif*  I know we all like a good story, and this is somewhat therapeutic for me.  This all happened a few days ago and it took me a bit to digest everything. \n\nQuite a bit of advice was around direct confrontation and asking her what the heck was going on.  After numerous ignored phone calls and text messages she finally decided to pick up her phone.  She apologized and said her phone died and she didn't realize it until it was too late.  I started in right away with that she had previously sent me a message non nonchalantly that she just 'wasn't feeling it' between us.  After that message, we talked and she said she was just feeling stressed and was taking it out on me.  Understandable...stress happens.  So my next question was this: \"Your friend had told me that you were seeing someone else.  Whats going on?  Do you want to break up??\" \n\nHer answer?  \"What??? WHO SAID THAT??? oh my god.... who said that?? Oh my gosh, Im sooooo tired of all these rumors about me!   Who said that?!\"    She went on like this for quite a while.  What struck me was that she was more concerned about someone ratting her out than the accusations.   She assured me over and over that no she did not want to break up and then started making me feel awful that I would make these statements towards her.  Didn't I know how she felt about me?  That i was saying this made her feel like I didn't trust her.  I suddenly felt like the worst person in the world. She also pleaded with me to give up who it was that said this, but I wasn't budging on that.  In the end, she said she was having an emotional, stressful day and just wanted to relax and we would talk later, maybe over the weekend.  After taken in the advice from here... I felt like she was misdirecting. \n\nI sat there in a mix of feeling like something was amiss, and feeling awful that i just accused my beautiful girlfriend of cheating on me.  I felt terrible.  I sat for a bit, feeling like I just put this huge crack in our relationship.  I love her to pieces.  I needed to go apologize.  \n\nI hopped in my car and drove the hour to her city and decided to get her a quart of her favorite chocolate ice cream on my way there.  When I stopped into the shop to pick up this treat, I run right smack into her daughter hanging out with her boyfriend.  They are both in college, doing night classes and just got out of school and wanted a treat.   We were chit chatting and she was going to be staying at her bf for the night, but forgot one of her workbooks and needed to stop at the house real quick to pick it up.\n\nAfter chatting, the daughters bf took off and we both drove up to my GF house.  I pulled into the street because they have assigned parking at her unit.  Her daughter actually pulled up behind me instead of her own spot and when we got out I said, \"whats up, neighbor took your spot again?\" as we walked up to the door. \n\n\"No.... thats not my neighbors car...\" \n\nI don't know if it was the way she said it or her sigh afterwards or what but suddenly it felt like my heart just sank.  I KNEW what we were going to find, but I was hoping for anything but that. \n\nHer daughter and I both shuffled through the door and stopped immediately in the entryway.  We could just hear them.  There's no mistaking it.  You know the sound:  rhythmic thumping and moaning with little exclamations of pleasure.  The bedroom was right across from us.  \n\nHer daughter looked at me with her eyes as big as saucers and just goes 'oh my god....im sooooooo sorry'.   At this moment it felt like i was living outside my body. Its hard to explain but suddenly it was like i was just a person watching actions happen. I couldn't really feel anything and  I didn't know what to do.  Here i am...standing here...with a quart of ice cream while my GF is getting railed in her bedroom.  I had no idea how to proceed. My whole body just felt like i couldn't control it. \n\nHer daughter suddenly just screams 'MOM! WHAT THE FUCK!' that sounded like a cross between a banshee wail and an firetruck siren.  \n\nMy GF actually ran out of the bedroom, naked and all, possibly thinking there was some emergency.  Maybe motherly instincts that something bad just happened.  I don't know.  She started to formulate words but fell silent as soon as she saw the too of us standing there. \n\nEventually a stream of words fell out of her mouth: \"oh my god. What are you doing here?  You're not supposed to be here.  what are you doing here?\"  She kept repeating it over and over until she ran back into the bedroom.  \n\nI still stood there. shocked.  Still having an out of body experience. I don't know how much time passed. seconds or hours.  It blurs.   She came out clothed in her pajamas and was talking to whoever it was on the other side of the bedroom door.  My GF (EX now) started yelling at her daughter and I about why we were in the house.  I think the realization of everything was suddenly starting to hit her because she started crying and making unintelligible noises.  Her daughter starts to scream at her about 'how could you do this??' and 'you did it AGAIN?'   \n\nAt this point...I had seen enough.  I couldn't even look at her anymore. Everything was numb and my ears felt like they were ringing. My body still wasn't my own.   I walked over to her kitchen table and put down the ice cream saying, 'I know you get hungry after sex....so heres some ice cream.'  and walked out the door.   She started sobbing 'Nooo' but it I just kept walking and drove home.   That was a few days ago. \n\nI didn't go to work the next day.  \n\nMy phone has been BLOWN up. I have not replied.   For your reading pleasure here are some of my favorite messages:\n\n\"If we had spent more time together it wouldn't have happened.\"\n\n\"It doesn't mean anything.  You know that I love you\"\n\n\"If you cared anything about us or our relationship you would talk to me.\"\n\n\"Are you ignoring me?\"\n\n\"Please\" I have lots of 'please's.  \n\n\"if you cared, we would be able to work this out\" \n\nIt goes on and on.  \n\nRight now I still feel kinda numb.  I just don't understand how or why this happened.  I gave this girl and her family so much and my all and it didn't even matter.  I provided for them when times were tough and did so much to make our lives good.  I know I shouldn't feel this way, but I feel like I don't mean anything or that I can't make someone happy now. It's frustrating.  I know Ill get over it in time but it definitely hurts. I don't understand why or how this could happen. We were soooo good too.  So many questions I want to ask her, but Im forcing myself to NOT have contact with her and just going to move on. \n\nIn retrospect I wish I kept the ice cream. \n\n**tl;dr**: GF caught having sex.  She got rewarded with Ice cream. ",

Things were great, the sex was awesome, and we were in love.\n\nCut to a year down the road. I discover that she cheated on me and confronted her about it. She cried and did the same song and dance that your ex is trying, and I unfortunately took the bait. Was I naive? Absolutely. She seemed sincere, and I was a fucking moron. What can I say? Not enough blood to run the big and little brains simultaneously.\n\nNow here comes the unfortunate part (which others have alluded to in other comments here). Once you forgive, it's like giving your SO a golden ticket to bang anything that walks. I forgave my GF and believe everything she said about how \"she loves me\" and \"they mean nothing\", which led to her cheating on me with a cool half-dozen other guys. (Yep, I was a fucking moron)\n\nOnce I found out she was back at it, I regretted being such a dipshit in the first place when I forgave her. I ended things immediately and never looked back again, learning a tough lesson in the process.\n\nI don't know if the love I had for her is on the same level of your love for your Ex, but I gotta say man - just walk away. Never look back. Nothing good is going to come from it. Fuck, even her daughter recognizes the pattern.\n\nIt's not you, man. It's her. She's the one with issues, and she's not going to fix them at 42. Don't let your own doubts lead you back to her, because that's only going to crush your soul WHEN it happens again.

This isn't about something that happened or me thinking people are bad or other crazy thoughts, I just could never fit with people. I never had friends, but never felt like I needed them either. I think I might be somewhere in the autism spectrum but I don't have an official diagnosis. I'm cool and fine on my own.\n\nI grew up in NYC and finally decided that the environment there is no good for me. I decided to move to a different state, buy some cheap land in a very small village and built a house for myself. The only people I interact with in person on a daily basis are the people at the market where I buy stuff and when something is delivered to me. To be honest, it's the best decision I've ever made. I'm much happier and more comfortable.\n\nI have a lot of online friends. I'm a software engineer and make apps and games. I can work from the comfort of my own home and the living costs are so low that I have no stress about money. I've already made enough to last me 30 more years of living like this.\n\nNow my family are the only people that I have some sort of emotional connection with. I have a more or less good relationship with all of them especially my younger sister who visits me quite often. The thing is, they all say they miss me. They want me to come back living in NYC, they say I should get out of my solitary life and start a family for myself. I can't do those things. And my parents are calling me selfish for not even trying.\n\nI feel really bad when they're upset at me, it feels like everyone I know is upset so I must have done something wrong. I'm not good at communicating these feelings. I think they thinks I'm sad because I'm lonely but I'm not. It's by choice. \n\nFirst, do you think I'm selfish? I know they want what's best for me I just don't think they know what is best for me. And second, is it selfish of me to not give things another try in NYC?\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: I choose to live alone away from cities. My family want me to work harder to fit in.",

            "My uncle did this, moved into the wild of BC about 30 years ago. It was the best thing he ever did for himself. Sure it's weird for our family at first, because it's far from the norm and really far away from family (Ontario).They got used to it. He just belongs there. My brother [22M] seems to be the same way, we often send him up there for a few months at a time, I also think my brother may be on the autism spectrum as well. It keeps him calm and makes him really ambitious and productive when he goes up there. I sometimes encourage him to stay longer because when he comes back he seems so refreshed, healthy and put together, I feel like that's when I see my brother at his best. Then the longer he spends with more people here in the city, the more depressed I see him get. I' fairly sure I'm accepting of his life this way, but my parents as well are still stuck on him living a \"normal\" life, but that just doesn't suit everyone! Just sometimes that takes people longer than other's to realize. I think solitude for some people is honestly the best possible solution. Just make sure to take advantage of opportunities to see your family, it's good for you (in my brother's case, good in small doses). \n\nThey'll adjust. Just stand firm that this is what you want to do, and where you want to live and that you're happy and hope they can accept that, be persistent, hopefully in time they'll get a better understanding.

            "My late mother was a die-hard New Yorker.  Though I grew up mostly in DC, because my parents had way too much interaction with both of their families, and rules for visiting were constantly being blown through.  But in her heart, my Mom loved New York, deeply.\n\nBut she was the first one to say that NYC has so...many...people.  And the only way you can really enjoy living in NYC is if you can afford to make a buffer for yourself.   Otherwise, it just gets to be overwhelming sometimes, even for a native like her.\n\nYour family is probably part annoyed that you aren't close - my husband and I are in the Twin Cities, and my NYC-born father CONSTANTLY bitches about how far away we are, even though he admits he really likes where we live - and a little bit jealous you broke the mold and found a nice, quiet, affordable lifestyle.  There's also probably a dash of that John Updike quote: \"The true New Yorker secretly believes that people living anywhere else have to be, in some sense, kidding.\"\n\nYou are not being selfish.  You are self-aware and know what will keep you level.  You don't sound like you're a total hermit - your family visits, you do go out to market instead of having everything delivered - and you know your own limitations on interaction.  There's nothing wrong with that - in fact, there's a lot there that's right.\n\nJust tell your family you're happy where you are, because it's right for you.  It's not about them, it's about what works for you.  I love NYC myself (I'm Brooklyn-born, so it's in my DNA), but man, I can't imagine living there now.  The expense alone just doesn't seem worth it - there are places to live that are pleasant that aren't NYC.",
            "At the end of the day, it is your life. It is you who will have to look at yourself in the mirror and it is you who will be with your thoughts when lying in bed waiting for sleep to come. So, you have to do what makes you comfortable. It is perfectly understandable that your family would want you to get married and have children because from their experience, that is what made them happy. A lot of times, we want other people to do what made us happy and have a hard time understanding how other people doing what would not make us happy, could possibly make them happy. I suspect that this is where your family is right now. They don't understand you.\n\nI can tell you from experience that there is nothing worse than changing yourself so much, to fit into the expectations of another person, to the point where you become a stranger to yourself. There is nothing more confusing and more disorientating than thinking you need to fulfill another person's idea of you so you can be accepted to the point where you cannot accept yourself anymore. There is nothing more draining than giving away pieces of yourself, till you are just a shell of a person. \n\nAnd worse still, after losing so much of yourself, you need to go back to finding yourself, which is another journey in itself. If you are where you are and are comfortable with yourself, then you are better off than a lot of who are living up to society's expectations.",
            "Do you ever visit them, or do they do all the travel? Just asking because that's the only potential selfish aspect of the situation I can see from your post.",
            "If you had a couple of horses and a couple of dogs, I would want your life. Good for you.",
            "I understand that your family misses you. I also understand that it's difficult for most people to wrap their heads around the fact that not everyone needs to get married and reproduce to have fulfilling lives. \n\nYou have to do what makes YOU happy. Sometimes this includes reducing the amount of contact with your family to a minimum because it's making you unhappy. \n\nYou know what makes you happy and you went and got it. Why doubt yourself now when the only issue with it all is the opinions being forced on you?",
            "So, first of all, living life on your own terms is never selfish.  The big decisions like where and how to live, if you're not relying on others to do it or making them do it with you, that's no one's business but yours.  Continue living where you love to live guilt free.\n\nBut one thing that I notice you saying is that your sister visits often, but not that *you* visit *them* often.  When you have an emotional connection with people, and you care about that relationship, you do need to put in work to keep it up.  As an introverted person myself, I notice that often the ideal amount of time that I want to spend with my loved ones is less than the ideal amount of time they want to spend with me.  It's easy to get into a pattern where people keep coming to visit me, but I never go to visit them.  And it's not because I don't want to see them, but it's because they feel like they want to see me sooner than I start thinking \"Oh hey I haven't seen so-and-so in a while.  Maybe I should go see them.\"\n\nIf you care about your relationship with your family, you don't need to go move back to a life you don't like to make them happy.  But you should try to realize that they're expressing to you that they miss you and they want to spend more time with you.  Is there any way that you could make more of an effort to socialize with them?  To visit them more often maybe?  Or schedule trips together?\n\nIt's also possible that that's not what this is.  They miss you, but more that they're worried that you're not living a happy life because you're so frequently alone.  They're projecting their values at you, and trying to guilt you into moving back because they think that's best for you, or they want you to live a life that they think you should live.\n\nI think that it's important to find a way to interact with them on your terms, but caring for their needs, and building a relationship with them that you're happy with.  It might mean going to visit them more often than you otherwise would want to, but then firmly saying \"I'm really happy living in *location!*\" and  changing the subject whenever they try to ask you to move back somewhere you don't want to go.",
            "Living in a quiet village is not exactly living in the woods as an isolated hermit.  \n\nThey may never come around, and maybe it comes from a place of genuine concern because they just can't wrap their heads around your choice.  When it comes up, let them know that you are happy and quickly shut down the conversation every time.  There's not much else you can do, tbh.  Meddlers gonna meddle.  ",
            "They care about you. However, they are saying these things because there is a common perception of a 'good life' that has been drilled into their heads since childhood. Job, Money, House, Marriage, Kids etc.\n\nOften we fail to question our beliefs because they are comfortable, and invisible. And we think that those who deviate from the standard are wrong, or in pain, or suffering, and we want to convince them to change and come back to 'the good life'.\n\nYou aren't suffering, or delusional, or lonely. You're happy, and are leading a fulfilling life. Not all of us gain  happiness and satisfaction from the same path, the same things.\n\nExplain to your family that you were deeply unhappy before in NYC, and now you've found happiness and peace. To go back would make you unhappy again, and they wouldn't want that.\n\nIt's not selfish to to choose to live a life that makes you happy. Yes, they feel that they need you around, want to look at you, talk to you, but asking you to move so they can fulfill their wishes at the cost of your happiness is them being selfish, not you.",
            "Fellow introvert here.  Do what makes you happy :). Sounds to me like you've done absolutely nothing wrong",

            "How did you set up the life you live? This is something I'm very interested in doing ",
            "If they were worrying you have mental health issues I might agree, in the sense that I would be worried about anyone I know who decided to become a modern hermit. You have good reasons but it's one of those situations where it is impossible to convince others that it is the right one.\n\nBut that's not what they're saying, they are saying it is inconvenient for them that you don't live nearby. That they want someone to hang around with, to go out with, to have grandkids/niblings they can coddle.\n\nOrder your thoughts and send them an email. Give them the facts: You hate crowded and busy places. You moved away from NYC to get away from that. You love your life here. You live cheaply and healthily in beautiful country and get all the socialising you need online and with them. You're never moving back so stop asking. A family is not something you ever wanted so don't expect a wife or grand kids from you. You're happier here than you've ever been so please stop calling your decisions elfish. It's more selfish you want me to be unhappy. Please stop talking about it.\n\n>First, do you think I'm selfish? I know they want what's best for me I just don't think they know what is best for me. And second, is it selfish of me to not give things another try in NYC?\n\nNo\n\nFirst off, kids moving away from their hometown is standard in modern America. Most people seem to move at least several hours away so even if you were an epic level socialiser you'd probably still live somewhere that would make visiting inconvenient.\n\nSecond you're not going out of contact. By the sounds of it you are on the computer most of the day so they can message you any time. You also don't object to them visiting either I assume?\n\nThird, making you live in NYC would make you miserable but would only make them a little more happy. They miss you, but they don't spend all day in bed crying that you are gone. Even if they did, it'd be their job to get over it. It'd be a small benefit for them compared to a massive loss for you.\n\nFourth there's nothing you being in NYC provides that is vital to them are irreplaceable. They're not sick and need you to care for them. They're not kids who need you to look after them. They're adults and can find their own entertainments.\n\nAs for another try you are 33 years old. I think you figured out this is what you want by now.",

            "I'm a bit jealous of you. Most people have an innate desire to have social contact, even if they're cynical.  \n\nMaybe you're selfish. But even so, so what? We're all selfish to an extent. You know what's best for you so you do what's best for you. There's nothing wrong with that as long as it isn't harming other people. Maybe, but you don't have to give things another try in NYC. If you're fine alone and that's how you are, you don't need to change to fit what other people's standards of how humans should behave.",
            "Damn I am jealous. I really want to move to a small town with a good chunk of land and a dog. Not too far out into the woods or anything, but far enough that I don't have to interact with anyone I don't want to.",
            "just a thought: you might actually qualify for what DSM used to call \"schizoid personality disorder\". DSM is the american psychiatric manual. This was used to refer to people who aren't close to others, don't have a need to, and are only close to first degree relatives; among other things of course. Check it on wikipedia. In the recent version of the DSM, schizoid was removed as a distinct personality disorder because it's not that well validated [source on this: medscape], and because it was so controversial. The relevance to you is: it was controversial because people with schizoid aren't suffering, aren't a danger, aren't dysfunctional, etc. They're just different, they deal with things differently, perceive differently, and so on. There is no need to label them as having a disorder and send to treatment when there's nothing actually wrong. So that's a thought with regard to your case and your family's attitude. Good luck! ",

            "My Uncle Joe did what you did, but back in the 50s.  He bought a ton of land up in the mountains and lived there, mostly by himself, for the rest of his life.  He spent ten years digging a pond and building a dam to have water generate his electricity.  He lived in a giant barn and slept in a trailer.  He had a wood burning stove.  He went into town once in a while to get food, but that was about it.  He loved it and was super happy.  \n\nHe was like my dad's dad to him and we were the only ones who ever visited him and we did so often.  Everyone else thought he was crazy, but we loved him and we loved going to see him.  Once in a while, he would come to our house, but it was painfully obvious even when I was a little kid that that sort of living just wasn't for him.  No big deal.  We just went to see him instead.  Some of my best memories of being a kid were spent at Uncle Joe's.\n\nWhen he died, he left all of his property and all of his land to my dad because he was the only one who gave a crap when he was alive.  (Oh, you can bet every other relative out there came out when he was dead and pitched a fit that they didn't get anything.  My dad spent years in court fighting these idiots and finally won.)  \n\nI hope that your family comes around and realizes that you're happy and happier the way that you're living and tries to connect with you rather than change your mind.  I definitely don't think that you're selfish.  In fact, I totally get it.",
            "You are selfish for living a life you prefer? If you enjoy your life, you have nothing to change. It's your life to live how ever you see fit. NYC is a beast of a city that isn't for everyone. Hell most cities provide a lifestyle that isn't suited for everyone. Keep doing what your doing. As long as you're happy, eventually people will realize they are being selfish for wanting you to change to accommodate their lives.",
            "I agree w/majority here that you aren't selfish, if you are happy then they can visit you if they miss you.\n\nIt's awesome/refreshing to see someone living a happy life and not always struggling to move up.  Kudos to you sir.",

            "Is it selfish to be happy?  I suppose it is if you debate everything that goes along with what makes a particular person happy.  *But selfish doesn't automatically mean bad*  By that logic, anyone following their dreams is selfish.\n\nSome people go their whole life striving for happiness.  It's the ultimate dream for everyone.  You've found it.\n\nOf course I'd miss my brother if he chased a lifestyle that ultimately led him far away from me.  But I'd also be envious and proud of him as well.\n\nI see where your family is coming from but I don't think they grasp where *you're* coming from at all.  They may be happy with their lives in NY and miss you, and want grandbabies, but doesn't that ultimately make them selfish as well to ask you to sacrifice your happiness for theirs?\n\nThey must not grasp the appeal of your lifestyle which makes it hard to respect.  I think they see it as one would their adventurous child running off to travel the world backpacking and eventually it'll be time for you to satisfy that phase and come home, marry, make babies, and live \"sensibly\"\n\nIt's not for you.  I envy you that you've found your spot in the world and you should never give it up.  In fact for you to give it up for a woman and family somewhere that would make you miserable I think *that* would be much more unfair to that hypothetical family.\n\nI don't think you'll ever get your family to truly understand you but calmly, without an ounce of frustration, responding that you are truly happy with the life you've made for yourself is all that they should need to hear and you don't owe them anything more than that, especially if they don't strive to understand or respect your stance in return.  They don't have to like it.  They don't have to understand it.  It's not their life and that's ok.",
            "You just keep being you. Livin' the dream, you are.\n\nThis is how future conversations should go:\n\nThem: \"You should start a family!\"\n\nYou: \"Uh huh, ok. I'll do it tomorrow.\"\n\nThem: \"Listen to me... blah blah you have to be something you're not because or else the world is going to explode and it makes me feel bad!\"\n\nYou: \"Oh, ok. Are you done?\"\n\nThem: \"You're selfish!\"\n\nYou: \"Telling people how to live their life is selfish.\"\n\nThem: \"But blah blah blah\"\n\nYou: ::Hang up the phone:: / ::Leave::\n\nThey are disrespecting you, grow a spine. Maybe sending an article or two their way about Sensory Processing Disorder might help them understand but maybe not.\n\nNew York City is *awful* in many ways. It's an amazing city, but it's awful too. You couldn't find a worse place for someone like you to live unless you went to China or something.",
            "Youe life sounds very appealing to me. I would live a similar lifestyle if I could.",

            "Most of these posts are right (you should stay the course and do what makes you happy) but are missing when it comes to dealing with your family.\n\nYour family is concerned about your lifestyle. It's different from what is \"normal\", and that makes people concerned that you aren't really happy. Imagine if, your sister decided to gain a ton of weight. Like, 600 pounds. That's the thing that would make her happy in life. And then she starts doing it. Now, your parents, her friends, and you would probably be concerned. That doesn't necessarily make someone selfish or a narcissist. I think the big fear a parent has is, after dying, from the afterlife they see their children with an omniscient presence and see that their children hate their lives and regret their decisions. (Gaining a ton of weight is not the same as living on the outskirts of society, it was just the first type of comparison that came to mind.)\n\nYour parents sound like the type of people whose concern comes from care for your well-being, as opposed to malice. But that doesn't mean you are making the wrong choice. You're an adult, and have enough life experience to make a decision like this. You are living life on your own terms, and if that makes you happy, go for it.\n\nIf you feel like you're a good writer, I recommend writing them a long letter. Understand where they are coming from, but tell them that this makes you happy. You love your job, you have online friends, you love your house, let them know these things. It sounds like you enjoy when your family visits, maybe take the impetus to visit them sometimes (that's the only thing I would say is slightly selfish, if my friend always makes me go to his house and never comes to my house that would upset me.)\n\nYou can end your relationship with your parents if you want to, but it sounds like you don't want that, and it doesn't even seem necessary right now. Give them a chance to understand.",
            "Sounds to me like your living the life. Any tips on how I can do the same?",
            "I want to be like you. I think what you did is pretty awesome. Do you mind sharing how you did this?",
            "Your parents are being selfish by asking you to come back.\n\nIf you are happy and comfortable with your living arrangement you should not change it to make other people happy. \n\nI also don't particularly enjoy the company of other people. I work from home mostly, and really dislike any days I have to go into the office and see people. I find it exhausting. \n\nI don't particularly have many friends - as quite frankly I don't enjoy doing the things people my age do. I live with my partner and my dog. I enjoy going for walks and going about my daily business in peace. \n\nThat's just me. My sister is the polar opposite and ensures that her days off work are booked solid of seeing people and doing things. I couldn't think of anything worse! I go to breakfast with my mom and step dad once a month.\n\nAnyway, i'm rambling - continue doing what you are doing. As long as you're happy there is no need to change!",
            "You are not at all selfish.  Your parents are asking you to value THEIR happiness at the cost of you being miserable- and if that's not selfish and entitled, I don't know what is.\n\nMy experience has been that people who love being around people, or who love having a family etc., are often fundamentally incapable of grasping that anyone could be truly happy without these things.  Your parents may fall into that category.\n\nYou can't change their minds.  But you can end the conversation.\n\nThe next time it comes up, have a statement prepared.  Tell them, \"Mom, Dad, I am happy living this way.  I have plenty of friends online, and being away from the bustle of the city has done wonders for my well-being.  If I want a family one day, I am capable of making that decision and taking action on my own.  I know you are concerned for me, but I have explained this many times, and I'm sick of discussing it.  The topic is closed.\"\n\nWhen they bring it up again, gently remind them that this topic is no longer up for discussion.  If they persist, change the subject, hang up the phone, or leave the room.  Refuse to engage.\n\nIt'll upset people, but they will eventually get used to the new status quo.  It beats being hounded about this for years to come.  And you should remind yourself that THEY are why they are upset- you are simply defending your right to choose your own path in life.  Their inability to accept that is what creates the friction, not your choices themselves.\n\nPS- your life sounds amazing.  If I could work from home full-time, I definitely would.  Otherwise we sound very much alike in our preferences.",
            "Honestly this is super common. And the funny thing is it IS selfish, but of them, not you. \n\nTHEY are being selfish. They have plans for your life like you aren't a person who is of state of mind to make your own decisions. But you are. You have your own desires, feelings, dreams, hopes, goals, comfort levels, etc. \n\nYou are happy. You feel like your life is your own. And if is playing out in a way that makes you feel good. So you did it. BUT it goes against their idea of happy. \n\nThe only thing you can do is to tell them no, mean it, and stick with it. \n\nA lot of people have to do this with their families. I did. My SO did. My friends often do. \n\nIf you go against traditions at all you become a victim of it. Because they can't understand it they thing it is wrong. They would be telling you the same thing if you were gay and wanted to marry a man. It goes against their vision of how your life \"should\" play out and they try to emotionally manipulate you into changing into the person they want you to be. \n\nIgnore them. ",

They may also be thinking about grandkids.  They love you and don't want you to wake up at age 50 with regrets.  That said, romantic relationships can be utter bullshit and if you're happy by yourself, then by all means be happy!

You never felt comfortable there but now you've found a place you love. Make it clear that you appreciate their concerns because it is a sign of their affections but you won't be coming back.

They are calling you selfish because they are trying to manipulate you and that is a great way to do it because most people hate to think they are being selfish. \n\nI'm also a little uneasy about the we miss you pleas because it sounds like you talk regularly and your sister visits a lot. I guess they maybe miss having experiences with you, but it's more likely they miss the ease of having you nearby which I don't feel is your problem. \n\nFurthermore, anything after you've said no three times moves into harassment.

If you feel happy where you are, that is what matters. \n\nGood for you for taking the reins in your life and deciding where and what you want to do.

Of course he might be putting up a facade but during family meetings he always seems the most energetic, not weary of life at all. I don't think everyone in the family looks at him favorably but he's a good person with a big heart (always helping people) and he's chosen a life of quiet reflection which I respect. I think it actually takes guts to go against what is expected of you and it's not the \"easy way\" at all.\n\n\nI don't think you're selfish. You're who you are and whatever makes you comfortable and happy in this life without harming others should be what guides you. However, they are selfish if they want you to give up your happiness just so they can feel like they have a \"normal\" son.

            "I do not think you are selfish, and I think you're right, they want what is best for you, *they just aren't right about what is best for you.* To me it sounds like your family is coming at this from a place of love and concern...but as others have said, they are wrong. If you are happy with your life of semi-seclusion, then there isn't a compelling reason to move back to a city of over 8 million people.\n\nI think your best bet is to find out what their motivation is and then address those reasons as best you can by having a direct conversation about this issue with your parents (I assume most of the pressure is coming from them).\n\n>my parents are calling me selfish for not even trying.\n\nI think you should counter that it feels selfish to you that others want you to conform to what they think a \"normal\" life is, even though it isn't the kind of life you want or enjoy. Reiterate that you chose the kind of life you are currently living because you thought it would make you happy - and it has. Can they tell you *why* they think you should be living a different life? It sounds like it isn't simply that your life isn't \"normal\" and they think it should be. They said they miss you. Are there things you can do to help them feel more connected to you *that are still within your comfort zone?* If you are willing to \"compromise\" with them to become more connected you should think about what you are and are not willing to do ahead of time.\n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\n\n* Social media: do you have a social media account such as Facebook that you (actually) use to stay connected? If not, would you feel comfortable doing so? I'm not talking daily selfies with your lattes, but maybe every once in a while post about how awesome your tomato harvest was or \"wow, that was a crazy snowstorm\" and also use it to \"like\" the crap your family posts. You can use the facebook chat feature to have conversations with family members.\n\n* You say you have lots of online friends. You have to be connecting with your friends over something - do any of your family members also have an interest in those things? For example, if you play a particular online game, do any of your other family members also play or could you could get them interested? I think it could even work if the person you got to join you wasn't one of the people bugging you about being too far away, such as a niece or nephew.\n\n* Do you go back to NYC to visit family? What if you had scheduled visits? Twice a year you return home for a week or a long weekend or whatever (Christmas and some other time, maybe?) Having the visits scheduled in advance might help your parents feel better.\n\n* Family trips: if your family has a habit of going on vacations together, do you ever join them? Could you?\n\n* You said one of your sisters comes to visit a bunch. I know you like seclusion you obviously don't want to turn your place into the family hotel or vacation spot, but perhaps others are waiting for an invitation to go visit.\n\n* Piggy-backing on the above - if you were willing to have family come visit more often but the idea of everyone all up in your space feels overwhelming, could you make an addition of a guest room onto your house? It sounds like you have the land and the means to do so.\n\n* The very last suggestion I have is the most extreme, but I'm going to throw it out there anyway: would you be willing to live closer to your family? I'm not talking about finding a house in the NYC suburbs, but is there a place that you could move to that would make things easier to bridge the physical distance? For example, a place that still meets your specifications for being rural, being in the climate you prefer, etc... but is perhaps closer to an airport so they can easily visit? Or even moving geographically closer so they can more easily drive to you? I understand that is a very extreme compromise that would require you to uproot the life you are very satisfied with and could also be expensive, but it was a thought.\n\n\nI'm not suggesting you do all or even most of the above, I think that would be too much and would make you unhappy. But if you would feel comfortable with any of the suggestions you might want to offer those up as a \"compromise.\"",

You are happier living where you are and I think that you'll make yourself miserable moving back to NYC. People here like to say \"don't light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm,\" and that applies in this circumstance. Be polite, but firm with your parents. \n  \nThat being said, perhaps you could compromise a bit more by making a few more trips back to NYC. It sounds like they really love you and do miss you. Maybe you could plan to stay out in New York for a week or so every few months, or come up for a weekend once a month to see your family.

            "There's nothing wrong with you or your choice to live your life the way that is right for you. It would be a different story if you were unhappy living away from people. I understand living away from people. I live away from people, but ive always been happy alone. Ive never felt the need to be with people or have an SO. So, since I don't have that need, the only people that I keep in my life are people who I fit with. I have a low tolerance for peoples inane bs. I can get along with anyone and am outgoing but I'd rather have quality socializing than quantity. Something I try to explain to my doctor(I'm bipolar and do counseling with him) is that when I have my head on straight I feel incredibly socialized just from working outside with my hands around my dogs, cats, chickens, the outdoors. Spending time with a bunch of people won't make me feel more socialized. It can wear me out and then my next day is wasted. When my head is out of whack, socializing definitely doesn't make me feel better. I could be in a room of people I get along great with and I won't be connected with anyone, I'll feel lonely, that's a waste. If I go work outdoors though I can feel connected. Anyways, I'm rambling but when you don't fit the social 'norm' ,and you have no problem with that, it won't make you a bit happy to force yourself to fit it. That's other peoples expectations and they have nothing to do with your happiness, even if they mean well. People don't often understand thought processes different from their own or what is 'polite' ,and it makes them uncomfortable. It's selfish for others to impose their guidelines on another person.  It's just a way for people to validate their choices. I don't mean to say that your family is purposely doing that. It just happens to be a common cycle of behavior in society that happens all the time. People equate being alone to be lonely. They are totally different concepts.

If you cross that path, you could find someone very similar, who wants seclusion and to live outside of social norms; kids or no kids, doesn't \nmatter. But I worry your family would wonder what's wrong still. They would want access and not understand. You need to let them know this is by choice. ",
            "As a person who tends to thrive in social environments, I can understand why you would want isolation. There are many dynamics to social interaction which I can understand the urge to be away from.\n\nIt may be autism on your end, but that's irrelevant if you're happy. It sounds like you've had plenty of time to learn skills that make you a strong and reliable person. Building a house, software engineering and whatever else you do are both lucrative opportunities, so I can understand your family wanting you to have kids. You sound like you could support them financially.\n\nThat aside, more often the not, even capable people are unable to utilize their skills because they are miserable in life. That's something that stems from people who aren't capable or interested in family life having kids.\nIt may well be a very unselfish thing to not have a family if you aren't interested. \nFamily life is pushed on people from a young age socially despite the fact that the world is overpopulated and filled with leechers anyway. There's nothing selfish about not wanting to add water to an overflowing pot.\n\nHaving said that,  I'm not here to defend you from your family. I'm merely pointing out the fact that if you're happy, you have no reason to allow others to inflict their misery on you, which is what they're doing whether they mean to or not. Most parents don't seem to understand this, but when they want their children to live a specific style of life, they are projecting their wants onto those kids. A good parent would allow their kid to grow in their own direction and help when necessary instead of trying to direct their life, though often that's not what happens. \n\nDon't let them get to you. It's your life, do what makes you happy and understand that even if they don't like it, they aren't the ones who will have to live with the decisions they want you to make, you are. It's simple really. Just keep yourself as your priority.\nIf I were you I'd get them to explain why you not having kids is selfish in their minds and see what they say. Chances are they haven't considered it. That, or they want grandkids or something. But I mean, that would be pretty selfish of them, huh? Haha.",

To be happy, they need friends, family, a spouse, children.\n * There are people that live solitary lives by necessity.

But it won't be easy, because people in the second claim to be in the third, often even unaware of it themselves (i.e., they live solitary lives because they've given up, but if they did get a chance at a social life, they'd be much happier).",

But I definitely understand where you're coming from: I work from home as a developer and it has dramatically increased my happiness. But before that I was so depressed, so I did a lot of research on the subject, and here is what I know:\n\nSometimes it's hard for people to understand the desire to be alone. They might think there's something wrong with you and that you need help, even though you've actually found a way to be comfortable and live life. The avoidance of socialization (sometimes called \"asociality\") is usually associated with a few psychological disorders, but not always. Autism is one of them... but that does not mean that you are \"broken\" or \"wrong\" even if you are autistic. The important part is whether or not you have anxiety/fear; anxiety indicates a disorder that might need treatment. But there are some rare people who just don't want or need much interaction with others. Educating your family a little on asociality could help a lot!\n\nOn the other hand, the \"selfish\" statement implies some cultural beliefs about family... Are you the only boy (or worse: the only child)? Do your parents feel you have a duty to continue the family line? That can complicate things with your family, and there is no easy way to deal with that. You will either have to take a few chances on things you might not like, or lay down the law and tell your family that it's not going to happen. Try to be gentle... if your parents are expecting grandchildren it will not be easy on them. Do your best, even though the pressure and tears from them are probably part of the reason you did what you did in the first place. Try to remember that it's very hard for others to understand you because you are so different from them.\n\nIf you need to talk about this let me know. Like I said, I'm not in as deep as you, but maybe that's not necessarily a bad thing: I know how to cross the line into the world of extroverts and come back alive!",

            "I don't know if selfish is the right word to describe your parents, but \"unreasonable\" definitely is.  It is unreasonable to expect someone who prefers solitude to move to NYC, of all places. And it is unreasonable to expect someone who is well-settled and happy to pick up and move to another place for no other reason than to keep other people company.  \n\nI don't live in the perfect solitude that you do, but I am very socially isolated.  I have no SO, no children, no close friends.  And while I stay in contact with family through texts and emails, I live far away from them physically and emotionally--which is how I prefer it.  If I lived closer, I know I'd be constantly turning down invitations to parties and \"hanging out\".  I love my family, but only from afar and in small superficial doses.\n\nI think they finally get it, but I know it makes me the black sheep in the family. \n\nBut over the past few years, I have tried to be less mysterious because I realized that my aloofness was pissing them off.  When I get a text or email or voicemail, I try to respond quickly and not leave people hanging.   I make an effort to fly down for someone's milestone birthday or graduation party.  I have gotten a tiny bit better with opening my doors to traveling family, as long as they give me ample notice.  I do what I can, in other words, so that I don't feel so guilty when I must say \"No.\"  \n\nIf my parents tried to guilt me into moving back to my hometown because they missed me, I'd make it very clear to them that it wasn't going to happen.

            "You've decided to live a different life than your family. You've chosen a lifestyle they don't understand, especially when dealing with new yorkers. I am from St. Lawrence county. I don't know if you've been up that way ever, but it's quite isolated and probably not too far from where you're living as far as a type of lifestyle is concerned. I have quite a few friends in nyc and my fianc\u00e9e is a new yorker, what I've found after meeting a bunch of new yorkers, epsecially if they were born there and never left; have a really difficult time understanding why someone would want to live anywhere else. I've told plenty of folks from nyc i prefer more rural places and I've gotten looks that border on disgust. A lot of them just don't get why people like to live away from major cities and huge populations.\n\nUnlike you, i consider myself a people person, but i also need my space. I am the type of person who will talk to a stranger like we've met before, but when i don't want to be around people or I've hit that \"saturation point\" i become a miserable fucking asshole. It just becomes, too much. I look for places to get away, i become quiet, if people push me i become agitated and aggressive. I simply want to be left alone.\n\nI live in the SF bay area now and i hate it. The place sucks. It's full of people the cost of living is ridiculous and i bust my ass for what actually amounts to peanuts in this area. No one talks about anything other than their work and everyone is juat looking to find that golden opportunity in someone esle. If it weren't for the sweet job my fianc\u00e9e got, I wouldn't be caught dead in the area. That's how i feel about it, and i fucking LIKE people. I like meeting interesting folks, sharing a drink or two with strangers and generally being around friendly people.\n\nMy point to this rambling is, don't go back to nyc and try to force yourself into a mould you know you cannot happily fit in. You are being selfish, i guess, but it's your life you're allowed to be selfish and uncompromising abour things that are really important to you. If you don't think you'll survive in nyc and have a healthy, rewarding life that you want to live, then don't move back there.\n\nWhat you probably can do is meet them halfway. You should probably visit more often if that's something you don't do much, they should visit you, too for that matter. Your parents do clearly love you and care about you. To them, people from nyc who are literally no more than a few feet away from perfect strangers all the time, a guy who decides to go out and live in the woods must have something wrong with him. People like you and i on the other hand think it's perfectly normal to want your space, privacy and god forbid honest to goodness quiet. \n\nDon't feel guilty about living your life the way that is of value to you. Now you may want to date around someday. Having a companion you connect with and love is worth it, but if you're not interested now that's fine. If you're not interested ever, that's also fine. You don't owe your parents any grandkids. Also, don't isolate yourself entirely simply because you haven't had too many friends in the past. It is good to have someone to talk with, share a beer with and sometimes just sit in silence together. True friends don't need to fill the silence. You may have that with your sister though. It sounds like the two of you have a healthy relationship and she spends a decent amount of time visiting. \nRemember that your family may be putting pressure on her too, to try and convince you to come home, which isn't fair to her if she just wants to see her older brother.\n\nI get the isolated living, i really do, i miss it. I miss not having anyone around that i don't want around and i miss knowing that i can go to my family plot of land in the Adirondacks and know that i am the only person for miles. That kind of existence recharges me. Gives me space and a place to think, a place to do my own thing. If that's what you're comfortable with and truly love, then don't compromise that, even for family. It's better that they see you happy 4-6 times a year rather than every weekend, dating a woman you don't care enough about to really be with and looking like shit every weekend because your psychological needs are so far from being met. There is some compromises to be made though. You've got to visit your parents more. They miss you and if the only bad blood between you and your family is that they wished you were around more, well you're pretty lucky to have parents thaf miss you like that. \n\nGood luck man, I'm a bit jealous of your living situation. It sounds like you have at least got that figured out.",
            "> First, do you think I'm selfish?\n\nIt's not selfish to live your life how you want, as long as it's not harming others. The second bit is the bit that's up for debate to some degree. \n\nA utilitarian approach would be to figure out how much you'd hate going back to NYC, and tally up the small amounts of dissatisfaction that your family has for you not being around. You'd also have to subtract off any dissatisfaction from them feeling like they've pushed you into coming back. ",

When my husband and I were dating (nearing 40) it became even worse, so it was \"but we already have a cat\"... like that made sense, eventually they stopped.  Cause now I'm old enough where carrying a child is high risk and I figure they don't want to bring it up any more.\n\nAs someone who others feel I \"randomly moved to\" (and I wasn't even isolated, I just didn't know anyone, it's a decent sized college town I moved to) you just keep having to stand up for you and what matters to you.

Until that happens, ask them to understand you've found a precious peace, you have that contentment within yourself and it hurts when your loved ones can't accept it. \n\nAlso, they may feel less worried if you had some sort of emergency contact plan that you shared with them. If any of my kids lived your lifestyle my biggest worry would that they'd get hurt or sick and no one would know. Carbon monoxide, choking, an injury are valid concerns.  Perhaps if they knew you had a local contact that could call them or vice versa should something happen it may give them a little peace of mind.  You might think of is as a little system redundancy. \n\nHow many days would pass before you were missed? If you were found unresponsive how would your family be contacted?

Lack of use could make these skills deteriorate, but I could also see them inproving due to isolation because you're not constantly expending this energy and have a \"safe space\" to retreat to when the socialization is overwhelming.\n\nIn the end, if this is what happiness looks like for you, try to get your family to see that.

I'm from Texas and have only been to NYC once, but I'd think that if you grew up there you'd learn that being crowded, never alone, and paying a ton for your own space is just what you have to put up with to be an adult. That's normal for them. They have to put up with the downsides of living in a huge city, and they're probably unconsciously angry that you've found a way around all of it. \n\nYou do you, visit them once a year and remember why you left, and then go back home to your fresh air and freedom.",
            "I think they're right about trying to have a family or relationship.\nThey think you might regret it later on in life and as they're family it's their duty to tell you these things. Nothing wrong with giving it a try!",

If this lifestyle makes you happy, then go for it. \n\nMy only caveat would be that even though you are a young man still you might want to think about putting a plan in place for when you are older and might, but hopefully won't, lose your mobility and/or need extra care. I imagine as you live so frugally you would be able to save up for something that would suit your needs. \n\nAlso, it might calm your parents fears if they knew that you were in regular contact with someone such as your online friends. It might calm them to know that there is someone you speak/write to everyday who might sound the alarm if you didn't make contact. I know that this is a doomsday scenario, but I think they would like to know that you wouldn't be left for days if you slipped in the shower or became ill or something?\n\nDoes that seem reasonable?",
            "I don't think you're being selfish for living your life the way you want. But it might be nice for your family if you got an airbnb in New York a few weeks a year and visited them. If you see them more often and they realise how happy you are with your life it might make them more accepting. ",
            "They're the ones that are selfish for not allowing you to be happy living life the way you want to.\n\nIt's like when parents tell their kids they have to have children so they can have grandbabies and the kids are being selfish for not breeding.\n\nWanting someone to alter their life, or live the LifeScript^TM because that's what they want you to do, or that's what you should do, or whatever... is the one being selfish. They're selfishly looking after their wants, or their jealousy instead of being happy for you.\n\nGo visit them every now and then... and have them visit you. And if it becomes a one-way street where they never want to come to your ends... continue the relationship over the phone. Or don't... if they keep calling you names.\n\n/r/childfree, /r/justnomil, and /r/raisedbynarcissists have a lot of similar situations and advice. Maybe you'll find some parallels there.\n\nAnd I probably have more online friends (through music) than IRL. I've even met some of them IRL after talking online for years... they're no less of a friend than someone you see in person or talk to over the phone.\n\nKeep doing you. Don't move back.",
            "Aside from your family's wishes, do you have any desire to have a romantic relationship?   Your post suggests you do not.   If you actually do, then ultimately your family may be more accepting of your situation (fwiw).  If you have no interest in ever finding a partner, do you consider yourself asexual?  Or do you value your isolation more than what a companion could bring you?   I'm sorry if these questions are too invasive. ",
            "I fully support anyone living their life the way they want. If your happy where you are then absolutely stay there. I do wonder if there is more going on here then they wanting to be closer to you. Maybe they can't fanthom you being happy in your current set-up or as others have said they hope this is step 1 in getting you married/having kids.\n\nI do wonder though if a compromise can be reached. In my travels of the US once your outside of a city it becomes way less populated. Could you find a spot outside of NYC and replicate what you have created where you are now? You get to be outside of the city and keep your current set-up but your closer to your family. Perhaps find a New York subreddit and see if anyone there has any suggestions on where to live.",

            "I cant believe no one has said this (or at least I think), you are pretty much giving the two extremes. NYC is as city living as you can get, and the same with having moved away to the middle of nowhere. \n\nThere is definitely some middle ground here. There are probably hundreds of small upstate NY towns that are pretty secluded but still over easy enough access to NYC. Maybe this can be an option for you and could make both your family happy and yourself. ",

There's nothing wrong with wanting small town life but it is a bit troubling to not want friends in real life and only want them online. There might be something you can do with proper help to be better with people instead of just giving up. You don't need to live in NYC or have a family but having real friends in real life who aren't your family could be great. I don't doubt at all that you're happier now than you were but that doesn't mean you can't be even happier with help.",
            "I recommend four years in the military. It is a great system for people who have these issues for a few reasons. One: It is one of those contributions to / interactions with society that gets people to leave you alone pretty much for the rest of your life. It is a get out of judgement free card in a lot of ways. Two: It is a logical system in which an E-5 tells and E-4 what to do, an O-2 laughs at an O-3's jokes all the time, etc. The rules of interacting are stupidly simple for a reason. Much of the chaos of regular interactions are gone. some crave this, and it puts their careers in ruin. Some are pleased by it, and it makes them great Soldiers. Channel your Forrest Gump stereotypes, here. Three: You can enlist for the number of years you want. You can handle a three or four year commitment, and enjoy the GI bill that pays for your next degree after you get out. Four: You learn a lot about how government computer systems and contracting for them works. Five: It's a good kick in the ass for your fitness (not sure if this applies).",

He didn't leave the city to live in a suburb or a farm. He said he lives alone in a small village in what sounds like literally the middle of nowhere. Apparently he works from home, and he said himself he has no reason to go out since he doesn't like people.\n\nBasically I'm saying OP sounds antisocial as you could possibly be without being agoraphobic, and maybe the family is right?\n\nEdit: I was gonna try and not say this because it sounds really mean, but honestly OP sounds autistic as fuck.

            "First things first, no need to move back. However, it is important to visit people occasionally. I moved halfway across the country to avoid my parents, but I still come back every 3rd Xmas or so to visit, and they come visit me every summer. Start doing the same with your family. A couple of days in the city won't kill you, and giving your family permission to come visit you might help them understand your lifestyle more.",

I know a lot of people like you.  Prolonged absorption in using them does shape your mind, like anything else.  I think it can encourage anti-social behavior.  I've met personally at least 3 people who were successful computer engineers but quit because they felt it was an unhealthy.\n\nI just have a sense you're going to be very unhappy one day.  You're in the middle of life, and you've spent at least 2/3 of it in school, college, and jobs.  Living in a fast paced city like NYC might not be for you, and maybe you are just tired for the moment.\n\nIn the end, it's your life.  You could be doing a lot worse.\n \n\n",

            "So first off, man live your life if you live for someone else then you're going to be miserable, however, let me be the devils advocate.\n\nI'm a huge dnd nerd I just gobble it up and for years I played with the same group. Over time that group fell apart but I still wanted to play so I went out and met some new people and offered to DM for them. Now these guys were long time buddies and they were big online gamers so they had a friend who was similar to you that they had never really met in person save for I think the occasional birthday party, and he also wanted to play. The thing is we set up in a game shop which was in the city, it was crowed and full of people playing other games. So obviously their friend was apprehensive about joining us.\n\nBut for me dnd is about the social interaction, I have no idea how people enjoy playing via chat or the web so I was not down for him playing remotely. Eventually he caved and joined us. He was quite and awkward for the first bit but once he got into his own he really jumped in and became a large vocal part of the group.\n\nNow you and I are opposite human beings, in that I love people and I flourish in crowds so of course I also do stuff like stand-up and improv. So I invited my friends to a few shows and most importantly was open mic improv. Eventually our quite friend tagged along and actually fell in love with it. And more importantly fell in love with a girl at improv. Now this was some time ago and I've since moved but they're still together and he's really come out of his shell.\n\nSo while yes live how you want, maybe just get out there a bit, try new things because maybe there's a social circle out there that you haven't found yet that may change your life."

Sometimes adulthood is not given, you have to take it, even taking it from the people you love.\n\nYour relationship with your mom will never be the same as it was, when you were growing up.

Keep your head high and surround yourself with people who are good to you (meaning they not only do nice things, but more importantly they don't treat you poorly).",
            ">Let me know when you are brave enough to be an ~~adult~~ abusive relationship.\n\nYou should never need to be brave enough to love someone. If you need bravery to survive them, you dont need them. \n\nOP don't go back, if you do you will be actively telling him you want that behavior to continue in an escalated manner",
            "I went back and read your original post. Oh, heeeeelllll no. Good for you for dumping him! And good for you for doing it with a short text. He really didn't deserve more.\n\nHe thinks he's very \"emotionally intelligent\"? Oh Lord help us... And his responses when you broke up were super manipulative.",

            "As someone who has been through something incredibly similar I still see the manipulation in his words and would be surprised if he didn't pop up again.\n\nIn one breath he's telling you that you'll come back to him: \"you'll come to your senses and figure it out\".\n\nThe next he's telling you how great he is by loving you despite the supposedly terrible things you've done: ''I will not tolerate it but you're amazing and I love you\".\n\nHe's belittling you whilst telling you he loves you like he's hoping that you will see how wonderful he is and you will be grateful he still cares about you despite your so called behaviour.  \n\n\"Please don't contact me again\" is more about making a show as to how unreasonable he thinks you've been and I honestly don't believe it means its the end for him.  He's still trying to manipulate you into thinking you're in the wrong and should or will come back to him.\n\nI'm so glad you've made the smart strong choice to stay away from him because I can tell you 100% guaranteed that if you fall for the line about how much he still cares about you or consider for even a second that you were ever in the wrong then you will give him free pass and strength to continue isolating you from other people by wrongly calling you unreasonable.  I fell for this once and it ended really badly for me.  Keep him blocked no matter what.",

I cannot fathom what a self important tool this guy is... \" I FeEl LiKe I'm Not  A pRiORiTy!1\" \nYeah, no shit!! The conversation was between you and your friends! I'm so glad you're moving on from this self absorbed loser, OP. You've always been ready for an adult relationship- he was totally projecting!",

            "Repetitively saying, I am going to breakup with you is not healthy. You did the right thing.

I will second what the poster below said and say I feel proud you stood up for yourself. Hopefully you can get to those projects and spend more time with your friends and family without feeling guilty!",
            "Wow he was a real drama queen",
            "His text screams major nice guy. You dodged a bullet on this one. What's concerning is he wasn't happy about you making plans with a friend, and that's a huge red flag.",
            "Haha this guy is a toy. My ex would alternate between telling me I am awesome and then that I would never find anyone to like me. I broke up with him and I am now engaged to an amazing man. Abusive men always make a last desperate attempt to make you feel unworthy of anything better. I am glad you didn't cave in.",
            "Good for you, now stay away! It\u2019s incredibly annoying when people threaten to break up over minor issues. It\u2019s really disproportionate and kind of takes the conversation hostage because when you like someone you obviously don\u2019t want them to break up with you. It\u2019s okay when you do it over a real deal breaker, but not as a matter of routine!",

Good riddance.  \n   \nHe sounds like someone who read a few psychology articles on setting boundaries and limits, but he has no self-awareness.  So instead of combining those lessons with normal behavior, he's applied them to a world view where any time he's unhappy... it must be because you wronged him.   It's really impressive how he says he doesn't deserve to be treated this way, in regards to being broken up with.  Uh, no one is obligated to stay with you no matter what you \"deserve?\" .....",

It\u2019s definitely a form of manipulation. He refuses to compromise, it\u2019s his way or the high way. It\u2019s hard, he\u2019s the first man I have real chemistry with and i know he has baggage he ignores like most men. I\u2019m just unsure what to do and not strong enough to leave. I commend you on your strength.",

            "Sounds like he is being insensitive, nothing wrong with being sensitive.\n\nMy mother told me to grow thicker skin, I told her I used to and it weighed me down, so I shed it off and have good boundaries in place of that thick and defensive skin I once had because of her.\n\nSounds like he may lacks empathy for you given the title alone.",

As soon as I read that he said that stuff about not prioritising the relationship when you said to were seeing your friend I had to come to the update and hoped you had dumped him. No one needs an emotionally manipulative pathetic little boy for a partner.",
            "I'm so glad you broke it off early. That's why he's 42 and single, cuz no one puts up with that kind of stuff. And I'm glad you stood your ground. There is no reason that anyone should make you feel bad or guilt trip you in that situation, you literally did nothing wrong.",

            "This guy is definitely a \"nice guy\" and it sounds like you did the right thing.  He sounds incredibly manipulative and emotionally abusive.  Take it from someone who was in several abusive relationships, when it starts with emotional abuse, it usually ends with physical abuse.  You dodged a bullet.  I'm proud of you.",

You are strong and I believe in you! Keep taking care of yourself <3",
