[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dqrr7d/my\\_dad\\_is\\_moving\\_in\\_with\\_his\\_long\\_term\\_girlfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dqrr7d/my_dad_is_moving_in_with_his_long_term_girlfriend/)\n\n**TLDR - I have visited my Dad and his girlfriends new house, twice for a few days each time. I have felt very strange in the new situation and dynamics but they have all been very welcoming to me. Any advice on how to get pass these worries would be great. All points of views are welcome regardless of what role you play in your blended family experience (past, present or future.)**\n\nHello everyone, I'm Mason and I am a 14 year old boy! I just wanted to update you all on the progression of my new situation since my original post. You were all so great with the advice that I really wanted to do this.\n\nSo I took the advice that one or two of you gave me and decided to ask my parents if I could split my days shorter when visiting for the first time just in case I found it overwhelming. They both agreed and didn't make me feel awkward about the suggestion at all. I have completed my first set of visits and went back a second time.\n\nMy Dad introduced me to my new bedroom which was a decent size. He gave me a budget and then took me out to get loads of bedroom related stuff. I really enjoyed it and it was nice to have some ownership over my new space. My Dads girlfriend cooked a pasta meal that I thoroughly enjoyed and we all had a movie night. My first night in my room felt a bit odd and I had a restless night but that soon improved. Me and her son got on well enough as usual and we had a laugh during the movie night.\n\nBy the second day it still felt strange. I wanted to go back home at it was so unusual to be in the house. The realisation hit me that this would now be a regular thing. They are both very loved up and affectionate I don't really understand that feeling of weirdness about it as he has moved out a while ago and I have seen them together many times. I guess I will work through it the best I can. My Dad and her son get on really well which gave me a pang of jealousy but I really tried not to show it as I believe I am the one with the issue and not them. My Dad had given me one on one time so there was no really reason to get envious.\n\nOverall I am happy for them but I did genuinely try and any insecurities or worries I had, I put to one side and planned to wait and see how the second visit was... By the second visit I currently do feel a bit like a guest (a well treated guest) at a residence. They have a solid dynamic that I am trying to find my place in and all have in jokes that I don't really understand. I never noticed this before but I realised that they all get on extremely well and have obviously spent a lot of time together in the past. I am trying to fit into their routine and ways of doing things and I realised his girlfriends routine seems dominantly the way things are done in the house meaning she and her son get by more easily if that makes sense. I feel I need to be on my best behaviour at all times and am constantly not wanting to offend intentionally. I have a feeling my Dad stayed at their old place rather a lot and this is why they get on so well on a day to day basis. This made the green eyed monster come out. Pretty sure this is fairly normal but Reddit helps me to chill out a bit as well as the suggested writing it down on paper. I have a lot to work through and I have decided to try and be more self reliant now that I am getting older (slightly sad but cool to.) I know they will listen to my concerns if I am worried. Another piece of good advice I got on here. I have no idea why I am not level headed on certain things anymore, the emotions just pour out via my mind and then settles down.\n\nAny advice, suggestions or your own experience of this would be appreciated. Please give it to me straight, I don't need mollycoddling...\n\nEDIT (27/11/19) - I AM EXTREMELY TAKEN BACK BY ALL THE WONDERFUL AND SUPPORTIVE MESSAGES YOU GUYS AND GALS HAVE POSTED...\n\nI am sorry I have not responded yet but I have been so busy trying to take my mind off of this situation that I have barely has time to post on here. I promise I will reply soon. School journeys have been hard but are becoming more common if not demotivating. I still feel like a relative visiting. I have done chores as suggested but feel I have to do regular and daily chores so that I earn my place in the house, which I suppose is true to a degree. I still feel conflicted at seeing them together and know I need to keep trying but I just want to go back home to familiar surroundings when I am at my Dads new home.",

            "I just think you sound incredibly emotionally mature, and I think it\u2019s wonderful how you are taking ownership of your discomfort. \n\nJust wanted to encourage you! Things will feel better as time goes on. It seems like you\u2019re already doing the \u2018right\u2019 things.",
            "Sounds pretty normal to me. It would feel strange and weird for anybody in your shoes. It takes time to adjust to a new living situation, regardless of the specifics.\n\nHonestly, your emotional intelligence seems above average and I'm sure you'll find a groove in this new situation that you're comfortable with, it will just take time. It sounds like you could talk to your dad about how you're doing as well (the good and the bad). It seems like he and his GF and step son were also worried about making you feel more at home with them, so I'm sure your dad will make sure your emotional needs are taken care of.",
            "[deleted]",
            "So, it sounds like you'll definitely slowly get into a groove but I just want to point something out. \n\nIt's good that you aren't letting your feelings control you, but you are allowed to have those feelings and those feelings are normal and okay. And it might help you to get those feelings out there. It sounds like the adults in your life are all supportive and they want you to feel comfortable with this transition. Since that's the case you could say that you appreciate everything they've done and mention some of the stuff that still makes you feel like kind of an outsider. Maybe there are solutions that you can all work at. Or, if you don't want to talk to your parents, your school guidance counselor is a great third party you can vent to without worrying about offending anybody\n\nBlending families is hard, but it sounds like everyone wants this to go well. I'm sure you'll feel comfortable in no time.",
            "You sound like such a great kid, Mason. My younger son is about your age, and my older son a bit older. It's totally okay to talk to your dad about all of this. It sounds like both of your parents love you a bunch and are trying to do right by you. And it sounds like his girlfriend means well. She might be having more of a say in how things go because women are traditionally expected to sort of make the household flow well. Is there something you and your dad have done together or differently that might help you feel a bit more comfortable? I bet if there was something (like maybe how you set the table or when you watch tv, that sort of thing) you could do more like how you are used to, your dad would be open to hearing about it. \n\nThere is going to be some adjustment and anxiety, and your jealousy is totally understandable. You are still grieving the loss of your family home. This is an awful lot of changes in less than two years. It's okay that you feel overwhelmed. Please don't feel you have to apologize for or explain your strong emotions. Strong emotions are totally understandable and to be expected in this situation. \n\nI wish you could feel comfortable telling your dad you are a bit jealous, because it probably doesn't even occur to him that you feel threatened at all. The other boy, the 16 year old -- even if your dad gets on with him well, you're his baby, you know? Of course you're not a baby, but you're his sweet boy. You've grown up with him as your dad. You are irreplaceable. There will never be anyone else like you in the whole world for him, no one he loves the way he loves you. I absolutely promise you that's the complete truth. \n\nI wonder if it also might help if you and your dad's girlfriend had some more time to get to know each other, so you could develop your own relationship? What if you and your dad took up a hobby together, or what if there was a game you played all four of you, but you asked them not to play without you? You can ask them to include you in new traditions. \n\nMy heart is breaking a bit. You don't have to be self-reliant, and it's okay to lean on your parents still. You can also talk to other kids, or other adults in your life. I think you could also talk to your dad's girlfriend and let her know you are feeling a bit sad and jealous of the family they seem to have formed, and that you want to be part of this family too. \n\nGood luck, kiddo. I'm sorry this is so hard. It sounds like you are very loved.",
            "Hey Mason! I\u2019m glad to hear that your suggestions were met with understanding and your parents have seemed to have listened to you. \n\nMy parents broke up when I was very young (3 or 4) yet I do remember still feeling jealous and weird when my dad met a girlfriend whom he moved in with when I was around 8, despite being alright with his girlfriends before that. It\u2019s normal to feel apprehensive in a new dynamic and as an only child, it\u2019s also easy to feel jealous about your father suddenly \u201ddividing\u201d his attention between more people on a regular basis. \n\nYou seem like a very insightful person, and are good at cataloguing your feelings and seem to be apt at knowing which of your experiences are subjective \u2014 even so, it might be good to try to find a way where you can get confirmation from the outside when you\u2019re troubled with fears and anxieties that you think might not reflect the situation. \nI know it\u2019s difficult to do that especially when you\u2019re a teenager and working hard on becoming an independent person but remember that it\u2019s not childish or stupid to go to your parents with these fears again, when they pop up.\n\nYou\u2019ve stated that you\u2019ve talked to both of your parents, but have you talked to your father\u2019s girlfriend about these things too? It might feel difficult to open up to her, but it might be good for you both to define the relationship between the two of you. For example, discuss whether you\u2019re comfortable with a \u201dmom\u201d role from her, how you aim to respect her household and the rules there but how you also feel awkward since the dynamic is different and you don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s your home yet. Perhaps her and your father BOTH knowing about your feelings will make it easier for them both to make you feel more at home. \n\nIn any case the situation is still very new and it\u2019s completely normal to still feel a bit awkward about it, and to have some jealousy as well. You\u2019ve already opened up a line of communication regarding it and I think that keeping that line open will help the situation. \n\nAll the best to you while you navigate this complicated situation!",
            "Hi Mason,\n\nYou really shouldn't worry about seeming needy, while being self reliant is a great skill, knowing when you need support is equally important.\n\nI do think that you should raise the issue of the rules in your Dad's new home seem to be being geared towards the convenience of the girlfriend and her son.\n\nIt is disappointing that although your Dad wanted to change his work hours to enable school pick up and drop off of you, his girlfriend stepped in and stopped that due to the affect it would have on her time with your father.\n\nSituations like that one are likely to come up again and if you continually cope with that disappointment internally you will (should!) feel resentful.\n\nIt isn't your role to fit perfectly into their lives with no impact on anyone but you.  It is a shame the girlfriend couldn't have at least agreed to the change in work hours for 6 months until you settled in.\n\nThey chose to live somewhere far from your school, but it only affects you.  That is not treating your needs equally with the needs of the other 3 in the family.\n\nYou don't need to be the only person to compromise.\n\nBest of luck xx\n\nEdit: OP may choose to live with roommates or an SO, and you wouldn't want to agree to everything in the household being organised around their needs and not yours, just so that  they like you and you aren't inconvenient.  It's your home too.\n\nEdit 2: With The lack of support for OP's travel to and from school I am concerned that OP will decline opportunities for extra curricula activities due to the constraints of the bus timetable.  OP may end up forced to either miss out on development opportunities or be forced to stay at Mums to enjoy opportunities and then be blamed for not trying to fit at Dad's girlfriends place",
            "Hey!\n\nI have been in almost the exact same situation as you. Parents got separated at 13, dad and his new girlfriend lived together, and I had to adjust accordingly. I completely understand how it can be uncomfortable for you right now, that's exactly how I felt when I was your age. To this day, I still sometimes feel awkward because it doesn't always feel like 'my home', but I know it is and love my entire family!! Your dad's new home is just as much your home as it is his, even though he is there every day and you might not be. I understand why you might be feeling an influx of emotions right now. You're currently going through a huge change in your life right now, and it's completely okay to feel emotional about this entire situation. I know it's uncomfortable but treat it as if it's your home too because it is, and try to form a relationship with your dad's girlfriend and her son. I wish all the best for you, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions!\n\nedit: a few words",
            "You are handling this very well and maturely.",
            "This is cool in so many ways, your parents must be really proud of you. I want to encourage you to keep writing things down like this, you\u2019re very thoughtful and clear and your writing is miles ahead of your years, which is a rare gift indeed, keep it up!",
            "When I was 14 I could hardly spell",
            "At the end of your post you mentioned not knowing why the emotions are so hard to control now and I just want to suggest that it could be puberty kicking in. Hormones are no joke and it can make dealing with all of the accompanying emotions seem really strong and impossible to get over, but if you try to stay level-headed about it like you have so far, you\u2019ll be fine. Just try to recognize when your emotions are building up and find a healthy outlet for them like you\u2019ve been doing with writing it out. I wish I had your emotional maturity even now as a 26 year old!",
            "The fact that you try so hard to make this work and the way you reflect on yourself tells me you're very mature for your age. You seem to me like a sensitive, caring young man.\n\nYou don't feel at home yet. This is normal. They have their entire lives and routines ingrained in this house and now you've been added. As much as I commend your dad for doing his best to let you take ownership, this feeling needs to grow on its own. This takes time.\n\nIf I can offer one bit of advice, it would be to talk to people. If you're as sensitive as I think you are, you do yourself no favors bottling stuff up. Talk to your dad, he loves you.",
            "I am truly impressed with how mature you are I  handling this. You're a very impressive young man.",
            "You've covered the why and the fix, but I don't know if you noticed.\n\n>I never noticed this before but I realised that they all get on extremely well and have obviously spent a lot of time together in the past.\n\nThey're spending time together to get to that cohesiveness you're seeing.  The more time you spend in that environment, the more you'll mesh and the more comfortable you'll feel.  While it's understandable that you might want to pull back and spend less time there as you ease in, it's actually working against you to do that.\n\nYou might also ask your parents if you can see a therapist.  You don't have to be broken to benefit from a little help now and then, and a good one might give you some good tools for the jealousy you mentioned, as well as ways to feel more comfortable in your new normal.",
            "I love that you are able to recognize the feelings you're experiencing and why, and begin to identify whether it is rational to feel that way. A lot of adults struggle with this skill that you have mastered at 14! I want to reassure you that the things you're feeling are normal when dealing with such a significant life change. It can definitely be difficult to find your place in an established dynamic, and it probably feels awkward at first but trust that as you spend more time there, you will find where you fit in. I know you're worried about talking too much to your dad about this, but I don't think you have any reason to be! Parents are meant to have your back and I'm sure he'd like to be kept updated on how you're adjusting and what he can do to help.",
            "Hi Mason. I can't really relate to your unique situation but you sound like you have a really good insight into how you are going to navigate this. I'd probably liken it to homesickness which is really tough.\n\nWhen I went to boarding school a bit younger than you and everything was too big and new and weird to really deal with but you get through it. When I was a Dorm Prefect the first night I took my little Scrunts in the corridor and told them we are a team now. Some of you will adapt better than others and some of you are really going to struggle for the first few months but if you are worried about your roommates just come and get me up. God I drank a lot of hot chocolate at 2am that term. \n\nI think you will be fine. It sounds like everyone is very aware this is going to be difficult for a while but you have a good line of communication going. You'll find your groove. Trust yourself. If you need time to yourself take it.\n\nI used to come down like Thors Hammer on my girls if they got too far out of line but you have to give them scope to work it out themselves.",
            "Hey Mason, I'm glad you updated us on your situation! My parents divorced when I was young, and eventually my dad moved in with a woman who had three daughters. I can tell you that it will be weird for a while, it certainly was for me and I was definitely not nearly as mature as you are at 14. Writing things down in a journal is also a great idea as you said you were doing. I would keep focused on having good interactions with your dad's girlfriend and her son, and this sort of guest feeling will fade with time. \n\nHope everything continues to go well for you bud!",
            "Well done navigating this all. You are doing well. Change takes time. \n\nI'd suggest working on your relationship with dad's girlfriend.  Tell them both you would like to know her better.  Work on feeling more natural and at ease. Maybe you two hang out solo and learn something about each other. Or try a fact a day - have her tell you something about herself each day. That may lead to some ongoing conversations and chats, kind of like breaking the ice, but in a personal way. \n\nPerhaps take on some small chores when there to give yourself a sense that you live there too?\n\nYou are doing great. Be patient.",
            "The way you describe yourself, your feelings, and thoughts at your age is really impressive. I realized a long time ago that it is much easier to be aware of what is off rather than what is working, and you should take a step back and realize while things may not feel super easy at the moment, you've already come soooo far in this process. How you contain and examine your feelings of envy is proof of that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt makes total sense to feel like a guest, because despite your dad being there, we're all kind of guests in any space until it becomes familiar and we have our own routine in it. I think people who move into a new home in general get feelings like this, yours are just amplified by the differences of your family at the moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're doing all the right stuff. Being proactive, emotionally mature, and I really think if you stay on that path then this will eventually pass and you're going to be just fine :)\n\nI don't think these feelings are bad, I think you may even want to deeply consider them while they are present because like anything in life, once it passes, a small part of you will miss it. Even newness because it has... exploration. Building new traditions, routines, just because they have some now doesn't mean you don't get to carve your own space!",
            "Aw, you are such a sweetheart. Your feelings are all normal. You don't have to be the perfect child, never getting upset or making a fuss. When things don't feel quite right, it's perfectly okay to bring it up in a respectful way. This is a big change, it will take some getting used to and adjustments. You sound like such a nice young man, and Im proud of you from afar for being so mature and accepting.",
            "You are killing it dude, such major change can be really stressful, im hearing you are scared at the unknown future and are feeling like an outsider in the new living arrangements, you sound incredibly mature though, i encourage you to keep writing, perhaps start journaling if you dont already? Also consider reframing your thoughts of jelousy, perhaps it just means you really care about your father, i hope all goes well for you as you traverse this new landscape, remember every day is an opportunity to learn, your dads girlfriend and her son could be great potential friends and allies. Stay strong, i believe you are on the right path. All will be well if you persevere.",
            "> I have no idea why I am not level headed on certain things anymore, the emotions just pour out via my mind and then settles down.\n\nThis is *completely* normal when you're 14. Honestly, it is. You're dealing well with the new situation and you sound very self-aware. \n\nThings will settle down once you get used to the new status quo, I think. It's not unreasonable, too, to ask your dad to do stuff with you one on one. Maybe you guys can just get out of the house and go to a movie or a meal together and have that time as well as the blended family stuff.",
            "I promise it's going to get easier! You haven't lived through that many radical changes in your life, so you don't have the experience to know how these things play out. Let me tell you - it feels weird, like you described, even though there's nothing \"wrong.\" You talk to the people you love about your feelings, you sometimes get mad or resentful or overwhelmed and might lash out at those close to you, but you'll work through it and they'll understand. Day by day, week by week, this will become your new normal. Sometimes you'll think back on how your life used to be and feel sad, or feel nothing. Sometimes you'll slip back into feeling like you do today, and that'll pass, and then you'll go on to college and it'll happen all over again.\n\nYou seem super thoughtful and should be very proud of yourself. Keep up the good work, and good luck.",
            "May I make a suggestion as a stepmom myself. Spend some one on one time with your dads GF. Go out and do something fun together, or grab dinner and chat. You may find you have more in common with her then you think. Very shortly after my husband and I moved in together my teenage step kids moved in and it was a huge adjustment for us all. I hung out quite a bit with my stepson and we would go for drives or grab a meal or whatever quite often. We became really close and those times of hanging out with him are some of my favorite memories.",
            "Hi Mason! \nI can definitely relate to your situation. My parents divorced when I was 17, a bit older than you, but not much. It can be a very hard, emotional, confusing situation. You seem to be very well-spoken and intelligent. Both of these qualities will help you to navigate this situation and any that arise in the future. A bit of advice if you\u2019d like it. Both my mother and father have since been in several relationships, and I\u2019ve learned to understand that these people are going to have a part of my parent. But, they will never have MY part. The part that saw you take your first steps, or taught you how to swim, or took care of you when you were sick. \nThat part of you will never be replaced. But one thing that really helped me navigate these feelings of jealousy, or even anger when it arose, was therapy. I would recommend talking to your mother about it, or your father if you feel comfortable! \nYou have a right to feel at home in both your mother and father\u2019s houses. It will take time, but conversation is key. Even if it is hard, try to be as honest as possible. I wish you the best of luck!",
            "Sounds like you are a very mature young man who is thinking this difficult situation through thoughtfully. Could you maybe open up to your Dad a bit more about how you feel about this? Would showing him this post help (does he understand Reddit?)",
            "You sound like a very emotionally mature young man!  \nKeep up the good work of paying attention to how you feel and never be afraid to express yourself.  All of what you are feeling is justified and warranted.\n\nMy parents separated when I was young, about 7 years old and my father pursued a relationship with a woman who I did not like and she often meddled in my life.  She would search my room, expect me to carry out her demands and was very aggressive in her approach to being a part of my life.  Not only that, but she belittled my mother on many occasions and often made me feel insecure about the council I had received from my parents.  Fortunately, she is no longer in my life but this was years after I had grown up and moved out.\n\nChange can make you uncomfortable and you do have to recognize that your new situation is just that, new.  It will take time to adjust but as long as your new situation is welcoming and others around you try to show love and respect, you should try and feed off that.  Learning about new people and experiencing new situations is the best way for you to continue to grow your emotional latticework.\n\nKeep being who you are, and surround yourself with loving relationships - life can't get any better.",
            "Hey Mason, I just want to say you are coping with a lot, and handling things admirably, so please don't be hard on yourself about feeling uncomfortable or even jealous or angry at times. Those are very understandable feelings.\n\nYou had a pretty big upheaval in your life and you are still adjusting. It also seems like your dad neglected you for a little while, and at the same time bonded with his new family. I could easily see how that would raise all kinds of unpleasant emotions.\n\nI do think over time things will get easier and better. However, there is nothing wrong with feeling like something is \"off\" or that there are things you don't like. You are NOT the one with the issue. You are the one trying to make the best sense of things you can while the adults, not you, are rearranging your life. So please give yourself permission to feel however you feel. All feelings are valid.\n\nI really admire how you have kept communication open with your parents and talked about how you felt, and I encourage you to keep doing that. Best of luck to you.",
            "Hey bud! My dad divorced his second wife when I was 14, and I had a similar experience meeting my current stepmom and her child. It\u2019s never easy and you\u2019re processing your emotions really well, I think you should definitely keep going but also don\u2019t be afraid to talk to your dad! I know it can be hard, but you seem emotionally mature enough to express that you want to fit into the family dynamic but things are a bit overwhelming right now. It\u2019s also totally normal to feel weird and jealous of your dads girlfriend/her son.  \n\nI wanna echo what everyone else is saying and just say that your doing a great job!",
            "On the jealousy bit, I related. When I was your age my dad told us he had a girlfriend and she had two kids. Her daughter was only 3 years younger than me, and my dad LOVED telling me how similar we were and how she reminded him of me when I wasn't with them. This made young me steaming mad bc how could he compare us like that, and does he love her more, does he get along better with her, I had bunch of mean jealous thoughts about her. And honestly, I'm 21 now and I still struggle with this from time to time. Just try to remember that your dad can have a father son relationship with him and still care about you just as much as he always has. Feel free to discuss these feelings with him, it made me feel a million times better when my dad and I had a heart to heart about it, and maybe it'll help to resolve your own feelings of jealousy. It's totally normal to have those feelings about new step siblings",
            "Agreed with others. You are being amazing and mature about the situation. Hanging out/interacting with the step-family is never easy, not even for mature adults from what I've observed!\n\n\nThank you for giving it a shot and cordial about it.\n\n\nMay take some time to get used to... not easy since you probably feel like you're 'staying over' or living at a hotel few times a week. May get easier.",
            "First of all, can I just say: Holy shit you are coming at this from an astoundingly mature and introspective place. I work with teens 12-18 and let me tell ya... that is quite rare for a 14 year old. Also, way to outsource your emotional troubleshooting and look for help, even if it is from a bunch of online strangers. You empower yourself when you take ownership of your emotions and can then begin to map out where they stem from.\n\nThese observations you've made are a great start toward coming to understand where these seemingly bizarre and acute emotions are coming from. The truth is, it will take much more time to develop a sense of ease and comfort in this new environment. During this time, Please PLEASE be kind to yourself. Don't beat yourself up for having an emotion that doesn't align with the logic side of your brain. Emotions will come and go. Acknowledge them, take note of what triggered them, and when you find time -  write about it. \n\nI also recommend you consider talking about some of these emotions with your dad after you have had time to process them a little. Opening up that dialogue is not only a way to  help him understand where you are coming from much better, but also form your own close bonds and trust. \n\nHonestly, you're going to be just fine. ;)",
            "One thing you'll realize with age is the necessity of feeling your emotions. \n\nShoving them down,ignoring them,or belittling them only makes them worse. \n\nThat's why outlets are needed. That's why you have to feel your emotions as they come versus pushing them away. However,that doesn't mean you act on them. It's a balancing act that takes years to master so don't feel inadequate when you try and fail sometimes. \n\nI'd request therapy so your therapist can help guide you in your journey as a teen. They will also be able to help you in your new situation and the emotional aspects.",
            "Mason, the fact that you're able to recognize and effectively express these emotions at your age is very impressive. You're in an emotionally intense and confusing situation, but I genuinely believe you'll do fine. Not only do you seem (frankly absurdly) emotionally mature, your parents both seem happy to discuss and support you in these matters. You sound great, man, I wish you all the best. Sorry you're having to go through this.",
            "I call bullshit on this for one. When I was 14 I couldn\u2019t text a girl using proper grammar let alone spill out this eloquent and well documented thread. This guy is definitely a 30 year old man with nothing better to do. I mean come on. His account is 19 days old and it\u2019s history is literally just about this specific situation plus a sob story about a best friend of his coming out of the closet. Get a life Mason, if that really is your name.",
            "I just wanna give you a hug. You sound so mature about everything and your feelings are totally normal.  As long as you can talk openly with your parents I think you will be fine.  Talk things out on here too because lots of people have been in your shoes.  Good luck",
            "Everything you are feeling is 100% normal, and you are very mature to be able to state how you feel and how you are experiencing this situation. When I was nine, my mom moved us in with a family that would soon become our step family and it was hard because I remember I felt like I was invading their space and it was hard having lost my previous life and then suddenly having to share EVERYTHING even my mom. My brother had the exact sad realization as you and he felt surprised by it as well, that our parents would never get back together. It felt so final, that this was our life now. Your parents sound pretty open and loving. Keep communicating with them and let them know what they are doing right and also tell them what's hard for you. Keep telling them your worries. You sound like a great kid with a lot to bring to this new family.",
            "Literally I have been through this. It\u2019s okay to have an issue with this. It\u2019s a rapid transition in your life and talk to your dad about it. I went through the same thing with my dad and his girlfriend and we never talked about how hard it was for me. He will understand",
            "Hi Mason,\n\nLike everyone else said already, you are showing tons of great maturity and self-reflection! It's really impressive.\n\nYour age is a time of tons of weird emotions and reactions to things. I felt like I was on an emotional rollercoaster (sometimes still do, and I'm 25 now) at your age, so that's totally normal and won't stay like that forever. But staying in touch with your emotions and accepting them, then letting them go will help you a lot now and in the future. Never bottle them in or feel ashamed though! You have lots of supportive people around you that you can talk to.\n\nOne thing about jealousy that I noticed for myself: everytime I felt bad or jealous or unhappy, I would withdraw more from other people. But then that made my bad feelings worse! So that withdrawing created a negative spiral that only made me feel worse and separated me from people more. I know it feels uncomfortable, but if you try to spend time there and work through the uncomfortable feeling, that's how you will get close to everyone who spends more time together.\n\nBest of luck! You're doing great so far : )",
            "Man I wished I had half of the emotional intelligence you\u2019re displaying at twice your age! You\u2019ll live in a lot of new and different places with new people over the years. the transition can be alien feeling (hell i\u2019m in a weird headspace because my gym got reorganized). As long as you communicate and are patient with the weirdness you\u2019ll adjust just fine. Also don\u2019t worry about inside jokes too much new ones will emerge in no time. I\u2019ve found it\u2019s better to ask someone about the joke later one on one(it\u2019s a good way to bond) if you\u2019re really curious rather than immediately but that\u2019s just my two cents.",
            "I am going to echo what a lot of people have already said, but I wanna say it anyway.  Your ability to articulate how you feel and share those feelings with people who love and value you is really great. Your feelings are so so valid and I'm sorry that you have to deal with them at all.  That said, it wouldn't hurt to talk to a therapist, only if to learn more healthy ways to cope and stay open and communicative with everybody.  Take good care of yourself, Mason. \ud83d\udc99",
            "Mason, you sound wise beyond your years. Your writing is highly articulate and you seem like a great dude all around.",
            "You are such a sweet boy. I can't imagine them thinking anything differently than I do.\n\nMy suggestion would be to take a one on one day with his girlfriend. Get to know her more, it will make you feel comfortable. Also, spend more one on one with her son, who knows, it may start to seem like he could be an older brother figure.\n\nNow, let me be straight, your relationship with your dad will change, but not in a bad way. You can still be just as close, but now he's got to split a little time between all of you, he's settling into this just like you are, regardless of how much time he spent at their last house.\n\nThe jealousy shouldn't last, as long as he is intentionally making time for you as well. Of course it's hard at first, awkward even. You've only seen him with one person your entire life, a person you adore. This will take getting used to, but eventually you are going to feel comfortable enough to relax and maybe even make some mistakes. I mean, she raised a boy your age, she knows you won't be a perfect angel all the time. It's your job to mess up.",
            "Wow, Mason. Gotta say you are handling this so well! Your self-awareness is on point, and while your feelings may not seem rational, you are able to see logically that you should get past them. Keep in mind that you're at an age where your emotions are difficult to control as it is. With the new situation, it's certainly no surprise that you are having trouble navigating everything. However, you are doing absolutely fine, it seems. The undesired feelings will become easier to moderate as you get used to things and find your groove. Truly, you've got a better grip on yourself than most adults. So feel good about that. The rest will come. :)",
            "This is so important. There are so many men out there who let their partners run everything and they don't talk about what they need, speak up, or insist on a fair shake. I don't want you to grow up like that, Mason.\n\nYou're not being treated fairly. Can you notice that? Can you feel it? That hurt, anger, sadness, or discomfort that you feel is a sign that things aren't right. You're being left out and it made me sad.\n\nYou gotta learn to speak up and insist. It made me so sad to read that you thought you had to learn to be more self-reliant. No! That's not right. Tell all of them how you feel. I know you British people never talk about feelings sincerely, but you should try.\n\n> I feel I need to be on my best behaviour at all times and am constantly not wanting to offend intentionally\n\nThat sounds horrible. Sounds somewhat abusive. That's not right. You gotta talk to them about this and please don't think you have to always be on guard.",
            "Keep an open dialogue with your dad.",
            "Like everyone has mentioned, it's great that you are being level headed and expressing your emotions and thoughts about this situation you are going through, instead of bottling it up.\n\n I am actually dating a dad that has 3 teen daughters, I have no kids of my own, nor want to have any (of my own).  We have been taking our relationship super slow because of the girls. Our biggest worry is what his daughters would think of his relationship with me. We want his girls to feel like they are important, and his relationship with me is never going to change that. They have accepted and like me now, and see how happy I make their dad. I care about them because they are a massive part of my boyfriend's life. I have not moved in with him yet, but worry how they would feel when this eventually happens. \n\nThe reason why I am bringing this up is that they are probably just as worried as you are, about how you would feel and be affected by their relationship, and them moving in together.  The good thing is that you get on with your dad's girlfriend and her son. And that your dad still loves and cares about you, he still wants you to be a part of his family. Change is very scary, I get that. It takes time to get used to things.\n\nI think it will work out eventually for you, as they all seem to care about you. Keep up the comminication, tell them all your thoughts and worries. You should also have a one on one talk with your dad's girlfriend, tell her how you feel, as I'm sure she wants you to feel like you fit in too.\n\nI'm not sure if this helps though.",
            "Sounds like your Dad is your ally. Just text him this.",
            "Like so many others here I am thoroughly impressed with your emotional intelligence. You are getting used to a new normal; we as people tend to gravitate to the known and familiar, find comfort in it. You are very open-minded and self aware, so I am confident you will weather this just fine until you no longer have need to weather it. It will just be normal. \n\nIt sounds like your dad, his girlfriend, and her son are all very caring and supportive people, and your mother sounds wonderful too. You are a very lucky young man, Mason.",
            "I was around your age, just a little older, when my parents split up, and settling into a new dynamic was very challenging.  It\u2019s hard to change your routine when you\u2019re a teenager and already used to things being one way. However, now over 10 years later, I have both my parents and now a wonderful new step family that does feel like family. It sounds like they are good people. I\u2019m sure you will feel this way in the future as well. Something that is hard to come to terms with is that your parents aren\u2019t perfect. It sounds logical, but as you grow and gain life experience, you really realize it. You will find that you may disagree more and more with your parents, things they may have done, or how they do things. And I\u2019m not talking about abuse or anything, just normal everyday things or lifestyles that you just don\u2019t agree with. And that\u2019s okay. Your parents are human, flawed humans, but it sounds like good humans. The choices your parents make, right or wrong, influence you as their kid, and sounds like your dad is just trying to navigate the situation the best that he can. If you have this level of insight and awareness of your own feelings at 14, I have no doubt you will do just fine not only in this situation but also in life. Good luck!",
            "For a 14 year old you are rediculously mature and level headed. \n\nI sincerely hope your dad continues to work with you and make an effort. I\u2019d be incredibly proud if I was him.",
            "After reading your posts, and scrolling some of the comments, I wanted to make a suggestion that may help you become more comfortable with your dad and his new living arrangements.\n\nYou said you've stayed with your dad for 'a few days'. But it also sounds like you're ready to run back to your mom's house pretty quickly. You also noticed the ease your dad and his girlfriend and her son have with each other and surmised that they've spent time together. I think you're right.\n\nI also realized you are suffering anxiety and it seemed you are cutting your visits with them short, or at least keeping a 'one foot out the door' mentality. \n\nAt any rate, my suggestion is that as soon as the opportunity arises, you try to spend a *longer* stretch with them, a week or more. The reason for that can be found in the old saying, \"Fish and guests both stink after 3 days.\"\n\nYou feel like a guest because you haven't been around these new people long enough to get comfortable around them. After 3 days, the newness wears off, the routine becomes more obvious, people let their guards down, and are more at ease with one another. \n\nThe other side of this is that when small disagreements arise, instead of being the 'polite guest' or 'polite host,' after the first 3 or 4 days, people will stop covering those up and start expressing them. Just be aware that you have to do it in a way that doesn't hurt or insult the other party.\n\nThis is normal. Even with family I've known all my life, if I'm visiting someone I haven't seen or really talked to in months, long-distance visits take a little time to relax into. No matter how well you know someone, the routine in their home just takes time, as does getting comfortable enough to be honest rather than polite.\n\nI think you're being very thoughtful and introspective. Don't try to over-analyze too much, but put some thought into making a longer visit and keep a journal of how you're feeling each day. It could go a long way towards easing this transition for everyone, and it sounds like they want it to work as much as you do.\n\nGood luck to all of you!",
            "I\u2019m a stepmom myself and you sound very thoughtful and all of your feelings are totally fair. I\u2019ve been very lucky with my steps who just welcomed me and appreciated me. Obviously through hard work on my part, but also from my now husband. I think you should communicate with your father how you feel. Don\u2019t be afraid to sound weird or do something wrong. Be open with him about your feelings. And if you can, ask for help to not be the guest. Tell him that sometimes it\u2019s overwhelming and you might need time for yourself but you do want to be included. I\u2019m sure it feels weird now but you could even try to talk to his girlfriend about it. She sounds like she would care and make the effort. It truly sounds like they all want to get along and for you to be part of the family unit there is at your fathers place.",
            "You\u2019re really so cool! 14-year olds usually doesn\u2019t have the same emotional maturity and reflection you do (some adults doesn\u2019t even have that!).\n\nAnyways, I get why you\u2019re feeling jealous. It must feel like you were blindsided by how close they all are. But if you look at this from your Dad\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s a very good thing that he and your new step sibling is close - makes for less friction in your new household. Creating a good relationship with his girlfriend\u2019s son may have been something he figured would make the transition easier! So while you have been at your mom\u2019s house, your Dad may have been trying hard to make all of this easier on you by spending extra time with them. I think that\u2019s really wise! \n\nThe good news is - inserting yourself in their dynamic will be easier than you think! The more time you spend with them, the easier it will be - especially with that mature and stable head of yours. You go man!",
            "Talk to your Dad. Every single thing you've said in this post, you should be talking to your Dad about. He already knows something is wrong, and he's probably assuming it's a lot worse than it is - you don't want to see him, you don't like his new gf, etc. He will understand your concerns and feelings, and talking to him about it gives him an opportunity to help you.",
            "I just want to add, dont forget your just a kid. While I get you want to treat it like an adult, your feelings are all completely valid and normal. It's ok to be confused. Maybe ask your dad if you can share all this with him and that you love him but you just are finding it hard this time.\n\nThat really is the straight of it. We ALL need to let ourselves feel our feelings it's ok to be upset, frustrated and confused and scared. \n\nTrying to forget about them and being an adult really usually just bites us adults in the ass anyway. \n\nYou're doing great Mason. Trust yourself. You're completely worth it. \n\n\nFrom a kid.... just 20 years older",
            "Ah yes, the new wife's house. My step dad and mom divorced and he quickly remarried. They bought a house and she had a son (previous marriage) who loved with them and my sister lives with them too. I constantly felt like a guest. As a child, it was super hard. \n\nIn their dynamic, I was like a second class citizen. When I got older, I realized it wasn't ever about me, but totally about them. Thankfully I never really stayed over or I probably would have felt real weird. \n\nEnjoy this time with your dad. Itll be ok.",
            "It took me many more years than you to become emotionally  mature, and I've developed a mantra that helps keep me that way: ***You have to push your feelings out and not down.***\n\nYou can't control how you feel, only how you react to it. When these negative feelings come up whether you feel they are rational or not, you have to push them out (express them in a constructive way) instead of push them down (repress them.) \n\nKeeping negative feelings in is a bit like putting a t shirt in a drawer. You fold it up and put it away bc you don't want to bother other people with them. But it stays there inside of you. Every time you do this, you're adding another shirt to the drawer and eventually it's going to be too full and they're going to all come tumbling out, not neatly folded anymore, but just a big pile of feelings that cause an outburst. \n\nSpeak to your dad about the things that bother you. Explain to him calmly that you really appreciate what they're doing to make you feel welcome but that you have a few concerns. If the thought makes you feel uncomfortable and you don't think you can say everything you need to say, write it in a letter. The difference between constructive criticism and complaining is offering a solution. List the things that bother you, and a potential way to solve them. You may not get your way on each thing, life is full of compromise, but expressing yourself and feeling heard goes a long way in making you feel better. Then your drawer stays empty and you don't build resentment.\n\nOverall I think you are handling this great and you're more mature than a lot of boys twice your age. Your parents did a good job with you so I'm confident that they are mature enough to address your concerns without escalating it into an argument. Good luck, you got this!",
            "Hello from a child of divorced parents! My parents divorced when I was maybe 10, and both remarried and divorced since then aswell. I just wanted to tell you that this feeling of not fitting in will pass, you pretty much just need to get used to the new situation (as it is a new situation it is natural to feel out of tune). I would recommend if possible to even stay for maybe 2 weeks to be able to feel like you can sync in with the new normal.",

            "I don\u2019t have any advice for your situation. You seem really on top of this and way wiser than your years. Just wanted to let you know I\u2019m rooting for you and I hope that you are able to find your place within the new family dynamic. All the best to you!",

But there really isn't a good way for you to cultivate a relationship with both parents otherwise.\n\n\nOn one hand, you still have both parents accessible to you.  It sounds like your Dad is giving you love and attention.   Feeling like a \"guest\" is just cause you live there less frequent than everyone else - but that is still a home for you.\n\n\nMy suggestion would be to try and get to know the girlfriend and her son a little better, it sounds like they are willing.   The more you develop those relationships that feeling of everyone else having inside jokes will go away.  \n\n\nBut also try to be upfront with your dad.  Let him know you are struggling, but that you appreciate his efforts.  It sounds like if there are things that can help get you over this hump he would be willing to contribute towards that.\n\nGood luck!",
            "Hey Mason!  \n\nI'm kind of late to this conversation but I wanted to give you a different perspective. I didn't have to go through what you are going through but I married a man who had kids from a previous marriage and became a step mom.   It can be awkward on both sides!   \n\nFrom my experience I fell in love with my husband and that included everything about him including his special bond with his kids.  They are an extension of him and what makes him the wonderful person I see in him.   But how do you create a relationship without overstepping boundaries?  If you become too friendly maybe you will be more lenient than dad and they can use you to get away with stuff.  Or maybe you can follow dad's rules but what if that makes you seem too strict and mean.  Adults get confused with all the same stuff too!  \n\nWhat worked best is to find a way to relate on a personal level.  Maybe a shared interest that doesn't include dad or step brother, some sort of \"special\" activity that the two of you can share and create your own \"in jokes\".  It takes time to establish a friendship.  But getting to know her as a person and more than just Dad's girlfriend can help both of you. \n\nWe've all heard the horror stories of evil stepmoms, but it sounds like she's trying her best to make you part of the family.  Just remember she loves your dad and wants the best for him, which means she wants the best for you, too.  \n\nAnd keep speaking up about your feelings.

Essentially, you're part of two loving, supportive families, and that will definitely benefit you.

            "I'll start by saying I have no direct experience with blended families, but I do have experience with changing living situations.  You are doing great.  It does feel weird for a bit, that's normal.  All your daily routines have to change at least a bit, because things like your comb is in the drawer to the left instead of the right now.  Also different houses have different sounds, they shift differently in the wind, \n\nI was so excited to move to college and live in a dorm at 17, but I was also nervous.  So nervous, in fact, that I threw up my breakfast that morning.  And drove down with a bucket in the passenger seat of the car in case it happened again.  I got my first apartment at 25.  Again I was super excited, but it felt so weird there, and I felt so on display, even after I got curtains.  It was scary being all alone at night too.  Same again when we got our house when I was 29.\n\nIt takes time, but it will be home sooner than you think.  Generally it takes about a week to settle into a new routine.  Longer if it's an intermittent routine.  It sounds like your whole family (mom, dad, acting stepmom, acting stepbrother) are understanding and supportive.  That's huge.  Change is a fact of life, experience is something you get right *after* you need it, new situations are always a bit nerve-wracking.  You are doing fine.\n\nAlso keep in mind you are the right age to be hitting puberty.  That surge of hormones could be the cause of, or heavily contributing to your emotional turmoil.",

He must be freaking out and have been so scared and stressed to have worked so hard for so long. I'm HAPPY he messed up. It means he TRUSTS ME. It means he has faith that he doesnt have to be perfect, he can just be another kid in the house, being good most of the time, great here and there and a saucy little monkey here and there without it meaning he isnt loved or accepted.\"\n\nEven as an adult, just moving into a new place, even one you love so much you signed up for a decade or two's worth of most of your money going into it makes you feel all this stuff. Even if you're all alone, you get your own dishes for dinner out feeling almost like youre overstepping in someone else's house.

And you struggle to rationally explain the jealousy so you blame yourself for it, it feels irrational to you because you see him making an effort to spend time with just you. But you understand on some level that he schedules this time with you specifically so you won't feel left out. It's not the same as inherently being on the inside. You don't feel like you're in his life, you feel like a guest in his life. I think the term for this feeling is \"abandonment\"\n\nAlso feeling like you have to walk on eggshells because it isn't your home. That's a shitty feeling, it's important to have a sense of comfort in your own home, space to be yourself unrestrained. These are strangers to you. They're being nice to you, sure, but you don't know yet what will happen if you say rude things or if you leave clothes on the floor or if you spend too long in the bathroom. They're being so nice to you, you wonder how deep it goes and how long before they get real with you\n\nI think a lot of it will become more comfortable and familiar with time. You will eventually get to know these people and you will eventually drop all the pretense with them until they feel like your own family. That's just a matter of time spent with them and it will happen in it's own time, that's not something you have to hurry up. You don't have to \"get over\" feeling like an outsider, that's not just something you can make yourself do\n\nSelf reflection is good. Self honesty is good. Even jealousy is good, if you can awknowledge it and use it to introspect. Jealousy is like when you burn yourself on something hot; it hurts, but it lets you know when you've been hurt\n\nI'm sorry about all the change in your life. My parents were never together, I just had my mom and sometimes I read about what it's like to be coparented and it makes me feel some kind of way. Obviously it's two completely different experiences and can't be compared, but one thing I can relate to is the feeling of abandonment. I have a really strong sense of abandonment from my father and it's something I cope with underneath it all, a feeling I'm super familiar with. But having to go through what you're going through honestly sounds so much harder to me than just not having a dad in my life. I want you to understand that processing a sense of abandonment while the person that abandoned you is still around you must be some of the hardest grief to overcome. Any way that you feel about it is a totally normal part of the process",
            "I've experienced this before. A lot of the advice you're getting here is very good. Indeed, it will take time to get used to, but I've found some tricks that help since I've done this more than once when I was your age.   \n\n\n\\- Do some chores around the house. Seriously. I know it sounds weird, but it's a very quick way to help you feel more at home. Everyone is making sure that you're ok and that's fine. It's good that they care. But it can make you feel a bit helpless/like a victim. It did for me at least. Helping out around the house will not only make you feel less like a guest, but will also grant you some 'ownership' over the house. Not literally of course, but you'll get to know the new place. It's like a 'get to know you' between you and the house.   \n\n\n\\- Spend as much time in your new room as you need to. Adjusting to THE NEW ROOM is one of the hardest parts. Our rooms are very much our own safe little dens and you've been used to only having one for a long time. Having two rooms is burdensome because at first, you'll feel like one of them is a hotel. Eventually though, things will iron out like people here are saying. Having a safe little space that's your own is a big help.   \n\n\n\\- If you can see yourself being friends with your Dad's girlfriend's son, I say go for it. Right now your dad is the familiar person in this strange house, but he's still your dad. Having someone your age in the house is nice and if you have anything in common, this will help you feel like this new place is more 'home' and less 'hotel'. If you don't have much in common and wouldn't otherwise be friends, don't pressure yourself to be super tight. Just make sure you're on good enough terms to coexist peacefully and the rest will fall into place.   \n\n\n\\- Finally, DON'T FEEL PRESSURED TO STAY THERE. Your dad sounds like a nice, reasonable man. He has a lot of NEW in his life right now too. He will understand if you need some familiarity. If you want to go home, it might hurt his feelings a bit, but trust me when I say he won't take it personally from you. He's trying to balance his new life with his old life and while the new and shiny seems like it might take all his attention, remember that you're his son and the no. 1 most important thing in the whole world to him is you. Just don't do what I did and make sure your dad knows that it's not about him, it's just the circumstances and you need something familiar. If you plan on not staying for a more extended period, just make sure to call him or at least answer his calls every now and again. I didn't understand this when I was 15, but I realize now that just reassuring my dad that I loved him was more than enough to maintain the relationship when I was at my mom's. You might worry that he's moving on, but he's worried that he's pushing you out. Let him know that you're still you and your relationship with each other won't go anywhere!   \n\n\nIt might suck at first, but soon you have two christmases to look forward to, two rooms to put all your stuff, two everything!",
            "I can't speak on moving in with a step sibling or splitting time, but I can tell you I moved into my stepdad's house at about 10 with my mom and sister. My mom and him had dated for a little while, and up until then we were hopping between townhouse to townhouse as we were tight on money. For the first little while I was there it was *so* weird. I also felt like a guest and out of place, but I promise you you'll settle in, especially since you've got your own room.\n\nMay I suggest, if you don't already do this, cooking with them or helping out in other areas around the house that you may not normally do already? I mean yeah, it's chores, but helping out with some cooking or in the yard, like planting some plants, etc, may help you feel more at home and \"get to know\" the house. How things work, how everybody does these things, etc.\n\nFinally I would say maybe speak to a school counselor or your father about these feelings, or ask for a separate counselor/therapist if you continue to find these feelings hard to work out. It's a big life adjustment and sometimes people just can't handle the emotions and changes without some help. I think you're at a great place maturity wise for your age honestly! But don't feel like you have to bear this weight alone. Good luck, I believe in you!",
            "I haaaate to say puberty because people always say puberty, but your brain really is in development overdrive. Not to mention you're in the awkward area where you're not really a kid anymore, but also not an adult. You're asking adult questions about belonging examining your dad's relationship from the respectful position that an adult would... You have a lots of expectations of yourself to behave rationally and maturely like an adult, but at the same time you don't have the practice, the experience, the amount of control over your own life, or the freedoms that an adult has. It can feel very frustrating to have these expectations to behave like an adult, but not have the practice or the freedom.  Also, your brain being in development mode means that you're very \"aroused\" ( the version of the word that means you have  heightened senses and you're running at a higher RPM).  Running at a heightened state can make feelings more intense and situations feel like they're going to last forever, like you've got to hurry up and solve a problem... It can really cause all or nothing thinking, poor impulse control, less ability to have good judgements when it comes to risk.   \n\nYou're doing a really good job listening to your feelings, identifying them, and observing them before acting.  You're taking the time to ask why stuff feels like it does and really questioning the root and your doing an amazing job of viewing other people's actions with empathy.\n\nContinue journaling. Continue trying new ways to express yourself. Life can throw some REALLY BIG feelings our way and learning how to deal with them.. by identifying them and finding healthy ways to express them and live a life authentic to our feelings is a lifelong learning process.\n\nYou're doing a great job. It's really scary and lonely to be alive sometimes. That's okay. It doesn't mean that you don't fit in with the rest of us on this wild planet.",
            "TIME.  Time is the only way to get past issues.  You can't make yourself be ok with something that feels off.  All you can do is keep trying, and know that it's ok that you are uncomfortable, but keep pushing.  Sooner or later you'll stop feeling uncomfortable about everything and just enjoy the company of your dad.",
            "Ur mourning the loss of ur family now that this new normal had set in. The thing to keep in mind is that life is fluid like a river ever changing.",
            "EDIT (27/11/19) - I AM EXTREMELY TAKEN BACK BY ALL THE WONDERFUL AND SUPPORTIVE MESSAGES YOU GUYS AND GALS HAVE POSTED...\n\nI am sorry I have not responded yet but I have been so busy trying to take my mind off of this situation that I have barely has time to post on here. I promise I will reply soon. School journeys have been hard but are becoming more common if not demotivating. I still feel like a relative visiting. I have done chores as suggested but feel I have to do regular and daily chores so that I earn my place in the house, which I suppose is true to a degree. I still feel conflicted at seeing them together and know I need to keep trying but I just want to go back home to familiar surroundings when I am at my Dads new home."

        "selftext": "Hi everyone! Sorry it took so long to update but I was waiting for my post to get off the front page (I can't believe how popular it was!) and then I got bogged down with school stuff. But I'm here now! First off, here is the obligatory link to my previous post:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4fjg8a/a_girl_20sf_who_is_a_distant_acquaintance/\n\nSecond, thank you to everyone who responded, I can't believe so many people chimed in and posted back or PM'd. Thank you!\n\nSo...on to the dramatic conclusion!\n\nI took your advice and decided to tell Kelly what was going on. I texted her and said \"*Hey girl, very excited about your party and thank you for inviting me! I'm sorry to do this, but a few hours after I accepted your invitation I got this message from Vicky (screencap).*\n*I haven't spoken to Vicky in about a year and I really don't know what this is all about but I do know I don't want to cause any drama at your party. Would it be easier on you if I stayed away? I just want what works best for you.*\"\n\n15 minutes later I got a text from Kelly that said \"*WTF?!?*\"\n\nI started to text back but Kelly called me while I was typing. She was *pissed*\n\nKelly basically asked what Vicky's problem was and I told her I didn't know, she'd gone on one bad date with my brother a year ago and we didn't really hit it off as friends and this is the first time I'm hearing from her. I told Kelly I felt really bad and didn't want to cause any problems for her. \n\nKelly said \"I can't believe she has the *nerve* to try and uninvite people from *my* party. That message is so middle school! This is...oh my god I'm so mad! Quinoafan I have to go, I'm going to get to the bottom of this. I'm not mad at you, I'll get back to you I promise. I've got to sort this out.\"\n\nWell long story short Kelly called Vicky and basically ripped her a new one. Apparently (as told to me by Kelly) Vicky tried to act like she had no idea what Kelly was talking about until Kelly texted her the picture I took.\n\nVicky then said I had to be making it up and that I've been bullying and harassing and stalking her and that I'm a jerk, etc. She basically tried to make it look like I made it up, \"hacked\" into her account, and that I've always treated her like crap. She then said because I treat her so bad she didn't know why someone as awesome as Kelly would be my friend let alone want me at her party and that she (Vicky) could use her (Kelly's) support.\n\nKelly was having none of it. She basically said that she knew me and knew I would NEVER do something like that and also that even if I was that type of person there's no way I could know her information to get into her facebook. \n\nShe said that Vicky must think she's really stupid to try and pull that kind of bullshit on her and who the hell did she think she was trying to stir up this drama and tell people they couldn't come to her party? Kelly then said Vicky started crying and swearing she was telling the truth and why wouldn't Kelly believe her and why was she being a drama queen, etc.\n\nKelly promptly uninvited Vicky from the party and said they were no longer friends and that she couldn't believe how much of a jerk Vicky is. Kelly unfriended and deleted her from all social media.\n\nKelly called all her friends and asked if they had gotten similar messages from Vicky but no one had, so apparently Vicky actually had a personal problem with me and wasn't trying to just uninvite people for the hell of it. I'm still not sure why she fixated on me but that's life I guess.\n\nVicky started harassing Kelly and calling her names on the phone until Kelly blocked her. According to mutual friends Vicky is making posts on facebook about shallow girls and their drama and how the people closest to you always betray you etc.\n\nI didn't hear from Vicky again but I blocked her to be safe. I told my brother what happened and he just rolled his eyes and said he isn't the least bit surprised because \"Vicky is a fucking psycho and basket case.\"\n\nKelly treated me to coffee to make up for what happened to me even though I said there was nothing to apologize for but she insisted. We had a nice time even though Kelly was in a bad mood for a bit and angry she had thought Vicky was a friend and that she had known Vicky was a problem but she had compassion for her and felt everyone deserves a chance and mad that Vicky took advantage of that.\n\nI'm not surprised since Kelly is a really nice person but I cheered her up and Kelly is feeling much better now. She says I have to come to her party or she'll kick my butt and I promised I would be there.\n\nAll in all, there was some drama but it's over now and I'll be honest I feel a lot more relaxed that icky Vicky won't be there and that Kelly believed me right from the get go and didn't think I was trying to start drama. It actually felt really good that she never once doubted me and believed me from the start. I need to get more coffee with her.\n\nThanks Reddit for your help!\n\n**TL;DR Showed Kelly Vicky's message to me. Kelly got pissed and called out Vicky on her drama. Vicky lied and tried to say I've been bullying and harassing her and I hacked into her account. Kelly didn't believe her and Vicky is officially uninvited from the party and she and Kelly are no longer friends. Kelly is a better friend than I thought and I plan on going to her party and trying to be a better friend to her. All's well that ends well**",

        "selftext": "My situation is really weird. \n\n**Explanation:** I'm what the deaf (non-verbal audio) classify as Hard hearing (HH) because I can communicate with hearing person without resorting sign languages or notes. \n\nI met my boyfriend, \"Alan\", who is deaf about year ago. I was the only person he could communicate at work with ASL, even though I only could sign basic words. Later, he began to teach me in more advanced ASL and we found out we have so much in common in tv, movies, books tastes with similar goals and desires in life that we became best friends that evolved into a romantic relationship. We're going strong nine months now and we're compatible in every area. It's the best and healthiest relationship I ever had and I'm always excited and giddy to see him at work or when we wake up together. He feels the same and we're talking moving each other as soon his lease is up in three months from now.  \n\nTwo months ago, we decided to meet each other parents which all are hearing (he's their only deaf son). Alan met mine and it went fabulous. Then we met his parents, \"Irma\" and \"Paul\". \n\nI thought we got along because they were smiling, gushing and laughing but I'm beginning to believe they were putting their best masks for the sake of their son. One time on a family's bday parties, Irma said in front of the ladies with me next to her, \"It's so impressive you can talk with that speech impediment. I barely can understand you myself.\" She said as jokingly manner but no one laughed, everyone glanced at each other awkwardly and I just stared at her, then excused myself. At first I wasn't sure if she meant as generational-ignorant way like \"who's the woman in the relationship?\" to the gays. I didn't mention to my boyfriend because I was hoping it was only time remark.\n\nIt wasn't. They made more comments, mostly Irma, about me struggling pronunciation or grammars, using sign language incorrectly and not teaching me the right one like Alan would do, or not having deaf/HH friends or not going more to deaf community and so on. It happened so gradual and subtle that I didn't realize they were being insulting to my face that to this day I still wonder. Most of the time they would make those comments without Alan nearby. I mentioned to Alan few times and he told me that maybe they were worried I might not understand the deaf culture. He talked to them that saying those things weren't helpful and he would appreciate if they would shut it up. They didn't.  \n\nFew weeks ago at bbq party, Irma and Paul sort of insinuated about my parent for not giving best tool for me, saying it was a shame that my parent didn't put me in deaf school or letting me to get cochlea implant or letting me to study aboard in non-deaf university program. They made it sound as if my parent crippled me as person because my social and emotional network didn't consist the \"right\" people. This time I got angry and I said what they said was rude, that my parents made lot sacrifice for me and no one has the right to belittle for their choices about raising me. Alan caught at the end of the conversation (lipreading) and asked me what's going on. Not so surprisingly, Alan's parent threw me under the bus, remarking I was so sensitive after making such innocuous comment. Alan saw I was uncomfortable and asked me if I want to leave. I said yes and we left, when we got home he asked me what they said to me. I didn't want to say what his parent told me because it was so ugly to talk about it but I told him anyway and he got upset for me. He face-timed them and said they shouldn't said that. He told them they crossed the line. They pretended they didn't know what I was talking about, that perhaps I misunderstood, considering I'm \"hard hearing\" which upset Alan even more. They ended arguing for few minute before Alan hung up. \n\nSince then, Alan has become desolate and needy. He apologized to me hundred of times for not believing me what I said before. I told them that he has nothing to apologize because I wasn't sure if they were being snide toward me until now and I'm not going to blame Alan for what his parent said to me. He told me he's thinking reducing contact with them but I told Alan it wasn't necessary. He can do whatever he wants with his parent but that I rather would not go to any of his family gathering or go his parent's. He assured he would never force me or put me in that situation ever again. \n\nWe're closer together than we were but he's still sad and he no longer goes to his family gatherings or his parent's. I find him staring at nothing in particular for long minutes and his eyes which used to sparkle are now dim. I want to cheer him up but I'm not so sure how to in first place. I just don't know what to do and I don't understand why his parents are so rude toward me because I'm not \"completely\" deaf considering they aren't one!\n\nWhat I can do? \n\n**TL;DR** : My SO's parent (hearing) doesn't like me because I'm (Hard Hearing) not completely deaf like he is. SO found out and he's upset. ",

            "He's 35 and his family has essentially kept him isolated with the kind of passive aggressive tactics they used on you.  It's entirely natural that he would mourn their ability to be happy for him.\n\nLet him work on the changing the dynamic with his family as he goes.  He shouldn't cut them out completely, just withdraw a bit.   If he wants to attend a family event, discuss it and decide what's best in the specific situation.\n\nYou are probably the best thing that ever happened to him too.  Keep that in mind as you deal with his parents and extended family.",
            "I think your boyfriend is being a really stand up guy!  I'm glad that he supports you and doesn't defend his parents when they treat you poorly.  \n\nI think you are doing a great job of being kind to him about his parents while still maintaining boundaries that make you feel comfortable.  If he is still choosing to limit his contact with them, even when you say it's not offensive to you that he go to see them, I would think it's because he's angry at their behavior and not just angry because you're upset.  He agrees with you that their behavior was unacceptable.   He's probably upset too because it's hard to see you parents do mean, rude, or cruel things to other people.   Him being bummed out that his parents suck (in this particular case) isn't your fault at all but it's still a bummer for your boyfriend.  \n\nI would just continue the relationship as normal.  Maybe surprise your boyfriend with a small treat, favor, or something if you want to cheer him up, but don't make a huge drama about that.  If you have to see the parents in the future for some unavoidable reason, grey-rock them.  Avoid it when you can though, which you said you were planning to do.  ",
            "I suspect this is a bit like religious converts.\n\nWhen they had Alan they decided to bring him up a certain way and \"bought in\" to that way as the one true way.\n\nNow you show up having followed a different way and doing well for yourself. The cognitive dissonance is off the charts. The only way to cope is to undeemine and attack you, prove to themselves they were right and you were wrong. \n\nWhat they're doing is similar to what cultists and the super religious do when their belief system is challenged. You might find good advice in the literature for dealing with it.",

What his mom is doing sounds like gatekeeping - judging who gets to say they belong and who is just a poser.",
            "(Backstory, I'm a CODA with a deaf mom, brother and sister) \n\nUgggh, the fact that they're shaming you for not running in all deaf circles when they're hearing is bullshit. \n\nYou are perfect just the way you are!!! \n\nMy mom and brother are deaf and don't even involve themselves in deaf culture because they don't want to, that doesn't make them any less of anything!!!  My siblings went to a mainstream school... nothing wrong with that either.  \n\nI love that your guy is helping you with sign language,  it's always nice to learn more, and at the hands of someone non judgemental and caring.  \n\nI could definitely imagine your guy is heartbroken over how terrible his folks are being to you... he loves you. I hope he finds his sparkle again soon.  ",
            "Ugh this is why I have issues with the parents of disabled people so often (I'm disabled). This is a pretty common thing, where non-disabled parents develop this sense of gatekeeping on their kid's (whether grown or child) disability.....including having NO problem insinuating or outright saying they know better than other disabled people.\n\n(I hope you dont find it offensive for me to use disabled to refer to you, since you're HH.

            "Do you two have any other Deaf friends who you could ask for advice on this? I'm not part of the Deaf community (just taken an ASL class) but from what I understand Deaf culture/community/education is a huge deal because for so long people tried to force folks like your boyfriend to be like hearing people in unnecessary and forceful ways. So in response to that now, there is a strong community of people who push back on anything that remotely feels like that forced assimilation. Like Alan's parents who think your parents did you a disservice by \"forcing\" you to assimilate by getting cochlear implants or go to a hearing-majority school. Neither of your parents are wrong, they just made different choices for their kids. The problem seems to be two fold: his parents don't respect your parents decisions so as a result they don't respect you, and his parents view you as a breach of his Deaf identity, which they seem to have adopted for themselves too. I think you should talk to others who have maybe been through something similar. I'm not sure if there are any subreddits who can help you with this.\n\nPerhaps both of you making a big deal out of this and explaining what damage they are doing to their relationship with their son will help. Perhaps not. But I think they're scared of change and see you as an intruder and you two need to either make them realize you aren't an intruder, or lower contact with them. Alan seems to have realized this but it takes time to process. I think you just need to be there for him and let him redesign his relationship with his parents as he sees fit. ",

            "None of this is either his or your fault. He's probably upset with himself because his parents were his heroes and it hit him that they are regular people. Unfortunately he is going to have to come to terms with it himself, ideally by talking to his parents and getting them to understand why what they were saying was wrong.  This may or may not work at which point he will have to lay down the law and tell them either they respect you or he stays away. It's unfortunate, he seems like he really loves and respects his parents, but they obviously don't respect his choices.",

            "Wow I am so sorry you have had to put up with these toxic people. My circumstances were totally different but my boyfriends (now husband) mother would say totally inappropriate things to me all of the time when he was out of the room. It got to the point that when we visited her I would insist that he never leave my side.  It has taken years but she has stopped with the negative comments. He did have to have more than one conversation with her over the years to establish boundaries with her.  Good luck moving forward. At some point couples have to separate themselves from their family units prioritize their new unit. Just keep the communication open with your boyfriend. ",

            "He's sad because he trusted his parents with someone he loved, and they turned round and hurt you, belittled you, made you uncomfortable on purpose. He's realising that his parents are not necessarily the nice, polite, supportive people he believed they were. It's not about you. Therapy may well be a good way to help him get some emotional clarity on the whole issue.",
            "I\u2019m going to take a slightly different tactic than some of these posts. I think this has more to do with your \u201cspeech impediment\u201d than your level of deafness. I say that in quotes because I don\u2019t want you think I\u2019m slamming your speech, but that your boyfriends mom clearly views it as an \u201cimpediment\u201d in the worst way. \n\nAll her slamming and shaming isn\u2019t a self righteous attempt to say you should have fully joined the deaf community - it\u2019s to slam you for speaking differently. You\u2019re allowed to be deaf, you\u2019re not allowed to sound different than them, thereby making it apparent that you have a disability. \n\nI guess what I\u2019m getting at is, I think this is coming from a nastier place than just being about deaf versus HH. And your boyfriend is sad becuase it hurts to know your parents are capable of thinking that way about anyone with a disability, let alone someone he cares for so much.\n\nTherapy would likely be a great step. For now, try to be as supportive to him as you can - his parents have let both of you down massively and he\u2019s probably seen this ugly side of them or the first time.",
            "It doesn\u2019t even matter what they think or have against you, because it isn\u2019t rooted in fact and likely makes no logical sense. Your boyfriend was faced with the hard reality that his parents aren\u2019t happy for him. They embarrassed him and have really shown an ugly side to themselves. He is going to be upset, of course.\n\nEncourage him to keep socializing and to keep engaging in his community. I doubt he is the only dead person to find themselves in a situation like this, and he may regain his sense of family and belonging by talking this out with other deaf friends. He sounds like he truly loves you and is very strong for believing you and accepting the ugly truth about his parents. I believe things will get better with time, too. He is probably reevaluating quite a lot right now.",

It\u2019s super uncomfortable when I\u2019ve interacted with Deaf people about my parents\u2019 choices. I feel for you. I think that capital D Deaf people take it as a personal insult when people don\u2019t choose to be in that culture. Perhaps his parents are lashing out because they\u2019re insecure about their own choices. Making comments about your speech is cruel though. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not forced to spend time with them. ",
            "I'd guess that Alan's basically having a period of mourning over who he thought his parents were.  He thought the love they extended to him also extended to the people he chose to give his love to, and subsequently supporting the choices he made in cementing himself a happy life, and now he's finding out this ugly fact about them sabotaging his efforts.\n\nHe might also be doing a lot of reassessment of his past experiences.  On top of what they did to you, this might not be the first time they've attempted to drive others away from him, perhaps successfully.\n\nI think you've done what you can for now.  You've let him know that you're fine with him maintaining a relationship with his parents while also giving yourself a boundary for the sake of your own mental health.  I'd assume you've let him know that he is always welcome to talk to you about how he's doing, either for advice or just to have a listening ear.

            "You\u2019ve gotten the recommendation to post on r/deaf, which would absolutely be helpful for your particular situation, but I would also like to recommend r/JUSTNOMIL. They have so much experience dealing with these kind of women, that even in your particular situation they would be able to offer help. It\u2019s also an incredibly validating and supporting community, so you would be in great hands with them. \n\nI suggest them because despite your unique hard-of-hearing and deaf situation, you are absolutely dealing with a JUSTNO. By this I mean your MIL is deliberate in her treatment of you, with the express intent of eliminating you in her son\u2019s life so she may usurp your position. She is trying to prove to her son that you are a detriment to his life, while showing herself to be everything he needs in womanly companionship. Yes it\u2019s as weird as it sounds, and yes it will be hard to handle and deal with, but this is why the residents of r/JUSTNOMIL will be very helpful to you, because this type of special behavior from JustNoMILS/JustNoMoms is their speciality. \n\nI can see this in just this simple background you\u2019ve given me. I\u2019m honestly surprised no one has given you this advice yet. \n\nShe is actively diminishing your role in her son\u2019s life by criticizing the difference in your two\u2019s hearing. She is trying to instill in him that since you hear a little more than him, you couldn\u2019t possibly relate to his situation, and thus would be unable to support him in any future situations. She does this by saying rude things when her son can\u2019t interpret, then pretending you\u2019ve misunderstood: \u201cOh how can you even take what\u2019s she\u2019s saying seriously, she can barely hear. She doesn\u2019t even know proper sign language, how are we supposed to talk to her, she can barely talk to you, at least *I* can communicate with you.\u201d \n\nYou not attending family functions is absolutely the right choice for you. However, if he still attends, he is rewarding her behavior. He is telling her \u201cYour behavior with my girlfriend doesn\u2019t matter to me, because I will always be here without her to see you anyway\u201d which is exactly what she wants. To get you away from him so she can have him all to herself. \n\nHearing about his attitude towards you since this latest incident is encouraging. He understands that what his mother is doing is not okay, and he\u2019s showing you he stands by you, and will defend you to his parents. That is invaluable in the battle you two will face against her. Yes he\u2019s going to face an uphill battle fighting his parents on something as basic as his own right to choose his partner and taking control of his own life as an adult, and it is going to be fucking ROUGH (pardon my Polish), and he might have moments of weakness, but the fact he\u2019s already standing up for you shows you two have the ability to weather this.

            "I think that he is trying to consolidate the possibility that you and his parents wont get along and is worried that it will effect the relationship. I think that you should reassure him in a more firm and direct way that regardless of how his parents are, your view of him wont change (as I think that could be what he is worried about). Even then if that is not the case, telling him to do whatever and to not worry about you in terms of interacting with his parents is probably putting more stress on him than you realize, solving this issue is something you both need to commit to, because at this point he might feel like he has to solve this on his own and that's could be another reason why he looks so distraught.",

Even if you guys broke up, the fact remains that they chose to insult you effectively behind his back and lie to his face about it.

I'm sorry they can't behave themselves.\n\nEdit: They clearly don't understand Deaf culture, honestly, because thinking you should have had a cochlear implant is incredibly offensive, not even touching the conversations around your boyfriend that mainly leave him out. Lipreading is *exhausting* and unreliable and I would expect his family & friends to sign heavily. It's so much more comfortable and the communication is so much better.\n\nThey most likely just think being HH & Deaf is a bad thing and honestly that makes them Grade A Assholes.",

            "Lots of good insight here. Let me add the thought that perhaps it has less to do with your level of hearing than it appears. His Mother be one of those who thinks no one is good enough for their precious child, or who had a good relationship with the wife and resents her being replaced, or who poured alot of energy into helping their differently abled child and still wants to protect/ manage the world around him by trying to vet the people around him, or simply are straight up snobs who have decided that you are below his social status. \n\nNone of that excuses the behavior you describe, just suggesting that they were so invested in their child they may see that as an area of expertise and are questioning your relationship passively-aggressively by nit-picking this aspect of you. Like they know better to make a direct attack on some other aspect of you but feel like undermining your confidence this way gives plausible deniability. Does that make sense? \n\nWhich means nothing that you or he did is the problem, of that you or he need to fix it. His sadness is appropriate, and necessary to processing the realizatons he is having about his parents. You neither caused nor need to take away his feelings. Just be there for him and love and support him and let him figure out what he needs to do to balance out this reality going forward.\n\nI had a dysfunctonal upbringing of the garden variety and was very aware of the fact from an early age that my Mother had issues (narcissist) but it wasnt until I was an adult that I started recognizing the dynamics of other family members, and even later after I had my own children that I realised that half of my \u201cnice\u201d \u201cchristian\u201d family were racist, bigoted, manipulative people who put up a good front but whose love was conditional. Realising that caused me to have some bitterness and to grieve the loss of the family that I though I had. Grief has stages, and takes as long as it takes for each individual. This situation may have resulted if grief for your SO. Read up a little bit on that, and supporting someone in a time of grief, and see if that feels authentic for you to apply here. Best wishes.",

Either way I think he's doing a great job in supporting you and showing that the relationship is important enough that he's willing to put his parents in their place. Going no contact for a little while may be the fallout they need to stop being gatekeeping assholes, and will probably also benefit Alan in the long run with future relationships even if you guys don't work out.",
            "The people at r/JUSTNOMIL are awesome and can help both of you cope.

He\u2019s going to have mourn the relationship he wished he had and what he now knows isn\u2019t going to happen. Maybe a lot of stuff with his ex is now making sense to him.\n\nDeaf culture can be really weird. I went to a Christian college and learned a little ASL. My church had a deaf ministry with interpreters during services who stood to the side in front of a section of pews and allowed our deaf members to sing and be a real part of the service and church. The deaf members were so happy for anyone who made an effort to communicate. It didn\u2019t happen a lot other than smiles and handshakes. (I once helped a woman at my job at a wallpaper store with a mix of signing and taking notes. The woman cried and wrote a thank you note to my boss because nobody else in the area tried to help. I thought that was so sad thst no one else was willing to help by just communicating by written notes. It wasn\u2019t difficult or more time consuming, even though I could only spell and use a few ASL signs.)\n\nAt the Christian college I attended, there was this ministry fair with booths where people could find out about different missions and ministries. One was a deaf church. The pastor approached me and started talking to me about his ministry. I said that my church had a deaf ministry. He started yelling at me about how horrible that was, and deaf people should have their own churches and not intermix with the hearing. How deafness wasn\u2019t a disability, and we couldn\u2019t understand. The deaf members at my church were always so happy when hearing members tried to communicate, no matter how badly. Everyone in this large room was looking at us. I really wanted to point out the irony and hypocrisy of him literally yelling this with his voice and not being deaf himself. He was a minister, and I was only a lowly woman. I would have gotten in trouble for being impertinent and \u201crebellious\u201d. (I left that whole super conservative patriarchal movement) There were a few other deaf ministries, and they all apologized for his actions and said he didn\u2019t speak for the deaf community. One woman gave me a hug. I have no idea why he even came, other than attention and the pats on the back for \u201csacrificing\u201d for such a difficult ministry. He definitely did not get the kind of attention he wanted. So many ministry leaders got upset over his outburst. \n\nI know I can\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to be deaf. I do have disabilities and can comiserate a wee little bit. I think having schools and churches, etc *is* important. But I think we\u2019re all better humans when we break down walls and all come together in fellowship (spiritual and secular). So purposefully erecting walls thst limits people from communicating with others doesn\u2019t make sense to me. I think having hearing people in your boyfriend \u2018s life is positive. Like it would be when people and dogs help the blind. The world doesn\u2019t stop or change for the atypical. So I don\u2019t know why anyone would want to purposefully make it harder for someone to better navigate our society.\n\nThere\u2019s also a high chance that your boyfriend\u2019s mom would have been just as hostile if there hadn\u2019t been the issue of deafness. Some people will fixate on something to gatekeep and be exclusive about because it\u2019s their nature. There\u2019s often narcissism involved. In your specific situation, you could be perfect and deaf, and they\u2019d still find conflict with you about something.\n\nAll you can do is support your boyfriend and allow him to work through it. If you can find a counselor throught r/deaf I highly recommend it because I was helped so much by them with my own just no family members. \n\n(I hope that the terms and ideas I used are respectful and don\u2019t cause any disrespect for anyone in the deaf community. That\u2019s not my intention. Sorry for the long personal story. I thought it might help explain some of the thought processes of some deaf community members.)",
            "I have come across this phenomenon in other cases, it seems not uncommon in deaf communities\n\nthere seems to be a certain amount of ostracization of less-deaf people by deaf communities, for a complex of reasons. It may have to do with feeling outcasted or discriminated against by the hearing community, and then forming very tight closed communities with their private self-sufficient language and and shunning others for preferring the \u201chearing\u201d world. \n\nBeing disabled is relative to how you define being abled. I think for some type of deaf communities, to choose hearing is to define deafness as a disability- which is unacceptable to someone who defines deafness as a different equally \u201cvalid\u201d way of being abled that is misunderstood and misdefined by the elitist hearing world. \n\nSomewhat akin to racism: in a world where for race/culture A is the norm, if you were a racial minority x, yet instead of embracing and validating X culture you embrace the normative A culture- this could be seen as a betrayal to the X community.\n\nThis is my rough understanding, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d understand better than I could if you look into it.\n\nPerhaps his parents have some version of these thought patterns that they\u2019ve learned as coping mechanisms . In any case , what you represent to them seems to challenge some sensitive beliefs that they feel the need to hold onto.

He's upset that someone he loves is being unreasonably mean to someone else he loves.\n\nI think the best thing to do to cheer him up is to distract him from the situation.

            "Any community of people can have its snobbish, insulated cliques that look down on or think less of outsiders.  Just as a community can have those who are open and welcoming.  It's a shame Alan's parents fall into the first category.\n\nAlan is prioritizing YOU by distancing himself from his parents.  While this is a good sign for your relationship, you don't want to see him break away from his family over this, and if this is as far as his parents have gone, he shouldn't have to, but neither should you be made to feel excluded or unwelcome by his family, for *you have done nothing wrong*.\n\nThere are several options:  Alan can see his family, but without you.  This might be the easiest, at least for now.  But eventually, there will have to be a little bit of tolerance from his parents and you, to be able to coexist for brief periods - holidays and such, so that it isn't miserable for everyone.  If his parents can't learn to tolerate you, they risk losing Alan.\n\nAlan can try talking to his parents and pressure them into changing their views, but this might damage their opinion of *him*.  Since they seem to worship the deaf community, they may feel they are losing him to the 'outsiders,' or that you are corrupting him.  Ideally, Alan should be kept out of this as much as possible.  It's not his battle to fight, but if he wants to leap to your defense, that's OK.\n\nThis is my preferred solution:  You stand up for yourself and write a strong, clearly-worded letter to his parents.  Do not attack them, nor defend yourself - *you don't have to defend your existence to anyone*.  Simply state that all people are worthy of the same basic respect and decency regardless of background, ability/disability, or anything else beyond their control.  Make it clear that you have shown them all due courtesy and you expect to be shown basic courtesy in return and not to be blatantly insulted.  Emphasize your desire to make peace if they are willing.  That leaves the next move up to them, and makes it clear you will not allow yourself to be bullied.\n\nThey sound like the kind of people who don't even understand their own thoughts and words and the hurt they cause.  They simply snipe at you because you're different from what they are accustomed to, and probably because when they integrated into the deaf community for their son, they were on the receiving end of that kind of behavior as well.  They think they are defending themselves from an imaginary threat, as isolationist cliques tend to feel about everyone else.  They must understand that you are not a threat to anything.\n\nIt is 100% their responsibility to recognize that they are wrong and to change their behaviors.  If they cannot or will not do that, you will not be able to have an amicable relationship with them until they do, and they must also realize this will jeopardize their relationship with Alan.  You will know that you tried to make peace, and that any peace offering in the future must come from them.",
            "Sadly, there are parents of disabled children who seem to want to \"own\" their children's disabilities. Based on this post and some of your comments, I think that applies here. It's like Autism Parents who say things about autism their children do not appreciate. Who wear Autism Speaks t-shirts when people with autism hate Autism Speaks, and get mad if you point that out because \"I love my child.\" And I think they DO - I just don't think they realize that they've gotten so immersed in that culture, they've forgotten that what's true for their kid might not be true for everyone, or even that what they envision for their kid might not be what their kid envisions. Sometimes this is done with good intentions; other times, not so much.\n\n(As someone with a few disabilities, this has always astonished me. My parents certainly had to do a few things differently, as did/do I, but they never wanted me to be defined by my spoons.)\n\nI imagine that's what happened here. They've \"accepted\" that deaf/HOH act a certain way and make certain decisions, which isn't fair to you, and it's not fair to Alan that they aren't pleased he chose another direction.\n\nThat being said, I do understand why Alan is sad. Are there other family members he can reach out to?",

            "I've seen in your comments that his ex-wife was deaf, and between that and the top comment speculating that his family has kept him isolated (which seems to come out of nowhere, but could be a personal judgement call based on prior experience?) has me wondering.\n\n(At least) two significant others in a row with hearing disabilities seems a little unlikely. Of course, that can be drastically affected by the difficulty of communication outside of written language, and how important communication is for a *relationship*, so it might mean nothing at all, but... I can't help but wonder if the parents have been hostile towards anyone else who can hear them?\n\nIt might not necessarily be that they're hostile because you're not 100% deaf, it might be that they're consistently assholes to *anyone*, but just avoid making it *blatantly obvious* to Alan. So they don't act that way with sign language, but *do* make snide remarks out loud, and neither Alan nor his ex picked up on it because they couldn't hear it. \n\nAlternatively? They *might* be well-meaning in a seriously head-up-ass way. \n\nThey might *think* pointing out your speech issues is helpful or welcome; I know I'm tempted to point out that your post has several grammar errors (though from experience I'm thinking English isn't your first language which would explain it; the post is at least *quite* understandable, and at that point, pointing it out isn't all that useful). \n\nTheir harsh opinions of your parents *might* stem from having spent all that time struggling to learn sign language to communicate with their son, diving headfirst into the deaf community and all the research and knowledge within, and having emerged with the determination that if Alan's deafness had been less severe they'd have done *so much more* to fix and improve his life... all while failing to realize that things might not have been so easy or so obvious as they *think* it would be for *other* people in *other* positions. \n\nAll in all, they might just be a little *stupid*. They're grown-ass adults, they should know better than to make public, flippant remarks about a near-deaf person's speech issues. I mean, fuck, *children* quickly realize that that sort of thing is rude. \n\nIf Alan's told them to stop being assholes and they're still being assholes, he's quite right to cut contact with them for a bit. They clearly didn't take it seriously enough the first time, and *something* needs to happen to get them to pull their heads out of their asses. ",

He was her dog but we've been together for two years and living together for one so it was hard on me too. We took him to the only emergency animal hospital in our town that's open 24/7 which is where my best friend happens to work. He was the vet that ended up helping us. We ran all kinds of tests and tried a few things to help him but ultimately put him down that night. As much as the situation sucked, I think my friend was excellent at handling everything and my girlfriend didn't seem to have any issues with him. \n\nFor the past two months she has expressed that she thinks her dog wasn't actually sick and our friend just ran all of those tests and put him down so he could make money.

My buddies and I have baseball season tickets (she has one too) and every time I go she asks if the \"dog murderer\" is going to be there and if he's going she won't come.

            "I work in the medical field and it's not uncommon that people respond very poorly to sad things.  One of the most important tools in the arsenal is to restate their position in as generous a way possible.  ie, \"you had a pet that you and I both loved deeply, the pet died because of *whatever*.  You feel sad, I feel sad too.  You feel betrayed by a system that you thought would help your pet.  As best I can tell the reason you feel betrayed is because despite the tests ordered my friend was unable to help save your dog.  Since then you have decided that the vet took advantage of you.  Do you believe that the dog would be better off if had let him suffer?  I know you loved and still love your dog.  I can't imagine how much you hurt because your friend is gone.  (that's the phrase where people always start crying, so you gotta pause there) What is it about this situation that I don't understand?\"  You gotta listen at this point and pretty much exactly repeat back to them what they told you, then i usually ask if i understand it correctly.  The next step is where it gets tricky.  Usually i use this dialog because we're about to call security to pull a grieving mom off the floor cause she's flipping her biscuit (which is horrible and awful for everyone involved)  \"What are you presently trying to accomplish and what can I do to help you accomplish it?\"  At this point one of two things have happened.  Either they recognize that they are being irrational with their emotional responses to bystanders or they haven't.  Most of the time they'll be rational at this point, but sometimes they won't, so I'll then ask more pointed questions.  \"Will being cold to my good friend bring back your furry friend?  Does making everyone else around more miserable make you feel better?\"  Typically I have about a 90% success rate with this dialog for deescalating tense situations.  \n\nSometimes people feel like the best way of showing how much they love their lost one is by being a dick to everyone.  My best guess is that they do it to demonstrate that they loved more than decorum allows, so by violating social rules and norms they can show themselves and others that this is the case.  Once they figure out why they are being a dick it usually settles down.  Good luck man.  Let us know how it turns out.\n\nEDIT: Oh one more thing.  REASON DOES NOT APPLY.  Forcing ultimatums will only give her a venue to further demonstrate how deeply she feels/loves whatever.  Grief makes people dumb.  I'm not justifying her behavior but man, if i had 2 bucks every time I experienced something like this in the face of loss I could pay off my student loans easily.   If you try to guide the logic of a grieving person you'll just come off as manipulative and she'll probably entrench herself deeper in the delusion.  You can't give them the obvious conclusions even though you totally want to. All you are trying to do is build up the idea that you know that they love the departed and you can't possibly feel as awful as she does because no one feels as deeply as she can (even though it's probably not true). ",
            "This sounds like it is more of an issue with your girlfriend's grief and her difficulty processing it. Losing a pet, especially one that still so young, is really sad and your girlfriend has a right to her feelings. What she doesn't have a right to is to control who you can and can't be friends with. I would encourage your girlfriend to talk to someone to help her deal with the grief of losing her dog, but I'd also stand your ground and back your friend up. Malpractice is a pretty serious accusation and it sounds like your girlfriend's grief is clouding her judgement. ",

I don't know about you, but other than his annual check-up, I don't run my dog to the emergency vet just for shits and giggles.  The dog was clearly ill.  He clearly needed care.  Why she's denying that now is beyond me...\n\nI agree with you about this potentially being a relationship-ender.  Your friend did everything right, the dog was too ill to save (it's tragic, but it happens...it's the risk we all take when we get pets), and now your girlfriend needs to grow up about it and quit calling your friend a \"dog murderer\".

If the vet recommended euthanasia, it was because it was the most humane option for the animal.\n\nI think her telling you not to see him is unreasonable.  Her calling him dog murderer is disrespectful.  You need to sit her down and have a very blunt discussion with her.

            "I've worked at a vet office for the last eight years and can tell you people become very unlike themselves when their animals get sick. It does not excuse her behavior whatsoever, though.\n\nHere's an example of what I know -- I'm not sure if it'll help or hurt but I'll share it anyway: the veterinarian I work for owns his own practice but also works 1-2 days a week at another office as relief. At his own practice, obviously everything he orders or performs helps make him money, but he does not make as much as people think. For all the lab work we send out, we get a monthly bill from the lab for the costs of those tests which we usually break even on. Same goes for euthanasias, especially if the pet gets cremated. The only service we typically make a profit on is vaccines. That said...\n\nEuthanasia is almost always a last step. No one wants to do it. It's just as hard for us because we've known most of these pets since they were just a few weeks old. We get the \"I'd love to be a vet but I couldn't put animals down!\" comment all the time and the answer is always the same: it's always hard, but it's easier when it's the right thing to do. If the dog had an incurable sickness, it'd would've been so much more cruel and selfish to keep him alive and make him suffer. In that way, your friend helped that dog by helping him pass in a humane, (I'm assuming) peaceful way. It doesn't make him a \"dog murderer\" -- it makes him someone who was able to do the right thing even though it was difficult. Your friend isn't Michael Vick, ffs.\n\nI've only skimmed the comments, but if this is ONLY about the loss of her dog, there are grief hotlines for pets. You'll have to Google for the number, and I'm sure there are online chats available as well. If this is something more, I don't know if there's much you can do.

Basically, he ate a long piece of twine and it acted like a cheese cutter in his intestines. He had emergency surgery to fix it and was kept for observation. He started to decline, wouldn't eat, his protein levels dropped, but the vet said he could pull through. We kept trying to get him to eat. We brought canned food, bacon, hot dogs, steak, all of his favorite things. All the while we were racking up vet hospital bills. Finally his protein levels were so low that his cell membranes started to break down and he started bleeding. We were called down to euthanize. It was the worst feeling ever, because we put him through so much when we could have euthanized him in the first place. There's not a day that goes by that I don't kick myself for not knowing exactly what to do and I find myself wondering whether the vet kept our dog alive and in torturous pain because we took him to a teaching hospital and his residents could learn a lot from the situation.",
            "Losing a dog can be really hard on some people, I know that if anything happens to my baby I would probably need counselling. \n\nMy dog isn't just a dog to me and I know for a fact I would deal with his inevitable death hard.\n\nI would have a serious sitdown conversation and explain to her that you understand how difficult it was to lose her dog but you WON'T put up with her slandering your friend. Either she gets help with her grief and stops the slandering or you will have to end things with her.\n\nIf she goes with the former, help and forgive her, if she chooses the latter then help her pack her shit.",
            "I honestly would suggest that your girlfriend seek some kind of help for her feelings about her dog's passing. When a pet passes away in a way that is traumatic to their family (and I'd include dying suddenly as something in that category) it can be really, really hard on people. She's not looking at this situation rationally at all, and it's not good for you or for her. Talking to a therapist is one option, but in some areas there are also support groups for pet loss; check a local shelter for this type of group.",
            "I think you should break up with her now.\n\nShe cannot accept that things really do just happen, and no one is to blame, so she's blaming the person closest to you. Don't be surprised when she starts blaming you.",
            "OP, I'm not saying that how she is feeling is right but it's incredibly common. People who have to unexpectedly euthanize their pets hold onto some very weird superstitions and feelings.\n\nI worked at an emergency veterinary clinic. I've seen it all first hand. Some people refuse to see the same DVM that euthanized a previous pet, for any reason. Some people refuse to sit in the same *room* that it happened in. In one of the most extreme cases I had one woman call to ask if there were any additional emergency facilities in the area because she's put a dog down in all three in my area and couldn't even be in the same **building**.\n\nLike others have said, she is looking to put the blame somewhere. It wasn't her dog's fault, he's innocent! It couldn't be her fault because she loved him (and that's ignoring the fact that many owners unknowingly harm their pets through ignorance). It *had* to be the vet's fault. There is no one else! That's forgetting that freak things sometimes happen and no one is to blame.\n\nThe sad fact is that she might not be able to get over this. Some people simply aren't emotionally equipped to properly handle things like this. It's up to you how you proceed, but I'd certainly put my foot down for my friend.\n\nI'm also just going to guess as to what happened. Since the dog was young, it happened quickly, and it ended in euthanasia I'm going to guess one of three things: GDV/\"bloat\", something neuro-related (possibly through poisoning), or internal bleeding.",

I blew my whole paycheck the day I got it taking him to an emergency care facility when he began to seize from low blood sugar at 1AM. \n\nI loved that dog. We all cried when he got let go- my boyfriend, me, the doctor I work closely with at my hospital. \n\nNobody wants to make money from tragedy.

Euthanasia is definitely not a way to profit for veterinarians because the patient won't be in for future visits. If the vet truly wanted to profit he/she would've pushed for [read as guilted] your SO into a costly treatment plan with a low-success rate. Basically this would equate to expensive treatments, frequent visits, and profit approach that you occasionally see. \n\nAs this wasn't the case, your SO is likely grieving. Personally I see this A LOT when dealing with euthanasias. I've seen people make the right choice ( quality over quantity of life) but still feel guilt ridden by it. It's easier for them to blame the vet performing the euthanasia than to accept that they made a hard, but compassionate choice. *Hell I've even seen vets with over 30 years experience get sued over it*.\n\nMy suggestion for you, and what I do for most clients, is to offer to go to a pet loss support group in your area ( many teaching vet schools have them). You could also do a bit of research on the disease and find all the literature you can on it and reassure her that she made the correct choice. By \"right choice\" I mean given the animal's past condition and potentially future occurring alignments- would he/she have had prolonged suffering? \n\nAlso if no disease was diagnosed, you could google a \"Pet Quality of Life Scale\" where it has you quantitatively assign numbers to their condition and suggests a plan of action. It's less emotionally charged and more subjective. I would like to add that this would have been better to use prior to euthanasia,\nbecause currently her perception may be skewed by emotions; use your best judgement here.\n\nTl;dr: she's grieving. In my experience everyone handles a pets death differently; which is OK. She's attempting to force you to experience/feel her grief as she does ; NOT OK. Just as it's unacceptable to try to speed up someone's healing process for your own comfort, they CAN'T force you to grieve as they do for their own comfort.

[Friend] did what was best and kindest for a sick animal. She needs to accept this and grieve the loss of the dog - not hold on to this anger that impedes the grieving process. Tell her that you want to support her during this time - and you aren't necessarily properly equipped to help her navigate her grief, so you want her to seek counseling to help her through. \n\nIf she absolutely refuses, you may need to play hardball and tell her that her behavior towards [friend] is straight up unacceptable - it is rude and just UNTRUE.

I think she should focus more on her relationship with you, and not hating your best friend. It should always be bros before girlfriend, and she is pretty much making you choose between the two. Her reason of putting you in this tough situation is not logical, and even if you stop talking to your best friend, it won't help situation in any way. You have no reason to believe your best friend made a bad judgement call. If she insists, then I think it is a pretty simple choice for you.",
            "She's trying to find reason and sense in an irrational and senseless world. She's trying to process her grief, and it's coming out sideways. Talk to her about how you miss the dog, too, and how awful it was that he got sick. Talk about your shared memories with the dog, the wonderful things you all did together. Talk about how your friend tried so incredibly hard to save him, and how much your friend cried with the two of you as the dog was put down. Bring her back to reality by reminding her of what really happened. Don't shame her for feeling grief; help her normalize it and accept it so she can move past it.",

If she is in an already bad state, she will not understand other than that you are making a threat that will make her more distressed by pushing her more. You can escalate by other means.\n\nShe is not dealing well with her grief, and she is denying, bargaining and angry. All symptoms of grief. We can label it immature or crazy, but all in all, these are normal grief symptoms (5 steps of grief). Ultimatums may help you leave if you plan to do so, but they will not help her get help she needs. If you constructively want to save your relationship, you need to explain how you feel while remaining empathic to her situation and her feelings. If you can use a voice that inspire empathy in the listener, you may achieve her seeking therapy without having to fight her on it.",

I loved her like my child she was with me  everywhere I went. In my darkest moments she was what helped me not want to blow my head off. Two months ago my bf accidentally let her out of the house while going to an appointment and she was ran over. I am not over it. But I in no way blame him for it, because I know he loved her just as much as I did and feels horrible for it. Your gf is hurting and doesn't know how to handle that hurt. It is easier for us as humans to deal with something bad that has happened by placing blame on something, anything or anyone that will help ease that hurt. I think you need to sit down with your gf and help her realize this that it was not your vet friend who killed her dog, it was just a shitty situation and he did everything he could in his power to save her dog.

I'd give her fair warning, though.",

I hated her for a while afterwards, but came around after seeing an older dog in pain.  It's a hard decision to make but she needs to realize it's the best choice sometimes when they're suffering.  ",
            "Grief has many different stages. Sounds like she's not coping very well. It may help her to seek some professional counselling so she can learn healthy ways to cope. I'd also suggest she volunteer some time in a vet clinic; education about what it's like to care for sick animals might help. Has she ever lost anyone close to her?",
            "She's hurting. This doesn't mean her actions are ok - in fact FAR from it. If it were my cat (he's totally like my life mascot) and my boyfriend's friend... I'd have a really hard time with it potentially too. Like losing a family member, sometimes when there is death involved, you need some counseling. Yeah it was a new pet and she didn't have time to connect much... but she had plans of this creature being a part of both or your lives for quite some time. Ask your friend if he knows any good counselors that he's suggested to other patients/owners. Again - it isn't ok what she's doing, but I do understand. I don't think you HAVE to break up and I don't think this is the end of you guys - she just needs a healthy way to work through the loss. She's currently doing it in an unhealthy way that likely hurts not just your friend, and you, but also herself. She's not healing and it'll only end badly for everyone. Get her some help and maybe have your friend talk to her a little?",

            "Dump her. She literally sounds like a child throwing a fit. Your buddy was professional about the entire thing. If he really wanted to make money, I doubt he would of killed his bestfriends girlfriends dog. She's not going to stop unless you PROVE the dog was sick, and honestly you should not go through this stupid process. If she can't accept that her dog was sick, you should probably end things with her. She sounds offensively immature by referring to your friend as a \"dog murderer\"\n\nAs a girl, I recommend you talk to her about the seriousness of this situation and how immature and rude she is being. She needs to understand that she needs to stop this behavior or you'll leave. If she's acting like this over a dog, she's only going to get worse about other things. In all, if she's going throught the trouble of wanting you to stop hanging out with him, she's not going to stop. If she firmly believes her dog was \"murdered\" the only way she will EVER stop (not guaranteed) is if you let her rule your life. Cut off your friend, and do everything she wants, but then, Im pretty sure you'll be miserable.",
            "wow,  she really has gone into denial and is stuck in the anger phase.  \n\nI am sorry but this sounds like a serious red flag.  Who the hell says shit like 'dog murderer'???   He was doing his job and you trust his judgement.  \n\nIn regards to stopping it, you need to realize you are no longer dealing with an adult but an irrational child.   You need to confront her about the issue and be ready with points to address any possible issues.  \n\nWhat could your friend have done differently. \nWhat procedures (has she even bothered to look up what else could have been done) did he 'not do'.\nDoes she remember the pain the dog was in that forced you to go to the ER in the first place. \nHas your friend ever been rude or disrespectful to either of you as a couple or anything to show poor moral character?\n\nThis is assuming she is willing to have a mature conversation about her actions.   She is seriously depressed or something psychological and may resist having to face the reality of her situation.   Its possible she is blaming herself, and is redirecting that guilt to him to avoid hating herself.   She needs to see a therapist or something.  \n\nYou have to play hardball and make it clear that you find her behavior alarming, It is risking your relationship status because she is being extremely inappropriate and displaying qualities you do not find attractive as a partner.     Basically someone has to be an adult and call her out on her childish mentality.   In this case, you.   \n\nIf she listens, or tries to take what you say to heart, then give her time.   If she continues the rude behavior, then i think you go with breaking up.  Dont mention this to friends unless breakup is inevitable and in this case its very fair to let the social circle know WHY you two ended things.  \n\n",
            "People become vets because they love critters.  Its not real high money or prestige like a doctor but near as much study.  I doubt very much your friend wanted to put the dog down and actually tried everything he could to avoid it  \nYour girlfriend rewriting history won't change that.  If she can't remember how bad off her dog really was and continues to blame the vet she is stuck in the denial part of her grieving process.  If she can't get control of herself you need a new girlfriend.  This will not be the greatest challenge you face as a couple and she just isn't up to it.",
            "I'm not saying your friend is one of them, but there are truly bad vets out there. I've worked with some. I've seen the after math of bad medicine first hand at my clinic. We get a lot of second opinion cases. Sometimes it baffles me what other vet practices do. \n\nThese veterinarians have friends and family that probably think they're great and have no idea what horrible things they've done.\n\nThat being said grief is hard. I'm two weeks post euthanasia of my own dog and go back and forth between acceptance and blaming myself my boss and anyone who may have been involved. It's a long sad road I wish you both the best.\n\n",
            "If this is your gf's first big loss, she still needs to learn how to handle such things. Unfortunately some people never learn. Counseling might help her, or it might not.

            "One of these days it's going to be you who does something completely reasonable, and she's going to be insanely unreasonable in blaming you.  Your girlfriend can't handle bad things happening to her.  I'd keep the friend, and dump the girlfriend.  ",

            "One of the things I love about this sub is the true commitment you get from everyone. I can get caught up in a comment thread & follow it down the rabbit hole before realizing \"oops, it's just one thread & now 3 people debating why/not OP should stick with her through counseling before ending it. When statistics start getting quoted, it's time to run. \n\nBottom line OP is that this is all dependent on what you want/need/will tolerate. The purpose of this post was met: you are 100% justified in feeling she's way outta line & it needs to be addressed. \n\nNow only you can decide the next move. There's a lot of good opinions & experience in here, it does seems she suffers from a mental health diagnosis but a doc is the only one who should really decide which end of the spectrum it's on (could be severe depression vs. borderline personality vs. schizoaffective). \n\nFirst decide how much you can \"handle\" or \"be okay with\", be sure about this because you'll have to relay to her what your limits are if you stay. Whether you break up or not isn't the major issue, I feel it's more that she gets help & if you choose to support her, you protect yourself as well. Know that she may not react well, she may devolve into a crisis state which will be scary & bizarre but ultimately lead to help for her. \n\nThere's too many possibilities to prepare for. Just make sure you know what you want, what you're willing to help her with, have an escape plan & don't put any expectations on anything. But take care of you first above anyone else. Good luck!",

            "As a vet student, I can tell you that no vet does their job for the money. I know your friend ran all those tests because he wanted so badly to figure out what was going on and help get your dog on the road to recovery. Euthanasia is a last resort for vets too. Sorry for your loss. ",
            "For many moral veterinarians (most of us) what she's implying is literally the most hurtful thing anyone could accuse me of. I literally live, breathe and sleep the welfare of animals. Even knowing people out there suspect vets of this hurts my soul. \n\nIf I tried my best to save a friends pet and wound up having to put him down, and later found out what your gf has been saying, I'd be hurt beyond belief.

            "It sounds to me like it all happened very quickly and she didn't have time to process what happened. \n\nBoth of the cats I lost were downward spirals that lasted days in the case of one and months in the case of the other. Before they even came up with any diagnosis, they warned me about the worst case scenarios. As I was watching the decline and waiting for confirmation of the cause, I was pretty much already grieving. By the time I put them down, I knew beyond any doubt that they were very sick and that I had done everything I possibly could.\n\nI'm guessing it happened so fast that your girlfriend thinks there must have been more she could do. She feels like she was rushed and pressured into a decision that wasn't hers.\n\nWithout knowing what was wrong with the dog, it's hard for me suggest where to proceed from there. u/Farts_McGee had some excellent advice for walking her through her reasoning. I think you need to help her understand there was nothing else she or your friend could have done. But don't shove facts in her face or anything, you have to be gentle and patient.",

OP, it sounds like your girlfriend is an irrational, self-absorbed person with star-of-her-own-movie syndrome and a persistent need to blame others for bad things that happen in her life. Maybe it's fortunate you got a chance to see this side of her relatively early on in the relationship.\n\nMy advice: whatever you do, please shield your friend from her ire. The people I know who work in animal healthcare say that euthanasia is the hardest part of the job, and it can be deeply upsetting and even traumatic. Don't expose your friend to any bad juju around the decision to mercifully end this dog's suffering.",

Was it something she came home and googled and found out a lot of dogs recover from or was the decision that the best thing to do is put him/her down indisputable.   You're assuming, and asking everyone else to assume, that your best friend was \"of course\" right and that there was absolutely nothing that could be done and therefore your GF is nuts.  That may be.  But I've gotten advice from Vets who were wrong and she may feel he \"pulled the trigger\" so to speak way to quickly and the dog might have been saved.  So what was the \"condition\" that caused the vet to put him/her down so quickly?"
