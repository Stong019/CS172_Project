And 'Just telling me to quit my boy habits'.\n\nI was baffled and I asked what it is he want from this relationship (Because I was under the impression he wanted me to break up with him), and he said for me to listen to him and basically do what he says, so I told him I am listening to him, and that I didn't like what I was listening to. \n\nSo I told him he was being sexist pig, made points of saying how often I play my PS4 and that he can use it more than me. I then rounded it up by telling him to go f*** himself and that we were done (not the most gracious thing to do, but it got the message across.) \n\nI'm sitting in my old bedroom receiving mixed text messages from, between \"I'm sorry baby please come back.\" and \"Stop being such a b****\" You get the point reddit, I don't need that, nor deserve it. I'm a mixture of emotions, but hey -- At least I can romance MacCready or Danse on FO4. Haha.\n\nTLDR; broke up with him, told him he was being a sexist pig and I'm at my parents, currently romancing MacCready/Danse on FO4 (Ha).",

They get all shitty about it. Thankfully dudes like that are the squeaky power-armor that get the grease, and there are a hundred rad guys to replace them that actually WANT a girl who has fun doing nerdy shit. \n\nAlso the measure of a person who is worth sorting things out with?

        "selftext": "Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m1h23/due_to_our_living_arrangements_my_older_sister_26/\n\nBasically, our parents left for Korea two years ago to live closer to our grandparents who were both battling illnesses. They originally planned on staying in America until we graduated High School but due to worsening health conditions they decided to they weren't going to wait any longer. Our older sister stepped up to impress our parents but ended up taking on a little more than she could handle becoming very bitter and jealous toward us, borderline abusive especially with how much time we would spend with her husband.\n\nWe got quite a few PMs that were telling us that things could easily go from verbal abuse to physical abuse so we quickly started to look through our options which were basically move to Korea or try to live on our own.\n\nAfter little bit of research we found out that in our state minors are legally able rent with a co-signature from an adult/parent and as long as the landlord agrees. We turned 17 on June 3rd which I think helped us out quite a bit. So we spoke with our parents about our situation, we made sure not to blame my sister but told my father that we thought it would be best that we moved out on our own to give our sister her life and husband back.\n\nOur parents agreed and we started making calls and within the second day of looking we found a nice cheap single bedroom apartment within our dad's budget. We share a bed now anyways so it's not that big of a deal for us go with one bedroom. We moved pretty quickly through the process, we figured the sooner the better and there was a opening. Our dad flew back from Korea here to help us as soon as we were able to get all the paperwork set in stone. Even though he was extremely upset with my sister, we pleaded her case. And for first time went head to head with our dad a little bit because we understand our parents are cruel and many times unreasonable people and that our sister went through their mental abuse alone while we had each other. \n\nWe must have said something right because he didn't scold her or anything like that. He thanked her for helping us in our time of need and watching over us for 2 years. Which is actually a lot coming from our dad. \n\nWe did end up thanking our sister for everything and expressed how grateful we were to her. To our surprise she actually cried as we were leaving totally unexpected and told us if we needed anything to just give her a call. We wrote her note, which we gave to Frank to give to her later on, not to be overly dramatic but just because we didn't think we could really say everything we had to say in person. We wrote down everything we could possible think of that we wanted to say to her,  about her life, our lives, our parents, how we feel about her, and just some sympathy overall. Basically a big thank you, with some heart to heart. Hopefully one day we can meet back up with her as equals and repay her for her kindness but for now, were just going to do our own thing. We know it'll take more than 3 page note and a little praise from our father to fix our relationship with her but it's a start.\n\nOur father has agreed to keep giving us money to live off of and for rent and told us to continue focusing on our future. His words were to not worry about part-time work and to just focus on school, high education and anything that will improve our college situation before we graduate high school.  We're taking the CCNA certification in a little under 4 weeks and then we'll work on getting any other smaller certifications as well as, \n\nWe did speak with Frank who said we were very brave and mature for taking the initiative and noticing our sister's behavior. He apologized for being unable to prevent her actions and said that he would still check on us and that we were free to text and call him for anything at anytime.\n\nWe've been on our own for about 5 days now and so far everything is great.\n\nThanks for the advice.\n \n\n**TL:DR:** We moved out into our own apartment, our dad came back and thanked my sister for supporting us for the two years and to check out our new place. We left a note with Frank to give to Lily hopefully to give her some perspective about how we actually feel in hopes that someday we can reconnect as sisters.\n",

            "Just a bit of advice from a fellow female who lived alone for many years-you girls need to be diligent in ensuring your home is safe. Lock the doors and windows at all times, especially when you are home. Buy some of the el cheapo alarms that let you know when a door/window has been opened and blackout curtains for all windows.\n\n Keep an eye out for anyone suspicious and don't even crack the door to anyone you were not expecting or don't know; demand identification if they claim any form of authority. Befriend your neighbors, especially couples/other women, because they will keep an eye out for you. Good people tend to be very protective of those around them, especially in your situation.\n\n If possible, get a dog, doesn't have to be a big one, just so long as they can bark, acting as a first alert. Stash a few knives around the house, especially in areas you are particularly vulnerable  (bath & bedroom). See if there are any self defense courses offered for women in your area and take them.\n\n I'm not saying this to frighten you, I myself never had any problems, but a little diligence can go a long way in self preservation. Best of wishes to you and yours.",

Thanks for all of your advice in my previous post. To those of you giving me information on programs in Japan - thank you! I took all of your advice to heart, but unfortunately I already have a job in the STEM field lined up to begin this summer and programs like those are not in the realm of possibilities.\n\nAnyway, on to the actual update. I talked to Jack the night after I made my post. I told him that I knew his parents meant well by it, but the way they were constantly filling me in on the details of their trip made me more sad than interested. At first Jack didn\u2019t understand what I was trying to say or why hearing about the trip would upset me; when I reminded him about my rejection from the study abroad program and the time he\u2019d spent helping me work through that, he was able to empathize a little more. \n\nJack told me he recognized that his parents were, albeit indirectly, being rude by going out of their way to tell me about the vacation. He said that gushing so much about a vacation to anyone who wasn\u2019t going was insensitive and if I asked them politely they would tone it down. Unfortunately, he refused to talk to them himself. I\u2019d requested that he do so to get things resolved a little more smoothly, but in the end it was up to me. \n\nI decided to call ahead and visit Jack\u2019s parents privately to have the conversation, instead of during or after one of our dinners (that would have been awkward). I broached the subject with his parents by saying that I appreciated their thoughtfulness in trying to keep me updated on the vacation planning, but that travel to Japan was still a sore subject to me and hearing about it made me sad. I spoke for a while about my dream to travel there, the study abroad, and how I was very regretful that the experience had impacted me so strongly. It was incredibly selfish of me to get jealous so easily, and I planned to work on my sensitivity in light of the issue. I had hoped that by making the conversation more focused on my behavior than theirs, it would deflect the blame from them and feel like less of a direct attack. It did not work so well.\n\nThroughout my whole monologue, they were completely silent. As soon as I finished, Jack\u2019s mom said quite coldly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re offended.\u201d I kept the conversation going for a few more minutes, trying my hardest to reiterate that it wasn\u2019t their fault, but I received only short, cold responses. Jack\u2019s dad did not speak at all and walked out of the room as soon as I stood up to leave. Before I left I thanked his mother for speaking with me and said I\u2019d see them at dinner during the week. Her only response was \u201cwe\u2019ll see.\u201d \n\nWhen I told Jack about the confrontation, he was confused by their reaction but changed his stance on the whole thing. Now he\u2019s saying that I was being unreasonable from the start and I should\u2019ve been able to tell they would take it poorly as it was rude of me to mention it to them at all. He insists that they would have had the same reaction if he had told them instead of me. \n\nOver the course of the week Jack\u2019s parents never contacted me about dinner, which the four of us usually have together weekly. Our dinner dates are always on Wednesday, so yesterday I decided to take the plunge and give his mom a call. I asked if she was still on for our usual Wednesday dinner and told her I\u2019d been wanting to make a new recipe for them to try for a while now. She said, \u201csorry, that\u2019s not going to work.\u201d And that was the end of the conversation.\n\nSo here\u2019s where I am now, hurt and completely confused. His parents are ignoring me completely and my relationship with Jack is strained since he vehemently denies supporting me at all. I\u2019m at a loss for what to do here. I don\u2019t know why either of them reacted like this. Any advice is appreciated, as always, but I\u2019ve decided to just see if time will mend the wounds. In the meantime, I\u2019m reconsidering my relationship with all three of them. \n\n**EDIT**: Jack's mom called me on the phone a couple of hours ago. In a nutshell, she told me very spitefully that they brought it up to me so frequently to make me jealous. She said they were hoping I would eventually break down and beg them to pay for me to come - that way they could show Jack that I am of a lesser social standing and \"not a good fit\" for him. Then, she basically broke up with me for Jack over the phone (wtf?). I am honestly at such a loss here, maybe this was just a lie she made up because she was offended but even so it's incredibly hurtful. I have no idea if Jack knows about any of this but I don't care, I am done with him and them, I do not want to be associated with such classist, manipulative people. This was such a terrific waste of three years of my life.\n\n**TL;DR** talked to boyfriend, he understood but wanted me to tell the parents myself. They were upset, Jack has apparently taken their side, and parents have avoided contact for the past week.  \n\n**TL;DR update** Jack's mom called me and claims they wanted to make me jealous enough to beg to go on the trip with them so that Jack would see how poor I was and break up with me.",

If Jack's not willing to take the lead in dealing with his parents over something this innocuous, even if he understands where you're coming from, how can you trust him to have your back if they do something that *really* makes you uncomfortable?",

Then, she basically broke up with me for Jack over the phone (wtf?)\n\nWell, now you know they're spinless snobs, you can move on and find better people and given how shitty these people are, that will be very easy for someone as good as you.\n\nJack must have known they didn't think highly of you, that's why he refused to speak with them.  He didn't want to go against them.\n\nIt's a shame that out of the four of you, you were the only adult.",
            "I think it was crappy of him to put you in that situation. What could have been a quiet comment from him turned into a huge awkward monologue from you.\n\nI am sorry that his parents responded so coldly, and given Jack's response to you after *he told you to confront them*, I would move on.",
            "> In the meantime, I\u2019m reconsidering my relationship with all three of them.\n\nthis is the only thing that makes sense now. honestly though, the relationship should have been over as soon as Jack decided that you weren't important enough to him to stand by you and told you to face his parents by yourself, but especially now that he's trying to throw you under the bus to his own family.",
            "I'm married and I have a child. My husband and I are in our 30s, and we have dated and dealt with all kinds of crazy dynamics as well as ups and downs. I'm saying this so you will understand the background in my piece of advice on this:\n\nJudge everyone by their actions. Not your intentions. You've been with your BF for 3 years, and I am sure at this point, you are looking at him through a serious lens to determine if he is \"lifelong\" material. This is a decision that should NOT be made on love. It's should be made on:\n\n- Similar/compatible religious beliefs\n\n- Similar/compatible family planning beliefs\n\n- Similar/compatible financial planning, practices, and beliefs\n\n- Similar/compatible extended family viewpoints, interactions, and beliefs\n\n- Mutual respect\n\n- Teamwork (I know this sounds funny as hell, but it's true)\n\nThere are a few other items that will make or break a long term relationship, but I'm sure you get the jist. In this, your BF kind of failed. \n\nFor starters, he fed you to the wolves. You had a legitimate concern with his parents. Your emotions and feelings were valid. Were they easy emotions? No. But they were real and they were valid. Instead of manning up, taking responsibility, and doing what was right for you and your relationship, he took the easy way out. He told you to take care of it. \n\nSecondly, you did. When you did, they were cold. You can't really do anything about this. I think putting the emphasis about you and how you need to work on yourself and requesting compassion and understanding was brilliant. That shows maturity and the search for growth. I like that. But they didn't handle it in an adult manner. They got quiet, passive aggressive, and dismissive \"We'll see\" is right up there with saying  \"nothing\" when asked \"what's wrong\". That's what petty teens do. \n\nThird, Jack basically gas-lit you when you told him what happened. First, he tells you to handle it. So you do. Then he tells you by doing what he told you to do, you were rude to do anything at all! \n\nFourth, the general consensus I'm getting from this is that his parents and him are acting as if you should have \"shut up and colored\". That pretty much means that you should have ignored your own valid emotions and feelings and put stock and value into theirs over yours. Their need to tout and gloat about the trip and his need to appear as the golden boy with the submissive girl. No one. And I mean NO ONE respected you, your emotions, or your feelings in all of this. \n\nJudge people by their actions. Not your intentions. Not what you hope they could be. You can't fix people, you can't change people, hell you can't even persuade people most of the time. People are going to treat you however they think you should be treated. Right now they think that you were rude for having emotions. They think you were wrong for voicing your opinion and need. Think about that very hard because that behavior won't magically go away over time. \n\nUnfortunately you now have a bigger problem on your hand than just this trip. Often this is also how these things are uncovered. The trip looks like the catalyst of the opening of the proverbial can of worms. \n\nSo what do you do? \n\nWell......\n\n1. Decide for yourself now how you deserve to be treated. What's your self worth? \n\n2. Decide for yourself now if this behavior is acceptable to be an ongoing behavior. If it's not, decide where your line in the sand on this is.\n\n3. Sit down with your SO and have a talk about the validity of your emotions on this. I.E. Tell him your emotions and feelings were valid. Make him explain why he believes they are not or why he isn't valuing them or treating them as if they are important (saying \"I am!\" isn't. His actions are beyond showing otherwise.)\n\n4. Decide if you want to move forward with trying to repair the relationship with his parents. This does not mean rolling over. If you know you are right, then you are right, stand firm. But understand you can only meet them halfway. If they are unwilling to try, you can't do much else and will need to respect that. \n\n5. Figure out now if this is how Jack is planning to \"support\" you in the future. Cause I have a feeling that when it comes to his parents, who could one day be your in laws, he may turn into a son instead of a husband around them. Go check out /r/justnomil for what that future looks like. \n\nI'm not going to say dump him or stay. But I will say you need to give this it's due diligence and think longterm. \n\n",
            ">Now he\u2019s saying that I was being unreasonable from the start and I should\u2019ve been able to tell they would take it poorly as it was rude of me to mention it to them at all.\n\nHe can't seriously claim that what you said was rude, but that his parents bragging about their ability to take an expensive trip that you can't was not. This is more then just picking their side, it's denying reality. \n\nI suspect that for whatever reason his parents don't like you and didn't want their son to date you.  This isn't your fault, they just seem like shitty people.  From your last post any reasonable person would not have repeatedly bragged like they did if they had any consideration of another persons feelings.  If you got a new phone and knew that one of your friends really wanted one but couldn't afford it, would you go on and on about how great it was to them each time you saw them?  Would you talk about how great and well paying a new job was to someone who had recently been laid off from theirs?  We all know that those things are asshole things to do.  And they didn't do this just once- they announced the trip to Jack in front of you, and kept on talking about it each time they saw you.  This was intentional. \n\nBeing rude in the way they were pushes you to confront them or avoid them and then they get to point (like they are doing now) at you, as if you standing up for yourself was the problem.  Remember it wasn't. If Jack can't see how awful his parents treated you then you are much better off without him.",

            "Honestly it sounds like behavior I've seen from more wealthier people. They go on these expensive trips all the time, they have huge banking accounts.\n\nBut they get offended so, so easily. Even when it's something as simple as \"please don't flaunt\" it's suddenly a grave, offensive slight towards them and their family image/reputation.\n\nNot everyone is like that and I've seen people on the lower ends of economic prosperity get offended over bizarre things as well, but this isn't too surprising. A very real possibility that they're the type to do this - Jack suddenly joining in shows that too - and... Yeah, it happened.\n\nI'd definitely reconsider it. They're not likely to apologize. They got offended at what you said despite a hefty chunk revolving around your issues, not theirs. I doubt they'd have the integrity to apologize - you'd be the one to do so. \n",
            "Here's the thing. You've been dating their son for 3 years and having dinner weekly for much of that time, but yo u have never been included in a vacation. If they were cash-strapped, I'd get that they couldn't pay your way,  but even then, I would have expected you to be invited. Since they're rich, I'm suspicious that they have been polite, but never fully accepting. They may have always expected him to drop you for one of their \"kind\". This vacation is a convenient wedge they discovered and are choosing to exploit. ",

It truly wasn't a waste of three years even if it feels like it.  There were probably lots of good times and you have an excellent idea now of what kind of family you don't want to marry into.\n\nYou wouldn't know it from reading this subreddit, but there are lots of well off dudes with kind families.  I'm not saying you're looking for a well off guy, but more that you don't have to avoid them or judge them all by this experience.  There are a-holes in all walks of life.\n\n",

I mean, wow. What fucking cancerous people. Human garbage, be glad they are out of your life. Thank god this happened now and not when you're on a marriage track. You're 23, you have a bright future ahead of you and you've learned a valuable lesson about assholes from some of the biggest in the world. Nothing can stop you now, brush it off and keep your head up because they're not worth a second thought, and neither is Jack unless he truly had no idea and can FULLY understand the gravity of what his parents did to you and deals with it accordingly.

            "I can kind of understand their reaction, but they're being really immature about it. It's unfortunate and they are handling it poorly, but it's possible they were genuinely excited and thought you would share that, and now they are hurt and disappointed that they can't. Maybe they are embarrassed as well. Or upset that now their happy trip is marred by negativity. It's not right of them to be refusing to talk to you and not making an effort to continue normal relations even if they are upset. Perhaps you are right and time will help mend the wound - if it happens quickly, I personally would be willing to forgive and forget their bad reaction and move on.  \n\nJack, though? He told you that you were perfectly reasonable and should talk to them, and now is telling you that you're unreasonable and should have never brought it up and that everything is all your fault. I would be so incredibly pissed off at him right now.   \n\nIf he really thought it was a bad idea, he should have said something - otherwise, what he just did was set you up to fail and ruin your relationship with his parents. If he did not think it was a bad idea and is now just saying so because they are mad, then he's a spineless asshole who is throwing you under the bus just so he can suck up to his parents. You and he need to have a very serious conversation about his actions in all this. ",
            "If I were you, I wouldn't have said anything. Sometimes you just have to suck it up, recognise that you're not being particularly rational, and stay on the right side of people. \n\nThat said, it sounds like you were incredibly respectful, polite and non-accusatory... so I don't really understand your boyfriend's parents' immature and cold reaction.  At this point I would write them - and your boyfriend - off as assholes to be honest. You've been with your boyfriend for three years, so he should absolutely not be blaming you for this or being a dick about it. He should have talked to his parents when you asked him to.\n\n",
            "The way I sense this is that the parents never liked you too much to begin with - possibly because of the wealth imbalance. Once you did one thing wrong, it compounded their negative feelings towards you.\n\nThe 3 of them are a bag of dicks. If they are so rich, they could have afforded for you to come on their dime. Your boyfriend has no spine and is still a child. He obviously takes his parents' side over yours. At best you have a few more months time with this boyfriend. His parents will influence him further away from you.\n\nIf he goes on this trip (A very likely scenario it seems), you should break up with him. I really see no future for you with these people.",
            "So people keep bringing up the fact that the parents could have brought you along to be a translator. It might be better than nothing, but it isn't actually a great idea. \n\nA. At some point you would want a break. It would be so tiring for you to translate for the whole group and be their employee. And if you are with your boyfriend, there is no doubt that you would want at least one night off to go be with him. What would the parents do then?\n\nB. How can they actually make sure you speak the language as good as you say you do? You might be amazing for an American and have gotten straight A's but an actual Japanese person will almost always be better than you.\n\nC. Same with culture. You may know A LOT about the culture, but a Japanese person would know a ton more. If a native told me how to behave in a restaurant, it would be an interesting cultural exchange. If my son's girlfriend told me how to act in a restaurant, I would be pissed.\n\nLook, I know for a fact that you will go to Japan one day. You have the drive and passion and money will start rolling from your STEM degree. It would be different if you could never ever go in your life time.

Classless parents raising a coward son is what they are!!**\n\nI'm confused here. \n\nBefore anyone down votes this I'm not attacking OP's maturity. I understand that she admitted fault in feeling jealous and that she is being \"petty\" (her words, not mine) about the whole situation.\n\nBut, can somebody explain to me why the parents are at fault for being offended? I come from an extremely strict background but I've gone against my parents (Chinese culture) many times but have also respected them in cases when it comes to relationship. They've hated and loved past GFs. It sounds like OP is making something out of nothing when she confronted them about their vacation plans. Is it their fault that they're going on a lavish vacation to Japan? While I understand that she wanted to go to Japan for a while now, she's not required to sit on the side and listen to her parents if she ultimately feels that uncomfortable, and that is what led to the parents getting offended. It may seem small to us, but to them it could be a sign of disrespect from a potential daughter-in-law.\n\nI think without understanding what culture her parents are from, you cannot conclude and judge that their parents have shown their true color. Perhaps in their culture, her confrontation with them was a sign that they don't want somebody with such jealousy to become apart of the family.\n\nEdit: It looks like I'm getting down voted already. Which is fine. But for those that disagree with those comment at least come up with an explanation? I understand where you're coming from that boyfriend (or potential wife/husband) should always stick up for you vs your parents. Unfortunately that type of thinking doesn't apply to older generations of certain cultures. Once you've offended them they'll be cold to you and does not want to see you as apart of their family. \n\nEdit 2: And for anyone saying that they're being pity, what would you do if you your future son/daughter-in-law did something to disrespect you? \n\nUltimate edit: In the end I think OP is maturing and have admitted that all this is pretty much based on her jealousy and past history of not getting into a program in Japan. It sounds like she has her head on straight. Regardless of the outcome, I hope she gains a lot from this and that she one day gets to go to Japan. \n\n",
            "As someone that didn't read the original story until now, my first thought was that Jack's parents were talking about the trip so much to make you jealous. They KNEW how much you wanted to visit Japan and could have afforded to bring you along. It also didn't fit their typical vacation plans. If they cared so much about trying to \"bond\" with you, they would have just invited you to go along with them. Many of my college friends take vacations together with their significant other, along with their family. It's normally a great way for the other person to feel closer to the family.\n\nWhen I read your update, Jack's parents' reactions said it all. They just never expected you to talk to them directly and confront them about the issue. I don't think that you did anything wrong here. Jack wasn't willing to talk to them for you and you attempted to maintain a good relationship with his parents by communicating with them your concerns and hurt.\n\nIt's unfortunate that Jack wasn't willing to stand up to his parents for you or to talk on your behalf. He was supposed to be the one to do so. On the bright side OP, you've dodged a bullet! I have a feeling that Jack's parents have been hinting to him that they didn't approve of you anyways, given his reaction. Also, shame on Jack's parents for having no class at all. How mean can someone be to plan a vacation, based on someone else's dream vacation and then rub it in their face for months!",
            "I'm still utterly baffled by this. Why would you bring this up with his parents? They're going on a trip you'd like to go on and therefore they shouldn't talk about it? You're a grown-arse woman OP, fucking act like it. Will this be response to issues like this your whole life? Any time you're jealous of others you'll ask them not to talk about the thing you're jealous of so as not to cause you discomfort? Your BF's parents were exceedingly polite considering your shocking manners, I would have laughed you out of the room. Grow up.",
            "What a messed up family!",
            "Phew.... sounds like you dodged a big bullet there with that family.",
            "Wow. That update is unbelievable. Good riddance, I am so so sorry.",

            "So, you lost a spineless mommy's boy with insane parents. Honestly kinda sounds like they did you a favor.",
            "What incredibly horrible people. Move on, work hard, save money, go to Japan on your own terms. It's not going anywhere, you have time :)",
            "What a strange thing to say. I mean, if she really were manipulating you, she wouldn't just call you and tell you all about it, not unless she'd know you were already in an inescapable situation and wanted to gloat. In which case she'd probably break up with you for Jack and then bring it up. If she did try to manipulate you and it just didn't work, she just had the perfect thing to switch to: tell Jack all about how you're such a bitter and ungrateful person. A longer game, sure, but she probably could weave something out of that.\n\nOn the other hand, if she weren't manipulating you, and was just offended that you wanted her to tone it down because she wanted to make you plain old jealous, why would she make up something that makes her look even worse? Admitting she wanted to make you jealous is much less horrible than admitting she wanted to make you jealous because you're inferior and her son deserves someone better.\n\nWhat an utterly weird situation and family. Glad you're out of all that. ",
            "WOWWWWWWWW.\n\nI know it feels terrible now, OP, but man did you ever dodge a bullet. What kind of elitist psychopaths would pull something like that? And let's not even get into the f-ed up fact that Jack wouldn't even talk to his own parents about this (I bet on some level he knew) and then let his mom break up with you for him? L O L @ his immature ass.\n\nYou sound like a wonderful girl, and I hope you get to go to Japan someday soon. Good on you for being done with this family and its dysfunction.",
            ">EDIT: Jack's mom called me on the phone a couple of hours ago. In a nutshell, she told me very spitefully that they brought it up to me so frequently to make me jealous. She said they were hoping I would eventually break down and beg them to pay for me to come - that way they could show Jack that I am of a lesser social standing and \"not a good fit\" for him. Then, she basically broke up with me for Jack over the phone (wtf?). I am honestly at such a loss here, maybe this was just a lie she made up because she was offended but even so it's incredibly hurtful. I have no idea if Jack knows about any of this but I don't care, I am done with him and them, I do not want to be associated with such classist, manipulative people. This was such a terrific waste of three years of my life.\n\nWell perhaps you dodged a bullet by staying with a guy who won't speak up on your behalf about a topic that is upsetting you [I think that your jealousy, while isn't necessarily right, is completely understandable but something you need to work on perhaps - but it was hurting you for valid reasons non-the-less and he should have spoken up about your discomfort to his parents] *or* who's parents that are actively bullying a 23 year old [in the hopes that it'd end in a break-up]. I mean, you definitely *don't* want to be entangled in that childish and unnecessary drama for life!\n\nI know you mentioned you have a job lined up so it's not possible for you to visit there, but at the end of the day you just need to then realize that it's down to you. We have choices in life and if you are choosing a career path that won't offer you the same opportunities, that is just that: your choice. I am not saying you shouldn't prioritize your career path or that you should be making compromises to be able to see a place you've always wanted to go [trust me, I know that feeling! husband and I are dying to go to Japan ourselves!], but that means you have to also realize that it's possible to visit in time. You just need to work your buns off and save. If you are willing to save hard and make sacrifices, you'll be able to go sooner rather than later. In fact, putting your career first *is* important because the better position you put yourself in, the more likely you'll be able to visit Japan because you'll have yourself in a more stable place. It might not hurt, though, to take a year off and maybe just teach english in Japan if it's that important to you? Taking a year off might set you back career wise, but it also might not [I don't know what your career area is like to be honest]. Perhaps there are graduate degree or study programs where you can go there and still further your education? Worth looking into.\n\n**EDIT** : Also, forgot to add that, while I don't think you did anything wrong when speaking up for yourself, in future maybe just bring it up as/when it happens. In that scenario, you would be giving it more real context [and maybe making it less of a big deal] and at least your boyfriend would have been there to witness it so he'd have a fighting chance of baking you up - as I assume now it'll turn into a your word against his parent's. I.E. they say \"oh we just booked such-and-such activity in Japan! We are so excited! blahblahblah\" and you respond with \"Oh, that sounds fun. Actually, I just wanted to say that I am excited for you guys to have this trip but I am also a bit bummed out as you know I've wanted to go there for some time. I'm being irrationally jealous and I'm trying to work on that, but if you could also refrain from giving me all the details, it would help me out greatly as I end up fixating on what I'm missing out on. Again, it's nothing you've done, it's me and I do think you'll have a great time, I just get too upset knowing what I'd be missing\". Or *something* along those lines - even if you have no intention to work on yourself, etc., it would just be a bit of a formality I guess. Again, just to re-iterate, what you did definitely was't wrong, I just would have gone about it a bit differently. ",

That is something you should have discussed with a therapist so you can work on the root of your problem.  \n\nYou cannot expect other people to censor themselves to protect your feelings.

            "Honestly, OP, you made a serious social mistake in asking your in-laws to stop being verbally excited about their vacation JUST because you are jealous. I'm shocked you even had that nerve to tell them that they were upsetting you. What right do you have to rain on their parade? They're gushing about it because they're EXCITED and they felt that you were someone they could share their excitement with, but you basically have shut them down and made them feel incredibly uncomfortable around you. Congrats for that. I'd be uncomfortable around you too if I were them. \n\nWho wants a dictating, sensitive, self-centered, daughter in-law forcing them to censor their talking conversations because you don't know how deal with your own personal feelings? Why punish them for your insecurities, OP? \n\nI don't blame your boyfriend for finding it difficult to stand up for you. He knows your being silly and overly sensitive. He may have been sympathetic since you can't help how you feel, but you or him going to his parents is OUT OF LINE. They are not responsible for your mental well-being and they deserve the opportunity to share excitement with loved ones. ",
            "You were really rude. I don't get why people just can't be happy for others... I know you are upset you can't go but being petty and jealous is not the answer. You'd be at a better place in life when you learn to be happy for others :)",

            "So I have read the OP, update and the subsequent edit. As everyone else has said, the first red flag is Jack not talking to his parents about your feelings. That's absolutely his place to do so, and while you did well in taking up his slack there, his parents are just straight up assholes. I'd steer clear of all of them, and in the future you can look back on this as a learning experience.",
            "As much as I'm trying to believe you, I noticed your post has been edited and it almost appears like while they appear to be spiteful people, can you admit to a degree of polishing this with selfishness  too?  The fact that you're bothered by it and a tad petty with some of the context of your writing?  \n\nPeople want to side with you but it's hard when you've admitted to a sense of immaturity and selfishness glossed over the pettiness from the parents.\n\nI'm not trying to be mean here, but it's hard when it looks like \"poor me\" with the edits and measure of how this impacted a trip to Japan.  I'm sorry, but other trips will come.  You can still go, but I think you're being a bit dramatic aside from the point that his family are ridiculous.  Furthermore, it's weird how you have weekly dinners and then this situation occurred.  It doesn't add up.  It seems there's been some underlying issues that had you stepped back wouldn't have happened and if it's true that the family doesn't like you, there shouldn't have been other times that this raised a red flag and it not boil down to just this one event.  There had to be other issues.  Sorry, but there was probably more to this relationship and the Japan trip.  This was just the one time everything blew up.\n",
            "I have to respectfully disagree with your post. From what's been conveyed it doesn't seem logical that his parents were being \"indirectly rude\".  To a degree, this isn't about your affected feelings.   This is a out two parents who are excited to get a vacation.\n\nLet's take for example someone trying to buy a house and were excited they bought one. It was their first house ever, but you lost your house a few years back and it was either similar to the house this new person bought or even better, in the same neighborhood, but yours was foreclosed due to whatever reason. The sense that people have to \"tone down\" their excitement for other people really doesn't have to be tolerated in cases like this.  Yes, it can be outright annoying when they boast on and on about it, but that's life.\n\nThere are going to be fun and exciting that come you're way too and when they do you'll want the ability to rave about it too... Whether it be a trip to Japan or something brand new on your life.  For a sec, it almost felt like you were unhappy with someone else's excitement (the parents) and approached them about how it affected you. They really don't have to tone it down because of the issue concerning your rejection.  Chances are they didn't think about that when they planned the trip.  In other words, it's not about you.\n\nI know that sounds harsh and mean, but they were extactic  and happy.  This is something that they're very happy about.  Same thing goes for females when they get married and start wedding planning. Would you ever say something to someone about your feelings being impacted if you had issues with weddings?\n\nThere's going to come a time when things will be thrilling for you and all you'll do is rave about it.  When that time comes, are you going to want someone who is affected by it to tell you to \"tone it down\"?\n\nAll of us can have the ability to be excited over stuff.  There is going to come a time where you'll have the chance too.",

            "My MIL tried to do something similar: Invited my husband on a trip-of-a-lifetime and specifically said it was \"for family only\". \n\nI'm not sure how she thought it would work, but she's always tried to use her money to manipulate and control him. Where it would have worked with his brother (he would have left his partner in a heartbeat) my husband just reminded her (for the umteenth time) that I AM HIS FAMILY. \n\nStrangely enough, when DH refused her oh-so-generous offer, no one ended up going. It's too bad, really. She's now dying of cancer, will never get to make that trip, and has completely lost the love of her youngest child. ",
            "Man this thread is cancer.\n\nOP: you were out of line, that's all there is to it. If you actually want an adult big-kid relationship, I suggest apologising profusely for your poisonous attack on their happiness and family holiday.\n\n> I had hoped that by making the conversation more focused on my behavior than theirs, it would deflect the blame from them and feel like less of a direct attack.\n\nThat sums it up - it *was* an attack - you wanted to change them instead of just working on your own issues, and they seem to have rightfully picked up on that fact.",
            "Jack is weak sauce. He can't handle disagreeing with his parents, to the point where he will outright gaslight you and make it seem like he never supported you even though you both know he damn well did. He refused to even talk to them on your behalf about a minor little thing like this. Basically where his mom and dad are concerned, he's got no spine. Is this something you'll be able to live with in future - say, if you two end up married or have kids? Will he be able to deal with it if his parents overstep, or will he automatically take their side against you? Given that he couldn't deal with something small, there's no way in hell he's gonna be good for the big things. It will always be a point of contention between you two unless he grows up and becomes an adult.\n\nFrankly, his parents are no better.

A 23 year old who cannot speak to his parents is a boy, not a man. That his mommy and daddy have their little boy (and you) over every single week is kinda nice. It shows that they're close. But it's also sometimes a sign that their little boy will always be a little boy who will never grow up. My ex also went over to eat his momma's food every week to the age of 30.

            "I think you've just found out that you've vastly overestimated your standing with Jack and his family.  If Jack truly understood your financial situation, he should have shut down the trip offers OR offered to pay for you long before Japan came up.  Instead, he refused to support you.  Your choice was continue to deal with hearing about yet another trip or talk to his parents.  You thought his parents would be receptive to your thoughts and feelings, and neither one cared.  You ended up being wrong about Jack and his parents.\n\nIt was far easier for them to excommunicate you from their lives than to say \"Oh, we didn't realize it was so important to you.  We'll stop bringing up our trips until you're able to join us.  See you at dinner!\"  Neither Jack nor his parents could show you the common decency of telling you to your face their decision.\n\nYes, it's selfish to expect people to dance around your feelings like that...BUT it's also incredibly rude to continue to discuss detailed trip plans when someone has made it's clear they can't/aren't going.  Doesn't matter the reasons AT ALL.  It's one thing to say \"Hey, we're going out of town to COUNTRY on DATES\", but to continually go on and on about a trip in front of someone who isn't going is rude.\n\nI travel a lot and it's just common courtesy to not rub trip plans in someone else's face.

Jack might want to string you along a bit longer, but who wants to date someone who doesn't care about your feelings and neither does his parents?

I get that. But you're a 23-year-old girlfriend and although you're both adults, that is still young. In his parents' eyes, you're pretty much still kids. Especially since y'all got together at 20. Making a special visit to speak with your boyfriend's (not fiance, not husband) parents to explain that something harmless to anyone else is upsetting you and they should stop probably isn't a good idea. Even some reasonable people would be weirded out by that. I'm not saying it is right for them to feel that way, but really.. this was your boyfriend's place. Stepping in and taking care of issues with a SO's family members when you're not even married is really just a bad, bad idea. I know you're all adults and it shouldn't be that way, but that's just kinda how it is. Many parents would take what you did the wrong way.",

What the fuck is wrong with these people?

            "You poor thing. You did well, remember that. Don't let Jack tell you otherwise, he's the coward. You shouldn't have had to face his parents especially alone, but I think you did a good job. You tried to prevent it from sounding accusatory and the fact that they instantly shut you down goes to show that they might not be very empathic/compassionate people. \n\nAt 3 years a relationships is usually reaching a point where it's fairly serious and might lead to a future together. Jack is not supporting you. While he does need to prevent too strong f a bias towards either side, he is your partner and should have your back for things like this. You didn't ask for anything unreasonable. You just discussed your feelings. If he can't admit his fault, he might not be in it for the long run. \n\nYou're starting a new job soon, and I'm assuming recently finished school or still are in school. Your cancelled plans to go to Japan are still recent and your feelings are understandably still fresh. He should be more compassionate towards your feelings in this matter. My partner's parents are going in a cruise soon but they don't rub it all in my face everytime I go there, nor my partner's face. They talk about it here and there but nothing too extreme. To be honest though, anyone going on any trip bragging about it to close friends/family who aren't so lucky are wing sort of douchy. Even if you weren't dreaming of going to Japan, bragging about it so much is still a kind of selfish/narcissistic thing to do and a bit insensitive. \n\nIt's really up to you how to move forward, but I personally would advise having a serious discussion with your boyfriend as soon as you can. Ask him perhaps why is suddenly being so cold about the whole situation. Maybe there's something he's not telling you. Either way, if you can't resolve this in a way that makes you able to (someday) forgive both him and his parents, it might be best to just move on.",

He said that if you politely asked his parents to tone down their gushing (which he *acknowledged* was insensitive), they would. Then he acts as though *you* were rude for bringing it up, though it sounds like you did you graciously. \n\nSecondly, his parents are assholes. \"I'm sorry you're offended,\" translates into \"you've offended us by taking issue with our behaviour.\" Have you ever felt before that you weren't allowed to disagree with his parents?\n\nSo, not only do they gloat about a trip that you wanted (and made no effort to invite you, they just wanted to rub it in your face), they are offended that you don't take their shit with a smile. And then they give you the silent treatment. After three years of dating their son and being  a part of their family, you deserve better than that. Not to be cast out the second you bring up a valid issue. \n\nJack threw you to the wolves and is denying any responsibility. His parents have cast you out for daring to be hurt by their hurtful behaviour. No one in this family has your back. I don't think there's any coming back from this.",
            "I'll go against the grain here. You should have never confronted them, and you should have sucked it up and put on a smile and pretended to be happy for them. Every day I see someone with something I don't have, do I go and confront them about it and tell them to keep it away because my \"feelings are hurt\"? No, I don't. You're not a special snowflake OP, despite what popular media and a large portion of this sub tells you. I would have broken up with a girl who has special snowflake syndrome as well.",
            "OMG, I thought his parents were just being rude and inconsiderate...this is just on a whole nother level! While I say screw them, I'd still want to hear my boyfriend of three years do the breaking up to believe that's what he wants. Not advocating you stay together, just now you know you can't trust his parents to be decent human beings, so they could be just making shit up because they want y'all to break up and he might not have any idea they told you all that. I think it's a bit unlikely since he took their side, but I think if I were you I'd still need to have a talk with him. Sending you some internet hugs! (My dream is to go to Japan too!)",

Fuck their whole family dynamic, weird passive aggressiveness, unnecessary bullshit, ect. Go do something worth your time then deal with snobby uppity asshats. You know what kind people do that have that much more money? They offer to take you because they want you to experience it with them. Rather than trying to bait you into begging to humiliate you.\n\nFlip the bird and walk away knowing that you still have your dignity.",

            "One, you were petty and childish to complain to his parents about their enthusiasm, regardless of your \"dreams\". You should have just smiled politely and left them to their excitement. You were jealous...adults get over it.\n\nTwo, your husband is spineless. He pretends to support your feelings but sends you off on your own to childishly confront his parents, and when that goes over like a lead balloon, suddenly he's on mommy and daddy's side?? \n\nThree, the in laws were definitely insensitive, bordering on being braggarts about the trip. BUT...it's their time and money and they can go wherever the hell they want. Their trip is not about you. Perhaps they were even trying to warmly share some of the excitement with you? Even if they were just being shamefully ignorant, I don't blame them in the least for being cold to you. You had no right to impose your petty feelings on them. Your jealousy is not their problem.\n\nMy in laws and my sister are both world travellers, and both have been to places that are dream destinations for me. I would never push my envy upon them and insist they shut up about it all. They are all entitled to their adventures and my support of their fun. Worst case, just bloody smile and nod...you might maintain some semblance of maturity.",

            "Ouch. Wow. Okay so unempathetic boyfriend and unempathetic parents. Coupled with your boyfriend refusing to support you or talk to his parents. \n\nMassive, glaring red flags here. \n\nI don't even know you and my heart hurts for you. \n\nIn high school my boyfriend went on a trip and got to swim with dolphins. That was my dream, but my family was too poor to make that happen. When he got back he didn't rub it in. He was super sensitive and actually said he felt almost like he was cheating on me because he got to live my dream. I was in no way mad at him and his empathetic response really helped with my jealously. \n\nYour boyfriend is being insensitive. And after seeing his parents response I can completely see why. If I recall in your post you struggle majorly financially and they don't seem to grasp your poverty. Not all wealthy people will have this thought process but some will. In my experience having my SO be understanding and sensitive to my financial past and present is essential to the relationship working.\n\nI don't know if your relationship can go any further. He doesn't seem to \"get\" it and worst of all he won't support you with his parents. This is a big deal and seriously worth ending the relationship over. ",
            "People don't want to see your jealousy or envy. Sometimes, admitting to them that you were jealous, envious, and petty can raise their sympathy, but it can also make you seem like a small person who can't be happy for others. \n\nIf they are rich, they are going to keep doing things that you wish you could. Their life constantly inspires jealousy. It doesn't make sense to keep people close who are jealous like that.",
            "His parents are dicks. Your bf left you out to dust and isn't supportive. \n\nBe glad you're not going on this trip. Especially as translator where they paid for you to go. You'll see their true colours when they think of you as \"paid help\".\n\nSit down with your BF and ask him if this was anyone but his parents would he have acted this way. If yes, then why stay with him? If no, then determine why his parents being involved change the dynamic. Act accordingly.\n\nPeople are gonna do things you can't do. Ultimately, you are responsible for your life and you have to persevere through emotional adversity. You'll go on your trip one day, no doubt. Don't invite bf or his parents.",

            "His parents are rude as fuck. I can see them discussing in great detail a lavish meal they had at an exclusive restaurant in front of a hungry, poor person and then having an attitude when you ask to change the subject because it's only making you hungrier. And they're immature. I'd STOP CONTACTING THEM without an apology, including no more dinners. You've made the overture. It's their turn now, and if your boyfriend doesn't stand up for you at all, then that means you come third in his life, after mom and dad, even with the matter directly affects you. ",
            "I think this whole relationship between him and his family and you and his family has probably been fucked up for a while. I say that because to me it seems weird that you're having dinner with his parents every week, and they can not pick up on your discomfort. I mean to me it's just weird to have dinner with your in laws so frequently anyway. But if you spend that much time around people there should be a strong sense of intimacy and trust. To me it seems there is no intimacy or trust there. You seem more like a body occupying a seat at the table rather than a human being. ",
            "Honestly you were being over sensitive about the whole issue. So you don't get to go to Japan right now.  That doesnt mean people can't talk about it around you. Use it as drive to save up more u till you can go. ",
            "Man OP, I'm sorry things took a turn that way. I want to reassure you that I don't think you were unreasonable at all. If anything, it was unfair of Jack to ask you to go to his parents. He should have done that himself but as I see it, he selfishly didn't want that potentially uncomfortable talk *or* he never really had your side at all and therefore couldn't go to them himself. Either way I think your reconsidering the relationships is wise on your part. I know that must be hard. All the best.",
            "Why did this happen? Because your boyfriend hasn't grown up enough to stand up for his partner to his parents. He could have graciously taken them aside and been like, \"It is a huge dream of GF to go to Japan one day and I would love to go with her once she doesn't have work keeping her here. I think it is bumming her out to hear about it so much. Can we keep the details at a minimum in the meantime?\" \n\nBut no, he didn't do that, and threw you under the bus. K. \n\nPersonally, I think you made a mistake once you spoke to them directly and alone. And that's not your fault. You're not their daughter. You are their son's girlfriend, and they don't have to like you. This is why this subreddit always encourages the child to intervene with the offensive in law, because the parent has much more difficulty cutting off their own kid. This is a good example of why. I'm sorry, because it's not your fault, it is more of a political maneuver, and ultimately Jack refused to do it. You have a boyfriend problem. \n\nAnyway. Give it some time, but if Jack is so determined to side with his parents over you then he can marry them.\n\n",

            "I'm so sorry this happened to you.\n\nI also had to deal with my (ex)boyfriend and his family, who traveled for 1 month to Japan, the place I really wanted to visit someday. I even took japanese courses in university, but I had no money and my mother was not able to afford any trips because we were broke.\n\nI was really jealous and hurt, of course, just like you. My ex boyfriend left one month, leaving me behind during the only 1 month vacation I had between two jobs. He was 25yo and still prefered to travel each summer in very expensive trips paid by mommy/daddy instead of traveling with me in cheaper destinations. But more important, he couldn't act like a grown adult during our whole relationship. He wasn't willing to put our relationship first. \n\nI think that you dodge a bullet with this one. What lead you to be jealous might also be the fact that your ex wasn't willing to give you enought space in his life. I understood that only several months after he broke up with me by sms. He tried during our whole relationship to make me believe that I was a selfish, stupid person and that I had to, basically, STFU (even when he was hanging with his ex in restaurants for lunch time). Please do not believe anything he said about you ! Your ex's parents sound really shitty, and you have to understand that there is nothing you can do if your ex is not willing to grow-up and to care about your feelings. Big red flag when I read about his reaction when you reported the mama's cold speech.\n\nEven if it hurt like hell, I advise you to do the no-contact thing and to move forward. Don't waste your time. He's doomed anyway.\n\nEDIT : I also think that it was a mistake to talk to them about this. His family is obviously a huge problem to build a healthy relationship, but you ex is the one who should have done something. He is the real problem here, not his parents or the travel.",
            "I would make it a point to tell anyone who knows you are Jack what happened. Make sure anyone in the community knows about. People this classist deserve to be outed for it and putting a strain on their relations with others seems like a fair way to separate friends or relations you might have in common. \n\nIf one of my friends threw another friend under the bus like this, especially his girlfriend or her boyfriend I wouldn't want to be around that person. ",
            "I think you handled the situation extremely maturely, OP! Your BF and his parents' reactions show that they are obviously immature and petty. Frankly, you're the bigger person here; you spoke up about your feelings and were completely upfront about it, as opposed to making snide little passive aggressive comments when the parents spoke  about their trip. \nHonestly, you sound well rid of them!

            "> In a nutshell, she told me very spitefully that they brought it up to me so frequently to make me jealous. She said they were hoping I would eventually break down and beg them to pay for me to come - that way they could show Jack that I am of a lesser social standing and \"not a good fit\" for him. \n\nOh what the hell...\n\nAnyone else wondering if the trip was actually real? ",
            "Wow.  Just wow.  What awful people.  Good on you for walking away from this terrible family, that is some ghastly crappy behaviour.  Onwards and upwards, m'dear.  What's the bet his mother will spend her entire holiday in Japan gritting her teeth and spitefully thinking of you, instead of relaxing and enjoying herself?  ",
            "You should tell him what she said to you. He's weak, and I think you're better without him, but hearing what she said might be enough for him to realise how controlling his parents are, and help him be better person in future. And if you don't say anything then he'll definitely just believe whatever lies his mum tells him about it. \n\nMake sure it's clear you have no interest in staying with him, and are just letting him know for his benefit. He'll be more inclined to believe you if you have nothing to gain from it.",
            "The fact that Jack wouldn't have the conversation with his parents in the first place means he NEVER had you back.  \n\nI'm sorry Jack and his parents are super shitty human beings.",

He's actually taking his mother's side against you.\n\n\nJack's dad is staying out of things because he's not going to speak against his wife on your behalf. Maybe he's the on your side, but you'll never actually know about that.\n\n\nJack is very immature for a 23 year old and a bit of a snob. Unless things change dramatically after all this is pointed out, I'd say it's a deal breaker.",
            "Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry you had to experience this! I was so hopeful after reading your first post that they were planning to surprise you with a trip. For them to hope that you would beg them to pay for you is disgusting and her comment on social standing is abhorrent (did you tell her it's 2016, not 1916?). On the plus side, you dodged a bullet. Though you're sad about your BF (or should I say BF's Mom) breaking up with you, you want a partner that is going to support you and listen to you when you feel upset, not jump the fence and leave you high and dry! You will get to Japan one day, there's no doubt about that! You are already so successful and will only continue to do so. At this moment, be excited that you've got an incredible placement lined up - one that is only going to continue to advance you academically and professionally. Japan will always be there! Additionally, if this is who they are at their core, you wouldn't want to experience Japan with them anyway :) Good luck OP, now go and show your placement who is BOSS! ",
            "On the upside, if it is true that they planned this trip to Japan for the sole purpose of manipulating your relationship into failure, then it's very likely that they won't be enjoying their vacation very much.

            "You've already gotten a ton of comments, but I just have to say this: I know I don't know your situation, you said you already have a job lined up, but I still believe you can figure out how to get to Japan sometime in the near future. I used to think big trips to other countries were only for rich people, too. They're not. My now-husband has opened my eyes to this. If you budget for it, look into when the cheapest airline flights are, stay in hostels or airbnbs, etc. it is doable. r/travel might be able to help you figure out the cheapest way to travel in Japan. Even if you don't get to do every single thing you've always wanted, or you only get to stay 5 days, or whatever, at least you will have gone. I get stressed about the money every time I go on an international trip, and EVERY TIME I get home KNOWING it was worth every penny. Experiences are worth so much more than money. You can go back again in 5-10 years and really do it up, but for now I think you owe it to yourself as a way to get over your shitty boyfriend to get there asap. Best of luck to you, no one deserves to be treated the way you were, and you handled the entire situation with grace and class. ",

This was such a terrific waste of three years of my life.\n\nJack deserves to know they told you that. Even if just in an email to him. Whether you stay in his life or not, whether they meant it or not, he needs to know that his crappy parents are willing to do something like that. I can understand (not excuse) his denial of supporting you initially if he is under the thumb of such awful people.... \n\nAlso, this may just be another effort at \"getting rid of you.\"",
            "Is this real life??\n\nOP I'm so sorry this happened. What a mindfuck. What they're doing is completely unreasonable. It'd be worth overlooking (for me anyway) if your BF vehemently had your back, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. Even then it really sucks having those people in your life. \n\nYou're 23, you're young. You can do anything in the world you want to do. Your absolute best revenge is to live well and build your life. Then down the line when Jack realizes he fucked up and tries to come back, you and your new SO can laugh in his face. \n\nWhen my mother and father started dating in college (former USSR), my grandmother (dad's side) constantly belittled her and thought that she was a dumb farm girl. She never thought my mom was \"good enough\" for my dad. She still doesn't. My dad didn't give one fuck. Now my grandma lives alone trying to guilt my sister and I into seeing her, but after seeing the way she treated our mother our whole lives we couldn't give less of a fuck. And my mother is still happily married to my father and they are doing quite well and have a wonderful life together.\n\nSo in short fuck his parents. Even in the best case scenario where he has your back, it's not pleasant to grow up with a MIL and FIL that look down on you. ",

            "You seem like a very smart girl and I'm sorry that you have to deal with such ridiculous people. I'm sure when you spoke with them, you were very sensitive and thoughtful. I may sound cold and I hope not to offend you but these people would be a nightmare as in laws. The fact that your boyfriend changed his stance on the subject based on his parents reaction is an indication that he not yet his own man, and god knows when that will happen. If they were kind people they would have understood or even have invited you to go along, I know that's what my parents would have done."

Eventually though, you cannot live your life trying to make someone else happy, or stay with someone because you feel sorry for them. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to do this, and it's going to be extremely difficult for a long while. You just have to rip off the band-aid and do what your heart tells you to do. He will live, and you both will move on to the next chapter in your lives.   ",

He was unstable a lot of the time and also has moments where i thought he'd kill himself. \n\nHonestly, you are not his everything, and he is manipulating you into thinking that so its harder to leave. If you were his everything, he would have stepped up and grown with you, in order to keep you HAPPY, not just keep you. \n\nMake a plan on how to leave, get your finances and housing in order then just rip off the band aid.

Yeah, that happens with most unwanted breakups. That's just life.\n\nIf you mean 'ruining his life'. Yeah, no. He has been coasting partially because he's had you to fall back on. When you break up with him, it will cause some difficulties in his life, but he is stronger than you both give him credit for. He will deal and cobble some kind of life together.

It's important at this point to be stern and not let him start arguments about why to stay, and to simply tell him it won't work, and you are moving out.\n\nThe planning you did before is crucial so that you can move out quickly. If theres a delay between your new place and the break up, try to crash at friends or familys place in the mean time. Staying in the same place as your now ex will usually make things very difficult for both of you.\n\nWhen you are completely separated, block him from all social media, and block his number. There is nothing to be gained from leaving access to each other.\n\nIt's gonna suck, and you are gonna cry a lot, even though you initiated it, you will hurt badly.

I knew I was done with the relationship (had also finished school was financially stable etc). I think the turning point for me was knowing that I had caregiver fatigue and was essentially being emotionally abused. When I did end people told me I actually seemed happy.

He would tell me that he\u2019d be dead without me. \n\nIn our time together I graduated university, moved cities, established myself in a fantastic career.  Meanwhile.. he dropped out of university to be with me when I finished (he started a few years after me). He changed jobs multiple times (each time *I* got him the initial interview at the very least), and every single month there was an \u2018issue\u2019 with his paycheque.  He insisted that everything was down to his mental heath issues, and I believed him. He relied on me for financial security AND mental stability, it was all too much.  \n\nFor so long I wanted to end things because he was bringing me down and he was so unwilling to help himself, but I persevered because I worried that without me he would be homeless, penniless and suicidal.   In the end I realised that actually it wasn\u2019t my problem to be concerned about.  He is a grown-ass adult who needs to learn how to care for himself.  \n\nWe sat down together and I explained to him why I was ending things. I explained that whilst I still cared for him, I did not have the energy to live my own life if I had to keep him afloat every day too.  I said \u201cI can\u2019t be happy for the both of us all of the time\u201d.  He didn\u2019t put up much of an argument, and I respect that.  He was devastated but he said he loved me too much to see me unhappy for his own sake.  I would hope that your SO will have this mindset too. Sorry for rambling! \n\nTLDR - You need to put yourself first. He is a grown man who ultimately can look after himself.

Go cold turkey once your shit is sorted; don't try to be friends because that will make it harder on him. Give him space. If this kickstarts his life as an adult, great.

            "I was in this situation a couple years ago as well - I was with a guy for 6 years, throughout my early/mid 20's, and during that time I finished my degree, started my career, and became financially stable. I grew up, basically.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure if this is the case for you, but in my case, these changes in my life totally altered the power dynamic between us, which caused problems. In retrospect, I don't think either of us knew how to deal with that power shift. I became the \"breadwinner\", paid for rent, groceries, did most of the housework, etc. I absolutely hated it. Not because I necessarily disliked doing any of those things (except the housework lol), but because this guy just let me take everything over without ever really offering to pick up any of the slack. He didn't have a job, and wasn't actively looking for one. Then, understandably, he got depressed and totally stopped advocating for himself and developed a serious online gaming problem. \"Serious\" meaning that if he had a bad game, it would totally ruin his mood, make him extremely irritable, I had to walk on eggshells just to have a normal conversation. He'd play pretty much all day every day, so this applied all the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the same time as this unhealthy behavior was going on, though, he'd also tell me that he loves me deeply, I'm the best thing in his life, I'm the best thing that has ever happened to him, etc. If that was true then why wasn't he trying to better himself so that we could better ourselves as a couple as well?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI ended up breaking up with him pretty suddenly at one point because I just couldn't take it anymore. He later told me that although the breakup was really awful emotionally for him, it was the kick in the butt he needed to... well... get off his butt. He ended up going to a trade school and then starting his own business, and is now by all accounts pretty successful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess ultimately I'd advise breaking up, unless he has very immediate & very concrete plans to do something to help himself out of this. My experience is that you can't really force growing up, and if he's not ready, then he's not ready, and you should move on to somebody who's more on your level. Ten years is a long time for this to be going on. How much longer are you willing to deal with this?",

I point out all the signs: no intimacy for years now, no common interests, often don't enjoy each others company, etc.  But when I talk about this he completely falls apart and tells me he would die without me.  He's the kind of man who has always had someone take care of him in many ways, so I know he wouldn't be OK on his own.  So I try to get him to go back to his ex.  His ex wants him back, but he doesn't want to go.  The only way I could end this is if I walked out the door and left him in crisis, and I just can't do that to him, or anyone.  I would feel terrible, and I would be so worried about him.  I have friends and family that have been telling me for a long time that that is precisely what I need to do, but I can't be that mean.  The only way I'm going to be able to move on is if I can convince him to agree with me, so that it's mutual.  I've been trying to do that for years now.

If you were to ask, he'd tell you that it's because he had his heart broken. But after 2.5 years, it can't be about me anymore. He was depressed waaaaaaaay before I left him.

        "selftext": "I hope you'll bear with me here, because I have a lot of family members. I come from a religious community that doesn't believe in the public school system and tends to have a ton of kids. \n\nI have an older sister \"Julia\" 27f, a step brother \"Ron\" 22m, a step sister \"Molly\" 17f, a half-brother \"Joe\" 13m, and a half-sister \"Lucy\" 11f. \n\nGrowing up, all of us were \u201chomeschooled.\u201d This involved a lot of neglect, lack of textbooks or seasonally appropriate clothes/shoes, unheated house, and sometimes physical abuse. I lived mostly with my mom, but spent weekends with my step family. Both houses were dysfunctional. My step mom used to have a severe problem with alcoholism, although she\u2019s been better in the last few years.\n\nRon is my best friend and I would be lost without him. We\u2019ve supported each other through years of hard times, and we discuss a lot how our lives could have been different if we\u2019d been sent to school or generally had a more healthy home life. Obviously, we don\u2019t want the same thing for our younger siblings, and don\u2019t want to see them struggling in minimum wage jobs while trying to study for a GED the way we\u2019re doing.\n\nWhen I went to visit him recently I found that my step mom had gone out of the country for an ENTIRE WEEK and left the youngest two at the house. Ron and Molly both work (Molly hasn\u2019t been doing any \u201chomeschooling\u201d for about 2 years) and are out of the house for most of the day and night. \n\nI tried to help Lucy with her math homework, but she was extremely behind grade level and kept getting distracted because she had to make lunch or do chores. Joe spends all day in his room playing video games and gets no guidance from anyone. I tried to (as gently as possible) get him to do some reading, but he doesn\u2019t understand how serious the situation is, and obviously is having too much fun to care. \n\nSo I called CPS and reported educational neglect.\n\nAnd obviously everyone knew it was me.\n\nAnd Ron told me that Stepmom said I wasn\u2019t welcome at the house anymore and to never contact any of them again.\n\nMolly is extremely mad at me. She blocked me on Facebook and doesn\u2019t have a cellphone where I can reach her.\nJulia, who somehow heard about all this despite living across the country, also blocked me on Facebook, and reported my Facebook as impersonating a celebrity, (Facebook deleted it, generally making everything harder).\n\nThis stings even more because I\u2019m already estranged from my biomom over my religious beliefs. I now have no family members left (besides Ron, thank bejeebus) who want anything to do with me. I feel like I make enemies everywhere I go.\n\nDid I do the right thing? Ron has been saying for years that he \"can't\" call CPS, and I guess this is why, but at least he doesn't blame me. He suggested that I try to talk to Stepmom once some time has passed, but I would have no idea where to begin.\n\n  **tl;dr**: I called CPS because my youngest two siblings are being educationally neglected. My whole family is now shunning me and I don't know if it's appropriate, reasonable, or even possible to try to reconcile with them either now or when we've all cooled off.",

Petition Facebook to get your profile reinstated (I'm assuming you weren't really impersonating someone else). Keep that profile up so the others can reach you when they're ready. \n\nAlso, there are great ex-homeschooled support groups online. You aren't the only one who's been through this.

In a way, it has nothing to do with you. They would demonize anyone who challenged their denial. \n\nWhat that means is, you won't be able to reconcile until either you are willing to say you were wrong and all the terrible things they said about you were correct (don't do this) or until enough time has passed that they can go into denial that it ever happened. \n\nIn the meantime, it's sounds like you're not flush with cash, but if there's any avenue to get counseling, you should look into it.

I think you knew the consequences but you also knew that talking to your step-mom about your concerns would have been unproductive.\n\nI'm not surprised a lot of your family reacted this way.  You need to remember, CPS has no magic wand to wave that will make your younger half-siblings suddenly get a better education while remaining at home with the family that loves them.  They are outsiders, and they can take kids away from families.  Also, there's a huge stigma associated with getting the attention of CPS.  \n\nWhen you feel sad about feeling cut off from your family, remember that you chose to accept that consequence in order to help Lucy and Joe.  If they get a better education, if they grow up better because of you, it'll be worth it.",

At 17, living at home, she may not think it's a problem, or realize how unnecessarily hard/ limited her adult life will be without a decent education.\n\n\nIf Molly won't deal with you, see if Ron can talk to her. Now that CPS is going to step in and make sure your sibs are getting an education, you don't want her to be stubbornly uncooperative just because she's mad at you. She also has a lot of power to set the tone for Joe and Lucy; hopefully she/Ron can start to counteract the neglectful attitude your moms have toward education.\n\n\n_Btw, what's Julia's deal?

            "Doing the right thing often comes with unwarranted consequences.\n\nI was a whistleblower at my last job, it was a weird situation. One brother was the owner but would just pop in every once in awhile to make decisions, never really working beyond managerial things in the office. The other brother was in charge of the kitchen and accounting and stuff like that. There is a strict policy that all staff had to pay for their food, even the brother who ran things plus the head chef who made the menu and worked just as hard as any cook. The only exception was the owner. Who knows maybe he had a few more exceptions but decided to lie to employees about it.\n\nI started working closing shifts, and noticed that a few people were abusing things and asking for food without ringing it in or paying for it first. I asked the brother who ran the kitchen if that was acceptable and he said no, only cook food that has been rang in first.\n\nShortly after that one of my fellow cooks, who was constantly being made fun of for not being that bright (sad thing is he wasnt stupid he was just intellectually lazy), being lazy (physically), and being gross (he would pick stuff up off the floor and put it on cutting boards or wipe his face with a towel then put it on clean plates), exploded on me and I gave him an earful in return. He called me an asshole, he told me that everybody hated me, he called me a narc... I asked him what the hell was going through his head, to hate me so much and to stick up for thieves, who weren't stealing from some big faceless corporation but rather a small business. How it wasn't fair to those who actually pay for their food.\n\nThe owner decided that he like the other guy more than me and I started losing hours.

You did what was best for the kids though, and hopefully they'll understand that someday, even if you spoiled their freedom and fun in the short term.\n\nSidenote, I just want to throw out there that homeschooling is not always a bad thing. My children are home schooled, though my wife is a certified teacher and does it professionally. Both of my kids are very bright and well above grade level in their education. They have weekly activities and even other group classes with other kids and plenty of friends, so they get plenty of socialization too. The schools in our area are pretty crappy and I don't think bad public schools are necessarily good to subject your kids to if you're trying to raise kind, thoughtful human beings.
