        "selftext": "Again thank you for all the support in the last two posts. You really helped me keep a clear head through all of this. I had no idea reddit could help me so much! \n\nI didn't plan on posting again, but I have surprisingly good news. \n\nOP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3g747t/my_35m_girlfriend_21f_uncomfortable_with_my_wifes/\n\nUpdate: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3gh3a2/update_my_35m_girlfriend_31f_uncomfortable_with/\n\n\nLast night I came home from work to find a framed photo from my wedding hanging on the wall with the chain dangling around it. There was also a 5 page note from M on the coffee table. \n\nI'm not going to type the whole note, because a lot of it was very personal to M. However I will say that there was a LOT of apologizing on her part. She told me that she thought a lot about the ring (and even did some googling) and realized that it's not all that uncommon. She said she was completely embarrassed by her reaction and that she was uncomfortable with the thought of being around ANYBODY'S remains. She called herself disrespectful, childish, and pathetic. :( \n\nM also said that what I did was a beautiful thing, and shows what a sensitive and loving man I am. That she want's to be with me more than anything and doesn't want to change a thing about our tradition (taking the ring traveling). She told me she nows see's that it's a lovely idea and said my wife was lucky to have me and my family. That she as well is lucky to now be a part of my and my family's life. \n\nShe concluded saying that she felt as though we had a good connection and handled conflict well. She said she hopes that I know her well enough to know that this isn't the way she typically reacts (I do). She also told me she was going to get therapy, as she is worried about what will happen once somebody she knows dies. \n\nThe last part of her note said that she left a surprise in my fridge (a 6 pack of my favorite beer) and that she'd love to enjoy them with me if I'll have her. She told me to take all the time I need before calling her and that she hopes someday I'll forgive her for her actions. \n\nI called her immediately. We talked, and she pretty much repeated what she said in her note. I repeated what I said at dinner (that she is my number one, and that I am so sorry for lying about the ring). We have plans to see each other tomorrow night. \n\nI love the photo of me and my wife. I don't have many photos of us, and none that are framed. The chain looks perfect around it, and it's a nice little memorial to have in my home. I love the idea of starting a new home with M, while still having my wife's memory be a part of it.\n\n\nI know this is not what many of you wanted to read. You wanted me to kick M to the curb. However, I think that a year of good actions make up for one bad action. Her apology was genuine and I really do feel as though this won't happen again. If she tries to control something like this again, and I can't resolve it, I guess I know where to post ;) \n\nI can't thank you all enough. \n\n\nEdit: I was expecting you all to be disappointed in me, and yet the first comments are saying how happy you are for me. Thanks again reddit! \n\n**tl;dr**: M made big apology. Forgave her. Happy. ",

            "Congrats on the happy ending!  I think you did the right thing.  she realized that she was in the wrong and that she needs some help.  That was very mature of her and should give you reason to be optimistic about your relationship.  Your situation is one that is very hard for people to understand unless they've been in it.",
            "She owned up to her mistake. I think in this case, that's a big thing. Congrats on the happy ending. :)",
            "People aren't perfect. People fuck up. Sometimes the people in this sub forget that we are given only pieces of a person as seen through someone else's eyes. So don't worry about the people who wanted you to dump her. They don't know M and you clearly do. \nI am very happy for you.",
            "I know this is late, but everyone seems to be dogging your gf with no real life experience. I seriously dated a man who's wife died of cancer at a young age and early in their marriage. After getting serious and moving in together I found it very difficult to deal with their wedding picture hanging on the wall and stacks of photos of her all around the house and her things still all around. I would never have asked that he get rid of these things, but to have it all in my face everywhere I turned, it made me feel very unwelcome, as well as having a noticeable effect on his ability to progress through the stages of grief. After some time I asked if he would be willing to remove the hanging photos and consolidate her things. He said he never could because it was too hard, but I could (a weird spot to be in). I bought a nice wooden box with a frame cover and put a special picture of her on the lid and filled it with the photos and small trinkets and their rings and put it on his dresser and boxed the rest of her things in the closet. He was satisfied with that and seemed to appreciate the care I took with her things and putting the photo box on his dresser. I asked about her, I listened to their stories whenever he felt like sharing that part of his life, I feel like I knew her. I would however have been bothered if he wore or carried 'her' around with us everywhere we went. I don't feel like that would have been part of a healthy relationship. She was and always would be part of his life, no physical thing with him at all times was needed to hold a memory and I would have also found it hurtful (not that I agree with your gf's approach to expressing this feeling). He ended up passing away, young as well. I have a box with memories and took the photos down after a year, on my own, to help with the healing process. Everyone grieves differently and in their own time, but if you are ready to have new relationships then I think it is fair to ask for things like this to be placed aside in memorial. ",
            "I was one of the people who thought that M was simply uncomfortable with the idea of the ashes.\n\nI am so glad that I was right, and that it worked out for you.\n\nI think you might owe it to M to definitely make her a priority now (that's what you were going to do anyway).\n\nThe deceased will always be remembered, but the living must go on living.",
            "Her actions show a lot about her character - that she is willing to admit when she is wrong, and she can own her mistakes. I would consider this incident a blip in your relationship, and I hope you have a long and happy relationship together.\n\nIf she ever starts being controlling again, address the situation immediately.",

We *do* appreciate stories when communication results in revised mindsets and cooperation. I'm so glad that this story was the latter!

Awesome. I think this will ultimately being you two closer. ",

She was coming off as an irrational person...and I am so glad that I was wrong.\n\nThe fact that she put that much thought and effort into empathizing with your point of view speaks volumes as to the kind of woman she actually is.\n\nShe reacted poorly, realized she reacted poorly, and made amends for it.

It sounds like she really learned from her mistakes and the picture was a really sweet gesture. It sounds like you had an amazing first marriage and I'm happy that you are getting to share it in a very \"normal\" ;) way with someone who sounds like a great person.",

            "I'm glad to hear she changed her mind, did some research and is going to therapy. That is a nice ending to everything. I know I was one of the ones to tell you to end it, but I'm glad it seems to have worked out.   \n  \nBest of luck. ",

I doubt that someone with such an intense reaction to other forms of laying someone to rest would be able to handle the ring and chain as she did. Before, she gave the impression of intense disgust. She basically called you a freak because of it and I'm worried she switched the stone with another.

It wasn't so much everyone wanting you to end things in some sort of bloodthirsty FINISH HER! kind of thing more so than \"if her position is that ring can't be around\" then she's making the wrong choice and you don't owe her any compromise on that particular issue.

You wouldn't be the you who you are with M if it weren't for your wife! I am glad things are working out for you. :)",
            "Wonderful resolution. That being said, I think it sets an unhealthy precedent to call your failure to tell her the third ring was your wife's ashes \"lying.\" It would be a weird thing to come at her with out of left field and you don't seem like you would have lied or danced around the truth if she asked.",

Everyone was so quick to assume that she was revealing herself as a controlling bitch, or a crazy person, or that she wanted to erase all evidence of your wife's existence.\n\nTruth is, sometimes we have gut reactions to things. She thought the ring was disturbing. She reflected on that and realized that her initial reaction was wrong. She shouldn't have acted the way she did, but she very clearly wants to make it up to you. I'm extremely glad that you're giving her the chance to do so, rather than listening to a bunch of judgmental assholes.",
            "I think what's important to remember is reddit tends to jump the gun a little on cutting people we feel seem toxic. This is because we've watched two many people not change and continue to hurt our OPs, while the toxic person they described did not change. This is why updates are so important. The person the op's describe in the beginning generally are waving giant red flags. We have never met these people, we have no idea of their capacity to change or come around open minded. Sure the op's will *say* how out of character blah is, how perfect their relationship is outside of said problem etc but half the people who post here have been so conditioned by either family, SO or outside influences that they can't really see how imperfect or dangerous their relationship is.\n\n\nI guess what I'm getting at is I think I can speak for us all when I say we're happy for you.

Quite early on she already opened up that she has quite severe anxiety, but had medication and counseling to control it. Since coming here it's been really stressful for her with finding a job, a place to live, all the paperwork etc, but on top of that some of her medication is not freely available here, which she has run out of now. Once she has her medical insurance all set up, she'll be able to get other medication and go to a counselor.\n\nThis week she had a couple of drinks and got drunk. She called me after and we talked about some normal things, but after a little while she began opening up a bit more about her past. She said there have been periods where she's been depressed and at times had suicidal thoughts. I didn't really know what to say, so I said that I'm real glad she didn't because otherwise I wouldn't have met this wonderful woman. She talked about missing her friends etc and I tried to comfort her a little bit.\n\nI'm not sure how to handle this situation. She apologised for saying those things over the phone, which makes me think to just forget about it. But on the other side, I really want her to know that I care a lot about her, that I want to be there for her, that she can talk with me about these things and that it won't scare me away. Let her know that I'm in it for the long haul.\n\nTL;DR: girlfriend opened up about past depression and I need advice how to deal with it.",

            "Imo: You should let her know that you are thankful that she talked to you about her problems. It must have always been in the back of her mind. Tell her that she is a strong person and that you'll always be there if she needs someone to talk. She might feel bad atm because she deconstructed the image you had about her, at least in part.",
            "I agree with people's advice about thanking her. Opening about this stuff shows a person really trusts someone and thinks highly of them so while it's a lot for you to handle, it's a weird compliment as well.\n\nThat said don't be afraid to set boundaries around discussing stuff like this. My GF and I both have eating disorders (pre-dating meeting each other) and we both firmly refuse to engage in 'baiting' type talk with each other like when the other says 'do you think i'm gaining weight?' or 'did you read about this diet?'. \n\nWe will ask the other why they are feeling like they are needing that coping strategy right now but refuse to engage in the behaviour. We always try to do it with love as in 'I will not harm you by helping you self harm' rather than  shame like 'oh my god, why would you do that?'\n\nWe also found that often it was easier to open up when you weren't face to face so phone calls, texts, walking side by side or lying in bed in the dark made it easier to say vulnerable things such as disclosing feelings or setting boundaries. \n\nAnd for really really tricky stuff as we got to know each other better and read moods and cues we used certain animal memes and photos as a proxy. It's a bit like when kids ask if teddy can have their tummy rubbed when they feel worried about asking for their needs to be met directly but surprisingly adaptive to adults. My GF and I store up our chosen animal photos and memes and send them if we don't have words for stuff yet so the picture of the snake in a jumper says it for you and then becomes a shorthand so you can ask later 'are you a snake in a sweater kind of day?'\n\nI find everyone with anxiety responds well to boundaries and a lack of uncertainty so instead of her thinking 'oh shit what if he hates me now because it's 7 hours since I talked to him about this' you can text and say 'hey, just grabbing breakfast and doing the laundry so probably going to be off text for a bit but if you'd like to talk about stuff from last night, want to chat after dinner?'\n\nThat kind of response stops her spiralling which then makes he unable to talk it through later and sets your boundary that you need time to process it. It doesn't enable but creates the best possible way to come back to stuff for both of you. I always find it super helpful when people don't leave me hanging or return my vulnerability with sincerity.\n\nHope that helps. Also if it's appropriate offer to help her with the practicalities of finding meds and therapy in your country. It's hard doing that with anxiety anyway but even without anxiety having a native who just knows how the medical system or whatever in new place works really helps. \n\nOften a lot of living in a new country is translating the culture more than the language per se. I live in the UK and have played guide for many American friends who are baffled by the NHS or why British people queue so much even though we all speak the same verbal language. It really helps having someone show you instead of get knocked back or stuck.",
            "She doesn't want to be an emotional burden. Just let her know you are there for her.",
            "Here's the most important thing I have ever learned about being a boyfriend/husband.   \n\nYou do not have to fix everything.\n\nSometimes, you just need to listen and understand and support.   In this case, the knowledge of what she has told you needs to be held in confidence and paid attention to in the future.",
            "Hi OP! I\u2019m basically in the same boat, but roles reversed! I started dating someone 2 months ago, and I\u2019ve drunkenly told him things that I regretted the next day. I\u2019ve apologized a dozen times over, but he reassured me that I can\u2019t scare him away with my mental illnesses. Heck, we can relate on some levels, since we share ADHD. I still feel really guilty, but I absolutely feel like I can trust him even more.\n\nWell, I\u2019m in the throes of a depressive episode, and I\u2019m currently in hospital. I fully, entirely, definitely expected my boyfriend to get freaked out and break things off or at least back away. That\u2019s a helluva way to kick off a relationship. But he blew me out of the water by telling me he\u2019s thankful I\u2019m getting help, he still loves me, he wants to sneak his cats into my room, he misses me, AND he visited and gave me a foot massage. I recently got privileges to leave the unit, and he said he\u2019ll take me on a date. When I said, \u201cI can\u2019t leave the hospital...\u201d he replied, \u201cThen it will be a hospital date!\u201d\n\nYou have no idea how much all of this means to me. Just like your girlfriend, I\u2019ve let myself be vulnerable around him, and he responded with kindness that melted my heart. Vulnerability is very scary, and taking the time to say, \u201cI know opening up is hard, I feel honoured that you let me in, and I will always listen\u201d can make a world of difference.\n\nIn my opinion, let her know how you feel so she doesn\u2019t agonize over it and try to push that vulnerability away from you. If there are parts of what she told you that make you concerned - talk about that, too. There is nothing quite as relieving as knowing that someone you care about WANTS to know about and support you through your illness, not just tolerate it as a side effect.",
            "Hi OP!\n In my experience as someone diagnosed with Generalized Ansiety Disorder and Clinical Depression, talking about how you feel can be even fisicaly hurtful because, on my moments of insecurity, you don't want to be a burden on those who are important to you. \n In your case, you are a important new person on her new fase, see how worthy you are? I would be terrified to lose you or scare you away because how problematic I am but also I would hate myself if I don't tell you about it. That's a brand new and delicate moment of her life, I clearly can see that she's problably stressed and insecure with all this changes at the same time while she tries to stablish her new treatment on this new location.\n All you can do for her is to be patient and compreensive, talk to her about feelings always (not only hers) because you'll open as safe place of conversation for both of you to be honest without gilty and shame.\nGood luck!",
            "It's good that she opened up to you. \nEven if you can't relate, just let her know that you care and you're there for her. \n\nYou should definitely talk to her about it, it will have been building up for a long time. \nI only moved about 125 miles across North england and I miss my old town (sort of), family, mates. I'm acutely aware of how old my mum is getting and how little time we have. I'm not a sociable person and so I ended up feeling a bit isolated and alone generally for the first couple of years, and you are missing the support of old friends and family.",
            "She\u2019s apologizing because she\u2019s probably feeling insecure about telling you that sensitive information because she isn\u2019t sure if you see her differently/ treat her differently. I think it would be good if you told her that you are thankful for her telling you that sensitive information and that if she ever would like to discuss it with you you\u2019re here for her.

            "As men we often feel that it's our job to fix things, but this isn't something you can fix. Only time can heal this wound, if at all.\n\nShe wants someone who will listen and not judge her. You don't have to understand why she feels the way she does, either. Some things in life are inexplicable, and our emotions are often the definition of that word.",
            "Just be there for her, man. You can\u2019t fix her, and she may never completely heal. Depression sucks, but it sucks worse feeling alone with it. As long as she\u2019s seeking shelter in the warmth of your embrace, be that for her. If either of you are religious, do what\u2019s appropriate there as well. Just don\u2019t think she\u2019s too broken to be worth your time.",

            "You can always tell her she is not obligated to talk about it, but you are there to talk about it regardless- this implies you care about her but doesn\u2019t make her feel like she needs to talk about it all right away, nobody wants to feel interrogated about sensitive matters.",
            "For those that do not suffer from depression the idea of ending it all may seem foreign, but to those that do suffer from it, it's just part of life. Imagine that you constantly are being tormented and having all your flaws and imperfections shoved in your face by the person you hate most, for people with severe depression it's a constant, and that person is themselves. Depression is something we all feel, that elephant that sits on your chest at times, but for people with disorders that cause them to get stuck in that state it can feel like the whole world would be better off without them. \n\nIf she's opening up about this to you and you care about her talk her through it. If she's out of her medication I would recommend getting her in to talk with a doctor about options, the often have samples on hand that may be able to get her through until she is covered under insurance. Help her out without making it your sole purpose, be there for her to talk to if she needs it and spread a little extra love on her, she's away from home and we're heading into the holidays which can be hard on anyone, but especially someone with a depression disorder. \n\nTo ignore a problem is to put off a solution. We all should do a little better about talking to people and making sure they are ok. Having gone through that doesn't make her weak, but the fact she's still here doing things most people wouldn't even consider should be a huge testimont to how strong she is, so what if she needs some help, ya?",

            "Speaking from my own experience with depression it's literally like having a demon bnb in your ear every day that basically puts u down. It's not really feeling sorry for yourself. You will get these thoughts like u are worthless stop trying to talk to people you know nobody really cares and you have to fight bbn it. As long as she has someone to talk to she will be fine I've dealt with it most of my life and it's just like everybody else we have a dark and a light side but depression tends to take on a mind of it's own.",

And now she is probably worried that she made the wrong decision to tell you, that she is burdening you with something that isn\u2019t your problem, etc. \n\nThat lets her know that she was right to say something and you\u2019re there for her.",
            "Do talk to her about it. It takes courage for people with anxiety and depression to open up and trust in people. Definitely thank her for sharing, and be there for her whenever she needs you to. Sometimes, all she need is someone to listen.",
            "Sounds like you found a human. \n\nA pretty good one at that as she's working on finding her own normal and not coping negatively. \n\nRelationships are worth investing in.\nVery few will ever be out-of-the-box *perfect. \n\n I have encountered women who have had very little hardship in their lives. And I have met women who have had the kinds of challenges where you find yourself truly amazed and inspired by their refusal to give into the pain and persevere. \nShe opened up. That, by itself, is difficult for many who suffer with depression as depression comes with a social  stigma. It already makes the sufferer feel different and seperate. So it often goes untreated for that reason. \n\nIf she opened up, and alcohol was needed, then she guards her secret. See it for the gift it was. Don't fear being strong for someone you love. \n\nIt's part of what loving someone is all about.",

He always felt like he needed to fix things for me, and that caused frustration for him because he felt like nothing he said helped. He started being less stressed about it when he understood that I just needed support sometimes.\n\nJust listening can help. Providing support and love can help. So saying what you wrote here about wanting to be there and such will probably mean a lot to her. Also letting her know that there's nothing to apologise about.\n\nShe may not be aware that alcohol is a depressant. It doesn'tmean that she should never drink, but just being aware that she could feel mentally worse afterwards. Personally, I don't drink unless I'm in a good spot mentally, and sometimes, it still brings me down or makes me anxious.\n\nEdit: I should define support. Support is listening, holding a hand, giving a hug, validating that something is stressful or difficult. Support also needs to be spread out with a counselor, friends, and SO. So moving to a foreign country would really mess up her support system.",
            "OP, it's a big step to admitting such socially \"unfavorable thoughts\"  depression and suicidal tendencies can weight heavy on the person suffering AND their surrounding.

When she has a bout of depression, the best thing you can do is be supportive, understanding, and show her you care about her.\n\nAlso, this is not her fault either, although she will likely claim it is during an episode, even if logically she knows better. The best thing you can do is be supportive,understanding and show her you care about her. \n\nWith all of that said, the responsibility to get help is on her, but she seems to be doing that. She is probably worried that after finding out this information your opinion or feelings about her have changed. She opened up a huge vulnerability to you. And she is asking a lot of you to be involved with someone who is depressive and has anxiety disorder. You don't have to stay with someone who is with those issues if you don't want to. But ignoring this will not help anything, acknowledging it will let her know you care and let y'all each make the best decision for yourselves moving forward.

If she says; well I thought xy and I felt xy during this time because of xy. Your answer would be; so because of xy you felt xy and had xy thoughts in your head? Her answer would be: \"Yes exactly\" or something that confirms your understanding.\n\nAlso, ask her to go more in depth about certain things when the time is right. Let's say she mentions the feeling of a particular day in her past, ask her to elaborate on what happened during that day, then again; seek to understand. \n\nOnce you have the basis of why she feels the way she does and she sees that you understand her, you can make her understand that you're always ready to listen, and understand. And if she asks for advice, be honest and tell her that you're not an expert before maybe giving her some of your thoughts/advice on the matter. That alone, simply listening and understanding can already be extremely helpful. It's called empathetic listening. Where you literally only listen, and answer to see if you have understood what she said. Not just nods and mhm i see's or \"aha I see\" etc. But I don't hold you for that type of person anyways.\n\n I have a friend that when I tell her some deep stuff, she listens, but she doesn't try to understand, barely asks questions, barely says anything at all. It's 100% eye contact and nodding. But that doesn't give me confirmation that she understands my problems. And the advice to social anxiety I got was \"to get out more often\". I didn't ask for advice, I simply wanted her to understand, but she didn't try to do so. And that in turn left me hurt. It makes me not want to open up again because now I'll be afraid she's just gonna sit and nod like a puppet and disregard my problems with a mainstream piece of advice that I didn't need. \n\nSo, try to understand her. Don't be like my friend when it comes to these things. But I've already mentioned that I think you're not the type of person to nodd and go mhm all the time.",

She was taking advantage in the last two years.\n\nI posted about a 4 year relationship causing me mental, emotional, and physical health problems due to said partner failing to find a job or contribute to the finances in any meaningful way. I made the post at the height of the COVID in my area, trying to keep the relationship alive. At the time, we had moved to a new state and a smaller town to live more cheaply, and to help address my physical needs that couldn't be met in the city with everything and everyone locked down. \n\nThings were good for a few months. However, the job question came back again. I was working full time, and had taken on new responsibilities for keeping myself in shape, working hard to lose the weight. That's when I noticed she was just kind of... existing. She wasn't excited about anything in the area, and wasn't doing much to find jobs. I had a talk with her in October, and we agreed that perhaps my request that she find a salaried 9-6 job could be relaxed, and part time would be sufficient to help out. After all, I only needed two things from her: space from time to time, and her to help out in any way she could with the finances. \n\nThe first of two final straws occurred that winter: I was working to build a new business from scratch, and I had to leave my job in order to do it, which meant around ~4 months of negative income. It was going to be tight, but she agreed to help support by finding an easy job. This support never came. She couldn't do it, or didn't want to. I began to notice it felt more like the latter. As a result, we barely made rent in February, thanks to my taking on contract work on the side (effectively working two jobs). \n\nWe had a huge fight in February over this. I wasn't willing to be that close to being homeless just because she didn't want to work a job that was beneath her qualifications. I made it explicit that this was a deal breaker for me, and that I would not move an inch in the relationship until she started contributing in the way we discussed. She agreed. \n\nAnother 5 months went by with no job. At this point, frustrated with her lack of success, she asks me to move with her to her hometown and move in with her parents while she looks for a job where she had a network. I flat out refused and we went on break. I moved to a new state and hoped that maybe some space would allow me to think clearly about the relationship.\n\nBy September this year, I realized I felt completely happy to be on my own, and stress free. We broke it off completely. To my knowledge, she still doesn't have a job as of this post. \n\nI feel used, emotional, physically, and financially abused, and hurt by how casually someone could run me into the ground like this. But I also feel hopeful about myself, and I'm seeing a therapist who's helping me unpack it all. Further, my business was worth it, and it's taken off and given me enough time and space to deal with all of this while maintaining a healthy lifestyle. \n\nOverall, the biggest downer is I feel like i've just wasted 5 years of my life with someone who I'm fairly sure was a subtle abuser the whole time. It hurts to say it, but the way I always felt like the bad guy, or the way she would guilt trip me and keep me from my friends... bad news. I'll never let anyone do this to me again.",

Three of them in fact (1st 5.5 years, 2nd 5 years and 3rd 7 years) in total 17.5 years of being with people that did not appreciate me. I had two amazing children with the last relationship, but that ex partner has been financially and emotionally abuse post break up, so that relationship really is not over until my kids are adults.\n\nAs queer people we receive so much negativity that it is hard to not internalize it.

She said her dad was in the military and she understood moving around a lot.  She told me to stay after school today and she took me to Target.  Before we left she gave me a tape measure and told me how to measure myself for a bra so I did that in the bathroom (turns out I'm a 32D).  \n\nShe bought me bras, curly hair shampoo/conditioner, and a book on puberty and stuff.  She asked if I wanted feminine clothes too but I said no thank you, she was already so generous.\n\nMy dad saw the stuff and he got really mad at me.  I told him my teacher bought it and he said I shouldn't be blabbing to strangers and accepting their money.

That way you can organize your thoughts and allow him to read them on his own. \n\nIt sucks that he's acting this way, but I'm so happy for you that you have such a nice math teacher to help you out. \n",

As nice as your teacher is, your dad still could use a wakeup call about this. You're going to need more shampoo and bras eventually, and he's got to learn these are real needs for you.",

            "You're young but, in a situation like this its best you grow up a little faster and stop depending on your dad so much, psychologically and financially.  You have learned that when you need something, go to someone else, you can't depend on him.  He doesn't want you \"blabbing\" because he knows he's wrong and he's scared and embarassed and can't handle being a single dad.  He's upset so you should just leave him alone for a while and let him process what is going on.  If you argue with him he'll just be stubborn and go on a power trip.  Do what is best for you, let him yell, let him be upset, he'll get over it and eventually realize you are right.\n\n\nIt's true that you have to be careful who you express vulnerability to, and who you accept gifts from, lots of people out there will manipulate and exploit a vulnerable young teenager.  At your age though, think of it like this: If you ask an older person for a favor, and they expect something in return that in any way makes you uncomfortable, then run the other way.\n\n\nAt this stage, its okay to tell your dad little white lies, because he does not want to face reality.",

This is going to, probably already has, impact your life in a negative way. Your dad isn't thinking like a rational caring parent. Mentioning boys, berating you for actually talking to someone, all raise red flags in my mind. I don't want to distresss you, and I don't want to make things worse, but maybe you should try talking to your teacher again. Explain everything that's going on and maybe also see your counciller.

As a parent, it is his JOB to put aside his personal issues when you need basic care.  Someone who's grossed out by poop doesn't get to opt out of changing his kid's diapers.  Someone who's grossed out by feet doesn't get to not take their kid to buy shoes.  Whatever his problem is with you, bras and boys, the correct reaction is for him to get the hell over it and get you what you need.  You know what?  Even if you WERE interested in boys, that's normal for your age!  For your dad to just shut it down and use his anger to get you to stop talking about it isn't right.  That's emotional blackmail.  \n\nWith that said, your dad has the power here, and I have a feeling that pushing it might cause him to dig in harder.  So I would let this issue lie and quietly keep wearing your bra, and hopefully as the \"new normal\" sets in he will get over it.  Keep reaching out to trusted teachers/authority figures.  If you have a doctor's appointment coming up, make sure to keep it and bring up some of this stuff.  They might be able to talk to your dad.  \n\nAs for the school nurse -- I trust you that she's intimidating, and if you truly can't talk to her don't force yourself.  But you might try testing the waters with her a little bit.  If she's nice underneath, that intimidating-ness could make her a great advocate.  But again, trust your instincts.",

Your father may do other things as you continue growing up, and based on an experience I had with a student your same exact age whose mother had simular fears, this may turn into a rough ride.

            "Your teacher is amazing! \n\nAs for your dad, he probably doesn't know how to deal with your feminine issues and needs. He probably doesn't even realize you need those things, so maybe you should ask for some allowance so you can handle that on your own. And the yelling, he must feel like someone else just pities you. He probably doesn't want someone to feel bad for his kid, and you should maybe try to tell him why you needed female help on this issue. ",

Are you artistic? Athletic? Do you read a lot? There might be some free art/sport/book clubs for teenagers in your area. \n\nP.S. Your story is really touching. You sound like a great young girl. Just remember to keep taking care of yourself, even if your father cannot understand that bras, pads etc are things you really need. Keep asking. There are also places that give out stuff like pads and tampons for free. I bet there might even be places that give out free training bras/sport bras. Keep your head up and remember you DESERVE a good bra.",
            "I was always really small chested in high school and my mom never bothered to take me to get a bra and I never brought it up, then once i wore a lacey shirt and noticed I could see my nipples through it kind of and got really embarrassed.  \n\nI don't see why a bra has anything to do with boys.  Honestly hiding nipple contours is the main reason I wear a bra at all.  Unless I'm wearing something lose or a hoodie I wear one not even for support.  It feels less modest to go without.  \n\nYou need a governess, girl.  ;) keep talking to the math teacher and make sure she knows how grateful you are.  Tell her more about the situation as time goes on.  She'll be able to recognise problems you might not see.  She might be willing to meet with your dad.  You're going to need more than a few bras over the years, he'll have to buy them for you eventually.  ",

She educated you on sexuality, which is something a school requires parental consent in most US districts.\n\nIn short, your teacher did the right thing, but risked her job to do it.  Try to keep it from getting back to administration.",

I was one of the ones who suggested having the more serious talk with him, and I have a daughter of my own.\n\nMy suggestion is that you try to find ways to make a little bit of money, whether it be babysitting, lawn mowing/snow shoveling, or whatever you can do.  Dad has indicated he's not gonna be helpful here so you're likely gonna have to make up for it.\n\nI'm really sorry, OP.

That, or hes just stubborn in his ways. Either these things are practically a necessity for any woman. You should set up another day with your math teacher to go shopping. It would form a great bond between you and her. Either that or have someone personally speak to your father. You should have got whatever you needed when you asked him. And to neglect your needs like that and brush it off like it's nothing isn't cool. But I hope your dad has a change heart, best of luck to you OP.",

He's probably afraid of losing you since he lost his wife/your mom and hasn't bothered to date or live a life.outside of being your father.\n\nI think you need to go to a school counselor and discuss your situation and the possibility of the counselor helping to facilitate a discussion.between your dad and you and stepping in to mediate where needed.\nIt might also be pertinent to ask your dad if he would read the book on puberty you were given. Just tell your dad that you understand it's awkward and no on likes it, but that you want him to know and understand what you are going through so he can be there for you if/when you need him to be. \n\n",

He'll calm down eventually, just keep being a good kid in all the ways you are normally a good kid.\n\nWhen people get really upset like that, there's usually some personal emotional reason rather than the situation itself. He might be embarrassed and worried that your math teacher is going to think he doesn't take care of you or isn't financially stable enough to take care of you. \n\nAs regards the \"accepting money from strangers\" thing -- maybe next time he would be less upset if you've \"paid back\" your teacher by helping her out in some way (tidying the classroom, correcting homework for her).

            "I get the feeling that since your father lost your mother to a cancer that primarily attacks women he kind of wants to deny that he has a daughter ( with ensuing female 'problems' ) and could lose you the same way. The fact that you're turning into a woman is frightening him?",
            "In Australia we have a thing called the Kids Help Line for anyone up to the age of 25 to call for help and advice on anything. My suggestion is that you find whatever equivalent there is in your country and call them for advice. The people who run these hotlines can provide plenty of information for you and tell you about places you can go to for support. Your dad doesn't understand your needs and this will be a constant issue until he is educated about it. You need to get advice on how to get through this. The stuff your teacher bought you won't last long so you will need to find a way to get replacements. Finding a support group or mentor will make everything feel so much easier. \n\nIf your dad really does care about you, he will get over it once he understands that as a female you need certain things like bras and that you are going to need advice from a female perspective as you grow into an adult woman. But until then, I strongly suggest looking for support groups or mentors.\n",

But just because he was a single parent didn't mean he gave up on his responsibility to me to help me grow up with what I need. He got a female family friend to take me bra shopping, and I had sisters to help me with the period stuff.\nOP, your dad may still be grieving about your mom, but that does not give him the right to refuse getting you things you need to survive. I cringe at the thought of you stuffing toilet paper in your underwear for 3 years. \nIt may be hard to do, but you just need to straight up tell him that bras are not sexual clothing items, but serve a function (especially since you're so well endowed, a bra could really help take the strain off your back). You need to be able to advocate for your needs, OP, and as difficult as it may be to stand up to your dad, you're going to have to, since he's not advocating for you.\nI wish you the best of luck, and if there's anything I can do to help, PM me.

It's a defense mechanism to justify his own lack of action on these matters.  He is clearly in the wrong and he's making excuses for his own behavior under the guise of some principled position.  It's nonsense so that he can tell himself he's doing the right thing.  Be confident in your own need to get a solution or answer to any of the problems you have.  Don't hide out with your problems \"in the back row\" of life.*\n\nYou're going to have to get help from other individuals to fill the void of your lost mom.  Love your dad for what he is, but you're going to have to find other individuals to lean on.\n\nDon't be ashamed or put yourself in a position where you are suffering because you have certain needs or questions.  Don't be embarrassed.  There are no stupid questions in life when you are 14 years old.

Then, I noticed something special of his that his mom had given to me, that I didn't feel comfortable just throwing away. I broke no contact to ask if he wanted it back, and let him know that his key was in the mail.\n\nHe responded and said I could get rid of it. Knowing that he was looking at his phone, I ventured even further across the no contact line to let him know that this was so hard for me, since he had played an equal part in how close we were, and driven the relationship just as much as I had. Then he put up an emotional wall and ditched me without a real reason.\n\nHis response?\n\n\"I'm sorry for shutting you out. I used you for companionship until I didn't need it any more. I don't have any more answers for you.\"\n\nIt's a strange hurt. It gave me what I need to never look back and fully know that I would never ever go back to someone who is so emotionally out of touch with themselves. Someone who could do that to someone. But it also is making me question people. We were good partners, and took care of each other. We never bickered and enjoyed our time together, and he just pulled the rug out from under me and revealed an incredibly selfish person. Who was I even dating?\n\nAs much as I want to tell him how selfish he is, I think he knows. When I responded, I told him \"You broke my heart in the process, and this is going to be a hard wound to heal. I do appreciate the honesty.\" And I think I will leave it at that, because I will never regret taking the high road. I shared so much with this person, and suddenly that person doesn't exist. At least I can intentionally move forward now.\n\nTl;dr: Ex boyfriend who dumped me after seemingly wonderful relationship told me that he used me for companionship until he didn't feel like he needed it any more.\n\nUpdate 1: I want to be clear that I wasn\u2019t looking for any specific answer, or to rekindle things. I was looking for ANY reason that would make this easier to process and move on. Thanks so much for all the comments so far. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nUpdate 2: I in no way feel that I was manipulated. The original post was written 30 minutes after being dumped; the 2nd after 2 weeks of reflection. He is a good guy, and a decent human being. His parents have a really fucked up marriage and that has to affect his view. Either way, he clearly told me with his actions that he didn't want to be with me. My brain was stuck on his words. We talked about futures. He called me legs after ONE DATE because he felt like it was \"going somewhere\". He told me how excited he was about me, and how he had never connected so efforltessly with another person before. I don't think it was all my delusions. There was fault and hurt on both sides; nobody is a bad guy here. Everyone needs to sit down.",

They sort of just \"shut off\" and then move on to the next person, fulfill their needs, break it off before they get emotionally attached because they're not sure what they want/think they can do better/don't want to get tied down/whatever the reason, and then continue the cycle. Sucks but it is what it is.\n\nYou can do so much better and you're worthy of a guy that's going to value your relationship as a long term commitment. Allow yourself a small window of time to grieve (you had feelings of love for this person and even if he didn't share those with you, your feelings are still valid so of course it's going to hurt) but don't let it consume you.\n\nThe next step after that is continuing the search. Be upfront about wanting something substantial. Also take this time to work on your communication skills. I remember having troubles being able to talk about what was bothering me in past relationships, which led me to writing a lot of letters/emails/long texts. I've found that it's better to be able to articulate what you want. Work on talking. Based on your previous post, it sounds like you guys prob didn't communicate well-enough (so what if he was an introvert, introverts can still talk about their feelings - so many people use that as an excuse to bottle up rather than talking through problems). Be mindful of that in the future.\n\nThat all being said, good luck! You're still young so you've got plenty of time to find a man that's worth your time.",

We had a happy 6 months together, had conversations about what we wanted from a relationship-  marriage, kids, house. It felt like the real deal. The butterflies in my stomach made the love feel so intense and real. It was more intense than anything I'd felt before.\n\nThen everything seemed to make a 180 degree turn. He never wanted to spend time with me, shut me out, wanted to be alone all the time, felt negative when around me for too long. He made up excuses about being busy. He travelled a lot for work too, for weeks at a time and that suited him perfectly. \n\nObvs I turned to Google for an explanation. I had no idea what to search for so I searched everything it could have been. Until I found some sort of an answer. Attachment. Your ex sounds like a classic Avoidant type. Fears intimacy, using distancing tactics, generally doesn't want to be close to another person for fear of loss of their independence. Sometimes the avoidant type doesn't really understand why they behave the way they do... He's not the villain.. and again it sucks to be in your position.. from a psychological view his behaviour is kinda explainable. It's no excuse for it defo because he really hurt you. Knowing there's some sort of explanation really helped me get thru it. It didn't lessen the pain, I guess only time can do that, but it helped me create my own closure. I hope it helps you too",

He thought about it, was honest with himself and decided that he was happier single than with you. That's just the truth of it. We can gather from the post that they had differing views on this but that's what breakups usually are. Even if you initiate it, the end of a relationship can be difficult.  He's dealing with his own emotions and you've made it clear that you'd like to get back together while he's trying to move on. It was a bit harsh but he just doesn't want to give you false hope. Everyone is processing their own feelings and needs to turn elsewhere for help. \n\nBeen on both sides of this and it sucks. It'll be difficult but hopefully you have friends and family to turn to.

Break ups can seem so much easier to swallow when there is an answer to the \u201cwhy\u201d\u2013like he met someone new, or you did something specifically wrong, and so on. The hardest breakup to accept is the one you\u2019re going through right now. Nobody did anything wrong, it just fizzled out. As harsh as your exes statements may be, it just sounds like he realized he wasn\u2019t ready for a serious commitment. he may have also realized, as you admit yourself that him being kind at first and his response gave you the implicit go ahead to push on talking to him about your relationship, that he needed to be harsh in order to shut down the postmortem.\n\nYou are not going to get what you were looking for or hoping for in continuing to text him. Given how long your relationship was, there is a very good chance that you will find something else of his or related to him that will make you feel like you have to reach out.

            "OP, about a month and a half ago I experienced something very similar with my partner of 2 years. We had already bought our anniversary gifts, he was planning a birthday gift for me just two nights before, we were still going on dates but I could tell something was up so I confronted him and a week later he pulled the plug.\n\nHe told me that our conversation made him feel sure in his decision and even though there was nothing I did to drive him away, he just felt unhappy with himself and wanted to go travel at length and do things that would apply great stress to our relationship. Of course I tried to barter at the time but now I realize that he is just far more selfish than I had thought. We had a great relationship where we talked about marriage, buying homes, having children, and we didn\u2019t really fight on top of what I thought was a healthy dose of communication.\n\nThe other commenters are right, he could have just made some changes to himself to adjust but many people are not cut from that cloth so where it would have been easy for us to adjust, it\u2019s not like that for others. But you deserve someone who always has both feet in the door.\n\n\nI feel sad for my ex, that he is in such a bad place with himself that he threw away a perfectly good relationship with a supportive partner but it doesn\u2019t make it sting less for me. I really felt like my world had been shattered and I still feel that way, it\u2019s just not as scary now. I miss him dearly but he has caused me a great deal of pain and suffering.\n\nMy best advice is to just keep busy, focus on healing properly and letting yourself feel things. No contact is the best way even when it\u2019s difficult because you\u2019ll feel so much worse after you speak with him. Things do get better but I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s a long road ahead.

All the guilt and residual feelings I had for him just fell away because I realized he'd never actually loved me and there was absolutely nothing to regret except that I'd wasted so much time in a relationship that was never equal and could never have succeeded in any real way. After we got off the phone that night I never spoke to him again. \n\nIt's so freeing to know there is nothing left to look back on fondly, no reason to feel guilty or ashamed, and that you did nothing wrong.

I tried reaching out a few times but discovered that I had to answer my own questions about what happened.

If they answer yes, follow up is \"what does emotional availability look like to you?\"  \n\n\nSo many people say they are dating because they want a long term relationship, or that they want to fall in love. But, then they don't account for the fact that their own emotional development doesn't include the capacity for real intimacy\u2013\u2013 that they are only capable of the gestures of what a relationship looks like on a surface level.

            "When I was in my freshman year of college, my then boyfriend broke up with me. We had been together since 10th grade. It was the most serious relationship I\u2019d ever had at that point. I was certain we would move in together after college, get married, spend our life together. \n\nBut we both went off to college. I moved 5 hours away and he stayed home and commuted. We were around different people, in different areas and really learning who we were as people. \n\nI tried to grow myself around the relationship. No matter who I became, I was his girlfriend first. Which, thinking back, is a horrible mindset.\n\nHe broke up with me because we grew apart and he fell out of love. And it. Sucked. I was depressed for a while.\n\nI let myself cry for a couple of days. Confused in friends and just let myself be sad. But the more time passed the easier it got. I still thought about him sometimes, but I didn\u2019t cry about it anymore. \n\nFive months later I met the man I would end up marrying. When I least expected it to happen.\n\nI know it sucks right now and you probably feel like someone punched you in the gut.\nBe strong. You\u2019ll get through this.

When you give it your all and it's not enough, you gotta see that he's not who you thought he was. Strangers are easier to move past.

They\u2019ve already proven themselves to be not the person you thought they were just by the fact that they\u2019ve blindsided you - I\u2019m so glad you adjusted your expectations of that human accordingly, because it took me months of being consistently disappointed by a person I thought I knew to get there.\n\nThe other thing I want you to make sure you recognize with yourself is the unique challenge of your relationship that you thought was just fine blowing up in your face. Right after my ex dumped me, someone said \u201che didn\u2019t even give you the luxury of your relationship falling apart,\u201d which has always stuck with me as a very apt assessment of these situations. There\u2019s a special place in hell for people that absolutely broadside their significant others with a surprise breakup and it\u2019s a specific sort of trauma that you unpack in therapy (if you\u2019re not already there I recommend it) and affects you differently than a relationship that mutually disintegrates, for lack of a better word. \n\nAnyway, I wish you well. This kind of stuff is not easy and I hope you find some peace soon.",

I\u2019m a turbo introvert, and never really dated anyone ever (27m). I\u2019ve had my flings here and there, but there was one girl I also met on bumble who was great. Smart, kind, sweet, and all things good. We hit it off immediately and started seeing each other a 1 or 2 times a week\u2014no longer than a total of 2ish months if I had to guess. Then one day, she was lying on my chest after sex and said \u201cI feel so safe with you.\u201d It instantly came crashing down around me and I realized I was just using this girl for the companionship, for the emotional connection, for the physical touch, to feel important to just one person, and to make me feel like I was normal. I really did like *being with her,* and I never did anything other than give her all the respect and attention I could trying to be what I thought a good person in a relationship could be.\n\nI realized immediately that I\u2019d been lying to myself the whole time about why I was pursuing her in the first place, and I was in turn lying to her as the byproduct. It wasn\u2019t malicious or anything, and I broke things off in a similar way by essentially sending her a message containing all of my thoughts and apologies. Ultimately, I felt bad, because she was someone who had everything going for her (goes to Harvard, parents have incredible home at country club, she was working on a patent and company for her career in GIS), and I felt like I was going to pull her away from that no matter what by pulling the rug, so I did it as early as I could think to do it as not to pull out too much with me. For pulling the rug, I\u2019m embarrassed and sorry, and it\u2019s because I was too weak and inexperienced at the time to do good for myself and for a partner. \n\n9 months is a long time, and I don\u2019t think I can excuse a lot of his behavior in the same way as I might be able to within 1.5 months.

She didn't, was blindsided, and wasn't given the opportunity to speak her truth.\n\nHis response wasn't some \"utilitarian\" bid to crush OP's longhoping for him. Nor did he snap in frustration by her continuously harassing him for an explanation. He was simply being an unempathetic, cruel, douchebag. Being, \"honest\", doesn't invalidate how disgustingly cruel his response was. If he were empathetic if any way, shape, or form, he would have been tactful. A simple, \"I'm no longer interested and don't have anything to say\" would have sent message. Informing her that he viewed her as a playtoy to meet his own needs?

I'm sure he had thought about the relationship he had with you for a long time and had distilled his feeling down to the most truthful and blunt response.  While that REALLY sucks for you to be told like that at least it was honest (like you had said). \n\nPeople will do some interesting stuff when they get desperate and lonely sometimes.  Go on dates with people who they know they arnt compatible with just to have a person to go on a date with.  They will often treat the date like they were intrested in the person just for the sense of normalcy.  \n\nI feel like he may have been doing that with you but got to the point where he had to be honest with himself and eventual you too. That the relationship was him just going through the motions and he really didn't feel the way for you that he was portraying.  I'm sure he didnt know a better way of handling the breakup other then how he handled it...like a bandaid he ripped it off quickly and painfully.  \n\nWhile it may not have been easy for you (I've been there is sucks), no way of ending the relationship in an honest way would have been. A long drawn out discussion would have been just as heartbreaking.  While it sucks that it didnt work out at least you didnt get any deaper into a loveless relationship and end up in the dead bedrooms subreddit \n\nGood luck and when you do finally meet \"the one\" you'll look back and start to see the signs and holes in the relationship you couldn't see before.",

I do think that a lot of people do it without actually knowing that is what they are doing. \n\nIt's actually quite remarkable of him to know that's what he did and to acknowledge it directly to OP. \n\nMost people don't get that much of a real answer when they are broken up with so harshly.\n\nIf he knew he was doing it, then that's an insanely shitty thing to do, but my guess is that he realized that's what he was doing and then broke it off after he thought about it for a few weeks.\n\nMy best guess is that he really enjoyed the relationship if OP is accurately depicting it. Then, at some point about a month ago, he stopped enjoying it because the emotional hole that he was using OP for was fulfilled. \n\nIt was at this point that he had a realization about the relationship. So, while him and OP connected well and everything was going really well, he then realized that the relationship had runs it's course for him. He wasn't interested in a long term relationship with OP and he didn't know what to do. \n\nThen, he had to mull it over for a few weeks to find out if this was a temporary thing or if it really was true that he was done with the relationship. Turns out, he really did only want it to be a short term and pleasant relationship, but he isn't sure what he wants going forward. \n\nAt that point, OP emailed him and then he had to make a decision. Break up and move on, or put up an act in the hopes that his feelings would come back. \n\nFor most people, this is the best way to end a relationship, with as much honesty as possible. Much worse is for the person to put on an act or cheat or ghost or whatever. \n\nMost people aren't socio-paths that use people intentionally for emotional support, most people do it but don't know they are doing it until much later on. Most people just know that they feel a lot better when they are with that person, so they keep on seeing that person. \n\nIt's never easy to go through a break-up, so I hope OP feels better soon.",

It probably means you're still in the honeymoon phase and not comfortable getting messy and emotional with each other (or at least he probably wasn't).

            "Humans are strange. Quite often we don\u2019t really know why we do things. We make up stories to ourself by default to make sense to ourselves. Shown for an example by Michael Gazzaniga research on split-brain patients. From an early age we learn that we better have an explanation for our behaviors.

Not a rational way of reasoning, but I done it and have had friends who have done it. \nMaybe he\u2019s depressed?",
            "TBH, the \"easiest\" answer is \"I did something unforgivable, you don't want this\" and even that (I've had it happen to me) isn't easy to walk away from.\n\nYou had **long term** plans with this guy.  That isn't an easy thing to detach yourself from.   \n\n\nAt 9 months, my guess is the \"honeymoon\" effect was in play or starting to phase out.   Basically you are so wrapped up in the \"new\" of a relationship, your brain tells other signals to stuff it early on.   It just sits there and says BLISS BLISS BLISS!.   Over some time (like 6 to 9 months) the same things no longer trigger that BLISS BLISS BLISS thinking.   That means the irratiating thought of \"but he chews with his mouth open, gross\" is allowed to rattle around your head when it was previously denied.\n\nIt could have been something like that for him.   Or he could have let the relationship go faster than he was ready for and then essentially \"woke up\" and was like \"how did I get to here?\".\n\n\nThe best way to think about this is that he had \"reasons\".  He had enough \"reasons\" to have an uncomfortable converation with you about breaking up.   But in truth, he also didn't care to share those \"reasons\" with you explicitly (which is fair).   Asking him why, which I understand for you feels like a great way to try and process this, is likely coming across to him as \"tell me what I have to argue against to get back together\".   He's saying he doesn't want that.\n\nDon't let this hurt your faith in people.   In the end, he chose to be mature and end this directly rather than what loads of other people get \"well I'll just betray their trust and let stuff sort itself out... plus more fun for me\".   Cheating is horrible because not only do you feel betrayed, but you are often \"discarded\".  You literally get to see the person you were cast away for as well, which stinks.   \n\n\nI'd suggest reframe your perspective here.   Yeah it stinks this guy didn't work out.  He was legit and just came forward with that and ended things in a mature way.   But you also should fill your life with people who appreciate you - so making any \"just as friends\" plans is kindof silly - he doesn't want that.  \n\n\nGive yourself some time to grief the loss of this guy... and the future plans you wanted.   Eventually you'll feel better and be ready to try something else.   There is no magic period of time.  There is no good way to accelerate this, it just happens when you are ready.\n\n\nI will add, if you try to jump back in (but still have scars about this) you're going to potentially generate a negative/toxic relationship.   I say that from experience as well.   \n\n\nToxic relationships are like the honeymoon thing, but instead of BLISS BLISS BLISS coming into your brain you get AT LEAST IT'S NOT AS CRAPPY AS MY LAST ONE!   which as silly as it sounds, that is what happens.  You are thrilled to not be experiencing the same type of hurt/pain/whatever... but just because someone isn't exactly aweful as the last doesn't make them immune from being a jerk in other ways.\n\n\nSo... instead of getting jaded about people in general, look at how you let the honeymoon effect play into things for you here.  What would you do differently?   Is there any feedback you could have solicited from him to change this?  Was it unavoidable?   Adapt!",
            "I don't know you, and I don't know this person, but this sounds like a lie to me. Specifically, him saying \"I used you for companionship until I didn't need it anymore\" sounds like a lie. There could be a lot of reasons for this. Maybe he's really hating himself right now and is searching for ways to cast himself as a villain to justify this hatred. Maybe he's casting himself as a villain to make it easier for you to move on from him, which in turn will make it easier for him to move on from you. Maybe he's lying to himself, and he thinks that's what happened because he's not willing to confront or admit to himself what was actually going on. Maybe he has no idea what's going on in his own head and just picked the first cogent explanation that occurred to him. In any case, I wouldn't be 100% sure that the person you dated for that period of time was a fiction. To me, it seems just as plausible that the person who put up those walls and sent that text was a fiction. In any case, you did the right thing, and my heart goes out to you for the pain this has caused and will cause you as you go through the healing process. Remember to take care of yourself.",
            "I had a eerily similar breakup a few months ago. He became very distant and then broke up with me, I thought our relationship was perfect. He was so cold during the breakup, it hurt, but I think it made me realize he wasn't the person I thought he was. Our exes are broken people that don't deserve our love and companionship.

            "Listen, I started to come out my version of your big hurt, after maybe six months, when I realized that if I didn't want to spend my life with someone, then I would break up with her. And then I realized, how could you spend the rest of your life with someone who really didn't want to be you.\n\nHe doesn't have to give you reasons. The fact that he's decided he doesn't want to spend his life with you is all you need. You would do the same. Some people who break up see the clarity fast, in others, it slowly simmers, but once they reach the decision, it is valid. They don't have to explain.",

            "This is a tough one. If I'm being honest, I've done this myself inadvertently, and I'm guessing he didn't set out to hurt you.\n\nSometimes, when one partner is in the process of getting to know a potential long-term partner, they're doing all the right things, going through the motions, but still exploring the relationship. They're not deliberately leading someone on, they're just looking for their own answer and that's received as an investment into the foundation of something long-term. Often times, it turns out that it actually is the foundation of something long term, and I'd argue that that's one of the right ways to start a long term relationship.\n\nI think in these situations the problem arises when they find the answer is actually a no. Maybe it's that the problem was they needed more perspective, maybe they thought they genuinely needed long-term companionship but that idea died out as the possibility grew real.\n\nI guess the point I'm making is that there are alternatives to him being a sociopath, and the honesty is a good indicator that he was just as surprised as you were.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this :(",

Messages to previous exes and screen shots of their conversations to embarrass me. More than anything, I have never been verbally attacked with such vicious, vengeful language (\u201cI will burn you to the ground\u201d etc.).\n\nAnyway, the point is, good for you.

            "Thank you for sharing this. I am going through something similar. Got broken up over text after a six year relationship. Guess I saw it coming as soon as I decided to move to a different country for a better future. He said he\u2019d follow but my gut knew he wouldn\u2019t and that will be the end of it. It happened several months back but I still have a hard time moving on sometimes. I employed to no contact rule but he keeps reaching out and giving me mixed messages - like he wants me in his back pocket till he finds someone new to move on with. I on the other hand am so much better off without talking to him but I have a hard time setting strict boundaries because at the end of the day I am still not ready to accept that it\u2019s the end of our story. Although I have to say I\u2019ve come a long way in the last nine months and can tell you that time is the best healer. For anyone reading this, hang in there, yes you\u2019ve probably heard it a million times but that\u2019s the best advice in this situation.

            "You know, I wouldn't jump to assuming this is an \"incredibly selfish person\", because once you reflect on the situation did you really do your own due-diligence to protect yourself and make sure you were on the same page from the get-go. Ask yourself, did you really ask questions to assess what HE wanted, what the two of you were after a time, where things were going? Did he lie to you and mislead you directly by telling you what you wanted to hear? Were you direct about what you wanted? OR did you just passively hope that you were on the same page without confirmation? \n\nLook, you need to treat yourself and your time as valuable, your heart as something you want to protect. If you go out in the world of dating apps, there are a LOT of people who will be more than willing to waste your time, be your part-time lover, hang out from their own loneliness. They aren't bad people, but you'll feel horrible and heartbroken if you aren't making yourself a priority. That looks like telling a man what you want and are looking for, even if you're scared to scare someone off. You'll scare away the one's that aren't right for you, who will be MOST of the people you meet. \n\nIt also looks like checking in and not just settling into routine. Making sure you are actually growing as a couple rather than disconnectedly-coexisting. This heartbreak could be something you could have prevented. \n\nAnd yes, there are outliers to every scenario, there are liars, but learn to ask the right questions and trust yourself to cross those bridges when you come to them, and in the meantime be more pointed about and clear about what you want for yourself and a relationship.",

            "It hurts a lot to go through a break up. The pain you feel is a part of who you are and how you process separation from a loved one. This feeling is something you own and is yours alone - it is a powerful thing. In my view it has nothing to do with the person or relationship you morn, let me explain why. After one hard breakup I realized that when I've gone through breakups I recognized this breakup pain from an earlier time, from my childhood.. i had the same emotions when my parents would leave me with a babysitter. I felt torn apart and all alone. This is my pain to feel when I am being separated from someone I love, regardless of the ex... this knowledge that my feelings were separate from the person I was dating and not because of them gave me power back over my feelings. The ex didnt matter. I did. \n\nAlso,  this pain will help you empathize and help others in the future. \n\nTo help you feel better please know that it is always better to be single and loving yourself than in a relationship with someone who doesn't love you the same way.  You deserve better. Being happy and single is so much fun one you are ready to enjoy it again. And when you are happy and single then you can be ready for the right person for you. Don't morn a relationship that was with Mr. Wrong.  Focus on living your best life.  You are great and you deserve it!!",
            "I was in a relationship that was so important to me. I truly thought we both loved and adored each other equally. In the end I found out he lied to me so often and about so many aspects of his life, I felt like I never actually knew him. That is the most painful part to work through, that you were tricked and used. \nTake comfort in the fact that your love was true and you gave it your all. Know that you being authentic and vulnerable does not make you a foolish. The person who lied and was dishonest is the person that has the issues, not you. Take time to grieve and be compassionate to yourself.  Best of luck my friend.",

            "I'm sorry. Something very similar happened to me 2 months ago. We were together for 9 months. We were planning on moving in together, talked about getting married one day. It was loving and effortless and not like anything I'd ever had before. Everything seemed perfect. Early October, we went on a picnic together. I'd prepared all of the food and supplies, drove us to the park. She was sitting on the blanket and I was setting out all of the food I'd prepared, when I got a text. Yup, she broke up with me via text while sitting right next to me.\n\nWe talked for a while, cried. She told me I was a perfect partner, but she couldn't handle being in a relationship anymore. I was devastated, but didn't argue or beg. I told her I loved her and I would never want to be in a situation where I made her unhappy, and if this was what she needed than I was okay being friends once I'd had some time to process. She said we could hang out again once the dust had settled.\n\nThe beginning was so hard. I couldn't eat for 3 days. I tried texting her 2 weeks after, just asking how she was. I knew that she'd been dealing with a lot of stress with work and school. She said she was fine, but she needed space. I gave it to her. Sent her a text a month after the breakup. Told her I had a couple of her things at my place that I'd like to return, and that she had a couple at hers. Asked if we could meet for coffee and light conversation (dipping our feet into the friendship pond) and to swap things. Told her I understood if it was too much for her right now and that I could just drop off her stuff with her roommate if she wanted.\n\nShe responded a few days later saying, \"Yeah, just drop my stuff off. Yours will be in a plastic bag by my door. I don't want to see you again. I know I'm being a coldhearted b\\*\\*\\*\\*, but I'm over it. I'm sorry you got mixed up in my bull\\*\\*\\*\\* by chance. Bye.\"\n\nThat was it. I picked up my things when I knew she would be at work, dropped off hers. She didn't even return most of my things. Just my full water bottle and a fork. Like she'd just dumped whatever I left the day she broke up with me into a grocery bag and left it on her doorstop for a month. She never texted me again, so I didn't either. The stuff I left was replaceable and I didn't want to return to her place or even risk a cruel response if I texted her about it.\n\nI may be a romantic, but I'm also a realist. Even as deeply in love and devoted as I was, I knew there was a chance we wouldn't work out. But I thought if things ended we would still always be friends. We were so close. She knew me better than anyone. We shared each other completely. Then she just cut me out completely. I felt betrayed. She was the first person I'd trusted with my heart and she'd ripped it out and stomped on it.\n\nIt's been a month since that text and you know what? I'm okay. I'm happy, optimistic about the future. I'll admit writing about her and what happened made my throat feel tight. But I can talk about her without crying. I can appreciate the time we shared. We made each other happy for a long time, and I learned a lot about myself. I can recognize that part of our relationship weren't great. She could be so good to me, but she wasn't always. Her playful ribbing wasn't always playful. She tended to take out her stress on me. She could be very self-centered and self-pitying.\n\nI can also see that I was so concerned with her happiness that I didn't consider my own often enough. Not only is that not fair to me, but I can see how that would put pressure on her to act like she was happy when she wasn't. I can recognize all of these things. I can acknowledge that the way she ended things was crappy without holding a grudge.\n\nTime really does make things easier. It's not about forgetting things, it's about regaining your prospective. Right now you're deep in your grief. The path to being okay again probably seems difficult and distance. But you will be able to get back to feeling like yourself. Let him go, and focus on yourself. I started spending more time with friends. Started a hobby I'd always wanted to try. Just keep going. Be gentle with yourself, but don't stop your momentum.",
