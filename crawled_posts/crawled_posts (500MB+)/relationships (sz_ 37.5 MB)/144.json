We are genuinely friends but he Actively tried to sleep with me before. Before we started seeing each other, I had concerns because he has Peter Pan syndrome and is inherently self motivated in the way he approaches women. He never wants to commit, I really don't want to date him. I just wanted a fuck buddy. We had a very long talk where I expressed my concerns and he said he would make a conscious effort if I gave him a chance. He told me has an issue with porn and that's where he learned about sex. I repeatedly mentioned that mutual pleasure and being present during sex is really important to me. I also told him that sexual compatibility is equally important  and we discussed what that meant in great detail. \n\n\nWe had sex. Well it felt more like he masturbated with my body more than anything. This man has no inherent understanding how to pleasure a woman.   He pulled my tits out of my bra the way you see in porn, never went near them except to titty fuck me. He never touched my clit, didn't really warm me up besides this very unpleasant fingering where he pried open my legs and essentially windshield wiped my vaginal walls to \"hear how wet\" I was while insisting on head. I repeatedly tried giving instructions. He pulled out of me twice to make me suck him off so he didn't have to nut in a condom. I spent more time with this man's dick in my mouth (30 min/45 min total) than he spent inside my body. Then after he came twice, he asked me how he would know if I came. Told him I don't really orgasm from penetration alone, so he pulled up his pants and said \"oh, but I finished.\" \n\nHe reached out today asking me to come over again but honestly I have no desire to do that again. How do I tell him that I don't want to sleep with him again? And if I do, do I share the concerns above? Will this end our friendship?\n\n\nEDIT; \nI don\u2019t want anything from him. Just to go back to the friends part. Like I want to revert the fuck buddy back to just buddy. I was horny and he was available and I genuinely like spending time with him as friends. He's the biggest commitment phobe and is undatable. Just sad he is also unfuckable. I wish I didn't break the platonic boundary. However as his friend I also think he needs to know that if he is going to be a forever bachelor he should at least know how to make those women orgasm. \n\n\nTLDR; Fuck buddying with a selfish man in bed and don\u2019t know how to tell him I don't want to anymore and ruin the friendship.",

I'm sorry the whole fuck buddy thing didn't work out, but I could never have done this with my male friend. He was like a brother to me, so just no, unfortunately he did repeatedly try & get with me, which got awkward. Thankfully those days have passed, we're happily married & my eldest is almost the age my friend was when we met, so we get to feel old thinking of that...which is not so fun....\n\n\nDo you have that one ex that was great in the sack, just not so much as a boyfriend? That's the safest & best option for a fuck buddy. Obviously, neither of you can have the slightest interest in being together again, but if your both single. It has the bonus of already knowing how to get each other off."

        "selftext": "I met my friend Chuck (29M) about 1.5 years ago. We were both part of an online local group for single parents, and eventually met offline with other group parents. I have known Britt (25F) since high school. \n\nChuck's wife died of childbirth complications the day their daughter was born, more than two years ago. Britt is a few months out of a 9-year relationship. Both of them have expressed wanting to meet other people, and I thought they'd be good for each other because of common interests and we all have kids of similar ages. \n\nTwo days before Christmas, Chuck and Britt went out on their first date. I kept Chuck's daughter at my house so the two could have some more time together without him having to worry about the baby.\n\nThe plan was for her to spend the night (she's done it before and gets along great with my 3 year old girl), but Chuck knocked on my door at 11pm to get his daughter. He barely said a word to me and I could tell he had been crying, but he wouldn't tell me what was wrong. \n\nThe next day, I asked Britt what happened. She said that they had dinner and a couple drinks, things were going excellent. She said she felt like they had great chemistry and were even getting physical at his house, but he suddenly told her to stop and to leave immediately. She swears that she has no idea what she did wrong and is really hurt by the whole thing. I believe her because she is really sweet and social, I've never seen her do anything to piss anyone off. \n\nI tried to talk to Chuck at the same time to get his side of the story and see what went wrong. All he said that he \"wasn't feeling it\" and didn't want to discuss it further. I didn't push it, but when I went to wish him a merry Christmas a day later, I saw he had deleted me from his social media. I texted it to him instead and asked \"you okay?\" but no response. \n\nI am seriously hurt and don't know what to do. Chuck has become one of my closest friends, and our daughters are the best of friends too. I am really worried that this has something to do with his wife, and I want to apologize if he felt like I was pressuring him to date after her death. At the same time, I don't want to overstep boundaries and bother him when he's having a hard time. It's been over a week and I'm worried/upset. \n\n**tldr: I set my two friends up on a date. Things were apparently going well until my guy friend suddenly called off the date. He has now deleted me from his social media and will not talk to me.**\n\n**EDIT: Someone mentioned that Chuck may be in love with me, but deleted the comment. I still want to address that. He's almost a full decade older than me, and has never expressed those feelings for me at all. In fact, the week before he cut me off, he said that I was a great friend and he was happy that his daughter had some female figures in her life.**\n\n**EDIT 2: Thanks for all of your advice, everyone. I think I will give it another week before I speak with him again. If he hasn't reached out by then, I will tell him that I am still here if he needs to talk but I will continue to give him space if he needs that, too. I am almost 100% sure that this happened because of his wife's death. Another one of my friends who is still on his Facebook saw that he had changed his cover photo several times since Christmas, and all of them were from his wedding.**\n\n",

            "Chuck is still grieving and overestimated how ready he was to date again.\n\nLet him work it out in his heart. He may just need some time to process the fresh wave of grief he just experienced. He may not have the words or the energy to talk about it yet, and is withdrawing so he doesn't have to, because of course he knows you're wondering what the fuck happened that night. He's probably embarrassed on top of everything else. \n\nJust give him space. You're a friend, not a caretaker. He'll come around when he's ready. ",

I'm honestly surprised at how much attention this got. ",
            "It sounds like he's not ready to be dating, and he's displacing that guilt on you as you were the one who set it up (with completely good intentions) and now he feels you're responsible for how he feels.\n\nMy suggestion would be to wait it out, it could take some time, weeks or months. If you continue to contact him often it will only make it worse and push him away. I would let it clear, a couple weeks, and maybe once more reach out with an apology again saying your friendship and each other's daughters' friendship means a lot to you. If he cold shoulders you again, you need to move on. Unfortunately, life is a set of friendships that pass as our lives continue where they need to head.",
            "Chuck has only been a widow for two years. This is probably his first date since her death. He probably feels guilty for being with someone new. ",
            "Oof. He's still grieving. Definitely. Losing someone you love is a deep wound that never fully heals. It's not your friend, it's not you, it's a him thing, please understand that. Please tell your friend this too.\n\n\nI _heavily_ suggest grief counseling to him, especially if the kid is a look a like of his late wife. Unpacking that baggage onto an already grieving child will really hurt that child in the long run if not properly addressed",
            "He has unresolved issues with his wife. Give him space for a while. Being out with your friend probably brought up lots of memories. Not his fault. All you can do is give it time and be there for him. Let him bring it up in his own time if he wants to discuss what happened.",
            "I am about 99% sure Chuck was struck by a sudden feeling of cheating on his wife, compounded by a massive revival of grief and missing her. \n\nYou probably need to talk to Britt first, because she's the 'easy' option: What she's hurt by is a totally normal feeling of rejection and offense at not being treated very well. She's likely to become significantly less upset by it all if she is able to see the events as purely being about Chuck being sideswiped and overwhelmed by emotions relating to his wife's death, and as having nothing to do with her other than that she had the terrible luck to have gone on a date with a guy who still loves his wife.\n\nChuck is probably dealing not only with guilt and grief, but also he's no doubt aware of having hurt Britt's feelings. On top of that, I would say there is a significant chance he's also really embarrassed about losing emotional control. Probably also some misc. anxiety about dating while being sole parent of a small child.\n\nAll in all, I don't think you did anything wrong by setting them up together, but it wasn't likely to go well because going back into dating after the death of a loved spouse hardly ever does (at least, at first). Which is not something you (or either of them) would be expected to know, unless you'd seen someone else go through the same thing. \n\nI don't recommend waiting another week for Chuck to reach out to you because that is potentially a week of Chuck spending a whole lot of time inside his own head thinking unhappy thoughts. Instead I suggest a text or email (something that does not demand an immediate response) telling him what you have planned to say as per your second edit. Then a week later go actually talk to him.\n\n",
            "Someone mentioned that Chuck may be in love with me, but deleted the comment.

And that neither you nor your friend will hold it against him.  \n\nHe *probably* is embarrassed, humiliated etc. But after the initial shock, he might not know how to open the door to you again after behaving badly. If you give him an opening, he might take it.  \n\nBut, he might not.  Be prepared that he might not be able to get over it. ",
            "I'm really sorry all of this happened and you lost a friend.  However, there isn't much you can do.  You've already reached out and he's made it pretty clear that he needs space.  Maybe text him again in a few weeks, but for now you should just respect his need for space.  I know it hurts because you want answers, but pushing him to talk before he's ready will only hurt the friendship more.",
            "Their date wasn't that long ago, I would give him some space and then try reaching out again in a few weeks. Hopefully he's processed some of the negative emotions and he's realized you were just trying to be a friend.",

            "He probably wasn't ready to date yet but tried to anyways. Just needs time and patience ",
            "Maybe your friend reminded him of his wife and he found that really hard. Losing your wife in childbirth is fucking terrible. It will take him a long time to get over it and not feel guilty about trying to move on. ",
            "It seems possible, that if he was as abrupt as your friend suggest. She probably did something that reminded him of his wife and it just set him off. He freaked out and has now kind of lashed out as a way of dealing with his grief. The deleting you could be a freak out and possibly becuase of some sort of anxiety he's feeling about it all. Give it time. Like others are saying give it a month and then text him, he'll likely come around.",
            "He wasn't ready to date but wanted to see if he could.  It didn't turn out so well and he is clearly embarrassed by it.  I don't see everything that he's done as something out of anger but out of severe embarrassment.  So unless it wasn't something else then I'm guessing he is just not ready.\n\nProbably feels he let... \n\n- you and your friend down by having it end up the way it did.\n\n- himself down by reacting the way he did.\n\n- his late wife down by going on the date in the first place.\n\nPersonally though, I think it's great that you would try to set him up with someone.  You had the best intentions it's just that he wasn't as ready as he thought he was.\n\nGive him a little bit of time or try communicating with text if you feel it's appropriate.  If anything just let him know that you're there could ease things a little.",
            "It sounds like it might have been a rush of emotions that just overwhelmed him. If things were as your friend says they were, things were going great until they weren't and now I would bet that he is super embarrassed by it, and that's why he isn't talking to you. \n\nJust my theory.",
            "Why are you hurt?  If he had an emotional episode and became overwhelmed that has nothing to do with you or anyone else.  It has only been two years.  That's not a long time honestly.  He maybe embarrassed about shutting it down and freaking out and that's why he's not wanting to talk to you.  Give it time and just wait him out but don't push him to talk to you.  That could have the opposite effect.",
            "Is it possible to write him a letter? Like you said, it really does sound like he wanted to give dating a try but found he couldn't bring himself to do it due to his wife. ",
            "\"He's almost a full decade older than me.\"\n\nI can tell you now, as a man, that being a decade older than a woman does not prevent you from being attracted to her, or even loving her, in any way shape or form. It might be less socially accepted than dating women your own age, but attraction is not logical and doesn't give any kind of crap about what's socially acceptable. ",
            "This seems a lot like a personal issue he is working through, and has nothing to do with you or your friend. While he doesn't seem to be handling it well, there isn't much you can do if he is so adamantly pushing you away. Try not to be overly offended and let him work through his grief. most likely he will be back around. ",
            "He may not be over his wife. It's still early to bother him. Let it pass and he may come back to tell you. ",
            "I definitely think Chuck feels some sort of guilt/betrayal over the date and those feelings expanded over to you but not because you set up the date or he has feelings for you.  I think maybe he started feeling guilty about your role in his life and his daughters.  He told you he's happy to have you as a positive female in his daughter's life which to me translates into you are a mom type figure for his daughter.  I think he's feeling guilty for wanting to replace his wife in her partner role with the date but also in her mom role with you.  It's not your fault and hopefully you can repair your friendship, it seems important to everyone involved. ",
            "He is feeling extra sensitive around the holidays. Perhaps the next time he is interested in meeting someone you can all be there to help take the pressure off. Hanging out, making dinner. Slow small steps. I imagine his daughter's birthday is also a very tough time for him. ",
            "This is so so sad. Make sure you talk to britt about chuck's remorse so she knows she didn't do anything wrong",
            "Sounds like a hot mess.\nHe's dealing with a lot of baggage. Feelings for the deceased, feelings of guilt of feeling good, feelings for OP and feelings for friend.   Sounds like he just can't cope with his feelings right now.  \nJust sayin'",
            "Just let him know you're there for him, if ever he wants to talk or needs a friend. Then let him come to you when he's ready.",
            "He's not ready to move on, you shouldn't be hurt.  Sometimes you don't find that out until you try.  ",
            "Im the one who mentionned he might be expecting romance with you, and I didn't deleted the comment, I got downtvoted into oblivion.\n\n\"\"EDIT: Someone mentioned that Chuck may be in love with me, but deleted the comment. I still want to address that. He's almost a full decade older than me, and has never expressed those feelings for me at all. In fact, the week before he cut me off, he said that I was a great friend and he was happy that his daughter had some female figures in her life.\"\"\n\nYou mean, like a new mum? A great friend just need a little intimacy and mutual attraction to become a SO: common interest, trust, respect are already there. READ THE SIGNS. Being a decade older never prevented men to be romantically interested in younger ladies... the fact you use it as a demonstration might indicate you don't want to see he may be into you while still mourning his wife. Thats perfectly legit but people feeling rejected might try stuff (like dating your friend) and/or cut relationship.\n\nI'd say the biggest problem with the sub is that its always one sided, and people sometime can be not fully aware of the other people signs and communication. Its still a theory. \n \n\n",
            "Maybe he felt like having her sleep over our him sleep over on the first date was too fast and it freaked him out.",
            "Maybe text him, tell him you love him and it's ok if it was too soon and you are there for him when he is ready to talk. It's probably embarrassment / profound sadness / overwhelming guilt all mixed together. Tell your girlfriend the same -- he must not have been ready, don't take it personally. I'm so sorry for all involved :(",
            "You didn't do anything wrong here, but he clearly needs some space as he is dealing with heavy stuff.  You're doing the right thing by giving him that space.  He'll get back in contact with you when he is ready.\n\nAlso, I know you've addressed this, but you should know that the 10-year age difference doesn't mean anything when it comes to having romantic feelings for someone.  My husband and I are 10 years apart, and I know many couples with that type of age difference or greater who have successful relationships.  I doubt that is playing into this situation for him right now; he may or may not have feelings for you, but right now it seems like he is dealing with grief first, then everything else second.  You may also want to consider the possibility in the future that if he finds someone he wants to date seriously, his friendship with you may not survive the new relationship (out of deference to his new girlfriend and whether or not she is comfortable with him being close friends with another woman).  It happens a lot.  It's certainly not fair, but it is a reality.",
            "Is it possible he is into you? ",
            "I don't know exactly what the deleted comment said, but from what I can figure out, it was about him being in love with you. That is the obvious answer to all this, I'd say. A decade older is nothing. He might not be good at expressing feelings, but saying he's happy his daughter has you in her life sounds to me like an expression of interest. \n\nImagine if you had a man in your life who was great with your kids and whom you often told how happy you are to have him. But you never really knew how I express your love for him. But things go well, and you think he should understand by now that you are in love with him. Then he says he has this great idea. You could date his friend!",
            "He realized you consider him a friend. He clearly expected more.",
            "He wants to bone you, and you sent your friend.  Now he realizes you see him as a grenade that someone else should lie on."

I found a provider, we had a look through profiles and chose one together, and then sent in our expression of interest within an hour of my asking. She responded two days later, and we had our first session booked in for the end of the week.\n\nKnowing he was hesitant, we gave the TV show \u2018Couples Therapy\u2019 a go, accidentally starting on season 2 which I think may have been a blessing in disguise as those couples made a lot of positive progress. This ended up being a really good idea! My partner was far more open to therapy when we started and really threw himself into it, and it actually helped me to start identify to some of my problems (looking at Michal\u2019s anxiety there, although minus the anger and aggression towards her partner).\n\nI\u2019m not going to go into detail with the stuff that came out, but even after just two sessions we understand each other so much better. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do to overcome things, but just understanding where our behaviours come from goes a really long way to wiping out the resentment, and helping us connect and communicate.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re both carrying childhood trauma, which I think I was less aware of on my side. Like I knew my family dynamic wasn\u2019t necessarily healthy growing up, and I have a complicated relationship with my parents as an adult, but I didn\u2019t realise how much baggage it had left me with. \n\nI feel more comfortable going into things from my side, so I guess I\u2019ll talk a bit about that. I never really had any safe attachments growing up, and I struggle a lot with feeling safe in relationships (both romantic and platonic), and with trust. I didn\u2019t even realise! I thought struggling with vulnerability and the way that manifests for me was completely rational and normal, but in retrospect of course it isn\u2019t. \n\nSo some commenters suggesting that maybe I was overreacting, or that maybe it wasn\u2019t just about the one situation, you were right! Just maybe not in the way you were expecting. It wasn\u2019t just about the financial advisor, it was about two adults with childhood trauma trying to be better people together who needed a bit of help.\n\nI know this is very vague on things from my partners side, but that is not really for me to share. I am however incredibly proud of him for opening up in the way that he has, and I\u2019ve learnt so much about him as a person that he\u2019s struggled to talk about before. Therapy has reaffirmed that he is the person I want to spend my life with, and has shown me that we\u2019re both willing to put in the work to make that happen.\n\nI\u2019m excited about where this journey will take us, and about the future we can build together. We\u2019re a great team and a great couple in a lot of ways, and the support we\u2019ve been able to give each other as we\u2019ve begun digging into our respective traumas has made me feel really positive about the relationship and where we\u2019re going, and that the things we\u2019re struggling with are things that we can overcome together (with a little help from our wonderful therapist of course).\n\nTl;dr We started couples therapy and it was the best idea I\u2019ve ever had. I will recommend therapy to everyone I meet for the rest of my life. I still have not learnt to not use long, run-on sentences.",

            "Great news that things are going well! I feel like we owe so much of the success of our marriage to pre-marital counseling.  My favorite part was the analysis of our childhood upbringing and trauma and how it plays into our behavior and decisions. My husband and I both were able to overcome most of those issues once they were identified. My other two favorite parts were the approach to money and how to have a respectful and productive fight/disagreement. All the best of luck to you two!",
            "I only found your update but I read your previous post and a loooot of comments and I'm glad you engaged so much there! You come across as very insightful, thoughtful and open and I'm so happy for you that your partner is matching that with the help of your therapist! It's a fantastic step and progress and I wish you the best of luck moving forward!",
            "The comment about understanding where a partner\u2019s behavior comes from helps reduce resentment is such a huge thing. Obviously, it\u2019s not an excuse for destructive or hurtful behavior, nor does it ensure compatibility, but it can make something that was developing into a dealbreaker into something that\u2019s acceptable in a long term partner.\n\nAlso, OP, individual counseling/talk therapy can improve your happiness and quality of life in general. You seem to have identified some things in the couple\u2019s counseling, and your husband too, that could use some attention outside of couple\u2019s therapy. My wife and I go as needed to individual counseling for our respective foibles.",
            "I've only had two loves in 50 years. They were very different people. Both died, one sudden awful surprise, the other slowly and we had chances to say goodbye and prepare. \n\nThey were quite different personality wise. You know what was defining in each of them was their quality as a partner. They were my best friend, they were great lovers. But the partnership with each was defining. How they'd tune in, even to the most difficult conversations, and give them their all. They had the courage to face right up to the hard stuff, so those issues passed quickly and we were in it together feeling made such a difference. I've had other lovers, I've had other best friends, I've only had two partners. \n\nI hope, I hope everyone, finds a great partner. If you're going to go through all that life can throw, a terrific partner along side hand in hand and heart to heart, makes all the difference in the world.",

I\u2019m so happy and proud of you two because putting the work is hard, but deciding to put in the work is a huuuugeee step that a lot of people are not brave enough to takes\n\nYou shared a few things of your partner and he reminds me so much of me. I started going to therapy, digging a lot into myself, and realized I have a fearful avoidant attachment. I would suggest taking a look at attachment theory, it really has been wonderful to learn more about myself.",
            "So...reading your other thread and some of the issues, are you sure he even wants kids? You said he would clam up when that part (among others) of the conversation came up. I saw that was one of your needs in the near future (a few years will go by lightning quick).",
            "A lot of what you wrote in your original post resonated with me, and it is for this reason that the reference to your childhood trauma in this update was not a massive surprise. When we struggle with vulnerability because we couldn\u2019t really rely on loving support, we can adopt controlling behaviours without realising. I am glad you two are doing so well with couples therapy; you are an inspiration already at your young age! Thanks for posting and all the best!",

He doesn\u2019t listen to you, and that shows a serious lack of respect and consideration. \n\nDo you *really* want to have to push, coax, cajole, beg, repeat, drag, push, pressure, coax, etc. him about everything? It\u2019s *exhausting* and will get much worse once you have kids. \n\nThe amount of emotional labor after having kids is way worse than what you are already having to do to get him to engage already. \n\nFind someone who actively wants to be with you!

I believed it was James as he did write a status on Facebook saying he had a new number. It was just casual talk \"how are things?\" \"How's your new boyfriend?\" I replied platonically and friendly as we did end on good terms. \n\nMy current boyfriend Max said if I am talking to my ex then he should be allowed to speak to his ex Brooke.\nI said that's fine, you can speak to who you want although you know I won't like that. I wasn't happy because the only reason I ever stopped him talking to Brooke is because their messages were always flirty and she still sent him nudes. So I asked him to block her, and he did. But He said he would talk to her anyway because I am speaking to James. \n\nThat was that.\n\nA few days later, Max went to make dinner, and I was up in the bedroom. I was looking for some socks from Max's drawer, and I found a cheap mobile phone that I never saw before. I looked on it and it was the texts I sent to James. I was livid. He was pretending to be my ex boyfriend?\n\nI confronted max straight away, and he admitted that he wanted to get back in touch with Brooke, and he thought if I spoke to my ex James, he could use that as an excuse to be able to talk to Brooke.\n\nI am pissed off. I am really angry that he had to do this behind my back. I asked to see his messages between Brooke and they are all flirty and just borderline inappropriate.\n\nTldr ; my boyfriend pretended to be my ex so he could speak to his ex. We live together, + own a dog. Is this salvageable? where do I go from here? \n",

            "You have separate problems here:\n\n* A partner who is willing to tell really huge lies (impersonating someone else is a huge lie) and who tests you covertly.\n* A partner who bean-counts (\"what I'm allowed and what you're allowed must be exactly equal regardless of context\")\n* A partner who has flirty conversations with others.\n\nDeliberate, premeditated, planned lies, is beyond the pail.\n\nBean counting isn't going to age well. The tendency is there in most people, but this one is pretty extreme. You don't want someone who demands absolute fairness (and uses any concession as leverage later) if you are making big decisions together, because those big decisions (eg. whose job gets priority when you move) can't be made absolutely fair.\n\nThe wanting attention from others is kind of gross, but you could choose to overlook it or live with it, or given him an outlet for it (some version of opening the relationship). Up to you what you think. However, the bean counting doesn't bode well for a negotiated solution.",

Uses whatever you share to get his way? And this was 'innocent' info, no deep dark traumatic stuff. He had to order a phone, he had to figure out how to set it up, he planned specifics about what to say to you and he was prepared to use the texts against you. That's a bit more steps than just a small mistake.\n\nApparently he wants his ex back. Go let him have her. You find someone better. No sunk costs fallacy. ",

He's incapable of seeing that you and your ex ended on good terms and are capable of a platonic relationship probably because that's how he is, incapable of a platonic relationship. He keeps an ex who doesn't respect your relationship around because he doesn't respect your relationship.\n\nRelationships are built on trust.

If you have any proof of vet appointments in your name or anything that strongly links you to the dog compared to him, you will be in a better position in keeping the dog.

            "Ok there are so many things wrong with this. I think that at this point, you know what to do. He pretended to be your ex so that he could turn around and use it so that he could talk to his? It sounds to me like he thinks flirting with his ex is more important than respecting your boundaries. IMO, you just need to end it. That's some manipulative BS.",
            "The thing he did is so crazy!!! Omg hahaha he sounds manipulative...but what do I know? lol I just want to let you know that normal relationships aren''t like this. So you can decide to stay in this relationship if you want, but just be warned, you are going to have way more unnecessary shit you'll have to deal with compared to the rest of us. So if you really want to take that workload up do you\n\n...i would not",
            "Yeah this is crazy. Is there a reason he didn't just text her from his phone to get the nudes then delete the evidence after saving the picture? Or why didn't he just text Brooke from the burner phone? This whole pretending to be your ex to \"even the score\" so he could text his is crazy. Plus, if the ex texted you first and you merely humored it, that's a lot different than seeking out his ex. Either way OP, you should dump him because he still wants his ex. Even if he agrees to go no contact with her it doesn't mean he doesn't still want her and you will be 2nd place. Sorry OP, but I'm sure you can find a guy who makes you his #1",

            "If he wants to talk to her so badly he's willing to break your trust, throw away his own integrity and take manipulative measures then let him be single. He's not relationship focused.

I said that's fine, you can speak to who you want although you know I won't like that. I wasn't happy because the only reason I ever stopped him talking to Brooke is because their messages were always flirty and she still sent him nudes.\n\nSo, clearly one of these things is not like the other. Having an ex text to chat is *completely* different than an ex who sends nudes. They are not comparable. At all. \n\n>he admitted that he wanted to get back in touch with Brooke\n\nGee, I wonder why. /s \n\nAll of this is highly unacceptable. Given his amount of deception and willingness to \"bean count\" as r/hawthornetree stated, this relationship has massive problems. If you don't want to break up, insist on couples counseling stat.

        "selftext": "Wow this is a doozy. Sorry the title is kind of a doozy, I'm feeling a little bit crazy and I need to be talked away from the hypothetical crazy ledge.\n\nMy boyfriend really likes Facebook. I have had no reason to not trust him 100% with it. He's definitely a like every photo/status kind of guy and just thinks that it is fun. I don't have a facebook, and my presence on his is nonexistent besides the mention of fun things we are doing here and there. I realize now that I could easily be mistaken for a friend/sister/cousin/etc. \n\nAbout 3 months ago, I got tipped off from a friend that he had been a little flirty with a girl on Facebook. I did a quick cyber stalk of her and she was gorgeous, and I noticed instead of the typical like he had been \"loving\" and \"wowing\" her pictures. I called him and told him I felt a little bit crazy, but I just wanted to make sure there wasn't any funny business. He assured me he is just being nice, and they've never met (she is a friend of a friend apparently?) and it is no different then me upvoting something on Reddit. They had messaged a few times but it was totally innocent and looks any flirtations were nonexistent. Ok, I dropped it, but my spidey senses told me to bookmark it, instead of completely discard the thought of her forever.\n\nA new movie is coming out tonight, and conveniently our favorite dive bar/dinner spot is RIGHT across from the movie theater. We just have to walk a few feet or so and there we are. We have both been stoked for his movie, and talking up our date night ALL week.\n\nI was going into a work meeting and texted him \"Hey I'll probably be tied up till after 5, so i'll see you at *name of place* at 7!\" \n\nHe texts me back (verbatim, to show how weird this was). \"Hey umm is there somewhere else?\" \n\nI don't know what it was, but after a few months of not even thinking of this mysterious facebook enigma, something shouted at me to look at her profile. Her profile is absolutely 100% open, there is no privacy. She geotagged how excited she was to see the movie and go to the bar. Hmm....Ok that is a little convenient. Did a little more digging, he's loved even more of her pictures.\n\nShortly after, he asks if we can just have a night in (which is weird, because my place is being remodeled and the only access at my house is the bathroom and bedroom, and he just had his fumigated and is staying at his moms). I'm like where da fuh are we staying in at?? I have already bought the movie tickets and I told him that I didn't want them to go to waste so to please come we can go eat at another nearby place.\n\nI just think this is all awfully convenient. Am I being a total loon in thinking he doesn't want his girlfriend and side piece running into each other at the movie/dinner?\n  \n\nUpdate!!!: first of all, you guys rock. It is nice to have an army of wonderful Internet friends. So long story short. After the movie I went to the bathroom and Facebook girl was also in there. I told her I loved her hair and then we were just girl chatting, and I was chatting with her out of the door where my boyfriend was waiting for me. He looked like he was going to faint. I was like \"babe! Meet my new friend!\" He was cheating on me with her. They had been having sex for a few months, and he said he was just in a casual relationship with me. Right a casual relationship with a house being built and joint finances???? Good hell. She told me since I have fake boobs I just wasn't enough for him and that was her justification for being ok with it, because I have fake boobs. It was weird like she knew who I was when we were chatting in the bathroom. So no damn girl power there. He didn't even seem sorry, which sucked because he really was my best friend. I don't make a lot of friends since I'm a trauma nurse and just don't get out much. I'm really sad, and feeling really stressed out and just broken. I also feel yucky, I'll get checked for STIS and all that jazz on monday. Time to fix this heartbreak. I took the weekend off of work. Ugh this sucks. Thanks guys you are all so wonderful and encouraging! \n\n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: SO avoiding our date because Facebook girl is going to same spots tonight. This is weird?",

            "If he can't give you a legitimate reason for staying in (actual sickness, family member died etc), yeah I'd be suspicious too. Sounds like he may not want her to know he has a girlfriend.\n\n",
            "Whaaaaaat? If he's been hyped for this movie, then that's definitely a 180 reversal for him to say he \"wants a night in.\" Especially considering what's going on with his and your places to stay. I don't think you're being crazy at all.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean he's cheating or has already cheated...maybe he just has feelings for her. Either way, something is definitely up. Call him out and tell him you want to know what's going on, IMO.",
            "Tell him you made a Facebook and sent him a relationship request. His reaction will tell you all you need to know.",
            "Ask him, straightforwardly, if it has anything to do with the fact that he was paying inappropriate amounts of attention to the girl who happens to be going there tonight too. \n\nI am surprised you offered to go to eat elsewhere. Why? \n\nAnd the lack of any presence on his public profile? Huge red flag. Huge. Especially because he is so active. I urge you to read any list of top red flags and being kept more or less a secret will be on each and every. ",
            "Trust your gut, stick to the original movie/restaurant plan, force the issue, tell him how you feel. Let us know how it goes.",
            "He doesn't want her to know he has a girlfriend. He's flirting (at least) and maybe has intentions of more..\n\nI don't trust it.",
            "He's a 30 year old guy \"wowing\" and \"loving\" another woman's pictures. This is something a single, 16 year old would do when infatuated with somebody else. \n\nHe's either cheating on you or thinking of cheating/leaving you. I don't think a 30 year old guy that stalks a woman on Facebook that isn't you is worth it.  Ask em bluntly what's up and if the answer isn't anything close to what you're thinking it should, call it quits. \n\nAlso, and maybe he doesn't help you with this, but regain confidence in yourself.  If my  wife would of been stalking and \"loving\" some other dudes photos all the time I would of called it quits. A couple here and there, but every single one?!?  Dude wouldn't have a chance with the other girl either if she was half smart to him and realized he tossed away a great girl like yourself for no reason. ",
            "Following and loving pictures of some random girl he's never met on facebook (yet could easily meet) is nothing like upvoting a post on reddit. I'm sorry, but he sounds full of shit. I'm crazy too so maybe don't listen but I'd drop her a line on fb and just ask her if she's interested in your guy.",
            "So what happened tonight?",
            "It's too obvious, and you've done some great detective work. He wants to appear available to his crush, so being seen out with you will most certainly make it known he's off the market, thus he cant have his cake and eat it too anymore. Alternatively, once she catches on to you and him out together, he might be worried that she could approach you two and mention some potentially relationship-ending things if you catch my drift. He's been emotionally cheating on you, and want's to continue the ego boost he recieves from his hot crush. ",
            "Girl get a legit Facebook and make him publicly in a relationship with you. Then see how he acts. This shit is shady as hell. ",
            "My ex found the woman he was was cheating on me with via a friend's FB friends.  He's playing you.  Open a FB account, tag him as being in a relationship with you, see what he does.  ",

            "He might not be cheating on you. He might just be flirting with her, enjoying the ego boost, and not wanting that to stop. But I would find the whole thing at the very least odd. To borrow a term, are you facebook official? Would this girl know you exist?",
            "You aren't crazy, thats sketchy as hell. Keep us updated and don't apologize to him, you aren't CRAZY. ",
            "Sounds to me like your suspicions are on point and he's into this girl, and doesn't want her to know that he has a girlfriend. His behavior makes that obvious, and you're not crazy for correctly reading those signs. No guy, especially one with a girlfriend, \"loves\" or \"wows\" the photos of a girl that is a friend of a friend and someone he has never met, unless he's interested in her. Hence, why he hasn't done it to anyone else's photos. \n\nI would give advice similar to that posted earlier by saying: \n\"We've been looking forward to this movie and our date night all week. We both love that dive bar and your place is being fumigated and mine remodeled, so it makes no sense for us to stay in, and that's not what you wanted to do until a few hours ago. I know that you've been really active on so and so girl's page, and find it very interesting that she is going to that bar and movie at the same time we were planning to and now you conveniently don't want to go. Something is going on that you're not telling me, and you need to be honest, right now. Come clean now, and we can work through it. Otherwise if I find out later that you've lied to me about it, things between us will be over.\"\n\nThen wait for his response. If he comes clean that he's been hanging out with this girl or anything you would deem as emotional or physical cheating, dump his cheating ass anyway and move on. I would also write to the girl on Facebook telling her that you're his girlfriend and ask her what's been going on. My guess is she doesn't know about you and she may provide some additional insight and information to help make your decision easier. You have every right to do that. It's not an invasion of his privacy at this point because you are attempting to save your relationship. ",
            "As someone that's was a cheater for much of their life, this is an obvious RED FLAG!! If he hasn't cheated yet, it really sounds like he's setting it up. If nothing else, you definitely have the right to confront him...remember, you have invested years of YOUR life in this relationship and, moreover, have already given him a second chance so u really do have the right to make certain. Stop being PC about offending his sensibilities...you already have enough reason to confront him. Go there...cuz u know it's bullshit that he wants you to go elsewhere else...it makes no sense. Go with your gut. You won't get LESS information or sense of what is happening if you do.  ",

Unless you're subscribed to a sub dedicated to one person's pictures of themselves (assuming those are what he's 'loving' and 'wowing') there is no correlation. Reddit's purpose is anonymity so even if you are upvoting numerous pictures of *one* person, the likelihood of you even meeting internet stranger is FAR LESS than meeting a \"friend of a friend.\"\n\nThis is some seriously flawed logic.\n\nI agree with the probability that he is avoiding bringing you to places where he might run into her. Put your foot down or get them moving towards the door, OP. ",
            "While he most likely hasn't pursued anything with this Facebook girl, he pretty clearly doesn't want her to know about you, his girlfriend.

I feel like you're smart enough to know what to do. Ask him, pester him if you have to, just make sure he gives you a VALID reason as to why he's avoiding these places. If you can, don't mention the Facebook girl at all. Let him bring her up. \n\nHonestly, this Facebook shit is so unoriginal. Can't people think of more exciting ways to be deceitful and sketchy?

            "Oh man, I'm so sorry this happened to you. What a dirt bag. \n\nHey, I'm a trauma nurse too. Rock on girl. We're badass. ",

            "Ask him again, what's going on with girl? Why are you avoiding being in the same places she is when you're with me?",

            "Looks super suspicious like he doesn't want the girl to see you with him and know he has a girlfriend. I would ask him to give you a good reason why he wants to stay in and see his response",
            "Op, I would honestly make a Facebook account for myself and add -IN A RELATIONSHIP with insert boyfriend's name-\nWon't it show up on his timeline as well? See how he responds. You can always delete the account once you see his reaction.  ",
            "Trust your gut. No matter what he says trust your gut. It's probably not far off the mark.\n\nBest of luck to you.",
            "Sending you so much love and positive vibes right now. Use this weekend off work to focus on yourself and slob out and cry and just take care of yourself. You're worth so much more than the way those 2 horrible individuals treated you, always remember that ",

            "I think maybe he has already taken her to that particular watering hole, albeit rather foolishly, and doesn't want to go there because he's afraid either someone will mention it, or 'she' might be there. I wouldn't mention her too much, but keep sleuthing, deeper!",
            "I sincerely doubt he's physically cheated unless you have evidence otherwise, but it's clear he wants to *continue to present himself* as single in front of this girl. You have every right to feel put off by his behavior and every right to call him on it. If he doesn't admit to anything, then know it's because he's lying to himself about this girl, and not because you're wrong.\n\nYou are right to feel upset about this. The only real solution is for him to tell her he's backing off because he has a girlfriend and is committed to her. Anything less than radio silence is grounds for breakup, and you know it. It's just hard to do.\n\nI hope today has found you with a better handle on this situation.",
            "Going with the benefit of the doubt here, he's avoiding her because he has a crush and he wants it to go away. \n\nIt's not unusual to develop crushes on other people whilst in a serious relationship. \n\nHowever.\n\nI would raise an eyebrow on this happening only 2.5 (or is it 4??) years in. You also mention in another comment that he hooked up with someone else. Whether he's cheating or intending to cheat, it sounds like it doesn't take much to turn his head. You should be worth a lot more to somebody than that. ",
            "I dabbled in a bit of scumbaggery years and years ago, when I was young, and this is exactly how a guy who is trapped would behave.  Send him a relationship status and see what he does with it, if you don't want to confront him directly.  Gather some data.  Actually seeing the conversation(s) he's been having with this girl would be the most direct route, and then talking to him about it, but I think this would be a good indicator.  Regardless, keep us updated please!!",
            "Something's defitely up. As other pp's have suggested, don't directly accuse him of anything, but don't minimise it either. Lay all the weirdness out on the line and say : \"This doesn't add up. What's going on?\"",
            "Maybe I'm naive but it is possible he has a bit of a crush on her (not one he would ever act out) and doesn't wanna sit in the same bar as her? ",
            "I'd say that he has some sort of attraction to her that he is dealing with badly.  Whether he's avoiding her or even, worst case, is trying to avoid her knowing that he has a girlfriend, this needs to be dealt with.\n\nFeeling attractions to other people is totally normal but I would say that you both need to sit down and address how you're going to deal with those emotions (distancing yourself, talking to your partner honestly).\n\nAnd perhaps you should make an empty Facebook and mark him as your boyfriend.  You don't need to update it or fill out your personal information, just a photo of the two of you and a relationship status.  Nip any future problems in the bud.\n",
            "I'm so sorry! But I'm glad you were able to find out.",
            "Girlfriend - I saved this post and just checked up on it today. Your edit is good, but the situation blows!\n\nI FEEL YOU. I had something similar happen (and I'm also a trauma nurse, BTW) where I found out via FB that my ex (\"Doofus\") was cheating on me. He even told his side piece that we were casually dating (after three years!) Not only that, when I confronted her, she said that because he and I weren't living together that (in her judgment - lmao) it couldn't be serious. \n\nYou have too much going on to be tied to that loser. You have a good, solid career, a house (that's being renovated - not a project losers take on) and - obviously - a strong morality that doesn't include cheating! You've got it *going on*. He... has side chick, and he *deserves* side chick because they share a moral code!\n\nOkay, now to my advice.... You think the hard part is happening now, and it is truly difficult to break up with someone you've been intertwined with for several years (and probably had hopes of being together for much longer), but just wait. I can almost guarantee you that when side chick gets boring (and she will) he's going to try to come crawling back to you. \"We had it so good. I looooooove you!\" The hard part will be not damaging your foot as you shove it up his ass when you kick him to the curb.\n\nMY mistake was taking Doofus back. He doubled down and begged me to move in with him, which I mistakenly did, because I needed to split the bills (I was just starting nursing school). We lasted just a year longer. We tried everything, but once someone disrespects you it's hard for you to get the trust back. That's another reason not to go back to him. He wants you the way you were, but that woman *doesn't exist* for him any more, he killed that part of you for him.\n\nPlease try to focus on work when you're there. I found it incredibly difficult to focus on anything but the drama and almost failed out of school. I wish you well. ",
            "I'd go, could be interesting.  At the very least you will know how things are as far as the FB friend goes.",
            "A part of me thinks you should've gone alone and bumped into her, asked her why she seems familiar, and then say something like \"oh you're that aspiring model that my bf really likes!\"  \n\nAnd then I think that it's a really bad idea, and that communication is key to a healthy relationship.",
            "Don't confront him. Join Facebook. Let him know you joined and how excited you are. Put up a profile picture of the two of you. Then add whatsherface as your *only* other friend. Next step: change your status to \"I know!\".  ",
            "So it's very possible he hasn't cheated with her, but he wants to maintain an illusion of availableness to this girl, so that if he gets the signs from her that she wants to advance their friendship to another level, there will be no hesitation on her part... Now yeah, that sounds pretty terrible, but I honestly think most people do this when the meet really attractive people, especially if that other person seems to reciprocate interest. If you met a Ryan Gosling type guy (or whatever hot actor guy you're into), and found you had an energetic, flirty friendship with him, you'd probably be seriously interested in him if he expressed interest in you... even if you were already in a relationship at the time you met him. And if you were interested, and hoped in the back of your mind he was too, you might not want to talk too much about your boyfriend when you were around him so that he wouldn't hesitate to express his feelings to you if he had them. Is it deceptive to the hot guy? Yes. Is it a betrayal to your boyfriend? Yes. But it's completely normal, understandable, and rational. Now I'm not saying you'd absolutely do that, OP, but a lot of people would, and if you boyfriend would do it too, I don't think you should take it too seriously. Most people want to be in relationships with the most attractive people they can find that they're compatible with. For some people shared experience and longevity is more important, but you two have only been dating for a couple years, and there's no reason to think you can't build a comparable amount of shared experience with other people. Yeah, the behavior is shitty but I would just enjoy the relationship you have with him now, and if it ends, it does, and if it doesn't, it doesn't. If it does seriously bother you, then confront him, but I'd say worrying about this sort of behavior is a wasted energy until more evidence of relationship breakdown comes forward.",

The only way you don't come off as crazy is if you have proof. If you don't have proof don't even mention it, people are good liers. ",
            "Maybe he was being honest, and he was just being nice online but now the girl is crazy and trying to meet him IRL.
