        "selftext": "I want to make this as quick as possible. My girlfriend, Annie, is MtF. She started transitioning early on in our relationship, but honestly, not that much changed. It was a year before she met my family due to timing, location, etc. They all loved her though. We eventually moved closer and she spends a lot of time with my family, especially my brother and his kids and me. \n\nAbout two weeks ago, hanging out at a backyard BBQ with my family, some of her friends, etc, the subject of kids comes up. Annie and I are not having kids, as we're not interested. But someone came up with the whole \"Oh you'll love them when their your own\" stuff and Annie just smiled and said, very politely, \"Oh, I can't have children. And I'm not interested.\"\n\nSo the nosy nelly pressed, asking why not, why doesn't she try IVF, etc. Annie just said, \"Well, I don't have the parts, for one.\"\n\nNosy Nelly, confused, asked what she meant.\n\nLet me preface this next part by saying that we never purposely kept that she was MtF away from the family. It just never came up, and it's not like it's their business. \n\nAnnie said, \"Oh, I was born with male genitalia and all that, that's all.\"\n\nNosy Nelly thought she was joking, but eventually caught on. Her entire demeanor changed. She got up and moved, she started whispering with other people. But no one had the audacity to say anything to us.\n\nTwo days later, a message on Facebook:\n\nNosy Nelly:\nHi. I'm sorry to inform you that I'm no longer comfortable with having Annie babysit the kids anymore. I'd also like it if you could please keep me informed if she is attending any mor BBQs or events. I don't feel she's a good influence to have around my children.\n\nI was shocked to get this and didn't know how to respond. As the day went on, a few more messages like that came in. I haven't told Annie yet, because I want a chance to fix this or do something before she finds out. \n\nAny suggestions?\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Family discovered my long term gf, now fiance, is MtF. Some of them are starting to say they don't want her around their children or at family get togethers. What do I do?",

            "\"Your loss.\" Block and unfriend. And go to any event she is invited to, without checking with nosy assholes.\n\nYou'll need to tell Annie very soon. Ask her if she would like to contact them or do anything. Otherwise, your family, your problem, you run the interference between them and her. Good luck. ",
            "[deleted]",
            "You can't fix this. Talk to Annie and make sure she knows you will stand by her, then respond to the messages as follows. \n\n\"Dear Nosy Nellie,\n\nI have no idea why you no longer feel comfortable with Annie being around the kids. We have babysat, interacted, genuinely loved and cared for my niblings. Has Annie said or done something to offend you? Because it seems like the only objection you have toward my fianc\u00e9e is the status of the genitalia with which she was born.  If that is the case I cannot remotely understand why the kids would be interested or affected by what's under Annie's skirt any more than what's under yours.\n\nI love Annie very much. She is the best woman I have ever met, her status at birth notwithstanding.  And you or anyone else who makes me choose between them and Annie won't like the outcome.  So no. I won't be informing you of whether Annie will be present at any family functions ahead of time as if she's a sex offender.  Any person who doesn't welcome my fianc\u00e9e can go ahead and strike me off the guest list as well. As for the kids, they are in no danger from Annie.  The only bad influences they have in their lives are from small, close-minded ignorant people like you.\"",
            "I'm not sure we have enough information to really say. How close are you with your family (i.e. how often are these gatherings)? How many people are at these gatherings and how many objected? Who hosts them? How close are you otherwise with Nosy Nelly?\n\nIn general, just be upfront with Nelly.\n\nFor example, my instinct is just to say \"I'm sorry if you are uncomfortable around my girlfriend. But I don't feel that it is reasonable for you to expect me to give you notice of when we will be attending family events.\" Then just see what happens. (I would let Annie know immediately though. She is probably used to prejudice and may have some advice and preferences on how to deal with the situation.) Best case she just gives you guys the cold shoulder for a while and then things just blow over after the shock wears off.\n\nHowever, you sort of imply that you had several other people make comments. If the host of the parties is likely to be a problem, or there is enough people objecting that it would be a hostile environment for Annie to participate, then you might have to draw a line in the sand about it. Make it clear that you find their comments bigoted and that if they want to exclude your girlfriend that they are excluding you as well. Again, consulting with Annie earlier rather than later is probably best here.\n",
            "I'd tell Annie about the messages and then ask \"How do you want me to handle this?\" Your SO might want you to cut ties or she might want you to try and work it out. She is the one being slighted so let he decide how to handle it, you just need to be willing to stand up for her and work with her on handling it. ",
            "Okay so I'm gonna recommend a slightly different suggestion from everyone else. Before I do let me say of course that what nosy Nellie did was totally unacceptable and you have every right to completely cut her out of your life. However, this might be an opportunity for promoting openness and understanding. I would give her one chance, and send an email explaining how much you love each other, how wonderful your fianc\u00e9 is, and how hurtful her comments were. \n\nSometimes a little unreciprocated understanding  and love is all it takes to help someone lose their hate. Sometimes not. If not, then yeah, tell her to fuck off and that you don't want any immoral degenerates like her around your new family. ",
            "This is my advice for dealing with bigots: be better than they are. Continue to act loving and kind, be patient, and assert for yourself without being confrontational. They may never catch on that they are the ones in the wrong, but you will know that your lashing out did nothing to exacerbate it.\n\nI think, rather than assuming you know why your gf's MTF status upsets them, you should just ask them. Say, \"I don't understand, in what way is she a bad influence on your kids?\"\n\nSee of you can get them to talk about it. Do they think its contagious? Send them some studies. Do they think is just unnatural? Send them some studies. Do they have a religious objection? Seek out some LGBT-Affirming religious resources / verses / blogs (I can help with that). Do they equate it with something they would consider deviant sexual behavior (like fetishized cross dressing)? Send them some medical information about gender dysphoria. Do they think someone who is GSM is more likely to be a sex offender? Send them some data. Or do they just feel betrayed and lied to? If so, maybe express some sympathy and explain that it was a private matter that you all had not planned on discussing with others. \n\nFind out what is the root of her prejudice (and that of the others in your family) with an open heart before addressing them. Escalating to confrontation will not improve the situation, but kind, patient responses armed with clinical data and delivered with love can prevent this from tearing a real rift between you all and your family.",
            "This is already a HUGE thread, so this will most likely get lost, but here goes:\n\nHere's an important component of your response to Nosy Nelly:\n\n>Annie is my girlfriend and you can expect her to be at any event I am attending. \n\nYou are not required to give that person any \"warning\" whatsoever, and most importantly, you make *them* be the bad guy and throw a fit if they're going to. Whose house do these BBQs happen at? As long as the host of the event is cool with Annie, Nelly can STFU. If it's at Nelly's house, I would decline any invitation until/unless Annie is welcome. \n\n**Where are your parents in this? Or even your brother?** Everyone's family is different, but I notice you specifically don't mention what relation Nosy Nelly is. Maybe your parents have passed, or are otherwise not in the picture, or just not nearby and at these gatherings. But it seems to me that if you can have them as social allies, that will help you navigate what may become an ugly family politics situation.\n\nYou said you never wanted to hide Annie's transition, and I think that's fair. But it's come up now, so you probably need to plan for conversations about it. And it may be a good idea to start some of those conversations yourself, as opposed to waiting for others to come to you. The people that do bring it up to you will probably do so to pick a fight. The people who are confused but not against you won't know what to say.\n\nI'm going to take a stab in the dark and guess that if you're marrying Annie, you have at least one other family member who will accept Annie now, without much question. Sit down with them, tell them something like:\n\n> We weren't trying to hide anything, but yes, Annie is transgendered. If you liked Annie as a person before you knew that fact, please remember that Annie is in fact that same person you came to like. And actually, her transition is part of how she became the awesome person I know and love.\n\nEssentially, you're going to need allies in this. And you're going to need to know who those people are, soon. The cat is out of the bag, and make no mistake, people *are* talking about. So you should talk about it too. People are going to have awkward questions, some people may take a while to come around, and realistically, some are simply going to write you off forever. Which as people have already said, good riddance.",
            "These family members sound like horrible, hateful people. Tell them they're no longer welcome at your family events.",
            "Damn. I love it when people find out and completely disregard all previous encounters and experiences with a trans-woman.\n\nI bet they also ask you if your gay now right?",
            "\"I'm sorry to hear that. What has changed?\"\n\nThen let them tell you and cut them out forever.",
            "Holy shit. Nosy Nelly's behavior isn't justified at all. Your girlfriend hasn't done anything to make NN question her I fluence over the kids she's babysitting. NN is a huge prude.\n\n\n\nThe right thing to do would be to reach out to NN, because it sounds like she's only acting this way because she doesn't understand your girlfriend or what she has went through. Offer to visit with NN to answer questions she might have, to get her to see that there isn't anything wrong with your girlfriend.\n\n\nThough you could go down the road of ignoring her, maybe sending her a message back explaining why you're going to ignore her. \"I don't want to be around someone who is willingly being ignorant to something that isn't your business anyway.\"",
            "\"You should safely assume that Annie will be attending any event I am invited to. So rather than have us notify you of our intent to attend, I recommend you speak to the host of any gathering to determine whether I have been invited, as we are not inclined to police ourselves in the fashion you suggest.\"",
            "'Those who matter don't mind, and those who mind don't matter.'\n\nThere is nothing for you to fix because neither you nor your fianc\u00e9e are at fault. Tell your SO what's happened, that you support her 100%, and ask her what course of action she would like you to take. The most important thing is that you don't waver in your support to your SO- this might require you to cut people from your life or disinvite them to the wedding. Be prepared to do that if it comes to it.",
            "I have a neighbor who is gay Alfred, and his friend Dursley (?! dont ask me I dont understand) is another neighbor who is a huge homophobe.  \n\nI once mentioned to Dursley that I was going to ask Alfred to babysit my kids (boys) for a few hours that weekend.  He freaked out on me and told me that he would NEVER leave his kids alone with Alfred because *gasp* HES GAY! ... my response was \"so I should be afraid to let your wife babysit?\" He said no no his wife is wonderful! and I said, yeah but she's attracted to males too, so shouldnt I worry? NOPE apparently being gay makes you a pedophile.  \n\nMany people do not care to understand the lives of others, and it is very sad that they equate anything other than what they think of as \"normal\" with pedophiles and rapists etc.\n\nI agree with all the advice here to just cut your losses and inform them you will not put up with their bigotry, and that you will continue to attend any family functions you are invited to.  (Unless of course you think it would be a hostile environment for Annie of course.)  Also, tell Annie, I seriously doubt this is the first time she has dealt with bigotry, and especially people assuming pedophilia/rape/lack of morals etc.  It's a very common theme in bigotry.",

            "My wife is MtF, and we similarly haven't told my family. Hearing this just absolutely infuriates me that people could react this way.\n\nI've long since decided that if someone in my life, even if it's my parents or siblings, reacts like this when/if they find out that she's trans, they can bet on never having any sort of contact with me or my wife ever again.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't try to hide this from your fiancee, she's surely used to this sort of reaction, and it will help her not get caught off guard by two faced people near you. I would further completely excise these people from your life, and refuse to even acknowledge their existence from here on.\n\nThere is no excuse for this sort of reaction, whatsoever, and I would not tolerate it.",

            "You need to cut contact after a basic shaming. I say this alot, and I will admit I'm sometimes spiteful. Maximum damage is achieved when you just never respond. It drives people up a fucking wall. People seem to handle hatred better than being ignored. If you can work a bible quote into your break-up, bonus points. Until you get the text that's just -\"I'm sorry, what can I do to be better,\" do not engage. I personally think after you get the text admitting what they did is wrong you should try to begin the long and slow process of rebuilding that relationship. It's totally your right to never speak to them again, I get that, but I try and believe in a fundamental ability for people to change. ",

Let them ponder whether they should send another one or risk going unheard. Because it sounds to me like this person LIVES to stir up self-righteous drama. They are so proud of themselves for standing up to evil (or whatever their small petty minds are thinking right now), let them wonder if their protestations are lost in the ether. \n\nThen be nice (but a little distant, just to make them wonder) at family gatherings and smile and let them wonder. \n\nNothing stings like being ignored.

            "Your relatives reactions are regrettable, but not unexpected. And while there is nothing wrong with you or your girlfriend, i think you could have rolled this out better. \n\nWhen people are suprised, they react in ways that are not always logical or reflective of their normal behavior. You could have potentially mitigated this by informing your family regarding you and your girlfriend's situation, and providing resources to provide greater context. If you are still interested in continuing your relationship with your folks, you could *still* do this. \n\nThat is why what some folks are saying regarding shaming or shunning may be counterproductive, come off as petty, and ultimately not in your best interest.\n\nDan Savage talks on his blog about how in the process of coming out, you should give your family a certain amount of time ( like a year) to get their tantrums out of their system before deciding to cut them off. That may be an approach you want to consider.",
            "Maybe instead of being quick to throw these people to the fire, you could use this as an opportunity to educate them? Ask them what exactly makes her a bad influence for them and then attempt to quash any misguidances or fears.

What did Annie do to you that made you feel uncomfortable?\" and get her to admit flat out that she's a bigot. Respond, \"I see. Annie is a wonderful, gracious human being who has been so kind to your children. Your concern with the status of her genitalia is rude, intrusive, and quite frankly, none of your business. If Annie didn't actually do anything to you, then I'm not sure what I can do to help you. If you are unable to treat her with the same decency and kindness you would treat any other human being then you should be ashamed of yourself.\"",
            "As unfair as it is the way Nosey Nellie treated you and Annie, your reaction to the situation will set the tone for the future of your relationship with your family.  Rage-quitting and calling them bigots may be cathartic, but it's likely to alienate you from your family and cause people to start taking sides which is ultimately destructive to you, your relationship with Annie and the entire family.  I've seen it in my own family.  Even the people who love you and Annie may avoid you just to avoid family tension (especially older members of the family).\n\nI would encourage that you tell Annie immediately.  Regardless of how you handle the situation, she is at the center of it and needs to be made aware of the situation.  It's up to her whether or not she wants the attention and responsibility that comes with educating your family on trans issues.  The very last thing you want to do is to (unintentionally) make Annie feel like she is the cause of a rift in your family.\n\nRegardless of what people are saying here, you CAN change a bigot's mind.  Doing so requires kindness and openness, not aggression and putting them on the defensive.  Especially when their negative reactions are due to fear and ignorance.\n\nFor those relatives that have expressed negative feelings about Annie, it is important to let them know that you are upset with their comments, that Annie is important to you and that you will not be adjusting your behavior based on their comfort levels.  Don't close off all communication and don't put them on the defensive by calling them names or saying something you will regret later.\n\nIf their offensive behavior continues, it may be appropriate to end the relationship, but please don't let that be your first option.  As others have said, trans acceptance has lagged way behind gay acceptance and if you had any indication previously that your family had transphobic thoughts, dropping Annie's transition on them in such a casual way was bound to illicit a reaction.  The way things *should* be isn't always the way things *are* and coming out to friends and family is still something that needs to be handled with tact, even if it was they who initiated the conversation.\n\nAnyway, congratulations on your engagement!  I hope you and Annie have a happy and healthy life together regardless of your family situation.",

This is how I handled backlash when people took issue with my wife.  She is cis, but because she couldn't cook and she was quiet some of my family rejected her.  I rejected them right back and our marriage is still wonderful after all of these years.\n\nYes, it hurts to find out that loved ones are cruel, but at the end of the day they're just blood.

You have to do it *right away* and you maybe should apologize for not letting them know this way.

Sometimes these people actually get over their transphobia, and sometimes, they just get selective about it. \"These trans people are probably pervs and damaged, but not you, no, you are fine, honey, I _know_ you.\"\n\nAt any rate, you'll need to accept that some of your family members are gone from your life. Those are the ones that won't come around even with time. As for the ones that will eventually come around, it is up to you and Annie together, to figure out which will be accepted into your lives again and which have said or done things that are past what you guys can forgive.\n\nAbout telling her, do it ASAP, and reassure her (although, from the tone of your post I don't think this is even necessary) that you have her back and ask her what she wants to do. Does she want to block, ignore, and avoid going to events these people are in? Or does she want to keep up what you guys are doing and everyone that has a problem can change THEIR lives to fit their prejudice?\n\nOne final thing - if any of your family members react badly to being treated like the bigots they are, be careful about wedding related information when the time comes. I am not saying they are going to go as far as picket your special day, but ignorance makes people do some hurtful things, and it'd be a shame if they were to ruin your wedding day, regardless of the type of ceremony/event/party/whatever that you guys have.\n\nEdit: a word",

Not that I'm against transgender or anything, it's just that I see myself dating a female born as a female with female parts and able to produce babies in the future.

And now she can teach you how to deal with this kind of situation. Also, since this is specifically about her, if you don't tell her, then she'll feel like you've been talking about her behind her back, which is never a good feeling.\n\nWhen you and your SO reply, I think you should first assume that they have been mislead in some way to believe that the transgendered are bad for their children. You'll find out if they truly are bigots after they respond.\n\nI think your reply should be something like this:\n\nHi Family, \n\nI wanted to start by saying that we will, of course, respect any boundary's you have. If you don't want us near your or your children, even though we don't agree that our presence is harmful, we will keep our distance if that's what you want.\n\nHowever, it really saddens us that you feel this way. I really hope that if we can talk, maybe we can try and set some less restrictive boundaries.\n\nI know that this circumstance is uncommon. And I can understand if you feel it's strange. I think that it perfectly natural to want to avoid things that feel strange things. And I think that if you take the time to learn about our situation specifically, you'll find that it isn't as strange as it feels. Out of all of our friends, none of us feel that it is strange. Uncommon? yes, but strange? no. So we encourage you to feel free to ask us anything that you might be wondering. And whatever it is that makes you feel uncomfortable, please definitely ask us for our perspective.\n\nTo get the ball rolling, my SO doesn't feel like she's a man who want's lady parts, she truly *feels* and *thinks* like a lady. Unfortunately she was born with the body of a man. This discovery about herself was not an easy one. It took time, self reflection, experimentation, and years of therapy to really understand this about herself. Not just anyone can chose to switch their gender on a whim, only those who are truly one gender inside the body of another (determined by professionals) can have sex reassignment surgery. So if you're worried that your children might be influenced to \"decide\" that they want to switch their gender because of my SO, then therapy will be very effective at sorting that out.\n\nThank you for your consideration in this delicate matter,\n\n<signature>\n\n\nOnly after this converstaion and they haven't changed their mind should you mention that that it's their responsibility to keep track of which events you and them have been invited to, and it's their responsibility to find out if you are going. In no way is this you're responsibility. ",

I'm not talking a one night fling or someone that makes you smile one or twice with a joke.\n\nI think you'll find someone that you really love and that you truly care about. She'll love your face and any hair/lack thereof that you have! You are a beautiful person and you need to realize that you will find happiness.\n\nIf you don't know it, then I will know it for you.\n\nHonestly, I'm sure you can point out flaws in her. Flaws are what makes us who we are. The simple fact that she acted the way she did was ridiculous. Dude. I have a beard, but it's just a rugged thing. I don't know what else to say about it.\n\nI think that you will find an amazing person soon. This could be a person you don't even know yet, or maybe even someone right under your nose. You know what man? Let me know.\n\nLet me know when you find her. When you find her, you'll know that you are worth more than a 100 billion dollars. Don't ever let anyone tell you that you are worth any less. Cheers and heads up man.\n\nLife will be okay! :)",

He always thinks he\u2019s right and said little insults to me I.e why do you buy this brand of food, it\u2019s so bad and always asks me about my ex boyfriends. \n\nI was dating a guy who was a little bigger and his response was \u201cwhy did you date him? He was such a douche and did the bed break when you were with him\u201d\n\nOne night ( a few months ago) he wanted to watch a movie and I agreed. He turned the lights off and halfway through the movie I didn\u2019t feel comfortable. I explained to him I was tired and wanted to go to my room. I left and he started sending me abusive text messages about how I was so rude to leave. I responded back saying I have the right to leave the room if I want to. \n\nI also explained that I didn\u2019t want anything more to do with him than just a housemate- that\u2019s it. He again got angry saying that he only wanted me as a friend. \n\nThis guy walks around in expensive brands and always has to buy the latest Apple product even though he has perfectly good Apple products already. (He works in a grocery store)\n\nRecently, the last 2 weeks, I\u2019ve decided to buy the game UNO to get everyone together and have some fun as usually everyone sits in there seperate rooms and don\u2019t socialise. \n\nThe only person who wants to play UNO is David. He\u2019s starting to ask me questions like: \u201chave you had sex in the shower before\u201d \u201cwe should play UNO in my room\u201d \u201cif you ever want to come into my room, you can\u201d \u201chave you been to a strip club before\u201d \n\nLately he\u2019s said to me \u201cwe should seriously go for a drive\u201d or \u201cwe should go to this particular place where there is a lookout over the city\u201d then when I said \u201cno\u201d he says \u201cwe can go anywhere where you want to go\u201d\n\nLast night he says to me \u201ctomorrow let\u2019s go out for dessert after your work\u201d I said \u201cno, because I just don\u2019t want to\u201d \n\nSince then this guy has completely ignored me and will sit ages away from me on the other side of the room. \n\nIt\u2019s been super awkward and it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s pissed off because I keep rejecting him. \n\nI\u2019m not sure where to go from here or what to say to him?\n\nI really want him to move out of the house.\n\nTLDR: housemate has made advances towards me and is asking inappropriate questions. He is now ignoring me and it\u2019s super awkward.",

            "Please, be careful. I\u2019ve had a creepy housemate who wouldn\u2019t stop harassing me. He went as far as watching me sleep, undressing in front of me (pretending to \u201close\u201d his clothes, pretending to not know I was in the house), would tell me he masturbated thinking about me, tried to ruin my relationships and would act nasty, pouty and downright mean when rejected. \nEven after moving out, I had to deal with him and his stalker behavior for years. He would show up in my house and threatened to ruin my career with false complaints because I didn\u2019t want to sleep with him. I was only 19 when I met him and should\u2019ve been way more cautious, blunt and take it more seriously. Unfortunately, some people around me thought his behavior was way too outlandish to be true because he was \u201ccool\u201d and some even said I was overreacting until it became too obvious. This guy will interpret anything and everything as inviting behavior so be dry, blunt, move out and avoid him at all costs. In the meanwhile, lock your door, always check for hidden cameras, hide your belongings. Never, ever be alone with this guy. Be careful with your information online and if possible don\u2019t have any kind of relationship with his friends or acquaintances.",
            ">I\u2019m not sure where to go from here or what to say to him?\n\nDo nothing. Right now he's sulking but he will be sniffing around again and will take anything (apologies or friendliness) as a green light. You need to shut down the comments, questions, and behavior as they come up. Be as assertive as you can without undermining yourself with \"please\" or \"sorry\".\n\n\"You're making me uncomfortable, knock it off.\"\n\n\"What a rude thing to say.\" (Or \"wow, rude\" if you're feeling bold) \n\n\"If you're going to use my number to text insults or be abusive, I will block you. Going forward only use my number for actual emergencies or things that pertain to the apartment.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not interested in going out with you.\"\n\nDon't cushion the blow or make him feel comfortable for the sale of harmony. He's crossing boundaries and feels he can get away with it because he thinks you're not willing to rock the boat. Talk with your other roommates too about how he's making you uncomfortable and that you're thinking about approaching the landlord.",

            "Also, avoid being alone with him. I would carry some pepper spray with me and plan escape routes just in case. Always trust your gut and never feel sorry for this guy if he makes you feel uncomfortable. Would you be able to install a surveillance camera outside your room door and inside your room as well? Just in case. If he ever threatens you or puts you in a situation where you feel you need to call the police but you\u2019re not sure, call them anyway. Always take your phone wherever you\u2019re going. Read \u201cThe Gift of Fear\u201d for more tips.",
            "One thing that strikes me is that you've bought into the mentality that you need to care about this guy's feelings. You've been polite to him, friendly even, but he's acting entitled to your time and attention even after you said that you didn't want to be more than roommates. If you're not going to move out and you're stuck with him, then... \n1) don't socialize with him at all. You can say hi and bye, but don't ask him how his day was and if he asks you how yours is, just a one word neutral answer is all you give him. \n2) call him on his shitty behavior. When he texts you abusive things, don't respond in text but go into the other room and say \"you can't talk to me this way. You may only message me about the apartment. We're not friends, you have no reason to text me. So don't.\" \n3) STOP FEELING BAD FOR SETTING BOUNDARIES!!! That's how guys like this manage to guilt girls into giving them attention. Is he pathetic? Yes. Do you owe him anything because of it? Absofuckinglutely not. \n4) talk to your other housemates especially the women, and let them know that you're setting this boundary. Ask them if they've had similar interactions with him and give them your support. \n\nSay it with me again ladies - you don't owe him your time or attention.",

I'd also be prepared that he will likely continue to textually harass you. \n\nI also think you're a fantastic person for listening to your intuition and firmly saying 'no' to him - establishing boundaries and learning to say no is such an underrated ability.",
            "If you've got other female living there talk to them to see if they feel the and way. Talk to your landlord, preferably in writing. Say that you think he's a problem and that you don't feel safe with him there (the not feeling safe part is important to get in writing). Some landlords are responsive to this kind of thing, some are not, but most don't want to be sued if something does happen to you and they were aware of the risk.\n\nNext if he harasses you in anyway way that can be captured (text message or Facebook messages) or is witnessed, make sure you keep logs of it. Also very clearly say to him at the time it is occurring that you do not want the interaction and that you do not feel safe around him. Especially if he won't leave you alone after you say that, or even if he does for a while and then it starts back up, go to the police for a restraining order. If you have a restraining order he won't be able to come back home, so he'll almost certainly move out.",

You know this guy is looking for any reason to interact with you. Why would you want to force your roommates to socialize, knowing that he\u2019s a part of that (very small) group?

Or talk to your other roommates and see if they're willing to have him evicted (but that will be awkward and you'd be at risk of him lashing out).\n\n\nThough I don't get what this has to do with anything:\n\n> This guy walks around in expensive brands and always has to buy the latest Apple product even though he has perfectly good Apple products already.

Give him a cold shoulder when he's not respecting boundaries; be respectful in return when he is. With people like this, it's best to just emulate the kind of interactions you want and ignore the rest. Even if you spoke seriously about why you need him to leave you alone, he is probably not mature enough to absorb it, so you have to lead by example.\n\nIf he gets openly difficult or abusive or refuses to respect basic boundaries, you can ask for a house meeting and call him out on it as a group.

You've told him you're not interested in him sexually, but he can still plead ignorance regarding particular behaviors being a problem (genuinely or disingenuously). Remove that plausible deniabity by telling him he needs to stop the behaviors the next time he harasses you. \"David, asking me about my sex life is really inappropriate; don't do that.\" \"David, don't send me angry text messages, I don't appreciate it.\" Once you've done this, or if you've already done it, you can go to your housemates and tell them David has to go because he's been harassing you, you've asked hin to stop (clearly and directly!), and he won't stop. Since you've removed any ambiguity, you've undercut the common apologetics for harassment, and your housemates' reactions will tell you what to do: you either have their support in kicking David out or you need to get away from all of them because they're intent on enabling his behavior.\n\nThere may be a way you're sabatoging your own efforts so far: you seem interested in a sort of shared living arrangement in which your other housemates are not especially interested, where you get along well hanging out together and do shared activities on a regular basis. I read their lack of interest from the existing pattern of hanging out seperately in your own rooms and their disinterest in a game night, and your interest from that suggestion and the fact that you present the fact that the guy who's been bothering you is now ignoring you as a problem about which you need to do something rather than a successful assertion of boundaries. You can still be friendly and pursue friendship if they're also interested, but they may not be, so it might help to let go of the idea that there's anything to fix if David continues to leave you alone and your relationship with your housemates is polite but distant (or even avoidant).\n\nAnd if you are really interested in a kind of household dynamic in which your other housemates are not, it may be a good idea to consider looking for other housing irrespective of the David problem.",

When he mocks you for drawing a boundery you say well I don't know why you would have a problem with me setting my own boundaries I quess this conversation is over, goodbye. Some people push against others boundaries till they are way over the line. He is either a creepy guy you need to be careful of or he likes you and is inept at relationships.

Maybe it will be much limited and you can set boundaries, and maybe it gets really bad and he tries to assault you or some shit  (that's the worst case, depending on what type of person he is).. so ye if you can just leave and give yourself a break from all the be don't hesitate.   \nWith these things I don't suggest having the mentality of \"no im not going to run away\" and all the brave stuff, there is a person living in the same house who is physically stronger than you and probably have bad intentions, be a coward, put your safety first, life is just much better when you don't have memories of frkn sexual assault.",

Without going into the scarier details, I think you should talk to your other roomies and discuss his privilege of living in the house. You deserve to live in a safe environment. He should be given his 30days. \n\nLegally, in case he tries something, you need to send him a text requesting that he not contact you unless it is house related, as he has on multiple occasions made you feel uncomfortable and been invasive.\n\nThen don\u2019t worry if he acts like a pouty little beez, cuz you have every right to unapologetically request a safe zone of a home.",

He smiled really big and genuine and said he'd love it. Why not tonight?\n\nI couldn't believe he actually said yes, and even wanted to do it THAT NIGHT. No excuses, no pushing it back for weeks. I was fucking ecstatic.\n\nWe couldn't decide on a film, so we started talking about TV shows, and decided to just watch Breaking Bad, since we'd both watched it and enjoyed it before.\n\nTbh we talked through most of it, but it felt amazing to just be able to let go and be comfortable around him outside of work.\n\nThanks to everyone who talked to me and helped me!\n\nTLDR; I decided to ask my coworker to hang out and it was great.

You're insecure and you never had a real GF.\n\nHe sounds like a good guy, he'll probably offer to be your wingman!\n\nDon't be jealous of your friends. They are there to push you up, not to bring you down. So push him up and he'll do the same for you.",
            "First of all well done for putting your insecurities to one side to accept another person's company, don't mistake it for jealousy.\n\nThis friendship can offer you a lot in terms of becoming a stronger and more self aware person. As you get to know each other more just be open about yourself, he'll appreciate it and he could actually really help you become a more confident individual!\n\nBut also do ensure you don't simply displace your self-esteem issues onto him, be a positive influence to him also.

            "That\u2019s great that it worked out for you guys! Making friends can be hard. I had a friend in hs that I felt was prettier than me. I had low self esteem, and she didn\u2019t, while I acted like it. She was more open and got flirted with more, or so I thought. Turns out, guys flirted with me all the time, I was just too paranoid to believe it. It always felt like a joke at my expense. Once I accepted that, I could let go of my jealousy.

You\u2019ll find that it\u2019s amazing to have someone to talk to about these things that could slowly help you become less insecure.\n\nYou should know, though, that *most* people are insecure, even the ones that seem to be very confident, ones you feel are good looking, ones that are rich, etc\u2026 I don\u2019t know if it helps you feel less alone to know this but it IS true. Many people that seem confident are faking it, which isn\u2019t a bad thing. I think it helps get them to a place where they really do become confident in themselves.

It was becoming a junior web designer at a company. I'd been interested in it for a while and I have been teaching myself how to do it amongst other things by using books, reddit and just reading about it online. It's been fun and I've been loving it. Anyway, I work at a typical job, a supermarket and I have been looking for another job for a while as I wanted a career and to start doing something with my life. I mainly do online job searching. I saw the job advertisement for a junior web designer at this company and they said they would teach you everything on the job, no experience needed. Seemed ideal to me and I thought I'd give it a shot. What's the worst that can happen? So a couple of days after applying I got a e-mail and then a phone call from HR and they said they wanted me to come in for a first round interview. Of course I said yes. \n\nI went along to the interview, very nervous as this was the first 'real' job I've ever had an interview for. I asked for advice from some co-workers and that helped me feel better and get a clearer head. I got there a littl early and waited nervously. \n\nThe assessments were for English, Maths and Logic. Now, I will be the first to admit, I do really suck at maths. I just don't get it. I can't really do it. I'm not totally unable but it gets hazy when percentages, fractions, diving large numbers, times tables, ect it gets hard for me. But I have been trying to improve my maths! It sounds stupid but I've been doing maths homework with my younger brother who is in secondary school, final year, and it's been helping me out loads. I got maths training games too. \n\nSo I did the assessments and I didn't really do well at the maths I thought. I came out of the interview feeling unconfident but I tried to not let that show through. They said they will be in contact with me. \n\nA day later, I got a Facebook message in my outbox and it was from someone I didn't know. I read through this message and was gobsmacked. I don't know what to think. Here is the message: \n\n\"Hi OP,\n\nI am just e-mailing you to let you know you definitely won't be getting there job at _____. You are a different shade of absolute stupidity. I work here and I'm the head of the department of which you applied for. I would never in my life ever employ someone who is as utterly simple and unable to do maths. It's a shame as you aced your other tests. But English and logic aren't a sign of intelligence to me. Maths is. You should be ashamed of yourself and go pick up a maths book and learn. No one will take you seriously in life. I seriously hope you take my advice. Your life won't be anything more than menial jobs. \n\nTake care, \n\nAsshole.\"\n\nReddit. I am so upset. I know he's right. I am stupid. I just don't know what to think. What the hell do I do?! I feel worthless.  \n   \n**tl;dr**: Applied for job, suck at maths, did assessments, head f dpt who analysed tests messaging me on fb calling me stupid, I won't do anything with my life, ect. \n\nEDIT: I can't reply to any comments because the post is locked and I went to sleep soon after posting this as it was getting late. I will when I can. I do really appreciate all of the comments and advice. I have some thinking to do about how to go forward with this. Also, I say 'maths' because I'm from the UK. That's just how we say it. ",

I imagine you telling your IRL or Facebook friends afterwards: \"I really want that job but I'm worried I failed the math test! I'm sooooo bad at math!\" and one of your frenemies spitefully sending a fake message to prey on your insecurities.\n\nI know that sounds far-fetched, but I find it easier to believe than the idea that:\n\n- the head of a department would send a facebook message instead of an email\n- a total stranger would feel the need to personally insult and berate another stranger\n- that an employee would take the time to do so instead of just saying, \"Sorry, we chose another applicant.\"\n- that they would know exactly where to hit you where it hurts the most\n- that they would not know the name of their own department\n- that you failed as poorly as you suspect, when you are actively studying to improve your math skills\n\nWho did you tell about your interview? Maybe coworkers at your current job, who don't want to see you leave?\n\nI don't advise forwarding the message to HR as others have suggested. Instead, find out if they even HAVE an employee named Chad Asshole or whatever. My guess is that they don't.",

That is...the most ludicrous thing I've ever seen, and I used to work for a company that was sued (deservedly so) regularly. \n\nI suck REALLY HARD at mathematics. I can barely help my son with his 9th grade homework. I'm a psychologist and have had a successful career. My husband sucks at math too-- somewhat less than me because he's able to limp along well enough to help our son through homework without losing the will to live, but still, pretty bad. He's a tech writer with an extremely successful career and makes enough to support our entire family by himself. \n\nI'm sorry that a person who sucks at life, made you feel badly for sucking at math. What this person thinks of you is none of your business and I PROMISE, truly, I swear, this person's message was not about you. The message was about this person's own self hatred.

I completely suck at math as well, always have. I even failed it the same math course 3 times in HS. I find math to be a completely different ball game when it comes to using a computer and programming. It's not going to hold you back. Also, I've never had to do an aptitude test like that as part of an interview, so don't give up and keep applying for places.",

Seriously, though, you're probably not stupid.  Nothing about the way you write says \"stupid\" to me.  \n\nEdit:  I do a full time job, with zero supervision, that involves putting eight people who may or may not ever have ridden a motorcycle on motorcycles for two days, and shepherding them through where to go, what to do, and how to do better at it.  There are also five hours in the classroom that involves making them do all the work and only stepping in when they start to wander away from what they need to learn.  It's the joy of my life, and according to the state and the reviews the students leave online, I'm very smart and very good at it.  And when I miscount students for a moment, or find myself with one fewer cone than I thought I needed, or announce their lunch and am met with questions on whether I really meant to give them a five minute lunch hour, I say \"Oh darn it, math is hard, Barbie tells me so,\" and we all snicker and things are just fine.  I'm not saying math is important, but I AM saying that being math-weak doesn't mean you're screwed forever.",
            "Your interviewer (or their boss) would *never* write this.\n\n\nWhy? For one, nobody with this kind of mindset manages to both get and keep a public-facing job; it is just too unprofessional. More importantly, *anybody* in the media industry knows that it takes just a forward to some news outlet (all of them, from the smallest blogger to your biggest newspaper *loves* shit like this), and they will be out of a job while the company they worked for would drown in a storm of bad publicity. This is *not* coming from them.\n\n\n**It almost surely comes from someone you know personally** . Somebody is trolling you.\n\n\n**Do not* forward this message to the company like some other posters suggest -  they will not *want* to believe you, and it will certainly not help you land the job (which you have *not* gotten an official response to yet).\n\n\nBtw, some of the posters here seems to not know the distinction between a web *developer* and a web *designer*. Yeah, math is a huge advantage for doing programming. Logic is even more important. But a designer is not a *programmer*. Artistic skills, some language skills, an understanding of typography, things like that, is what you need. Photoshop knowhow, HTML, CSS and some basic Javascript are the tools, and none of those requires math you cannot do on a basic calculator. Web design is, fundamentally, about understanding how people think when they use a screen and then draw solutions that promotes usability and branding; it's about psychology, not math.\n\n\nSo, keep going! Learn what you can online, and take some classes to get something on your resume; you will find a position without being a math wizard.\n",
            "What a jerk! What an absolute jerk. You did nothing wrong and this adult man went out of his way to make you feel bad about yourself. It's super lame that he doesn't have anything better to do than shit on people half his age. \n\nSo, now that the ranting indignation is over, I have actual real advice for you.\n\nI work as a junior web designer and I can tell you about .0005% of my job is math. In fact, the only real math I did today was calculating out a grid... i.e. How wide is my page and how many columns do I want? 960 px wide with 12 columns... Hmm 960/12=80 px wide columns. Seriously. That is the full extent of the math I did today. \n\nWeb design is more about creating intuitive experiences for the users. Yes, it needs to be visually appealing (appropriate fonts, color scheme, visual hierarchy, etc.) but it's a lot more about how it works. And you, my dear, were raised on pixels. You grew up post-Internet (like me) so you already have a leg up... You just know where buttons \"should\" be or where it'd be helpful to have a link, or what's the best way to treat certain pieces of content. Math is such a small part of what I do and you absolutely do not need a strong math background to get into web design. (That being said, web development is different. It's split into front-end development which uses HTML/CSS/etc. (still not a ton of math) and back-end dev which involves Computer Science and does sometimes require more math and logic skills.)\n\nDo **not** let this fucker make you give up. You should join us over at /r/graphic_design to get more familiar with current aesthetics and design principles. Another good sub, though not terribly active, is /r/frontend. It'll help get you familiar with front-end development if you want. A designer-developer is like the \"unicorn\" in this industry and having those skills could only help. It's going to seem super intimidating and technical at first but please do not give up. You can do this. \n\nIf you PM me, I'd be more than happy to give you some career advice, point to some resources, help focus your efforts. Seriously. I wouldn't mind at all. Good luck!\n\n",
            "Like many other posters I also suspect that the message you were sent is from a fake account. \n\nIf it is a fake account, unfortunately I think it is likely to be someone you know personally, a colleague or one of your 'friends'. Someone who wants to put you down for some reason. Someone who knew you were nervous about the maths test. \n\nI suppose it's also possible that it's from someone else within the company you applied to, but that seems unlikely. You'd have to be pretty mentally unbalanced to send this to a stranger. What does this person have to gain by doing this? ",
            "Are you kidding me?! He's the idiot for sending this to you. You have so many methods of recourse.

            "You are NOT stupid just because you may not be the greatest in math. I have my master's degree and guess what? When I add and subtract things I still have to use my fingers. Algebra kicked my ass, it's the only class I ever failed. I sucked at math on the sat and gre, like laughably so. Science kicks my ass, too. That does NOT mean I'm stupid.

If you don't hear from the company soon, I'd send a friendly follow-up to check on your status. If you're in, great. If not, there's other jobs out there. Only then would I follow up with a screencap to HR.\n\nDon't accuse them of running a BS company full of assholes. Just say very calmly that you got this strange message and is this from one of their employees? If it's a real employee, they can handle it. If it's not, then you have a weird security leak probably among your social circle.",

I've known many people who are great at math but are atrocious writers. Everyone has weak spots and that's ok. \n\nIf you want to get a bit better at math (for yourself, not this jackass), the Kahn Academy is a free resource online.

            "Dude. Think of the bullet you just dodged. Could you IMAGINE working a day with that guy? Imagine if you had to ask a question about basically anything. What a turd. Send this to all the bosses at the company-- chances are he's abusing his employees and they feel as upset as you do at this moment every day of their lives. Hell hes lucky he didn't send that to someone like me... I'd send it to sites like yahoo and buzzfeed with his name and the company's name and watch him burn all over the country. \n\nP.S. Being bad at math doesn't make you stupid. Don't let anyone tell you that. ",
            "OK, I'm going to try to depart from what everyone else is saying here and focus on your obvious insecurities with your math skills. I'm a software engineer who just quit my job to go back to school to study math at the graduate level so I'm only halfway qualified to say anything. \n\nFirst, you probably do suck at math but that's ok and it doesn't make you stupid. I'll be the first to admit that 90% of the time I suck at math and I still manage to get by as a young professional in the field of mathematics so my first caution to you (in the words of Douglas Adams) are, \"Don't Panic!\" Being bad at math is like being bad at a language you haven't learned. You can't feel badly about not speaking fluent French, you've barely studied any French in your life (maybe, I don't know you). If you want to be good at Math you have to *learn* to be good at Math and I can see that you've taken some steps but secondary school math and some games aren't going to cut it for the level of logic that is expected of programmers. \n\nSecond, this is a point I try to drive home to all of my friends when I help them learn math or programming (I do this quite a bit), *Math should make sense.* Most of the problems I see people encounter with mathematics stem from them taking something on faith and trying to memorize an algorithm for solving very specific problems. If you can't understand why you're doing something, what your doing, or why it works, the minute a small change is made to the circumstances, you won't know how to react and reassess. The reaction IS math and almost everyone is incapable of it due to faulty teaching methods that go back for forever. When you are relearning math, it is crucial that you convince yourself that everything you learn *makes sense.* \n\nSo what should you do? There are great books to buy for programming interviews. They are more geared toward more technical programming interviews but are incredibly valuable in my opinion. These books are, Cracking the Coding Interview and Programming Interviews Exposed. In addition to these you need to really assess where you're at in terms of education, and there is no shame in finding out that you need to start at basic algebra. It's simply a matter of buying the write book, finding the write online courses, or finding the right night courses, whatever works for you. But it NEEDS to be more formalized then helping your little brother with math or some games that are incidentally related to mathematical logic. \n\nI assure you, OP, you are not stupid. Teaching yourself web dev, even if only a little, is an incredibly hard thing to do and requires intelligence. Being good at math requires training. Whoever this person is, they have no right to speak to you that way and no basis for doing so. When I interviewed for grad school I had some of the worst interviews imaginable. I couldn't even solve the most basic of problems at times. Interviews are very scary things and this was your first, so beyond not judging yourself for your intelligence based off of something that is entirely learned and doesn't come intuitively to you like math I also would be careful not to judge yourself by the results of this or any future interviews to come. \n\nConclusion: Don't let this get you down. Turn on the attack mode and go kick some ass. Everything standing in your way is something that can be tackled, which means your goals are within sight. Don't let your self esteem in your intelligence be determined by the outcome of your FIRST interview. \n\nMore resources: \n\ncoursera.com : online courses \n\nudacity.com : online courses \n\nprojecteuler.com : programming problems to keep your mind sharp (very hard, reading solutions will help you learn to think more mathematically) \n\n/r/math is always here for you and we're a great community.

For both companies in tech and finance.  I have never, ever encountered a response like that. It's rude and unprofessional at best,  and I think HR and his boss would be very interested in seeing that a guy they let manage people treats people so poorly. \n\nPlease, please, try to get in contact with the HR department.

While yes, being really good at math can be a sign of brilliance, it is by NO means a solid indicator. If you devote enough time to it, you will inevitably get good at it, though it requires A LOT of time. I have seen tons of people being good at math, but are not that intelligent, they only got good because they studied 24/7.

The job was described as requiring no experience so, as I have been teaching myself web development and really enjoying it, I decided to apply.\n\nAfter my interview, I was told that I would be contacted. The following day, I received this message on Facebook from one of your employees who claimed to be a department head:\n\n'[Asshole's message]'\n\nThis sort of behavior, apart from being uncalled for and personally insulting, is an incredibly poor reflection on your company. I am confident that you will want to deal with this situation as promptly and tactfully as possible.\n\nI do not at this time intend to share this message with the media or anyone else, but I do expect that the situation will be handled appropriately. Please do inform me of what steps you intend to take to rectify this unfortunate decision on the part of your employee.\n\nRegards,\n\n[Your Name]\"\n\nYou can change the last bit to ask for a specific outcome(s) you desire (that the employee be punished or their employment terminated, that you be apologized to, etc.), or you can leave the expectations bit out entirely if you want it to be a bit more open-ended.\n\nIf this were my employee, they would be gone. This sort of unstable, hostile, and completely unnecessary behavior would be grounds for termination in my eyes. I would recommend against going to the media because it is possible for it to hurt future employment opportunities for you. Mentioning it, on the other hand, might make this asshole's bosses realize that you are serious and that you understand what will hurt them.\n\nSorry this happened to you. This person had no right to talk to you that way, and you really shouldn't take a single word of it to heart. Plenty of people out there looking for any opportunity to try to make someone else feel bad because it's the only way they can ever feel good. Whether you pursue anything with the company or not, make sure to move past this as soon as you can because it isn't worth your time to dwell on it.",
            "'Logic isn't a sign of intelligence to me'\n\nHahaha fuck this guy",
            "1st, I'm really sorry about that OP. That guys an ass and I definitely know how you feel. But math isn't the only thing that matters in the world. No company in their right mind would turn down an applicant that aces 2/3 assessments but does poorly on the last one. Hell math isn't even that important for a junior web designer. Which brings me to number 2...\n\n2nd, I highly, HIGHLY doubt that guy is who he says he is. Facebook is an incredibly unprofessional way to contact someone, and saying shit like that is a million times more unprofessional. If he really is who he says he is, if the company ever found out about that he would get his ass kicked, probably fired even. If I were you I would talk to someone who you actually know works there and make sure someone higher up sees those messages. Even if you really don't get the job, that guy will get whats coming to him for being so horrible.\n\n3rd, Like I said above, I know exactly how you feel, but just know you are NOT useless, you are in NO way stupid. Assuming he's telling the truth, you did do great on english and logic right?Sure you might not like math, but who the fuck does? I friends majoring and doing well in engineering and they hate math. The point is, don't feel bad because of one bad assessment. Focus on what you did well on, and try t find jobs that use those skills! If you really want to be a web designer dont give up because of one bad experience. Find a better company/work environment and move one. Keep your head up OP!",
            "This makes me so angry.  I cannot believe someone would go through the effort to contact you on Facebook and be so unprofessional (assuming this person works for that company) and cruel.  I'm not sure what happened to him in his life to make him feel like this was an appropriate action to take, but he is obviously a small and petty person. \nPlease don't let him make you feel stupid.  You obviously are not.  And you are most certainly not worthless.  ",

They can either show that they don't tolerate behavior like that or if they don't immediately terminate that person that company needs to have their true colors shown to the world via the internet. \n\nThis is literally the biggest lack of professionalism I have ever seen in my life. It literally makes me sick.

The type of asshole who would send a nasty message to a kid to discourage her from trying to grow! \n\nOP, understand something: what he did is not the behavior of a responsible, respectable professional. That man is a fuck boy, and his opinion on your intelligence is completely unworthy of your consideration. Caring about what people like him think will hold you back from your goals. It\u2019s a blessing from the Universe that you did not get hired there because a smart, good kid like you should not be subjected to such discouragement.\n\nNow let me tell you why you are a smart, good kid, and why you deserve a good opportunity in which you can further develop your budding skills and grow professionally. I\u2019m a university librarian, and 90% of my job involves interacting with students to support their academic work. Most of our students are young adults, like you, in their early 20s. Our students come from varying academic backgrounds and have varying natural abilities that cause them to struggle in some subjects, but excel in others. That\u2019s normal, and is true at all levels of education.  But, natural ability and background are not always what distinguishes a student from her peers at this level. It\u2019s the level of effort that some students put into their time here that makes some stand out while others don\u2019t.  Now, I love all my kids and I believe in them. But I especially favor the disciplined, hard-workers. These students take their studies seriously. They know their own strengths and weaknesses and know when they need help and how to get it. They take advantage of growth opportunities. Most importantly, they have goals to keep themselves motivated and they are very focused on developing the skills they need to reach those goals, even if that means they have to work twice as hard as the next student. To my thinking, these are the smart students! These are the ones you know will be ok and will do well. Reading your post OP, you sound like my favorite students! Here is what I mean:\n\nOn having a goal and working to develop your web design skills:\n\n>I wanted a career and to start doing something with my life.\n\n>I'd been interested in it for a while and I have been teaching myself how to do it amongst other things by using books, reddit and just reading about it online.\n\nOn taking opportunities seriously, knowing your weaknesses and when to get help:\n\n>I saw the job advertisement for a junior web designer at this company and they said they would teach you everything on the job, no experience needed. Seemed ideal to me and **I thought I'd give it a shot**.\n\n>I went along to the interview, very nervous as this was the first 'real' job I've ever had an interview for. **I asked for advice from some co-workers** . . .\n\n>I have been trying to improve my maths! . . . I've been doing maths homework with my younger brother who is in secondary school, final year, and it's been helping me out loads. I got maths training games too.\n\nThese are not the thoughts, words, and actions of a stupid person! What amazes me most is that you, a 21 year old, seem to be making these efforts on your own without pressure from parents. You are self-motivated! This is a character strength that can potentially carry you far in life!! You ARE NOT stupid!! You hear me?? You\u2019re NOT!! It\u2019s just that math is not a strength for you. But you have so much else going for yourself that I cannot see how that will hinder your future success in whatever you choose to do. \n\nOP, I understand this threw you off and your feelings are hurt. But it\u2019s important that you do everything you can to not let this message penetrate your psyche. You are on the right track and you have the spirit it takes to do well at whatever you choose. You are going to be just fine.\n\nI think it\u2019s CRUCIAL that you follow the advice of the others in these comments and take steps to get this guy reported. He should not be allowed to continue to function without consequences. I swear, trying to tear down young people who just want to make something of themselves should be a crime!!\n\n**Tl; dr**: Facebook message guy is an asshole and a fuck boy.

I actually googled  synonyms for unintelligent because I couldn't think of a word that described this level of it.\n\nHow off his rocker is this guy to send something that would *so obviously get himself fired?* Is he some sort of closet narcissist? I just can't even fathom it.\n\nRant aside, report it to his superiors. Watch him get fired, and message him back on facebook about where he figures common sense and empathy rank on the scale of basic intelligence in juxtaposition to math.\n\nWhat a fucking twit.",

The wording of the message was completely inappropriate and possibly broke the law (I won't definitely say it broke the law as I'm not qualified to say that). \n\nI will say the sender of the message did something that is wrong and I hope they wind up losing their job because of it.

But there is never any good reason to be rude about it.",
            "LOL that guy is an idiot.",
            "First of all. Fuck that guy , second of all if you don't suck at something you'll never get good at it and 3 of all who does this guy think he is. Whatever he says it's just his opinion it means nothing ."
