        "selftext": "I've lived in this apartment complex since I moved out of my parents house when I was 18. I love this building, love my home, and I've never had a problem with any of the other tenants. \n\nA new family just moved into the apartment next to mine. At first, everything was fine. Their son was a little noisier than I'd like, but it's just something to get used to.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, the Mom approached me and took me to the side. She told me that she liked the apartment, everything was fine, except for one thing: her son's room was next to mine, and he could very obviously hear me having sex with my boyfriend.\n\nI apologized and said I'd try to keep things a little quieter. She told me that she thinks it's for the best if I move my bedroom, or have sex somewhere else, just in case her son hears. I told her that wasn't going to happen, but I would definitely try to be more courteous about timing.\n\nFast forward to this past week. My boyfriend (who lives with me part-time, but is a grad student on the go most of the time, so we don't always see each other) was over, and we ended up having sex. It was probably 4 in the afternoon. While we're going at it, there's a knock on the door. I'm not expecting anyone, so we ignore it, and the knocking continues.\n\nThen comes the shouting. I need to stop, I'm being disgusting, don't I know there's a child in the next apartment, I'm a degenerate, I'm a slut, I'm a hooker, etc etc etc. She went away eventually, but not after yelling some more.\n\nNow, I don't know. Am I being unreasonable about this? I don't think it's fair for me to have to adhere to someone else's schedule just because their son shares a wall with me. We aren't screaming banshees and slapping the headboard against the wall, but we're two adults doing what we love doing. \n\nThe woman caught me leaving for work this morning and told me that if I didn't stop \"exposing myself\" to her son, she would have me arrested for child endangerment. No idea if that's even a thing. \n\nWhat am I to do here?\n\n**TL/DR:** Woman thinks I am the devil because her son shares a wall with me, and he can hear me and my boyfriend having sex. I'm not about to stop having sex in my apartment, but I would like this to stop.",

            "Tell your landlord about this situation ASAP.  Point out that yo  have a history -- a long history -- with no complaints (I'm assuming) so far, and this neighbor is being unreasonable AND ALSO HARASSING YOU.  Then, next time she comes around and is being a fucking lunatic outside your door, call the police!  ",
            "It may be embarrassing, but I'd document the harassment and then approach your landlord before she can. You've lived in this building for years and presumably have had no complaints made about you before. If you head her off at the pass with a record of the offensive, intrusive things she's said to you, you stand a better chance of getting your landlord on your side.",

She's delusional.\n\n\nAs a parent, I wouldn't want my kid to hear that.  But, I'm not going to make it someone else's problem when it is very clearly mine.  You aren't responsible for her child, she is.  She needs to put her big girl panties on, and deal with the situation on her end, not by asking you to change your life for her benefit. \n\n\nYou've already promised to try to be quieter (which is very considerate), you've done what you can.  At this point, I'd say she's harassing you.\n\n\nIgnore her.  I doubt anyone sane would take her very seriously.\n\n\nI mean, if you were screaming at the top of your lungs and were refusing to be considerate at 3 am, that's different...

The irony. It hurts. \n\n>told me that if I didn't stop \"exposing myself\" to her son, she would have me arrested for child endangerment. No idea if that's even a thing.\n\nUhm. I don't think this is a thing. You didn't expose yourself. \n\nTalk to your landlord, tell them what she has been doing (screaming outside your door at 4am, etc, threatening you, etc). \n\nYour neighbor is nuts. It's her kid. She should move bedrooms with him if she thinks it's such a problem. ",
            "She should move her son's room if this is a concern to her. She can get a sound machine, hang heavy drapes and add other soft goods to muffle the sounds from her neighbors. It ain't your problem. ",

(Her accusation of \"degeneracy\" makes me wonder.)\n\nIf she wants to completely control every aspect of her child's environment (which is pretty much impossible anyway), she shouldn't be living in an apartment complex. Talk to your landlord, document any further incidents, and if she comes around banging on your door again let her know that you will call the police if she continues harassing you.",
            "You need to report her harassment to your landlord. Screaming derogatory comments like that is totally inappropriate. Having sex in your own home is totally reasonable and normal. If you aren't having especially loud sex and you are doing it at a reasonable time when it's unlikely to wake people up or whatever then there is nothing else you should have to worry about. People have sex, and people have the right to have sex in their own homes free of harassment like this. When you live in a densely populated area like an apartment building it's inevitable that occasional sounds of people having sex will be heard. Your crazy neighbor needs to come back to reality or find somewhere else to live.",

            "Tell the management that she is harassing you, because banging on the door, screaming at you, and a costing you in the parking lot is harrassment. \n\nOn your lease it should have a clause about you having the right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises. It should also have a clause about quiet times, which are possibly for something like 9:00 pm - 7:00 am. It sounds like you were peacefully enjoying the premises during a time that was not a designated quiet time. \n\nI am not a lawyer, and you should probably run this by /r/legaladvice.

I don't think you're doing anything wrong, I'm actually stunned that she would even try and make you switch rooms in your own apartment. ",

The fact that she's willing to expose him to this horror until *you* do something about it means she's just being purposely awkward, and kind of a bitch.",
            "practical advice:\n\nmove your bed a tiny bit away from that wall. just give it some cushion. pay attention to the noises your bed makes, against the floor, and against the walls, and springs etc.\n\nmake up a sexy playlist and get some speakers. put them touching the wall, hell even point it at them and play music when you do it. pull up the bass a bit, it may annoy them but they can't complain if you are actually making an effort to shield their child's delicate ears. \n\nif you're not into a soundtrack, a white noise thing might help a tiny bit as well.\n\nin my apartment, i don't hear my neighbors sexing, ever. unless it is the absolute middle of the night deadly silent. this means the regular ambient noises of: fans, showers, exhaust fans, talking, tv, etc, are jusssst enough to cover sex noises that are happening at literally any moment other than between 2 and 5 am. between 2 and 5, when i hear it, i swear, it's SO CRISP i feel like they are in the room with me.\n\none time i heard some sex from outdoors (middle of the day) , and i went inside out of curiosity, so literally 3 inches of difference and inside with door closed could hear nothing. even leaning up against the door, the window, listening. outdoor, so clear that she must've had a window open and directing her voice directly at it. so ambient noise is a factor.\n\nnot that you are obligated to do this, but personally i hate being the noisy neighbor (sex or otherwise) and i have found that these things help. also; padded carpeting, door draft stoppers.\n\nETA: the best music to sex to is the Jurassic Park soundtrack, free tip.",
            "Agreed that she is being completely unreasonable.  This is an APARTMENT.  It shares walls.  With people.  Potentially numerous ones.  I'm sorry but the expectation that there should be zero noise from neighbors is short-sided and unrealistic.  I would tell her that you've done what you can but the fact of the matter is that hearing things through walls is part of the price of admission for opting for an apartment or condo versus a single family home.  Whether it's moving her son's room, getting a sound machine, or something else, it's her problem to deal with.  You've already made a respectful gentleman's effort.",
            "Talk to your landlord/management *immediately* (as in today) and tell them that your neighbors are harassing you. Because that's what they are doing. Don't let your neighbors complain first. If they continue to harass you, go to the police.",
            "> Woman thinks I am the devil because her son shares a wall with me\n\nNo she doesn't. She thinks you're the devil because you're gay.\n\nHaving sex in your own home is not child endangerment, by the way. As long as you aren't in violation of any noise laws or rules, you don't have to bow to the whims of your neighbor.\n\nSo if you all were my tenants, I'd approach this as follows. I'd see if this could be resolved by some type of \"gentlemen's agreement\" to turn the TV or some type of music up during times of intimacy in exchange for her ceasing to act like a crazed lunatic. And if that were insufficient, I'd allow the new tenant to move to a different unit fee-free as long as she cleaned her unit into move-in ready condition.\n\n",
            "> The woman caught me leaving for work this morning and told me that if I didn't stop \"exposing myself\" to her son, she would have me arrested for child endangerment. No idea if that's even a thing. \n\nBe super careful dude. Not sure where you live, but if it's in the US, you don't want to be messing around with a crazy woman like this. She is trying to build a case against you. It's very worrying that she used that language (I assume you are not paraphrasing). \n\nDepending on how things shake down, you could be hearing from the police about this. Are there sodomy laws where you live?",
            "People gave enough suggestions to follow through with landlord. \n\nI'll give you a workaround, put on some music or TV... if they complain say you're watching HBO.\n",
            "Definitely take the majority advice here.\n\nI'd talk to the landlord, and give him a written copy of the interactions.  Email it, so there's a trail that you told him about it.  Definitely point out you haven't had any issues in the decade living there (if that is indeed the case).\n\nI'd watch the noise too.  Maybe she doesn't like the sex part, or the gay part.  Either way, if she's crazy enough to stick a recording device with a sensitive microphone against your shared wall and/or door, could it pick it up?  Regardless if you're at an appropriate volume level or not, her having a recording she can claim is from within her home that seems to be you having 'loud boisterous sex' might be considered indecent.  I mean, I'm no prude, but if my kid could hear two people of any gender having loud, wild, vulgarity filled sex, I'd be displeased (not saying you're doing that, but hopefully you catch my drift).\n\nTell her degenerate son to stop sticking his ear to the wall.\n\nBut seriously, get out in front of the situation and double-down on protecting yourself and keep your sex at a minimum for a couple weeks.  That would give the landlord a chance to digest and (hopefully) speak to the other tenant as well.",

Banging on your door, shouting, and generally acting like a lunatic is not ok - it is a disturbance to you and to others. Threatening you in the halls is not ok. \n\nYour complaints about her might be corroborated by others, if they have not already complained about her hallway tirade. I assume you've never been a problem tenant, and the longer you've been there the better. If she tries to make a noise complaint against you, it will be important to note that she just moved in and is the first to say a word about you. If there are other units sharing any boundary (above, below, sides) with you that will matter too, since they have no issue and you have not changed your routine. She is the *only* one with any problem and is brand new to the building and stirring up trouble.\n\nYou could even complain about the noise from her kid's room, in case anyone else sharing a boundary with it has filed a similar complaint. Kid feet on your ceiling can be a legitimate noise complaint - they are deceptively loud and often people don't even realize it until they hear it from below for themselves.\n\nDo not be defensive about it. She's done more wrong than you, and you've already taken reasonable steps to reduce a level of noise which was likely not an issue in the first place (nobody has ever complained). Noise complaints are generally more consistent - music thumping for too long, loud TV, kids feet hammering on floors, that sort of thing. For more intermittent noise it has to be quite bad, or else we'd be sending out warnings for vacuums, coffee grinders, laundry buzzer, tenderizing a steak, forgetting something and walking across the hardwood in heels, etc...\n\nWorst case, if you're concerned with her threat, call the police non-emergency number. They could tell you easily enough if it is worth opening a file and recording some basic info. Having a case number as early as possible can only help you, should things ever escalate, but if that's overkill I'm sure the officer who calls you back would say so before wasting much time.",

        "selftext": "Yes reddit, I know how hilarious this sounds and I promise you this is not a joke as I am genuinely freaking out right now. I am soon finishing up secondary school (high school) and I'm looking for my very first job for the summer, so when I was filling out my resum\u00e9 I didn't have a lot of experience to mention so I decided to do a hobbies and passions section, taking advice from others.\n\nI (stupidly) left my laptop out on the kitchen table today while I went to the shop to get some tea, and my gobshite of a sister thought it would be the joke of the century to delete my hobbies & passions section and replace everything with a single bullet point saying \"garlic bread\".\n\nNow, I had closed the Word Document, saving it, before leaving. She opened it, changed it without telling me, and saved it and closed it before I came back. She knows bloody well that I'm looking for jobs at the moment and she knew I'd spent the afternoon working on my resum\u00e9.\n\nI came home with the tea anyway and since I was happy with my resum\u00e9 (I didn't bother to recheck it, I had no idea someone would change it to \"garlic bread\" while I was gone) I sent it to multiple job applications from an online hiring site, which had places hiring in my town. I'd say I sent this garlic bread resume to about twenty to thirty institutions in total.\n\nIt was only after I sent them that I decided to re-check my resum\u00e9, when I noticed the horrific alteration. I am absolutely mortified. I immediately confronted my sister about it, getting a strong sixth sense that she was the most likely culprit, and she thought it was fucking hilarious. She literally laughed until she cried while I was standing there nearly crying from stress and mortification.\n\nMy sister has always been a joker and she gets away with bloody murder, but this was so serious. I am sick of her pulling off this shite to everyone around her, thinking it's funny or cool or something. It was only when I explained to her the full seriousness of the situation, and that I had sent it to 20/30 places, that she copped on and apologized. Not sure if she was being genuine but the words \"I'm sorry\" definitely left her mouth.\n\nThen she had the audacity to blame me for it, asking me why I hadn't checked it before sending it off. I screamed at her that I had checked it multiple times before leaving to get tea, and didn't expect anyone else to change it while I was gone. She then back-pedaled and insisted that she meant it as a joke, like \"just a prank brah\" mentality but I'm having none of it.\n\nI don't know what the hell to do now and rectify the situation. I have never job hunted before, I don't know how serious this stupid mistake is. I live in a large enough Irish town but small enough for businesses to spread gossip, so I'm terrified that they'll all now know not to hire the \"garlic bread\" girl. Should I email the places I applied to explaining the situation, or will I sound like a complete knob?\n\nTechnically, it IS true that garlic bread is a passion of mine simply because it's delicious, but obviously it is not resum\u00e9-worthy. The businesses probably think I'm taking the piss and it's extremely unprofessional. I'm so annoyed that this is my first impression in the working world, I'm not even hired and I've fucked up already. Should I resend them my application with my resum\u00e9 fixed? Should I move on and forget about the places I applied and apply to new businesses with a rectified resum\u00e9? Should I just fucking move town at this point since I've clearly made a fool of myself already? Also, how do I talk to my parents or sister about her stupid spoilt bratty behavior?\n\n\n   \nTL;DR: My little sister changed my hobbies and passions section on my resum\u00e9 to \"garlic bread\" as a joke and I sent it out to about 20/30 business in my town unknowingly. I have no idea how to fix this.",

            "Hiring manager here. Considering you're 18 and applying for (assuming) retail, fast food, customer service type of jobs - no one is going to disqualify you for the garlic bread. If anything, it may have the opposite effect. Maybe it'll make someone laugh and intrigue them enough to schedule you for an interview despite your lack of experience.   \n\nHiring managers look at dozens upon dozens of resumes a day. A professional resume is great...but chances are it's generic and something we've already seen a thousand times. Uninteresting. (Again, speaking given your age and lack of experience).   \n\n\nDon't bother emailing an apology (it won't matter). Ride it out. You'll most likely get a call back for adding humour onto your resume while the 100 other resumes all read the same.  ",
            "Only give your sister garlic bread for Christmas and birthdays (it is your passion after all) until she makes it up to you.",
            "This is a good lesson for both of you with a very light penalty. \n\nAt 18, the jobs you would potentially be getting are not going to have a long term consequence. \n\nThe lesson for you:\n\nMake sure to *always* check your resume before sending it in for a job. \n\nWhen I was applying for career positions, I applied to 100+ jobs, and I checked my resume rigorously every time. Also, make sure you *tailor* your resume to the job at hand, don't just send in the same one for every job. \n\nFor your sister:\n\nYou need to talk with your folks and your sister about what things are acceptable to mess with, and what aren't.  \n\nShe is grown enough to know at this point that you don't play a prank with things such as jobs. This is a lesson she needs to learn now, rather than later.\n\nOne of my friends from college had this experience with his girlfriend. As a \"prank\" she put in his resume that he was part of a well known American hate group. \n\nHe lost a chance to interview for a position at a prestigious organization he had been recommended for because of that, and it changed his career path.

            "> I don't know how serious this stupid mistake is.\n\nAt 18 years old looking for a summer job, not very.  I know you're frustrated, but other commenters here have given you excellent advice as to how to proceed.  \n\nHonestly it is pretty funny.  I promise you will look back and understand that in the grand scheme of things, it's not a big deal...you may even laugh about it (maybe).",
            "*Technically, it IS true that garlic bread is a passion of mine simply because it's delicious, but obviously it is not resum\u00e9-worthy.*    I don't really think any \"passions and hobbies\" are resume worthy so \"garlic bread\" is about as good as \"reading, acting, volunteer work.\"  I think if I, as a personnel officer, saw garlic bread as a hobby on an 18 year old's resume, I might be curious but not condemning nor would I reject the applicant for the peculiar hobby.",

            "Fortunately the hobbies and passions section is the least important part of the resume.  It's embarrassing, but a lot of people might not notice, especially if the rest of your resume is solid.  It's not goofy enough that anybody is going to gossip about it, probably, so even if she's shot your chances at some of those jobs (which, unfortunately, is not impossible) those managers aren't going to spread the word to anybody else.  It's not interesting enough.  \n\nI wouldn't bother reapplying with a fixed resume, it might just draw attention to the original mistake if they didn't notice.  If they did notice, you'll still look inattentive and sloppy, so it's not worth it IMO. \n\nHowever, in my opinion fucking with somebody's job applications is serious fucking business and your sister ought to get that lesson from this.  She absolutely intended for you to not notice -- I can't see why else she'd save and close the file like nothing happened.  Password protect your computer. Don't accept her shitty half-apologies.  Tell your parents. If they don't take her \"pranks\" seriously, there's not a lot you can do, but if it were me I'd be frosty with her for a really long time. ",

Among her technical skills were nestled creative and chuckle-worthy entries such as \"Dress Myself\". Now, this was for a design position, so I appreciated the humor immensely and loved that she set herself apart from the competition. There's a chance you could encounter a similar situation with a local hiring manager. Take it in stride this time, and don't be afraid to make light of it. \n\nBut definitely lock your computer or check all important files next time! Good luck!",

I think the absurdity of having \"garlic bread\" as your singular interest is potentially intriguing. And even if that comes across as a negative, the message of \"sorry for sending out my resume without quadruple checking it\" would come across much worse.\n\nAnd, look, you haven't ruined anything. It's not like every business in a thirty mile radius will hang your photo up on the wall in HR saying \"Don't hire this woman - cares too much about garlic bread.\" Most won't even see it. Most who do will chuckle. The few who think it's unprofessional won't remember your name next week.",

            "I'm a hiring manager in the UK and have done recruitment for a bar/nightclub in a previous job. This would probably intrigue me to invite you to interview, so long as the rest of your CV matched the requirements. \n\nAnyway, here's my advice: Own it! Spend a bit of time online doing some garlic bread based research and try some different breads from local shops/restaurants and write a blog or something about them (it doesn't have to be anything major). That way, you either get someone who's interested and you will be able to show an above average knowledge of garlic bread or you won't be asked at all and they won't care. The important thing is that your prepared if the question does get asked. You will look worse if you can't offer a few facts about garlic bread. Also, it's a good opportunity to make a lighthearted joke about teeth brushing or vampires. Interviewing is not just about experience/knowledge, it's about getting to see someone's personality and if they are going to be a good fit for the company. A sense of humour is a very important trait. \n\nAt 18 and fresh out of school, you won't be going for any job that would look down on you for this (at anywhere you would want to work), your sister might actually have helped you stand out from the crowd too. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't email all the companies saying it was an error because your sister (despite her faults) is right about checking things before sending them. \n\nAnother piece of advice is to export your CV as a pdf, which looks more professional and is not as easy for pesky siblings to edit! You can easily do this on Word by hitting 'Save As' and then choosing pdf under the 'Save as type' drop down box.\n\nRegarding your sister, have a heart to heart with her about privacy and boundaries. It is important to explain that you understand it is a joke, but she has put you through a lot of stress and possibly made your life more difficult as a result. End with a sisterly hug and then tell her she owes you some garlic bread as 'punishment'. You can even look up a recipe and make some together for some bonding. ",
            "One advice is that, ALWAYS send your CV in PDF format. Never in word format.

The advice thrown at you about being professional, using action verbs, having a synopsis, etc... that is all very generic advice. The stuff that will not offend the largest group of people.

It sounds like you're looking for entry level jobs and recruiters for these might still give a little leeway, but that's being optimistic and is fairly unlikely. The main thing to donis what you already know: learn to lock your laptop even if you only leave it for a second just in case your kid sister tries to mess about with it again.

I know it sounds silly, but you need to own everything you put in a CV and be ready to talk about any of it in more detail if asked. This is an important point whether you're talking about garlic bread or have included something as filler because sometimes what gets you the interview when your CV is basically the same as all the other applicants is that yours includes that one thing that you have in common with the interviewer. Maybe they love garlic bread too and feel 1% more connection to you than to the other 200 candidates. Don't then show up knowing nothing about the dish.\n\n\nOverall, put this down to experience, let go of the mortification, forgive your sister and move on. Good luck, Garlic Bread Girl.

Most people would look at a section that isn't really that important and say \"ha!  good one, mmm garlic bread\"  \n\nSo maybe it's just me but I think in some cases this could actually help you, depending on what used to be under Hobbies & Passions.  After your skills and experience have been analyzed, and there's 5 positions but 50 applicants, prospective employers usually look for signs that you'd be a good fit on the team, in terms of personality.  And maybe it's just me, but someone putting down \"garlic bread\" under \"Hobbies & Passions\", depending on what the rest of the resume is like, is someone who takes the job seriously, but knows when to take it down a notch and relax.\n\nIt could go either way, really.

I thought I should share what happened after the post to u guys since I got so many helping replies.\n\nSo first of all one thing I realised was that I never thought that he might not like what I like in bed. I believed he was also enjoying as much and never properly talked to him about it.\n\nAnd then me and my husband had a long conversation about the issue. At first he was like there is no issues at all. So I asked him what part of our intimacy did he like the most. He told me he liked undressing me and seeing me naked the most and then after sex cuddling as second. So basically the specific PiV part was not liked. I asked him if he has any specific thing he wanted to introduce. He didn't have anything perticular in mind so I asked him to look it up with me. We read some online stuff about different kinks. He showed interest towards blindfolds and handcuffs. So we bought it.\n\nThe next night we decided to try it out. He handcuffed and blindfolded me. Halfway through, he suddenly opens my blindfolds and tells me that it was even worse than before. So I thought it was a failure.\n\nYesterday night, I was thinking about some other stuff we can do when he came to me with the handcuffs. But this time... He wanted me to use it on him instead. At first I was like wtf?? But I decided why not it won't hurt to try. So I handcuffed him, took the lead. And for me... I enjoyed the fuck out of it. His reactions were amazing to watch. I did fumble a few times but we reached the end. He also told me this was hugely better. So.... Yeah looks like he was a submissive type. I myself am not a pure dom but I liked to take to lead too. \n\nAnd I also asked him that he told me at first that he liked seeing me naked so how is he also liking being blindfolded? He said that he did like to see me but the fact that he wasn't able to turned him on. Can anyone explain this to me? \n\nOtherwise reading ur replies was a big big help. So thank u to all of u. I would also be happy to say he is not asexual or has someone else. \n\nTldr: husband turned out of be a sub.",

It's the fact he wants to see you but can't or isn't \"allowed\" to. This fact basically underlines that he isn't in charge or that it isn't about \"what he wants\", if that makes sense.",

Can anyone explain this to me?\n\nTaking away his sense of sight may allow him to focus more on the sensation of touch or internal sensations of pleasure.  When you're wearing a blindfold, you also enter the mind's eye, which is a unique way of experiencing intimacy (akin to why you close your eyes when you kiss).",

            "All I can say is that it's definitely a thing that happens.. I love my partner but it seems that I just tend to respond to arousing stimulus better without the visual there. It's not that they're unattractive to me or anything but I feel I focus a lot better on what they're saying/doing without the ability to focus on what I see.\n\n(Granted I am also grey ace so my sexual experience is a little different)\n\nEdited to add: I am also a submissive, and there's both an element of giving up my vision as part of the submission (not being allowed to see) as well as just the ability to focus more on other things. So it's possibly either or both in his case, or something else!",
            "I\u2019m going to offer and alternative for you to consider.\n\nIt could be that you are too passive previously, and that he needed you to feel more excitement or to want it and do more about it instead of just saying you want it. It\u2019s a psychological thing where he doesn\u2019t feel that you\u2019re being passive about it.\n\nNow why did I bring this up even though a lot of people have come to the conclusion he is submissive? Because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that straightforward, and it might be extra information for you to think about.",
            "He likes seeing you naked because well naked is awesome.  And he likes the blindfold because you don't know what is going to happen next.  It's the excitement of the unknown.",
            "Do you have a lot of experience with sex? Like before him with other partners? \n\nLike I'm your age, but I've been with my partner for like 6 years and he was the third guy I ever slept with. I didn't realise it but after a while we communicated and short story short, I kinda \"suck\" at sex and am very vanilla and inexperienced. Like I'm not bad, I do the normal stuff like blow jobs, riding and stuff, but didn't generally realise I should be putting in more effort. And it wasn't a super complaint from him because he could still get off, it just could be better. We got a whole buncha sex toys, even bought an advents calendar of sex toys for xmas where we could try one new toy per day (hit and miss on them, not everything is our thing) and tried new positions, massages before getting intimate, handcuffs and blind folds etc, talking dirty. Plus I looked at porn and learned a bit from there. (Disclaimer! Porn isn't exactly real real, so wouldn't say you copy is 100%, but it's good for getting inspiration). Even he likes the submissive stuff, which generally involves a LOT of teasing before penetration. It makes him feel sexy/wanted. \n\nLike it's soooo easy for women to be fooled by the media and think guys just wanna fuck period. But guys need loving and effort too. Sex alone isn't enough.",
            "In terms of him liking not being able to see, maybe it allows his imagination to take over. Or maybe it heightens his other senses and that\u2019s new and exciting for him. As long as you guys are both enjoying it, keep having fun.",
            "I can't explain how thoroughly my sex life changed when I started bottoming. I was always a bottom trying to top and sex was unfulfilling. Turns out, I just like getting railed. Congrats to you both!",
            "If he has a submissive side that wasn't getting seen, then it makes total sense that he wouldn't be as interested in PIV.\n\nMaybe he'd enjoy PIV while in a more submissive role? Rolling with the submissiveness might be a way for both of your needs to be met.\n\nI have a submissive streak, and find being \"in charge\" during sex kind of stressful, especially while penetrating. I would probably find it really hot to be dominated during PIV. There's something about your partner doing it *to you* for their own pleasure that makes it completely different. Maybe see if he would enjoy being restrained and / or blindfolded while you ride him.\n\nGood luck!",

            "I had some familiar giggles reading this update. My husband insisted for MONTHS that he was the dominant type but whenever we tried to have specifically kinky sex with him in the lead, it would flop. I was honestly concerned he might even have ED because he insisted I was the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever seen. The first time I tied that man up, it was the best sex we\u2019ve ever had.

I mean .. she did .... when I said \"I am about to cum\".     She even was the opinion this is great sex - and I wondered what was missing for far too long tbh.",

Let his imagination do some of the work.",
            "I think I can probably be of some help here. I was in a similar situation with my wife, after several years of marriage, sex wasn't as fun as it used to be for me. \n\nLike your husband, I liked the foreplay, and everything around the sex, but the actual sex act itself was kind of like \"Meh, I mean it feels good, but it's just not FUN\".\n\nI don't want to pry, but my wife is someone who can't orgasm from vaginal sex, so all of her orgasms are from oral or vibrators, and I always make sure she gets hers before me, so by the time it was \"my turn\", it almost felt robotic, and a little selfish. She never made it feel that way, or said anything to hint that she felt that way, those feelings were all from me.\n\nI felt like the actual sex part was just something I did because my body wanted/needed the orgasm. It wasn't an emotional bonding experience like it used to be. \n\nIn any case, long story short, it turned out that I am also a HUGE sub, and leaning into that life has made our sex life AWESOME for both of us. \n\nNow, your husband may not be as submissive as I am, and/or you may not be as dominant as my wife turned out to be, but here's some things that I think might help: \n\nRegarding the blindfold, why does your husband say that he likes seeing you naked but also likes being blindfolded? Because that's just part of the submissive mind. We like having our desires used against us, and being denied things that we want by those who are domming us. \n\nSomething simple to try is, one time you have sex, tell him right at the beginning that he's not allowed to orgasm until you say so, and then the first few times he asks for permission, tell him no. Make him beg for it a bit before you give in. \n\nIf he loves that, do it more, and then one day, when he's really desperate, tell him \"No, not tonight. Maybe tomorrow.\" And then let him stew until the next time. If he's anything like me, that will drive him WILD, and he will be very eager to please you next time. \n\nIf you two really get into that life and it's working for you, continue to look online for other ideas, but some of the common kinks for submissive men are; orgasm denial, being spanked, and edging. \n\nFor your own sake, I would also suggest being honest with yourself and your husband about how dominant you want to be, and how much you enjoy that role. Because if it's something he wants it likes, he's going to want it more, and it you don't enjoy it too, you'll end up in the reverse situation, where now you're not having fun. \n\nFind a good balance where you can hopefully both indulge your kinks. \n\nFinally, if there is a kink that you have, even if your husband  isn't into it, he might enjoy you indulging yourself, just because it makes him feel submissive to know that you're doing something just because you enjoy it. \n\nI hope some of that was helpful, feel free to ask anything else, if you like.",

Jokingly, his friends were saying we were going up there to fuck (I live above the bar). We did a tiny bit of coke while we were up there, hung out and played games and talked about the PC for like maybe an hour and a half or so, then he went back down and I stayed up there. \n\nWhile he was down there, I dont know what got into him, but he must have told his friends some story that ended with us having sex. Or its possible one of his friends just thought that? I have no idea, he was really coked up when he left downstairs so I assume it was him who told the story. \n\nthe next day I awoke to a whole lot of people messaging me saying that they heard me and george (the guy) had sex and that they had no idea I was gay and they wanted to congratulate me and all that. I am not sure HOW this spread so fast, but 4 people hit me up. Apparently the rumor developed into not only did I have sex with him, but I also came out to him as gay? \n\nEither way, I wrote a FB status right there and then seeking to end this tirade, saying it didnt happen, me and george didnt do anything, its just some weird lie or rumor. A person (a gay man specifically) wrote that he didnt think george would lie about that and that he is disappointed that I felt so embarrassed to come out as gay that I would deny it after, or to accuse a gay man of lying just to protect my masculinity. that comment got 6 likes, and a few people responded saying they agree, that it came off like I was denying it to protect my masculinity, and that they believe george over me. Another girl wrote as her status \"when straight guys call a gay man a liar about them having sex just to protect his masculinity\" and it was kind of obvious she was referring to me. \n\nI dont even know what to say. For one, I hit up george, I called him, its been 4 days, zero response. I am not even sure if I have the right phone number.

I've told every single one, sorry, its just a rumor, some of them were like 'oh okay sorry'  and some didnt even respond, presumably because they saw my status and that guy who commented on it. \n\nI don't know what to do. I dont give a shit if I was gay, but I don't want to be known as gay when I am not. Its just a weird feeling because people have accused me now of homophobia over this and I just feel terrible because I have no bad feelings towards gay people, but I just want people to know, I am not gay. Like, this isn't true, at all. But now everytime I deny it it just looks worse. One of my friends hit me up and she said \"look, I know you are denying it, but on the chance you are gay and just feel embarrassed thats okay too!\" and it just made me realize I may never be able to shake this off\n\nWhat the hell do I do? I barely even know this george guy, he might never respond! \n\nEdit: In the title I said 'refuses to tell the truth', really its more like he isnt responding at all \n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Being accused of sleeping with a dude, I am not gay.

            ">A person (a gay man specifically) wrote that he didnt think george would lie about that and that he is disappointed that I felt so embarrassed to come out as gay that I would deny it after, or to accuse a gay man of lying just to protect my masculinity. that comment got 6 likes, and a few people responded saying they agree, that it came off like I was denying it to protect my masculinity, and that they believe george over me. \n\nThat comment right there proves George has spread the lie or that, at least, he's letting it go on.\n\nForeword: I understand that I may have all of this wrong. What follows is conjecture, coming from OP's words. \n\nIt's very simple, really. George was hitting on you. His friends knew he was hitting on you (that's why they made the comment), and when they saw you go up with him they thought it had happened. Of course, it didn't work because you're not gay. But when he came back the story was on its tracks already and George went with it, and now won't admit that it didn't happen because he has a reputation to maintain. George is an asshole and a coward, basically; his friends are the kind of delusional, insufferable crowd who made lgbt identity a clique and thrive on celebrating a vague idea of gayness because they're too vapid to have interesting personalities of their own.\n\nHonestly his lie is very easy to dismantle. If you want, you can just have people confirm with him something about your body that he could only know by seeing you naked, or something. \n\nI wouldn't bother, though. I wouldn't feed it anymore. I agree with other users that the best course of action is to just tell these people to fuck off with their allegations. You can't prove that you're \"not gay\", and accusing you of homophobia is out of line. My normal strategy with people who try to twist my words into their own comfortable narrative is to very clearly take offense, shut it down and end the conversation. \n\nI would post something like \"I don't know or care why George is making these claims, I only know that they are false, and any idiot should understand that I can't prove that something didn't happen. But I take it as a personal offense that you would assume that I'm doing this on purpose, so I will not entertain this pointless argument any further. Believe whatever you want, but don't talk to me again.\" The point is making it about the story. Don't engage with the homophobia acusation, because that's a trap that you can't get out of: if you say \"I'm not gay\", you're in the closet; if you say \"I'm not homophobic\", that's what a homophobe would say, etc. These people thrive on finding a good scapegoat for their political narrative. Stick to the fact that his story is false. If someone asks you \"but are you gay?\", don't even go there, to be honest. \"My sexuality isn't important here. What's important is that this guy has made up a story.\" Don't deny or accept, don't adress homosexuality at all, because that's not relevant, in my opinion. The story is false. That's what matters.\n\nThen, just block these people. Alternatively, you can block without saying anything. ",

If you say anything else at all I would just be like \"Hello to all. I'm not gay, and even if I were I'd still be blocking you all because you're a gay person's worst nightmare. Say I was in the closet and I did hook up with him. He just freaking told all of you my private matters and you all have the gall to shame me for being upset about it.

You might even try sending him a message telling him that you're not pissed at him, but you want to know what happened. Or just let it go, since you don't know him.",
            "Kind of had the same thing happen to me in high school. Had a gay friend who turned out to be \"in love\" with me and told some people we were secretly together or something and I got stuck in the same predicament that you're in now. I had a girlfriend and was comfortable about my sexuality so I didn't take offense to people thinking I was gay, so I just didn't get hung up on it and I didn't address it. I stopped hanging out with that dude because he was obviously manipulative and a liar, and just went about life as normal. People didn't really know what to think of me so I guess that made me somewhat interesting and whenever I was asked about everything I just told the truth. \n\nBut don't be making announcements on Facebook or wherever and don't get angry about the situation. I admit, if I saw someone getting super worked up about that I would suspect they were lying too but obviously I would be in the wrong. Just try to go about things as you normally would and if people try to antagonize you about it, get rid of them because their behavior would feel so much worse to you if you actually were gay. Lots of people will be showing you their true colors, take them at their word.",
            "Hey. I'm gay. And I'm sorry you are in this situation. It sucks. No nicer way of putting it.\n\n\nMy advice is to make another post reiterating that you are not gay. And while your friends may be well meaning, coming out is a private decision*. A gay person outing another doesn't give everyone permission to assume they understand another person's sexuality. If they really want to be supportive they need to take your word for it and end the discussion right now.\n\nThis may sound like an admission to some, but your friends need to understand that they are in the wrong here ",
            "I posted this as a comment to another reply, but I want to also post it as a main level comment to ensure that OP sees it.\n\nAs a gay man, I can tell you that calling out the hypocrisy of these folks will work in terms of helping get through to them.\n\n\"I'm disappointed at the comments that I've received to my prior post here. Those of you who are trying to shame me for standing up against being \"outed\" against my will are missing the point. They should recognize what a violation it is to try and forcibly out a gay man against his wishes. If I am gay, I'm clearly one who isn't comfortable with being out. That's a completely valid choice for a gay person to make. While I do not understand why, I can say for certain that George is lying about having slept with me. This is the last time I'm going to address things here.\"\n\nThat would make an impression on people. If it doesn't, well...they aren't particularly good friends to have.\n\nEdit: For the record, I'm absolutely suggesting you not claim your orientation. That's completely beside the point. Just call them out for their bad behavior and then deny having slept with George. Nothing else.",
            "My friend is trans. For the longest time she denied being any type of LGBTQIA+. I respected it because I firmly believed you know best your own orientation. A lot of people did not and were not only harassing her to just \"come out\" and \"everyone knows that he is a gay dude so what's the big deal\" but also, I and a few other close friends of hers were being told to force her out and chewed out when we refused, yelled at and some even shunned us for sticking up to a friend. When she did come out as a transwoman not a gay man, only one person apologised to her and no one ever apologised to me or the other friends for how people, all LGBTQIA+ people by the way, treated us before she came out. It's ridicolous. People get so worked up about being out and proud that they forget that not everyone wants to be out or that if they come out it might not be that they come out as gay.",
            "Yeah, it is actually considered poor etiquette to \"out\" people unwillingly.

If you want to edit your status by deleting or disabling comments under it, or by just removing the status entirely, that could work well, too.\n\nThere is no need to go shouting in the town square about not being gay. Just calmly say, \"I'm not gay\" and if others refer to that night, you can say, \"We played games and talked about the PC [or whatever it was], then he left.

I don't know and I honestly don't care. That's his problem to sort out with his therapist.\n\nWhat really pissed me off though, was that a lot of people believed him.

You should consider hiring a publicist because you are out classed here. /s\n\nI can get why this is frustrating because as you said: nothing wrong with being gay, you just ain't gay. Unfortunately just saying you're not gay is not cutting it. Blasting messages like that out is for people that are too embarrassed to address people in person. (People are going to call me an angry old bastard for that I suppose)\n\nHere's what you do to fix things:\n\n1. You probably need new friends: George seems like he either started this or is letting it ride. Fuck George. No more sweet computer games for George. Also, definitely no sex with George. You should probably not engage with George in social settings anymore... People will probably be understanding of avoiding George in light of part 2.\n\n2. Flip the fucking script: Respond to the core group of people that were there that night and are likely your ground zero crowd for spreading the rumors. You send them this message:\n\n>(Person's name), I have been really upset and hurt by everything that has gone on. I am devastated that so many people want to broadcast intimate details they have heard about me. It feels really invasive and I just don't know how to handle all this public humiliation. I can tell you one thing with 100% certainty: I have never and will never consent to having sex with George. I suggest you consider asking George what really happened that night and I hope you can see fit to giving me a reasonable level of privacy as you would grant any other friend.\n\n**BOOM** and now you're playing chess brother.\n\n3. Address the spread to the best of your ability: For anyone coming to you to congratulate your coming out, you respond with this:\n\n>(Person's name), I am a little baffled by all the people that have talked to me about coming out. I am not sure who has spread this rumor to you, but I can assure you completely that I have not come out to anyone. Any person that may have told you that is completely mistaken. This may have started with some rumors by (ground zero crowd). I am not sure if they thought that was some sort of joke but I can assure you I have not come out to anyone. Thank you so much for understanding.\n\n4. Close the loop: Hopefully step 2 will yeild a quick retraction, but if not now we come back to address George. If George has not recanted at this point, I would recommend you send via certified letter, this:\n\n>George, I have really been struggling with all that has transpired in the last weeks. My head is still reeling and I am not sure what to make of this. There are numerous people saying that we had sex the night we went up to my place to look at my computer and game. This terrifies me because I have no recollection of that occurring and can say with confidence that while I have appreciated our friendship in the past, there is no way that I consented to having sex with you. I need a written and signed response as to your recollection of what transpired that evening in the next week. If we did have sex you and I need to discuss this because it was certainly not consensual. If I do not receive a written and signed response from you in the week allotted I will have to report the assault to the police and have them take statements from everyone that has given accounts of a sexual encounter between us. I am very saddened by the need to send this letter but I feel I have no other options as you have actively avoided my attempts to speak with you to clear up this matter.\n\nBefore any of this I would highly recommend you remove any illicit items from your home as if you have to go to the police they may need to come take a statement. Please be 100% honest with the police about the pertinent details of this issue.",

            "My thoughts are lying about sleeping with someone is really scummy, and a bit weird. But the thing I would have an issue with here is being \u2018outed\u2019 (no idea if that\u2019s an appropriate term, anyone feel free to put me right) against your will if you did happen to be gay... from what I understand coming out is a huge deal and George would be pulling a major violation of trust, even for a friend forget a potential partner... IF he did start these rumours, because that\u2019s all they are at this point, you need to stay clear of him because god only know what else he will make up, liars will never fail to amaze with the nonsense they can concoct. You might end up in jail or worse if you\u2019ve somehow \u2018offended\u2019 George in this little scenario he made up in his head. Then you need to hope that your circle of friends knows you well enough to know that you mean no offence or homophobia, but you certainly are not gay but if you were shouldn\u2019t that information come from you and not second hand from old George?

            "I think most of the commenters so far have a lot of great suggestions for how to handle this, OP. \nMy .02 is to think about how it feels to have this happen once to you and realize that it happens to gay people all the time. When I was a teen I was out as a lesbian, yet somehow almost everyone assumed I was straight. If I went (like you did) up to some guy's room to chat for a minute and do some coke (something I did often as a teen, lol) people usually assumed we had sex. I had to just deal with that fact. Since other guys saw that I seemed to be having sex all the time with guys who were actually just my friends they decided it was okay not to believe that I was lesbian and hit on me hoping for sex-ALL the time. It's actually the main reason I cut my hair super short now, so guys won't assume I'm straight. Anyway, the whole people thinking you're some sexuality that you're not--yeh, it's not fun, but it also doesn't matter what they think. The only people who matter in regards to your sexuality is the girls that you'd like to date. Ignore the people who think you are gay now or some bullshit. You don't really even need to deny it because it only matters in that having dudes hit on you all the time is annoying. If that happens, I'm sorry OP. :/",

Some girl started it as revenge for something she thought I did.  Anyways I just ignored it or laughed it off if anyone asked or said anything.  After a while of me bringing girls around and, ya know, not being gay, the rumor just went away.  Took a couple years though probably.  I literally gave zero fucks the whole time, it was just funny to me.  ",
            "In middle school I got in trouble for kissing my best friend on the lips. It was very public and the rumors spread like crazy! My friend actually talked to a younger relative attending that school and [my name]+[her name] with a heart around it is still carved into the wood into the wall of the science room. My friend has a very unusual name so her family member noticed it. We never could shake the lesbian thing after that. I also have always had short hair and used to be flat chested and dress boyish and hung out with boys setting stuff on fire so to outsiders it looked legit. In high school a girl that was a lesbian and knew some of the lesbians at my school saw me at the bus stop in my uniform rocking a freshly shaved head and started asking around about me wanting to date me. So since I had a shaved head+ was obviously friendly with and talking to the known lesbians at the all girl high school it just picked up and continued on. It never did help I was a tomboy but I wasn't going to change my style. I liked who I was and never really denied it too hard because from the beginning I realized that this is a thing where the more you deny and seem like you care the more you convince people of what they want to think.\n\nI now have been working as a cook in restaurants for years and also when I was younger worked at a wood mill as well as some other male dominated places. I can drive a fork lift, I'm very petite but strong physically and people are surprised by my self reliance at work some times because I don't just let the guys carry all my heavy stuff. I don't have shit to prove I'm just trying to be a good co worker! Well even though those rumors are long dead I can still tell that when people meet me when I start a new job they can't tell if I'm gay or not and are trying to figure it out. \n\nJust roll with it it's not like girls hate talking to gay dudes and the people who you are going to bang will believe the mix up. I wouldn't fight it too much though because in my experience that did the opposite. Now when people figure out that I most def have sex with men they'll sometimes be surprised and certainly every lesbian I have worked with was not sure at first and trying to figure me out. \n\nIt's so weird to me because I'm much more girly now than back then and I don't feel like I look butch or anything but there is something about my personality and life experience that tells people I might be gay. It's been going on more than half my life now and I don't really care anymore I don't try to help people figure it out even because they always eventually come to their own conclusions and I have a good sex life so fuck it!

Thanks again.\n\n\n\nRelationship: off/on for about 2 years.\n\nI\u2019ve been working from home for a while (freelance) so that I can take classes I need as prereqs for a graduate program. It\u2019s been taking like... years (3?) but I\u2019ve also been working. I finally took on freelancing/working from home so i could take certain classes that typically conflicted w normal work hours. It\u2019s great. It also has created a less predictable sleep/work day. \n\nRecently my bf also got a new job which pays better and also requires more hours out of him. He used to wake at like... 10am-11 and leave work around 5 with a flexible schedule. Now he gets up at 6/7 to get to work at 8am.\n\nThis is a bit of background to explain my interpretation of bf\u2019s behavior. \n\nMy bf started saying \u201cI have a job\u201d as a response to things, questions, comments. Things like \u201cYou should stay over at my place\u201d or \u201cAre you going to bed?\u201d or especially \u201cAre you going to the bar tonight?\u201d even, which he does every single night and drinks with whoever there. I used to think this kind of response was just directed at me due to my working from home and working to start a new career. And yes, I find it insulting.\n\nJust last night we were at a friend\u2019s house gathering, sitting around the fire drinking, and he kept saying he wanted to leave (yet filled a cup full of wine for the Uber ride home), so we started to get up to go. A friend made a comment like \u201cawww you\u2019re leaving! I wish you\u2019d stay!\u201d Or something similar. \n\nHis immediate response: \u201cI have a job!\u201d ... almost like an incredulous response. \n\nThis friend had a brief moment of confusion and said, smiling, said I have a job too!\u201d. My bf just kept going, saying \u201cI have to be there at 8!\u201d And she again responded \u201cI have to be at my job at 8am too!\u201d and having this look on her face like... thinking this was funny in a way? Like she\u2019s in grad school and working and hearing him say this to her. Like, man you\u2019re talking to a bunch of 30 year olds not some fresh college grads. \n\nI tried to tell him that it doesn\u2019t make sense for him to keep saying that to people... like who here doesn\u2019t have a job? That it sounds condescending and it doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nHe just gets offended and pissed and shuts down. I don\u2019t know how else to explain it to him. Help?\n\n**tl;dr bf keeps saying \u201ci have a job\u201d as a response to  people\u2019s comments which is weird and condescending, and he gets offended when I try to tell him this. Don\u2019t know how to proceed**",

            "It sounds to me like he might just be upset/jealous that his new hours are cutting into his drinking/fun hours.",
            "My bigger question is that he goes to the bar every night. Every night?! I thought only husbands in sitcoms did that.",
            "It looks like there are two issues here: his punctuality, and the way he communicates. You said in the comments that he used to not care about being punctual at his previous job. Now he does. It's likely that this is stressing him out and taking up a lot of energy, and he might be worried about slipping and getting written up or fired for being tardy. The pressure/invitations to stay out late are clearly getting to him, because under normal circumstances, he'd love to do so.\n\nLet me make this clear, though: *this does not make it okay for him to snap at other people.* I struggle with chronic lateness, and it takes a lot of planning for me to be on time. But it's never okay for me to take that out on other people who have no issues staying out late and getting up early.\n\nMoving on, here are some things you can say in the moment:\n\n\"\\[Calmly\\] I know you have a job. That doesn't answer my question.\"\n\n\"If you don't want to stay over at my place, I need you to say those exact words. You're my boyfriend and I want to spend time with you. I am also willing to help you get out the door on time if that's an issue.\"\n\n\"What time do you want to leave after trivia?\"\n\n\"I know being on time is important to you and you're working hard to change your habits. I need you to stop taking your stress out on me and our friends. All you need to do is tell us what you need.\"\n\n**EDITED TO ADD:**\n\nAlso, he has a habit of drinking until 1-2am (and drinking more after he's left the bar)? You said in your edit that it's a different conversation, but this new schedule also affects his drinking habits. This post might fall under the umbrella of, \"How does my boyfriend's relationship with drinking affect the way he treats me, and our relationship overall?\"",
            "Hi, I was a functioning alcoholic until I wasn\u2019t. You\u2019re boyfriends behavior sounds really familiar to me. At the end, before I got help, things got really bad. I wanted to drink at home alone - a bar alone works too- where I could drink as much as I wanted to without anyone caring or noticing. \n\nGatherings where people weren\u2019t drinking as fast as me, or where there was just a bottle or 2 of wine for everyone made me really antsy. I just wanted to get home where I had my own supply of booze.\n\nSo he says he wants to leave - he may be already agitated at moderating his drinking all night. And when people say, \u201chey stay longer\u201d he says, \u201cI have a job.\u201d It\u2019s a legitimate excuse to go home. A responsible one. Does he go to bed right when he gets home from these events or does he stay up and drink?\n\nI could be reading this entirely wrong. I just speak from my own experience. I hope I\u2019m wrong. But I got a weird familiar feeling when I was reading this.\n\nThe slide from functioning to non-functioning can go incredibly fast. Take care of yourself, OP.",

            "Honestly, sounds like your bf is salty he has to get up in the morning and work a full 8 hrs (10-5 is only 6). He needs to stop being an ass and this might justify a conversation about his attitude about it or, the next time he gets all \"I have a job\" someone should say something like \"we all have jobs and none of us appreciate you implying we don't with your attitude.\" Or \"and we don't? So and so was only expressing that they enjoy your company, but we not any more so have a good night\" or just \"wow, that was unnecessary\". Return his awkward \"I have a job\" right back at him.\n\nSometimes people don't get what dumb thing they're saying is implying to others and need it spelled out that they're being jerks.",
            "Honestly I think, when things like this come up, people just have to accept that the other person is doing it on purpose. Yes, he said it to be condescending. That's why he tried to back it up with \"well *I* have to be there at 8\" and he just doesn't like hearing feedback about it because he doesn't want to change and that's it.",

            "I'm more interested in this part:\n\n> He just gets offended and pissed and shuts down. I don\u2019t know how else to explain it to him.  \n\nIf he's not receptive to you talking to him about it, you might be at a standstill, especially since the usual prescription for relationship issues is communication. Failing that, the best option I can come up with would be to decide on a consistent, bottled response that you use for this, especially when he says it *instead* of actually answering your question. Eg, \"Are you going to bed?\" \"I have a job!\" \"Okay, so do I. So are you going to bed or what?\" When he inevitably gets frustrated by one of these interactions, explain that you are actually aware he has a job, but that doesn't always mean he isn't staying over/is going to bed/isn't going to the bar, and it'd be more helpful if he were honest with you when he doesn't want to do something instead of deflecting it this way.\n\nIdeally you would also address the fact that he seems to think freelance + school is less legit than a 9-5, but you might need to tackle that separately if he's not down to communicate about it.",

I'm keeping it together and showing up to work. \n \nI doubt he has any intention of being rude. He's scared to death, and those words are his talisman that everything is still ok.",

He may have a job, but it likely won't last.

            "Your boyfriend reminds me of my step-dad. He sounds insecure and bitter about his lot in life and unable to adjust to the new lifestyle his new job demands, so he's just taking it out on others and pretentiously playing the martyr at the same time for the ego boost. \n\nThe drinking is only going to make this type of behavior spiral. Staying out every night drinking past 11 when you get up at 7 is practically the definition of alcoholism. He won't ever mature out of his resentfulness and learn to appreciate life with a drinking schedule like that.",
            "Buy a sheet of gold star stickers and next time he says that bust out a sticker for him, saying \"Wow! Good job!\". Then give one to everyone else who has one as well. \"Oh you do too? Wow!\"\nJk that might not go over well but it's super tempting.",

Its an indication that we\u2019re all grown ups now.",
            "This might be off base, but it sounds like he has been a very immature person for a long time. He never had to wake up early for his last job and he has been a functional alcoholic for a long time. I get the sense that these two things combined are the reason for him pointing out his new job so much. He sounds anxious about the early rise time required for his new job and the fact that drinking late so often may make him late to work. He is expressing these feelings in an odd way but I think it might be related to the alcohol problem. People with alcohol use disorders rely on and frequently use thinking distortions, such as minimization, exaggeration, and rationalization in order to prove that everything besides their drinking is a problem. \n\nHim pointing out that he has a job so often is like him saying \u201clook, I am responsible and I can\u2019t possibly be an alcoholic, you guys staying out longer proves you\u2019re less responsible than me, maybe you all have the problem\u201d.  For him this simultaneously eliminates two issues; drinking is a problem for him and he feels insecure about his ability to maintain a regular job. Obviously his response seems out of left field and it can be condescending to many people but he isn\u2019t responding for the benefit of others. My guess is that he is trying to convince himself he is a responsible and sensible employed person with no issues. It seems to be becoming a type of mantra he can use in order to maintain his disorder and not have to consider change.",
            "Ah this one's obvious, he's resentful and jealous that he now has to wake up at 8am. He thinks he has more of a job then you since you work at home and he's trying to make you feel insecure about it.\n\n\nYou need to have a very clear and honest discussion with him about this and ask him how he feels and tell him you won't tolerate it anymore.",

She doesn't think she's an alcoholic,  you want to know why?  Because she has a job and she goes to work.  In her mind,  alcoholics don't have jobs and they don't go to work,  so as long as she keeps doing those things,  to her she is not an alcoholic.\n\nI'm not saying this is why he is saying that,  but maybe it's part of him trying to justify that it's okay to be at the bar every night or to keep on drinking.  Either way,  this is bizarre and hope to see an update.  Good luck!",

            "I'm going to attempt to empathize with your boyfriend here to give another perspective. (full disclosure - I have NOT read any of the 308 comments already here.)\n\nPeople who whine when adults need to leave are really frustrating and annoying. The rudeness is from the person who is basically putting someone on the spot for wanting to go home. He shouldn't have to explain himself. You guys are adults. \"It's time for me to go home. Thank you so much for a great time. Good night!\" should not require any further explanation. \"I have a job\" is, I think, his strike back at being expected (wrongly so) to provide some sort of reason for wanting to leave.\n\nAdding... Likewise, when people make plans, anybody should be free to say \"nah - I can't do that, but thanks\" without having to list the reasons why. Again, the rudeness is in expecting anybody to provide explanations for their decisions.\n\nDoes it excuse him being angrily dismissive? Not at all, and I'm guessing part of that is the alcoholism talking. I hope you both get help for that (for him as an addict, and for you as a person having to deal with his addiction).\n\nAdding a bit more... If he feels he needs to say something, suggest that he says something like, \"When my sleep patterns get out of wack, everything gets out of wack. Thanks for understanding.\"",

And it sucks when your cool, fun friends can all go to work AND be social AND love what's going on in their lives more than I could possibly enjoy my tedious 9-5 office job. \n\nMy advice: \n\nCommunicate. Tell him that this sounds resentful and arrogant, but gently.

Maybe he isn't wording it properly but I don't see the issue. Just because his friends are willing to drag themselves into work at 8 doesn't make him condescending for not wanting to do that. He isn't saying everyone else doesn't have work, but that he does and being there on time is a priority to him. This is a very good thing in a 33 year old man.",

He needs to communicate better. An appropriate response to \"can you stay over at my  tonight\", isnt I have a job. He probably means to say \"I cant risk sleeping in so I should make sure Im at my home tonight love\". \nIt seems he means well and his specific behaviour seems mature but his communication is on a grade schooler level.\n\nI strongly reccomend encouraging his hardworking reponsible mentality but get a coach or counseller to work on communication.\n\nAlso a great way to approach men isnt beating around the bush. Ask him to sit down and talk. Let him know you think he means well. Ask him if when he says he has a job means that he doesnt want to mess it up by being late or tired. Appreciate his hard work and let  know that you think he needs to communicate his thoughts better but can appreciate his effort.\n\nI wish you luck, if the conversation doesnt work you have bigger problems to deal with.",

            "How is his new job going? How recently did he start? My guess is that it's not just about just the hours and having to wake up early, but just him expressing frustration or even signaling that he wants some support or wants to vent. Like, I know you're getting defensive about him saying this, given that your job and school is more flexible or at least less predictable, and he's locking into an 8-5 schedule, but him doing this is more about him and how he's feeling than directly about you or him taking an objective look at that friend's schedule. Yes, what he's doing is childish and maybe he does mildly resent that you get to define more of your schedule while his is more brick-in-the-wall-ish, but when a partner starts doing something different, it's usually a good idea to give them the benefit of the doubt that it's not coming from a \"I have a problem with you and want to start a fight\" place, but a \"Something is bothering me and I'm not sure what to do with these feelings\" place. My point is that rather than trying to battle him on the behavior, try to suss out/get him to open up why he's feeling the way he's feeling that is causing this behavior.\n\nIs he getting enough sleep? Do you think his drinking is maybe more of a negative (affecting his mood negatively) than a positive (a way to unwind)?\n\nThe only other advice I have, and this is because you assumed he was saying this because of your schedule, that maybe you look into aligning your schedule with his a bit more if you feel like you could be keeping a better schedule yourself. Like, if you're always up working/studying until 4AM and sleeping in until noon most days, maybe try getting up with him and doing some of that work/study in the morning and going to bed when he does a few days of the week. Like, sure, if you have a work deadline or homework/paper due, sometimes you have to stay up to get it done (I'm so glad I'm done with my masters, you have my sympathies), but aligning your schedule to his might make you feel a bit better about this, if you think you could be doing better with your schedule, and have the side effect of making him feel better out of solidarity. Like, I wouldn't do this to reward his childish behavior, but rather because you think \"Yeah, I'm not doing myself any favors grinding work/study in the wee hours of the morning and could be doing more during the day and I would feel better getting consistent sleep on a more consistent schedule\", if that makes sense.",
            "Next time your boyfriend spouts off with \"I have a job\", maybe point out that most adults work 40+ hours per week so his employment status hardly makes him unique. And that he comes across as condescending and even a bit naive when he acts like having to be at work at 8am is an especially arduous task. I mean, if you can't be honest about the fact that he's making an ass of himself, why are you in this relationship at all? Partners should be able to call each other out for rude/unpleasant/bad behavior without feeling as though calamity will ensue. Granted, my own wife is very sensitive to criticism and so even well-intentioned and gently delivered comments can sometimes trigger an argument...but that's part of being in a relationship. If he can't handle hearing your opinion, is your relationship strong enough to last for any length of time?",

I get socially exhausted really easy and have to have time alone after. I can\u2019t just come home, go to sleep, and then get up the next day. Some people can do that working the same hours and be fine. For me it overstimulates me where I can\u2019t relax. So I like to go home for a bit and relax or spend some time alone. He very well might just want some time alone. He might just not be communicating that. I noticed people that can do multiple social things don\u2019t have issues with this. So it seems strange to them. His phrasing is just odd. \n\nI would talk to him and just be pretty direct about it. Ask him why he says that and what he actually means by it.",

Let him express himself. \n\nYour next answer could be \u201cWhen you tell me that you have a job, I understand that you mean [whatever feeling he said], but it actually makes me feel really condescended down to and I really don\u2019t like it. I know you don\u2019t mean to hurt me, so can we stop with that particular comment?\u201d\n\nAfter, if it comes up again, call it out. \u201cI\u2019ve told you I don\u2019t like it when you say that to me. Let\u2019s change subjects.\u201d",

            "Lmbo i cant help finding this funny sorry \ud83d\ude02 i am 23 and have worked 2 jobs and still managed to do things in the lil spare time i got, usually only running off 3-5 hours of sleep, and now? Ft with twins, and i work from home as a sub contractor for comcast, so i deal with back to back angry people from 7-10 am, clean house and take care of kids, back at work 2-5 pm, finish cleaning/laundry, also making foods for them and husband and myself, on top of then dinner, putting kids to bed, dealing with them when they wake up, by now its 10 pm, then i have to make sure im taking care of my husband and spending time with him so he's not feeling neglected, so i dont get to bed until 12- 2 am generally. I Know thats all my choice, but my point is that if i am doing a shit ton of stuff 24/7 on what feels like no sleep (sometimes i have fallen asleep while working...) Then why cant he give his friends a lil time? They will stop trying eventually.",

            "So I think you should either encourage him to go to councling or have a deep talk nicely about his behavior. You\u2019re clearly worried that this job is affecting things negatively and I think you need to help him break that down as he doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s doing well. \n\nIf you get him to talk, something I\u2019d ask is if your stressed or whatever why keep working? Maybe he feels trapped or not appreciated and it\u2019s coming out on everyone else. I think a good supportive talk would help things. It\u2019d allow you to express your hurt for when he throws around \u201cI have a job\u201d but also allow him to know you\u2019ll be there him and want him to be happy :)"
