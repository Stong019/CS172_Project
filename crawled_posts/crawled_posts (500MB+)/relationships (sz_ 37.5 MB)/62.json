He ended it because he wasn't ready for commitment, according to her. We've been engaged since July, with the wedding set for next September.\n\nOver the Christmas holidays she told me that since we are getting married, we need to be open and honest with each other, which I have been about my whole life, and I thought she had.\n\nCome to find out she considers her ex to be soulmate and if he asked, she would go back. She said this is normal for most couples to have an arrangement like this, and that he may never say anything. If that is the case, she loves me and wants a life and a family with me. I got upset and said why are you with me then, and she told me to calm down, that everyone settles. She said she will always love me, but this is just the way things are.\n\nI've been avoiding her for days now. I am incredibly hurt, I thought she wanted to spend her life with me, but now it is with an asterisks. \n\nAm I overreacting, like she says? Is it normal for people to have this type of situation?\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Fiance said she is soulmates with her ex and would leave me if he asked, said this is normal for most couples.",

Not great, but you'll do.\"\n\nI'm guessing you aren't too thrilled to be the backup plan, the spare tyre.\n\nI mean, props to her for coming out with it, when she could have kept silent.

            "You're fiance ~~basically~~ literally told you she's just settling for you, that has to hurt like hell.  This is one of the more idiotic requests I've heard of.  No couple does this.  And who defines her soul mate?  I'm assuming her?  Shes basically saying she will leave you the moment she finds someone \"better\".  I would not marry someone with her mindset.  Oh and soulmates only exist in the movies which it appears she's watched way to many of.\n\nEdit: fixed wording ",
            "Never be someone's second choice OP. This is not normal in relationships. You deserve an SO who thinks the sun shines out of your ass, not someone who'd leave you in a heartbeat for their ex. This is a huge deal, and imo, a dealbreaker personally. Your smartest move would be to just end the relationship and move on. I'm not sure how to resolve this situation any other way with the least amount of pain. ",
            "If I were in your shoes, I would break up with her over this. This is not an acceptable or normal thing for spouses to do to one another. It should tell you all that you need to know that she doesn't respect you enough to stay out of a relationship if she still holds a candle for her ex. Especially since she pretty much said \"I will marry you\" and \"But I'll leave you for my ex the second he asks\" in the same breath. That isn't love or respect. That is \"I'm too insecure to be alone, so I'm going to drag you along behind me until I don't need you anymore\". That is not okay.\n\nI encourage you to have the self respect not to be this girl's second choice. If she wants to wait around for her ex, I say let her do so and let her do so while she is single. You deserve to be someone's number one, not wondering every day if your fucking **wife** is going to come home or not. \n\nETA: I am a married woman. I do not believe in \"settling\" nor does \"everyone\" do it. She is lying to your face in order to normalize her bad behavior. It's even more manipulative that she waited to tell you this not when you got into a relationship but when you've already decided to marry her. Most likely hoping that because you're so attached, you won't dump her like she deserves. She is a shit partner and a shit person. Don't marry her, OP. You can and should do so much better than a partner who 100% will always put their ex first.",
            "It's not normal to go through the motions of marriage when you do not consider your affianced to be your soulmate. Generally if you don't want to be with a person for forever, you don't enter into a legal/formal contract to be with that person for forever. That is dumb.\n\nThat's very very different from already being in a marriage and \"settling\" or entering into a marriage of necessity (i.e. because of an unplanned pregnancy, say). Normal people don't voluntarily and knowingly allow/encourage others to commit to something they aren't committed to themselves!\n\nDo not marry this woman so long as she maintains this position.",

She said this is normal for most couples to have an arrangement like this, and that he may never say anything.\n\nIt's not normal to have this agreement, and it's not ethical of her to have withheld this from you for four years, especially as you're clearly in a serious relationship (as evidenced by your impending matrimony). \n\n>If that is the case, she loves me and wants a life and a family with me. I got upset and said why are you with me then, and she told me to calm down, that everyone settles. She said she will always love me, but this is just the way things are.\n\nLots of people do settle. However, there's a big difference between, \"Ideally, my husband would have abs, but my fianc\u00e9 doesn't, and I love him to bits anyway.\", and, \"Ideally, my husband would have abs, but my fianc\u00e9 doesn't, and if someone with abs asks me to leave my husband I will.\" You see the distinction, right? In the first case, you're settling because overall the good significantly outweighs the bad. In the second case, you're settling until a better offer materializes. \n\n>I've been avoiding her for days now. I am incredibly hurt ... Am I overreacting, like she says?\n\nHonestly, I think you should call off the engagement. Not as some dramatic gesture, but because you apparently have radically diverging conceptions of marriage. Take marriage off the table, and work out how you feel about the relationship. If you manage to resolve these issues, then you can possibly continue to date, and become engaged again when the time is right. As of today, you have a fundamental difference of opinion when it comes to marriage, and that isn't something which can be wished or talked away. It's there, regardless. I would advise you not to get married until you see eye-to-eye on the fundamentals. No pleading or promise can fix this, it will take time for you to see eye-to-eye, if you ever do. Communication is critical, as is standing up for your values. \n",

She doesn't care about you. \n\nIf ever her ex feels like a booty call, she will cheat on you. If she finds someone she thinks is better than you, she will cheat on you. When she gets bored of you, she will cheat on you. She has probably already cheated on you if she's been in contact with her ex at all. \n\nWhen she divorces you (and eventually she will) she'll take half your shit and probably your kids too, if you're stupid enough to have kids with her. If you stay with this selfish monster, she will break you and waste the best years of your life. \n\nYou know what you have to do. Do it to save your own future. Cut off contact and ignore her calls, texts, and emails. This woman does not deserve one minute more of your time. ",

He was part of my relationships, whether I liked it or not. He was always in the back of my mind. My way of thinking is that we would be together again one day, and it doesn't matter who I was with between things.\n \nWell, after my very long relationship ended, I called him up. He felt the same way. He flew out to see me after 8 years. We hugged, confessed our love for one another...it was like 8 years hadn't passed at all. It was all so perfect, just as I had imagined. We ended up having the best sex I've ever had in my life. Right before he left, I told him I wanted to be with him. He was the love of my life. He told me he felt the same way, but that he couldn't commit and needed to fly back. Being with me just didn't fit into his equation. That was all I needed. Closure so I could move forward. After a decade of loving him. \n\nMy point in all this is that the feelings she has just won't turn off unless she gets back with him or seeks closure like I had to. It's a pretty shitty thing saying what she said to you, and you have the right to be angry and hurt. I actually told my boyfriend at the time something similar in the heat of an argument, and I wouldn't have blamed him one bit if he had ended things right then. My heart never was truly in it because of this guy. Now, I am in a healthy relationship with someone different where I can completely give my all to him. \n\nI would take a step back and tell her I needed a break from her so she could figure things out, honestly. You guys have a history and you care for her, but you're just wasting your time at this point. You should have someone feel for you the same way she obviously feels about her ex.

I'd postpone that wedding.\n\n\nWhether you want to live with this or not or work past it, that's up to you, but I wouldn't get married to someone until this is all figured out. You're allowed to not be okay with this and want to be with someone that just wants to be with you, build a life and family with just you. If you decide you want to call off the wedding and engagement, you can and aren't wrong for it.",

If the answer is no, then it's clear you need to move away from this woman to someone who will give you the love and respect this one is obviously lacking.",
            "No, it's not normal! My husband IS my soulmate. Not everyone believes in that sort of thing, but for people who do, why would they want to settle for someone else. If YOU believe in soulmates and your fiancee is saying you are not hers, then I definitely would reconsider going through with the marriage. ",
            "Yeah I would also cut your losses here OP. Let her go. Maybe she will decide you're the one she wants someday soon but it's obvious she is harboring feelings for this dickhead and you don't need that shit in your life. It's a process man, but hey, I'm 23 and I have been married and divorced (married at 19 divorce papers just arrived about a month ago) and let me tell you, that is not a fucking road you want to go down with someone if you're/she's not sure.",

Dump her today.",

She is either too blind, too manipulative, too lovestruck, or all of the above to get that. She is actually telling you you are second best. There is no way you are ok with that. You shouldnt be. Thats wrong and inconsiderate of her to hang on to you when she isnt even over her ex she barely spent any time dating. In the grand scheme of things, 2 years is not much. \n\n> she told me to calm down, that everyone settles\n\nWhat in the flying fuck?\n\nI wonder...is she actually trying to be passive aggressive? Or is she just slow? Or really fucking rude?\n\nI am utterly livid for you. You *should* be avoiding her for days. Your responding just as you should, except one thing, next you should leave her. I mean it. What she said to you is awful. You are never going to forget it. Whether you leave her now or not she has killed the relationship. Its not going to ever be the same after this.\n\nIm sorry this happened to you OP. Sounds like she has been gaslighting you. She actually almost made you think she was in the right.

Don't put yourself through that man... you deserve someone who's into you, who thinks of you as their #1 just like you do them. *You'd* be the one settling if you married her... you'd be settling for a life of being 2nd best.",
            "HaHa.  It most definitely is not normal for a couple to have an agreement that if an ex snaps a finger one of them can go running back.  Normal couples make a commitment to each other.

Maybe in romantic comedy films, or TV shows like Sex and the City, it happens, but she's basically telling you that she settled for you, and will jump ship at the first chance she gets. You have every right to be hurt by her words and should strongly reconsider your future plans with this woman.",
            "WTF? It is not normal for couples to have this conversation. \n\nShe said it herself, she is settling for you.\n\nYou need to decide if you are okay with being her \"safe\" option and second choice or if you want to risk it, end the relationship and find someone who thinks you are the only one for her.",
            "It's NOT normal. At all. No matter how good of a catch you are, she sees you as the person she settled for and you don't deserve that. You're lucky she told you this 9 months before the wedding, it sounds like it may be time to put those plans on hold and reevaluate.",
            "I don't normally participate in the \"lawyer up and file for divorce\" responses that can be found around here.\n\nIn this case, I'll make an exception. Thankfully you are not all ready married. I would, very calmly, explain to her that it is not \"normal for most couples to have an arrangement like this\". You agreed to marriage with someone that is telling you that if an ex-bf ever wanted her back, she would jump shit with no remorse whatsoever.\n\nI wouldn't be okay with that in any shape or form. That is entirely unacceptable and downright disrespectful to you as a person. That's the type of shit that makes a person go from \"in love\" to \"I don't ever want to see you again\" in an instant.",
            "Run, just fucking run.  This is not normal.  This is her giving herself an out if she cheats on you in the future.  Like some sort of sick warning.  This is a sign of lack of respect and of how warped and selfish a person she is.  What matters is her happiness and she is obviously not over the other guy.  You are just a safer option, but one she would ditch in a heartbeat if the other guy came back into the picture.  \n\nI'm sorry, it's a super shitty spot to be in .  ",
            "Do not marry this woman. Are you kidding me? She just admitted that you're her second best option, not her priority, **and** that she'd leave you in a second without any regrets. Is this who you want to establish a life (and possibly children) with?",

You need to talk to her, she probably needs to talk to him.

This person will be your partner in life and tbh she sounds like a shitty partner. Sounds like she's not your \"soulmate\" and why should you settle for her.",
            "Um no, you are definitely not overreacting. People who settle get divorced because they wanted a wedding and not a marriage with the person they chose. She will constantly be looking for something better than you. If you believe in soul mates and you don't think you're marrying your soul mate, then you shouldn't be getting married at all.",
            "You are not even REMOTELY over reacting. What your girlfriend said was horrific. She basically said you're 2nd best and that she's settling for #2 since she can't have what she actually wants, which is her ex. Please marry somebody that thinks YOU are #1, this isn't normal.",

That's crazy. Good luck. ",

The car incident was just one among many other things. I was very much in love with him so I forgave many things like constantly being told I was unintelligent and helpless, being treated roughly, him holding me by my arm and pinching it because he was mad at me, stonewalling, being yelled at and cursed at, him saying he felt like cheating on me. The breakup was really hard because I cared so much about him and he didn\u2019t take it well. It\u2019s crazy because in the moment it felt so hard but literally the day after I felt so relieved! I feel so free, like I can be myself again. I had been struggling with this constant feeling of anxiety the past few months and since I broke up with him I have not felt that way again! Thank you all for the heartfelt advice and tough love. To all of you please remember to not let your feelings for someone cloud your judgement!\n\nTLDR: My bf scared me in my car, I wasn\u2019t sure if I was overreacting. I broke up with him for a myriad of reasons and finally realize how angry and aggressive he was.",

He got upset with me because the knife was hitting the cutting board \"too loud.\" I tried to cut the hard vegetable more quietly, but couldn't and he kept flinching and twitching and getting mad about it. I told him there wasn't much I could do, if he kept his knives sharper I wouldn't have to use so much force to cut the raw carrots. \n\nThis interaction really stuck with me, and it honestly helped me see all the other glaring red flags he had. That was the last time I saw him. To this day, if I chop something loudly on the cutting board I think of the bullet I dodged. It's crazy how a small thing like turning off the radio or complaining about kitchen sounds can just flip the switch and help you see everything else that was wrong for you in the relationship.",

There may be some moments where you might be really tempted to contact him or even reconcile. It's important that you look back on this post and remind yourself about all the awful things he did to you, so that doesn't happen. The mind has a tendency to try to minimize trauma-- this is important for mental healing but imo is kind of dumb as a survival instinct lol. Just watch out for it and be prepared. \n\nAlso if you're anything like me, you might have some moments where you feel disgusted and disappointed in yourself that you still have residual feelings of affection for him. Luckily I had someone tell me this: Affection/love doesn't just switch off like a light switch, even in cases of abuse. Breaking up is a process. There were parts of the relationship that were good and great-- there must have been, otherwise you wouldn't have been in it. It's ok to miss those things and to lament what could have been.

He will likely try to lovebomb you, begging and pleading, promising to change. Don\u2019t believe it. He doesn\u2019t love you, he wants you back because he know has lost control over you. That\u2019s what abuse is about: it\u2019s about them feeding off of controlling you. When they lose that, their reaction makes it seem like they want YOU so badly. But that\u2019s not what they\u2019re wanting. He doesn\u2019t want you. He wants CONTROL over you. That\u2019s what he\u2019s missing and that\u2019s what he\u2019ll be wanting to get back.",

I have turned the basement of my house into a BDSM dungeon with a lot of equipments, latex outfits, cuffs, chains, spreaders, bondage equipment, swings, dildos, strap-ons, benches, etc.\n\nMy boyfriends mom is visiting from the other side of the country and is staying with us for a few days. This is fine. She's been wanting to visit his son and get to know me better and I think it's lovely.\n\nShe is a rather devout Christian and believes in things like modesty, traditional gender roles and even abstinence before marriage. I don't have a problem with her if that's how she wants to live her life. It's not for someone like me who's basically the opposite of those things. \n\nI always lock the door to the basement. It's a private room and I don't think it's unreasonable to lock one of your rooms when you have guests. It should be clear that a locked room is supposed to be left alone. Apparently she does not understand this. Yesterday she asked where door leads to and I told her that it's the basement and it's just full of stuff and it's always locked because I don't want my niece and nephew who visit often go down there (not a lie, it is the truth).\n\nThis morning I went out for a run when she was still sleeping. My boyfriend has a night shift at the hospital so he was away. When I came back I noticed that she has broken into the basement (took the key from the drawer in my room) and she asked me to \"answer for this\". I didn't, just kept asking her why is she down here and how she got here and she explained that she thinks I was disrespectful for locking a room to a guest and she had to find out what I'm hiding down there because she thought it could be something illegal but instead she found, as she called it, \"evil material of a shameless slut\". She then went on a rant about how ungodly these things are, that I have corrupted her son, how I'm of the devil and going to hell and she's not going to allow me to take her son with her, and things like that.\n\nI just asked her to get out of the basement, stay in her room until his son arrives and she can deal with him as I don't think I need to justify my lifestyle or my belongings to her. She called me a whore and went out of the house. That was 30 minutes ago.\n\nI texted my boyfriend and he hasn't responded yet. Not sure what I should do now. I really don't want her in my house ever again.\n   \n**tl;dr**: Boyfriend's holier-than-thou Christian mother found my broke into my room and dungeon, then called me a slot and whore for having sex toys that she disapproves.",

            "I agree with everything said in this thread, you're 100% in the right. Being a guest somewhere doesn't give you unlimited access to everything in that home, that's stupid. Do you think guests to the White House are allowed to run around going into every room because \"they're guests?\"\n\nThis really gets me though.\n\n>she had to find out what I'm hiding down there because she thought it could be something illegal\n\nSo her response to a locked basement - basements are often used as storage, they're out of the way, nobody *needs* to be in a basement - is to go into your bedroom, snoop for a key that she doesn't know the appearance of, take any key she sees to use on the basement door, and then...what. What if you had a meth lab down there? Was Mighty Mom just going to stand there proudly \"I FOUND THE METH LAB, THIS IS ILLEGAL, I'M VICTORIOUS!\" And then your evil empire will just crumble because one nosy Christian lady in her 50s saw your setup.\n\nThat excuse is so hilariously lame that I think we need to send it to the glue factory. She's a nosy snoop that doesn't respect boundaries and she did this because she can't handle being told no. I guess in a way it's good that she showed these colors now rather than testing your boundaries in smaller ways over several years. Now you *know* she's an invasive prima-donna, and knowing is half the battle!\n\nBest of luck navigating the fallout, OP.",
            "Pretty sure she's gone through everything in your house. ",
            ">disrespectful for locking a room to a guest\n\nWTF? I think you handled this excellently by sending her to her room.\n\nI hope your BF kicks her out to a hotel",
            "If she can afford to be so rude and disrespectful she can afford a hotel for the rest of her stay. \n\nHer justification for her actions shows that she likely never had any respect for you and was just snooping for something to get self-righteous about. ",
            "So she stole, and broke into a room of your house, for jesus?\n\nhuh.\n\nHonestly, sounds like you handled it right, I think the next step is in your boyfriends court.",
            "This woman doesn't respect you or your property and I wouldn't let her stay in your home anymore. Honestly, I'd make it clear to your boyfriend that his mom completely ruined any relationship she has with you at this point and that if she doesn't respect you, then she can find someplace else to stay, but you aren't letting her stay or even visit your home again. ",
            "She broke into a locked room. That by itself, without the unnecessary judgment and disrespect, is enough to justify never letting her in your house again.\n\nYour boyfriend needs to be on your team for this. No excuses or capitulating to her. He needs to back you up that you don't want her over anymore, shut down any name calling, and make it clear that what she saw is none of her business and that he's an adult who won't be leaving you just because his mommy is unhappy with his choice. (You don't mention any problems with his attitude toward his family in your post, but I wanted to say it because it comes up so frequently on this sub.)",
            "Oh geez...your boyfriend's Mom sounds like one of those people who can't keep their nose out of other people's business.  Her behavior in no way reflects on you two, it just proves that she cannot be trusted and shouldn't be left alone unsupervised in other people's houses.  A locked room is typically locked for a reason.  Whatever that reason is, is no one's business and they should stay out.  \n\nI think you did the right thing by not justifying anything to her.  You and your boyfriend are adults, your life is yours to live how you choose and if she doesn't like it, she can go stay at a hotel.  Let your boyfriend handle her because it's not your place to do so, but if that was my Mom, I would be having a serious conversation with her about disrespecting my SO's privacy and the awful name-calling.  She had no right to disrespect you.\n\nI always kind of think that people who vehemently attack others about their sexual behaviors being \"wrong\" or \"evil\" are either a) completely boring sticks in the mud who refuse to acknowledge that they have sexual drives or b) secretly into kink but their religion or whatever has them brain washed into thinking it's wrong, so they over-compensate and go nuts about it.

Feel free to tell her I said so.  Btw - I'm a christian too - mucking around in others' private things is not a christian thing to be doing.\n\n\nYou take care.\n\n\n*Nana internet hug*",
            "Let me get this straight.\n\nYou gave a valid reason for why you had a locked door in your house.  BF mom didn't like that reason so she took it upon herself to \"Break in\" and didn't like what she found?\n\nI think the only thing you need to say to her when she gets back is.\n\n\"Collect your things, leave, and never return. You are never welcome in my home again.\"\n\nIf your BF doesn't take your side and stand up for you, He goes too.  Seeing how BDSM is all abut communication, trust and respecting boundaries.  He should easily be able to understand the major breach of trust his mother has shown you, and him.\n\nGood Luck OP! ",

Then you should email her a random BDSM pic every day forever just to mess with her. People like that are disgusting. That is your house  you can keep anything you like in it. To know that she went through the trouble of ransacking your room to find the key means she has absolutely no respect for you or your privacy and she doesn't deserve to be in your home. You deserve an apology from her. Especially for her calling you a slut while she is a guest in your house.  Your bf better back you up and say that stuff is his too. Whatever you do do not just act like this is by any means \"ok\" because she completely stepped out of line. What is she a burglar? Tell her shes going to hell for breaking and entering.

I'll bet his mom is going to tell him how he HAS to leave you and HAS to break up with you etc etc.\n\nThe mom's going to drive a wedge no matter what you do now, so I think the best thing you can do is take the high road and let them sort it out.",

You told her rather politely that the door is to remain locked and she completely overstepped **simple** and **clear** boundaries.\n\nI would suggest kicking her ass out to a hotel if she will not respect your home. \n\nAlso, your boyfriend should be on your side in this.

In my home, we have several locked doors. One being my basement (its dangerous in there) and another being my closet. It has lots of BDSM stuff in it. If my mom, or my gf's mom forced their way in there, I would be livid.\n\nIf I read it right, you have a child with your boyfriend and love him a lot. So you want him to stay but if it were me, his mom would be getting a hotel room when she visits and never be allowed in my home again. ",
            "I recommend the following:\n\n When your boyfriend comes home, say this: \"I am sorry to have to come up with rules like this, but I do not want your mother in our home for any reason.

I know she is your mother and I know it will feel very conflicting for her to be banned from our house. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to support you through this process.\" \n\nIf he seems in agreement with this, awesome! Be sure to support him through this process of limiting his relationship with his mother.\n\nHe might make up excuses for his mother and put it on you. If he says something illogical (like \"This is my house too. You can't just tell me who can and cannot come into my house\"), tell him his behaviors are irrational and ask him why he is being irrational. Example: \"Your mother went into my private bedroom and stole a key to look through my private things and all I am asking for is protection against my mother. Why are you behaving as though I am trying to control your life?\" This might get him to respond rationally. And then he may eventually agree with you that you are taking the appropriate action. If he (in this hypothetical scenario) just keeps on blaming the situation on you, I think you should leave him.",

            "It disturbs me how people assume that having a \"guest\" status somehow allows full-range use of someone's house. Unfortunately, devout-religious folks like that are often into dogmatic shaming if they find something out of the norm, especially when dealing with a female. Mother Dearest should probably realize that her sonny-boy is big enough to make decisions on his own and isn't \"corruptible\". In her head, you're the scapegoat.

            "You see, I have the exact opposite problem.\n\nI wanted an opportunity to meet my son's girlfriend. I don't necessarily approve of them living together before marriage, but as a Christian woman, I want to see past other's faults and try to get to know my future daughter-in-law. They live on the other side of the country, so I opted to visit for a little while to get to know her better.\n\nWhen I arrived, my son's girlfriend explained to me that she kept her basement locked because she didn't want her nieces and nephews getting down there. This gave me a bad gut feeling from the get-go. What could she possibly have in her home that she wouldn't want children to see? What would she be hiding here? I'm concerned that perhaps she was manufacturing methamphetamines, which I've heard are highly addictive.\n\nNow, I know you wouldn't approve of this, reddit, but I actually accidently found the key to the basement. It was in a drawer I opened when I was looking for a Kleenex. I decided that the best thing to do was follow my gut feeling and investigate. My son was at work and my son's girlfriend was suspiciously gone that morning.\n\nI opened the basement and what did I discover? Not a meth factory, but a sex dungeon! Now, as a Christian woman, I was willing to see past the cohabitation and the premarital relations, but this... this was just too much! It wasn't just a vibrator or a simple sex toy, but a whole floor of her house devoted to sex. I'm very concerned about my son. She has strap-ons and dildos that might be used to penetrate my son in ways that he may not be comfortable with. I think this woman might be abusing my son sexually!\n\nAnd then the walls all came down when she got home. She yelled at me, asking me why I was in her basement, while I was trying to ask her about the nature of all these toys. I was simply trying to see if this relationship is truly the best thing for my son, as I think he can be easily manipulated by a strong woman. And she sent me to the guest room in isolation!\n\nReddit, please tell me that I didn't over react in this situation. Let me know if what I did was right. I'm concerned not just for my son's comfort, but for his safety. What if he can't get out of this relationship because his girlfriend is forceful with him? What if he won't speak up against her? My son is at work and not responding to my calls right now, but I'm worried that he won't be truthful to my face if his girlfriend is around.\n\nWhat if he's trying to get out of this toxic relationship?\n\nWhat can I, as his mother, do?\n\nEdit: Ok reddit, you guys aren't understanding or agreeing with parody. Moreover, I was trying to provide the alternative perspective, albeit an unpopular one. So, what would you recommend to a mother who came looking for this kind of advice? How would you help her deal with her feelings about her son? Yes, he's his own person. Yes, she's probably never gotten over the fact that he's her baby. But I can't be the only one who thinks this relationship isn't beyond repair. As a mental exercise, reddit, how would you let the mother know in no uncertain terms that she overstepped the boundaries, but nonetheless calm her nagging fears? Just because she's in the wrong here doesn't make her a devil-woman who deserves to be slandered.\n\n*sigh* Reddit and parody: no-go.",

Recently I found out he was paying for onlyfans through his bank account (we have a joint account and I check our account often because I like to track our expenses) \n\nWhen I confronted him about it he told me his friend had asked him if he could use his card because he couldn\u2019t use his own personal one, I never in a million years thought my husband would pay for such thing so I stupidly believed him. \n\nFast forward a month later and I see the same payments, once again I confront him and yet again he said it\u2019s his friend\u2019s account so I told him to text his friend and ask him to send him the money that was charged, turns out he was lying about letting his friend use his card. \n\nI end up finding the entire truth (by myself because I couldn\u2019t believe anything he said) turns out he had been paying for girl\u2019s nudes and not only that he personally knows 2 of those girls and I know 1 of the 2. He spent $50 paying difference girls for subscriptions. \n\nTL;DR He has had an onlyfans account since around June 2019 and he had also told me he didn\u2019t know any of the girls which wasn\u2019t true.\n\nEDIT: I would like to add that I myself am not huge on watching porn, I probably haven\u2019t watched much or at all since we got married I just didn\u2019t feel the need to so I don\u2019t know much about how it works. Some of you were nice enough to educate me that it\u2019s better for him to pay than to watch free stolen content and I would like to say I 100% agree. I hadn\u2019t seen it that way but I get what you guys mean and I\u2019m sorry if I offended anyone. Not for this relationship because he obviously is a liar but maybe for the next I will be willing to sit down and talk to whomever I\u2019m with about porn expenses. I am still not okay with the lying and paying for people he personally knows which is why I will not be going back to him. Again thank you for the clarification!",

            "At the least he\u2019s a liar. At the worst he\u2019s a cheater. In no way does he come off good in this. He knows it\u2019s wrong or he wouldn\u2019t have lied about it.",
            "So, now that the truth is out, how is he reacting? Personally, I don't really care about porn, but I care deeply about trust. And somebody lying to me multiple times on an issue is a huge breach of trust. Now you know he isn't trustworthy. Has he tried to do anything to fix this?",
            "You're young, get a divorce and you'll find someone who has their eyes on you one day, it's up to you since i am just a stranger but this isn't gonna change and this is the first and only thing i could think of to fix this, good luck!",
            "I'd love to weigh in on this - as a girl who runs an Onlyfans. Bin him, he outright lied to you and has completely betrayed your trust. Well done for going with your gut feeling and questioning him on this! \n\nIf you subscribe to someone's Onlyfans profile, you're supporting them create safe, consensual content and you get your kicks from it too. Onlyfans, if you're a content creator, requires you to validate yourself using ID, therefore is safer than some adult content platforms. If you're a dude or whatever subscribing to my Onlyfans, cool. As long as you dont have a partner. \n\nWhen you have a partner, the rules change. It goes from being a fun way to see adult content and support someone you know, to downright cheating. A lot of the content/services that me and my gal pals offer is 1-1 chat, custom videos or images and theres even an option to add your Amazon wishlist so fans can buy you things (for example an outfit to wear). \n\nHe seriously thinks this isnt cheating? Girl you got this, in the bin he goes xx\n\n\n***Edit: For some reason I've been unable to reply to some of the comments here (I'm new to Reddit and it may be that I was spotted as spam? Who knows)\n\nQuite a number of you have looked at the post I had on my own profile (deleted now because I got the advice I needed - thank you reddit) and spotted I have a bf. I've recieved many direct messages calling me names and it's been exhausting blocking you all.\n\nAnyway I'd like to add that my bf not only knows I have an Onlyfans, he's majorly supportive!!! Some of his friends' girlfriends run their own pages and he put me in touch with them! Weve become a little community who offer each other advice e.g Hey sis I saw you are offering a subscription deal, how do I do that/where are the buttons for this. Or \"what's the best angle for XX pic\". We subscribe to each other (something that may make some of you cringe - imagine seeing your friends bare bum haha). I saw another comment here from someone who's girlfriend fully supports them having an OF. Yay! My bf is the same and loves that I buy him pizza from my 'nudes money'. Its a bit of fun! \n\nThis isnt for everyone and I know that some of you draw the line at Onlyfans completely. But, there are threads on here that explore a lot of opinions on it which I think would be worth reading. \n\nAnyway this ain't my post so I'll leave it at that! OP has gotten a lot of advice from everyone and I wish her all the best x",
            "This is why I never even considered getting married at 20. In the last 7 years I can\u2019t tell you how much both myself and what I\u2019m looking for in a partner changed. Plus you get to try a few before buying a ring for one. If I married the person I was with back then I\u2019d be a very sad man today.",
            "Okay, that's cheating and shitty and you should break up with him. It sucks, but it's a matter of self-respect at this point. He hid it from you, lied to your face, he KNEW these girls so it's not \"just porn\"... there is no redeeming factor here. The trust is broken, the relationship is dead, your only way forward is a divorce.",
            "You\u2019re so young. Get rid of him. It makes it even worse that he knows the girls and they aren\u2019t strangers so that makes you think has he met up with them too?? You\u2019re so young not even near 30 yet. Break up with him cause he\u2019s a cheating bastard. You deserve better hun",
            "I\u2019m a full time onlyfans creator, and I\u2019ll tell you, this is BS and you should bail. \n\nAnything a person feels the need to lie about, is something they know they shouldn\u2019t be doing. If he felt this was innocent, he could easily have said \u201chey babe, so and so has an onlyfans, I thought we could take a peek together. Might be hot :)\u201d - you\u2019re his wife, not a woman he\u2019s on a 3rd date with and can\u2019t be sure how you\u2019ll respond. \n\nEven if he wanted to plead ignorance and act like this is just like watching mainstream porn he would have said just that when you found out. The combination of the story about the friend AND the fact that he just continued doing it after being caught the first time shows he has zero desire to respect your boundaries or practice basic honesty. This guy sucks and he can get fucked. \n\nGood luck to you",
            "Damn... i can feel your pain. Been there myself. It honestly breaks the trust, makes you feel unworthy, and kills your self esteem. Its fine to look at porn but going out of your way to talk and pay for it is where line is crossed.... the trust will never be back and in future you will always have doubt of maybe hes still doing it again.... the truth is i would say break up with him bc it is cheating,... yet sameee thing happened to me and i didnt leave but it does leave a broken gap in trust and theres always that reoccuring thought of what if hes still doing it....",
            "Sorry that your husband is a piece of shit.  He used joint expenses for his personal use, he lied about it, and the fact that he knows any of these girls takes it from the \"it's basically just like porn\" argument and more toward cheating in the most pathetic way possible.  \n\nCheating or not, he lied to your face on repeat.  I know it sucks to fall so in love that you want to marry someone at your age and you really don't want to face the possibility of divorce, but I promise people like him don't change.  Don't count on it.  Do what's best for you and move on now.  You're still young.  I'm 30 and just fell in love, you have plenty of time and plenty of people are still out there looking.",
            "So he\u2019s a lying cheater and he\u2019s incredibly stupid as well, to think he could get away with this when you share the account. Time to ditch this fool.",
            "If it's something your partner would consider a betrayal had they known about it, it's cheating. If it's something you feel like you have to hide, it's cheating. There are ethical ways to get your fixes from other people, but all of those involve clear communication with your partner. This ain't it. Sorry for this, you deserve better.",
            "CHEATER. Not only that, but he LIED.",

            "If he\u2019s willing to lie about that, wait until later. The odds are not good that it won\u2019t get worse. I know three women who got divorced over their ex husbands repeated affairs, and they all started by lying when first confronted.",
            "I am cackling at the justice of you having your own OnlyFans so you can earn enough to separate from this cheating douchewad. Good for you, I hope you make more than enough to leave him in the dust!",
            ">And not only that he personally knows 2 of those girls and I know 1 of the 2.\n\nThe fuck? Dude, that's seriously messed up.\n\nSo you found out that he lied about having the account, and it turns out he was paying for pics of someone he personally knows. That's tough news for any spouse to find out, and I'm sorry that this happened with you.\n\nSo you're probably having a hard time with trusting him right now. If you haven't already, do whatever you need to do to emotionally cope for the short term. After that, tell him how his actions make you feel. Otherwise, punishing him for his decisions won't have any meaning if he doesn't know why his actions are wrong. After that, something you'll eventually need to consider is what things that your husband needs to do in order to regain your trust. Is it as simple as a promise? An action plan? Anything he can do to redeem himself or amend for his mistake? This is something you'll both need to agree to, although you're welcome to get his input for ideas. In the end, if you don't think you can find any possible action he/both of you could take that'd resolve your distrust, then you'll have to consider whether the unresolved distrust in him is worth continuing your marriage.\n\nBest of luck to you, OP.",
            "He doesn\u2019t get to decide what \u201cisn\u2019t\u201d cheating. Cheating is anything that crosses boundaries or breaks trust in a relationship. \n\nYou\u2019re allowed to have your boundaries, and he can either respect them or leave. \n\nI personally don\u2019t consider porn cheating, and I don\u2019t consider subscribing to someone\u2019s account cheating (even if you pay), but I do consider talking to someone and buying nudes from them & exchanging in sexual/romantic talk with them cheating. \n\nAnd I consider buying from, sexting, or anything with an individual that you KNOW definitely cheating. It\u2019s different to me if it\u2019s just random strangers compared to someone you know. \n\nNo one gets to dictate your boundaries in a relationship. \n\nMy partner actually encouraged me to make an OnlyFans & make content with him. Our boundaries are pretty chill in the relationship, but once you start hiding or lying about things then you\u2019re definitely crossing a line in my opinion.",
            "I just want to say congratulations on having the courage and presence of mind to realize that this violation of respect and trust is a sign of much worse things to come and breaking up with the dude. Paying for porn within the confines of marriage doesn't necessarily have to mean infidelity, but hiding things and lying to cover your actions is a huge red flag. If you have any questions about OnlyFans or adult work, feel free to shoot me a DM. It is a fascinating and potentially liberating occupation.",

            "I'm so sorry. This is absolutely cheating. And if it weren't then why would he feel the need to lie and say it was his \"friend\"? He's a liar and a cheater. You deserve better!",
            "First he  must of really want to see those nudes in order to use a joint bank account. Second if he was looking at regular porn I would say that's normal but he's specifically paying to see someone he knows someone he essentially wants to bang. I would leave him. Separate or kick him out\n Give him a month or a few months to realize he fucked up. But if you stay with him dont be surprised if he does that again. Or worse.",

            "He is cheating on you, you need to leave or get a divorce. Luckily, you haven't been married long and you are still young, the longer you stay, the lower your chances get of being able to be happy. If he can't stay faithful to you and be honest with you then you deserve far better and you shouldn't waste any more of your time with him",
            "The guys an idiot and I can see where he messed up if he knew the girls and since pork is free. If you start doing fans only your crossing the line from self righteous to hypocritical faster than your vibrator can turn on for your \u201cfans\u201d",

            "Imo, this could be acceptible, but if and ONLY if he discussed it with you first and you were okay with it. Not only did he do these things behind your back, but also he lied about it twice. BIG red flag, how do you know what else he's lying about?",
            "You deserve so much better than someone that lies to you that way. You're still young and have so much ahead. I would consider a divorce because if he's capable of doing this and lying to you like that then he's probably capable of doing worse.",

            "That\u2019s a massive breach of trust, cheating isn\u2019t always physical. If you were my daughter I\u2019d say leave. Unless you want to try and work it out, if you choose to work it out just know he\u2019s on probation for at least 1 year so just be ready for anything.",
            "Y\u2019all don\u2019t have any kids yet and have only been married 2 years. Leave him and find someone who is honest, faithful and respects you. If he\u2019s lying this early in and in the beginning stages of messing around with other women - he\u2019ll be doing that for the remainder of your life together. When they lie easily once, they\u2019ll lie easily over and over. Go live your life and ditch the extra baggage.",
            "What a low life. My apologies my dear but this is a future divorce if it isn't already. LIEING about expenses, from a JOINT bank account regarding naked women is definitely a step towards infidelity. Also, bruh, everyone knows nudes are free on Reddit from anyone of those onlymeat girls, so, he is a liar and he is stupid (Hahha)? You definitely don't need that. What an idiot. Lol.",
            "Y\u2019all divorced yet or..?",

            "I\u2019m honestly beginning to feel like this whole\nSub is 12 year olds giving 15 year olds advice. Do you love him? Does he love you? Then before you decide to leave wouldn\u2019t you want to know WHY he did this? \nI\u2019m not saying you are at fault here at all. What I\u2019m saying is if you are gonna leave then learn from it. If your not gonna leave then be prepared for a painful and  challenging process through therapy. And be prepared for the process to take a long time.\n\nOr\n\nSplit. Move on. But unless you learn something from this you will be presented a similar lesson again in your next relationship.\n\nSorry for being blunt. I wish you the best of luck.",
            "It's a problem to be sure, but all these people telling you to divorce over it are dumb as hell.  If that's all your marriage is worth then what was the point of getting married?\n\nIt's a big deal to you and that's fair, but talk to him about his behavior and try to work through it together.  There's probably more to this that's worth uncovering.",

            "That's gross and probably won't change if he's acting like \"whaaaat?! It's no big deal baby, it's just like regular porn!\"\n\nIt's not and he's lying to you and it's just his values.",
            "Every relationship has boundaries, spoken and unspoken. Is it objectively wrong to have one of these subscriptions? Not necessarily. It depends on your boundaries as a couple. Maybe you never explicitly told him no cam girls. But you don't hide something unless you think it's wrong. To me it's not the nudes, but the fact that he knew he was doing something out of bounds. He lied about it and tried to conceal it--twice. He's saying that he only respects boundaries that he agrees with, and that the boundaries aren't broken if you don't find out. He probably also believes it's not speeding if you don't get caught. That's not an attitude I want in a life partner.",
            "Jesus christ OP ignore all the ghouls crawling down your throat about ethical porn consumption or whatever. The point here is that your husband's 100% lying to you and emotionally cheating at best. OnlyFans is designed to foster a personal connection between a client and the person they are directly paying for sexual gratification, it is designed to be much more intimate than assume random, generic jackoff material. And if you weren't conformable with even that, Great that's your right to decide your own boundaries.",

            "Usually if it's a random person and your husband is indulging in porn, it's not as bad but still not great. The fact that he knows the girls personally is a quite a lot to take in. It could easily be seen as cheating but clearly your husband is too young or naive to see how wrong it is for him to do this but perhaps porn has just clotted his brain. Have a big talk, discuss how this is basically cheating and try find a solution from there. Your partner \\*will\\* watch porn at some point in his married life but the onlyfans element makes things very questionable. Communicate with him and if it bothers you to the point of making the relationship irreparable then maybe look into separation or couples counseling.

I mean, buying a specific person's nudes when there are so many nudes and videos of different women/people out there for free?

I can see why it would be uncomfortable for a monogamous couple if you know one of the people he's buying content from, so I'm sorry he crossed that boundary! I hope that with the truth coming out finally, you can find a way for it to feel safe for you each to discuss your needs around this, and rebuild trust so your relationship can grow from this.\n\nGood luck!",

            "TL;DR Multiple Offenses- Consider divorce 1st Offense- Consider your vows. You said, \"For better and for worse.\"\n\nBeing married at that age is very difficult. This is a time when a majority of people your age are partying, making new friends and exploring their sexuality. Remaining committed and monogamous is especially difficult. Make no mistake, I'm not excusing his behavior. What I'm saying is, marriages take work. There will be a number of events similar to this that you need to decide if they're worth fighting through.\n\nCan you forgive and work to repair the damage or is this deal breaker? \n\nIs he willing to put in the work to rebuild your trust?\n\nAre you both willing to what is necessary to sustain your marriage or is it time to move on?\n\nI've seen a few comments and I imagine a majority of the rest are similar- He cheated. Get a divorce. If this is not the first time this has happened, I would more than likely agree. Divorce is probably a good idea. But, if this is the first major issue y'all have had, I would recommend considering the commitment you made in your vows. Answer those the questions and give it some honest thought. \n\nHopefully that offers a different perspective. I wish you the best of luck in however you decide to handle it!",

            "Just gonna go out on a limb and say WHO CARES if your husband is paying for porn? It's great that he's willing to pay for it to help support people who produce content. \n\nChances are that he lied about it because he was ashamed and knew that you would make this big of a deal over it. \n\nI know this likely isn't what you want to hear, but this is a relationship advice sub, meaning that it's not intended for you to just validate your frustrations about him paying for porn and try to find a reason to divorce him.\n\nIf porn is the thing that makes you want a divorce, you two probably shouldn't be together anyways.",

While you find it to be cheating. I think however you are focusing on the wrong thing here, and frankly none of these comments have touched on it.\n\n  \n\n\nWhere he screwed up when he lied to your face. When someone cheats it's usually a problem with both partners, not just the one cheating because one hasn't communicated their needs properly or wasn't ready for a relationship. In this case, he made a deliberate attempt to not be open with you which is worse than cheating in many ways but most of all it undermines trust, both in your current relationship, and any future relationships after. Cheating does the same, but it is the lying about it that is the problem.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKnow this, regardless of where either of you two stand, it takes an incredibly mature, open, honest, and communicative couple, one using couples therapy, to work through this.",

You're rightfully angry.... But to end a marriage over paying for porn is wild to me.",
            "I would ask yourself why this bothers you. Many people in relationships, both male and female, watch porn / pay for porn. I\u2019m a female in a long term relationship and we sometimes use porn to connect!",
            "your husband has a pornography addiction. it is the only reason he would pay money to see what he could get for free. what's more than that he is very likely emotionally cheating on you with these women because this is what the entire business model for only fans pornographers are based on. ask any successful only fans star and they will all say the same. the reason people pay for only fans subscriptions is because they want to feel like they have some sort of personal connection to the woman in question. it's easier to pay a fantasy woman for fake love than it is to get a real woman to actually love you. \n\nIf your interested in salvaging your relationship it is certainly possible. it won't be easy but it is possible. first is that your husband needs to realize that he does in fact have a pornography addiction. at this point it's worth pointing out that his lying implies that he was doing something he knew he shouldn't have been and is a sign of a mental addiction. if he is willing to admit that he has a problem and claims that he's committed to working on the relationship then you two should both seek relationship counseling as a team and separate mental health professionals as individuals. the relationship counseling is so that you can work on developing an actual plan on how to solve these issues and better developing healthy communication skills so that neither of you feel inclined to lie to each other anymore. the separate mental health professionals are because you both will likely have your own individual issues to work out. he needs one to help him get over his pornography addiction among other things and you should consider one because being cheated on in any sense is not an easy thing to get over and will damage both you and your relationship if you let it. \n\nif your husband refuses to admit that he has a problem or doesn't actually work towards fixing it then you will have to entertain the idea of a divorce. you can't make this relationship on your own and you both need to know that. if he is resistant to change it might be because he doesn't think that you will actually leave him in which case putting forward the idea of a divorce will either get him moving or reveal that he's not actually all that into you or your relationship, it could also reveal that his addiction is abnormally strong and grips him very tightly but that becomes more of a him issue that he needs to work through that you would be justified in leaving him over while he fixes himself. I hope that this doesn't actually end in divorce and you two work through this but if not the sun will come up tomorrow. \n\nI will also add that i don't think you should just jump immediately to divorcing him. i think you should at least try to resolve this conflict. if you can't resolve it that's one thing, but not even trying is damaging to both of you. you will never be in a relationship with anyone or anything where conflict of some sort doesn't arise. you may be young now and able to go out and find another man with relative ease but you won't always have that opportunity. and if you get older and lose the ability to go and find a man quickly then the method of running away at the first sign of trouble will eventually find you in a rough spot if you don't take time to develop communication skills and conflict resolution skills.",

        "selftext": "My mother is disabled due to a neurological illness. She was diagnosed in her late thirties and I remember her mostly as being sick and needing help. I used to really look up to her as super-mom who could overcome any obstacle. That was until my father died. My father passed over a decade ago while I was still in high school. My brother (36M) and I lived with my parents at the time.  I got a job while in high school after he passed, cleaned the house, mowed the grass, bought food with money from my job, paid bills when I could (minimum wage isn\u2019t much), and made dinner most nights for my mom and me. My brother was rarely in the home unless to sleep or because he wanted money. \n\nOver the years, my brother has been in and out of prison dozens and dozens of times for everything from drunk driving to drug possession to stealing from our mother to assault. He is currently incarcerated. No one mentions him or expects anything of him, except my mother who, in violation of a court order for her own protection that she herself asked for, sends him money and speaks to him weekly as well as sends letters. \n\nBack to my father\u2019s death (a seven month bout with illness). \n\nNearly two years after my father passed. I graduated high school and left for college out of state. I would send my mom money while in college and I distinctly remember, for instance, using my stipend I received in December to buy my mother and brother Christmas gifts because I knew they wouldn\u2019t have anything if I didn\u2019t. No one reciprocated, but I didn\u2019t expect it. Honestly, I didn\u2019t care either until it became a pattern over the next decade. That particular Christmas, barely 18 years old, and I was scraping together pennies to buy a cheap fridge after I came home on winter break with gifts only to realize there was no food in the house.  My brother, in a drug-fueled rage, tore down the Christmas tree I had bought and decorated and threatened to kill himself unless I gave him money because \u201cno one loved him\u201d and it would prove that I \u201ccared.\u201d It is important to note even at this time my mother continued to let my now-felon brother back into home. \n\nI\u2019ll try to skip through the college and graduate studies years but suffice it to say I met my now-husband and I spent less and less time at home. When I was home or when my husband and I visited, it was as follows: clean my mom\u2019s home, buy my mom food, cook for my mom, take care of my mom. I was and remain very clear with my mother that I will not let my brother into my life as he has threatened to kill me (over prescription cough syrup!), thrown me down my stairs, and broken down a door to get at me (and the little bit of cash I had on me at the time). I have no doubt he would try to hurt my child, my husband, or me to get what he wants. He has told me he will find me and he \u201cget me\u201d for his perception that I have wronged him (for not giving him money), and I have ZERO contact with him. I have blocked all numbers that have any correlation to him including friends he has call from outside prison. Note: My mother let him get my number off her phone. \n\nI have told me mother for years that I cannot have my brother in my life until he at least goes one year drug-free. To date, he\u2019s been unable to do so. He has stolen tens of thousands of dollars from her. She always says she won\u2019t let him back in her house, but she in the end forgives him and the cycle repeats. Next year, when he\u2019s released again, she has told me under no uncertain terms that he won\u2019t live with her but she admits she remains in contact, sends him money, and thinks this is \u201cthe Devil\u201d in him that makes him a drug-addict. He will move back in. \n\nI have offered to help my mom move closer to me as I live many states away. My husband and I even had a realtor come out and start the process of listing our home so we could find a home with space for my mom. My only condition was that she not bring my brother into my son\u2019s life. She has adamantly refused same. She has also refused to look at assisted living facilities, even though I reached out on my own accord and found great recommendations from her doctors.\n\nNow that she had surgery this week, I have had family come out of the woodwork. Honestly, I am resentful of this. I\u2019ve had people who can\u2019t even send me a reciprocal Christmas card tell me that I am \u201cneglecting\u201d my mother by refusing to take time off work and travel to her to take care of her. They do not care that I don\u2019t have the vacation days and would likely lose my job. One even stated that \u201cI wouldn\u2019t care about putting groceries on my table. I wouldn\u2019t work for an employer like that.\u201d Easy words to say; tell that to my hungry toddler. They have said, \u201cWho do you think cared for you as a baby?\u201d and, honestly this one gets to me, \u201cSometimes you have to learn to deal with life. You can\u2019t just ignore it.\u201d\u2014because \u201cdealing with life\u201d includes losing my job, moving away from my toddler in his formative years, and caring for my mother, I guess? \n\nYou can probably tell at this point that I am fed up. I am in a no win position where literally the ONLY surviving family members are telling me to leave my job, my family, my small child, to come care for my mom and help her. They also refuse to put a timeframe on this; it would be \u201cas long as she needed.\u201d I am expected to care for her 24/7, no questions asked. I also strongly feel like they are taking their own resentment at my mother asking them for favors out on me, though I have explained multiple times that I offered for her to stay with us and have the surgery here (at no cost to her, mind you) and she declined. They tell me in response she has a \u201cright to be near her friends.\u201d I have also tried to explain that by bending down to her every beck and call, they are enabling her, but they don\u2019t want to hear it. They do not seem to hear me when I try to explain that, for example, helping her check out of physical therapy facility a week and a half before her doctor\u2019s recommendation, is enabling her and in the long run, not good for her independence. She has grown accustomed to everyone doing everything for her (example, on this past visit, she got very upset with me for not taking her to Wal-Mart because she had to go there at nearly the toddler\u2019s bedtime. This wasn\u2019t an emergency. She wanted to \u201clook around.\u201d). \n\nMy mother in all of this mess has taken the position that although she doesn\u2019t \u201cwant me to lose my job,\u201d a good daughter should care for her mother. I honestly have a lot of animosity toward this proclamation because my mother has not, since before my father died, called me on my birthday; tried to establish any relationship with my son (I am always the one trying to get them to FaceTime or speak on the phone); and in the last twelve years, I can count on one hand the number of times she has called me just to check in on me or my son or ask how we are doing. If she does reach or and contact, there is always an ulterior motive (money for my brother or for her because she\u2019s given my brother everything). \n\nI am at my breaking point. \n\nI can\u2019t work full-time, care for my family, and also be expected to hear multiple times a week how I am a shitty person for refusing to abandon everything I have worked so hard for to care for my mother. Despite everything, I love my mom. My husband and his family have all seen this unfold and multiple people have remarked \u201cWhy do you even try anymore?\u201d (meaning try to schedule calls to allow her to talk to / see my son). I invited her to my home earlier this month, scheduled the plane tickets, assistance though airport, etc., only to watch her play on her phone or spend time playing fetch with her dog rather than read a book to my toddler, who just wanted her attention. \n\nToday, as if a final straw was needed, I called to check in on her and she proclaimed she was going home against doctor\u2019s orders because her dog NEEDS her because the dog is sick. First of all, he has a very minor skin condition that is nearly 100% resolved thanks to her friend  giving him the prescribed ointment. Secondly, my toddler got sick this week (meaning out of daycare for three days sick), and even after I told her of same, she never once called to check on him, just like she never called to check on him when he got the Flu last year, or when he had a mysterious week-and-a-half long illness earlier this year that resulted in four doctor\u2019s appointments and a 104 degree temperature.\n\nI can\u2019t stand it anymore. I am literally writing this as a last resort. My husband is saying to go no contact with everyone (this is ALL the family I have left, except one aunt on my father\u2019s side) because he sees me crying when the hurtful comments role in and the guilt trips. He sees me trying to hide it from my child. But then I feel like I am giving them what they want, right? Look at LittleMissPotatoe, such a crappy human being and so inept at \u201cdealing with life,\u201d she just chose to ignore all of us. But I can\u2019t spend my days defending myself to extended family members I have seen in over a decade or, in some cases, over two decades. \n\nNothing I say is good enough. And nothing I say ever\nwill be. \n\nTL;DR: I have been told in no uncertain terms that I am a horrible person for refusing to abandon my husband and small child and move across county for care for my mother.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for your comments and those who offered support. There were a few recurring questions. \n\n(1) I am not covered under the FMLA. My employer is not large enough and my state offers no comparable law. I have one vacation day left due my son getting sick earlier this year (my husband gets nearly triple the days off than me and has taken off many, many more days to care for him). All-in-all, I don\u2019t want to lose my job or find another one. It\u2019s a good job, just one confined by the limits of being a small company.\n\n(2) She has refused: moving in with me by either my husband and I building a mother-in-suite or moving to bigger home; any assisted care facilities or nursing homes; moving closer. She has flip-flopped on whether she will allow home care but contradicts herself on this point, telling me \u201cinsert name\u201d can help her if she needs anything or she has \u201cfriends\u201d she can call or, most common, that she \u201cdoes fine\u201d and can care for herself. She wants assistance but only *when* she wants it and only on her own terms. \n\n(3) She told me she will not cut ties with my brother. I\u2019 was able to get her to agree to counseling after my brother assaulted her, stole her car, and pawned *all* of her appliances. She moved into a domestic violence shelter, yet she refused to press charges. This occurred when I was going on seven months pregnant and when I refused to travel 20+ hours in a car, I was told essentially the same thing I am being accused of now. \n\n(4) She excuses my brother\u2019s behavior. He has \u201cgot in with the Devil\u201d and she \u201ccan\u2019t abandon him.\u201d I have spoken with counselors, Adult Protective Services, and it boils down to, she\u2019s an adult, she can make her own decisions. Her doctors, although they seem to agree she could use help taking care of herself, have refused to state she lacks the capacity to care for herself.",

            "You poor thing. I grew up with a weird flipped parent/child dynamic too where, for a long time my mother had me convinced that I owed her something and that it was my job to take care of her. My rational mind would tell me that (like you) her demands were totally unreasonable but all I felt (like you) was overwhelming guilt and shame because (like you) that is how I was groomed to feel. \n\nThis is not normal or correct. You are not the parent here. You need to realise that. You don't owe this woman anything. She takes and takes and gives nothing back and she has put your life in danger because she refuses to parent your brother. You owe her nothing and you need to remind yourself of that. You are responsible for you and your child. \n\nYou are also being irrational. The guilt is irrational. You shouldn't feel that way for wanting completely reasonable things and part of you knows that already. That's why this situation is so confusing, it's like you are two people: one telling you what you need and the other one that your mother created telling you to ignore everything and do what she wants. It's hard to unlearn that, but for your own and your child's sake you have to. It's already become clear that your mother sees your child as less important than her and probably a threat.\n\nThe only way to break the cycle, and feel better, is to start separating the guilt (her voice in your head) and your needs from each other. You do that by first acknowledging your self worth. Realise that you are an equal human to your mother and you are deserving of equal consideration and respect. You don't have to do anything you don't want to and it's ok to stand up for what you want. Listen to and amplify the little voice inside you that is telling you that she's unreasonable. Think about what makes her demands unreasonable and whether you should feel guilt in the first place. The more you listen to and understand yourself the quieter her voice will get. It takes time but it gets easier and eventually understanding how you truly feel becomes habit.\n\nAlso, because the guilt is an emotional reaction, it will be the immediate reaction you have, so you need to make sure to give yourself time to calm down and be rational. Don't be railroaded (like now with all the relatives piling on the pressure) into responding. That's what she wants, she wants you to act on your guilt because that's for her. In reality, it's ok to think about it, and what she's asking of you is completely mad by the way... fuck that. \n\nYou also don't owe these strangers anything so don't justify, argue, defend or explain your decision to them (JADEing, it's what people who feel guilty do), just say no or ignore them. They don't offer anything positive to your life so why bother keeping them in it. Same goes for your mother. You'll never get the love you want from her so stop trying to please her and learn to love yourself by caring about what you need.\n\nAnd look at all the great stuff in your life too, the stuff that you built. It sounds like your husband has a good head on his shoulders, you've got a job you like and a child to raise, so go and do it. Live your life, it belongs to you. And be eternally grateful for the fact that you didn't end up moving near to your mother. Never do that. She and your brother are a package, that's clear, and your child can never be near them. See a therapist too if you can. For me, having a stranger be absolutely horrified by my mothers behaviour and selfishness, and validate my own needs was so helpful. Good luck!",

            "If your family thinks your mother has the right to be near friends, so do you, and that means you can't move to your mother.\n\nAlso, there's no point arguing with these people. It should be 100% your decision to do as much or as little for your mother as you want. It's clear your mother has not been a good parent to you, has refused numerous times to accommodate the help you can offer (such as moving her closer to you) and she keeps enabling your junkie brother, giving him money she could spend on hired help and health care etc. It's also clear she has 0 interest in you and your family (partner and child), and only wants the help she needs but isn't genuinely interested in you or your lives.\n\nShe's made her choices and she should lie in the bed she made.\n\nI would absolutely go no contact with anyone who's trying to use you, or calls you a bad daughter for not wanting to turn your life up side down for a thankless parent who isn't willing to help herself. These people will find ways to nitpick even if you would bend to their guilt trips for you to move there. Then it's going to be: \"I heard you hardly ever clean and the place is a mess\", \"I heard you can't even cook and your mother hates the food\", \"I heard you couldn't help this weekend because you thought your husband was more important, how can you be so selfish\" etc. THIS WILL NOT CHANGE. Really. You should only help your mother if you genuinely want to, but it sounds like you don't, and I wouldn't either in your situation and with your backstory. You have your own family now: your partner and your child. They should be your number 1 priority. Of course we should help family and friends out if this is possible and if it will be received gratefully, and if it's not the n-th time you need to help someone out of a mess of their own making.\n\nYou offered your mother plenty of help, namely moving her closer to you are with the only condition that your junkie brother can't be around. She doesn't want to help herself but expects you to help in a way that works only for her. Naaaah, not gonna happen.\n\nDon't defend your decision at all. Tell your mother that you are unwilling and unable to turn your life upside down to help her in a way that fully satisfies her needs but tramples on all of yours and the needs of your family. That she could have taken previous offers of help but chose not to, and that she could have saved the money she keeps spending on your brother to hire help. There's nothing you can do now and ask her to please stop contacting you if it's just to ask for help.\n\nJust because you're related to them doesn't mean they need to be in your life in any way, shape, or form. Choose the family you chose and built, and are building, and drop these manipulative losers. Their behaviour and demands harm you, and will harm your family.  \n\n\nPS: You can also say to these family members guilting you: \"Brother comes out of prison in x months, ask him to help out. I've been helping put food on the table at home since dad died and never even got as much as a thank you. I am DONE. I have my own family now and I need to prioritise my pay check, my son, and my husband. Stop reaching out to me. Bye.\" then hang up. Repeat if needed or just block.",

She will get upset and try to guilt you, have a tantrum, do all of the things that have worked in the past to manipulate you into taking care of her. Do not give in. If you become extremely fearful for her safety you can always contact adult protective services in your state and they are mandated to send out a caseworker to do a wellness check, typically within 48 hours and they can connect her to care in her state. Eventually she will learn to accept resources around her for help or find other people or she will cave in and agree to accept your offer. She is not going to ever accept it now when she is convinced that she/her friends and relatives can bully you into taking care of her instead without any compromise on her part. She will only bend and accept care when she realizes that you aren't going to be bullied or cave in. If she doesn't accept care and is suffering as a result that is ultimately her choice as an adult because she has options for a better life - you have given her several, just not the specific one she wants (which, what loving mother insists on the one option that ruins her child and grandchild's life?). Her friends and relatives may disparage you, let them. They don't help out, they aren't offering to step in for you and do the work themselves so they can screw off.\n\nI would advise against a mother in apartment because it will be very difficult to prevent her from trying to sneak your brother in and you will constantly be having to set boundaries and deal with him showing up and putting your child at risk. I would recommend only offering assisted living facility referrals that her insurance will cover. \n\nUltimately she is your mother and despite everything you will love her, but setting firm boundaries is your way of giving love to yourself and your son, and it will teach your son how to set healthy boundaries for himself in the future.

It's going to be a neverending cycle. You're going to be uncomfortable whether you cut her off, or keep going on the path you're going.

He was actually closer to his step-dad, so he took on his last name and got it legally changed to that. When his bio-dad suddenly died and left behind a whole bunch of debt and business problems, suddenly his dad's side of the family came after him, telling him he should be responsible as it was his father, and he should help them solve these problems. The dad that abandoned him??? Of course, they only complained about his lack of participation when THEY were dealing with this mess, which is what I feel like is going on with your mom's family. Then when inheritance got involved, of course the table got turned and they argued, \"well you changed your last name so clearly you didn't care about being his son, you shouldn't get anything\". My point is if this side of your family, like your mom, hasn't been involved in your family's well-being and suddenly \"cares\" about your involvement with your mom, it's obviously because it involves them somehow. They don't want to deal with the mess so they are guilting you into doing it. My dad, understandably, is not close with this side of the family, and with the exception of holidays, we never see them. We have turned out just fine.\n\nStay loyal to your husband and child, they are your IMMEDIATE family. You have done more than enough for your mother, and if she refuses your suggestions for help, that is on her end. I am happy that your husband is so supportive and has suggested NC, because as an outsider he offers an objective perspective. I think it is ultimately up to you if you want to continue engaging with that side of the family, but from personal experience, you are absolutely right. Nothing you do will be good enough, and if the situation turns to benefit them (like with inheritance) they will likely turn the tables on you rather than acknowledge everything you've done. If nothing else, take a break from contacting them back and say you're going through a lot right now and can't address this. Stop giving your mother money if possible. Don't enable this behaviour. Stay strong \u2764",

If they don\u2019t, then you know they don\u2019t really care. \n\nCousin: Hey you should come out here to take care of your mom.     \nOP: It will cost me $30k to come out and take care of her.

You have done everything you can your entire life, and now when you still, despite the abuse, offer to continue to help her, she declines your help. Honestly, your extended family are being pieces of shit by acting like this towards you and you shouldn't be afraid to tell them you don't care what they have to say, and you literally shouldn't care. You clearly value taking care of family, as do I, but this is seriously an impossible situation.\n\nI would make one final offer, because it seems like you care so much, for her to move there without your brother.

Your mother is a grown adult and so are they.\n\nTruthfully moving across country and abandoing the family who really needs you over the family who bullies you and have their whole lives is when you become a crappy human being.\n\nMy advice, if you won't turn into a fire-breathing dragon who tells everyone off and then makes it so they are scared to breathe sideways at you then this is what you do:\n\nsend an email to everyone that you are NOT abandoning YOUR daughter, YOUR husband, YOUR life and they can stop being selfish and get off their asses and work it out over there, BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT GOING. And that you are taking a break right now from all of this and they need to figure it all out, because it's not up to you to handle it.\n\nAfter that block and delete everyone and pay attention to the family that deserves you. And get some therapy, because you have let these people have way, way, WAY too much power in your life for too long.",

            "Oh girl, my SO could have written this post, and as someone who\u2019s been there watching this trainwreck for the last 10 years, I totally understand how hard it is to be a supportive spouse from the sidelines of the root problem. \n\nFirst off, you and your SO need to agree that your house is a guilt-free zone and he needs to refrain from offering unhelpful suggestions like going no contact and just let you vent. I get it, my SO really should cut out his mother but it\u2019s just not going to happen because it would make things undeservedly harder for his siblings. Me telling him he should just causes more feeling of guilt. Ask your husband to take that suggestion out of his rhetorical armory for a while; he doesn\u2019t need to solve this for you, he need to give you a sounding board to work out your own thoughts and needs.\n\nSecond, figure out what your hard boundaries are. Your boundaries for your brother are a great start, so start thinking about additional scenarios. Would you be willing to pay for/help your mom find a caretaker to visit on a regular basis? Think of the ideal living situations that you would like for your mom, and outline what level of assistance you can be if she takes that option. Stick by your guns of limiting involvement if she makes poor choices, saving the day only reinforces her bad behavior. My MIL has also refused additional medical care, physical rehab, relocating closer to her children, and assisted living options. As a result, my husband no longer helps her with household chores and errands like rearranging furniture and mowing the lawn because she won\u2019t be considerate enough to make living arrangement that make her care easier to accommodate along with his other obligations. Choices have repercussions, and just because your mother is disabled doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s immune to that reality. If your mother wanted you to care for her after surgery, then she needs to have the surgery in your city if that\u2019s possible. \n\nNext, be honest with your extended family. You\u2019re likely conditioned to protect your mom and not be forthcoming about the extent of her BS. That ends today. When Aunt Whoever calls to make her opinion known about your obligations to your mom\u2019s care, lay all the facts out in a calm and thorough matter. My SO\u2019s uncle sometimes pulls this crap, but usually it\u2019s because he\u2019s heard a heavily altered version of the story from my MIL. Once my SO gave him a thorough walkthrough of the reality of my MIL\u2019s finances and how poorly she manages them, accompanied by the texts and emails between SO, MIL, and the bank trying to help and her demanding her right to continue making poor decisions, his uncle agreed that my SO isn\u2019t a bad son for refusing to co-sign on her bank accounts. Don\u2019t feel like you need to protect your mom from the rest of your family, if she thinks it\u2019s appropriate to involve them in trying to manipulate you into doing what she wants, then they have the right to the whole reality. \n\n\nLastly, be realistic about how much time and money you\u2019re willing and able to spend on your mother\u2019s care. Quantify it as a job and figure out what your ceiling of commitment is. This may change over time, but the reality is your mom\u2019s needs will likely increase over time instead of the alternative, so you need to pace yourself to avoid burning out. Currently, we pay for my MIL\u2019s cellphone plan, newspaper subscription, Netflix, lawncare, and a specific amount each month for her to use Lyft and grocery delivery services. This is because it\u2019s easier on our family to do this than spend our very small amount of time off catering to her whims. Figure out what works for you so you don\u2019t feel like your neglecting your mom, but don\u2019t hurt your own family\u2019s future trying to solve all of her problems.\n\nLastly, don\u2019t give her cash money. If she cries poor, ask her to send you the bills and pay them for her. Send her groceries, get her an Audible account, whatever, but if she is dependent on you to subsidize her existence, you have the right to demand that it\u2019s used properly. If she pushes back, well, I guess she didn\u2019t need the money that back anyway. \n\nYou got this. I\u2019m proud that you\u2019ve held it together this long. You\u2019re allowed to say her care is too much for you to handle. I hope the best for you and your family.",

            "\"Family,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will not be able to provide care for my mother. I have tried making it so she can live closer to me, I've tried finding care homes and I've even offered to find a new home so she can live with my family. She has refused all of these, partially due to my request that my brother will not be invited into my home. As you know, he also has a terrible drug addiction that resulted in many psychical altercations. I cannot and will not allow someone who assaulted me near me or my young child. Period. \n\nSo, we are at an impasse. I know many of you would love to see me drop everything I am doing in my life to care for my ailing mother, but because she has made these choices and continues to provide for my estranged brother, I cannot in good conscience give up my life when I have already given up so much. I've lost my time, money, and my well-being to try and provide for my mother, and in return, a lot of my money was given to my drug addicted brother and he assaulted me. \n\nMy mother made the active choice to continue to enable my brother's addiction. If I continue to enable her own behavior, then my brother will continue to suffer. If she wants to make the choice to continue to aid his addiction, then she can do so. But it in doing so, she will have to continue to provide her own care. \n\nWhile I know people have the expectation that children care for you in your old age, this is no longer a reasonable expectation under these circumstances. I will no longer be discussing this matter, and if you are concerned for my mother's well-being than instead of harassing me to do it, you can get off your high horses, drop your jobs and family and make the move to another state to take care of her. Otherwise, you need to back off. It's not your place to dictate what I do. If that makes me an asshole, so be it. I've done enough sacrificing at this point, and I need to think of my child, my husband, and myself.\"",
            "It sounds very much to me that you have spent the vast majority of your adult years putting yourself out for your mother, and it has largely gone unrecognised and has merely become an expectation on her part. I'm so sorry you're going through this, it must be tremendously hard for you to process such conflicting feelings. \n\nOffering to move house in order to accommodate your mother and have her living with you so that you can care for her is an extremely generous thing to do, and I think it's astonishing that neither your mother or other relatives recognise that fact. \n\nIf she refuses help with the terms you're offering that's entirely her decision. You need to stand strong in the knowledge that you have done enough. It is extremely unfair to imply that you haven't. Even more so to expect you to uproot yourself from your own family! You have a two year old son for Christ's sake! \n\nIt seems to me that your mother is either incredibly selfish or mindbogglingly unaware of the enormity of what she is asking.\n\nIf, after refusing your help on the terms you're offering, she and your other relatives continue to chastise you, I would merely state that your offer is there for the taking, and if she chooses not to take you up on it, that's up to her, not you. Don't enter into any further conversations about it. \n\nMostly though, don't let the bastards grind you down! You've done plenty. Live your life, enjoy your son and your husband.

Leaving a child at that developmental stage and leaving with less income to care for them is not acceptable.

He sees me trying to hide it from my child.\"    I agree with your husband.  You sound like a very loving and supporting individual and it sounds like (from my perspective) that your mom and brother are taking advantage of that. Don't let them.   When I read the part about your mom not wanting to be flexible when it came to her moving situation(move in with you or assisted care),it reminded me of my mom when she would say things that didn't make sense.  When that happened when I was 20,I moved out.  Please think about what's good for you.  I highly suggest cutting ties with your mom and brother because they sound very poisonous.",

If she has chosen not to take you up on any of your offers to help or assist that is on her.\n\nYour responsibility right now is to your family.  Your husband and son.  You need to stay employed.  And it's TOTALLY OKAY to put you and your family as the first priority.  This is what you SHOULD be doing at all times.\n\nThink about this:  Everyone else is putting themselves as their first priority.  There is nothing wrong with you doing the same.\n\nAlso, if you quit/lost your job and bad things happened like you lost your car and your home because you couldn't pay the bills..........would any of these people even care?\n\nWe've gone through this with family.  Oh, you have nothing left?  Um, talk to you in six months or a year.  THEN maybe you can help us.  What?  You are on the verge of financial collapse and that's why you can't buy your sister another car?  That's not our problem.  SEE ya!\n\nAnd if you DID quit your job and move to take care of your mother 24/7 how are you going to support you and your mother?  It's a complete joke of a proposition.\n\nYou can argue with your distant family members and friends of your mother til you are blue in the face.  It's not that you are a bad daughter but they just DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM so are putting it on you.  YOU ARE NOT A BAD DAUGHTER.\n\nSheesh.  For ANYONE to say that to you compared to your brother is a total joke!!!!!  But that's what happens in dysfunctional situations, the train wreck of a child is felt sorry for and no expectations are put on him while you have always been the dependable one.  So its expected of you and nothing is expected of him.  WRONG.  INSANE.\n\nGood for you for not allowing a violent leech around your husband and child!  You are not responsible for your brother and it is NOT YOUR ROLE to deal with him because your mother continues her endless cycle of enabling with him.\n\nI have a violent, schizophrenic, drug addict older brother I have not had anything to do with for decades.  He beat the living crap out of me my entire life.  My family wants me to care for him.  Because THEY don't want to deal with it and him using me as a punching bag was supposed to be my role in life.  NOPE.\n\nNo sane person puts themselves in a position where they invite a violent addict in their lives, putting their lives and their family's lives at risk.\n\nDo they think I'm a bad person because I won't open my house to a violent psychopath?  I don't care.  I'm REFUSE to be a page 6 article in the paper that I was murdered by my brother.  My life is worth more.\n\nDo you know how strong you are that your first instinct isn't to jump back into the fire?  Because that is what you were raised to do?  Do you realize how far you have come?????\n\nMy advice because this has worked for me:\n\nHave a final conversation with your mother.  Tell her, these are your options.  X, Y and Z and it will be on my terms.  So pick from those.  There are no other options that will work so I am not going to discuss this further with you.  So take some time to think about this but these are the ONLY options I'm offering you.  And shut her down.  No more discussion or arguments.\n\nRelatives?  Communicate with them ONCE more and say \"I have given my mother several options to choose from.  This is now up to her to decide.  And I'm not discussing this with any of you further.\"\n\nNo one is ever going to think sensibly about \"LittleMissPotatoe\" has done plenty and now has a family of her own.  They are just going to keep coming at you from any direction they can think of TO GET YOU TO DO WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO DO.\n\nFigure out what you can live with, present a set of limited options to your mother, and cease arguing further.  You'll be surprised because when you put someone to the wall and refuse to be manipulated anymore they start to think about self-preservation.\n\nIf that doesn't work, you can always get social services involved to figure out her future care if she will not make a better decision.  \n\nYou keep taking care of you and your family.  Give what you can and help when you can but do NOT flush your life down the toilet for other people's unreasonable demands.  No one is going to be there to bail you out.\n\nAnd you deserve some peace and happiness.  You really do.",

If your mom needs help with feeding herself and going to the bathroom, then an assisted living will not take her and she needs skilled nursing care. \n\nIf she refuses to consider these options, there is no one to take care of her, she is living in a state of self neglect, then you can call adult protective services to do a welfare check for her. They could put her in contact with meal services and evaluate her living situation and mental status. Unfortunately if she cannot be deemed unable to make decisions for herself (has no cognitive impairment) then you cannot petition the court to become her legal guardian and make medical decisions for her. If you did become her guardian, you could force her to accept treated in a nursing home, but that\u2019s the only way. \n\nI\u2019m not an expert on this stuff, I\u2019m just a nursing student with a little experience. Bottom line though is if your mom is mentally competent she can make decisions about wherever she lives, even if it causes harm to her. There are 30 states that have laws requiring children of indigent parents to pay for their food, shelter, and medical care. It\u2019s called the Filial Responsibility law, but it seems it is not always enforced. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in such a difficult situation.

If you expect us to take care of you, you WILL move to our area and live in assisted living.  That is the only way we can take care of you at this point.\"  (Living in their house was a non-starter - my sibs and I were out of the house, but she would have driven them crazy.)   And the friend complaint came up then, but honestly, she does not \"deserve\" to live near her friends, especially if these friends can't be assed to help her out - she can make new friends in assisted living. There is also a stipulation that you are her power of attorney and medical power of attorney, so you can keep your brother from taking any more money from her.\n\nYou need to tell your mother that you will not be disrupting your life any more for her, period.  If she has a house, you have her sell it and set her up with a financial planner so the money is given towards her long-term care and not your brother.

From your post, it looks like you're spending too much time justifying living with your family and raising your child to people. And it's not something that should be open to debate. The more you let them negotiate it, the more you get into a mental state where you start to believe it is negotiable, that there might be a reason to doubt yourself, and that will lead to guilt, depressios, etc., even though all of us can see you're clearly making the right choice to not abandon your child, or even to endanger your child by pressuring your mother to move in, since that will lead to your brother being in your child's life.\n\nSo focus on how to say no. Maybe you need to look into books on that. Maybe you just need to read up on the JADE concept, and really internalize the idea that no is a complete sentence. Maybe practice saying \"That doesn't work for me.\" (I LOVE that sentence, just using it on its own, without explaining further. It sounds more polite than a blunt no, but it's basically the same thing, and gives them nothing to latch onto for arguing why it will work for you. And if they do try to argue, you can just repeat it. The first couple times I used it after seeing it suggested to some other people here, it felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders, and I had to stop myself from smiling in an inappropriate situation - because I just felt that much relief at knowing how to set a boundary. \n\nI want to add too that I don't have all the complications that you have, but I did have to set that boundary with my parents who wanted me to leave my husband and live cross country to take care of them - but they wouldn't move near me because my dad had hayfever and friends in his area. I just shrugged it off and said, well, it's your choice. I did eventually get them to agree to sell their house and move to a place with independent living, where there was an option for assisted living if they ever needed it. If I'd kept being their on-call servant staying with them for months at a time (I did that shit several times) they wouldn't have felt it necessary.

And no, you cannot bring her to you and you cannot go stay with her or you WILL be letting your brother back into your life to abuse and terrorize you and your family. Do you want him to tell your husband he has you locked up somewhere and won't let you go unless he sends money? Because that is how crazy this man and your mother and your relatives all are. And yes, that is a very real possibility. You should have fled these people long ago and not looked back to the point of disappearing if you had to.\n\nI'm sorry, for your own safety and especially for the safety and sanity of your husband and child and yourself you need to block and delete all of these people. Send one single text, \"I am not going. Do not contact me again.\" Then you block them and if they persist in contact or threaten you get a restraining order.\n\nSpend the time and energy you've wasted on them on the family that deserves your full attention AND in therapy to address any issues until you accept not everyone is born into a wonderful family and sometimes we have to make our own family. \n\nAs a child you had no choice, as an adult you have all the power in the world to make a choice. Choose your husband and your child and your own life and let these people all go. Any contact with your mother and relatives already puts you and your husband and your baby at risk of a dangerous drug addict who has already terrorized you for money in the past and threatened to hurt you. And if you don't think he isn't capable of doing it to your toddler then you really need to reassess your meter of normalcy.\n\nAnd I'm not saying these things to be mean, but you need to wake up and cut these people off, all of them including your mother, because they are a physical threat that goes beyond just a bad relative you feel you have to prove yourself to. These are people who have shown no remorse in hurting you and show no remorse in asking you to hurt your child and husband.

Offer to help her find some in-home care (from a distance!) such as researching services that are local to her.  That's really all you can do.\n\n* The next time a \"caring\" relative crawls out to accuse you of being a bad human being (excuse me while I endlessly *scream* at this), tell them what your mother wants and then sincerely gush, \"I'm so glad that *you're* able to step up and meet her requirements--you have her contact info, right?\"  I'm not kidding. **If it's really that important to them, then they get to demonstrate this through action.**\n\n* In fact, tell them that when they insist that they can't help/it isn't their place to help:  *Tell them that until their actions match their words, you can't take them seriously.*  And then end the conversation.  If that person brings this up again (they will), immediately return to this point:  Ask them what *they* are doing to provide care?  Nothing?  Okay then, it was \"nice\" to talk to you...\n\n* Self-destructive people gonna self-destruct.  I'm sorry about the flippant tone, but it is true.  Take it as an awful lesson about the horrible damage that enabling does to a person.  **Your mother's need to enable outweighs everything else in her life.**  Have you ever watched *Intervention?*  It was on either A&E or AMC a few years back and, yes, it was about springing interventions on addicts.  Well.  In one of the episodes, the mother was so enabling THAT SHE LEFT HOME AND HUSBAND TO LIVE ON THE STREET WITH HER DRUG ADDICT SON.  That's about where your mom is now, OP, and I am heartily sorry for that.\n\n* Boundaries.  Boundaries without guilt.  **You don't owe people things just because you share some DNA.** Don't get into arguments about some great debt you supposedly owe your mother because the arguments are stacked against you.  I mean, \"She changed your diapers!\"  No shit, Sherlock!  And you know what?  She'd have lost custody of you if she didn't get your diapers changed!  Jesus, some people are fucking dense.\n\n* You're good, OP.  You made the reasonable decisions; more than reasonable actually, and your husband sounds like a keeper:  not everyone wants an ailing inlaw moving in, much less disrupt their lives in a particularly stressful way (moving. is. hell).\n\n* You are allowed to not take phone calls and answer messages from people behaving badly.  Avail yourself of that.\n\n* Back to boundaries:  end phone calls whenever the topic comes up.  Your relatives are going to huff and puff and...not be able to blow your house down, for it is made of brink.\n\n* Therapy.  Have you had any?  Now is a good time to start or go back, for enabling is pernicious and you want to make sure that those particular buttons can't be pushed anymore.\n\nETA:  A thought.  How is that your entire extended family \"knows\" that you are \"neglecting\" your mother?  Think about that.  Think about *the underhanded game your mother is playing to force you to submit to her.*  Once again, get some therapy.  **She knows how to push your buttons because SHE INSTALLED THEM.**  Fortunately, with help of therapy you can extirpate those motherfuckers.",

You do not need to take any further action, except to listen to your hubby and delete all those monsters from your life. I am sorry they are awful and so ungrateful. Go no-contact, get a new phone and delete them off fb. Focus on your new family, your inlaws (hope they are kind!), your work and your friends. You sound like a wonderful person and these toxic poison people will take everything and still want more. Saying \u2018no\u2019 now will spare you a lifetime of drama and pain.

            "No is a complete sentence.  \n\n\nYou don't owe your mother anything. You have a child of your own to take care of. You have your child's safety to consider. You have a job. You have a husband. You have your own FAMILY (sorry, you DO have family left with your husband and son, also blood does not necessarily mean family). You've given your mother options.   \n\n\nYou've done your part. I realize it's hard, but it's time to cut all ties. You can't force her to accept the help you can give and have offered to give. Those who are trying to guilt-trip you need to be told to take a seat. I'd explain once, and only once, these are the options you offered her, she refused and there will be no further discussion on the subject.

            "Oh, so many things to unpack here. First of all, your husband and child are your family. Your mother and brother are just the in-laws. Your family comes first, no discussion, end of story.\n\nThat nonsense about \"who cared for you as a baby\" is the worst argument on the face of the Earth. Your mother chose to have you. Therefore, it was her moral, legal, AND ethical responsibility to care for you until you were an adult. It wasn't your decision to be born. Just like how I cannot walk down the street and then ask for an award because I choose not to punch people in the face. That is literally the minimum requirement of being a member of society! If your mother did not care for you as a child, then she would have been arrested and removed. She would have been deemed unfit to be a member of society. So she does not get any points or awards for raising you.\n\nAt the end of the day, you cannot control other people's actions. You can only control your responses. You have begged and pleaded and cried to get your mother to treat you like a basic human being. She is CHOOSING not to do so, and to prioritize your brother over you and your son. Therefore, if you don't prioritize your son, then he will have NO ONE looking out for his best interests. I agree with your husband. You need to learn to set boundaries, and that probably means going low-contact or no-contact with your mother. You set the boundary that your brother can't be in your life, and your mother has chosen to trample that boundary. Therefore, you need to fight for and defend your husband and your son. You need to be the angry mama bear that defends her family at all costs, and that means putting your mother 2nd.\n\nYou need to refuse to JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain) the insane request to shatter your life to go care for your mother. You can be there 100% with empathy. \"Geez mom, that's horrible to hear! I can get on the internet and help find you some support options that you can apply for.\" You need to stop considering buying her a house. You need to rescind your invitation for your mother to be allowed to live with you, because this will just be implicitly allowing her to continue supporting your abuser brother. You need to look out for yourself and your family. The problem is that with people like your mother and brother, you are correct that both are being enabled. It is because what they are asking for, and what they need are 2 different things. You need to allow your mother to fall, and to experience the consequence of blindly supporting your brother. That means that her life will become harder when she is spending her money on him. You cannot be there to catch her. You can be there to advise her how to find food and housing when her life is destroyed from her self-destructive actions. Similarly, until your brother hits rock bottom he will never get better. And he will never get better as long as your mother knows that she can continue to steamroll your boundaries without consequence. If she ever moved in with you, it is GUARANTEED that your brother would end up being invited into your home. And I don't care if it's because \"the devil is in him,\" that doesn't make the risk of domestic violence, or transmitting hepatitis, or any of the other risks any less real. Being pushed down the stairs is being pushed down the stairs, along with the danger of severe injury, regardless of the reasons or excuses behind that action.\n\nIf your mother doesn't want home care, then she doesn't want home care. That isn't your problem, and you cannot light yourself on fire to keep her warm. She can help herself, or learn that actions have consequences. Please please please please don't let her move in with you. Do not bend over and try to buy a bigger home or build an add-on suite. Again, that would destroy your life.",

You are your own person, and don't you ever forget that. \n\nBtw, even if your mother agreed to move in with you, you have no certainty that your brother wouldn't end up in your home so all in all I think you're safer this way. \nIf she doesn't want a nurse at home and doesn't want to move in with you, you should consider she might need to live in a retirement home, even if she doesn't want to. She appears not to be in the best position to make decisions (given how she ignores the doctor's orders). \n\nSorry for being so blunt but I've had plenty of family drama in my life and I get to mad reading how they're treating you. You don't need to keep them in your life just because they have the same last name ot genetics. \ud83d\udc99",
            "It really sucks, but I\u2019d also recommend going No Contact with your non-household family. The way I see it, your mother and the rest of your extended family, aside from just treating you like shit and taking advantage of you, are actively putting you and your baby and husband in danger by continuing to allow your brother with a history of violence contact opportunities. You don\u2019t owe your mother anything just because she birthed you. \n\nI had to learn really early that family is what we make of it. Sometimes (in my case, a lot of the time) that means cutting off people. Blood relation doesn\u2019t mean anything\u2014not really. Especially when it\u2019s preventing you from being happy. If your mother refuses to be helped in a way that will also be healthy for you, then, in my eyes, your hands are clean. You tried and she didn\u2019t accept your help. I would personally wash my hands of the situation before it escalates.",
            "Your family is so god danm toxic.",
            "You can\u2019t help someone that won\u2019t help themselves. If your mom is not going to move, screw it. We moved my grandma into town and my mother cared for her until her last days. Going as far as having hospice set up in her living room. Grandma loved being closer to us. That being said, my mom wouldn\u2019t have moved to grandma. Put those big girl pants on and put your foot down.",

            "TL but I read enough to ask you 2 questions:\n1. Do you want to forfeit your one and only life?\nA: I hope the answer is NO, no I do not. \n\n2. More of a statement- pay someone else to provide care for them both. Crowd source or whatever- I will read more carefully.",
            "I had time to read through this whole thing finally.\n\nIf she can not care for herself, Adult Protective Services is an option.\n\nAs for the guilt from others. Screw em. They are honestly talking from a place of fear and guilt, and are looking for someone else who they feel should feel more guilty. I have gotten this from my family as well. Now that she has an open case with APS, there is actually a lot of weight off our shoulders. There are subs here r/agingparents and another one someone referred me to.\n\nHonestly this experience has been so hard. Losing your independence is hard and scary and most of them fight you like a feral cat. Noone who hasn't been through it can understand both the horrible guilt you feel and your innate instinct to self preserve and walk away. There are lots and lots of services to help you. Just talking to a social worker at APS has made me feel ten years younger. You are not alone. Thousands of people are dealing with this. Don't let her selfishness and fear destroy your life.\n\nOne person offered me advice to contact the senior services treating it as if she was someone who didn't have family. Step away from the personal stuff. What would you want for any human being? \n\nFinally, she has a right to live this way. She is making it day to day. I will say that had I dealt with this six months ago we would be in a better place. My mom became unable to care for herself and less mobile which led to an unhealthy living situation. Sometimes someone else telling them they need help goes over better.\n\nGood luck. Feel free to PM me with questions or just to chat. I am older than you, but I totally get the pain.",
            "Have you considered seeking guardians ship over your mother and moving her into assisted living. She's clearly unable to care for herself.\n\nI would consider contacting the adult protective services hotline for her area and speaking with them about the situation. Your brother has been committing elder abuse and it needs to be stopped.",
            "I\u2019ve stopped talking to family members over them not passing the mash potatoes at dinner.  You\u2019re a better person than me.  I would have cut both of them out of my life awhile back.  You have given her options.  Sounds like both your brother and mother are jealous of your life and want to suck you into the shit life they have had to live.  You know Eskimos would push their elders off on the ice in old age.",
            "You come from a seriously dysfunctional family, and I'm sorry for you. However, you are a product of that dysfunction, hence your utter lack of compassion for either your mother or your brother. The latter sounds horrific, but do you think he can just choose to control his addiction? I'm betting he has a rather serious, longstanding, undiagnosed mental illness--and the drugs were his way of self-medicating. That is very often the case. He can't cure himself. \n\nIt's a shame the family didn't help him years ago, but I'm glad at least that your mother still has enough love for him that nothing will stop it. She's damaged and he's damaged. Don't try to take away the last bit of love he has in the world. You already have so much more than he does--a significant other, a child, a career. Just go about your life and forget mom if you can't bear her loving your brother. I don't blame you for not wanting him around your son, but I think it's pretty crummy of you to want to make your brother's life even more horrible than it already is and has been.",
            "First and foremost, you're covered by FMLA if you take time off to deal with your mom.\n\nSecondly, it sounds like your mother doesn't have the mental capacity to care for herself (mostly likely part of her illness so take it easy on her). You probably need to become her guardian. Either willingly or unwillingly on her part. \n\nMoving her to a facility nearby seems like the only option at this point. You can't just wash your hands of the situation. \n\nIgnore the random people who are talking crap. Unless of course one of these people are volunteering their home and 24/7 caregiving skills.\n\nYou do have an obligation to care for and protect your mother but, it should be on your terms.",
