        "selftext": "Link to original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nsbhlr/my_36m_family_is_upset_im_prioritizing_my_bil/)\n\nFirstly, thank you everyone for your comments, messages, insights and support. It really helped me strengthen my resolve and find solace in what I was doing. I'll address a few concerns/questions that popped up before my mini-update.\n\nYes, Bill knows Jane is his. When Tom got his paternity test done, he and Bill had him go separately to be tested.\n\nWhy am I letting Tom stay with me? Well..he was family for years and for me, you don't just chuck family onto the streets except for extreme situations. Divorce takes a year in my state and Tom is opting to stay to make sure it can all be handled quickly and smoothly to get it finalized as soon as possible. That said, he plans on moving back to his homestate after that so I am letting him stay with me so he can save money for his move and moving expenses. Otherwise, the only places he could afford on his own require 6 and 12 month leases.\n\nSupporting Tom and Bill may result in my sister and I having little to no contact. True, it may, and that'll be our crosses to bear but I can't find it in me to ignore others needing help just to satiate her and excuse her behavior. I still love my sister, whatever my feelings or opinions of what she did or is doing have no place in this, nor is it really the time for me to go expressing them to her. Bill's lawyer says its very likely Bill will wind up with a custody arrangement and he has assured me that if things do go south with my sister that she won't let me see my niece, I'd always be welcome to visit them to see her during his time with her.\n\nNow for the update..its not a huge one but rather surprising. My sister is still being cranky and doubling down, doing all she can to guilt Tom into reconciling and adamant about Bill not being involved because 'she has a husband that just needs to realize they can work through this, Tom is Jane's dad and Bill is not needed'. So..meh there. Last week I went on a fishing trip with both Tom and Bill for the three of us to just relax and forget all this nonsense for a bit. Once we got back my mother showed up to try talking to me about why I am doing any of this.\n\nSurprisingly, we had a decent talk after some heated tension. I wound up showing her the post and while she wasn't happy I was airing our laundry, it helped a bit. Ultimately I was able to get it through to her that given the circumstances and the high probability Bill is going to be a presence in Jane's life from here on out, the best thing for Jane would be if our family and Bill could at least co-exist. I asked her how she would feel if her granddaughter was constantly having to choose who to spend time with for birthdays, graduation, prom pictures, etc, or gods forbid, we all put her in a position that she would have to lie to everyone about what she wanted just to not hurt feelings. It took a while but that seemed to at least get through to her a bit. She's still not happy about the whole situation, but she did agree to a dinner in a public place to meet Bill and some of his family and I'm happy to say that that wound up going off really well and Bill's mother had a good heart to heart with her. So, some progress. Thanks again everyone for the support.\n\nTLDR: My sister is still trying to pressure my BIL into reconciling and mad at me for supporting BIL and her daughter's father, but my mother is at least making some progress towards accepting my niece's biological father.",

            "Damn. \n\nSo your sister lied to both of these men for years and now expects them and everyone else to bend to her will? It sounds like you, Tom, and Bill have Jane's best interests in mind more your sister or parents do. \n\nKudos to you for doing the right thing.",
            "I'm still surprised anyone is listening to your sister.    \n\nShe married Tom, cheated on him with Bill and became pregnant (unbeknownst to Bill), and then decided Tom was who she wanted to be the father. She doesn't get to decide that ffs. If I were Tom I'd skedaddle too, and the fact that Bill contacted them to stand up and be a father speaks to his character. Maybe it will rub off on your sister.     \n\nYou are a great person OP. You actually seek harmony and what is best for Jane. She is lucky to have you :)",
            "Are Bill and Tom going to slowly transition father roles so Jane doesn\u2019t end up with abandonment issues ? Maybe they can slowly pull Tom out of her life if he played a big role and then get Bill in there full time so she can have a bond with him",
            "OP, you truly are a stellar human being.\n\nIf you are not a counselor or mediator, you should probably look into it as an alternative career.  Just amazing how you brought everyone together.\n\nHugs to you.",
            "As far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019re doing everything right. Helping out Tom and Bill is a good choice. Good job.",
            "The mental gymnastics by your sister and anyone who supports her reasoning and way of thinking makes my head hurt.\n\nProps to you though my man. You are an amazing person and are 100% doing the right thing.",
            "I totally support your decision. My brother cheated on his wife/ left her for a 19 year old. I supported her after. I wasn't mean to him, he is still my brother, and I understand we all make mistakes. But she is the Aunt to my children. They all know and love her. She had every intention of being married to him forever and was a good wife. She was a great friend and sister in law. She's STILL a great friend. I was recently a bridesmaid (just me and her sister) in her (very small) wedding. My family luckily agreed. My brother made a vow, promised to love her and be loyal. HE brought her into the family and promised it was now hers as well. We all took that seriously.",
            "How is Jane doing in all of this? It must be hard when your dad disappears one day. Is she ok with it?",
            "Anyone else really confused that he called his BIL Tom and the other guy... Bill.",
            "Her actions caused this, not your reaction. I still talk to my ex BIL even though my sister didn't want me to. That's not her call to make.",
            "OP, you are very admirable. You are doing the right thing and it is obvious that you, Tom, and Bill care more for your niece than your sister. You really make me hopeful for the human race. \n\nYour BIL, Tom, how is he taking all if this?\n\nThe three of you went fishing, so obviously Tom is okay with Bill now.  What were Tom's feelings about Bill when Bill first contacted him?  I try to think what I would think in Bill's place. If there had been no signs, clues, or red flags about my wife cheating I suppose I would not believe Bill at first.\n\nAlso your sister didn't tell Bill she was married when they began the affair? So Bill just thought she was a regular GF and only broke it off because he had to move away? \n\nI guess Bill thinks that he must have dodged a bullet. \n\nMan Tom will be totally left out of this when he moves to his home state. Does he have any friends or family there that can be a support network for him? \n\nAlso how long were your sister and tom been together, dating and marriage?",
            "Did I miss it or did noone mentions TOMS family? Like they were grandparents and ( possibly uncle's aunt's) now all of a sudden nope! Not ! How sad for all involved - bills parents were mentioned but they gained a grandaughter ....",
            "You're doing wonderful. You're helping both Bill and Tom through a time that could have been far darker.\n\nYour sister is being quite entitled. She cannot dictate what Jane, Tom, Bill or you do.\n\nI hope Bill sues for full custody and settled for joint. Your sister sounds controlling and manipulative. What matters is not just what she wants but what all parties concerned want.",
            "I hope Tom doesn't fall, he needs to get rid of the snake that is his sister.\n\nBill really has a right to be close to his daughter.",
            "Jesus Christ poor Tom. I\u2019ve seen similar stories from other \u201cToms\u201d and I gotta say, they\u2019re scarred for life. To raise a child with your wife and suddenly realize that everything was a lie; she\u2019s not yours and your wife has been cheating all along. I can\u2019t judge anyone for whatever they decide to do after that. You\u2019re a wonderful guy for helping him out at the worst point in his life and bringing everyone together",
            "Cheating sucks.\n\nYou sister hasn't earnt anything but expects everything. If anything she owes a lot to the people around her for how she's treated them. \n\nYou're not betraying her at all. You're allowed to disagree with your family. \n\nYou're not doing anything wrong buddy. \n\nPeople need to learn that actions have consequences. She might have an underlying issue causing her to act out or seek attention elsewhere but she needs to make the effort to accept the consequesnces of her actions before she deserves any support.",
            "Honestly I've been here with my siblings before. My brother cheated on his wife, I knew and she didn't. She was one of my best friends, but I would have told her even if we weren't close. He hasn't really talked to me since they divorced and her and I are still friends. \n\nAnother brother is verbally, mentally, and emotionally abusive to his SO and kids. I have helped get her out of his house when they wanted to leave and she didn't have a way to leave. They are still together because it's very hard to really leave an abusive relationship and him and I only talk because i want to make sure I'm \"allowed\" to be there for my SIL and their kids bc she is isolated from everyone else who could help her if she ever decides to really leave. \n\nIn these situations and in yours, we know what's right and are willing to do that regardless of what other people who want to enable negative behaviors might thing, and there is power in being able to stand up for what you know is right. I know family is hard especially when they're in the wrong and you stand against it. But it's worth it because the victims in these situations deserve better.",
            "Poor Jane\n\nAt least your families seem to be working through this with love, your sister notwithstanding.  \n\nBut poor Jane :(",
            "You're doing the right thing, even in your first post with supporting Tom. Your sister needs to get it through her head that Jane is not Tom's daughter.",
            "Man, you, Tom and Bill should try for custody of Jane and your sister can go kick rocks. 3 men and a baby style. Jane'll have multiple family groups, 3 dads who get along for co-parenting and love her very much, and a mom who's around sometimes I guess.   \nAll jokes aside, it's awesome you're stepping in to help facilitate a setup that'll hopefully work out well for the kid. Nobody deserves to be stuck in the situation you were in and you're doing what you can to help keep that from repeating.  Helping out Tom, allowing Bill in, and helping the family overall cope with the situation instead of hurting a little kid for the rest of her life just to appease some social expectations. Your sister needs to get on the same page as to what's good for everyone involved, not just what she wants. Good luck on that bit.",
            "Wait, maybe I missed this part somewhere. Is Tom still planning on being in Jane\u2019s life after he and your sister get divorced?",
            "Youre a profoundly good person. Your sister, however, is not.",
            "You are an angel, seriously. You took your experience on this earth and used it to help another person have it better. Not everyone does that, but you did, and that makes you an amazing human. Your niece may not ever know what you did for her, but in my eyes it\u2019s a huge deal that made her future brighter. Thank you for being you.",
            "Keep fighting the good fight, OP! You\u2019re walking the right path, keep going.",
            "Thank you for sharing this update. It sounds like your niece is blessed with you, a caring uncle and a  father  that definitely  supports you maintaining your relationship with your niece.\nI really admire your efforts to read all the comments, including mine that were blunt, and working through the complexity of this situation. \nAll the best",
            "There are good people on this planet and OP, you are one of them.\n\nIt's heartening to me when I come across them.",
            "IMO, you\u2019re doing the right thing. Your sister is being unfair to her daughter & your BIL. He\u2019s the only father she has known so I\u2019m sure she can\u2019t understand why her mom is keeping her away from him & you. I don\u2019t understand why Tom is dealing with Bill but that\u2019s his choice. It\u2019s good that Bill wants to be in his child\u2019s life. If I were Tom, I\u2019d head back home & give Bill no fight to remove my name off the birth certificate. Your sister is dead wrong. Your family is too IMO. But that can be resolved if/when Tom goes back to his hometown.",

It's so much better when different families get along together. You should be proud of yourself, you're in a tough spot but you're doing awesome work",
            "oh yeah how could you choose the victim over anyone else? /s i mean only an evil person would do that /s\n\n\nscrew the lot of them",

            "OP, are you married or in a relationship? If so what does your SO think of this situation?",
            "I had something similar happen to me and my ex wife. She had an affair while we were married and ended up pregnant. For a year, I raised my daughter thinking I was the bio father. After finding out the truth, the hard way, we separated and eventually divorced. Fast forward a couple years to when I went for custody for all my daughters, and I was granted custody of three girls under the age of 5. After that proceeding, I adopted the youngest daughter and raised her as my own. \n\nI am not the expert in this situation, but if the two men have a relationship to raise this daughter, I pray for the best. This young lady will benefit from both guys being involved in her life. Sorry the rest of your families are being cows",
            "It seems like everything they\u2019re doing is ultimately in support of your niece and out of empathy from having gone through a situation similar to hers.",
            "You\u2019re doing the right thing!!! Don\u2019t let their petty and bitter energy knock you down! They all know they are wrong. Women being women they\u2019re stubborn. You\u2019re doing well OP good for you and your niece. She\u2019s lucky to have someone like you fighting for her!!!",
            "I'm happy Tom is so CCC (Cool, Calm and Collected) about this. Once someone does something like this to you, a lot of hate, rage and sadness comes boiling out. \n\nDespite his broken heart he's doing what he can to move quickly through this without any mess.\n\nI commend Bill for stepping in and actually trying to take care of his child. Most guys would go \"whew dodged a bullet\" and let the lie continue for the rest of their life. He's inviting a boat load of responsibility cost free.  While it should be standard for everyone, it's not and so props to him\n\nAnd last but not least props to you for doing the right thing. This whole shit-uation could have been a lot worse without everyone's efforts \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f",
            "tell her to shut up, she's a disgusting woman and cheating and hiding the baby in unjustifiable you do you my guy and good luck (i hope u dont get mad at me for saying that abt ur sis because it looks like u still love her)",
            "Am I the only one starting to suspect that the parents are responsible for raising such an entitled and obviously sociopathic child amd deserve partial blame for her actions?\n\nAfter hearing how OP's step dad treated OP when he tried to become closer to his other family, these people sound really toxic and dont understand what \"family\" really means",
            "It\u2019s so painfully obvious how immature and selfish someone is when they not only fuck up so big (this is a character defect btw she actively chose to maintain a cheating relationship - disgusting), but then to *tell* the one hurt they can just get over it and move on lmao. Your sister deserves the harshest reality slap in the world, and only after you see the gravity of this set into her eyes, then pull the rug out and tell her she can carry this alone for the rest of her life.\n\nBill deserves Jane and likewise. But if Tom can\u2019t be around her.. then although that sucks, I understand. And maybe with her being so young she won\u2019t be affected or remember him much. But 20 years from now when she\u2019s told about all this, man her mom is gonna be in trouble all over again. She really done goofed.",
            "Your sister is trying to minimise the extreme damage she has caused and instead of trying to be sensitive, admit what she did to herself and everyone else she wants nothing to change. She wants to use all of her social sway in the family to make that happen. She wants to guilt Tom into doing something that is not in his own interest. She wants her family onside to support her in that. It's selfish. I guess it's like if you commit a crime and try to cover it up. She's desperately hoping to hide it, hoping it can all just be made better somehow. Reality isn't hitting her yet, probably because she lived a lie so long. She's deluded but hopefully, she will come to her senses. \n\nYou're involved in this, that would be my worry. Very involved. Because something similar happened to you, helping the situation is helping you work through your own trauma. Be very careful with that because seeing things through the lens of our trauma can cause us to lose perspective. And losing perspective here could make you lose out on family. So I think being very clear and knowing your boundaries is important. \n\nHaving said that I believe you are doing the right thing for Bill and Tom and your niece. For your family. You're just not feeding into the narrative that what your sister did doesn't change things - it does. You've spoken to your mother and the reality that Bill will be a part of their lives is sinking in for her. But she probably still needs to see, and your sister maybe needs to hear, that you love her. That you doing this doesn't mean that you love Tom more, essentially. You think her thinking and actions around this were wrong and you know she is hurting and her life is falling apart right now. By doing what you are doing, you are having her back. You're not stopping Tom from coming back to her but the reality is, he is divorcing her, he has good reason and she needs to accept that. And when she looks back at the situation with some hindsight in the future you think she will be happier and feel better about what happened and how your family conducted itself in a crisis. She can do as she sees fit and you don't want to judge her. But abandoning Tom when he needs some help is what your conscience dictates. \n\nI'd say aswel, make sure and take care of yourself. You're helping Tom but you need to show your family that your loyalty is to all of them - not just your sister. You're trying to accept reality and do the right thing. Your sister is not accepting reality at the moment - but some day she will have to. And you'd be there for her if a situation like this ever arose and her partner had cheated. The damage is done and you're just trying to minimise the pain to everyone from the fallout.\n\nIt's a lot to get across to your family. But long run you're doing what's right for your niece and ultimately, your sister. You also need to do what's right for you so when the time comes and your sister and family need to accept Bill that they trust you too. And some honesty without judgement might get you there. \n\nYou're a good person, and what you're doing is sweet but above all else avoid trauma bonding and being seen as the saviour in all of this. It's not your drama. You're just picking Tom up and dusting him off and sending him on his way. Same with Bill, you're creating a bit of a tendril but he will have to build the branches. Don't be too involved in the creation of that relationship. A voice of reason or somewhere to shelter from a storm. You can't side with anyone here.",
            "OP, you are a saint of saints. You are also some god level mediator to get Tom and Bill to reconcile. I know your sister is the primary cause of a lot of drama, and it takes two to tango, but I would be hard pressed to have any kind of relationship with the other guy if I was Bill OR Tom.\n\nHang in there, OP. You have made awesome progress and no matter what is said seem to be really trying to give Jane the best life she can have given the circumstances. I wish you the best.",
            "Bio dad didn't even know about Jane.  Your sister is awful and you are doing the right thing.  Glad mom is seeing the truth and realizing Bill isn't going anywhere and he's a good guy, and so is Tom.  Poor Tom, imagine, raising what you thought was your daughter, with your faithful wife...then WHAMO...Tom needs to do what's best for Tom and glad you are there for him!  \n\nSounds like the beginning of the 3 amigos!  A blossoming friendship...amazing how much good can grow from something that started as \"bad\".",
            "You have a very good heart sir and both Bill and Tom have found a very dear lifelong friend in you. Standing up to family is hard but you are siding on the side of good and right as opposed to obligation and bitterness. Sending best wishes to all your family",
            "Frankly, your sister is a terrible person, she hurt a man who did not deserve it, her own husband, and committed adultery. Nobody should be acting like this is OK. A family that enables this is just as bad as the adulteress. How'd you end up being the only one with any morals and ethics?\n\nI think Bill should be encouraged to seek 50/50 custody and be a father to his daughter. I hope you spend more time with your biological family and I can only think that that's where you got your good ethics. I'm sorry your family, especially your sister, are such terrible people, I imagine it can be tough to do the right thing when you have people who were so close to you trying to pressure you into doing the absolutely wrong thing.",
            "Nothing like a heaping amount of entitlement piled on top of infidelity and paternity fraud. Yikes.   \n\n\nInitially reading this I felt you may be a little \"too close\" to all the parties involved, but after some careful thought, no - it's definitely a good thing there's someone who's familiar with all involved (maybe to a lesser extent with Bill) in there advocating for the actual victims of your sister's actions. A judge may not handle things quite the way is best for all (but your sister) involved. Someone NEEDS to advocate for these victims, and it seems like you're doing just that, good job sir.  \n\n\nThe birth cert and Bill wanting to take on the father role needs to be documented, heavily. Otherwise, your sister WILL seek child support from Tom, and because he's on the cert and has been around for 3 years, she will probably be awarded the support from him - that paperwork needs to get fixed - ASAP.",
            "OP, you are right in supporting both Bill and Tom. Your sister is upset because things are not working out the way she wants them to be. Too bad. She is the one that caused all of this to happen. Sounds like she has some mental/ emotional issues that would require professional help.",
            "why does your sister want tom to stay married to her? does she get something like insurance from the army cuz tom is a vet? cuz its obvious she isnt in love with him cuz its one thing to cheat, but then to lie to a man and tell him he is the father??? no way could anyone do that to sum1 they love. maybe she just doesnt want the divorce stigma. i wonder how many more dudes she banged. i dated 2 bartenders. both of thems dads owned the bar. if ur woman is hott and a bartender ur relationship will be a nightmare"

I think this will also be an excellent turning point for you into your adult life with your husband and any kids you may raise to have firm boundaries with him and redefine the role he can play (read: extremely minimal).\n\nYour TLDR says it all.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone. Sorry for not posting an update, I have quite a few messages asking me how I'm doing, so I thought I'd post here on what's going on. \n\nI realised people were trying to figure out where I came from, since the dialect or the tone of my writing is a bit off. I actually have a bit of a learning disability, so my partner comes on and sort of corrects things for me. \n\nThe original post is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2xpni7/\n\nWell, we ended up having to move, which is no problem to be honest. It was the safer route for our little family that's growing. We also installed extra security and have contacted police, schools, neighbours, etc. I'll tell you the story. \n\nFirst of all, I'm just going to say that I stopped talking to my sister. She's acting as if she did nothing wrong, but she knows what she did.\n\nSo about a month and a half ago, we had already started packing, since we were moving away. My dad texted me and asked if I wanted to meet up, just myself. I said no at first, because I knew that he was going to try and yell at me again for not giving him any money, as well as my grandma. (I looked into /r/raisedbynarcissists that was suggested by some people since he tries to gaslight me a lot.) He then ended up writing an email and apologised for everything he had said and done on his and grandma's behalf. I was actually surprised my dad was apologising for the first time in his life. He then asked if we could meet again, so I caved in and met him. We went to a cafe and I had a really nice time talking to him, yet I felt a bit off. We were probably sitting there talking for about an hour. He was checking his phone a lot. \n\nAfter we left, I went straight home (my partner had our son with him) and found that the property we were living in at the time had been broken into. I realised at that point that dad used me as a sort of.. decoy or something. I called the police immediately and told them that we have secret installation and camera's, so we'l be able to see who did what and when. They scanned the house with a German Shepard dog, and had an inspection and investigation. Meanwhile, I contacted my partner and then went down to the police station with them. They started watching the videos, and behold, it was my own fucking grandmother. I guess she doesn't need that knee surgery then.. I asked the officers what I could do and like many suggested in the first post, they suggested a restraining order, specifically a protection order straight away.  I had the evidence. I was so round up, I just wanted to call my dad and fucking yell at him because I knew he and grandma planned this together. I decided not to because that could jeopardise things in court. They ended up stealing my jewellery and my partner's oculus. (no idea why..) I told my partner to store it away properly, but he didn't. The police officer asked me why I didn't want to press charges on them for slashing my tires and stealing my mail. I said I had the benefit of the doubt about them, but I was wrong..\n\nThe police found my grandmother and father around my property and arrested them. They were standing there pretending to be worried and sad that the house was broken into. My dad went to trial. He couldn't afford a lawyer so he had a public defender. My father is to be sentenced to 4 years in prison for robbing our house. I ended up finding out that he did a home invasion many years ago, went to prison and then came out and flew to his home country after his parole ended. I was taken back by all of this. My grandma is currently in hospital, because she actually did hurt her knee and leg from breaking into our house.\n\n At least right now, I have a protection order against them. They cannot come near me or my family, or the property. \n\nAs for my partner and my son, I apologised to him and said I shouldn't have met my dad. He understood and just said that it's normal to crave love. I'm really honestly heartbroken that my family would do this to me, but at least we've moved into a better property, I can get the therapy I need and I can focus on my new family.\n\nThanks for reading. \n\nEDIT: Thanks for the support guys. I really appreciate it. \n\n   \n**tl;dr**: family apologises, meets me, breaks and steals stuff in my house and tries to act scared when they see the house has been broken into",

They moved in with us and for the indefinite future this situation will not change.\n\nWe have a 3 bedroom house and before they moved in, my dad and I had our rooms (both with bathrooms) and there was a smaller room which was a study for my dad. After they moved in, Jenny [16F, turning 17 next month] got my room, and I had to share the smaller room with Tom [11M] and Mike [10M]. All my books, my telescope, my stuff are packed and in the basement now since there's no space anymore. This made me real angry but my dad told me that I have to be a team player and this is what him and his wife agreed on.\n\nJenny treats me like shit. She sometimes acts as if I'm not there at all, and sometimes is super aggressive and hostile towards me. The other I asked Tom to stop going through my things and she became so angry that \"I have no right to order her brother around\", she told me to get it in my thick scull that I'm not their big brother to tell them what to do, even though all I asked was for them to stop going through my things. She said it's best if I don't talk to them at all since that way they will get less influence from a weirdo like me. What I don't get is that if she's so concerned that I might leave a bad influence on Tom and Mike why doesn't she take them into her room?\n\nTom and Mike don't respect any boundaries. They're always through my stuff. I have a watch which was a gift from my mother (she died of cancer) and they took it from my drawer and lost it. I found it weeks later in the basement with its front glass broken. \n\nBefore they moved in I used to get a $100 allowance every month. Now Jenny gets $75, I get $35 and Tom and Mike each get $30. I had an Xbox but these kids broke it down.\n\nI used to spend a lot of time with my dad. He used to come see me play basketball almost every week, he hasn't done it even once in the past three months since he's always working overtime. We eat out once a week and none of them in these three months have been to any of my favorite places, but Jenny, Tom and Mike have each chosen their favorites more than once. \n\nI complained about all of it to my father last week and he told me that family is all about sacrifices, and I have to make mine. Haven't I made enough sacrifices already? I feel like I'm the only one making sacrifices. I looked forward to them moving in here but I now feel like an outsider at home, it's not my home anymore.\n\nLife has become very difficult for me. I spend as much time as I can outside because inside is so frustrating but this is causing problems as well. My dad keeps telling me that not being around means I'm not accepting them as part of the family while in reality it's the opposite. So I get grounded for not being around, and being around is horrible. \n\nI don't want to live here anymore but I'm only 15 and can't move out. I have nobody else who can take me in. I can't stay here for 3 more years. I'll go crazy. I often fantasize about running away at night but I know that's also as horrible if not even more.\n\nI don't know what to do. Can anyone give me a suggestion?\n\n**tl;dr**: Father remarried and his wife and three kids moved in. They've taken over my room, my things, my space, my budget and treat me horribly.

Tell him everything about Jenny's behavior, how they constantly break things of yours without consequences (watch from mother, Xbox, all that), that you feel like you don't get as much time together, like your opinions matter less in dinner/everything else- I really don't see how any dad could ground you after understanding why you're out of the house so much.

Why don't you have my back on these things?\"\n\nAnother general tip for talking to **everyone** about these things is to use the \"When you... I feel... will you.\" pattern.  It keeps you from saying something that they can attack you for, because you focus on **specific behaviors** and how those behaviors make *you feel*.  You don't get into motivations or anything that will make them feel defensive, or give them a chance to deflect:\n\n\"<brothers>, when you go through my stuff I feel anxious that you're going to break something, the way you broke my mother's watch. Will you stop touching my things?\"\n\nIf they don't stop - talk to BOTH of your parents:\n\n\"<parents>, I've asked them to stop going through my things, and they don't.  Can you please make them stop.\"\n\n\"<parents>, when you ignore my reasonable requests, I feel like you don't care about me.  Will you tell me why you're not helping me set reasonable boundaries and ground-rules?\"\n\nIt's not magic, but it can help focus conversations.\n\nGood luck!",

            "Your dad is not really listening or seeing how he is bungling the merging of two families.\n\nHere's what you can try to address immediately:\n\n*  Ask your dad if he can make up a rotating schedule to post on the refrigerator of who gets to choose where to eat out.

Let him know you miss his presence and feel lonely and left out and miss the one on one time you used to have.\n\n*  Talk to your dad one on one on a daily basis.  Ask him if he has 15 minutes he can give to you daily so you can talk about anything and everything.  \n\n*  Ask your dad if you can have a private space/time for you to do private things.\n\nHere's what you can try with your step-siblings:\n\n*  If Jenny brings up you talking or chastising Tom and Mike again, don't get into an argument with her.  State that you have a right to not have your stuff messed with and then close your door or walk away.  This one is hard; but while you don't give in, you also don't want to engage with her.\n\n*  Tom and Mike are unfortunately at the ages where they will go through your stuff.  You can make it fun for all by showing them what things they can play with and what they can't.  And of the items they can't, put them in a locked container that you buy (sorry) with your allowance.\n\nThings that you're going to have to let go:\n\n*  The allowance reduction and the unfairness of the split.\n\n*  The 3 kids to one room thing.  \n\nWhat you can do for yourself:\n\n*  See if you can find a part-time job.  Driving age is coming up and you're going to want to have cash to buy a vehicle and pay for gas and insurance.\n\n*  Take time with Tom and Mike and play basketball with them.  Getting along better does mean you all have to get to know each other.  If you can do it while doing something you like to do, it's easier.\n\n*  Not much you can do with Jenny.  Be polite though.\n\nIf you have any aunts/uncles on either side of your dad or mom to talk with, hit them up. Or your guidance counselor at school.  It really does help to talk all this out face to face with someone.",
            "I'll tell you exactly what to do. Study hard in school, get yourself a full academic scholarship and move out in a few years when you graduate. Your dad probably has self worth issues, married to not be alone and unfortunatley anything you say will glance off him right now because his hands are tied.",
            "I wish someone would tell your dad that just because he's fucking some lady and married her, does not make her kids your family. You are sacrificing for his benefit, none of your own.\n\nMy only advice is to ask your father why one person gets the big room and three people have to share the little one. Ask him why you had to make all these sacrifices but none of her children did. Ask him why it's alright for these other kids to break gifts from your dead mother. Ask your father when he decided that his sex life was more important that his only child who lost his only mother. Tell him you dream about running away, that you think at this point a life of surfing couches seems more appealing than this life. Tell him he has created a situation where all his only son thinks about is how soon he can escape and never look back.\n\nDrop a giant honesty bomb.\n\nAnd make sure to write everything you want to say down. Read it out to him. That way he a)knows you thought about it and aren't shooting from the hip, and b) if he interrupts you, you can pick right back up where you left off.",

She really is the problem. You need to make it very clear to your father that it is not acceptable. Have a grown up discussion, sit him down and tell him everything that is going on. You haven't said anything about your new step mother? If you have a decent relationship with her you could also tell her what her kids are doing since they probably aren't comfortable correcting each others kids. You are very patient but if you don't play it smart it will only bite you in the ass and it will only get worse. Best of luck! \nI'm sorry for your loss OP",
            "If I were you, I wouldn't do any of the things recommended here. I know you are only 15, but 15 is one year from being able to get a driver's license. It's time for you to start maneuvering to leave home.\n\nFirstly, is there any restaurant within walking distance of your house? If so, express to your father that you are going to try to get a job washing dishes, busing tables, whatever. No restaurants/diners? Try retail places, some of them don't mind hiring kids for simple tasks as well. If you get a job, you will be able to have significantly less time at home without being grounded for it.\n\nOpen your OWN bank account WITH NOBODY ELSE'S NAME ON IT (!!) and deposit your checks. Save, save, save. Put your new allowance (sucks dude, I'm sorry) in there too. Bide your time, work as many hours as you can while still getting your homework done.\n\nWithin a couple years, you'll be able to afford a car, get a license, and make yourself scarce. At 17/18, fill out your FAFSA, take out loans, and get the fuck out for school. Community college might be a fabulous option, it's cheaper, so you could allocate loan money to a cheap apartment. Do your prerequisite courses there and then transfer to a bigger university. Living off of loans sucks, it will be hard in the future when you have to pay them back... but it will be infinitely better than living with your doormat dad, evil stepmom, and her bitch kids.\n\nGood luck kid. I know you're super young, but honestly 16 is when I started to really do my own thing and make myself scarce anyway. Time to grow up and get out of there, because nobody is looking out for your best interests at home.",
            "OP, that really stinks and I'm sorry you're dealing with all of this.\n\nMy suggestion would be to write down this post in a letter to give to your dad. It is possible that he was not listening the first time you tried to tell him all this stuff, or that he interrupted you or didnt understand. A letter will make sure you can express all of your thoughts and feelings without your dad having the opportunity to interrupt.\n\nYou dont talk about your step mother in this post a whole lot. What is your relationship with her like? If she has been kind to you and seems like a good person, maybe consider giving her a letter that expresses your thoughts and feelings as well. It's possible that she has no idea you are feeling so uncomfortable and frustrated. \n\nBeyond this, do you have a school counselor or teacher, relative or adult in your life that you could talk to about this situation? Sometimes it really helps to talk out loud about your frustrations to someone who will really listen and can offer another perspective and good advice.\n\nAlso: Family counseling. Ask your dad about going to see a family counselor, because it could only help your situation. A (good) family counselor would act as an unbiased third party mediator, and would help you guys communicate your frustrations and feelings to each other, and hopefully help you work through problems and negotiate fairer treatment for all kids.\n\nIf family counseling is out of the question, maybe ask to see a counselor or therapist that specializes in the merging of two families with kids. That kind of person will be able to help you better than anyone else on reddit can.",
            "I am half fuming reading this. I am going to talk out of my ass for most of this post, but this is what I believe every human have a right to.\n\n>  This made me real angry but my dad told me that I have to be a team player and this is what **him and his wife** agreed on.\n\nNononono, you do not have to be a team player here, if they did not deem it necessary to include you in the plan you have every right to oppose it. Seriously, they want you to just accept whatever crap they throw at you, just because they made a plan? \"Sorry son, the plan says we do not have to take your view into consideration, sorry, hands tied!.\" Utter bollocks, as a 15 year old and a member of the family you have every right to be included in this discussion *before* they made any decisions. Hell, any child should have the decent human right to be included in what they expect/should be expected with a new family. If they did not include you in the planning, you have no obligation to follow that plan.\n\n> I complained about all of it to my father last week and he told me that family is all about sacrifices, and I have to make mine.\n\nSacrifices for who? From what you have written it seems your dad have more or less thrown you under the bus for his own convenience. Certainly you have all had to make sacrifices, but did he ever communicate to you about them before the marriage? Once again, if he did not tell you about the changes beforehand, you have no reason to accept them. And if he expects sacrifices, he needs to make the same for **you**, not his new wife, not his new step-kids. You should be able to expect he will have your back, and *value* your sacrifices. If this is currently how much your sacrifices are worth to him, consider stopping the payments.\n\nYou should have the right of human decency, and privacy. You should not have to hide in your own home, you should not have to protect your belongings yourself, you have the right to defend yourself and your belongings when they are being damaged. Your wishes, requests and opinions have just as much right to exist as those of the rest of the family, **you** have just as much right to live and exist in your family as anyone else.  \n\nSo what to do? You need to communicate to your dad that if he wants all of you to be a family, you are important. You should be respected, accepted and valued, both in the family, and as an individual. You should not have to accept unfair treatment, **under any circumstance**. You should be included in decisions regarding your own life, you should be able to make demands, and for heavens sake, you should not have to have to protect yourself this way. Basic human decency, common courtesy, that is what you should demand. If they want you to be a team player, they need to invite you to the team briefings, if they want you to make sacrifices you should be able to make demands in return. This is a matter of communication, your dad should communicate with you, and have your best interest at heart, as well as the family. **You should be treated like a human, as your father's son and someone worthy of respect.**\n\nMy deepest condolences for your mother and situation, and my sincerest hopes for the improvement of said situation, from someone with the deepest sympathy for your situation. Rant over.",
            "When my parents had their heads so far up their asses with their own lives that they couldn't see how they were hurting us, I wrote letters. My parents were pretty A+ overall, and I haven't suffered the personal tragedy that you have so I can't completely relate, but I'll try my best. I'm a teacher and I specialize in Autism and behaviour. It has taught me a lot about how to deal with unhealthy human behaviour problems. I'll try to be brief with the behaviour stuff and then I'll draft a letter for you.\n\nIt sounds like your Dad and Stepmom are both overwhelmed and are giving the kids with the bigger behaviour problems more to keep them happy. Really it's just placating them. Your stepsiblings won't actually be happy because they get treated better, it will just bribe them to be on their best behaviour when the adults are around, and treat you worse when they are not. They are unknowingly setting up some really bad relationship dynamics by doing what they are doing.\n\nThey could also be so consumed and self involved with their new relationship that they have convinced themselves your relationships with each other will be rocky at first, but will work themselves out with time. This is also bad practice. You may learn how to live with each other like you are, (avoiding, being forced to stand up for yourself, hiding important personal items) but this is a bandaid type of solution and will likely lead to a lot of pent up frustration and long term personality conflicts.\n\nYour stepsiblings definitely feel as shitty about this situation as you do, and they, with a united front are placing the blame for their feelings squarely on your shoulders when it should be on their mother's. Try saying this to the boys. Something like, \"guys, this is a really shitty situation (\"tough\" if you don't want to swear). I'm sorry we're stuck together like this. Can you think of anything we can do together to make it better? \n\nBonding with the boys will subvert the destructive behaviour of your step sister. She may actually be struggling the most with this situation despite being given the most and being allowed to treat you terribly. If you can isolate her and get the boys on your side, the step mom will start to see some of daughter's problems as her own, not all of her kids \"justifiably\" not getting along with you. It will also show you're putting in some effort. AND they will likely stop doing shitty things to you like breaking your watch. They are young and are acting out because this move has been traumatizing. This is not an excuse for their poor behaviour. They owe you more than a proper apology. It won't come until they understand that it was wrong to hurt you, and that won't come until they care about you. Young kids are pretty moldable. \n\nIf your step sister notices you all getting closer, her behavior might escalate. Be aware of this and hide any important personal items that you have left, or stash them at a friend's house in a box.\n\nAs for your dad and step mother, you should be talking to them both together. They should be seeking counseling on how to make this transition smooth for everyone. Just going to your Dad keeps the family \"sides\" in place and won't be effective. Your Dad has already shown that he's not going to bat for you against step mom, so you need to change the dynamic to boundaries that you need to make this massive change in your life manageable. This is where the letter comes in.\n\nDear Dad and Step Dragon (jk),\n\nThis move has been a massive change in all our lives. I hope that in time we all come together and that this family grows strong and has lots of celebrations and good times to look forward to.\n\nI know that this has been very hard on me. I know it must be hard on you both too. I don't think complaining to you about the things that aren't working does anything but add to both of your stress, so I thought I would write this and clearly and calmly outline what I need to adjust to all of this. \n\n1) My personal items need to be respected. If something gets broken I expect an apology and for it to be replaced. Something very sentimental of mine was broken that cannot be replaced. I need both of you to find a way to ensure other items like this will be safe in the future.\n\n2) I understand why I have to share space with the boys. Forcing the three of us to share that small space together for three years until I go to school is not a long term solution. I need you both to find another solution to the space issue (cough, cough, fix up the basement), and let me know the timeline for that change. If I know when I will have a reasonable amount of space again, I'll be able to manage things for now.\n\n3) I need you both to respect that I have suffered a traumatic loss in my life. And now I feel like I'm losing my Dad too. I'm not being dramatic, my whole world was destroyed when my mom died, and now I have to adjust to my Dad not being just my Dad anymore. I understand that work keeps you from my games, but I'm 15 and I still need to know you're proud of me. I might need therapy to cope with all of this.\n\n4) If you can't help resolve some of the personality conflicts between step sister and I, I think we should go to some family therapy sessions together. We may not have to be best friends a love each other, but we do need to live together, and everyone has a right to a calm, safe, living environment. \n\nI love you. I want this to work. Can we please sit and talk about this, just the three of us, together tomorrow. \n\nThanks,\n\nOP\n\nGood luck and update!!! My grandparents split up (my grandmother was an abusive parent) and my grandpa remarried my step grandmother. He had 5 kids and she had 4! They were mostly teenagers. The stories from that time are totally crazy! There are still personality conflicts to this day, but they tried their very best and did do therapy to help. In the end what happened is a pretty close-knit family with tons of cousins and lots of happy memories. There is light at the end of this tunnel! My uncle had to sell his drum kit and move out at 17 so they could buy a different house. There was no space for him. He still talks about it, but they all still love each other and have somehow worked it out. Some sacrifices are shitty, but okay. Being bullied by your step siblings, however, is not okay and needs to be dealt with. \n\n",

Getting married is his choice so he should have to accept whatever comes along with that for himself, but since you had no input he should be doing his best to make this experience good for you. Honestly, both your dad and your stepmom sound less than ideal if they can give Jenny both her own room and the higher allowance. (I understand she needs her privacy, but she could change in the bathroom. Also, how do they reason that a teen girl needs her own privacy, but 1 teen and 2 preteen boys will not need their own privacy? The only fair thing is a 2/2 split where nobody gets their own privacy.) I almost can't blame her for being such a tyrant because she clearly grew up learning it's OK to be entitled.\n\nRuining your mom's watch is absolutely the last straw. Even though they probably didn't know what they were doing I'm so angry on your behalf and sorry about that. And if you're going to have to share a room with two people, those people, whoever they are, better damn well learn to respect your privacy. For the short-term I'd recommend moving the remaining valuables to the basement, because somehow to young minds they become less \"interesting\" there.\n\nI would recommend telling your dad that blending a family is supposed to be about COMPROMISE, not sacrifice, and that not only are you getting a raw deal, it's very clearly affecting your mental and emotional health. Your dad needs to make quality time to spend with you, and listen to you, and have your back. Just because he may be more strapped for time now does not excuse him from being a dad to his son. His attempts to \"not rock the boat\" are just selfish and cowardly. I would also tell him that spending time outside the house is keeping you sane, and attempting to limit your time forming other meaningful relationships, and punishing you for not wanting to be around this mess, is _controlling_. \n\nTell him that he either gets to stand up and DO something about this shitty situation where your stepsiblings are yelling at you and insulting you and breaking your things, or, _you won't be around for that shitty situation_.

It sucks, it really does.\n\nI lucked out because I was able to move in with my mom and then grandma to avoid as much of this abuse as possible, but it doesn't seem like you have an outlet like that.\n\nSometimes writing our feelings works out better then saying them. Make a list of what all you've sacrificed. Make a list of all the things they have broken. Make a list of any time you are made to feel like you aren't part of the family. Make a letter about how all of this makes you feel and is influencing your decisions in the future (for example, when I talked to my dad I emphasized how I will never be a part of his life again unless changes were made).\n\nFor a successful mixed family to work, everything has to be shared. Everything has to be equal. It sounds like your father is just appeasing his new wife atm, which will do more harm then good. It's setting a horrible precedent and will not change unless change happens soon.\n\nI would say be as brutally honest as you can in this letter. Tell your father exactly how his actions and your stepmoms words and actions will affect you right now and in the future. Tell him if you fantasize about leaving and never coming back. Tell him how hurt you were that a momento of the mother you'll never see again was stolen and broken without any repercussions. \n\nAlso, make sure to tell him how much you were looking forward to this new family at first. Tell him how you envisioned a family where you were all working together and get along. How he had time for you, your step siblings, and stepmom. Tell him how you were excited to share a house. And then tell him in all of the ways that dream was shattered, using real evidence and facts.\n\nMaybe even show your father this thread. Let him see stories like mine where family situations like this have forever ruined any chance at a close and deep relationship between bio father and son (in my case daughter). Your father needs a wake up call, and soon. I forever wish that I could have the relationship with my father like I used to, but all of those years of abuse (which I consider stuff like you listed as abuse since it's mainly directed at you) and inequality has forever tarnished the relationship I could have had with my father and stepfamily. I resent my stepsisters now and will never be as close to them as I wish we could have been (and how close I pictured it when I found out about the new family). \n\nAnother suggestion would be family therapy for everyone... or at least for you and your dad. A family therapist would be able to help set up ways in which you all can work together to be a happy blended family. A good therapist would also make sure that your words and feelings are known and validated. I would say ask your father if you all can do this, to become a stronger family... also to help deal with the loss of your mother and how this new family fits into the picture.\n\nFinally, if you ever need to vent, feel free to pm me. I have gone through a lot with my family and can offer an ear to listen or give you tips and tricks on how to cope / deal with certain situations. In my case, things got real bad... my stepmom went from telling me I wasn't a part of the family, to hitting me one day and spinning it to seem like I attacked her first (which my dad and stepsisters believed). It was bad, but through certain methods and through some self discoveries I've been able to \"survive\" it all and come out a better person... you can too.",

I would avoid being home as much as possible, and if your dad drops that line again \"by you not being here your not accepting the family\" I would then say hell yeah I don't accept them, they sure as hell don't accept me. Try to get a job bussing tables, save that money and get the fuck out, your dad doesn't have his sights on your well being so you must take it into your own hands, unfortunately its at your young age",

When you are 18 - apply to several universities, go for scholarship and move out. \n\n3. Life is unfair. People who suppose to love and protect you will screw you over.

            "Have you told your father what Jenny said to you? She was way out of line and completely unjustified. You have the right to ask someone not to touch your stuff. It doesn't seem right for your Dad to ground you for trying to stay out of the house after she has said it's best that you don't talk to them. Your Dad is trying to make things as easy as possible for his new step children but he's letting himself neglect you and your needs. You will need to make some sacrifices to help this arrangement to continue and help make your Dad and the family he's married into happy, such as with some of your stuff being stored in the basement and the allowance, but in other cases you need to open the lines of communication with everyone so that there are clear boundaries. Some of your belongings you can probably let your little step brothers play with, but others like your watch should be out of bounds. Since those kids just don't respect your wishes see if maybe you can arrange a locked drawer or something? Ask your Dad and your new step mom if they can please fix your watch that they wrecked. You're owed at least that. Bring up the fact that you've not once had a chance to eat out at one of your favourite places while the other kids have. That isn't fair at all and your Dad and step Mom have no excuse for that. Personally I think it's wrong that Jenny has been given the larger room while the 3 of you are in a smaller room, and that your allowance is closer in size to the 10 and 11 year old than the 17 year old. You've made a lot of sacrifices but there should be some compromise here as you seem to be taking the brunt of it. The others probably have found it hard to move home but your arrangements are clearly a lot worse off than before. Maybe try to get a part time job that will keep you out of the house more and give you more independence and budget.",
            "I don't have much advice for you other than an idea to give you some more space.   When I was 14 I moved into one half of my basement to escape sharing a room with my two sisters.   I had a wall made out of bookcases, and slept on an old couch until I figured out how to take my bed apart and move it.  \n\nMy advice is make a plan for turning part of the basement into your room. Put as much detail into it as possible.  Think of what you would have to do, like moving boxes around or getting an area rug for the part of the basement you want to make yours.  Make sure you stress that you will do all the work and it will cost your family no time or effort on their part.  \n\nEven if your dad doesn't go for the basement idea, the fact that you put so much thought and time into creating a plan to get your own space  might wake your dad up to the reality that his child is unhappy.  I wish you luck and recommend books as an at home escape.  Rarely do siblings or parents think to mess with something as innocent as a book.  ",
            "Holy shit, OP. As a parent and stepparent, this makes my blood boil.\n\nWe have my stepsons on weekends. They get their own room--the slight bigger one--because their younger brother goes to bed 2-3 hours before them. That is the ONLY reason they're separated like this. If we have another kid, the younger two will share a room, or the older two will get the downstairs basement (which is as big as the master bedroom with its own bathroom) and the other two will have their own rooms.\n\nThe way your dad has done this is horseshit. Why can't he clear out the basement and give that to you? You're 15 years old, only 2 years younger than your older stepsister--why don't YOU get personal space? You have to share a room with two SIGNIFICANTLY younger stepsiblings?\n\nIf your dad refuses the basement option, quite frankly, I'd look into either moving in with another family member who gives a crap about your personal space/items (seriously, your dad doesn't punish the stepkids for ruining your things? BULL. SHIT.), or start thinking ahead. It sounds like you'll have to grow up a lot faster than you expected, but it'll give you a plan.\n\nConsider what jobs you can get once you're of age. Once you hit that age, start applying. If it means you take the bus, so be it. At that age, see if any of your friends want to rent out an apartment together--at least then you'll have say in what's going on.\n\nAs for your dad's punishments--well, I can't say this is the BEST way to go about it, but when I was kept home or grounded or banned form TV or whatever, I read. A lot. Keep your nose in a book that interests you. It's a lot harder for a parent to justify banning you from books, and once you find the kind that interest you, it'll give you a place to escape while you read. That should at least give you a coping mechanism for when you're stuck in a place you hate to be.\n\nIf possible, I'd also speak to a school counselor and ask if they have any other coping mechanisms they can recommend.\n\nI'm truly sorry. Your father and stepmother are embarrassments on blended families. You don't make one kid sacrifice; EVERYONE has to be a team player. Putting all the onus on you is shitty parenting. He's turning you into the scapegoat. I imagine your mother would be ashamed of how he's behaving.",
            "How did your dad react to the watch thing. Everyone else is sort of glossing over it. But you need to raise hell about that. They broke a momento of your mother who died from cancer. That is messed up. And tell them to keep their hands off your stuff tell Jenny to shut up get out of your face because you didn't invite her into the conversation and you are done being nice. \nActually ignore all of that advice. I forget sometimes people are not as abrasive as me. I will try to be more peaceful. Tell your dad that you feel like he is choosing this woman and her family over you and you feel betrayed. They broke something given to you by your mom. His first wife. Does he have any emotions left? Why is he not fixing that watch or taking away their allowance to fix it? Also, tell Jenny that from now on she is not to speak to you unless you directly say so. Next time tell those kids to keep their hands off your stuff from now on. And if she buts in put your hand in her face and tell her \"Hush I'm not talking to you right now\" and turn your back to her\" Say she has been acting like a prissy queen for too long and you are knocking her off her throne. So she can screw off. Actually that sounded abrasive to. Well you get the idea. Just do it nicer somehow.",

            "I'm sorry you ended up in such a shitty situation, I really feel for you. \n\nStand your ground with your step-siblings; do not be mean or unkind (that's ammunition for them to use against you), but be firm and make it known you're not cool with their violation of your boundaries. I know it's exhausting but the more you do it the easier it gets, trust me. If you don't show any signs of weakness and are consistent in your attitude towards them, they might just back off. Hell, maybe even respect you. They're probably just as pissed off as you are. \n\nAs for your Dad, he's got blinkers on and is clearly pandering to his new wife & insta-family unit, and until the shine wears off (or you move out), he's not likely to see the light I'm afraid. Again, keep on letting it be known - firmly and fairly - that you are unhappy with the situation. I know what it's like to have a parent who doesn't listen to straightforward communication. \n\nCan you get a part-time job to supplement your allowance? This might help you save up a bit more until you can move out. Also, it'd keep you out of the house more. ",

            "I really feel for you, OP. \n\nMaybe your dad (foolishly) is thinking of you as an extension of himself - HE'S had to sacrifice a lot to build a new life with this new woman, when the biggest part of that old life was you. The part that takes it over the edge is that he's putting that burden on *you,* when you never asked for any of this. \n\nI wonder what kind of dynamic OP's dad and new wife have for him to think that he needs to cater to her (and by that same extension as before, her kids) to be approved of. \n\nIf he really does think in those terms, maybe remind him that he should really be working for family unity where everyone cares about each other, instead of thinking in terms of sacrifice. The first framework results in a need for you to be treated equally, where the second has got you to where you are now. ",

Maybe a counselor in school could help. If money isn't tight, you can ask him to see a therapist (you can say you're still grieving your mom and needs outsite help in dealing with these feelings - which is probably true anyway). Then you can ask your therapist to mediate.",

I know that doesnt seem \"fair\" or \"right\", but youre playing a game of politics now; justice is broken in your household. Right now, you've got nobody in your corner. I know what that feels like. It's important to not lose your cool.

Before your dad got married?\n\n- Your dad works overtime, did he do that before, or are there significant new expenses? Does your step mom work?\n\nLet me make a book recommendation to you: \"How To Win Friends And Influence People\" by Dale Carnegie. It is your new bible. Read it, know it, practice it. Your job now is manipulation. I know that sounds wrong, but where others in your house have failed to build a working system, it is your opportunity now to succeed. Let me be clear: I am not advocating for you to lie, cheat, or prey on others here. That is a counter-productive strategy. There are a lot of positive methodologies in this book that can help you without hurting others.\n\nIf you need a copy, I suggest you procure a digital one so that it cannot be destroyed and will be forever present in the cloud. If you have no money, PM me and I'll be happy to send you a credit on the platform of your choice.\n\nThe point in doing this is that once they like you, you can begin to leverage it. Slowly at first, then more later. I know that sounds really shitty, and I promise I did not twirl my mustache just now, but you're in a shitty situation already. What you have now does not work for anybody in your new family, especially you and your dad. You have the power to change that. You just need to learn how.",
            "I don't know your dad, but this reminds me of mine. (Rant coming...)\nMine told me, \"you always have a home here..etc\" but married his wife 4 years ago and brought her & her teenage daughter over and everything changed. \nWife went through my stuff I had packed there, burned my mother's fancy candles, used my picture frames to put pics of herself in (posted a pic of herself in every room of the house as well.. Even the basement bathroom. Literally. Every room), used my personal stuff for her personal use, threw out my mother's books and decorated the house with my fancier items. I. Was. Livid.\nThat broke my relationship with my dad (not that it was particularly great to begin with) because he didn't hold her accountable. To this day I still avoid her like the plague. He tried lecturing recently on how I'm never around and \"that makes her feel bad, like you don't care.\" The moment I raised my point, he dismissed me entirely, \"Carry on. You never let go of anything.\" Fuck you.\nThat's my rant. I'm much happier having left that far behind as a memory and I've since made my own home. An important lesson here is you know how much this hurts, remember this for future.\n\nEdited: 'her' to herself.\nEdit 2: I'm not much help in my response here as reading this post made me angry. I sympathize with OP; though I hope the future of the bioparent-child relationship is not destroyed as a result of the marriage and move-in like mine was, if there is no room for compromise for OP, unfortunately, it may require patiently waiting and saving before being able to fly from the nest and build your own.

            "OP, I think you should sit your dad and step mom down and show them this thread. It's not at all unreasonable for them to expect you to make sacrifices and share, but they need to be more equitable in their treatment of the four of you. It sounds to me like Jenny feels just as uprooted by the transition. It doesn't excuse her treatment of you, but your parents should be stepping up and helping her find a healthier way to deal with it instead of allowing her to take it out on you or allowing her to try and drive a wedge between you and your new brothers. One thing that stood out to me- you say your dad is working a lot of overtime. If he's doing that, its likely because he has to- he has three additional mouths to feed now. Talk to him, but also be patient with him. It sounds to me like he's not insensitive so much as stressed out and impatient- he has much less time and energy but is now, for the first time in his life as a parent, having to play mediator between siblings. Granted, that's not an excuse. He made the choice to marry your stepmother and commit to being a father to all of you, so he needs to be willing to fully address these situations rather than being dismissive of your feelings. Your parents aren't doing any of you any favors by allowing the situation run unchecked- their silence is an unintentional endorsement.",

That is, how to make yourself financially stable enough so that when you are legally old enough to be able to remove yourself from this situation, you can. \n\nI moved out when I was 17, and some places you can move out when you are 16, even without legal emancipation.

In your interactions with them, keep that in mind.  You haven't done anything to deserve crappy treatment, but you're all kids and you might be taking this shit out on each other because of the shitty situation.\n\nWhen the younger kids fuck with your shit, deal with your father.  If you haven't already, let him know ASAP about that watch and what it meant to you.  I can't imagine that he'll let that slide without at least speaking to your stepmom.

            "Good advice here from everybody but I wanted to add: Nothing scares parents more than to have screwed up so bad their kids want nothing to do with them as adults.  Talk to your dad and tell him you only have three more years with him and once you're 18, you are out and you won't forget how unfairly he's treating you now. If he wants to have an adult relationship with you at all,  he needs to start showing he cares about you more than his new wife.  ",
            "It sounds like your father is working really hard to look good to his new wife. Is his new wife doing anything to get to know you and look good for your dad?\n\nHonestly your story makes me cry.\n\nWhat I see is that your mom and dad made this beautiful life together. Got married... bought a house... made a baby... filled the family with love..\n\nThings went horribly wrong...\n\nYour dad, as he should have, has moved on.. however instead of bringing you with him and building a new family for the two of you, you seem to be in the way of his new life.\n\nI really hope that his new wife is not the problem here.. because if she was/is not totally into you being in her life then your dad should have moved on... It may be that his heart was so broken and he latched onto this woman he would have been totally perfect if he had been childless.. but he isn't.\n\nUnfortunately sometimes parents put their happiness first in these types of instances and completely overlook the promises that they made when they brought children into the world...\n\n\nSooo.. what I would ask your dad is:\n\n\"Is me being in your life a sacrifice that you have to make now that Mom is gone?\" \n\n\nIt is important that he know that you realized that after mom died, it wasn't going to be you and him making your way through the world as a duo forever... That you wanted him to find love again and be happy but that you never expected that him being happy meant that you were in the way.\n\nTell him that you feel like more of a possession than a living breathing part of his life. When things were awesome, you were important... but now that he has a new life, it seems that there isn't enough room in the house for you anymore and instead of people all finding a place to fit in, you are being pushed out.\n\n\nI also agree with others about the room. The 2 brothers should have moved in with you, not you completely be put in a corner of the office... If your dad and his new wife cannot afford a larger home they need to do better than this.\n\nThe allowance is also ridiculous. Their mom should continue with their allowances and your dad should continue with yours.\n\nHow is it that your dad does not see that him getting married took away everything for you? Including, it seems, his love.\n\n\nEDIT: I just want to add... When parents believe in their children, listen to them and love them they create a world where the child can make their own way.. where dreams come true and where the results of hard work can be envisioned... \nWhen parents brush children off... try to make the child say and do and be what the parents needs at the moment so the child isn't a burden... when the child has to fit into the parents life... an environment is created where the child is always working for attention and love and his/her own hopes and dreams become things that are unimportant and unobtainable...\nIf your dad is reading this.. please do not break your child... Children are not throwaways... and once you break them they don't go back the way they once were. Don't you love your child anymore? What you are doing is exactly what happens when a puppy grows up and isn't fun and cute anymore for those who bought a puppy for entertainment, so he gets chained up and forgotten. Your child is not a toy, he is a living, breathing growing person who will be his own adult very shortly... Don't you dare give away all his opportunities to your new wives daughter.\n\nI am so angry at your father right now... So angry!",

She may actually be a decent person and willing to discipline them even if your Dad isn't.  \n \nAllowance is the one thing that is really ridiculous, but you're old enough to get a job.

Just say \"I want everyone to get along but Jenny treats me like crap and the smaller ones don't respect boundaries. If she is a reasonable person then you can come to a level of respect and reach an agreement. If she isn't a reasonable woman then it makes option two the go-to. I would normally not suggest this of a child because I'm big on respecting parents and elders in general. But it sounds like your dad is a bit of an ass. And this step mother could of could not be a much better person. Just kidding from the post I'm going with the latter since it appears she hasn't raised respectful children. Anyways on to option 2. If your going to be grounded and punished anyways... Then do whatever you want. Not be a horrible kid. Still do your school work and be a decent human. But if people aren't giving you any respect then there isn't much reason for you to show respect either. You have to give respect to earn it. And that even goes for parents. If he forces you to be around people who treat you like shit then show him he can't force you to be around it. Make your own curfew. This goes back to bring decent human. Not just \"I'll show him and stay out til 3 am \"... But \" I'm gonna get out of the house until bedtime \". He will ground you and take away your allowance. And probably try to find other punishments. And it may take 2 times... It may take 15... It may never change. But you can tell him that your tried communicating with him and he was busy choosing to try to make his new family happy at the expense of your happiness and disregarding and not caring about the resentment he is causing. In true relationship fashion in sure 75% of people are going to suggest talking to a therapist. But that doesn't sound exactly like it's likely to happen. So communicate with step mom. Then you can try talking to dad one more time. Then it's time to just do what it takes to preserve your well being. Whatever that may be.",

We are in different states with different lives. In your case, focus on making yourself better than them. Regardless of what sister says, the younger boys may look up to you as a role model.

            "You should suggest therapy/counselling, maybe just for the two of you to start. You can lie to get it: I know I've been acting out, so can we get some help for me to adjust to these changes? Then explain to the counsellor how you feel. Try to focus on the more important things first: they stole and broke your dead mom's watch and got no consequences, your step-sister verbally abuses you and gets no consequences, they make it so you hate being in your own home and are afraid there and get no consequences, and if you try to stay away, so that you could feel safe from harassment, then you get the consequences. I know that all of these things are important to you, and I totally get what you are saying, but if you start the discussion with things like having to share a room or not getting your favourite foods, adults will think you're just complaining about being in a blended family. The situation isn't that you need to share a room or that your allowance was reduced, it's that your father has decided that, of the 6 people living in your house, one (you) needs to be a \"team member\" and the rest can do whatever they like with no consequences. You are used to being your dad's first priority. It was obvious that his priorities would shift after his marriage. But now you're not even on his list of priorities at all. His priorities are: making his wife happy, making his step kids happy, making himself happy, making sure you're sufficiently punished for wanting to live safely  in your own house. I hope your dad snaps out of it soon. If he doesn't, I know that 3 years feels long, but it will end eventually. Then you can get out and never look back. \n\nOne supplementary suggestion is to have lots of excuses for being out of the house: join all possible teams and after-school activities. Spend a lot of time in the library doing homework. Maybe even get a part-time job. \n\nAnother suggestion, only if nothing else works, is being honest, with your dad and with every other person in your life, every single time. I think you probably care about your father and try to please him or not make him look bad in front of others. Don't. \"How is it living with new step siblings?\" \"It's really shitty, mainly because they call me names and steal my stuff, and then I get punished for it.\" \"Why are you joining all these clubs?\" \"Because otherwise I would need to stay home, where I get called names and my things get stolen and broken.\" I'm a firm believer in not making things easy for people who don't deserve it. Right now, it's way easier for him to punish you for existing than it is for him to talk with his wife or control his step kids. Make it hard for him to keep doing what he is doing, by clearly stating, to him and everyone else, what's going on. Don't let him lie to himself by pretending this is just about you being spoiled by your allowance or something. This is about you feeling unhappy and unsafe in your own home. This will definitely cause more conflict, so don't do it unless you've tried other ways of communicating with him.",

At least that way you could have your own space, and most definitely get a lock box for your valuables! You need to sit down with your dad and stepmom and have a conversation about the things going on and they should also understand that your life's been turn upside down. I mean you went from just the two of you, to adding four people to your family unit. I can tell you from past experience, (I had a horrible stepmom growing up, she's much better now that we are all adults) bide your time. Three years is a long time, get good grades and stay out of trouble and then get the hell out of there! I hope it gets better for you! But your stepmom sounds like a POS, and her kids can do no wrong in her eyes. I'm sorry you're dealing with this, OP. ",
            "Can you go to ACADEMY SPORTS and get a safe to lock-up your valuables?... Esp your mom's watch. (You can replace the watch-face, at least.) I'm sorry. Get a job. Get a bank account and save. Get ready to move out once you start college. ",
            "I notice a lot of talk about sacrifices you need to make for them.  But if your dad is working a lot more than he used to, and yet there's less money available, that tells me that your new stepmom and her kids are getting substantial resources from your Dad.  So are they sacrificing for the team as well?  Or this all \"You and your Dad sacrifice, they reap the benefits?\"  \n\nMaybe your Dad has fallen in love with a woman who has less money than he does, and so now the new family unit has a lower lifestyle than you used to enjoy.  So don't think of it as sacrificing to make your stepmom and her kids happy.  Think of it as sacrificing for your Dad's sake.  Even if his new wife truly loves him and isn't just a gold-digger, the happiness level of her kids can affect the stresses on a relationship.  So his desire to give them the best life possible is understandable.  \n\nBut your Dad needs to recognize that you're sacrificing for HIS sake, and not make that harder than it has to be by grounding you because you're trying to make the best of a bad situation. He needs to meet you halfway.",
            "I would suggest writing a script for yourself to follow, or a letter, where you outline all the issues and some potential choices.\n\nLike the game system. Look up how much it would cost to replace. Explain that the game system got broken and that you would like it replaced. Explain your ideas for how that could be done: 1) parents replace. 2) children that broke it contribute to cost. 3) all of you contribute to cost (and include how many allowance weeks that would be) as that is the most equitable way to do it and you are getting a new system, not an old one, so you contributing also gets you something better.\n\nThe watch can also be fixed. I would suggest listing options for that too.\n\nI am guessing your dad and step mom are in way, way, over their heads. Laying it out with options may get you what you want quicker, even if it means more compromise.\n\nAlso, in my experience, the adults are expecting you to be \"the least work.\" Which is unfair. Often adults think teen girls are a challenge, or small children are a challenge. I may be projecting but it seems like your dad is expecting you to \"man up,\" but that isn't appropriate. Firstly, that is going to make you resent your new siblings. Secondly, that's a 20 year ago attitude, AND you're still a kid. I hope it is not the case here that this is their expectation.\n\nI don't know if there is any possibility in talking to the oldest and coming to a truce of sorts. She may be convinced to see your way of thinking on some things. You might be able to talk to her about how you are both older and could look out for each other with the parents. There will inevitably be times in the future where she wants  to go out but someone has to stay home with the younger kids. Or where you may get a job and a car and she has none and may need her. Ask her to think ahead and think about if there is ever a time when she may need you and to realise that she is either building or breaking a relationship now. ",
            "I would have sent somebody to the hospital after that watch bit....no way...\n\nYou need to stand up for yourself in some way, that at least is for sure, not sure what the best way would be but they at least have to understand that what they're doing is wrong.",
            "Hey OP, I'm sorry your situation has changed for the worst. It really sucks, especially at the age that you are and the age of your new step-siblings.....I wonder if your dad is often overworking because he's trying his best to make the situation for the whole family better? Maybe he wants to get a nicer, bigger house so you can have your own room again, so all your allowances can be more equal, etc?\n\nSounds like your dad hasn't given much thought to your concerns, and he may be brushing it off because a lot of adults think teens can get dramatic about small things. But why don't you show him this post, and ask him to really give thought to how miserable you are? You have a lot of internet strangers here who are listening to you and giving you support, please don't get too frustrated and run away! Breathe, go hang out with friends, and try approaching your dad in a calm but serious manner, or just send him this post. Good luck, I hope your situation improves!",
            "You know what you can do? Be the best you can be at school (Freshman in high school?). Get laser focused on school life, events, etc. Parents can't say much when you're excelling at school and that's what you're out for. This way you can go anywhere you want when you graduate due to having your pick of schools for university. You'll likely also be able to obtain scholarships. Don't focus on anything else but that one singular goal Take every day, one day at a time and control what you can control to make a better life for yourself. \n\nHere's the reasoning: Your step-siblings are most likely just as upset as you are. Getting a rise out of you and a reaction allows them to feel comfort in knowing that you're as uncomfortable as they are. Non-reactions or not being focused on them will cause them to get bored or turn their attention to other things. And being the new dad, your dad wants to make your step mom's life as easy as possible and that means making her kids' life as easy as possible. Unfortunately, this means sacrificing your comfort. There are two reactions you can have to this: 1. Complain your heart out and maybe get what you want, possibly making life more difficult for your dad and the step family as well as burning up any goodwill you may have built up and may be able to build up in the future. 2. Do what you can to make life easy for everyone else in the short term and build up good will, while also giving yourself the flexibility to do what you want when you're of age.\n\nEconomically and in game theory, giving yourself options is the best thing because it allows you to dictate terms of engagement in the end. You'll also grow as a person and be able to overcome struggles that come later in life. Xbox is broken? Go study instead. Don't spend your allowance money; save it and invest into your tomorrow. Most likely, your step sister isn't saving her $100/week, neither are your brothers. Leverage in life is the most important commodity. But don't just burn your leverage for what you want immediately; think about the future. \n\n\nTL;DR: Focus on the things you can control, like schoolwork and money management. Take the sacrifices, store as leverage. Your dad and stepmom, if they don't notice now, will at some point notice and realize they've been shunning your needs. If you want to be a real clear about your sacrifices, write down every time a sacrifice has been made. But more for yourself; look at it and say, what's one more thing? ",
            "Have you sat him down and told him all this? ",
            "Your stepmom must be hot as fuck. \n\nThis is some bullshit. Your dad isn't standing up for you or even himself. I think he may have to get his man-card taken away.",
            "If you can you should just move out. ",
            "Yeah dude your new family sucks. One thing you should do for now is buy some kind of safe box to put your special belongings there that way you will be able to protect the things that are meaningful to you. Try to spend the most time out of your house. I know it kinda sucks but as of now your father is not thinking logically and therefore you should try to spend the least time with them in the house. Focus on increasing your grades so that you can get a scholarship to a good university and then forget about living with those people.\n\nYou need to survive.",
            "A lot of the things here seem like a good idea. Maybe you haven't talked to him in private, in your post you said that you have talked to him but was it away from the rest of the family? \n\nAnother thing that I saw is that your father is probably also making sacrifices (working overtime to fund these bogus allowences), but it seems like it he doesn't keep you in mind in them. You could phrase it like \"Dad I know how we've all been through a hard time and in these past few months adjustment has been the new policy. And due to these adjustments we've all had to make sacrifices in different ways, but due to how you've reacted to me and how I feel about the situation I don't feel like I've been in your mind these last months. I just wish that we could change a few things and re-establish some boundries.\" I assume your a only son so if that's the case I would add this. \"Also adjusting to having siblings has been hard and how they've been treating me has been less than optimal. I'd like for them to respect me and my personal space.\" \n\n\"It's all been a lot to process and I just don't want to feel like I'm carrying the short end of everyone's stick. Once again, I know it hasn't been an easy process for anyone in the house, but I'd rather this be a negotiation rather than just a order.\" \n\nIf you go with the letter or talk route, try and make sure he's alone when he reads/hears this. I'm sure it's just as much a process for you as it is for him, and he probably took these decitions thinking that they were fair looking to him and that you could take whatever came in your way.\n\nHopefully you can work this out.",

            "Is you father wealthy? Because to me they found their way to manipulate him, sacrificing you in the process.",
            "Honestly, I'd consider showing this to your dad, and all our responses. Maybe it will wake him up. Sometimes you need an outside perspective to see what you're doing is wrong.",
            "Your relationship with your step-siblings sounds really unfortunate. How is your relationship with your step-mom? Can you go talk to her about how you feel?

            "I'm late to the party and you've already received a lot of good advice, but I wanted to share with you that I experienced nearly the same thing when I was growing up, so you know you're not alone.\n\nMy dad remarried when I was about 11, to a woman with two kids around the same age as my little brother (4) and I. Thankfully, our mom had custody of us, so we only had to share living space during our part-time, every other weekend visits. Unfortunately, our dad's favoritism of our step-siblings was present full-time. If my brother and step-brother had sports games at the same time, my dad ALWAYS chose the step-brother. If one of us fought with one of them, he ALWAYS chose their side, even if we were right. There was a period during my teenage years where I tried living with my dad because of difficulties with my mom, and I literally went back to living with my physically and mentally abusive mother because of how I was treated at my dad's. And keep in mind, the step-kids' dad was still in the picture and had joint custody. But still, my dad was being more of a dad to them than to my brother and me. And he was letting his new wife make all the parenting decisions, even though she wouldn't let him have a say in how she parented her kids.\n\nFor my dad, he was blinded by \"love\" (aka having regular sex after years of being alone). He and the second wife were married less than a year after meeting online. They stayed married for nearly ten years, until he finally got fed-up with her laissez-faire attitude of parenting, letting her kids get away with anything, to the point where her teenaged son pulled a knife on my dad after being told not to scream at his mother. Then they separated and finally divorced.\n\nIs it similar for your dad? Is the relationship still young enough that maybe he's just blinded by the novelty of it and letting your step-mom run the show? It could be that once the \"honeymoon\" period is over, he might pull his head out of his ass.\n\nI think following some of the advice here (like showing him this thread) could be helpful, depending on how your dad handles being told he's wrong. My dad never handles that kind of thing well, so it wouldn't have helped me. Otherwise, as someone who has been here, it hurts for me to tell you that things may never really change. With my dad, when I tried to explain my feelings, I was told I was being too sensitive and anti-social with my \"siblings,\" and that I needed to get my act together and be a full member of the \"family\" or get used to being excluded. I'm hoping you are more successful. If you need to talk to someone who's been through this, please feel free to PM me anytime.",
            "Find reasons to get out of the house that they can't argue with: camp, volunteer work, extra-curricular activity. When you are old enough -- if you can -- get a job.  That will both put some distance between you and them and give you a foundation to get out as soon as possible.\n\nYour step-mom sees you as a competitor for your father's attention, money and affection -- and that's a fight you can't win as long as your dad has the hots for her.\n\nAnd since all of those are good resume builders you can just say you are trying to be a successful adult -- it has nothing to do with them -- why would it?  That will be hard to argue with.",

            "Don't stop voicing your grievances to your father. When he comes back \"you have to make sacrifices,\" you tell him it's unfair that you're making too many sacrifices without you ever getting to voice your opinion about what was going to happen. Do you not feel like you got replaced with the stepsister? I think I would.\n\nExplain to him you feel like you're being treated like a 12 year old triplet to your two stepbrothers, and that it isn't fair for you three boys to share a smaller space or that the stepsister gets more than twice what you're personally getting now. That maybe it should be split $60/$50, but not $75/$35.\n\nFinally and most importantly, remind him that YES, this situation isn't going to last forever. BUT that someday you will be living on your own and will be able to choose what kind of relationship you and he will have when you're an adult. That if you go through the next three years feeling like you never mattered that much compared to his 'new family', that if they were treated as always more important to him than you were, then your father-son relationship is not going to be what he hopes it will be when you get older and have your own spouse and children.\n\nYou have little or no power right now. It sucks, but that's just the way it is. But when you get older and can get out on your own, then you will have all the power to decide what kind of relationship you'll have with your family and stepfamily. Because if everything goes like this till you move out, you won't want a relationship with them later in life. Not any of them.\n\n",
