I took the advice and broke up and realised that the relationship was really sucking the life out of me and was the worst thing in my life at the moment. Since then I have met someone who understands me and cares for me, theres no drama (Well I once ate the last pizza slice and she got pretty angry but yeah thats the level of the drama). We support each other and she makes me a better human all around.\n\nBecause of my ex i wasn't able to focus on my studies and the breakup combined with the Covid Pandemic gave me ample time for studying and I landed an internship at a big Bulge Bracket company and also Im working on a few personal projects that I love spending time on. The pandemic also gave me time to realise that I was with the wrong person and I love many others who love me be it my family, friends,etc. I feel really liberated.\n\nToday I was looking back at what used to be and I remembered that this subreddit for the trigger point for the change in my life. SO THANK YOU AND YOU ALL ARE AWESOME. Its because of you Ive gone from Crying nights to Happy days.\n\nEdit 1: Some edits based on comments.\n\nEdit 2: HOLY SMOKES! I didnt expect such a reaction. Thanks Guys.\n\nEdit 3: Such Wholesome Comments, Thanks Guys.\n\nTL;DR! - Took the advice of fellow redditors and broke up with my ex and spent probably the best year of my life.",

            "Happy for you. I\u2019m in a similar situation. But I don\u2019t know if any cheating as gone on. \n\nMy girlfriend, her \u201cbestfriend\u201d hates me because I stole her from him (her words). Their entire relationship is shady. When I used to question it, she\u2019d either get defensive and make fun of my ex and my history, or she stonewalls - goes silent and complacent. Nothing ever changes. I\u2019ve given her the ultimatum many times but she says it\u2019s fucked up thay I did, idk. Maybe she\u2019s right. Now it\u2019s gotten to the point where I feel so invalidated by the lack of accountability she shows for treating me like shit and sometimes second to him. It\u2019s obvious he wants to be her boyfriend \u2014 hates hearing about me, has insulted me, calls her constantly to make sure she\u2019s safe and not upset with Him, she lies about hanging out with Him, we\u2019re not allowed to meet??  I have no proof of cheating physically but emotionally no doubt. I feel like I\u2019m upset for no reason though. The way she makes it seem like no problem or brushes it off makes me feel unjust in being upset. I tell her that if the situation were reversed she\u2019d be furious. All she says is \u201cI understand\u201d and nothing ever changes. \n\n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point where I get fed up and explode with emotion regarding this. We\u2019ve both called each other abusive in respect to the situation. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t want to leave her. I love her so much. but I really don\u2019t want to feel like absolute shit. \n\nI related to so many points, your ex held up many double standards that my current girlfriend does. I\u2019m not allowed to talk shit about their relationship??? But she can constantly shame me for sleeping with girls that she finds ugly. \n\n\nAnyways. I\u2019m at a loss. I\u2019m happy for you, somewhat jealous too. I wish you the best with your new friend!",

I confessed my love for her one night, she told me she didn't reciprocate. Thankfully, it did not make things awkward and we maintained a great friendship. I was 7 months into a new relationship, and she confessed her love for me. I couldn't bail on my relationship, so I rejected her. \n\nI ended up marrying that relationship, having kids.

We are in an intense academic program together and he said he wasn\u2019t considering dating until the program is finished.  I have taken that as him letting me down gently but my feelings are still there.  I care for him as a human, not only for his D, so I shrugged it off and we\u2019ve maintained our friendship \u2014 the more we talk, the more I feel our friendship is growing.

            "I met my boo on a dancefloor; neither of us can remember when. Many many dancefloors and afterparties later we eventually became very good friends. I was so flattered when he came to afterparty at my house one time --he knew all sorts people with better speakers, nicer houses. After many hours of cameraderie, everyone else departed on a mission to Taco Bell. He stayed alone with me in my living room and we talked and talked and played music till the next evening. Taco Bell is one of his favorite things so I knew later that he already loved me then. I had my hand on his leg and still it just felt like a natural platonic friendship. We soon were texting and messaging all the time about insignificant things, always feeling the same way about them. A while later I woke up and wanted to make out with him really bad. We were both shy so it still took a few weeks after that to make it happen. And now here we are, 0 kids and hundreds of dancefloors later. Being friends first is the best",
            "Congratulations. This gives me a lot of hope. I am in love with my best friend.  I told him a little over a year ago but at that time he said he wasn't interested in long distance and I can't really blame him.  We stayed good friends but drifted a bit apart.  A few months ago some things came to a head and it reignited our friendship and brought us really close. We have now spent some time together in person and got on quite well. No idea where this road is leading, but I'm glad to see that sometimes it leads to love.",

            "This is one of the most feel good stories I have seen on Reddit in a while.  \nWill say this much because it resonates with me. I have somebody who I have known for many years now. There's always been that \"There's something between us\" vibe going. I chose somebody else who lived closer when I was last single, she got with someone else a year later who was also closer to her... My relationship went on for almost 3-years and hers lasted for around 2-years. Wouldn't you know that we've both sort of come back to each other as if time hadn't really passed. Granted I am healed from my break up and she's still working through hers, but we definitely have chemistry. \n\nShe's ALWAYS liked me and I have always been drawn to her. I know many-many years ago the guy she was with at the time must have caught wind of that chemistry or was controlling because out of nowhere she blocked me for about a year. Was bummed about it but one day she popped back up and we were right back to where things were before. There always has been that undertone where both of us are attracted to each other.\n\nHonestly I see where her and I make a good coupling because we both went through particularly rough break-ups, so we both know what happened to each other and we both are really supportive of each other. But as the old saying goes we'll see...\n\nIn any event I am very happy you have your best friend and make each other happy",

            "How did you go from being friends to holding hands or kissing?",
            "There are so many stories like this -- it does make me think that it's reasonable to be suspicious when the person you're dating has a close friend of the gender they're attracted to who seems to have feelings for them. Because in this case, it would have been justified for the person you were dating while you were still in love with your friend to be jealous of her.",

She ghosted me for years after that cz she started seeing this guy, who turned out to be an asshole.\n\nBack in November she reached back out to me and we been talking every since. Yesterday, she calls me and we were on the phone for four hours. At the end of the convo she decides to bring up the past and how our friendship ended. I asked her why she brings it up and she says \"well I love what we have and I really missed it. I'm sorry I cut you off and won't happen again. I'm just scared of losing you again\". After talking to her a little bit more I asked her what she wanted out of all this then, and she says she's just scared to hurt me and doesn't know how to feel. I asked her if she just wants to keep it platonic, and after a few \"I don't know\", she says yes. Now I'm stuck here wondering if I've been friendzone, or she's just scared things happen and we lose the firendship we have, again. I'm more distraught about this little thing than my last break up of my now ex-Fianci we I was with for 8 years. I don't get what girls want sometimes. I have 7 sisters and so many female friends, and sometimes I feel like no matter how much experience I have, Ill never understand women.\n\nI'm glad things worked out for you brother. It's great things fell into place. I hope it works out for me as well, cz I can't see myself with anyone but this girl. But life isn't fair sometimes so I guess I just gotta take the punches.",
            "That\u2019s awesome! I hope it works out for you guys! My story; We met last year and sat across from each other in class for little less than a year, my best friend said she liked him. She didn\u2019t really know him and I think it was a based on looks but towards the middle of the school year I was fighting off feelings for him. (My friend liked someone else) Anyway I didn\u2019t tell him and by the beginning of the next year I had liked him for quite a long time. I told myself liking him over the summer didn\u2019t count but idk rn. He met a girl and they started dating. Right as they were dating did I told him I had feelings for him. He was cool about it and told me he used to like me too. He actually got broken up with and is now single but I\u2019m not going to ask him out because he doesn\u2019t seem to like me anymore. (Btw I\u2019m young but I think I\u2019m in love :( so it sucks for me but I\u2019m very shy so I don\u2019t want to say anything)",

She never thought of me like that. But I told her to think about it, after a week she said she wanted to remain friends. I told her that I didn\u2019t want that, and that if nothing more is going to happen between us, then we shouldn\u2019t hang out anymore. We still hung up after that, but not as friends.

Two weeks after I posted the above, we got into a fight because I was surprised to see him in the kitchen when I had just saw him in the bedroom. I said, \"Oh you're up!\" He responded by rolling his eyes, shrugging his shoulders and demanding, \"Is that a problem?!\"\n\nI said \"Of course not, I was just surprised!\" and went on to do the laundry. He left the kitchen and went into the bedroom. He gave me one-word answers when I tried talking to him. I guessed he needed time to himself so I went into the living room to call my friend. As I was talking to her I heard him leave the apartment. \n\nAfter I finished talking to her about 20 minutes later, I went out to find him playing Pokemon Go. I tried talking to him like normal and he kept giving me one-word answers, not looking at me. I finally asked him what was wrong. He said nothing. I said to tell me. He said he didn't feel welcome in my apartment because of my \"tone.\"\n\nFor listeners who heard the previous fights, you'll know my \"tone\" and the \"wordings\" of my sentences were things that triggered him a lot. Even if they were innocent statements like, \"I thought you were traveling on Monday?\" or anything else that somehow threatened him and made him immediately defensive.\n\nUnlike other times, where we would launch into a fight that would last hours or DAYS because he would insist I would have a tone, I would say I didn't mean it that way, and apologize, and it wasn't enough, this time we managed to pass through it fairly unscathed (and due mostly to my patience, if I may say).\n\nBut then later that day he told me how annoying my indecision was. That I could never relax. \n\nThat night I wanted to see some friends for a few hours because I had only interacted with him for several weeks at that point and I needed some social time. He said that was fine--he's always said that would be fine (as if I needed his permission). So I went out.\n\n25 minutes away from home and nearly at my destination, he messages me about how he feels lonely, he's going back to his home country soon, he wishes I hadn't gone out, we don't have much time left together, we were supposed to spend the whole day together (this was news to me).\n\nIt takes a lot of effort for me to keep down the anxiety and just enjoy time with my friends before going home.\n\nWe argue for two hours about it, even though there are several times when I point out he's repeating himself, that HE said he didn't even know he would feel that way so how could I anticipate his needs? It occurred to me that he often would do that--wait until it was too late to change something, complain about it and make it my fault. Like when he accused me of leaving him alone to fend for himself at a party for an hour (it was 15 minutes, I was watching the clock knowing he was insecure and didn't like social gatherings), or that I was with my friend he didn't like the whole time (I talked to my friend for less than 5 minutes the whole night because I had one eye on the clock and the other on my boyfriend). Why didn't he get up and talk to me during the party and tell me that? Why did he wait until the party was over and we were home and he held it over my head? \n\nOr the time we got back from a tropical island and he says he \"wishes we could have relaxed more,\" when I was the one who planned the trip and was driving and why did it not occur to him to tell me at any time he just wanted to relax somewhere? I thought it was relaxing because he was just in the car talking with me and playing Pokemon Go anyway while I was doing the driving, was it really not that relaxing?\n\nOr that time he was mad at me ALL day because he thought I was mad at him and I had made some remark that he took personally (shock), and he didn't tell me why he was being quiet until hours later and after I pryed and begged for him to tell me.\n\nThis kind of shit. All the time, you guys, holy shit.\n\nThe day of the reckoning. He finally leaves my country. He's back in his home country. Messages me how he feels like he failed us and he doesn't want to be home. I respond compassionately but say he needs to get rest because he's been traveling so long and hasn't eaten and I wanted to give the discussion of his feelings the time and love they needed and we couldn't when it was 3 AM there and he had to be up for work at 7 AM.\n\nHe goes cold. He goes to bed.\n\nHe wakes up. Still cold. One-word answers. I'm used to it now.\n\nBut now I'm fed up. \n\nI call him out on his behavior. I tell him I'm sick of him going hot and cold with me. He says I didn't \"comfort\" him the way he wanted me to. I reiterate what I had said. He reiterates that it's not what he wanted to hear. \n\nWe break up later that day. We're both sad. Despite the bad times we had good times too, otherwise it would have been easier to let go. I'm disappointed in myself for saying I still didn't recognize the emotional abuse. I said we could try again. He says we couldn't. We both cry. We both apologize. We both thank each other for the good times.\n\nNext morning. He wakes up. Pissed. Mad I didn't give him a chance. Mad he has nothing to show for our relationship. Mad at all the sacrifices he made.\n\n(Sidenote: after the last fight I posted about, he had said to me: \"I look at all the sacrifices I've made and I wonder, what have you sacrificed? Are you worth it?\" To give you an idea, that is the most hurtful thing anyone has ever said to me, and it was the beginning of the end of our relationship. I opened up my home to him, cooked him vegetarian meals, tried to introduce him to other people so he didn't feel lonely, took him out and explored the country with him, tried to cheer him up, planned all our trips...it was NEVER enough. What was I sacrificing? My time. My energy. My mental health. My personal freedom. My social time with my friends. Everything.)\n\nIt was like he always expected the worst in me, and would only ever see what he wanted to see.\n\nSo we haven't talked since, after he chewed me up and spit me out and accused me of never listening to his feelings and always blaming him for everything. That I should have told him how I felt sooner, that I should have heard him out on an apology (that he apparently had no intention to actually get better from, just feel bad that it happened at all and repeat the same behaviors as infinitum).\n \nIf any of this rings true to you...please get out. I started reading, \"Why Does He Do That?\" since I saw it recommended on this sub several times a day. It's opening my eyes to what I put up with. The unhealthy behaviors. The emotional abuse. The mental exhaustion I have suffered.\n\nI won't lie. I miss who he was in the beginning. The sweet guy. The promises. The love. The care. The above-and-beyond romantic gestures. But they had vanished only months into the relationship--after we exchanged I love you's--and then the jealousy came out. The insecurity. Nitpicking what I said and how I said it. Even how I apologized wasn't good enough. His controlling tendencies. He demanded I not talk to my friends about it\u2014even after the break up he asked that I not talk to our mutual friends about our break up. \n\nI could never make him happy.\n\nPlease, please, if you read this and think it reminds you of your relationship...please know you can do better. I am single now and have been the last two weeks, but the moment we broke up I felt relief. I felt a weight being lifted off of me. I have my time again. I can do what I want, when I want, without worrying how he will feel or how he will react or how long our fight will last or trying to manage the anxiety he made me feel.\n\nIt can get better. \n\nLook up \u201csigns of emotional abuse\u201d and click the link with over 60 examples. Google \u201cwhy does he do that PDF\u201d and just read the first ten pages online. If it resonates with you, then know that you have taken a very essential first step towards a happier, healthier you.\n\nI know I still have some ways to go. I am still trying to convince myself it was an emotionally abusive relationship, that I was not overreacting, that I can't go back, that I can do better, that my future self deserves better, that he was not the one. I had been so sure he was. But I just have to keep trusting my gut. It's hard not messaging him. I feel pathetic for even considering it. I used to be stronger. Maybe I'm still strong. I just have to get it back. Keep practicing. Keep being strong.\n\nAnyway. Thank you for reading.\n\ntl;dr I left my emotionally abusive relationship. Thank you to everyone who messaged and helped me see what he was doing was not okay. Thank you for the brave people who post about their unhappiness with their spouses and helped me see things must be able to get better. For making me feel less alone. Just...thank you. &lt;3\n\nEdit: The overwhelming support. I can\u2019t keep up but I\u2019m reading every comment. Thank you for helping to convince me I\u2019m not crazy. Thank you for sharing your own painful stories. Thank you for reaching out and leaving comments or messages to send hope and love. Thank you for your support. You are all lovely people, and I hope you are all enjoying happy and healthy lives and relationships. Take care of yourselves.",

            "I'm so glad you're out.  Just one piece of advice- do tell your mutual friends.  \n\nTell the one you're closest to in that group of friends the full story.

You are allowed to be happy in your only life. If your partner can\u2019t give what you need, you have to leave. You can find a new way to be in a different form of relationship, where what you like in each other can stay intact (not with abusers though those have to go)\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be beaten to rock bottom. You are allowed to be happy. You are allowed to make choices that are good for you, just because you deserve it.

            "Hey, I just got out of a horribly abusive relationship myself, both sexual and emotional and so manipulative. One thing that hit me with your post; \"I miss the old him\" - I felt that way too, I missed who he was at the beginning when he was affectionate with me and understanding of my mental health and just all around really sweet and loving, but then I realised that him never existed. He was always the guy who abused me; he'd put his ex through similar shit and they broke up a year before I met him, tried to cheat on me right before we met the first time (ldr) while texting me how much he loves me the whole time, there were a lot of red flags in the beginning of the relationship I missed too. He was always a scummy person I was just blinded by love and wearing rose tinted glasses the whole time. The old him I fell in love with only existed as a front to lure me in and get me to be so infatuated with me he could abuse me as he wanted. The man (or boy from the sounds of it) you fell for probably never existed either, falling in love just blinds us to these things",

I'd make an innocuous comment or he'd ask me a question and I'd reply normally and he'd jump down my throat over my \"tone.\" It got to the point where I was training myself to speak in an overly peppy, upbeat cheerleader voice just to appease him and avoid a fight. I couldn't be myself. I'd ask an honest question and would get, \"What is that supposed to mean?!\" (it means ... I wanted to know what I asked you?) He would also do the thing where he'd try to pick a fight or ruin every night out I had. Even if he was invited. Sometimes he'd be invited, decide he didn't want to go, then send me sulky texts the entire time I was gone saying he wished he'd gone/wished I had cared enough to stay home with him. He'd do the same thing your ex did where we'd go on a trip, he'd seem to have fun/not speak up about what he wanted to do, then get home and complain he hadn't gotten to do x, y and z. ANYTHING so it was always my fault. He'd be upset and I'd comfort him and he'd get mad because I didn't do it right ... or something. A lot of refusing to tell me what he wanted but then getting mad when he didn't get it. Always my fault.\n\nI feel like that's emotionally abusive enough, but he would also criticize the fuck out of me. I am 5'3.\" When we dated I was hovering around 100 pounds, sometimes a bit less (I'm a small person with a small frame but I've always had actual curves -- really big boobs, no matter how skinny I've gotten). I'd be criticized for \"letting myself go\" if I didn't get to the gym on a given day. How he preferred girls with smaller chests (then ... go date one). How he preferred blondes (I have almost black hair ... maybe go date a blonde?). How maybe I shouldn't eat that sandwich because I didn't work out hard enough that day. How he didn't like \"how I hold my mouth\" (what?), how he didn't like my friends, how he didn't like how I pronounced a certain word, how he thought I was smarter than that. A lot of tearing me down and making me feel like shit. And if I got offended or hurt (or god forbid, cried, because crying was manipulative and he was just trying to be honest), I was the problem. So again, I was always the one who was wrong.\n\nI finally packed my shit and left and it was the best, most freeing thing I've ever done. Thank god. It freed me up to find my awesome husband who, after more than a decade together, still tells me how amazing he thinks I am. He's never criticized me or put me through any of that shit. (P.S. My ex got some of his friends to harass me and ask me why I was being so mean and why I broke his heart ... hope yours doesn't pull the same shit).\n\nI'm glad you got away from him.

            "Something that might help you is to remind yourself that you are never responsible for how someone else feels or for how they act. Every individual is the only person who can be responsible for themselves. That he was continuously trying to make his feelings and actions your responsibility is his failure. You might want to explore this pattern with a therapist - its possible that someone else in your life also behaves like this (maybe a parent?) and it \"trained\" you to be receptive to this type of behavior?\n\nI grew up with a parent who displayed these types of behaviors. I find the best way to deal with it when I encounter it in the wild is to take everything the person is saying at face-value and refuse to engage when they demand you put on an emotional display for them (the begging/apologizing/yelling/whatever). In other words, refuse to take responsibility and expect them to act like an adult. They will get frustrated with you for not playing along, and likely it will cause them to leave as a romantic partner, but considering their unsuitability as a romantic partner for you that's probably no great loss.",

Not exactly a teen, but still a bit young a stupid. We had a horrible breakup and I didn\u2019t date for 6 years.\nTo be fair, the relationship though amazing, sweet, and strong (we\u2019re both girls and our parents found out near the beginning. We were limited in when we could see each other and it was long distance) in the first year and a half or so, in the last.. 6 months or so it was just.. a lot of fighting. I\u2019m not saying she was innocent, because she wasn\u2019t (very defensive, didn\u2019t like to see different points of views, stubborn, etc.) but I know I clouded things. Our breakup led to me finally seeking help for my depression, which had gotten so bad that year I was just in a constant state of sensitivity, unhappiness, and hurt. My girlfriend was an amazing light, but in the end even that was filled. \n\nI\u2019ve fixed a lot since then. I recognized our love languages were different. If I had asked for my needs differently and if I had recognized her efforts from her own language, it would have saved a lot of grief. I\u2019ve learned how I need to recover from a fight or how to act after one. I learned not to be so sensitive. I\u2019m much healthier. I\u2019m in a new relationship now, 6 months, and it\u2019s gone well so far but I\u2019m still nervous of becoming what I was before like your ex boyfriend.\nBut I think self-reflection, time, and actual effort was/is needed to make a difference.\n\nIf he ever asks for you back, in a week or 5 years, don\u2019t take him back unless he owns up for his shit. And not just apologize, but explain what he did wrong and how he would do it differently. \nEven then, you deserve a healthier and happier relationship.\nI\u2019m sorry you went through this, again from me who was similar 6 years ago (I\u2019m almost 27 now), and I wish you the best of luck.

            "Girl, you are so strong!!! You did what you needed to do despite the knowledge that it would hurt really really badly. You did it anyway! That is courage. That is bravery. That is strength. You will be sad because of this and you will miss him horribly--in no way does that negate the strength and power that you displayed. If you weren't sad that would not be good. The pain and sadness that you are feeling is the natural and correct response to losing someone. It takes a whole lot of guts to leave someone because you know you're worth better. And you did that. Strength is not in not having the feelings--it's doing what you know is right DESPITE knowing that it sucks.",

The details you post above don't really matter at the end of the day other than you don't like the hot/cold treatment.   I can't stand the passive aggressive crap either.\n\n\nA reason I'm posting is \"the tone\" statements.  My last 3 relationships have had that commented about.  The first time I'm like \"WTF is this BS you don't like my tone?\".   But in hindsight, I think there is something to it.   I think there are ways to say things... and there is body language, facial expressions, etc that are communicating things I don't intend.   I have a poor \"poker face\" if you will.\n\n\nAll of that doesn't matter when it comes to your ex, but I'm pointing this out so that for the next person you are mindful about it.  If something is getting under your skin about the person you are with you need to find ways to communicate that and address it.  Otherwise the \"oh you are up\" statements are potentially going to come across in a way you don't believe you are fronting.\n\nbest of luck!",

I was *always* the bad guy when we argued, I was *always* the one apologising a thousand times and he always took anything I said way too personally. But the thing that got to me the most, is that whenever he said something that hurt me and he knew it, he\u2019d just change the topic and come up with a load of jokes and pretend to be completely oblivious. If I ever spoke about how I felt, again he\u2019d take it personally and act like the victim, saying stuff like \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not good enough for you\u201d and all that nonsense. \n\nThe final straw for me and when I realised it was a toxic relationship is when I was going through a really low point with my depression, I opened up to him and just wanted his support, I told him I wasn\u2019t happy with the way my life was going (not having a job, not having any friends other than him etc) and instead of being understanding like he used to be, he *FLIPPED* and took it so personally, he was so mean and said horrible things, he even had the audacity to say that I hurt him. Normally that reaction would\u2019ve upset me, made me cry and I\u2019d just go quiet and say sorry but not that time. I was so unbelievably angry so I finally stood up to him, I told him he was taking it too personally and making it all about him, playing the victim and all that. He seemed surprised and shocked, I guess he was expecting me to just cower like usual so for once in the relationship he apologised but it didn\u2019t feel honest to me at all, it was meaningless and too late. The next day I received some gifts in the post from him but that just made me even more angry, did he really think he could buy me? Buy my forgiveness? That\u2019s when I ended it. \n\nIt\u2019s been 6 months since and I\u2019ve never felt so free and happy.

            "I'm really really proud of you for getting out of that, honestly.\n\n I've been battling closing my chapter with my ex who reminds me a lot of yours. Except he was just always cold, I was more the sensitive one but I'd try to come up with ways to be close and spend time together and ask where he was at, and if I said the tiniest little thing, bam, he was angry. And he would yell at me for being too sensitive because I'd break down in tears when of that happened. \n\nI couldn't even go see my grandmother for an hour (which with my depression is all I can manage, little bursts of time) because \"it only takes an hour to fuck someone and sometimes you come back with food or money.\" My gram and me would sometimes go get Panera bread together and whenever i was in between jobs, gram would give me a 20 for gas for the week.\n\nI figured maybe just going on a drive on my backroads would be a safe decision to make because there are no people and I'm not in any social situation. Can just zone out, stare at the road and crank my music up. Nope. Still cheating I guess, so my drives did not continue and to this day give me anxiety. \n\nI woke up early to make him pancakes since he had gotten up early to make me coffee for work, I thought I'd repay him and make him something nice. We then argued for 8 hours over the \"cum looking \" substance on my hoodie. And he was furious with me that when I looked at it I said \"no that doesn't look like cum. That's chalky, like paint or something. I don't know. But I have never cheated on you, I don't understand\" come to the end of the fight, he crouches down next to my crying mess on the couch (I have horrendous anxiety and fights really hurt) and he calmly says with even a slight smile, \"I realized half way through the argument that its pancake batter on your hoodie. Not cum. I was just too far in to pull back.\" 8 hours of screaming and fighting and accusations and horribly mean words at me, just for him to have known what it was all along. \n\nHell, any joke I made that was light poking and the usual relationships joke, he'd snap and say \"there's truth behind every joke.\"\n\nWe even experienced a miscarriage together for an unknown pregnancy. I was at a crappy job and we were in the midst of the fights. After after miscarriage passes, I still have yet to accept what it was and (yes this happened) i convinced myself i drank too much ginger ale and that's why the bleeding wouldn't stop, and the pain and symptoms I saw were completely stress and exhaustion related. I'd go from being screamed at at the hen house I worked at (only worked with young 20 something year old women who constantly bickerwd) to back to his apartment to be screamed at. He told me he knew around the 4 day of bleeding what it was, but couldn't accept it, so he yelled at me out of anger to that (actually told me this) \n\nLately, as the chapter is coming to a close, he'll say something that I've reminded him several times upsets me, which mostly consists of him insulting himself, his dick, and our sex life. Last night he made a comment that made me kinda sad, and he said \"you don't have to start an argument so we won't have sex. I'm not going to try anything.\" And it was so far out of left field I just had to take a minute and try to connect how we got from point A all the way to point Z there. \n\nThe mental and emotional mind games has taken a horrible toll on me and I've isolated myself incredibly. I really hope you're finding the strength to go back out and see the ones you love and never question your worth because he decided to play with it.  Please consider maybe therapy because the constant emotional and mental jabs he did could effect your view on things. I hope you're healing well and doing okay. You now have the ability to be the best you that you can be. Stay safe out there (: \n\n\nP.s. sorry about how long, and format. On phone and a little exhausted.",

But he could say rude things and would expect me to get over it immediately.\n\nOne time he sent me a snap of him the day after he had a party wearing sunglasses that were very obviously female sunglasses (big, cheetah print, diamond edging) so I said \u201chaha nice glasses! Did some girl leave them after your party last night?\u201d And he iced me for 2 days. No explanation. I was so confused and he wouldn\u2019t answer me when I reached out. Finally days later he says something along the lines of I\u2019m rude for saying they are girls sunglasses because they\u2019re actually his (honest mistake lol). \n\nYou\u2019re better off without him, it gets so tiring/annoying apologizing for stupid shit all the time.",

I\u2019m (57M) and she (58F) and it really sounds just like us with different settings. We\u2019ve been together almost 5 years and engaged 7 months ago. It was on again and off again for nearly the same small BS arguments and fights. Behavior and actions I could never place my finger on. It just always comes back to me not being sensitive or not knowing how to be in a relationship. The one word answers, the silent treatment, me asking what\u2019s wrong, did I say or do something. It\u2019s always no until a day or two later. Mostly later. Then when it comes out it\u2019s BS! Things I never said or did. If I challenge or bring anything up she immediately becomes defensive and out talks me 10-1. I end of getting mad or walk away then feel like I did something wrong and apologize. Only for something to happen again within 14 days. I should have know, normal couple do, or what have you sacrificed....  I\u2019ve often thought she may be narcissistic but the other side of her has the heart of a little girl. So sweet one moment and maybe 10 min later I\u2019d swear I don\u2019t know her. One time her face looked so troubled she looked like someone else. I know I\u2019m not the perfect, not even close perfect guy. But I can listen, I can explore myself, I can take advice from my men friends like when they tell me I owe and apology.... but she absolutely can not look at herself in this way. The first year we were together she could do this and did do this, then it completely stopped. I know relationships need work and the best ones have had problems. I don\u2019t want to be a quitter like my dad but I too am at the end of my rope.",

It isolates you from friends and family and makes you reliant on him. It's a tactic so women wont leave. And when they do anyway? Last ditch manipulation. You have to show him it wont work.

It makes you doubt yourself when you know you are right. You idealize the person as who you thought they were and don't see them as who you've learned they are.

It took a lot of strength to get out and stay out, and it's all you can do. After a while I was just me again and I can't imagine going back and I'm so grateful I didn't because it was always just a few thumb clicks away. Stay strong, you know what you deserve and it's not to be constantly fucked with  for the purpose of curing someone else's insecurities.

They had too much communication issues, they couldn't work on it because of how the other talks or whatever and they get defensive and argue for nothing. Kind of like what you just said.

For 5 years I had put up with a man (acted like a child), who lived off of me and my family in my home, was disrespectful to my parents, emotionally hurtful to me, and took absolutely 0 responsibility for anything in his life. It was all video games and sitting on good computer all day, no matter how much I begged him to get a job, go to school, do something with his life, he refused or lied about it.  I kept thinking I could change him, help him grow into who I wanted him to be. The problem is he never grew up and never wanted to, but I did and our relationship became a chain and ball that weighed me down and held me back. It took almost dying to make me realize he would never be there when I needed him, and no matter how much I loved him, he would never love me enough to change. So I left, I kicked him out after he decided to make fun of me for being scared of driving after the nearly fatal car crash, and you described it perfectly, I felt a huge relief as I let him go, I could focus on myself. And I did, I excelled at my job, got my own place, and met my now boyfriend who is do wonderful and 100x more mature and thoughtful than he could ever be.

            "Oh man. That thing about you not \"comforting\" him the way he wanted you to- the exact thing happened to me during the end of my last relationship. He was upset about something and I was offering suggestions to help him get through it and trying to be supportive, even though I was already mentally drained from dealing with his attitude in the days beforehand and I was tiptoeing around him at that point to make sure nothing I said upset him. Of course he did get upset, and was pissed I didn't just comfort him, which I thought I had but I guess he just wanted me to say something like \"everything's gonna be okay sweetie\" which is not normal coming from me at all, especially when he was just complaining about band practice or school or something and I was trying to be realistic since he constantly went on about that stuff and as much as I would talk it through with him he would never do a thing to make it easier on himself. \n\nHe didn't do the whole taking things I said as offensive thing but that bit about the \"comfort\" really struck a chord with me. It really boiled down to him not respecting me as an individual with my own reactions to things and my own way of handling problems- I'm not gonna be clingy or super cuddly or say a bunch of mushy things in hopes of making you feel better. It's just not who I am and all of those were things he tried to force me to be. Obviously there was more to it than that but that was pretty much the final straw. We're staying friends and that's been fine so far because I think he just had this idea of a \"girlfriend\" that I didn't fit because I'm actually a person with my own personality.\n\nGood on you for getting out of that situation. I know it sucks but it's crazy how much can change after you're single, like you don't even realize how much of your life had been affected by being in a bad relationship.",

People who don't have confidence in their own emotions will send to grasp onto someone else who will allow them to take advantage of them emotionally like an emotional vampire. A big mistake in relationships is arguing with \"you\" statements instead of \"I\" statements. He's had some sort of trauma in the past for this behavior to continue on. Also another warning sign in any relationship is moving too fast. Always have a guard on you and get to know them before jumping in so quickly. That's how relationships fail. If he doesn't fix his own problems, he will do the exact same thing to somebody else.",

I was torn between sheepishly asking my company to withdraw the transfer, or going ahead and moving alone to what felt like my ex's city. Either way, the clock was ticking on my apartment lease. The anxiety was keeping me up at night and the lack of sleep only made things worse. \n\nOn top of that, it was tough knowing that I was probably the only one sad about the breakup while my ex was living his best life, partying with best friends and banging hot chicks, relieved to be rid of me. So...yeah. That felt like shit.\n\nIn the meantime I threw myself into work to keep my mind off things. That's when things took a crazy turn because one of my projects garnered a lot of attention. It led to me writing a report that made its way to a member of upper management. Lo and behold, a few weeks later a management position opened up that I was uniquely qualified for...and the interviewer was that same person who liked my report.\n\nSo I got the job! And when they told me that I would need to relocate to our home office in the Bay Area (I work in biotech), I was able to tell them that all my stuff was already packed and ready to go. Thanks, ex!\n\nSo now, instead of Dallas, I'll be moving to the Bay Area in a few weeks. One of my best friends is coming along for the ride. We're going to make an epic road trip out of it and hit a few national parks along the way.\n\nSince we had fully expected to move in together, my SO had taken some of my belongings down with him. I've paid about $500 so far to get my shit shipped back. My kitchen stuff and some pieces of furniture are forfeit. He has yet to return my gaming consoles. We really should have split it, but I knew he'd turn that into a back-and-forth that I didn't want to deal with. Tbh, there's also enough of a difference in our budgets that $500 to me is not as big a deal as $250 would be to him. (It's yet another blessing that we never merged our finances.)\n\nI've reminded him a few times about the rest of my stuff and he keeps telling me he'll get it to me. I *really* don't want to have to come down there with a police escort to take back my property, but it's looking like I might have to. I don't know why he has to make this so difficult, but I'm getting pissed. \n\nSo if anyone has any advice to share on that...\n\nI know I'll never know his true thinking, but honestly who cares at this point?\n\nI've also decided I'm not going to try to date for another year at least. I've been told that my management role is likely to be upgraded to a director role, depending on my performance review. So work will probably take up a lot of my time. Any remaining time I have, I want to fully devote to forming friendships. \n\nBut most importantly, if you couldn't already tell, it's clear that I have some serious work to do on self-worth and boundaries.\n\nFTR, I think it's important to note that it's not like this guy was a deadbeat loser. I know it's easy to think, \"Why is this woman dating an asshole?\" when you read these posts, but it's rarely that simple. Everyone who met him loved him. We shared a lot of common interests. He was fun to be around, always happy, great to talk to, supportive of my career, a fantastic cook, very organized, came from a great family, had a good job, all of that.\n\nHowever, there's no denying that I was in a long-term relationship with someone who consistently took *way* more than they gave. Like, on every level. And he himself would admit that.\n\nI want to take this time to work on myself so that I never accept that kind of situation again.\n\nBuuuuut, when I do decide to put myself out there again, it's the Bay Area. God knows there will be plenty of guys around who also get Asian glow and will understand why I'm not drinking lol\n\nCheers, everyone! \ud83e\udd42\n\n**Tl;dr** We broke up. Went through a terrible couple months. Drowned myself in work to cope. Hard work paid off and I landed a major promotion that will take me to the Bay Area instead. Learned an expensive lesson about letting an SO move your things. Hoping he doesn't make me come down there, but I know it's all going to be good in the end. Gonna take the next year to be single and work on myself, but life is looking up.",

I\u2019m a drinker myself, more than I probably should, and I can\u2019t imagine my husband not drinking bothering me for a single second. If he didn\u2019t like to go out or refused to engage in get-togethers, that\u2019d be one thing, but that wasn\u2019t you at all. You still liked to go out and get together and have fun, you just weren\u2019t drunk. Sounds like zero compatibility issues for someone who isn\u2019t a jackass, to be honest. I don\u2019t care how much my husband drinks; I\u2019m only interested in how compatible we are with reading at pubs or hosting small parties or getting together with friends. I couldn\u2019t care less what his alcohol intake is during those times.\n\nYou\u2019ll find someone much better, and until then, you just keep living your best life with no hangovers, friend!",

We go out sometimes and he has a few drinks and I either have one or don\u2019t drink at all and everyone\u2019s happy regardless (and we save money!). Any person worth pursuing a relationship with in the first place won\u2019t see your inability to drink as a downside.\n\nAgreed with some of the commenters on your original post that he was unfortunately probably just looking for a reason to break it off anyway or wasn\u2019t ready to commit and was using that as an excuse.

I think your plan to work on just developing a friend circle while figuring out your relationship patterns is a good one.   \n\nRe getting back your stuff,  I don't want to be insensitive, but is anything there worth flying back for?  Or are there things of sentimental /personal value?  If it is stuff with monetary value, You might want to ask r/legaladvice if there is a legal way to recover it.  If it's the latter, is he just being lazy because he knows you are far away?  Then give him a  deadline with a consequence?  Or is he someone who chronically can't get his shit together?    You might be able to hire one of those organizer types to take a list  and pack it up.",
            "Looks like the breakup was a \"good\" thing for you.   \nAny guy who breaks up over such a dumb reason is immature. Even tho it most likely the main reason was him being out drinking, being a ladiesman and having fun. In a few years this wont be so fun anymore.  \nGood riddance. And good thing will come for you.

            "Coming from a long line of alcoholics, the chaos, sadness, and the feeling of helplessness when your loved one is calling you from a place where not even he knows where he's at, is a NIGHTMARE.\n\nMy father says that alcoholism is basically similar to having a \"mistress.\"  It will tear up your family, you will lose close friendships and bonds with other loved ones and your life will basically be ruined because of it.  Well, there's that and the fact that you will die a slow and agonizing death when your liver and other organs begin to shut down.  You will eventually end up in one of two places.....prison or a coffin.\n\nPlease, honey....you're bf doesn't sound like a keeper.  The mere fact that he doesn't respect your actual physical reaction to alcohol speaks volumes about his character.  It sounds like this guy is trying to relive his glory days with his frat boy mentality is ridiculous.  Let him find someone that shares his yen for \"partying\" and \"whooping it up.\"  Before long, that's going to get OLD and he's going to realize that he let go of a good woman for the wrong reasons.  He needs to grow up or he's in for a world of hurt if goes down the \"night train.\"  \n\nI'll admit, I do have an occasional drink every now and then but witnessing the downward spiral that one particular loved one flew into, was HELL.  The not knowing where he was when he would call me on his benders and the fact that I live 4 hours away from him tore away at my soul.  Sadly, I prepared myself for the \"phone call.\"  The phone call that was either going to tell me that my brilliant, successful attorney brother had killed someone while driving, had died while driving drunk or that he went to jail.  I finally did receive the call that he went to jail.  Felony arrest for evading the police while the idiot tried to get away by driving like a lunatic.  He still didn't learn his lesson and kept drinking.  Apparently, rock bottom for him is actually an abyss with nowhere to finally land.  My heart aches everyday for him but all I can do is hope that he's ready to help himself.\n\nBest of luck to you, OP.",

            "Last year I had major surgery (fine now) but dropped like 45lbs that I did not need to loose. Because I was extremely underweight my body did not process alcohol the same when. Before I could slam down shots all night and be decent, now one glass of wine made me violently ill. I just started being able to drink again but during that time my SO and the new group of friends we just met (we moved east to west 6 months before I needed surgery knew no one) where nothing but supportive , since we lived in a weed legal state they would buy me drinkables when we had parties. My SO bought me fancy cane sodas so I could drink something when he had a beer at the end of the day. It isn't normal for loved ones to make you feel that way, stay strong love!!

But if drinking and screwing lots of women is what defines your \"best life\" - at some point that's just kind of sad.\n\nThen I read on, and found myself nodding along thinking \"yeah, YOU!

We were young, had a rough job, and we liked to go out at night. He even had a part-time job as a bartender and then after that, a part-time job as a bouncer (after our full-time jobs!). You can imagine then that that means I do enjoy alcohol.\n\nFast forward to now. My fianc\u00e9 is ***severely*** allergic to alcohol. Like, he gets a whiff of it and he goes into shock. This happened the minute he turned thirty years old. You can imagine that it changed our lifestyle a tiny bit. But was it even a thought, really? Did I anguish over the fact that he can\u2019t drink anymore? No, now I ask waiters if there is alcohol in anything they are cooking back there. I buy alcohol-free vanilla extract for when I bake. I literally only care about it to the extent that I would like him not to die. (He\u2019s also allergic to garlic and onions, so the alcohol thing is the least hard thing to monitor!)\n\nIf I want to drink, I can drink with friends or family. He doesn\u2019t judge that I can still drink. We are both happy, healthy, and we love each other. In the scheme of things, our relationship hardly changed.

You still can enjoy all the nightlife you want and stay true to water or one nursed drink (water, ice in a short glass with a twist of lemon or olive looks like vodka on the rocks). There will be lots to do in the Bay Area. And I bet your income is nothing to sneeze at either! Good move on your part (leaving Mr. Everybody-Loves-Me-Especially-Me)",

I just tell them that my choice to be sober shouldn\u2019t affect how they feel and I don\u2019t need alcohol to have fun. That said, you can always ask for non-alcoholic versions of drinks - my favorite is a Caesar and no one aside from the bar tender and myself knows it\u2019s virgin. \n\nEither way, good on you for landing the new job and learning valuable lessons about dead beats.",
            "You're going to be loving life too much to care about this POS. Anyone who repeatedly pressures you to do stuff you don't want to and knows its bad for you is no friend of yours, let alone an acceptable life partner. Your ex was doing you a favor cutting his dead weight loose from you. Such behavior shows a pretty blatant lack of respect for you as a person and just general human empathy. If he or anybody can't wrap their brain around the idea that drinking alcohol is just a completely miserable experience for people like us, they can get lost.\n\nA lot of my friend-circle liked binge drinking at your guy's age still. But the ones who were true friends knew not to pressure me too much into drinking because I have the same problems with it as you. I have some friends who drink through the Asian Glow, but it's just not worth it for me. Pretty much all of them managed to grow up over the course of the next 5 or so years though. Growing older, furthering your carrier, getting married, and having kids means you don't get to black out every night without consequence. As you get older, the same will happen with your peer group too and social functions will get even better because nobody gets drunk anymore and you can play games or have intelligent conversations instead of cleaning up after people and keeping them from getting puke in their hair.\n\nYou're going to love the Bay Area! I'm actually pretty jealous of you, I loved my time there. The climate is amazing, there's a bajillion things to do, the region is full of amazing people who will all be way more worth your time than your loser-ex, and there's going to be a lot more opportunities for advancing your career there. You're going to have a blast! Best of luck!!!",

I describe it as never hitting the fun part of drinking and instead going straight to the pain part of being hungover. Not a perfect explanation but it usually gets the point across to drinkers.\n\nI don't know if it helps or not (your attitude is already fantastic!) but you can boil your situation with him down to his priorities. The party lifestyle was more important to him than your relationship, and neither of you deserve that. Additionally, you're just not into partying and he is, so you have a disconnect in lifestyles. That's a big hurdle for a relationship. \n\nThat's not even to mention how crappy he's acted. I'd say he's got a lot of growing up to do. It sounds like he was (and is) unconcerned with your feelings, which you also don't deserve. Now he's prioritizing his partying over sending you your property too and that's just shitty. You made the right choice in not trying to save that relationship. \n\nDepending on the importance of the things he won't send, you can always consult a lawyer and/or sue him in small claims if it gets to that. \n\nIt's so good to hear that you're doing so well! You should definitely feel good about nailing that job. Not enough people give themselves credit when they're awesome.\n\nEdit: Oh, and I'm engaged to a drinker so it can be done.

I found out that if you let them, people will use your good nature and generosity without giving much back, and it's easy to feel manipulated and resentful. But a lot of those people will back off immediately and start being respectful as soon as you start demanding it. I always found that sad, but am getting over it.

            "I went through a really devestating break up at 25 just as I quit my job, moved to a new city, and went back to university. I absolutely threw myself into school work and self care. I promised myself absolutely no dating until i got my emotional shit together and started seeing a therapist bi-weekly and doing a lot of reading. It took a lot of work to really feel my self-worth and value as both a person and a partner but it came around. A year later I was much healthier (emotionally anyway, I still ate garbage), happier, and my sister introduced me to a lovely woman who has since become my wife and our daughter turns one tomorrow. \n\nYou've done the self-loathing bit now use it as a fresh start to dust yourself off and evaluate your emotional health. Use this opportunity to dive into your work and have a kick-ass career, and even more stellar personal life. You're worth it.",

That probably wouldnt have lead to a good place. Also, well done recognising that he takes more than he gives. Your future sounds really bright. \n  \nHave you got your important stuff back?

We broke up and got back together where my medicine changed, and the side affects were awful. The told me \"drunk sex is more fun\" and then got mad at me when we went out somewhere that I got blackout drunk from their house wine and I got so sick we obviously weren't having sex. \nAt first, it feels awful to lose someone you love, but after you take those rose colored glasses off,you realize how wrong that person was in general, and for you. \n\nCongrats on that job, OP.

            "So glad to hear it worked out for you. And I understand that he might be a redeemable guy in some lights. \n\nBut alcohol is literal poison to everyone eventually, not just people like you. And even if people seemingly have non-problematic relationships with it, choosing it over an ENTIRE romantic relationship is a BAD SIGN. Especially since he  knew from day one and NEVER talked to you about this concern. \n\nAlso, while I think it's great for you to take some time off and wprk on yourself...it's important top remember that you didn't do anything wrong and that self development doesn't happen with the calendar - for example, you probably matured more in the week surrounding your break up than in the entirely of the relationship. So I guess...don't be surprised if at some point before a year is up you feel ready or different. And that might be the perfect time to move on even if it doesn't fit your schedule that you make right now. More than an anount of time, I encorage you to set actual goals for what this self-development looks and feels like to you. And maybe a big part of that IS time spent alone - but just setting a calendar date can lead to some issues. \n\nJust to give an example, I once moved to a city that I didn't like. I wanted to give it a good try, so I said I needed to be there at least 6 months. As soon as it struck midnight and I realized 6 months was up, I decided I wanted to go home. Great! But the reality is that I knew long before that that I wanted to leave and there was nothing magical about that date other than it set up a subconscious reality of \"just wait it out/you just have to make it til X\" and that's no way to live what should otherwise be a fun part of life. \n\nI think it's really smart to take your time and space and find out what you really want. And if the calendar works as a motivator for you that's great! Just make sure you are actually trying to grow, not just putting yourself in time out.",
            "He's shallow, move on.  Problem solved.  There's no philosophy behind picking up your bag and walking away from someone who has no more respect for you than that.  Swallow the nail and move on.

            "It sounds like you have a really exciting opportunity! Congratulations! There is a lot of cultural pressure around drinking in the US, and it can feel weird and isolating to not drink - especially if \"friends\" or a SO is pressuring you.

I do drink, but sometimes I don't drink at all at parties or maybe have one drink to sip on throughout the entire night. If people don't like it, guess what, that says way more about their insecurities and lack of social skills than it does about me. I don't need alcohol to have fun, and you shouldn't feel bad about your condition.

I never knew. 5pm? 6? 8? 10? Never ever knew.\n\nAnyway, when I found a girl hidden in his phone under a guys name, for a second time... I sat and I waited.\n\nI approached him calmly, and he kicked me out of \"his\" house and would not allow me to get my things back and if I turned up the neighbours would be watching and would call the.

I spoke to him about it again, and said we need to come up for a solution because I couldn\u2019t go on with such little help anymore. \n\nWe wrote a list as someone had suggested . (Sorry I don\u2019t know how to link usernames) and I wrote what I do and he wrote what he did. My list was much bigger than his and he said he didn\u2019t realise How \u2018unequal\u2019 the lists were and he thought we were doing pretty much the same. He thanked me for everything I did, and said he\u2019d change.\n\nWe take it in turns with the nappy changes and the story times etc and it\u2019s working very well.\n\nNow we have certain things we both need to get done. He will bath the kids on the nights he\u2019s home so he gets to spend more one on one time. He\u2019ll read stories and is being much more involved.\n\nI still do a lot which I\u2019m fine with, (the things SAHP do) but I want to stay home with the kids and do the majority as I feel that\u2019s what I\u2019m happiest with doing. I\u2019m just appreciative of the help he\u2019s now giving me. I don\u2019t feel alone anymore. \n\nI think with a new baby and a toddler and working full time, it was getting a bit on top of him but we communicate better and when he\u2019s feeling overwhelmed, I\u2019ll do more and vice versa.\n\nI do think I have to ask him some things still, but I feel like that only happens when we have had a bit of a busy/hard day. but we have more of an understanding of one another now. \n\nWe also read the articles commenters recommended and that is definitely in the back of our mind. \n\nI do feel I got into the habit of doing things myself and would bathe and read, etc without really giving him that time and now I\u2019m encouraging him even more to do things one on one with the kids. As I was always there when he was spending time with them, I\u2019m trying to make it where he actually gets alone time with them as well. As I think that was making him feel like a \u201csecondary \u201c parent if that makes sense. He has a much better bond with the kids now, and we are all so much happier. As a family and us as a couple. \n\nI might have missed things so if you wanna know anything else ill answer.\nI know this isn\u2019t the most amazing update and it\u2019s just a case of communicating better but you\u2019ve all helped so much and I\u2019m very appreciative. I love reddit!\n\nThanks for all your comments/advice. \n\n\nTLDR : a case of communicating better and following your advice has helped us thanks so much \n",

Being the SAHP does not mean all things parenting are your domain for him to help with, which I think you recognize, but it will be useful to the both of you if you watch for little ways where you may still have remnants of this mindset. \n\nYou\u2019re moving in the right direction and kudos to both of you for working on this. It\u2019s especially great that you\u2019re both working to improve his bond with the kids. ",
            "This is absolutely an amazing update!  It shows how communication has to be consciously and conscientiously worked at by both partners.  And when it is, everyone's happiness increases, and the hard work of raising a family becomes easier when an overall balance is achieved.  You two are flexible as needed.  And you are not falling into the trap of excusing the breadwinner from all care of the children.  And over time, the SAHP can take on some income producing work as well, if it is mutually agreed upon.  And if you are applying the same teamwork on creating and maintaining a budget that you both agree upon, then you are exceptional.\n\nUnfortunately, my partner and I were not great communicators, avoided resolving issues, and ended in divorce.  Looking back, I can understand why we failed, since we both came from dysfunctional families.  So I think you two are way ahead of the game of life, thanks to Reddit!  ",
            "I\u2019m glad things are working out for you guys.  \n\nThis part stood out to me though:\n\n>\tI\u2019m just appreciative of the help he is now giving me.\n\nIt might be useful to get out of this mindset. Yes, it is good he is stepping up, but it isn\u2019t a favor to you, he is just finally doing his fair share.",
            "Another good thing to remember is that being in charge is also an item on the list. Partners often forget that because they don\u2019t realise how much energy it takes to have pay attention to what needs to be done. ",
            "Great update! I hate to say I\u2019m working on not being the husband from the original post. Not saying your husband is a bad person he\u2019s not at all! I was just ignorant to all the work my wife did.\n\nMy wife has noticed improvement and I hope to keep doing better.",
            "How lovely that everything worked out so well. Cheers to you and your family, great job on communication.",
            "This is a great update! My husband and I also had growing pains with the kids, I\u2019m also a SAHP but we\u2019re somewhere around 14 years in, 10 married, our oldest is 8. I haven\u2019t had resentment in years.\n\nThere\u2019s an amount of work that a household requires and each partner should be doing a roughly equal amount of it. Bringing in money is a huge chunk of the work, but it\u2019s not half \u2014 there\u2019s still plenty of parenting and household maintenance (cleaning, cooking, etc) to do when he\u2019s not at work. Looking at it this way has really helped to even out the workload.\n\nAnother thing that really helps both of us is that we each get time on the weekends (my husband works during the week) to ourselves. It\u2019s not enough, but our youngest is still a toddler; it\u2019ll get better later on.",

            "I've been dealing with this exact same thing at home (but we don't have kids) we both work, he works longer hours and uses that as an excuse to do NOTHING at home. I mean I ask him to take out the trash and he practically throws a tantrum. Weeds in the yard and he refuses to pick up his dog shit. I'm home more so I don't mind cleaning more. I felt to petty, like I was just being some crazy women for thinking about breaking up with him over this. I've talked to him so many times and he just brushes it off like I need to get over it.

            "Hi, just out of curiosity, has your boyfriend been diagnosed, or shown any symptoms of ADD/ADHD? People with ADD can sometimes have a difficult time realizing what needs to be done in their environment. My wife often gets frustrated with me when she has to prompt me to do things. I can be sitting in my home with dozens of things that need to be done but have no ability to know where to start, what to start, or if I need to start now or do it later. Its not that I'm lazy, I just don't ever know what I should be doing ",

You are doing great!\n\n\nI am a big fan of weekly check ups, to check in with feelings, validations, thank yous, preparation for the future (there's going to be over time /three kids birthday party next week) and you are really a team, as you say!\n\n\nI also recommend buying a cake and celebrating with your husband. You are working through your problems as adults and that is fucking awesome. \n\n\nI think anyone who is/has been a parent of a baby/and/or toddler will testify to the how the struggle is real.\n\n\nIn fact I think every damn parent in here deserves a cake.

If you want something for the house or kids that's great. But chances that's your agenda, and then rightfully he should pursue his agenda (bass boat, trail runner, green fees, motercross, rifle, sporting tickets, etc). Unless he's asking you for time with his agenda, you better not overstep your welcome and ask him for time with yours. Make sure it's a two way street."
