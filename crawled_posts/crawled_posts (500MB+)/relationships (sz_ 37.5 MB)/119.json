        "selftext": "My husband doesn't like to go out much. It's not something that I've ever faulted him for or been mad at him about. We've never gotten in fights about it til now and it's something he told me upfront when we had first gotten in the relationship 4 years ago. \"I'm never going to be the kind of person that likes to go out a lot, I just want to hang out at home\" and I of course said that it was fine because that's not a flaw to me, it's just a character trait. \n\n\nI used to suffer from depression due to a lot of traumas in my life. I found it really hard to go outside at all, and especially alone. I missed out on a lot of experiences because of this. In our first year of dating, he got me to have more confidence in myself so I stopped hiding. I got a therapist and have been on a wonderful little antidepressant. We got married one year later and I'm still happier than I have ever been, and I'm incredibly grateful to have him in my life. That hasn't changed one bit.\n\n\nNow, I know that this isn't want he does. I know that he doesn't stay inside because he's depressed, it's because it's in his nature to be a housecat. And like I said, I'm still fine with that. Lately he's not okay with me doing this, though. \n\n\nIf I ask him if he wants to see a movie with me and he said \"no\" or the more common, \"I don't know, maybe\" I'll usually ask him two more times and then if he still says no or \"maybe\" I'll go by myself. It's the same with going out to dinner, taking little classes, etc. We had fun with this at first. I would come home from doing the thing and then I would excitedly tell him what I'd done and the people I'd met. He'd happily listen and hug me and kiss me on the forehead. It was a really beautiful thing. At one point we called it \"my little adventures\" and I would take polaroid pictures and show them to him and then hang them on the kitchen wall. It was a seriously beautiful point in our relationship and the times that we would go out and take polaroids together were some of the happiest times in my life. I even made it a point to have us do / go to things that *he* liked to do. It was great. It was seriously so great.\n\n\nAbout two years ago I asked him, \"Hey, I've been really passionate about learning a language and eventually going to this languages place of origin. Do you want to study it with me and then go there too?\" and he said no to the language, but maybe to going with me. \n\n\nCut to now and I'm pretty damn good at this language. I decided about four months ago that I am going to this place. I asked him and he would still like to come with me and he said no and got kind of upset that I had learned this language without him. \"You're the one that's going to know anything, there's really no point in me going.\" I was kind of taken aback because during the process he was really supportive. I didn't really push it, but I apologized and went somewhere else to clear my head about things and we were fine later on that day. I bought the tickets for me and my mother to go \"the place\" about four weeks ago and ever since then, things have been really tense. If I ask him to do minor things, like come to the grocery store with me, he gets a bit of an attitude. I can tell that he knows this is ridiculous though, because he'll say sorry almost immediately and be sad and quiet the rest of the time.\n\n\nI've tried to talk to him about what's bothering him, but he keeps either saying that it's nothing and he doesn't want to talk about it, or will tell me not to press it and then get mad and leave. I don't know what to do at this point. Our relationship has been so great, but I can feel things being strained. I can feel him kind of slipping away. I don't know what to do. I thought about buying him a ticket to \"the place\" anyway and surprising him, because I really would love it if he could go with me and I know for a fact it's somewhere he's always been interested in. But I also don't want to force him, because I hate forcing people to do things. However, I also don't want to do stop having these experiences for myself just because he doesn't want to. I've never faulted him for wanting to be at home, so why is he faulting me for wanting to be outside? I don't know how to talk to him or what to say. If I have to stop doing things, then... I guess I will? But I also feel bad for having to stop, but it's not worth getting a divorce over or having things escalate that bad. I just don't know what to do or where to go from here.\n\n**Edit/Update:** Hi! Um, we had a bit of a long talk. I'm kind of a mix of exhausted / drained / excited now so I apologize if I make a lot of typos or word something wrong. In a kind of big nutshell: He said he feels like he's drowning in my success. I said I would learn a language and I did it. I said I would lose 180lbs and I did it earlier in our relationship and got the skin surgery. I have a pretty stress free job and it's getting to him. He's been trying really hard to just be happy but it's hard. He understands that it's wrong to feel this way and between feeling guilty about it and feeling this way at all, it's just been taking its toll. He also has a skin condition that makes him feel cautious of going outside, especially in another country. :( I never thought this would be the problem, because he's always acted as though it's not a bother to him at all and he doesn't care.  He's going to keep trying though, and to seek therapy independent of me because he thinks that he also may really be suffering from depression.\n\n\nNow, I have to say that we *do* have communication problems. Our friendship (two years before dating) started off long distance in an mmorpg so we're still kind of better with text-talking than outloud speaking. Sometimes we have a hard time saying when things are bothering us out loud, so we'll text it out and then read off of that text because we find it hard to verbalise and sometimes we just take things harder than we should. We've agreed to go to marriage counselling and we're making an appointment together tomorrow, so there are good things afoot.\n\nFor more good news: He's agreed to go on vacation with me and my mother!\n\nAlso, I just want to say thank you to every single person who commented. It means a lot that people would wish us good luck and give advice and even say they were going to pray. Thank you for all of the advice! I'm trying to go down and thank everyone one-by-one but it might take a while, and in case I can't... thank you for helping save us.  \n\n**Uh, edit to the edit!** I would also like to add that I messed up in this, too. I liked to think that hearing maybe / other apathetic answers instead of just yes or no didn't bother me, but it did. And sometimes, as some people pointed out, I would get kind of passive aggressive about it. I'd ask him simply because it meant that I tried at times. I'm not proud of it, but it happened. I'm going to work on that more and myself as well. \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: I've started going places and doing things without my husband because he's a housecat kind of guy. I'm fine with it, but now he's upset with me because I'm going on vacation without him.",

            "This is one of those cases where I think you should tell him *everything* you just said here, you could even show him this post if you wanted.\n\nIf you decide to tell him all of this, sit him down and ask him to first just hear you out. Add in that you are worried about your relationship, and you want to fix things. He's unhappy about something, and you are unhappy because seeing him unhappy and worrying he is unhappy because you are doing something that may be contributing to his unhappiness in and of itself makes you unhappy. \n\nThe only way to fix this, is to talk about it. If he doesn't want to talk about the particular thing bothering him, it doesn't mean that you can't still talk about how it's affecting the relationship. ",
            "This reminds me of the time I say no to something because I don't want to step out of my comfort zone but later regret it completely. \n\nHe's grumbling to himself, he probably wants to go with you and half of him doesn't. I think you should ask one last time. Maybe he feels you gave up too easily? (You shouldn't have to obviously but some people deal with stuff immaturely) If you had coaxed him maybe he would've said yes and now his ego won't let him ask for more. Give him a way out. \n\nTell him you would love for him to go and you always imagined the holiday with him but you'll understand if he doesn't want to. This is a very no pressure way of asking. Get a very clear no and then move on with your conscience clear. If he wants something he needs to express it properly and reading his mind is not a skill you should have to learn. Enjoy your vacations and then see his attitude. If he's still in regret mode then ask for counseling. \n\nTell him you want clear and concise communication. If he wants something he should say it. If he's hesitating then you're right there to hold his hand. He only has to ask. ",
            "He probably feels ashamed that he's such an introvert/housecat, and wishes he was more adventurous and ambitious. \n\nWhile he may have always wanted to learn the language and go to that place, it seemed to him like far too much effort... A pipe dream, something that people dream about but never actually accomplish. \n\nThen you did it in four months, and all he has to show for how he spent the last four months is a few finished seasons on Netflix. \n\nEven if you're legitimately just doing it for yourself and not being passive aggressive towards him, and don't think less of him, he's responding from a place of shame and defensiveness. \n\nThat's his problem, I'm afraid. ",
            "> . \"You're the one that's going to know anything, there's really no point in me going.\"\n\nHey there, I'm an introverted (usually solo) traveller who often flies to countries where I don't speak the language at all.  Don't let that argument convince you!  It's absolutely not true.  On my first big trip I went to Chile with a friend who speaks Spanish and that was a lot of fun too!  My travel buddy didn't mind doing all the talking, and I didn't mind having someone there who speaks the language with me.  It's not a problem unless you make it one.",
            "I'm reading this as him not being happy that you're going, but realizing that this is his own problem and not yours and so not pushing the issue. He doesn't have to be happy about it, honestly. I would call him out on individual bad behavior, although it sounds like he apologizes for any slip ups.\n\nI do wonder, were you like \"I'm going to this place, would you like to come with me?\" or \"I want to plan a vacation to this place, and I'd really like you to go with me. Are you interested?\" A vacation to another country is a lot different to an outing or a day trip, and if it came across like you didn't really care whether he was there or not it could seem pretty hurtful. When he said, \"there's no point in me going,\" did you respond assuring him that he'd add something to the trip whether he knew the language or not?",
            "Someone else mentioned counseling and I think that's a solid route to take given the nature of how things are on both the sides of not really having an in between to resolve the situation (and it's really not this one trip but also any type of similar events/trips/movies, etc. from the past as well as those going forward) and the distinct breakdown of communication that is occurring as well. \n\nI also find it odd given the nature of things, you seem very lax in terms of how different the two of you are in terms of personalities/goals.\n\n\"I of course said that it was fine because that's not a flaw to me, it's just a character trait.\"\n\nSome traits that differ people are not compatible with. This particular introvert/extrovert difference is finally coming to a head in your relationship.\n\nYes early on it was small things, but essentially it sounds like you have your life, he has his, and when you go out and do things you document/report back to him. For some people this may work, for others it may not. \n\nOne thing to note:\n\n\" I even made it a point to have us do / go to things that he liked to do\"\n\nHow often has that been happening as of late? Do these outings still happen somewhat frequently? This may be a thing to discuss, i.e. going back to these joint/type of things if you have gotten away from that. \n\n",
            "Let him stew. He chose not to do these things with you, and he told you he doesn't want to go anyway. He's pulling you in two different directions. I would go on your vacation and let him deal with his problems on his own, but if you really want to make an effort, I suggest marriage counselling. ",

            "I would go on the trip anyway, but I wouldn't leave with that tension just hanging around in your wake. \n\nWhile I totally agree that he basically did this to himself, his feelings are only going to fester while you're gone. The problem is that he isn't owning up to them. Sometimes I feel frustration that I know is misplaced. The way to diffuse it is to acknowledge it. \n\nIt could be that he never expected you to learn a new language and maybe this new, adventurous side of you makes him nervous. Little outings around town and an international trip to become fluent in a language are different levels of adventure. He's an introvert and you're becoming more extroverted then maybe he thought you would, and while relationships like that can be fully functional, he may begin to feel it's an incompatibility.\n\nI don't know, just brainstorming. The only person who can tell you for sure is your husband. \n\nAt some point prior to your trip, I would sit him down and just ask for an honest discussion.  Remind him that you love him, and whether he joins you or not you're still going to love him. Offer to buy him a ticket one final time, because it would be amazing if he were there, but also be supportive that if he stays home he should buy a new video game/project/whatever hobby he enjoys so he can have a great time too. Tell him when you get home you want to swap stories, tell him you'll send him postcards while you're gone. You know. Make sure he knows he's still a part of everything, even through your metamorphosis into a more confident, outgoing person.",
            "The mechanics of your relationship have changed substantially, and for you, as far as I can tell these changes have been enormously positive, and you should be very proud. What you have done takes a lot of emotional labour and really is pretty damn impressive - but, when he met you, fell in love with you etc, you were not as strong and capable as you are now. Is it possible he is considering where he fits in now? Once he was your knight in shining armor, does he even know how to be your partner, and not the one who fixes you?\n\nIt is time for you to engage him about the underlaying issues with you becoming more extrovert than him because you have come out of your shell. There is nothing wrong with him being more introvert, but its not ok to hold you back or make you feel bad about the things you've found to fill up your life with joy. - If he is unaware of why he is behaving the way he is, maybe he needs to take time to think about it, before what he does turns into emotional blackmail, as in moping when you do something on your own initiative that he doesnt want to do, but then gets upset about being excluded from, eventhough he has rejected your efforts of including him. There could be a simple explanation, but the underlaying issue is he is acting out his emotional turmoil on you, and that is just lazy and not ok.\n\nMaybe you should both write down how you each imagine this issue could be fixed, in a way that keeps your relationship healthy and intact. - I cannot imagine he would write: Stop doing the things you enjoy because I dont want to do them. - Rather he will be forced to look at what it is he is actually asking you to do. - And if he still insists after looking hard at the truth of the matter, then you need to grab it by the throat and tell him what the consequences for your relationship would be.\n\n\nThe question is: Is he still right for you, now that you dont need fixing. Does he know how to be your bf, when you are nolonger seeking shelter in his arms all the time? And can you guys talk about this stuff?\n\n\nPs. if I was you, I would show him this thread and all the replies, and ask him to read it - and leave him for a bit so he could take it all in. Your opening post is very kind and loving towards him, - you shouldnt worry on that account.",

Common psychological problems associated with skin disease include feelings of stress, anxiety, anger, depression, shame, social isolation, low self-esteem and embarrassment. Skin conditions can also affect one\u2019s personal, professional and social life. Just because he acts like it's not a bother to him doesn't mean it's not affecting him greatly. He might just not like to talk about it. ",

            "You know well why he's upset:  You are on the road to leaving him.  You are changing, getting better. He isn't and he doesn't want to.  You are growing apart instead of growing together and he feels it.  So do you.",

I'm a bit like your husband in that I'm somewhat non-committal, but my wife knows that if she really wants to do something, she doesn't need my permission to do it without me.  We talked about it and she knows how to handle it. But she usually asks if I want to go first though as a courtesy. ",

            "Ok, so. My husband is a lot like yours in that he doesn't like to go places, not even (especially not) the movies. BUT he does go to dinner with me from time to time, and he has never been petulant about me going places. He's encouraged me to do so, in fact, with my mom, friends, on my own - he wants me to have experiences which enrich my life despite his preferring to stay home.\n\nYour husband is not being supportive of that and he needs to start if you guys are going to be able to have a good ongoing relationship. Because otherwise either he's going to resent you for dragging him out or you're going to resent him for pissing in your cheerios all the time. Right now, it feels like (I imagine) he pulled a bait and switch: 'Nope, not gonna learn that language but you have fun. We'll go to that place eventually.' 'What do you mean you want to go to this place which you've wanted to go to, I can't speak the language so I won't have fun!' '...What do you MEAN, you're going with your mother and without me!' Etc. That's shifting goalposts so that the only option you're left with is the one where you stay home with him. That's not okay.\n\nEven if he doesn't want to go and clearly communicated that from the first (which he didn't), it still isn't okay to guilt you or prevent you from going yourself. You have agency; he should not be getting in the way of that. Having a discussion about his feelings and expectations? Sure. But not this.",
            "I think he's depressed and doesn't want to tell you. He secretly wants to do these things with you, but depression keeps him sitting in the house. Now he feels resentful of you thriving, and is lashing out accordingly.\n\nI know many people are happy being home bodies, but that's my take on it. I could easily be wrong.",
            "It seems clear he's used to you catering to him. You do you and he doesn't do anything but does listen; then you set up things for both of you and you two always do what he wants.\n\nThis is the first big thing where you are doing what you want. And you're even doing it now with someone else. You get a turn for you!\n\nHe needs therapy at this point, even if he doesn't understand why he's acting the way he is. He's now going to not listen to you and not go on your trip--and it's a good guess that he will act badly about it afterwards too? Just no. ",
            "my guess is that even though you've made a point to tell him you're only staying inside because you're depressed, you staying inside was significant to his own complacency with his homebody status. It's much easier to ignore our own behavior or not look at it closely if someone is right there beside us acting the same way. You've now upended that and he's judging himself and his behavior from a more societal perspective and he can't deal. \n\nit sounds like he knowsthat him giving you a hard time about this is wrong and you sound uber respectful so the sole issue is pretty much that he isn't talking to you about the issue or hasn't wrapped his head around it yet. \n\nI get the balance between pushy and wanting him to join but I think you should be a bit more pushy. Being a homebody is fine. Not going out into the world cuz anxiety and fear is not. He is clearly scared and anxious about this trip and so I think it's probably important that you don't just let him off the hook here without dealing with his underlying issues. \n\n\"Husband, it's clear to me that you're having some difficulty making your peace with my going on this vacation. I love you and have so much respect for who you are and I never want to push you into doing things you aren't comfortable. I know you prefer to stay home and I hope you know that I love our life together, and I wouldn't change anything about it. That said I think you understand that I enjoy going out and socializing more than you and need the freedom to go on this trip without feeling guilty that I'm abandoning you. \n\nThroughout the past 2 years I thought that we were planning this trip together and I was so excited about it. I still really want to have this experience with you and since it seems like at some point you wanted to go, I'm wondering what's changed. If you're anxious about traveling with me I'd like us to be able to talk about your preferences for the trip so that we can try to make it happen! i don't want to push you into doing Somethig you're so against, so if you really don't want to go then that's fine.  but it's clear that you're bothered by something and we need to talk about that and deal with that regardless\"",

I remember when my ex and I bought our house, she was very excited and was always talking about how she wanted to do X to the garden, and paint the siding, and do Y to the basement. My mind was simply trying to get the basics covered. I wanted to get the roof replaced, I wanted to get the rooms re-sheetrocked, and I wanted to be able to live there safely. I would always be a buzzkill to her ideas because my answer always had to be \"later\" or \"after this is done\".\n\nI know that analogy doesn't *exactly* relate, but is there something more immediate going on that could be bugging him that is taking his focus away from you/your happiness? Perhaps children? Living conditions? Health problems? Family issues? Does he just need to be coaxed to talk about things? I know I need to be in the right mood to talk about something, and if someone chooses their words incorrectly I will clam right up and not want to talk. \n\nJust some food for thought. I don't really think you're at fault here, but at the same time I know if I were in your position I would try to find every angle that *I* could help from. You can't change his preferences/personality, but perhaps you can help him figure himself out.\n\nGood luck! :)",
            "You need to talk to him. It sounds like your personal/knowledge growth is making him feel left out or insecure, but you should be able to let him know that you aren't growing beyond him. I would do what you can to encourage him to go with you on the trip, too. Ask him whether he'd like a crash course from you on the language, ask him what's holding him back here.\n\nIf need be, ask him to go to counseling. I would also frame this issue *entirely* around the language and trip, because you haven't mentioned anything else he's having problems with.",
            "Does he work outside of the home?",
            "Kudos to making things happen with actions, I love hitting goals whether it's fitness, emotional, mental or educational health. You might suggest a few couples counseling sessions with him and word it in a way that you have some things you'd like to discuss with him as well as whatever he'd like to discuss. That way it's not just a 'what's wrong with you' sort of thing, I hope things perk up it sounds like you guys have an enviable relationship otherwise.",
            "It's highlighting to him how introverted he is and that maybe he's missed out with not learning this language.\n\nHe also might feel that he's not adventurous enough for you and you going on this trip is because you don't get enough out of him which won't be making him feel too supportive.\n\nIt's his own issue but he also won't feel like talking to you about it. At the end of the day one of you has to force the other to sit down and communicate properly about it or you're just going to end up resenting each other.",
            "OP, what country are you going to? Depending on the country, there might be a large number of English speakers, making his concerns irrelevant. ",
            "Sometimes a \"we need to talk about this\" is in order. This is putting strain on your relationship, and avoiding the issue won't fix that. If it's a serious enough problem that he gets mad about you trying to address it, then that's even more reason to talk about it. Trying to avoid an unneccesary argument is paramount. He obviously sees something is wrong, and he needs to talk about it like an adult who wants their marriage to succeed. ",

I just need to know where the problem is coming from so that I can take the appropriate measures to help alleviate it. We're married.

            "Just checking for clarification- when you go to the movies by yourself, or booked the tickets, was there a step where you actually said \"Hey, I'm gonna head to that movie now- do you want to come with me?\"  or \"Hey, I'm booking those next week.  If you don't want to come, my mom will join me.  Are you coming?\"\n\nAlso, definitely take the advice of others and get marriage counseling.  A lack of communication kills relationships, and right now it seems like your husband actively doesn't want to communicate what's wrong to you.  Regardless of whether he tells you what it is or not, it's actively hurting your marriage. ",
            "I'm really pleased with your update! I was going to suggest that maybe he was slightly depressed because that's kind of how I act with my SO when I'm in a depressive funk. I'm glad he wants to get help and I'm sure you two can work it out. Have fun on your trip! ",
            "This reminds me of the children's book \"The Big O\". ",
            "My SO and I are very independent. If we want to do something without the other we just give them a heads up, and if we want the other to join us we explicitly invite them. We even have separate bank accounts even though we live together and will soon be married. \n\nStill, there are those times when one of us is really passionate about something, like a concert or whatever, and we will try to convince the other to go. Sometimes it works and they have a better time than they thought. However many times when that happens, it doesn't end well. \n\nWhen one of us does something because they feel obligated or coerced, they might passive-aggressively sabotage it by complaining a lot or just dampen the experience for the other. \n\nTLDR - if you want to do this thing your husband doesn't want to do, do it on your own. Better yet, befriend someone from class and arrange a trip with them to use your new language skills. Maybe one of your other friends would go. ",

            "A few things from my perspective. While it's perfectly okay to do things without your SO (my wife and I have separate hobbies as well), I'm not entirely sure I'd be okay with my wife just going on a vacation without me. Vacations come with cost (flight, hotel, food, cab, etc.) that exceeds our individual budget allowance, and so these kinds of things would need to be both agreed on (for us) before making the purchase.\n\nWhat I read was that you asked if he wanted to go, responded that he didn't, and then you proceeded to plan and buy the things for the trip. Did you tell your husband that you were going to do it before you bought everything? Did you discuss you going without him? Was there an agreement made over the money it takes to go on this vacation? You said that things were great with your \"little adventures\", but taking a flight and going somewhere for a vacation goes beyond a \"little adventure\" (as you put it). I think there was a miscommunication here, and that he feels you stepped over a line that you didn't know was there. I know you said you've tried talking about it, but it hasn't gone well. I'm here to tell you that communication will likely fix this issue, and the two of you need to be able to get the communication going. That means therapy, a calm discussion about feelings, or a \"come to Jesus\" type of talk. It all depends on what communication works for you guys, but it needs to be worked out.",

If he still says no... then honestly i think there's something really wrong with him.

I knew the way I treated her was horrible. I made a promise to myself that from then on, I would be sure to treat people the way they deserve. You shouldn't take people for granted, especially when they're nothing but good to you. Nobody deserves the way I treated her the first time around. I learned a lot in the time I took alone. Why I treated her the way I did and I looked carefully into the excuses I made. I did end up sleeping around, yeah. I did a lot of things I wanted to do(not with women, in life), and some things I'm ashamed of. I learned who I want to be, who I am, and how to get to that point. I'm still improving. But I still regretted the way I treated her for a long time. A really, really, really long time. And I still do.\n\n6 months after I posted, I ran into her jogging in the park. It was the first time I saw her since the concert. We spoke for a long time. Not about us - just about life and how we've been. Her and the new boyfriend had broken up, but I didn't expect that meant we would become anything. To my surprise, we began talking and hanging out again. I thought I'd never see her again. She was very wary on hanging out with me and I understood why. We'd meet up and walk in the park for a few hours, every week or so for almost a year. \n\nOne day she came over my house again, and well. We began going out on actual dates and I learned how to communicate. I don't hold things in anymore. We both hang out with each others friends now, and I guess there's so many things I never noticed about her. She's very sweet, beautiful, funny, and highly intelligent. I really hit the jackpot both times but this time I know I won't mess it up. So far it's been almost a year since she came over again, and things are well. I'm going to keep working on myself to be the best person I could be. Thanks for knocking some sense into me /r/relationships.\n\n**tl;dr**: I broke up with my girlfriend a little bit over 2 years ago and was a selfish asshole. We reconciled almost year and a half ago and I grew up a lot.",

I care about you and us but obviously you don't feel the same way, and I won't try to convince someone that me and our relationship is worth the effort.\"\n\nWell THEN he realized what he lost.

I have been taking care of them for most of my life.\n\nWhen I was 20, our parents died in an accident and I had to step up to take care of Mark and Lena. We didn't have any close relative, except for our grandma, who was too sick to take care care of us.\n\nI retired from university and got a job. Somehow we managed to survive, thanks to my work, our parents' inheritance and our grandma, who sent us money sometime.\n\nWhile they were growing up, there were many times I believed we couldn't keep living like that but I always tried to not show I was worried in front of them and to act as if everything was fine.\n\nWhen Lena was 17, she decided she wanted to be a doctor like our father. I don't know how we managed to pay for her university ( it was a joint effort of me, Lena, Mark and grandma)  but she was able to graduate. Grandma had been stuck in bed since I was 18 but she did the impossible to come to Lena's graduation ceremony. She basically came on a wheelchair with her doctor on one side and me on the other.\n\nMark loves flower since he was little and always said he wanted to work in a flower shop. That's exactly what he is doing now. It's not thrilling but it's a good job where he is able to do what he likes, so I'm happy for him.\n\nLena got married 2 years ago with Tom. He is a bit too innocent but all in all he is a good man.\n\nI work for a moving company. The salary is not the best but now that Lena and Mark are independent, it's enough to live my life and I'm slowly paying back my debts. I can't afford many luxuries but I don't care about that. I'm not a fancy person; as long as I'm healthy and I have a roof over my head and a book in my hands, I'm happy.\n\nUnfortunately my siblings don't agree with my way of thinking. They feel guilty because I couldn't go to college and couldn't get a better job and they blame themselves for this. I have told them a thousand of times that I don't care about that anymore and that I'm just happy they could achieve their dreams and live a comfortable life.\n\nIn the past 2 years I was able to convince them to let it go.\n\nRecently, though, I had a minor accident. Nothing serious, a desk fell on my hand and I broke two fingers. The doctor said they will heal in a couple of months.\n\nUnfortunately, this made Lena and Mark worry again about me.\n\nLena wants me to go live with her and her husband and Mark wants me to work in his flower shop.\n\nI don't want to be a burden to them, I don't want to interfere in my sister's wedding and I don't want my brother to give me a job out of pity.\n\nHow can I convince them I'm fine with my life and just want them to be happy and move on with their lives?\n\nTL;DR : I took care of my siblings since they were little. Now they insist on \"making things even\" by taking care of me. I don't want that.\n\nShort EDIT: I want to thank you all for the comments. I have read all the comments so far and you have given me a lot to think about. Thank you.",

            "I\u2019m going to be blunt: you are letting your pride hurt your relationships with your siblings. Look how you describe your relationship with your siblings. I don\u2019t want to be a burden. I don\u2019t want their pity. I don\u2019t want to interfere. \n\nI\u2019m going to translate that for you: you\u2019re scared to need anything from anyone because of your trauma of losing your parents. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you have to move in with your sister or take a job you don\u2019t want. But it does mean that it\u2019s not normal or healthy to do life without relying on the support of others. Your siblings want to help you, and the best way to get them to stop would be to give them suggestions of real help that will get you where you want to go for the next part of your life. Maybe that\u2019s helping you pay off some of your debt into an interest free loan from them so you can focus on retraining for a new job. Maybe it\u2019s helping you network to learn more about possible careers or find investors in a business of your own. I don\u2019t know, but you have three successful people who want to help you succeed.\n\nLast, I suggest you read the essay the Sandwich Means I Love You by Captain Awkward. When you refuse the help of others, you are subconsciously telling them \u201cI don\u2019t want to give you opportunities to love me.\u201d Which I\u2019m sure is not what you want to say.",
            "OP, I\u2019m going to take a different direction here;\nI\u2019m in love with a man who, like you, struggles to receive and accept love for what it is, struggles to believe he is not a burden and that I do things for him because I truly want to. Doing things for him literally lights my heart up. I love to love him.\n\nIt is so difficult and so so so painful to repeatedly be told that he likes (whatever the gesture was), but to please not waste my time on him, that he knows I am busy, tired, etc. I know him well enough by now (and yes, we have discussed it) to know that this pushback isn\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t want to be loved, it is because he fears it, feels unworthy of it, fears he is a burden.\n(Yes, he is in therapy.)\n\nOP, on behalf of anyone in your life who loves you, I want you to know that some of our greatest joys in life is giving love and knowing it has been received. You are not a burden, nor a pity party. You are worthy of being loved and it lights up my fucking life to love that man and I am sure your siblings would be just as overjoyed to be able to give to you.",
            "Your brother isn\u2019t offering you a job out of pity. He wants to help you like you\u2019ve helped him, because he loves you\u2014and same with your sister. They don\u2019t see you as a burden! They want to help take care of you the way you\u2019ve taken care of them.\n\nIf you truly don\u2019t need it, tell them so. But if your normal job is performing hard manual labor, you\u2019ve recently injured yourself so you can\u2019t work for a while, AND you\u2019re nearing 40\u2026don\u2019t you think you might need some help here? Maybe finding a job that will put less strain on your body? Or helping you with bills while your fingers heal? \n\nConsider letting them help you.",
            "At some point, you have to trust your siblings are adults and are capable of offering you gifts or support with sincerity, and not just out of childhood guilt.\n\nYou're infantilizing them when you refuse to even consider thier suggestions or gifts.\n\nThey are adults. They can choose what they can afford to offer someone they care for, and how they want to live their own adult lives. That includes offers they make to you, and suggestions about how you can be a part of their lives.\n\nLearn to accept some support graciously from people who care for you. Doesn't mean you have to accept every thing, or do things you don't want to do, but seriously, get the stick outta your ass, and give them the gift of trust and respect as fellow adults. Trust them to be sincere and thoughtful in what they are offering. Respect them enough to say Thank You, or No Thank You, instead of continuously re-enacting your roles from childhood with them and tell them you don't trust them to be acting out of anything but guilt. They are sensible and capable young adults. You get a lot of credit for them being that way. Learn to treat them as such.",
            "> I don't want to be a burden to them....I don't want my brother to give me a job out of pity.\n\nIs that why you gave up so much to raise your brother and sister?  Pity?  Was that how you felt about them?  That they were a burden?  Why are you the only one allowed to make sacrifices for your family members?\n\nYou literally gave up your future to ensure theirs.  It may not have felt like you had a choice, but you really did.  You could have looked after yourself, finished school, and built a comfortable life by now.  Your siblings would have survived.  \n\n> I have told them a thousand of times that I don't care about that anymore and that I'm just happy they could achieve their dreams and live a comfortable life.\n\nYou may have made peace with your decision but you are deluding yourself if you think your brother and sister do not know exactly how much you put yourself behind so they could get a good start in life.  They are adults and have been so for long enough enough to truly understand and appreciate what you did for them, **and they will never be able to forget it.**  At this point you are doing them a disservice by not allowing them to balance the scales, if only a little bit.\n\nIt is time you learn to allow yourself to receive help, not just give it.",
            "I think people enjoy doing nice things for people they love. I think sometimes we feel like we are being selfish by allowing others to help us. Sometimes oddly enough it can be a little selfish not to let loved ones help. Sounds like a really nice family you have and I admire how you\u2019ve all gotten through something as difficult as this.",
            "I think you have forgotten that love is a two way street. If you just give and never receive then they will always feel as 8f they should have done more. \n\nPractice receiving outside of your comfort zone. If you are not working for a few weeks go visit Lena and Tom and practice not feeling like a burden. Just go \"be\". \n\nGo visit Mark and see what the flower shop work is all about and seriously consider it as a back up job possibility.  Moving company is hard on the body and it could be a healthy option. \n\nYou don't have to accept their bigger offers just try on the possibility. Do you have time off to try this?",
            ">as long as I'm healthy\n\nYeah your job is not going to keep you healthy. You helped your siblings, why would you turn your nose up at them returning the favor? You're only 36, dude, and the work you're doing now will wipe you out faster than usual retirement age.",
            "Here\u2019s the thing.  You were given an incredibly difficult job at a particularly young age. You had to give up your vision of your future to do this job. You\u2019ve done your job.  You did it so well both your siblings are thriving, happy, financially secure members of society. Great!  Now it\u2019s your turn. What do you ultimately want?  Right now you have a physically demanding job that I\u2019m not certain is sustainable for the long run. Now you get to decide where you want to be in 20 years. Do you want to go back to school?  Learn a trade?  The world is your oyster.  You incurred debt because of your siblings.  You feel they don\u2019t owe you anything.  If the roles were reversed wouldn\u2019t you feel the need to return something?  The people that you raised are good people that love you and want to return some of the goodness you gave them.  That\u2019s a sign of just how much you did right.",
            "Listen to them. Moving heavy stuff at 36, till when? \nYou need another, easier on your body job. Maybe look into going back to college? Get a desk job. You graciously took care of your siblings without it being your responsibility, now allow them the opportunity to feel a little better by taking a little care of their older brother.",
            "Dude, listen to me. Your siblings are not treating you like a burden. They want to repay you for your efforts. There is nothing wrong with accepting help. \n\nRight now, you are letting your pride hurt the relationship between you and your siblings. Stop that. Yes, what you did was amazing. But let others take care of you for once.",
            "INFO: Do your broken fingers mean you can't continue at the movers or live on your own? I would assume you can continue, but your siblings offering you a job/rent free accommodation is making me think twice. Also, was the injury at work, and if so, was it determined who (if anyone) was at fault for purposes of compensation? That might be something to look at if you can't work from it.\n\nEither way, my point would be *Don't let \"I can survive\" be the reason you refuse support when the support is to try to help you thrive*. I understand not wanting to live with a couple, especially when they're relatives and noticeably younger than you - getting used to someone else's routines etc can be annoying. But if you're out of work, why not take the offer of a part time/temporary position at your brother's shop? I wouldn't say the offer is out of \"pity\", I see it as an offer from someone who has the budget and gap in workforce, who also happens to care about you and think you wouldn't immediately cock it up.\n\nI understand it can be stifling, but it sounds like they just want to help because they're good people. Often, accepting help from someone can make everyone happier - if you're sure you don't need the job or the bedroom, is there some physical task you could ask them to help with? \"No, I'm fine for money, but actually I was wanting to <trim the hedge/clean & fix up the decking/etc> and my fingers would make it awkward to do alone, could you come over next weekend and we'll make a day of it?\" They'd get to have helped, you get to prove that you're still capable, and you get to spend a day hanging out with your nice siblings.",

You don't have to go for anything fancy or ambitious. Just a modest job so you can take care of yourself, and you won't risk slipping a disc in your spine and hurting for the rest of your life.\n\nI say accept your sibling's help. Let them do for you what you did for them.",

It sounds like they really want and need to give back. You helped raise these beautiful people.",
            "One thing that you could try would be to say something like this:\n\n\"Mark and Lena, when you offer me things like jobs in your business [or whatever; pick things that stand out to you as good examples of the behavior you are vexed about], I feel as if you think you have an obligation to me because of how we grew up.  I chose the life path that I am on, and am happy with it, and I need to feel as if you respect my choices.  For that to happen, I need you to stop trying to give me things and opportunities that you believe will make my life what you think it should be, instead of the life I want it to be.  Can you do that for me?\"\n\nEither they will catch the clue-by-four as you present it to them, or they will not.  \n\nIf they do not, then what you have to come to terms with is that they are *never* going to stop trying, and so at that point your choices are to just learn to live with their attempts, and politely decline them whenever they make them, or to distance yourself from them so that they don't have so many opportunities to try.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, you cannot change them.  If they do not choose to change this behavior, there's nothing you can do but accept that this is who they have chosen to be, and deal with it either through tolerance or distance.",

            "Maybe you could ask them to help you out with college still. Moving company is a job you can do indeed, as long as you're healthy. But that latter part is no guarantee. You now are in a place where you could look at a back up career.

            "First of all, I commend you for stepping up when you needed too in a time that I can't even begin to imagine how hard it was for you at such a young age. Second, as an oldest sibling, I get where you're coming from. I personally would have a hard time taking offers from my sisters too, but I don't think it's pity. It's love. You helped them get to where they are today. You got them through losing your parents at a time that they needed them most. You loved them so much that they always came first, just like your parents would have. Now it's their turn to \"repay\" you. And they want to. I don't think it's your pride getting in the way, I think you just don't want to \"disrupt\" their lives. You won't be, you'll be giving them the gift of being there for you, the way you were for them. And honestly even parents move in with their kids as they get older. Don't look at it as pity, look at it as love",

They want to help you because they love you, and because  you thought them that working together they could lift each other up, that they could fulfill their dreams, even under very difficult circumstances.  \n\nIt would be a good idea to honour those lessons, and respect the people you raised. You can guide their help, but if you refuse it that will diminish the lessons of strength of character you instilled in them. \n\nUltimately, you are their sibling. Do you think your parents would not have wanted the best for you? Do you think they would have wanted any one of their kids to refuse help from family? What if you wanted to help your parents and they refused? How would you feel?\n\nYou would be honouring your parents if you accepted the help and support of your siblings.",
            "Hi 36M. You should let your siblings help you in any way they can. They want to. They love you, you know.\n\nYou may feel like their father, but you're not. You are their older brother whom they admire infinetly - and they know what you did for them. They KNOW. And want to give back. You should let them, or they'll feel guilt for the rest of their lives.\n\nWe, the people a little older, may understand where you're coming from, but that doesn't mean it's right. You don't have to work at your brothers flower shop, you don't have to move in with your sister, if you really don't want to. But you need to figure out a way for them to help you. I'm sayin YOU need to because you're the one saying no to everything they offer and they don't know what else to do.\n\nThink of a way they can help, because that's all they want. I would, too, want to help. You seem amazing, and are not unworthy of help when you're in trouble. I promise.",
            "You took care of them because you love them. Why is it hard for you to accept that that's what they want to do for you, because they love you? They're not going to get hurt or disadvantaged by helping you now that they're grown. You enabled them to get to where they are now and they want you to succeed as they have.\n\nThey are not \"sacrificing\" anything for you, if that's what you're worried about. They're not paying you back in some way at the expense of their livelihoods or education.  \n\nYou've been too long in survival mode. But maybe if you just accept some help, you could be thriving.",

            "I'm going to offer a suggestion that you're not going to agree with, but that you definitely need. I think it strikes a balance between it maybe not feeling like \"pity stuff\" (like having you move in with them), while also not being something merely symbolic, but actually something that a) you really need, b) would probably not be able to do for yourself, and c) will better your life in the long run.\n\nAsk them to bankroll you for a couple of (or five) years of psychodynamic psychotherapy with an experienced therapist (that's likely not the kind you'll be able to access through your insurance). You need this in the short term and idrectly because of your unprocessed trauma of losing your parents, which is definitely shaping the way you relate to the world (and definitely your siblings), and you need it in the long-term because you seem unable to see what they're seeing... which is that, while you're young today, continuing in a manual labour job is just not sustainable, and will land you in a world of trouble if for nothing else because you won't be able to support yourself when you're older and hoping to retire. I'm going to shortcut around your therapy and suspect that this short-sigthedness is a result of your having needed to spring into action when your parents died in order to support your siblings (Which was absolutely the thing to do at the time); but is a life-mode that is no longer applicable nor sustainable for you.\n\nI don't know what the future holds for you, but I know that carrying on like you are you're not going to end up a happy man. I think your siblings will be thrilled and jump at the opportunity to help you in such a tangible and veritable way, and I think this might just be \"not handout-y\" enough in order for it not to be painful for you to receive.",

Do you want a different career? You and your siblings have survived. They\u2019ve thrived. You\u2019re allowed to dream now. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to go beyond survival and just being satisfied with life. It\u2019s probably been a while since you\u2019ve reconnected with that possibility, so maybe think about what you wanted to do when you were twenty and go from there. \n\nNow what is something your siblings could do that would allow you to pursue those dreams?",

So why can't you accept their help?\n\nI'm not saying you should live with your sister or work in your brother's shop, but they are extending help, and you should seriously consider it. It's not about pity or guilt. It's about showing you how much they love and appreciate you. They see you struggling and can offer ways to make things easier for you. That is what family does.\n\nYou stepped up for them, now it's their turn to do the same for you. And it's out of nothing but love.",

I took care of my younger brother and sister growing up and after, until a year and a half ago my sister caught covid and passed away. A horrible sitiluation because she was like my daughter and if you ask them they would say I raised them. I went no contact with them because some narcissistic kids lied to them. I miss my younger brother and his kids he's like my mom and is either at work or drunk off his ass, our older brother is in jail and ive only talked to him once in 6 years but lived with his ex and his kids to help her becuase she has brain cancer and i showed all 3 of them a better life. OP I am glad that your scenario after you guys grew up is better than mine. This is an amazing outcome and be glad they want to take care of you. I mean all this in the nicest way possible, please just love them the way they are and except that they just want to show you their gratitude.

You don't offer a job onto someone who is a burden because they wouldn't do the job but you can.\n\nWhy do you want them to move on with their lives so badly by essentially leaving you behind?\n\nYou literally taught them that's not what family does. You stepped up and finished raising them even at the cost of something big because you loved them. That's what they're trying to do with you.

            "I think everyone has said the blunt part of it, but to add, it's okay to not want their help. You aren't required to accept it. And it's incredibly hard for most people to learn to take a compliment, let alone huge favors like that. \n\nThe best way to think about this is to compare what they think you deserve vs what you want and/or think you deserve. If you communicate complete contentment with a life they believe is far below what you deserve, they will believe that you're trying to stay strong for them. After all, you did it for so long and they certainly figured that out at some point. So your best bet is to note something you are willing to accept from them. In one comment you mention you'd like to go out to dinner with them. Definitely let them know that! They're not used to doing things for you so you have to help guide them towards the things that would actually make you feel loved. \n\nIn addition, keep thinking about your future. You sound so sweet and lovely, so I hope you find a great partner if you want one or just enjoy every book you get! But everyone needs help at some point, so I hope you can get to a comfortable enough place that you can list your siblings as emergency contacts.",

Honestly, she'll take care of her normal house bills, but let's say if something big and unexpected pops up,  like the AC broke down, then we help pay that.  Or in the case of her car , after sometime of using her really old car,  we got her another used car but it was just more modern.\n\nAnd if we go on any kind of family vacation , usually we take care of her bills like lodging and food and transportation.\n\nIt works out to show that we appreciate her and while we all still struggle to really make it,  but at least we have a good relationship with each other, so that even if sometimes we can't financially do all that we want to do but we can enjoy little things like hanging out together and having lunch or dinner.\n\nYou may not feel an urgent need of their financial care but every now and then if they offer things like this, accept it  graciously .  they want to do it for you.",

Even if the accident had never happened to your parents. You were injured at work and your siblings are worried that if you continue that work you will get injured again, and they want you to heal quickly and then find a safer job. Because they love you. It isn't because of your past, or payback, or pity. They just love you. \n\nI think you should suck it up and move in with your sister. It can be temporary while your hand heals.

            "I think youre the kind of sibling that dreams are made of, my friend. If you truly do not need/want their offered aid, then that is fair. However, if it is something you\u2019re refusing to do because the thought of being taken care of cripples your sense of agency\u2026 then maybe allow that to fall away and count it a blessing you\u2019ve got family to lean in on in vulnerable, humbling times. \n\nAs the eldest sibling with a younger brother I love as I do my own soul, I too have nothing but deepened peace with every modicum of \u201csuccess\u201d that comes his way\u2026 especially if it is something I long for. He does not ever feel bad about this though LOL and neither do I. If he were to obtain resources in surplus that I lack, I too would give some degree of pushback as its just not a matter of \u201cEven Stevens\u201d to me. Then again, if the man insisted, I\u2019d be rude to turn down a loved ones gifts and blessings. Anyways, it can be hard to discern within ourselves whether or not we have fully allowed ourselves to receive life\u2019s various blessings, whenever we are accustomed to tending to ourselves and others dependent on us to be a blessing in their daily lives - as you did with your siblings at just 20 years old.\n\nYou have a real gift here and some karmic brownie points in the realm of compassion, integrity and responsibility - let those who know this about you more than a stranger on Reddit, reward you accordingly.",
            "I once read that you can be independant also accept others love and help, It doesnt make you less independent or less power \ud83d\ude0a",
            "You are a fucking hero. Period. Thank you for being you and taking care of your siblings and sending them off into the world as decent human beings.",
            "I admire what you have done for your siblings, you're a truly great man, that being said, you're letting your pride harm your relationship with the two closest family members you'll have for the rest of your life.\n\nI understand that you don't want their \"pity\", but try to put yourself in their shoes and understand that they feel guilt, whether this feeling os justifiable or not is not something you can determine on your own. \n\nThey can treat you, without you being a \"burden\" to them. Were they a \"burden\" to you? I'm sure you wouldn't call them that, so why call yourself that? \n\nPick your battles, I wouldn't go live with my brother and his family over two broken fingers or accept a job from my other brother, but you can think of someway to make them feel useful to you or they can. You need communication in this situation, don't let your pride hurt your relationship.",
            "You seem like a rare man. I seriously respect it. I think it would be super cool for you to accept that your siblings care so much about you. I mean dang. You deserve that man. You just gotta figure out how to help them love on you better. In my family nobody talks about their feelings, and so I get if it can be a bit awkward to show that when you're so use to being the leader, but I think it would be good for you and your siblings to talk about some different ways to show appreciation. For some people, simply accepting compliments can be so damn difficult, but we owe it to our loved ones to let them feel needed sometimes. Anyway, good job man. You ought be proud.",
            "Take what they're offering. Go back to school and get a job that isn't manual labour. How many more years could you be a mover, anyway? You raised your siblings well and their care of you is a testament to you as a person."

Here's the OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4v35ti/my_best_friend_25f_has_been_ignoring_me_for_a/\n\n\n\nI called Sarah's home phone the morning after I got her message. Her mom answered and told me she was out with Joe. We chatted for a few minutes, and.then she suddenly started crying. She told me she feels like she's lost her daughter. She said she would ask Sarah to call me. I didn't get a call back. \n\n\nThe next day I got a surprise visit from Lily, who Sarah and I were really good friends with in college. Lily and I had fallen out of touch and I was really excited to see her again. That night I took her to a party. An actor that Sarah always liked was there, and Lily ended up hitting it off with him and posting a picture of the three of us doing shots on Facebook. \n\n\nThat night I got a text from Sarah saying, \"Since when do you hang out with (actor)?\" I was extremely annoyed and didn't respond. An hour later she texted \"I guess you're too much of a celebrity to respond.\"\n\n\nI spent about an hour ranting to poor Lily, and then composed an email to Sarah. I think I kept it pretty unemotional. Basically, I told her that she had really hurt me by cutting me out of her life, and I didn't think it was fair for her to suddenly reappear with no explanation or apology. I also said that I think her relationship with Joe is toxic and that I hope she overcomes her fear of being alone so that she can stop jumping into unhealthy relationships. Finally I told her that both her mother and I are worried about her, but I don't have the time or emotional energy to keep trying anymore. If she wants to get in touch when she's fixed her personal issues, I'll be open to listening. Until then, we're not friends anymore. \n\n\n\nI'm upset, I'm tired, but mostly I'm done. I hope I made the right decision. \n\n\n\n---   \n**tl;dr**: Best friend is no longer my friend. ",

Boy was I wrong about her.\n\nIf this is how she tries to get back into your life (and no, I don't think we can chalk this one up to Joe), she's truly no longer your friend. Unbelievably rude.\n\nI'm deeply sorry for her mother, it must be extremely painful to see your daughter lose herself so thoroughly. But I think you're justified in being done. That is about as disappointing an update as I could have imagined. I'm sorry, OP.",

            "You made the right decision.\n\nI live in LA, too. It's funny how people reappear when they think you know someone they want to or have connections they need, and it's especially hard when you aren't from here and it's someone from a \"normal\" place. In my experience, a lot of people are not going to be happy for you unless you are doing things for them...and those aren't the people you should do things for. It's great that you didn't try to get him a job and stood up for yourself to her. You haven't gone Hollywood, your friend has gone Joetown. When you're in an unhealthy relationship, and your friend's pattern of unhealthy relationships is notable, you either leave or you subscribe to the other person's worldview. She's subscribed to his worldview, you realized it, and you are better off being away from her as long as she's this person. ",
            "Sounds like you did the reasonable thing. I'm sure she won't respond or reach out until she breaks up with her bf, if she ever does. She doesn't sound like a pleasant person though, in that last message she was baiting you just to get a response. Nice people don't do that. ",
            "Man. This is painful but it seems you made the right decision. Some people grow up, and some people don't - even if the two of you were best friends. Sometimes lives diverge. \n\nCongratulations to you on your success. Keep rockin' it. And don't be surprised if Sarah tries to come into your life again. At that time you'll have the power to decide if she gets let in again or not. ",
            "You did make the right decision, and I'm glad that in the email you mentioned her relationship with Joe. Right now she might be close minded and just brush off what you said in the email, but in the long run hopefully she sees that you and her mother are right. Good job OP!",
            "Jeez. You made the right decision, but I'm sorry that it ended up this way. Good for you for being clear and emphatic in your message to her - maybe she'll think on your words at some future point with Joe, and they will give her the push she needs to look at the relationship and her own behaviour in it with fresh eyes. And if not, at least you know you were honest, and you tried. Her poor, poor mother :-(",

He even agreed with me that day. Well, a couple of weeks later she's prego and he gets back together with her. I haven't seen him in over 6 months. Been friends for about 12 years. Oh well, sometimes the truth hurts. I lost a friend but one day hopefully he realizes that she's a succubus. ",

Reaching out the way you did was perfect- you made it clear you weren't going to put up with her bullsit and still left the door open. Knowing i had people I could turn to even though I didnt deserve it was what eventually saved me. I was in a bad place for a long time and I know how much I hurt the people closest to me. It took me a lot of years before I got help and another 2 years of therapy but even after all that time those open doors let me go home. You need to move on with your life and it sounds like you are doing that. Dont ever let yourself feel guitly for not helping her, you did everything you could. ",

            "She seems like the kind of person that would only want to talk to you if she needs something. I have a friend who only texts me or appoligizes to me when she needs me. Otherwise, I'm not important enough otherwise. That's good your no longer friends with her!",
            "Going through something similar with a best friend as well. This was inspiring. You see it from a different perspective when it's not you.\n\nYou're not wrong.

            "> *both her mother* and I are worried about her\n\nIn the future, **please do not do this again**. Her mother broke down *to you* because she can't break down to Sarah without risking her cutting contact. This was in confidence. Not something you should have aired to Sarah. You cut contact with her, but you threw her mother under a bus and now Sarah might cut contact with mom because she feels mom 'sided' with you. You just gave Joe ammunition against Sarah's mom and might have isolated her even more.\n\nYou didn't successfully keep this unemotional. You cutting contact is not a problem. It's a healthy decision if you can't handle trying to be Sarah's lifeline when/if she decides to grab it and get out. Burning other possible escape ropes for people who can handle this emotional turmoil to help Sarah is a problem though.\n\nIf Sarah asks about her mom's feelings, *lie*. You made it up. You lied because you felt hurt and wanted to hurt her too or something. Whatever. Just don't spill more beans about how her mom is worried about her, because that's not going to help. It's going to burn the rest of the bridge. I understand why you did it because you're hoping it makes her realize things are seriously wrong, but it was a big mistake in my opinion. That wasn't yours to tell her.",

Great job writing that letter and clearly stating your perspective on the matter, and telling her what she needs to work on to earn your friendship back.

The part after was not necessary was it?  Seemed like the part that followed was downhill.    If for whatever reason Sarah ever see's the light,  you have made it harder for her to crawl out of her hole.    But on the other hand,  maybe the kick you gave her is what she needed.   These situations are so draining,  but if we can't give them the energy they deserve,  we really are too lazy to care.   Caring hurts.   That's life.   We try to defend ourselves from that hurt.   But it causes more hurt.",

But I would only do so if they accept an offer to help them land employment and they manage to do so and keep a job for a period of time. \n\nFrom what you have said, the odds of them actually appreciating and accepting that kind of help are likely slim to none.

I do think that if your sister ever shows positive change that you should consider maybe connecting with her again. If you tell her no, just say you've been burned before and it's a you issue not about her. \n\nThe only reason I'm saying this is because my family was in a very similar situation. My older brother was successful without much help from my parents and has resentment towards them and my youngest sister and myself about things out of my control (we went on a handful of international vacations with my parents, were given cars I our early twenties, were often indulged with presents at Christmas, etc.)\n\nI really miss my brother and I don't think he will ever talk to me or be there for me. In reality, my home environment was really toxic in a way he didn't experience. My parents had a happy marriage until money came into play. My sister and I experienced consistent verbal and sometimes physical abuse from my parents that led my sister to some really dangerous behaviors and me to depression and suicidal ideation in early high school. \n\nMy older siblings didn't have that experience and my brother especially doesn't believe it and considers is spoiled if we ever talk about our problems with our parents. The physical abuse was inconsistent but the verbal abuse really destroyed me and my sister emotionally. I was browbeaten so much that I didn't have a single positive thought about myself, wasn't allowed to get my license as an 'irresponsible menace' for something like not cleaning my room so I didn't drive until I was 21 and needed a job. Our credit had been ruined by my parents and both my sister and I had earned money as kid actors burning but it was totally gone (the cars were purchased out of guilt). \n\nWe both developed depression, she struggles with severe anxiety. We both took a long time to graduate college due to mental illness. She developed addiction that ruined ten years of her life. And still my Brother can't see past his have-have not mentality. He believes that we wasted opportunities he wasn't given. Doesn't believe or care that our childhoods were vastly different in more ways than abundance. He likes the narrative of spoiled problem children and not abusive parents. He lectures us because we have very poor relationships with our parents because Mom and Dad are generally sweet and funny and charismatic. \n\nOnly now in my 30s am I finally successful with a mountain of student debt. I refused help from my anyone and avoided my parents and worked hard to get here. My sister took longer and has a lot of resentment and somewhat entitled feelings (she feels our parents should financially support her as an acknowledgment of the hardship we had to deal with as kids and money they took).\n\nAll this to say, maybe your sister has a different experience than you. Maybe she was spoiled and crippled emotionally. Maybe she has an unhealthy codependent relationship with your parents. Some things may appear one way outwardly but in fact are another. You don't have to offer your beach house to be a good older brother. Just meet up now and then for coffee and a good conversation. Maybe she is spoiled and could use a loving reality check.

They need to face a reality, and it's cruel itself: they are in 30-s, with no skills and spoiled, need to look for a job, most probably close to minimum wage - that's cruel.\n\nDon't shield them from life, don't repeat your parents' mistake. \n \n\n",

That money belongs to you (you earned it), your wife, daughter, and your future.\n\nYou can take over enabling her, but for how long?  The rest of your life?  If your sister out-lives you, will your daughter inherit the burden?  Your sister needs to learn to be an adult.

            "I know this will probably get buried, but I have some personal insight into this. My brother and SIL let her brother move into their beach condo because SIL's brother and his family fell on hard times (got laid off and had no job prospects). There were lots of promises about how long they'd live there (under 6 mos), brother and SIL could still use it, etc. After over 2 years, they ended up having to formally evict brother, which of course caused a HUGE issue with the family. \n\nSave yourself the trouble on the front end. It would be different if this was clearly temporary - if they had a new job starting in a few months but couldn't cover their bills until then - but it's not. They have no prospects and they're not going to give up free housing once they get used to it. It will cause far less angst in the family to say no now than to try to evict them in a couple of years.

This can be entirely on your terms. \n\nDon't hand out any money directly to them, if you decide to go that route. \n\nFrom what I understand, these are two adults entirely capable of working and with nothing preventing them from doing so but their laziness. \n\nIf you don't want to be a part of any of this, but still want to do something, perhaps offer to help your sister with a resume or to put her in touch with a temp agency or headhunter. \n\nThis can't be allowed to go on the way it has.",
            "If your sister doesn't learn how to grow up and take care of her own problems now, she never will. Trust me, I speak from experience.\n\n\nIn my Mom's side of the family, she was the responsible one. The one who was good with money. The one who received zero help, hand-outs, or anything from her parents. Her younger sister had been coddled and bailed out of every bad situation she got herself into. Mom was guilted by their parents into helping her. My aunt would rent a place, stop paying rent, get evicted, have nowhere to live and no money (and she was married with 3 kids) and my grandparents would drain their bank accounts to help her and then have no money to pay their mortgage. So my Mom would give them money. She bailed them out more than once when they were about to lose their house, up until she couldn't do it anymore because she got too sick and her own income became eaten up by medical bills. \n\n\nSo where do they all stand, now? My aunt is in her 50s. My Mom passed away last year following a long expensive battle with a terminal illness. My grandparents are in their 80s, with no retirement savings. They live off of their tiny pensions. My aunt is still doing the same old shit. Renting houses, not paying, being evicted, etc. My sister and I have taken on the responsibility of sending money to our grandparents because it's either that or they won't have enough money for groceries by the end of the month otherwise (they have at least stopped giving my aunt money, but only because they literally can't afford to). My aunt has ruined her middle daughter's credit by taking out accounts in her name and then defaulting on them. She will never learn, and one day she's going to be just like our grandparents..with no savings to help when she can't work anymore. So I guess it will fall to her daughters to bail her out. It's a pretty shitty cycle to get stuck in, and if you and your parents don't try to break it now for your sister, it will continue for the rest of your lives.",
            "Nope, nope, nope. Just be firm but polite. Do NOT get dragged into an argument where you have to JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain) your reasoning.

That's my final answer and I'm not going to budge.\n\nFamiily: What?? Why??\n\nYou: It's not possible.\n\nFamily: You're an awful brother! You can't even tell us why?? You're terrible!\n\nYou: This conversation is over. The decision has been made. If you keep pressing the topic, I'm going to have to hang up/leave.\n\nFamily: Oh no you don't! You tell us right now how you could have the heart to do this to your own sister!\n\nYou: I love you all very much, but this isn't productive. I'll talk to you later. [hang up/leave/stop responding]\n\nDraw boundaries. You already know what will happen if they move in, and you don't want them to. There is no way to magically make them/your parents okay with the fact that you're not going to let them stay in your home for free. You can only control your own behaviors by being polite and kind in your tone, and not getting drawn into a debate (which might lead to raised tempers & destroyed relationships). ",

Just my opinion, but everything that you just said would happen seems to be a spot-on-target assessment based on the past irresponsible actions of your younger sibling.  They'll never leave and you'll have a lifetime of resentment to deal with (both yours AND that of your wife).  Look your mother in the eye and say \"Hey Mom.  You have three bedrooms at your house, don't you?  Wouldn't (insert little sister's name here) be better off LEARNING from you if she is living in the same place?\"  Volley the ball back in her court.  Watch her squirm and try to shift the blame.  It really does sound like your parents are tired of the unreasonable behavior of their daughter.  You'll be better off in the long run if Mom and Dad are saddled with this problem because one day THEY'LL have to speak their mind/truth to your sister and possibly set her straight on some issues that you as a sibling shouldn't have to address.  As there are two sides to every story, I'm only seeing/reading this from your side of the coin.  However, I can give my opinion that if you relent and give into the demands of someone else trying to invade your peace-of-mind, you'll only be setting yourself up for the disappointment of not only losing something that you've worked very hard for YOUR own family, but also the TIME you will have to invest in dealing with your sister and her 'husband' because you've essentially become her surrogate parent by providing house and home to her and the mooching brother-in-law.  You're being forced to take over responsibilities that your Mother and Father are trying to divorce themselves from as a couple who simply don't want or feel like dealing with the headache of your sister any longer.  You didn't make her that way, THEY did and now they're dissatisfied with the results of their irresponsibility?  Think about this: what is the value of your summer home? Now...would you give your sister that much in cash? If so, build her a home someplace FAR away and treat it as a gift.  If the answer is 'No Way!' then tell her no and don't think twice about it.",

We can't even claim she's your responsibility on account of being your sister as she and you haven't got good relations and so there is no history to build on and no willingness on her part to pull her own weight. Your parents are guilttripping you because they find it easier to manipulate you, a reasonable person, than get through to their other kid, an unreasonable person. The only way to deal with this is to become just as resistant to whatever they say as your sister is. Then watch what they do. What is their plan of action if they can't be bailed out by their only reasonable, accountable family member?\n\nI say your mom is mean, not you. She is cruel and selfish, not you. Your wife is telling you to do what's right - well there is only 1 right thing to do here: stop enabling your deadbeat sister and her deadbeat husband, stop enabling your two faced parents, and if nobody is doing consequences anymore, you be the one handing them out. Wanna do what's right? What's right is to protect your family - yourself, your wife, your daughter. What's wrong is to yield to bullies such as your parents and your sister at the expense of your own family. \n\nWhat do you want to teach your daughter? Want to teach her that it's necessary to roll over and take whatever shit is dished out by Auntie and Uncle because after all Daddy does so as well? Or do you want to teach her that it's always good and right, and necessary to stand up for justice, stand up for yourself, draw lines, and not take bull, threats or blackmail from anyone, even if they're your family (or maybe especially if they're your family).\n\nThere's no need to be cruel to them, rub anything in their faces, or laugh at their misfortune. Be calm, but be a rock. Your word is final. They aren't moving in. You aren't giving them money. If they're willing to do their work, then you're willing to help (with your time - never with money, re-sellable items, or free accommodation), but the second they start pushing back, you're done. \n\nYou can sympathize with their plight, but still not let them use you. You can be concerned for them, but still not let them use you. The only reason your mom is conflating empathy and letting someone use you is because it's an effective tactic to manipulate you. Surely your sister can apply for a job at a fast-food joint and so can her husband. Surely they can move in back with your parents while they get back on their feet if they're really so worried for her.\n\nThe reason why your parents aren't inviting them is the same reason why you shouldn't take them in. Your parents know they won't be able to ever get them out again. They know your sister and her husband are leeches.

So instead of your sister hearing the hard \"no\" she needs so they can get their shit together, they probably keep getting promises from your mom that she will convince you. Every time I've been in a situation (usually been something like getting someone a job or interview, or lending/investing/donating money in something) as soon as ive gone directly to the person needing something it's pretty much ended the situation right there.

Yes, \"No\" is a complete sentence, but it also comes across cold and heartless. Deep down, your parents know they are partially responsible for your sister's failures, but they don't want to feel guilty about it.

It'll be easier to give them money than to evict them later, but only do this if you really want to and knowing the risk of not getting your money back.",
            "You could use this as an opportunity to help your sister get back on her feet and on a path to prosperity. Although I don't agree with allowing them to live in your beach house. I also don't agree with you allowing your sister and BIL live like deadbeats without pushing them ina positive direction. It sounds like you resent her for being spoiled all her life. I believe the course of action includes your parents bailing them out while you mentor your BIL so he can properly take Care of your sister. Furthermore you should probably speak to your parents about your issues with them concerning the way you were raised ",
            "Give them more handouts isn't \"what's right\". Ignore your parents and stick to your guns and say no. These are adults it's time for them to act like it. They are going to destroy your beach house and if you go the money route they will be back for more. ",

Definitely don't let them stay there - something tells me a free beach house = NOT moving out less a nasty eviction ensues. ",

They cannot get mail or package delivery at your place, you cover all the utils, etc.  They waive any claim of residence while staying at your place.  They are registered guests.

            "In my opinion, as the baby of the family and former deadbeat, she will never grow up until forced to.\n\nMy parents were constantly giving me money and helping my husband and I out. Now to be honest I had a college degree but chose to stay home with my kids and just have my husband work. I also had a multitude of health issues, so not just being lazy.\n\nAnyway, my husband and I always knew we could fall back on my parents. They would supplement our income, help with kids, etc. Then my parents financial situation changed and they couldn't. At first it was a huge struggle. Then my husband and I learned we were perfectly capable of taking care our ourselves and let me tell you...what a blessing. To believe I ourselves, to know that no matter what, if we work hard we will be fine. This also made us become better parents. We became an example to our children. If things kept going the way they were I would have had three kids who thought that depending on their parents at 30 was normal. Which it most definitely is not.\n\nYou need to have a brutally honest conversation with your parents. They are enabling your sister. If you let them live there free, you are enabling your sister being lazy. That's all it is...why work when you don't have to?\n\nShe might be mad now, but if she's forced to grow up and develops self confidence, she will come to you and thank you. You and your wife worked hard to be able to enjoy having a beach house. You shouldn't have to sacrifice that because your sister is being a child. Period. ",
            "If it's something you WANT to do you could lay guidelines. You could tell your sister you want to help her out and they can stay for a month while they get on their feet but after that they have to move out.

I can understand that on a very basic level this can look selfish (You have two homes, your sister has none, let her use one!), but in reality it could turn into a huge fucking headache.  \n\nAlso, outside of this issue, I wouldn't lean on the \"made it on my own\" thing too much IRL.  It almost always makes someone think you're a huge dickhead and does you no favors.

            "So my dad has a huge heart for others. Especially the poor because he (like you) is a self-starting man without help from his parents. He owns his own business and is very successful because of his hard work. He bought a log cabin with 15 acres in north Florida to have a place to go for vacations. He recently decided to build his own home along the beach, so he decided to make a little extra money on the side by renting out the vacation house to these people from the town. This couple (45M? 45F?) comes along and they tell him the husband just got a job in the town and are starting over their new life, but don't have enough for the security deposit, but can pay monthly. Well, they paid for the first 9 months, they would call us and tell us how great everything was, how the neighbors were good people, they would send us a check and it would always go through. Until one day, the checks start coming. We tried calling, no answer. We called the neighbors and they said they haven't heard or seen them, nor have they ever met them. So we take a small weekend trip there. When we got there, the door was swinging open in the wind. They left us a note that told us they lost their jobs because of drug use and they couldn't pay the rent, or for the damages. This is what they did: \n1) Flooded the house because they tried to do their own plumbing.\n2) Filled the washer and drier with used motor oil from the tractor, cars, etc.\n3) Ruined the flooring with cigarette burns from letting their smokes out (this was a non-smoking home)\n4) Stole every piece of kitchen utensil, pot, pan, microwave, everything\n5) Stickers placed on the walls, mirrors and windows\n6) The front lock had been kicked in and damage was around the door was extensive, all of the windows were open...\n7) They didn't mow the lawn or keep watch over the 15 acres as they said they would, we were billed from the city for that.\n8) Black mold damage from spilling a liquid substance in the attic, it sunk through and damaged the ceiling in the living room. \n9) Set up a \"burn pile\" of their trash (Not legal in the area they were renting in)\n10) They used fake names, their phones are now disconnected, and their lovely note ended with a bold \"Fuck you white man!\" (I suppose they were referring to my father)\nNeedless to say, a majority of the poor are poor for the same reason you are the wealthy man you are, because you chose it to be that way, just as they chose to bake bad decisions in life.\nDo not rent out to those losers. Don't think you are doing a 'good deed' by helping them. You need to do what is best for you and your family. Giving them your beach house is not an option.

Of course they probably still won't have their shit together, but then you can say to your mother that you've helped, you've given them a fair shot, and now it's up to them. It's not your responsibility and it's certainly not what's fair or deserved, but then charity rarely is. Giving someone a second chance is charity, anything else is enabling. ",
            "A.  I don't think letting them live rent free is a good idea.  It essentially sets the standard that they have a lease for no payment on the place.  I am not a lawyer, but this just sounds like it establishes bad precedents.\n\n B.  It think you can help them but make sure it's clear that it's temporary. You have a tenant moving into the beach house in 3 months.  They have to be out of there.

If you do decide to let them use your beach house, you establish the fact that they have to get on their feet and you do so by having an invasive approach.  What I mean to say is, they submit you a schedule every week of all their activities for that week.  They find jobs. You hire someone to check on them or have a way to check on them(they submit a picture on Instagram, you call that location, etc.). On this schedule only allow for one day to be a relaxing day, the other days have to be intentional and implicit to getting them on their feet.
