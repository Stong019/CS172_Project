        "selftext": "Hi there. I'm writing this on a throwaway because to be honest I never thought I'd need to post here but what can you do.\n\nSo I moved into this flat about 8 months ago. I met \"Lana\" online on a roommate website, and we clicked well. She's a bit younger but seemed mature. We quickly agreed to be roommates (both of us were under time constraints to find a place to live) but have got on really well so far (up until this).\n\nOur flat is a two bedroom, and to be frank, my room is clearly the better one. It's bigger and has built in wardrobes. When looking for the flat, I found the place first on my own and put down a deposit to take it off the market while I found another roommate. The flat was perfect, cheap rent and my aunt manages the property, so I was keen to snap it up before anyone else did. The area it's in is popular so I wasn't really worried about not finding someone to room with.\n\nBecause of the above and that I was there first, I took the bigger room naturally. When showing potential roommates (including Lana) round, I was sure to show the smaller room and say \"this would be *your* room\".\n\nWe moved in 8 months ago, and it's been happy families. Never heard Lana complain about her room. Because I have about 6x the wardrobe space that she does, I told her she's welcome to store her off season clothes in there, or whatever she wants to store, as long as she's not popping in every morning to get dressed. She was happy with this.\n\nJust over a month ago, I went travelling. Now I'm not the biggest fan of having people in my room, but I told Lana if she had someone stay (her sister, friends from home) they could sleep in my bed. She said thanks, and as she's been such a great roommate and rarely has guests except her boyfriend, I didn't worry at all.\n\nI came back yesterday. I was exhausted from the flight and travelling, and just wanted to shower and sleep. As I walked in Lana was in the living room with her boyfriend. We said hello and hugged, had a very quick catch up, blah blah. Then I dragged my suitcase to my room, opened the door and found it full of stuff that was not mine. I kind of yelled \"what the fuck?\" and briefly thought I was so jetlagged I was confused, but opened the door to Lana's room and saw all my stuff.\n\nI walked into the living room and asked Lana what was going on and she said \"Oh sorry, I forgot to mention, we put my stuff in your room just because it's bigger and you weren't here and you said I could use it.\" I was honestly so tired I could have passed out then, so I probably wasn't in the best state, and told her to move it all back immediately. She said they were in the middle of making dinner and I looked tired so I should have a sleep. Her boyfriend then said \"And anyway, you pay the same rent so isn't it fair that you both get the big room at some point.\" I was getting really frustrated and could feel tears welling up (hysterical from lack of sleep) so I just said \"We'll deal with this tomorrow, and it's getting moved back\" and then I went to sleep in *not* my room.\n\nI've woken up now and I'm so pissed off. Lana's at work so I can't talk to her but what should I do when she's home? I feel like this is going to turn into an argument, I don't think it'll be as simple as \"okay let's swap now you're home.\"\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: I went travelling for a month and told my roommate she could use my room for guests if needed. While I was gone she swapped all our stuff and moved into my much bigger and better bedroom. Never had a problem with her before but she doesn't seem like she's planning on swapping back. What do I do when I speak to her after work?\n\nEDIT: I've taken the advice of most people on this thread and moved my stuff back. It's taken hours and I'm knackered but I think if I left it another night it would be a real problem. I sent her a text when I was almost done (incase she kicked up a shitstorm and came home) to say \"Hi Lana! Hope you're having a nice day at work. Just to let you know I'm moving my stuff back into my room, didn't want you coming home and walking into the wrong one! :)\" (Yes I'm petty.)\n\nI'll be talking to her when she gets in because this is out of character for her, to the point of it being *bizarre*. She's never been anything but a model roommate, so I'm gonna give her a chance before we're donezo. If she wants to be reasonable and have a chat about rent portions I'm happy to do that. She's never had a problem with the rent before, and honestly I've never had uneven rent amounts in any place I've ever lived (whether I had a bigger room or smaller room) but a lot of people here are saying it's the norm so I'm open to talking about it if she's not ridiculous.\n\nEDIT 2: Lana should be home in a bit. I'll update when I can.\n\n**EDIT 3: Hi everyone, I've got about a million messages asking for an update but last night was a bit mad and I'm still pretty jetlagged so sorry but I went to sleep. Anyway, here we go.**\n\n**So as you know, I text Lana to tell her I moved my stuff back. She didn't reply to me, fine whatever, but she didn't kick off so I figured we were okay. I told my Aunt what had happened, who was as baffled as all of you, and I told her it was probably all sorted, just keeping her in the loop. I also told my boyfriend, who works about 5 mins down the road. He offered to come round, incase Lana's boyfriend came round, but I told him not to because then we're ganging up on *Lana*. He insisted on going for a \"coffee\" with his mate a couple roads away incase we needed backup. Which is a bit ridiculous but very cute of him.**\n\n**So I did get myself a glass of wine while waiting for Lana, not because I was nervous I just like wine, and she came home. I was sat in the living room and gave her a very cold \"hi\" when she walked in. She sort of froze, bag in hand, and her eyes darted between me and my/not her/our bedroom door. She blurted \"did you do it!?\" and I said \"what, move the rooms back? Yeah of course.\" and her eyes went all wide and she dropped her bag and ran into the bathroom. I could hear her talking on the phone so I was like yipeeeee I guess Tom's coming round fuuuuuun!**\n\n**I  heard the door unlock and I was about to go full hulk on how psycho she is, when she came out of the door and stood between our bedrooms. Their doors are adjacent and she just stared between them both, breathing heavily? It was really odd. Then I noticed she was crying and getting a bit panicky, so I asked what was going on.**\n\n**She burst into tears and said \"Omg he's going to kill me\" and just sobbed so yeah it was the boyfriend's idea completely, as a lot of us suspected. She's honestly always been a perfect roommate, which is kind of why I came to this sub. If she was generally an arsehole, I would have known how to act, if you know what I mean? Anyway Lana has a bit of a breakdown, and it turns out POS Tom has always been a bit of a POS, very jealous (which I always saw hints of, but Lana never mentioned so I didn't), and has amped up his POSishness while I've been away. When I left he just finished school and basically moved in unannounced, and when she'd mention he hasn't been home in days, he'd give her the \"what, don't you love me, I treat you so well, you're so selfish, blah blah\" shit and refused to move. She showed me the texts he send her, absolutely horrific stuff, things like \"ring me in the next five minutes or we're over\" \"send me a picture of you at your desk with something showing todays date so I know you're at work\", just abusive stuff.**\n\n**ON TO THE ROOM: As we guessed, he moved it. He did it while she was at work, which is actually a bit gross thinking of him going through my stuff, and I'm considering somehow implying I have crabs or something he could catch just to make him squirm a bit, but I'll work on it. lana came home and said what are you doing, he made out it was just temporary and that I wouldn't mind (such a gentleman speaking on my behalf) and he would move it back, and he was doing ti for her and she was so selfish etc. When it got a few days before I came back, Lana suggested moving it back, and he completely denied he said that and told her it was her idea to move it and he only did what she told him but it's staying now or she'd be sorry.**\n\n**So basically Tom is a prick and Lana sobbed and apologised and cried and I fed her wine. She didn't want to see Tom (who obviously assumed he lived there now) so I text him from her phone saying our Landlady (my aunt) was coming round for an inspection and staying for dinner after with my family and he couldn't come over tonight. He sent a lot of begging, whiney texts, and then went on the offensive and called Lana a liar, so I rang my aunt, *explained everything* and had her write us a fake landlord email mentioning the visit and how she was looking forward to fajitas (because she's an absolute babe and I make good packet fajitas), which we forwarded on to Tom. He left her alone for the rest of the night, apart from a few texts.**\n\n**I'm not entirely sure what we do about Tom. Lana sounds like she wants to break up, judging from her crying and screaming\" I hate him, I hate him, I hate him\" into her wine. I think she's scared to though. I checked with her and he doesn't have a key, so that's a relief. I've told my aunt everything and she said she is happy to ban him from the flat, but Lana would need ot break up with him first and get all that sorted.**\n\n**Thanks everyone for the advice. I know it wasn't the most popcorny update, but hopefully Lana will be okay, and we're going to be doing some girly shit this week and avoiding Tom and yeah, god knows what will happen.**",

            "She moved your things out when you weren't there. You're off work now, just swap things back straight away. Start with stripping the beds and changing the linen over.\n\nI wouldn't leave it till tomorrow, it normalises the situation. If she comes home whilst you're in the middle of it, just keep going or ask her to help you.\n\nHer bf should keep out of it. I assume he's lived there full-time over the last month, and he's seeing it as 'their' flat now. ",
            "Move your stuff back. This isn't even a discussion - you found the place, you made it clear the smaller was her room. Put a lock on the door and say this isn't a discussion. \n\nIt sucks she screwed herself over, but that's her problem, not yours.\n\nEdit: also if the boyfriend has been staying over all the time - nip that shit in the bud. You signed up for one housemate, not two. If he cares so much he can go rent a place with her.\n\nExtra edit: Be upfront and tell her in future she needs to a) ask because you didn't give her permission to your room and b) if she wasn't happy with the deal she should have said something or not rented the place, not this weird passive-aggressively show of dominance.",
            "Just move it back yourself while she's out. Her boyfriend d gets exactly no say. She agreed to live in the smaller room for the same rent. You are rightfully pissed.",
            "Holy fuck, this is a new different level of abusive POS. \n\nOP, I recommend you call the cops and ask them what you should do regarding Tom given his behaviour is such that he might just turn up and demand entry or force his way in.\n\nAlso with regards to Lana, (1) suggest she go visit a therapist to talk through what happened (she needs it I think, she's been in an abusive relationship), (2) tell her to send Tom a message saying they're over, and that she's blocking him on everything (and then block him on everything and/or get a new number) and that if he comes near her, she's going to the cops (and then if he does, go to the cops).\n\nAlso get your aunt to officially say that he's not allowed in the apartment - that way if the police can't do anything before hand, you be able to at least try to get him on trespassing charges when he (eventually, given his boundary stomping behaviour) turns up at the apartment.\n\nEdit to add: also, OP, given Tom is an abusive piece of shit, you and Lana should go through the apartment and specifically look for hidden cameras.  Also if you left any electronic devices (laptops, tablets), wipe them, reformat and reinstall operating systems.  If you had any accounts auto-logged in on those devices, change all the passwords and put on two-factor authentication immediately.",
            "She's established that it is okay to move things around when the other roommate is not present. Follow her rule. \n\nThen inform her that it is no longer a rule. Get a lock on your door. \n\nYour remaining time together as roommates won't be pleasant. Understand your legal options. \n\nSource: Had a roommate like this with a SO like this. Still hurts to remember. ",
            "That was extremely invasive and inappropriate of her. Move your stuff back and her stuff out. \n\nThen talk to her: \n\n* Remind her that she moved in under the understanding that she had the smaller room.\n* Tell her that if she had a problem with the rooms, she should have spoken to you first, not just moved in. Talking is what adults do.\n* Suggest she consider how she would have felt coming home after a long trip to find all her belongings have been moved.\n* Remind her that while you have the larger room, she has a boyfriend who takes up space too. Couples often pay more rent than singles. \n* Explain that you understand housemates need to communicate and negotiate, and tell her you're happy to do this, but it needs to be honest and upfront, not all cloak and daggers and *wait till she's gone*....\n\nOf course, the reason this is an issue is because you know you're getting the better end of this deal. Are you happy to discuss this? Would you pay a slightly larger share of the rent? You say that you \"naturally\" took the bigger room, but that's not necessarily the default position. I pay more rent than my flatmate because I have a slightly better room (same size, but I have a better view), and because I store some of my stuff in my flatmates room. (Like you, I found the place.) So I'd be prepared to consider what is fair as well. ",
            "This is simple. You don't need to have a discussion with her. While she's at work, move your stuff back to your room, take her off season clothes out of your closet, and install a lock. If she had an issue about the price she's paying or the size of her room, she should've negotiated that during the contract signing. Also, do not allow a third party (her boyfriend) who does not live there, dictate or comment about anything to do with that apartment. To be honest, your roommate sounds like a shitty person and opportunist under that niceness...anyone who would move all of someone's stuff out of their room is not nice. ",
            ">I fed her wine\n\nYou are a good person.",
            "Oh MAN. That UPDATE. Tom sounds like an absolute sh*tball. Glad it wasn't an effed roommate issue in the end - effed roommates are horrible - much easier to deal with tangential arsehole. I hope she sees sense and gets some help to block him out of her life.",
            "On the update:\n\n**Change the locks**.\n\nCall your Aunt *now* and *CHANGE THE LOCKS*. (in normal non-Aunt landlord situations, you need to ask the landlord's permission, so you could/should still do it here) Lana may have never given him keys- but I'll bet money he had access to them, and he could have made copies. *So change the fucking locks*.\n\nOnce the locks are changed:\n\n* Ask your aunt if you can install security cameras, and do so\n* Get to /r/legaladvice and find out if you have enough for a restraining order in your area. Or go to a lawyer/solicitor in your area.\n* Go to the police and make a statement. This guy moved all of your belongings and is threatening your roommate. That should be enough for a statement at minimum, and if he tries anything else there'll be a record.\n* If you have enough for a restraining order, pursue one. \n\nFor Lana:\n\n* Ask her if you can have screenshots of his texts.\n* If she's able to, she should go to the police as well. If the texts are threatening enoguh, that may be enough for a restraining order. If she isn't up to that, that's okay.\n* She should see if there are any counseling options in the area. She's getting out of an abusive relationship, that's hard and scary.\n* She sounds like she isn't the problem, so I think it's fair to say be gentle with her. \n* Mentally steel yourself. It's not uncommon for people to go back to their abusers. She may \"give him another chance\". I hope she doesn't, don't expect that she does, don't act as if she will. But keep that possibility in the back of our mind and steel yourself for it. (this is one reason to pursue a restraining order- even if Lana gets back with him, he won't be allowed in your flat and you'll be protected)",
            "It seems unlikely that you two will be coming to an amicable solution to this.  She just decided to move your shit because she wanted to and it's unlikely that she's going to back off now.  \n\nIs her name on the lease, since you paid the deposit and all that?  Did she pay you back for what you paid in the deposit?  \n\nI would suggest that you just try to talk to her, without her boyfriend present so they can't gang up on you, and explain to her that since you found the apartment and kept it off the market while searching for a roommate that the larger bedroom is yours.  She agreed to the initial rent price when she moved in, knowing full well which bedroom would be hers.  It doesn't matter if it's fair, it's what she agreed to do and she did not voice any concerns up front.  If she wanted to renegotiate the terms of the deal she should have done that when she first moved in, rather than wait for you to leave and take matters into her own hands.  \n\nIf her name isn't on the lease you can probably evict her yourself since she would be subletting from you.  If she is on the leash it's probably unlikely that you'll be able to do much about it.  I would go talk to your landlord immediately and inform him that since you reserved the apartment first, you intend to keep it at the end of the lease and your roommate will not be signing back on.  You might be able to get \"dibs\" on keeping the place when your lease it up and essentially force her out at that time.  ",
            "I know she says he doesn't have a key, but that's not a chance you should take. You need to change your flat lock *immediately*. Neither of you have any idea if he \"borrowed\" it and made a copy. I don't want to be alarmist, but this guy sounds possibly dangerous. ",
            "I don't know why you're trying to be amicable and fair with her when she didn't give you the same - what a massive invasion of privacy. She literally touched all your personal shit with NO PERMISSION in order to do this, I would be so disturbed. Call a big strong friend over as back up, text your roommate that you are moving shit back (you don't even owe her a heads up but that's about as nice as you need to be), and get going. ",
            "Move her shit back into her room.",
            "Shes at work? GREAT! Time to move your shit back. Once you have done it she will know you are not a doormat. She had this planned for ages and used this trip of yours as the perfect chance. \n\nAs for her smartass BF? He's now banned from coming over or hes paying rent. But seriously, what ever friendship you had with this girl is done and dusted. Only 4 months left, so move your shit back and be cordial then find another roommate who isnt a total shit kicker.",
            "Please support Lana to break up with Tom. She's obviously a vulnerable person and Tom is a predator. ",
            "If /r/relationships was responding to a post Lana made, we would definitely be pushing her to break up with Tom. Tom IS abusive-- no one should be scared of their own boyfriend. I think it's good to have some girl intervention time, tell her just how bad it is, and how important it is to herself to break up with him, like, now.\n\nI wouldn't blame Lana for just sending a break up text out of fear for confronting him. Go full blown No Contact and be seriously prepared to call the cops if he starts stalking her or showing up. ",
            "Umm i cannot believe she did this. So passive aggressive. And she said nothing to you when you arrived? She planned to have you go access your room, see the switch, and what...Happily go along? She knew when you were returning and her bf was there and prepped to say the line about 'whats fair blah blah blah.\" I would stick with that as a central theme in your conversation with her. I would also ask her to move out at the end of the 12 month period. She had dozen other options, such as contacting you while on your trip \"hey, i stayed in your room and am feeling like i am being taken advantage of for how much larger it is, can we talk about it when youre back?\" It is completely inappropriate that she had her bf participate in this conversation. You should also say \"i signed up for one roommate not two and i have never said a word about the frequency of guests you have. You want to make things fair, ill pay $80 more and you can only have a guest 2 nights a week maximum. Sound fair?\" Make sure if you do any sq footage based rent math you deduct the common areas from the total before dividing by two. People always divide the total sq footage and thats not the right way to do it.",
            "I'm glad you're being a good friend to Lana! It sounds like she needs the support. I do have a concern, though, as far as keeping you two safe - she says he doesn't have a key, is it possible he made a copy at any point? You may want to ask your aunt about having the locks changed just to be safe.

Ban him, for your own safety... even if the roomie isn't strong enough to break up with him, he should never set foot on the property ever again. He's dangerous and you cannot trust him to be 2 feet away from you while you sleep. Do not take this gross violation of your privacy lying down.",

Whether it was her boyfriend who egged her on or whether it was pent up aggression abouT the smaller room... it is of no consequence. Your reaction to this will dictate her reaction once you confront her. Choosing to talk first shows a sort of spineless mess/weakness, and from there she will be so so so unlikely to move her shit back EVER. You need to move her things back now and put a lock on your door. Maybe video the move so she can't say you stole or manhandled any of her shit. Then when she arrives home you fucking rip in to her. If her BF is there he unfortunately can't come over today, you and roomie are about to have a house meeting and he's not part of the house. \n\n\n\nI'd also get a dropcam/nanny cam just to ensure the safety of your belongings.

Later you can take up the topic of switching rooms, but the two things ought to be decoupled, and she ought not to be rewarded for moving your shit in the middle of the night. Then, later, you can let her know your position that the room you rented her is the room she needs to stay in and that, if she wanted the other room instead, or wanted to room-swap periodically, this was something she should have brought up at the time you were selecting roommates because it's not something you'd have agreed to at the time, either.

I live in the UK and here there are technically rules for how long you can stay somewhere before you live there, if he's found to be living their but not legally registered for council tax there he's breaking the law. You could always use something like that against him if worse comes to worse.",
            "You're being to kind here. She moved your shit with no regard, now you do the same with the addition of a lock/deadbolt on your door. They've already proven they can't be trusted, how far are you willing to let this go?",
            "Sounds like the lease is in your name, plus you have the familiy hook up - this is **your** apartment, and she rents a room. You did all the legwork and took all the risk, you're entitled to the larger room. Real simple: she moves her stuff back ASAP, or you do it for her. Put a lock on your door.  She agreed to the rent she pays for the space she got. If she doesn't like it, tell her to find a new place to live. The boyfriend gets ZERO say in this; don't let him be involved in any discussion between you and her, and if he tries to bring it up, shut him down.",
            "Glad to see you moved your stuff back. \n\nTime to plan a conversation in which you explain: \n\n1. Rent and layout was agreed to before roomate moved in. If she had a problem with it then, she should have said something. If she had a problem with it now, she should have said something. She should not have invaded your personal space and changed the terms of your tenancy without talking to you. In the US (not sure where you are but guessing by slang its not US), that would be illegal. \n\n2. If shes not willing to talk about issues she has with you, then perhaps its time for her to find another roomate. Remind her of whatever the minimum notice is for her to end her tenancy. \n\n3. Yes, its probably fair that you pay more for your room if its significantly better. Figure out if and how much more youre willing to pay. If she brings up the cost discrepancy let her know that number. Let her know you are entirely uninterested in moving rooms. If you guys change the split of the rent, get it in writing what you're each obligated to pay and what youre paying to use/inhabit. No more of this funny business later on. \n\n4. Your room will now be locked. She is not welcome to be in it for any purpose. Make sure you get a key lock, not a pin lock. \n\n5. Boyfriend may not live there. Explain you dont want to make assumptions about what they have been doing while you have been gone but that you just want to be clear about that- boyfriend is not a tenant and may not live there. \n\nExpect things to go... poorly. Start looking for a new roomate. ",
            "Wow this is crazy, I can not wait to hear edit 3!",
            "I'm on the edge of my seat. Hoping your roommate does the right thing and deals with it. It's not her damn room period. ",
            "OP get a lock for your room. Your roommate is going to move her stuff back in when you're out of the house. ",
            "Cool update. After reading that though I feel like you should discuss rent portions/split. ",
            "Commenting for the spicy update",
            "Move your stuff back to your room, move her shit to the living room, and lock your door from now on. What a weird fucking thing to do. ",
            "Rude.\n\nYou were super generous to let her use your wardrobe for off-season clothing, and let people crash in your room while you were gone. She took advantage of that. If she wanted to effectively move in there temporarily, she should have asked. If she felt that you should take turns with the bigger room, or that it's unfair to pay 50/50 when the difference in room size is significant, that's something she should talk to you about when you're there, not something she can just go and *do* while you're gone and expect you to gracefully deal with when you get back.\n\nAlso, it does sound like her boyfriend is an unofficial third tenant. That's not cool. This isn't a wedding, her name on the lease doesn't come with a \"plus one.\" Not only are you sharing with more people than you'd like, when a roommate has a significant other who practically lives there, they effectively monopolize whatever room they're in. Either the living room is \"theirs\" while they watch TV together, or the kitchen is \"theirs\" while they cook together, and you're always having to work your life around where they are. It stinks, and you shouldn't have to put up with that.\n\nIf you have enough time to find a new roommate for the next lease, maybe it's time for these two to get their own place and for you to find a more considerate roommate. But this time, offer to pay more than half the rent if you want to keep the bigger room.",
            "Thats a super immature tactic of just moving her stuff without saying anything and hoping you'll just let it go. I remember people used to do shit like this in my teens/early 20s. The key here is for you to be active not passive in all your actions and directly confront her head on after moving your stuff back. If the bf is there tell him that unless he is paying rent he has no say in the discussion and needs to leave while you and your roommate work it out. The combo of these two tactics of direct communication while disabling her bf safety net will overwhelm your passive roommate and she will likely acquiesce without much of a struggle. Good luck! ",
            "Glad that at least you are not one of those people who come here asking if it is ok for you to be angry about something like this",
            "If she wasn't happy about having the smaller room she should not have agreed to move in.",
            "I don't know why her boyfriend feels like he has any right to speak on this issue at all. It's not his apartment. If it was me, I would just move my stuff back into my room the second she is out of the house. \n\nNow, it sucks, because this situation is probably going to turn ugly and the friendly roommate relationship between you guys is probably over once you move her shit out of the room. But, sometimes that is just how it goes. ",
            "[removed]",
            "I know it was pretty much taken care of but if you room is sooo much bigger and better that it is easily noticeable than you are kind of wrong for charging the same amount.  Normally in houses were there is a decent difference than you do something by square feet or something like knock 15 bucks off her monthly rent....if college age kids are decent enough to do this than it is pretty shameful to expect her to pay the same as you for a smaller room. \n\nJust saying.

I have always been an introverted man, my ideal night is a quiet one in-front of the tv with my wife. I loved raising my 3 kids and was sad to see them go when they left but was also happy that they was living their own lives and I could enjoy the piece and quiet that I hadn't had for a long time. All of my children are married now, my eldest (32M) is living a successful life with his wife and children. But my daughter quickly lost her job and couldn't find a new one and relied on her husband's (31M) wages but had 3 children (6F, 5M, 3F) despite it not really being financially viable. They fell behind on rent and couldn't support themselves so they all moved in with my wife and I. Then my other son and his wife (26F) had 2 children (4M, 1F) and they made a lot of financially bad decisions including buying an expensive car from a unreliable person. It turns out the car was stolen and it was taken by the authorities and my son lost a lot of money on it. They too couldn't keep up with bills and looking after their children so moved in with us. My wife welcomed them with open arms.\n\nMy wife enjoys the quiet life like me but she is also more of an extrovert and she loves having the kids and grand-kids around. But this is a nightmare, I thought my days of being a parent and running after kids was over but it feels like I am doing it now more than ever. I shouldn't have too put up with this at my age I have done my job as a parent and I shouldn't have to do it again. I get no peace at all I can't read a book for 5 mins without being interrupted by a screaming child. It's horrible having 11 people crammed into one house, granted it's a big house but still. Even going to toilet is such a pain because I always have to wait for multiple of my family members to go first. What's really annoying is that everyone else seems very happy with this arrangement. I know they are all looking for jobs but I don't particularly see them putting in maximum effort to find somewhere else to stay. I am really reaching the end of my tether and when i tried to talk to my wife about it she was appalled with me saying that you don't stop being a parent once your kids move out and I should help them in their time of need. I sort of feel like she is right but at the same time I just can't stand this anymore. What do I do?\n\nTL;DR- My grown up kids, their partners and their children have all moved in with me and my wife. Ruining my ideal quiet life",

            "This is such a tough situation. I\u2019m sure everyone is trying to make the most of it. Try to sit the kids down and work through two plans. 1) you need breaks from the chaos. This means that your kids need to take the grandkids out of the house for long stretches a few days a week. Lots of things are still closed from coronavirus but they can go on hikes and picnics. 2) they need a long term commitment on finding work and moving out. This is stickier because the job market is so weird right now. But they need a plan. They need to work out budgets to figure out the minimum amount they need to make to afford an apartment and move out. Then apply for every single job in that salary range. You can do this. It\u2019s tough times for everyone and it\u2019s good to watch out for your family but you definitely need some relief.",
            "I\u2019m not a parent but when my coworker needs a nap he tells the kids to wake him up in half an hour so they can clean the house together. Tells them about all the fun they\u2019ll have doing chores together and they do anything to avoid waking him up.",
            "Sit down with your wife and come up with a game plan together so you're on the same page.  You should emphasize for her 'I don't want to throw them out, I just want to set a timeline so that they continue to look- there's a big difference between saving them when they're in trouble once in a while and babying them so they never become independent adults.  We're they're parents- we need to teach them to stand on their own two feet.'\n\nThen sit down with each of the pairs of couples (seperately) and say 'you know we love you, you know we support you, but we're on month X of this and it's time to start thinking of what is going to come next.  Your mother and I were happy to take you in but it's time for us to enjoy a quiet retirement- so talk to us about your plan for transitioning out of here?  We're not going to throw you out tomorrow but it is time to start communicating about what comes next, and when.'\n\nWhoever moved in first should probably get a bit more pressure to move than whoever moved in second.\n\nBUT I've gotta say, as someone who's also unemployed and job hunting during the corona pandemic... it might be a little while longer!  I apply for five jobs a day every single day for the last three months.  One, I applied on the day it was posted and went back a week later and there were more than 1000 other applicants.  I'm applying for stuff in my field I'm badly overqualified for and not getting interviews.  I'm editing my MA off my resume and applying for jobs bagging groceries, working in fast food chains, mopping floors and answering lines in call centres and I'm not getting interviews.  What you perceive as them 'not really trying' might really be there not being jobs.  There is NOT a lot of work out there, and a LOT of unemployed people out there.  You might have a few more months of this ahead of you.\n\nWhat you could also think about is some new household rules in the meantime that subtly make it easier on you; quiet time Sundays or 'everyone has to leave to go on a hike somewhere nice and socially distanced' Tuesdays.  A bathroom upstairs that is off limits to kids.   More coping skills for you that subtly make you more comfortable and them slightly more inconvenienced, to make it survivable in the meantime and to continue to light a fire under them to look for the next thing.",
            "At very least, set some boundaries with all of the people in the house. Schedule quiet/do not disturb times for yourself; maybe have some places off limits to grandchildren. Decide together who is responsible for what childcare, meals, cleaning/chores. Treat them more like roommates than your children, expect them to chip in and be respectful of your time and space. \n\nLet them know you care about them but this is a major imposition and you would love to see them back on their own two feet asap! And maybe they could get you some noise cancelling headphones for fathers day!",
            "How's your house? Could you perhaps have a shed/workshop with heat and other stuff in the back garden, and place some of your \"I wanna chill\" stuff and let it be off limit to others - or have a study and put a lock on it and use it as your space?",
            "You're still they're dad and they're adults. Talk to them. Work out a game plan. They're not going to get their situation sorted overnight, especially in a pandemic. But, you should be cool as a cucumber having hard conversations with your adult children. What's the internet gonna tell you that you and your kids don't already know? They need to be working on moving out (which I think they are) and sometimes you have to love your children more than you love your quiet.\n\nYou can even talk to them about how you're lacking a need for quiet and solitude. I think your family can help you more than we can.",
            "A) make them contribute significantly while they are there.  That means cooking and cleaning and contributing financially.  This should not be just a free ride \n\nB) is it possible to dedicate either some place in the house or build some sort of man-shed where you can escape?  You definitely need somewhere quiet you can get away, you\u2019ve earned it",
            "I had moved back in with my parents when I was in my mid-twenties, albeit under different circumstances than you describe. One if the things I appreciated then was that it gave me the chance to develop an adult relationship with them. Do you feel like you have an adult relationship with your kids? If so, then you should talk about this with them directly. If not, then you (and your wife) need to establish one. \n\nBeing a parent is for life, but now that your kids are parents themselves they should understand that your time to yourself is important, and respect that. I\u2019d suggest you also tell your wife that part of what you feel like you\u2019re missing out on is quality time with her! \n\nThe best thing you can do is to be both open and supportive. Don\u2019t let your kids and grandkids know you resent them being there. Do let your kids know you\u2019re expecting them to be actively trying to get back on their own feet. Try to encourage rather than push.",
            "Hi OP! Your certainly getting lots of advice, but I think some of it is very insensitive to you, and I would anticipate not a lot of commenters here are parents of adult children (and neither am I).\n\nBased on your replies, it sounds like you and your wife are doing a lot of work to help them, beyond just a place to live. You should not be cooking dinner and cleaning up after getting home from work. You also should not have to be playing babysitter when there are multiple parents not working. That isn't okay, and the fact that the 5 other adults (wife and children/spouses) in the house think it is tells me there is some underlying problems here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Talk to your wife. Explain your feelings, and that if she cannot get on board, you will need to spend some money on a private space of your own (man-shed, make a space in your bedroom like a living room, etc.)\n2. You and your wife need to stop cleaning up after everyone. If she doesn't want to stop, then you need to say that you are no longer helping and that is her decision.\n3. The adults need to have a schedule. M/W family XX is responsible for dinner and clean up, T/Th family YY is responsible. This includes budget for groceries. You and your wife should not be paying for everything for the entire clan. By going over budgets with the kids, you can say \"You need to contribute $100 per family towards food, and we will cover the rest.\" or whatever works for you.\n4. Timeline. It is just enabling to have no set plan. Yes, there is a pandemic, but that doesn't mean live with mom and dad indefinitely. Do they want to buy a house? Rent again? Sit down with all 4 adults, explain your feelings, and then explain you'll be sitting down again with each couple to discuss a budget and clear plan.\n5. Be prepared to \"be the bad guy.\" Sometimes we all need tough love. And, this may go for your marriage. You may need to express to your wife that you want it to just be the two of you, but for your sanity, if by the end of the year there isn't a change, you will need to find a more peaceful place to live. Then she has to make some choices.\n\nYou've work hard for a long time and deserve to enjoy your retirement. It is so kind that you guys are helping, but some set boundaries need to happen for everyone's wellbeing! If your wife wants to be a martyr, that's her choice, but you don't have to participate also.\n\nEdited to add: Your retirement monies should not be used to supplement their families. That is unfair to you and not financially smart, which I'm sure you realize!\n\nGood luck!",
            "Ah, there is a traditional Jewish story about this. Man goes to his rabbit with same issue. Rabbi says to bring his goat into the house. \n\nMan comes back a few days later saying Rabbi, that was a terrible idea. Rabbi says, you're right. The goat wasn't enough, bring your sheep into the house too.\n\nMan come back a few days later saying rabbit now it's worse than before.  Rabbit says you're right. The goat and sheep aren't enough. Bring your cow into your house too.\n\nMan comes back a few days later and says Rabbi this is impossible.  Everyone is cramped, the house is bedlam and it smells horrible.

            "My thoughts might be somewhat different than other responses but I noticed a usage of the terms we and us that is worth reflecting on a little bit deeper. You use we and us as you and your wife. And the life that you imagine is actually based on you. You and your needs and what you want and what is ideal for you, and you include your wife in that fantasy (the world you imagine and crave) without really thinking about her as separate from you, or at the very least without thinking about how her needs differ from yours.\n    Now separate from your usage, it seems that in your wife\u2019s heart the terms we and us includes your children and grandchildren and that will never change for her. That\u2019s the world she created with you, you made children together, it includes you but it also includes them, and it always will that\u2019s why she said you don\u2019t stop being a parent when... she may never be able to enter the world or version of \u201cwe and us\u201d and that you desire. \n   Now it seems to me that it would be like trying to move a mountain to change her or the situation, not that conversations don\u2019t need to be had about your children taking responsibility for their own lives, but that will take time and in the current situation you are having a struggle with getting your own needs met, and that is important. You matter, but your needs are not everyone else\u2019s. \n  It might be worth taking a little bit of time to focus on you, taking up a hobby like fishing or something where you can get out and find the quiet and peace you need, finding ways to have alone time and the separateness you need. You can start creating that space on your own. You can start building and working on that without needing any one else\u2019s cooperation. \n  Now I realize you also want to include your wife in that, that you want quiet and alone with her, retirement and such. So maybe you can invite her into the quiet spaces you create, on a fishing trip. Time out from the day to watch the sunset together just you and her, hold on to it, cherish it and then let it go, because she needs to be a mom too and that\u2019s not ever going to go away or change. Love is like a wave, it comes and goes, you can\u2019t catch it or hold onto it but it always returns. Peace and quiet and alone time can be like that too. And she probably doesn\u2019t need or want as much quiet alone time as you do, but you can still have moments.",
            "Helping family is a noble thing, but help should always come with limits. Letting them live with you for six months is perfectly fine, but beyond that creates and environment of enablement where the bird comes back to the nest and has no motivation to leave. So long as that time limit exists and there is some stress on them, it should be fine for you both.",
            "You and your wife need to talk about the timeline for this situation and come to a compromise. \n\nI couldn\u2019t help but wonder about all of the reasons she enjoys having such a full house. You say you enjoy the peace and quiet and love just watching tv with your wife. But... does she? Are you making sure she is having a great empty-nest life with you? This issue should be part of your conversation.",
            "Right now, it does not seem like your kids have a game\nPlan or are going to be moving out anytime soon. You may offer some help to get them working towards that goal of being more independent.\n\nI would start to have a calm conversation with your children (separately and privately) about their timeline and game plan for their future and getting back out on their own. Just simply starting out with, so how are things going? I am sure that things have been hard for you all and you are probably eager to be out on your own again. Is there anything I can do to help? \n\n\nUnfortunately, you might need to find some ways to have some peace and quiet outside of the home. Maybe you and your wife can go away on vacation for a a week or 2 so you can have some time together and you can get your peace. I know the struggle because I am the same way and need my quietness and time alone.",

            "Your wife is correct, you don't stop being a parent and you should want to help your kids. On the other hand, when you move back in with a parent, you don't stop being an adult. You pay rent, even if it is a very low affordable rent. I lived with both parents on and off and always paid rent, even if it was 200 a month. Something to keep me accountable. My 19 year old son lives with me, he works, pays rent to me and pays for his own car and other expenses. He still does a chore and helps around the house but he has much more freedom to do whatever he wants compared to the other kids. Make the families pay rent and help out and find a way to get your private time in, maybe a garage or shed for yourself when you need time away.",
            "I don\u2019t care who you are or what age, having 5 kids under the age of 6 under one roof is INSANE. Add to that the extra adults and it probably feels like a zoo. While I sympathize greatly with the financial woes of your millennial children, I can\u2019t comprehend why neither of them aren\u2019t scrambling to get their ducks in a row to get out of there. I have 3 young kids myself and I feel like your living situation sounds like a painful disaster. \n\nI think one way you could approach the conversation with your wife (besides obviously saying you feel like you\u2019re struggling personally I\u2019m terms of space) is to explain the positive aspects of independence for your kids. As parents, encouraging your children\u2019s growth is paramount. Of course being helpful in their time of need is important, but the goal should always be to push them to become the best versions of themselves, whether that be figuring out how to manage their finances better, run a household independently, or find a steady career. They are both well into adulthood and I assume their spouses are too. Kicking back at their parents house for an extended amount of time is potentially going to limit their own personal growth. \n\nHow about you discuss a timeframe with them? Settle on reasonable move-out dates with each of them based on their situations, and maybe if there\u2019s an end in sight you will have an easier time dealing with the chaos in the meantime. That is way too many little kids under one roof, so I applaud you and your wife for being as supportive as you are!",

            "Maybe this has been said, but I'm thinking you probably have more than one bathroom in a \"big house\". You can establish some boundaries on that front and designate one of them as yours (and your wife's?). Especially if you have a master bath, it should be a no-brainer. \n\nI know this isn't the crux of the matter, but you've gotten plenty of good advice on the big picture issues.

You two are a team and having a mutual agreement on what is okay and what is not is important. And while she is right that you dont stop being a parent, parents shouldnt enable their children to make poor choices. On what conditions is it okay for them to stay? All reasons and indefinitely?

            "I had to live with my in-laws once upon a time with a baby too. I wanted out as soon as we got there. They however loved having us and never wanted us to leave. I was basically OP in this story. I needed my space and my time alone as much as possible. I didn\u2019t want to have to greet anyone and have obligations to small talk just because we both happened to be in the kitchen at the same time. My BIL ended moving back in too. It was quite a time. Above all, I hated being stuck doing laundry 1 day a week.\n\nSince I\u2019ve been in the inverse of this situation and know how irritating it CAN be for the adult children, I\u2019ll give you a list of the most annoying things you can do to \u201cmotivate\u201d them to get out. \n\n1) First and foremost, make sure you try to parent the grandkids in subtle but clearly different parenting style than your kids do. (Normally this is a huge no-no, but it\u2019s annoying without being too much). Maybe give the kids sweets when they shouldn\u2019t have any. Get the kids really wound up right before bedtime. Things like that. \n\n2) Start a home project in one of the rooms they are staying in. You have all this time and \u201chelp\u201d around, now is the perfect time to makeover the spare bedroom into your future library. Also be sure to get this project started enough that they have to move their things out of there and sleep somewhere else for a few nights. Tell them it\u2019s just a few nights but then stall on it. Claim you lost motivation or haven\u2019t decided on the finishing touches yet. \n\n3) Pull the famous line \u201cas long as you\u2019re under my roof, you\u2019re under my rules!\u201d I think this is self explanatory. Tread lightly.\n\n4) I would use this one with caution, because you don\u2019t want to sour any relationships with family. However, you can try to pick apart differing beliefs you have with your kids. Maybe go on some rants. Rants for days. The same subject. Just keep bringing it up. This can eventually get stale and frustrating for listeners. \n\n5) Make tuesday (any day) cleaning day and everyone MUST help, no excuses. Then be sure to require really deep cleaning techniques. Wipe down the walls. Dust the ceiling. Clean the baseboards. Etc \n\n6) Assign each family a day of the week they can do their laundry and ONLY that day. This was enough to drive me to insanity. \n\n\nThis is my real life experience. This is totally passive aggressive to do this intentionally. I don\u2019t necessarily recommend it nor condone it. It did work to get us out of my in laws tho.\n\n\n\nEdit 1: My first award! Thanks award bestower!\n\nEdit 2: It\u2019s called Satire",
            "Definitely help them come up with a concrete plan. Check that they're sending out resumes weekly, if not daily. Even if the job isn't ideal - I've heard of many people getting jobs with uber eats or door dash during COVID. It might not pay enough to get them out of the house right away, but they can start setting some money aside for moving out.\n\nMake sure they pull their weight around the house - including the kids that are old enough to do so. Under no circumstances should you be mowing your lawn or taking the trash out. That's their job now. Same with cooking and cleaning (unless, of course, you and/or your wife enjoy these tasks).\n\nTry to carve out an area in your house, preferably with a door that closes, that is just for you, and your wife if she needs it. I usually cringe at the idea of a \"man cave\" but this is one of those circumstances where it is needed. Make it perfectly clear that the only people allowed in this space are the ones whose names are on the deed.\n\nFinally, I think it's important that you ALL try to do things as a family once in a while. That may seem counter-intuitive but if you don't have some fun with them, you will quickly grow to resent them. Take everyone out for mini golf, have a barbecue, go on a family hike. Just something light and fun to break up the stress of having 11 people under your roof.",

            "I identify with your kids so I would like to share my story, briefly, if I may.\n\nI am a 33 yr old female. My parents are only a couple of years older than you. When I was 19 I had zero self esteem and got into a relationship with the first guy who showed me any attention (shocker, he was a dirtbag) and I ended up pregnant. That guy ended up stealing a bunch of money from me so I kicked him out and there I was: 21, single mom, no prospects. Working retail but unable to make ends meet and getting no child support whatsoever.\n\nMy mom welcomed my son and I back home with open arms. Conversely, my dad (like you) had felt he had \"done his time\" parenting and no longer felt it was their job to help me. That it was \"sink or swim\" time for me.\n\nI could feel the contention. Every day living at home I could sense how much he DIDN'T want me there. And it made me feel awful. I didn't want to be a burden - I didn't want to cause tension between my parents, either. And yet, there I was, being a burden and causing tension.\n\nAnyway, I went back to college and got my degree in a healthcare related field. Just a few years after moving in I was able to move back out and financially support my son and myself on my income, alone.\n\nMy mom died suddenly just six months after I moved out. \n\nMy dad got remarried. And he got to have the child-free retirement he always wanted. I have stayed away - precisely because of how he spoke about what a burden I was - because of how he treated me with such contention when I needed help. I might see him a few times a year but I wouldn't consider us \"close\" and I wouldn't consider our relationship \"happy\". That's the thing - I knew he didn't want me there. He told me so. And it made me feel awful. As a child you rely on your parents for everything: but especially love and protection. That need doesn't necessarily go away when you hit 18 just because the law says you're an adult now. To have my dad turn his back on me when I desperately needed his love and support at 21 was a betrayal I will never forget. \n\nAnd now, ten years into his retirement the luster of the quiet life of being with his new wife has worn off. Taking the camper out, mowing the lawn, watching TV all day has gotten boring. And he has started reaching out to me to reconnect.\n\nAnd I do not reply to his communications. \n\nA child's need for their parent doesn't stop at age 18. Turning your back on them now might get you the quiet you want but it may irreparably damage your relationship with them - and your grandkids, by extension. Think carefully about how you want to handle this. I know you may crave the quiet life with just your wife now - but what about 10 yrs down the road when your kids and grandkids want nothing to do with you because you pushed them out in their hour of need because you wanted quiet time? How they will feel betrayed that their father didn't love them enough to support them when they needed help? They will carry that with them for the rest of their life.",

It's nice and all to help your adult children out, but you're all done being responsible for their basic needs. \n\nI need quiet time too, and I usually feel better if I at least have a door to close, and it's understood that I am to be left alone.

They have wisdom to share. Just because I\u2019m an adult doesn\u2019t mean I have the world figured out, no one really does but forsure not at my age. You\u2019re still a parent at the end of the day, talk to your kids about exploring their  options and what measures they could take.  If I were at my parents with no job my first priority would be getting out! \nUntil then maybe you can find a quiet place or man cave to relax.

With your wife tell her it's impacting your mental health, because it does when you don't have time or space for yourself and different people need different things. \n\nIt is going to be hard right now due to the pandemic, but I think your best bet right now is to be encouraging and if you can carve out some space for yourself somewhere and let everyone know it's your space.

Of course I hate this but I\u2019m not going to repeatedly tell me parents that I hate living in their house and I can\u2019t wait to move out! Just like they\u2019re not going to tell me that they\u2019re desperate for me to leave and give them back their peace.

            "I would have strict requirements for my adult children, (and their children), living under my roof due to the types of circumstances you described - poor decisions and mostly situations that are under their control. There would be a clearly defined timeline, and expectations relating to how much effort they put into getting back on their feet. And I would charge them rent, at a competitive market rate so that living with me wasn't much cheaper than living out in the world. I would do this because like you, I want to be done with raising children in my older age and I want quiet, but also because I want to teach and/or force my children to be self-sufficient because I won't always be around. \n\nIf it's very easy for your children to fall down in life and have your home as a fallback option with no strings attached, then it stands to reason that they aren't going to feel the since of urgency they would if they had no other options. \n\nI don't think there is anything wrong with the ways you are feeling. If you have communicated you feelings and needs with your wife and she completely disregards them, however, then I don't know what advice to give as far as a resolution. I'm sorry.",
            "I am the in the kids' position here. My husband and I have been living in my parent's house before and after my dad died in '16. My dad was actually the one who cried to me on the phone when I was about 7 months pregnant, worried about my living situation and begged me return home. I listened, and it was the biggest mistake of my life. I say this because if you truly feel this way, you need to talk to your wife.. NOW. Because God forbid something happens to her - you will be even more stuck with your adult children.\n\nI will admit my flaws - I have found living back here makes it so hard to save money, since I unfortunately got used to not having to pay rent I was able to get my daughter things she could've gone without. They let me be a stay at home mom for a few years when I should've been working to get us out of here. Thanks to income taxes and the stimulus we finally have a good chunk of change but it doesn't do us much good since we moved back into and also work in an area that is way out of our budget.. and truthfully have no help when it comes to knowing where to go that's a bit more affordable for us without also having to leave our jobs.\n\nNow covid hit and our chances of actually getting out are even harder. \n\nTalk to your wife if you truly feel this way. From what you described though.. I'm warning you - your kids have no plans of leaving. Whether they want to or not, they definitely won't be gone any time soon. I know my mom is happy she was not left alone after my dad died but I know deep down she wants her house back. And I'm in no position right now to be able to get it to her. I know a few years ago she was ready to give us some money to help us move out but with dad gone she can no longer afford to do so.\n\nSorry that dragged on a bit. But your feelings ARE valid.",

Tell her what you wanted to be doing at this time in your life.  \n\nYou could try couples counseling so there is a mediator.  Set rules with your children to control their offspring....it's not your job- especially if one of the parents isn't working!!  Tell them you want proof of job searches.  Better yet if you can afford it  pay for a financial class for them..Financial Peace University is great. \n\nYou could pack a suitcase and go stay in a hotel for a weekend...with or without your wife.... just to get some peace and quiet.  Maybe that will open your wife's eyes.  \n\nUltimately, if it gets too much to bear and the grown kids aren't making good enough progress/effort to get out on their own it might come down to an ultimatum: the kids find somewhere else to live or you will.

His grown daughter (40F), though, was in and out of drug rehab, stole from my \"FIL\" all the time. Literally no respect for her father at all. Daughter and daughter's boyfriend free-loaded off of them. Neither lifted a finger to do a thing. Neighbor's wife, though, would NOT hear of them moving out, regardless of how much was stolen, destroyed, and sucked dry from neighbor and wife. \n\nMy husband and I repeatedly tried to encourage him to talk to his wife further, to the point of begging him, bc it was affecting his health.

He died last August and never did get to travel or do anything he wished bc his daughter just drained his bank account with all her crap. \n\nPlease sit down with your wife. Have a difficult heart to heart with her. YOU are her #1 and partner, now that her babies are adults.

With that being said my parents feel they have a right to stay and use the guest room when ever and how ever long they wanted initially.  But the fact we have 2 different house hold under the same roof makes things complicated and interpret both parties life style.  For you I imagine it is even more chaotic since there so many people and 3 different houses holds. There need to be ground rules, people need to have alone times, and if people don't abide by the rules that all agree on there will be built up resentment and animosity in the home if things left unspoken.

Do you have a garage, attic, under-balcony space, or similar, and the DIY skills and/or funds to build one? Pop a couch in there big enough for naps, install a lock, and make it a suitably Manly space. Do this even if it's not your aesthetic. What you're trying to do is piggyback off a cultural trope about the man cave. There is social permission for men to retreat to these places, to say to children \"This place is just for Dad/Grandpa,\" etc, without having to explain and negotiate it at length.

Buying a place in a rental market will offset almost all of your costs. All you have to do is come up with 20% down. It doesn't have to be big, expensive, or fancy. In fact, if you like doing handiwork, you could steal a fixer-upper. Then dedicate every weekend to your new retirement home. Take the wife and leave the kids at the main house but DO NOT let them get the idea that this is their vacation home. It is YOUR retirement home and sanctuary from the turmoil.

Since you've already had a talk about timeline making sure that you are your wife are on the same page about making them keep to that timeline is step 1. \n\nStep 2 is setting the ground rules and bringing your children and their spouses into the picture. My mom's siblings all lived together for several years with many, many children in the house. And the only way people were able to live well together for so long was because there were ground rules everyone had to follow, someone acting as the head (in your case you and your wife) and there were regular talks to discuss \"hard issues.\" Everyone has to contribute in order for there to be \"peace\" amongst the craziness that is 5 kids. \n\nStep 3 is finding coping mechanisms for yourself. If you don't have room to build a shed or something like that, set a time that you have alone time where you're not bothered. That can be your kids taking the grandkids out or if that's not possible, making a time where the kids have to be in their room doing an activity, giving you more quiet time. And if none of that works, getting noise cancelling headphones and making your bedroom off-limits is a final plan you can implement. \n\nGood luck with this OP!

Also to the fact that they're adults, I think it's **totally** in your purview to straight-up make it transparent that this isn't your ideal situation as their father, but that you're letting them back because they are your children and because of your grandchildren. Let them know that their children need to be raised in their own homes, under their own roofs, unless they want their kids to start asking questions like \"Why doesn't Jimmy from school also live with his cousins?\".

Most of you guys wanted me to call the number Sandra was constantly texting and I honestly was about to. She came home an hour after I had posted the original post. I was almost asleep by then and I guess she thought I was asleep. She took out her phone and unlocked it. I saw her password. \n\nEventually she fell asleep and I unlocked her phone and searched the number on her phone. The number belonged to some guy named Jeff and the text messages were extremely sexual. Some examples:\n\nFrom Jeff: I loved the way you bounce when we fuck.\n\nFrom Sandra: I love it when you go down on me.\n\nThose were just 2 examples of the sexts between them, but there was a hell of a lot more. I screenshotted a ton of them and sent them to myself. \n\nAt this point, I was done with her. I confirmed that she was cheating on me. So I decide to snoop some more and looked through her photos. They were a couple of photos of her kissing and cuddling with some guy, who I assume is the same guy she's been cheating on me with. Of course I also send those photos to myself. But what threw me over the edge was a video of her (I assume one of her friends were recording this) giving some guy head. I almost lost it and woke her up to confront her, but I calmed down. Of course, I also sent the video to myself. \n\nAt this point I went for a walk for nearly 2 hours. Mind you this is the middle of the night and the area I walked through isn't the safest of areas. Still, I didn't care. I was so angry.\n\nEventually I calmed down enough and went back to our place. I slept for maybe 3 hours and woke up. I printed off some of the sexts and photos and waited for her to get up.\n\nShe finally got up at about 6AM. When she finished eating breakfast I slammed the text messages on the table. She looked at me with horror. She started crying and shaking. I took the engagement ring from our dresser and walked out. \n\nI came back a couple of hours later and she wasn't there. I called my landlord and told him we wouldn't be renewing our lease. I told her I was moving out and to never contact me again. I packed all my shit and moved in with a friend.\n\nSo yeah that's it. She was cheating on me and I'm done with her. She's been blowing up my phone begging for a 2nd chance, but she's not getting one.\n\n**tl;dr**: Sandra is a cheating bitch. She can go fuck herself.",

I mean I get _maybe_ a stupid one night stand, even if they're not brave enough to tell their partner they fucked up I can _maybe_ see why they might continue the relationship or at least try to before hopefully ending it themselves with a full fess up, but people like that who get recorded on their own phone giving some other guy head and continues a relationship with you?

I had suspected it for some time but I had gotten confirmation when I snuck and read text messages on her phone so I could prove it. The problem is that we were visiting friends in Boston and we lived in New York at the time. I didn't take it very well and I walked out of the room we were staying in into the living room where she was with her best friend and that girl's husband and I brought it up. I called her a w**** and I grab my stuff and walk down to the car and drove 4 hours back to New York moved everything out of my apartment that night and never saw her ever again. Though you might be hurting now you will feel better in time because you will realize the bullet you dodged. I actually felt an enormous sense of relief when I found those messages. Part of me did not want to be with her at all, part of me knew that the relationship was destined for failure and I was unhappy. Seeing those text messages was the confirmation I needed for myself to justify leaving. It felt really good.",

Once I saw her and showed her the pictures it was a rather satisfying feeling to shove it in her face. She obviously couldn't deny it, and basically shit herself and probably did the same thing your SO did. \n\nIve been single all summer and having the time of my life with all my old buddies. In fact I'm heading to Vegas next month! \n\nJust get through these next few weeks without doing anything stupid and you'll be fine man. She definitely is not worth it!

        "selftext": "So its been a few days and I thought I'd update my original post. https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3fkk4p/i24m_caught_my_sister26f_trying_to_steal_a_watch/\n\nI invited my mom to lunch so that we could discuss what happened at the party and where to go from there. I explained to her that my sister stole a very expensive watch from me. It wasn't just some trinket, and it shouldn't matter even if it was. I tried to pull her away and confront her in private, but she chose to yell and curse at me and cause a scene. I also told her that I understand it is never okay to look into someones private purse or bag, but that sort of etiquette goes out the window when tens of thousands of dollars of my stolen property is in her purse. \nMy mom then went on a long rant about how we are all family and that her and my sister believe that a family should share in each other's success. She tole me that my sister was just upset because I was \"hoarding\" all of my money for myself and that it's understandable what she did. She said that I would never gotten where I am today without all the work she put into raising me and the influence her and my sister had on my life. Then she went on to tell me that I \"owe\" it to her to evenly share my success with her and my sister since we are family and they would certainly do the same in my position(that's a laugh) \nAt this point I'm pretty dumbfounded. Not only because she thinks my sister's actions were somehow justified, but because she credits herself for my success and thinks it's selfish of me not to share with her and my sister. And don't even get me started on her trying to act like her and my sister would do the same. I know for a fact my sister wouldn't give me a dime if I were 10 cents shorts for a heart transplant. And my mom still owes me tens of thousands of dollars that she borrowed and swore she would pay back(I don't expect it back and wrote it off as soon as I gave it to her) \nI just can't even fathom how my mom could actually think like that. At that point I was so furious and didn't want to say anything I'd regret, so I got up and walked out. Oh yeah, I also got a text half an hour later saying that I owed her money for lunch since I was the one who invited her. Despite the fact that neither of us had even ordered before I left.\n\nAs far as my sister goes, I haven't contacted her and she hasn't contacted me. At this point I'm just done with her in my life. I don't know if I should do the same for my mother though. I would hate to not have a relationship with her, but I just can't believe how she could possibly think those things. Would love some advice on what to do as far as my relationship with my mother goes. Thanks. \n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: \nHad lunch to talk with my mom about what happened.\nShe claimed that my sister was justified in what she did because she was upset that I wasn't sharing my money with her.\nTold me that we are a family and should share in each other's success and that I am being selfish by not doing so. \nI got up and walked out\n\n\nEND OF TLDR.  I thought that putting edit/update in front of the newly added parts would make it clear, but I keep letting angry complaints about how the TLDR is so long. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Small update I thought I'd post. She called me but I didn't want to talk so I let it go to voicemail. She left a voice mail telling me to check my email. Here is her email: \"First of all, it was very rude of you to walk out on me at the cafe. I was humiliated and you should know better than to treat your mother like that. As I said in the text, you owe me money for lunch since you were the one who invited me so please bring $60 to give to me at Craig's BBQ. It is a shame that I even need to be telling you this, I know I raised you better than that. But you really need to start supporting this family. We are all one, and the success of any individual needs to be spread around the family. Your sister works as a pastry chef and is always more than happy to bake for everyone and bring us treats from work, I wish you would do the same. You can start out by helping me with the new apartment I'm moving to. The rent is $4250 per month(not including utilities) I am planning on moving in around the first of September so that gives you plenty of time to set up some sort of monthly bank transfer. I'm going to need $8500 in about 2 weeks for the first and last months rent. I'll also need you to come over a few times this month to help move my stuff over there. Bring the bigger truck, unless that's the manual because Tod doesn't know how to drive stick. As a thanks for moving my things over there I will cover the security deposit myself so you don't even need to worry about it. \nAnd you still haven't apologized to (sisters name) so please get that done this week. It will take 5 minutes tops so just get it done. It was wrong to humiliate her like that and guess you had to be the one comforting her. Me! Like usual. \nText me to confirm that you got everything and let me know how soon you can bring the big truck over.\n\nI should also mention that I currently pay for her rent. After some long guilt trip about how she gave me free food and housing for 18 years so it's time for me to repay the favor. I can clearly see now that that was a big mistake. Now she just assumes I'm going to pay her rent at some new huge place that costs twice as much and that she doesn't need? At this point I'm done giving her any support, she clearly as no appreciation for it. \n\n\nThat's just a taste of how my mom acts. She is extremely entitled and just expects everything in life to be given to her. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Another update. So I just sent my mom an email letting her know that I will not being giving her any more money.Here's the gist of it:\n\n\"I will not be paying the rent for the new more expensive apartment you want to move in. Not only will I not be paying for that, but I won't be paying your rent for any apartment anymore. You will have to do that yourself. In addition to that, I will not be giving you *any* money whatsoever. You have shown that you have no respect for me or the work it takes to earn money and I cannot continue to pay for things you don't need. I know this means cutting back a bit, but there is no reason for you to be living outside your means and I won't subsidize your expensive lifestyle.\"\nI wrote it all out completely different, but that's the gist of what I told her.\n\nSo just waiting for the freakout I'm sure is going to happen.",

My fianc\u00e9 is in a very similar boat as you--my future MIL owes him over 8k and still expects him to give and give and give, knowing full and well that there will never be any payback. I can tell you from the perspective of a SO--that shit *will not fly*. That's my family's financial future you are screwing with. Do yourself, and your future partner, a favor, and stop giving your mother handouts. Stop enabling her by lending her money.

If they want a $30,000 watch than they should go out and earn it as you did with yours. I would state that they should be thankful to you that you didn't contact the police on this matter as you would have done if it had of been anyone other than family. Also let them know that if you suspect either of them from stealing from you in the future that you *will* be involving the police and perhaps make a reference to the mandatory sentence in your state if someone is found guilty of theft of $30,000.\n\nFinally I would make it clear that as your sister has proven that she can not be trusted, that you will no longer be having a relationship with her. You will not be contacting her in any way, you will leave should she show up to a place where you are and if she comes by your apartment, you will contact the police. You mother needs to understand that this is not open for discussion and you will end any conversation with her if she brings up your sister. Finally, if you choose not to end the relationship with your mother at this time, make sure that you set very clear boundaries as well as explain what will happen if those boundaries are broken (i.e.: sever contact). Should you ever be in a position that you \"lend\" her money again, you need to consider drawing up an agreement that she has to sign dictating the terms in which the money will be paid back - if you do go this route, speak with a lawyer to ensure any agreements are legally binding.",

I can pay the bills and have a little left over for fun. My sister is a nurse and has a tough time making ends meet sometimes. She scales back on the tough months and she and her husband enjoy playing a game they call \"creative poverty\" and see how far they can get on what they have. (They have never gone hungry.) My older brother is richer than God. His custom built house in the Palisades is bigger than the hospital my sister works in (no exaggeration). Know what my sister and I do when we want something? We save up money and get it ourselves. My brother would always be there if we had an emergency, but nothing he owns belongs to us and we would be selfish and wrong to think otherwise. Sorry your family feels that level of entitlement. ",

            "OP. You are in a highly toxic situation, there is no doubt about it. \n\n(1) You have succeeded on your own accord and are entitled to keep the profits of your success. You choose to share some of that with your mother, but she needs to know that you don't have to, and that you will not be abused or walked all over. My suggestion is to inform her that $4,250 a month is a ludicrous and heinous abuse on her part, and that you will continue giving her ($X), the same amount as always, on the same time frame as always. If she wants to guilt you, shame you, disown you, etc let her. You should not suffer at her hands, I've seen this sort of thing happen in my own family and it is disgusting.\n\n(2) Your sister has acted like scum, and you indicate she would never help you (not even ten cents for a life saving procedure). My sincerest thought on the matter is to say she's dead to you. Maintaining and nurturing that relationship is impossible to do at this point, since it is more a host/virus relationship or a drug user/enabler one. Even if she pretends to clean up, makes nice for a day/week/month, it will get nasty and even worse than this. Don't be public about it, but again expect to receive nasty messages or public damnation as a result.\n\n(3) Protect your assets. Whatever you've done, double the efforts. Up your home/auto security, cover your ass with bank accounts / credit cards, make sure that they don't have your PWs or password reset answers, etc. People get vile and disgusting when they realize that you will not be abused, and they will try to bleed you out in any way possible. I'd even be wary that they might try to (stupidly) come after you legally. My point is to cover your ass in every way, and tell yourself what you would/wouldn't press charges for in case something ever occurs. \n\nIt may sound like hyperbole or stupidity to many users here for me to say this, but it is the honest truth. Cover your ass first, cover it again second, and then limit your support third.",

They ruined it. It's time to cut them off.\n\nI don't know how much you make, how cemented your financial position is... but this is a lot of money to be giving away anyhow. You would be giving away over 4000 dollars a month in rent? For the one person? Without so much as a please and thank you? The more you give them, the more they will want. The more they will treat you like a walking wallet. I would probably cut them off of my life completely after these two events, but I understand that it's easier said then done. But you really should at the very least tell your mother that non, you will not pay for lunch, and you will not pay for her apartment.

Your sister is humiliated and so poor her, she had to comfort her?  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  The whole thing is so over the top delusional, I feel like if I saw her in real life, even though she's a stranger to me, I'd have to work really hard to not start screaming at her for being such a ridiculous and horrible person.\n\nOP, your mom thinks she can get away with sending these ridiculous emails and demands because I'm positive you caved to her before and the guilt trip was probably just part of it.  Stand up for yourself and do NOT engage with your mom or sister unless they change their behavior. I'm not one of the usual types to tell everyone to just cut out their family but holy moly, you should do so ASAP.  This is not just \"extremely entitled,\" I think she has an actual psychological problem to be this delusional.",

I'm going to need $8500 in about 2 weeks for the first and last months rent. I'll also need you to come over a few times this month to help move my stuff over there. Bring the bigger truck, unless that's the manual because Tod doesn't know how to drive stick.\n\n\n\nPretty sure that's not how it works. A fucking pastry chef? What a career goal. I'm sure none of those pastries cost $12k though, no matter how good they are. \nTrying to move into a very expensive apartment she has no need for, and expects her son to foot the bill?

Make sure you watch all your finances, keep an eye out on your SSN, and possibly move your (large) saving to a new back account or one they don't know about. \n\nI'm sorry to say this but you need to file a report with the police and make sure to get a will written so that your \"*loving*\" family doesn't get shit if you pass.

No, she's chosen her future ally. She has created a strong emotional bond with her by taking her side in a situation in which her side was absurd. This will actually create a fairly strong emotional bond. Bonds based on rational action are not very strong. They are broken as easily as they are formed. Bonds based on emotion are much stronger. \n\nYour mom knows she's wrong.

After the last few days of being treated like the shit stain on the bottom of your shoes it is clear things need to change in this family if we are to remain a family.",

It will get rid of so much drama for you.",

You must have the patience of a saint.\n\nAs far as I can tell, and as I think you already know deep down, these people view you with so little respect it probably is in your best interests to cut them out. Not only do they believe it's acceptable to steal enormous sums of money from you, but that your general generosity is something they can take for granted, while having nothing but resentment for your success. How could you ever trust or look at them the same way when you know they view you as a cash cow?\n\nTheir behaviour is truly unfathomable. I'm sorry that you've been treated this way.

When my dad gave me around a substantial sum as a wedding gift in shares, all that was left of his mothers estate I offered him half, he said no, dad never did shit for us growing up so I thought, why not, split it. Real family can offer you things or accept things in the most unselfish way possible. \n\nThese people aren't family. They are assholes. \n\nCut them off. Change your number. Move. Fuck those greedy pigs out of your life. Don't ever put your hand in your pocket for them again. They would sell your organs if they thought it'd make them cash and be careful they don't take out insurance policies profiting from your death. Nothing would surprise me after they've justified earlier behaviour ",
            "Hey OP, I just wanted to say sorry you're being treated this way. Reading through your post history, you sound like such a reasonable person. I like the way you have responded to both positive and negative comments about your situation thoughtfully and seriously. I like the way you analyze and the conclusions you come to. It's a shame your mother and sister do not seem to have the ability to think critically, but it makes a lot of sense considering your evident success compared with their lack thereof. As for the people treating you negatively, they just jelly ;). I feel relatively certain your mom and sister planned to steal from you, considering the timeline and their subsequent actions. The way your mom immediately informed you of all the quickly approaching thousands of dollars of expenses she was planning to take on and have you pay immediately after your sister failed at stealing your watch... It just sounds like she panicked and had to go to plan B to make you pay. Good luck with your ensuing shitstorm, and thanks for keeping us updated. ",
            "I am very excited to see what the psychotic reply will be to the email. My mother was the exact same way. Constant guilt trips for the things you're SUPPOSED to do for your child. It's bullshit. You'll be much better off without family like that",
            ">After some long guilt trip about how she gave me free food and housing for 18 years so it's time for me to repay the favor.\n\nMy mom tries to pull a similar guilt trip, and it worked for a while until I had kids. Then my perspective changed. \n\nProviding things for you until you were 18 was  her ***responsibility because of the choices she made***. You didn't ask to be born, she had you. As such, she's responsible for your well being. Living up to basic responsibilities isn't something that should be rewarded exactly. Plus it seems like if you actually calculated how much she spent on you, you're very likely even at the least. When she freaks out about your last statement, if you want to put down that argument just put together a list of her expenses on you, and what you've given her so far.\n\nSo yeah, don't feel bad that she demands to be paid back for services she was required to provide, and that you didn't ask for.

            "Are you Latino? I only ask because my family is Dominican, and my mother *would react in the exact same way.* \n\nI had an issue with my grandmother (my mom's mom) for *years* where she would steal my stuff and send it off to the Dominican Republic, to some of my poorer cousins (so that they could wear or sell them). I found out when I got sick of some of my favorite dresses, shoes, etc. going missing, and finding them hidden in her room, in a large crate where she periodically sends things to DR. When I confronted my mother about it, she got angry that I was being so greedy and selfish, since they were just material items anyway!\n\nI'm not saying that Latinos are thieves. I despise stereotypes of all kinds and especially about my people. However, my mom, like yours, did justify my grandmother stealing from me by saying that since we're family, we should \n\n1. Forgive nearly everything we do to one another\n2. Share our wealth in all forms.\n\nMy mom is also constantly worried about propriety and public image and \"keeping things in the family\" and blah blah blah. Just reading your post, I could've sworn that I had wrote it myself.",
            "Good lord, what kind of mother tries to leech money off her own child like this? It's absolutely disgusting the way she thinks in regards to your money OP. You sister was not justified in trying to steal your watch, your mother was not justified in defending her, and her behavior following the cafe incident speaks volumes about how much she values you for your money alone.\n\nI admit, I started to get a little justice boner when I read the text you sent to her in that e-mail at the end. Now the ball is in her court, and it's up to her whether or not she takes this as a life lesson,  or tries to shift the blame back onto you over some stupid reason or another. \n\nIf your mom or sister continue to try and use you for money, I would say just distance yourself from the both of them altogether. They may be relatives, but you don't have to continue to treat them like family if they don't treat you the same way. ",
            "You should have sent that email at the bottom of your post. The \"gist\" is perfect!  Good luck and congrats for cutting the cancer from your life. Hopefully your mother's attitude and treatment changes and you can welcome your mother back, without the crap and expense. ",

            "Late to this, and I'm guessing it will never been seen, but it strikes me that everyone here, you, your mom or your sister have kind of a strange attitude towards money. Did you suddenly come into a lot of money, or something? The way your mother and sister are acting, it's like they don't think you deserve or earned your money, and therefore you may as well give it to them. It actually reminds me a lot of my ex's family. He went from being a regular, middle class guy to suddenly being veery wealthy due to an unexpected signing bonus. They were constantly at his door, needing \"just a little help\" when their cars were suddenly too old to drive or whatever. Like you he paid his mom's rent (or actually, bought her house but close enough) and had a fractious relationship with his siblings. \n\nTo his credit he managed to turn it around, and he and his mother get along much better now. One thing that came out when they were working through it was how much his mother felt he was flaunting his wealth, and rubbing it in everyone's face. He wasn't, and jealousy is toxic, but he also made an effort to be more sensitive to their feelings. They felt judged, for being less wealthy than him and his \"fancy\" new friends, while he felt pressured to be everyone's ATM. Without getting to specific, he helped set her up with a business that she has been successful with. She works for her money, helps the cousins etc. but now being on the ATM side herself understands him a lot better. \n\nTL;DR Your mom is being a jerk, having boundaries are good and getting to the root of her entitlement might help solve this in the future, if you even want to.  ",
            "If everything you're saying is true: your mom's an idiot (narcissist at the very least). It would probably explain your sister's behaviour, too. Just leave. It's not worth the headache. Family is supposed to be there in a loving relationship, not a debtor's relationship. ",
            "I posted on your first thread, on this I just want to add that one of my uncle's if reminds me of your mother, he is manipulative, acts as a victim, and blames his sons ( my cousins) if they not help pay for his everything.\nLet me point out this guy used to eat a prime rib type of steak daily as we grew up, while his kids only ate a bare minimal meal.  \nYou can't choose who your parents are and maybe you can't cut them or of your life, but you are the owner your life and need to live it yourself and move on. Imo you are doing the right thing in cutting all ties. They can fend for thenselfs they will eventually find another person to leech off of.   \nEdit:  again this is my opinion, you don't need to listen to what I just wrote. And I dint man to offend.  \nEdit: like you asked he is alive that's all we really knew... BUT ironically my dad was the only one in the family that ever called out on my uncle about how bad he was and no one ever beloved him... Only now after 20ish years did the whole family realized how shitty he was....\nEdit: by if you move on some of your family will realize is not you it's them, and some might just be too blind to see the truth, but eventually when they get screwed over by one of them they will realize. So you will be fine",
            "Je.  Sus.  Christ.\n\nNobody likes hearing this about their own family, but your mom is a leech, plain and simple.  Its now abundantly clear where your sister got her sense of entitlement from.  \n\nYou have to cut them off, and I mean completley.  These people are literally dragging you down.  Your mom says family should care for each other, but stealing your 30k watch or demanding $60 for dinner when you pay > $1000 a month for her rent are both examples of them not caring for you or your hard work in the slightest.\n\nIt's rough, I know, but you absolutely have to cut them out of your life.  These are the kind of people who will take all they can for as long as they can until they've bled you dry.  Then, when the money is gone, they'll forget you exist because you no longer have something they want.\n\nYou need to look out for your best interests, because it's obvious nobody else is going to.  \n\nAnd on that note, for the love of god, have a lawyer draft up an airtight will.  I don't know if you are married, but regardless, the last thing you need is your mom or sister realizing that they could theoretically take control of your estate if something were to happen to you.",
            "I don't think there's anything wrong with supporting your mother, she did care for you for many years, however this is no way to ask for help. It's very selfish of her to act this way and all that entitlement..sheesh!...",

You feed, clothe, and shelter your kids BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PARENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. You don't do it in the hopes that you can sponge off them one day. Good on you for standing your ground throughout all of this. You sound like you are much better off without your mom and sister.",
