Thank you all for your comments, you talked me into doing it and I\u2019m so glad I did. I made a little \"coffee?\u201d sign as a few of you suggested and held it up after our morning wave yesterday. I didn\u2019t put anything else on the paper because I didn\u2019t want to look like a keener but we managed to set something up pretty easily. \n\n\nAnyways it went really well. There were just a couple things that I'm not sure about. He's suuuuuper good looking in person, he's really tall and fit and he looks so good in his uniform. We hit it off pretty well. We had coffee and lunch yesterday and we are going for lunch again today, and we've been texting a lot too. When we were walking back after lunch we walked past one of his coworkers who was like \u201chey its you!\u201d and I guess they were also telling him to contact me. He told me his Christmas sign was meant for me and when I didn\u2019t make a sign back he just figured I wasn\u2019t interested in talking to him but I only didn\u2019t make one back since I didn\u2019t know for sure it was for me. \n\n\nOne of the things I wasn't sure about is his age, he's 8 years older than me. I don't think it's necessarily a deal breaker but I've never dated someone that much older because they usually want to get married and settle down right away. That brings me to the second thing, he's technically married and is in the process of divorcing and it will be finalized in a few months. Not sure how to feel about that one\u2026 he said he is very happy about it but I have to wonder what the cause for the divorce is, but that\u2019s not something I should just come out and ask though right? Also this is stupid but he\u2019s one of those guys who sits with his legs waaaaay apart and I\u2019ve always thought people who do that are assholes but maybe he is an exception to that rule! He offered to come get me when my car broke down yesterday so I know he's a good guy. \n\n\nEither way he seems like a lot of fun and I\u2019m glad I finally had the courage to reach out. Thanks reddit!\n\n\n**tl;dr**: we met up and he seems like a really cool guy. ",

            "25 and 33?  That's not unreasonable, by the formula the lower range for 33 is 23ish so you're definitely in an age gap but it isn't unworkable. \n\nThe wanting-marriage thing you'll have to decide for yourself. See how it goes before you make to much judgement. He's just getting out of a marriage. He may want nothing to do with it for a while. \n\nAnd on that note, I wouldn't make judgements based on his divorce. Lots of people get divorced for lots of reasons. And if he's getting divorced I really wouldn't consider it cheating for him to be starting to keep his options open. Emotionally he's made the choice to start leaving that relationship. Do be aware of rebound. \n\nBut, if he's now getting divorced, was he married when he was window-flirtingish? Just things to keep in mind. It's not really damning imo, just another element to be aware of. \n\nI'm glad you guys met and it seems to have gone well :)",
            "Perhaps it would be best that you stick to coffee, lunch, friendly things while his divorce is being processed. You can get to know him better and ask about his divorce before you decide anything.\n\nAs for the age gap, the older you get the less it matters. If he is just getting divorced he likely isn't in a huge rush to remarry right?\n\nIt's super cute that his coworkers knew he was waving at the cute girl in the next building, and I think that says something about him as a person. \n\nI'm very glad your coffee sign worked!",
            "I really just want to say that tall guys often sit like this because anything else is uncomfortable. Next time you have the chance, sit down in a chair meant for children and notice where your legs end up. ",
            "Things to consider are of course the age gap, but at 25 and working you're both at the same phase in life; the divorce could be tricky if there's kids, but if not it might not be a big deal; he's at the 'settling down age', I guess, but if he's just out of a marriage then he'll probably want to take it slow.\n\nYou've only just met him, so if you wanna take it slow, then that's what you should do! No need to worry too much just now, if he seems so nice!",
            "I'd get confirmation for that divorce before I invested too deeply, OP.  Stories about a troubled marriage on its last legs are classic cover for affairs.   A lot of guys can get enthusiastic about a new flame but not have the guts to end a bad thing.   You could be wading into a mess. \n\nAdd him on Facebook, see if he's skittish about bringing you around his place. ",

            "This is cute. A total chick flick in the making.",
            "That age difference shouldn't be an issue with 25 and 33. It's when it's, say, 17 and 25 that there is a power differential created by the age difference.  Also in your case the circumstances just aren't there that would cause people like me to give him the side-eye. He didn't go out looking for a younger woman. \nHappy for you that you made this move and hope things work out for you.",
            "Just take it slow. Age gaps can be bad because of power dynamic and being in different stages of life. It doesn't really sound like that's a problem with a mid 20s and early 30s gap. Don't assume he's looking for something serious already, just go with the flow.\n\nI'd also keep an eye peeled to make sure he's *actually* separated and in the process of divorce.\n\nOut of curiosity, what'd he do when he saw the sign? Did he sign back? Sounds cute.",
            "For what it's worth, I'm 26 and my boyfriend is 32 and honestly I hardly ever notice the age difference, except when we bring up pop culture from our childhoods, LOL. I think the key in age difference relationships is 1) if there is an accompanying power differential, and 2) if the 2 people are in the same or different stages of life.\n\nYou're both clearly in the same stage of life (working, adults) and there's no clear power differential due to age or status. I don't think the age difference will be an issue. \n\nAs for the divorce thing - I understand why this might be something you're worried about, but I don't think it's worth writing this guy off immediately. Marriages end for a lot of reasons, and oftentimes they don't end because the people in them are bad people, they end because they realize they aren't compatible or aren't happy anymore. \n\nBesides, just because you met up with him doesn't mean you're going to marry him or even be in a relationship with him! Just take things as they come and spend this time getting to know him without worrying about whether or not you're going to date him forever and ever. If the divorce is an issue worth worrying about, it will become clear as more time passes. \n\nThis is a wonderful update! Good luck, and I hope things work out.",
            "Two things-  \n1-  25 and 33?  That's no big deal.  As a matter of fact, that's your ballpark, now.\n\n2-  Verify the whole divorce deal.  That may be a lot more trouble than it's worth.  \n",
            "I would stick to coffee until his divorce is final.Other than that I wouldn't worry too much. Hope it ends up great!",
            "CONGRATS!!! The age difference isn't that bad at all.  If he's divorcing, it's likely he's not going to want to rush into another marriage that fast.  It's just coffee.  Do lunch and another coffee.  Keep it in real time, don't think too much about the 'what if's' about the future or worry about anything that hasn't happened yet. ",

            "The timeline for the divorce is funny.  You're worried about dating a guy going through one, he didn't have a problem writing a christmas thing for you 5 months ago.  Kinda odd, but who knows how long/contentious the divorce is.  Just something to keep in mind.",
            "Regarding the age and divorce thing, I met my boyfriend when I was 32 and he was 24.  I was technically still married and waiting for the divorce papers to finalize. Shouldn't be an issue unless the divorce is more complicated with kids, house, etc. \n\nNot sure about your guy, but I certainly wanted to take it slow after the divorce.  Still together two years later, so give it a go OP. ",
            "Wait, wait, wait...backup... How exactly did the sign thing go down? That was the whole dilemma from your first post and all you give us is that you held up a coffee sign?? What happened after that? Did he hold up a sign with his ph# or what? Don't leave us hanging.          \n          \n8 years isn't a deal breaker but please be aware of red flags. Sounds like you already are so that's good. The fact he told you upfront about the marriage thing is a good sign too (\"sign\" heh heh). I'd want to know if he still lives with her. If he does then I'd say back off for now. No reason that you have to rush things. If they are separated and living apart then it sounds fine. My ex and I didn't get divorced for about 8 months because it wasn't a priority and I was the one that had to pay the money to file for it. It was a few hundred dollars if I recall. But we were way over and not living together even though we weren't divorced.         \n        \nIf he sits on the subway, for example, with his legs far apart and takes up other people's personal space then yes, that's being an asshole. If he's doing it because he's tall and it's comfortable to sit like that and he's not invading other's personal space then whatever.       \n        \nSo cool to read this update! I didn't post on your first one because everyone had already given you great suggestions but I was curious to know what happened! Hope it works out for the best!",
            "> He offered to come get me when my car broke down yesterday so I know he's a good guy. \n\nDon't be so quick to judge a person. He is interested in you of course he would come and help. I don't know if he is good or not, but don't pass judgement so quickly.",
            "Doubt he will be rushing to get married if he is in the process of a divorce. I would maybe keep things a little more casual or friendly until you can find out more details. Your age difference is not that bad. But he didn't say if he had any kids with soon to be ex...",

            "Yay! I've been hoping you would update. I'm 8 years older than my SO & it's worked out great. In your comments you said he doesn't seem to want to take things too slowly. Just remember - you are in charge of what makes you comfortable. Take things slow, get to know him, if anything, you found a friend in the next building.",

I'm 28, so I'm 5 years younger than him.\n\nI have been with my boyfriend since January but not official/exclusive until March.  I kind of waited until he offered some information and after a bit of getting to know each other, he was fairly open with the reasons.  Over time he's shared a little more with me.\n\nEventually I do think you need to know, but not immediately.\n\nI think mid-divorce should be a flag of concern (yellow flag maybe?).  It's not necessarily indicative of a guy not ready to date, but it might be.",
            "Well, when I was separated from my wife and going through with the divorce, but before it was final, I met a girl who was 8 years younger than me. We dated for a year, during which time the divorce became final.  Though we didn't last, the relationship was amazing and didn't end for any reasons related to age or marriage. So, don't let things like that cloud your judgment.  If you want to keep seeing him, then that's all you need to know.",

            "OP, thanks so much for the update! I was really hoping you'd fill us in on what happened!!  This was one of most interesting r/relationships posts I've read in a while.\n\nI'm glad you took a chance on initiating that contact (overcoming that he'd thought you had written him off).\n\nI think age gaps and previous marriages are things that are dependent up the very specific context of each person/relationship. Not all 5+ year age gap relationships involve a controlling, abusive older person and not all divorces are the result of flagrant infidelity/serial cheating. \n\nAs a a 6'01\" guy, I'd concur with other posters the legs spread apart stance is quite typical of tall people. It can be bad for back posture, but sometimes it's the only way to stay comfortable seated in a cubicle for long periods of time!\n\nHope everything goes great for you! Take things at whatever pace you're both comfortable with!",
            "Honestly, try not to focus too much on all that stuff. You're only going on your second date! If these things are issues, they will manifest over time.

Like others have said, it's not huge and would diminish in the future. \n\nI think it's a good sign he told you about his divorce status. It's not a reason to back away, just to be cautious.

I think it will be alright age-wise, because in the end, it's just how you feel about each other and not how old you are. And I (personally) don't feel like it's that much older, as long as he is respectful of you and your boundaries (but any aged person should do that!) I feel like you shouldn't \"fall in love\" with him (if it even goes that far) until he is fully divorced.

Their lives are in a LOT of flux, especially if there's kids, money, possessions, bad feelings, etc. They may think they're ready, they may swear up and down they're ready, but in some cases they just are not ready or in a good headspace.

It's not a big deal.\n\nI would be hesitant on the marriage point though. On the one hand, my best friend started dating her current long-term partner while she was still married and separated, and they couldn't be happier. However, there are plenty of guys who *say* they are getting divorced/are going to break up/whatever so that they can date someone on the side while staying comfortably married. If you don't know him very well, I might wait on dating him or see if he can get someone to back him up, since you don't know whether you can trust him that much yet.",

At 25 and 33, he's not grooming you for sexual abuse I'm pretty sure. Still keep and eye out though.\n\nAs for the leg thing, I'd just gently bring it up and maybe show him a few articles about it if it REALLY bothers you, but I wouldn't do that right now. Wait a few months and see if it continues to bug you. If you end up on a crowded subway/bus with him and he's doing it, politely ask him to make a little room - both for your and the other passengers' sakes. \n\nGood luck, & congrats!

            "The cool thing about getting to know someone is that you get to know them.\n\nAbsolutely nothing wrong with asking direct questions and describing what you are looking for.\n\nHis divorce is convenient, because you can use it as a way to keep him at arm's length until you decide whether or not you are compatible. \n\nBe careful not to project your expectations upon him. You'll give yourself tons of anxiety over things that could turn out to be just fine. And, guys will always do something that is a little off. You just have to weigh it against the good qualities and remember that you might have a trait that seems odd to him, as well.",
            "I've been divorced. Most women I've dated seriously generally ask about it. I'm a pretty open guy so it's not an issue and I understand how that question would be important to them. I think it's a reasonable thing to ask especially since it sounds like he's been flirting with you for awhile.",
            "8 years older isn't that big a deal at 25. He isn't necessarily wanting to get married right away, don't overthink it. If he's technically married and getting divorced, just keep it casual for a while until the deal is sealed, don't get too involved. Wait until it all blows over and just keep it very very casual and fun.\n\nGuys who sit with their legs way apart aren't necessarily assholes. If I put my legs together it hurts my back severely because I have lower back problems. Sometimes there's a good explanation.\n\nJust take your time and get to know him slowly.",
            "Wait for a few more dates before you ask why they are divorcing.\n\n8 years older than 25 is not bad. A gap like that will seem less and less consequential with each year anyway.\n\nYou are concerned that he is really attractive...he obviously thinks you are cute though, I mean, he has been telling his coworker about you! I wouldn't worry. People tend to date within their own attractiveness level anyway. You want to know how cute you are? Look at who you attract.\n\nAlso, do not assume that because he in in his early 30s that he wants to settle down soon. Plus, settle down means different things to different people. I am in my early 30s and there were guys that assumed I would get baby rabies? I have never had the desire for babies. My point is, it is really important your goals match up, but you can't assume to know what their goals are, you have to figure that out from them.\n\nHave FUN OP. This is an adorable story and now you two cuties can go on a few dates and see what happens!",
            "Do please check his story on the divorce through public records. A friendly coworker isn't enough. You'd be amazed at the stories I've heard / lived insofar as how far their friends and coworkers may go to look out for each other. \n\nBesides that, enjoy :)",

            "25 and 33 isn't necessarily a dealbreaker, but there's a bigger gap in life experience if he's been married and you haven't, so that's something that widens the gap between you guys a little, even though the chronological age difference is larger. That said, \"technically married\" is a HUGE red flag for me. I've known more than one person (male and female) who've casually misrepresented the status of a supposedly \"almost over\" marriage to a potential partner. I recommend moving REALLY slowly in any romantic context until you have a better idea of when his marriage will be officially over. Focus on building a friendship before rushing into anything else. Good luck!",
            "Don't discount any of this!!\n\nI met my current boyfriend in a situation not entirely unlike yours; he's a bartender, and last summer a few friends and I happened in the bar he works at. We only exchanged a handful of words but I thought he was really cute and something must have been drawing me to him, because I left my number for him on the back of my receipt when we left. He texted that night, and we've talked daily since (9 months ago). \n\nAs far as age goes, we're five years apart (me late 20's, him early 30's), and if anything I find it perfect since men generally mature at a later age than women, and I've always been more mature for my age due to the way I grew up. Also, if this guy is just getting out of a relationship/divorce, he's going to be in no rush to get married again any time soon. One of my favorite quotes on relationships comes from a John Steinbeck letter to his son, something I remind myself of often: \"And don\u2019t worry about losing. If it is right, it happens\u2014The main thing is not to hurry. Nothing good gets away.\"\n\nBest of luck!",

            "When I was 26, I met my now-husband. He was 35 at the time. I was nervous about the age gap too, but honestly? The only time we even notice it is when we're talking about childhood memories (or when I'm teasing him for being an old man). Don't let it stand in your way! We're wonderfully happy now and I wouldn't trade my husband for the world, even if he is coming up on 40 and I'm not even 30 yet :)",

But I AM saying that even the worst of the worst guys (I'm talking rapists, child molestors, wife-beaters) pull out all kinds of gestures like this in the beginning. In fact a lot of the Worst of the Worst guys even go overboard in doing such things in the beginning, pulling out all the stops way more than an average guy, to get you hooked and also confuse you when they start to act like their true self, later. \n\nIf he's still doing this two years in, you can point to it as evidence of him being a good guy. NOT when he's doing it right up front, it's a nice gesture but it doesn't mean you know his character yet. \n\nAbout the divorce, I doubt you will listen, but I recommend you wait until the divorce is finalized before you start dating. After all, if it'll really be over SOO soon, then it's not a long wait. Right?\n\nThis prevents you from wasting time. ",

We've been together for 20 years, married for 16, and now have 4 kids, 3 cats, and 2 dogs. We still act like we're 20 year olds in love - so much so that our youngest (17 year old girl) regularly facepalms herself after catching my wife and I giggling and teasing each other.

They met at 24 and 32, when he was going through a divorce after 8 years of marriage. They dated, married three years later (since he's going through a divorce you probably don't need to worry about any race to the aisle), and they just celebrated their 28th wedding anniversary in St Martin. If it's going well, give it a chance! ",
            "Good for you. I wouldn't be too worried about the age gap because you're both in a similar phase of your lives.\n\nI would advise taking it slowly until his divorce is finalized. I'm sure that the reason for it will come up naturally.\n\nGood luck in your relationship.",
            "Sounds like you're getting waaaay ahead of yourself. Go out a few times and see if you even like him. If things proceed in a good way then maybe start asking those personal questions.

I once dated a guy who was divorced, then he was separated, then he was sleeping on the couch, and then it became clear that I was the other woman. Each stage took a week or two and it's not an uncommon series of lies. The fact that his coworkers are aware, though, is a good sign!\n\nCongratulations on taking a successful risk! Good luck going forward! :)",

You guys were an amazing source of support in a tough situation. I never expected this to get more than a few comments, and the sheer amount of feedback has just been shocking. Again, thank you all.\n\nOne thing I'd like to expand on- A few people have wondered how Cara's parents were oblivious to the behavior. As far as facebook goes, Cara had two. She had her parents on a \"normal\" facebook that had a small friends list of relatives and a few distant people from high school. Her main facebook had her japanese name (which she never mentioned to them she had changed) and her main group of friends.\n\nSecondly, her interactions with her parents were short. She kept to herself and stays in her room often when at home. She told them she wanted to broaden her horizons and told them working as a translator would provide a great opportunity for that. They have paid for her trips to Japan under the impression that she was going there to scope out the work scene and to make connections. \n\nShe was careful to keep her home and social lives very separate and her parents never really had a reason to question their daughter about it.\n\n**So this is what went down after my previous update.**\n\nAfter the talk with Cara's parents, I went home and fully expected her to call, message, or even show up at my door. She never did. But, she removed her facebook profile which had her Japanese name, and a lot of information that supported her fake persona. She also deleted her tumblr, which also followed the same vein as her facebook. Everything was quiet for a good two days, and I chalked it up to her being embarassed about the situation and not wanting to talk to anyone about it.\n\nHer mom called me yesterday to wish me a Happy New Year and to let me know what was going on. Basically, this is what happened:\n\nCara got home from her ski trip and her parents were waiting in the living room with print outs from her blog, fb, etc. They confronted her immediately about the profiles and the information posted on there. She tried to tell them that it was for her career in Japan and that the Japanese would be more likely to hire something with Japanese heritage. They didn't buy it and she flipped out. She began to demand to know who showed them her blog/facebook. Now, her mom *said* they didn't tell her, but Im guessing they probably did because she knows its me. Its ok, I sort of expected them to tell her since they are her parents. \n\nAnyway, she had begun to cry by this point and it was hard to get any answers out of her. Her parents basically laid out everything I had shown and told them, esp the part about her dad being her step-dad. They told her they could forgive some eccentric behavior, but not full on disrespect of her parents, nor the needless lying that was going on. They told her she had two options- come down to reality or leave. She has no job, and lives at home for free. Everything is funded by her parents, including expensive trips to Japan. \n\nShe chose to stay. One of the conditions was that she had to remove social media accounts that continued to tie her to the lies. So her Japanese facebook was removed and her tumblr as well. She also had to agree to therapy. Her mom told me they were in the process of finding someone for her to see, preferably every week, so they could get to the root of the problem and begin to break the cycle of consistent lying. They are keeping an eye on her now, mostly because they are afraid she will lash out or do something rash, but honestly I think she isn't going to do anything. She is most likely really really embarrassed that she was outed and just wants everyone to forget it. I don't know how shes going to manage it, because shes going to either have to tell all her current friends the truth, or ditch them altogether.\n\nSo I wished her mom the best and we hung up. I thought that was that, but a few hours later, I get a call from an unknown number. I pick up, its her. She told me she hated me and she couldn't believe I'd do this to her. She called me a whole book of names and said she hoped someone would ruin my life as much as I'd ruined hers. Then she told me to never contact her again and to keep her name out of my mouth. I just said ok and hung up. I knew our friendship was at an end before all of this, but I cant pretend it wasn't uncomfortable to hear how bitter and angry she was towards me.\n\n\nSo that's it. I guess I got what I wanted out of the situation, which was for her to be faced with reality. I can only hope that therapy will help her to reconnect with her real life and to figure out whats going on underneath that whole web of lies shes spun for herself. Yes, it sucks that things had to end how they did, but i dont regret telling her parents and potentially saving her from colossally fucking up her life. \n\nAgain, thank you to everyone whos offered their support and advice. I didnt have anyone solid to talk to about this issue and if it hadnt been for the encouragement of many people on here, I probably would have just backed out. I hope 2015 brings you all great things.\n\n\n\n---   \n**tl;dr**: Her parents confronted her about the lying and gave her an ultimatum. She chose to continue living at home and had to remove the offending online accounts as well as agree to therapy. Called to tell me she hates me and never wants to speak to me again. ",

You called her parents so they can go pick her up and she's mad at you because she was enjoying the scenery? I don't know, this analogy's going off the rails a little bit. \n\nBut the point is, she needed a reality check. *Badly*. And honestly, the only people who can and should handle something of this magnitude were her parents. And you were the one who showed them how far off into the wilderness their daughter was. And they should be very grateful to you, as should your friend, one day. \n\nHer situation was completely untenable, and would have come crashing down on her one way or another. This way it's a controlled demolition instead of an uncontrolled collapse. She's mad at you because she had to build such a huge fortress of deception and lies in order to live in her fantasy world, and now it's torn down. She did that to herself, by lying to everyone around her. One day I hope she will realize what a mistake she had made and appreciate what you did for her. But I wouldn't hold your breath. Just move on with your life and be satisfied that you did the right thing. \n\nGood luck, and happy new year!",

We sadly use the word \"weirdo\" to describe a lot of people like this, but you exposed it for what it was - illness.

At first I was a bit surprised that you went to her parents, as I probably would have called an intervention with her friends (at 26, I would assume her peers would have been more influential than her parents), but considering she still lives with her parents and on their dime, you probably made the better call.\n\nHonestly, the best person to help her, more than a therapist, I think, would be for her to meet a \"socialized nerd,\" someone who shares her interests but not her delusions and is patient enough to put up with her and call her out on her shit.

            "I've been looking into this thread and there are a lot of \"but why do so many people choose Japan\" over their own culture or any other culture. As an average white guy from an English-American atheist family who has almost always been pretty obsessed with Jewish/Hebrew/Yiddish culture just maybe not to weeaboo (Jew-aboo?) levels, I'm going to take a stab at the whole Japan thing. I know next to nothing about Japan that I haven't heard from my Japanophile ex girlfriend, so bear with me and I apologize if I say something racist or inaccurate.\n\n\n\nAmerican culture is flat out *obsessed* with the archetype of the foul-mouthed, uneducated swaggering ape-man who doesn't play by the rules, doesn't care about his family or his nation (unless it's about his perceived rights), and can be counted on to drone on about \"muh guns, muh free market, muh liberty\" and \"gettin' pussy\". You will find your niche groups of people who don't like that, but no matter where you move in the states, you'll find that the 'ideal man' that most people strive to be is someone with a \"fuck my community, what about muh freedoms?\" attitude. I think a good example of a guy like this is Han Solo, or Jack Sparrow, or any of the guys you see driving around in giant pickups with \"WWJD\" stickers on the bumper. I can tell you exactly what Jesus wouldn't do, he wouldn't drive that truck and he sure as hell wouldn't throw his community under the bus for the sake of owning a firearm. \n\n\nWhen I went to college I found American Jewish culture to be most intriguing, particularly the focus on education and the idea that being a man has more to do with being there for your family and your people than it has to do with having a big dick, owning guns, and fathering a lot of kids you don't intend to raise. Similarly, the idea that education and being a scholar is something inherently masculine and not something attributed to \"book learnin' nerds and femboys\". Many people in my high school graduating class, including several of my good friends, dropped out of high school because they wanted to prove they were real men who work with their hands.                               \n\n\nFrom what my Japanophile friends have told me, Japanese culture has everything I appreciate about American Jewish culture, in that it's a culture that forces you to put your people and your tribe before yourself, and that bettering yourself should really be about bettering your community, not \"getting ahead of the pack\". \n\n\nThat's just my two cents.

            "I'm glad you told them, you can tell how much they really appreciate it. Her lying generates a whole hoard of issues, no matter what the subject. Lying to me is considered one of the worst things you can do to another person, because it means they don't respect you enough to tell you what's really going on AND they think you're a moron to believe what lie they give.\n\n> she told me to never contact her again and to keep her name out of my mouth.\n\nI've only heard this come out of the most gossipy bitches ever.\n\nBut jeez, I wish I had supportive parents to live under for free and get Japan trips, hot damn. I wouldn't create some creepy heritage alter ego and lie to them in return though. d:\n\nThe therapy will do her GOOD. Lots of good.

            "Crazy people do crazy things. Just keep that in mind. It took me almost 6 months to get rid of a crazy ex-friend once. She popped my bike tired, broke into my place, scratched my car, started rumors about me and had friends suspecting I was the crazy one. After about 6 months she kind of realized I wasn't reacting to her BS and targeted her madness elsewhere. Then people from my old friend group, who she still hung with, came to me to commiserate about her insane dramatic BS and tell me all the new crap she'd pulled on others after I left. \n\nJust making a point.

Maybe after a few years and lots of therapy you could be around her again if you so choose, but frankly I'm just glad that you did what you did.\n\nNo matter what she calls you, you were her friend to the end.",
            "I am very sorry for your loss, but years later this could be a blessing in disguise. ",
            "Wow, that is a weird situation but you did the right thing. I'm sure it was difficult to hear that backlash from someone you have been friends with for a long time and were trying to help. Remember that she could have chosen to keep up the ruse by moving out, but she chose to give it up and face the reality of who she is so she could continue not facing the reality of being not far from 30 and not being responsible for herself. \n\nObviously she needs to grow up and I've always believed we should not humor the delusional. Sorry you had to bear the brunt of it but it will be for the best in the long run.",
            "I'm not trying to be critical, but I just want to know; who was she hurting with the whole 'trying to be Japanese' thing? She is an adult (although seems quite childish) and why not just let her live in her fantasy world while you remove her from your life?  Again, I don't want to sound critical or anything, just want to understand the rationale behind telling her parents.",
            "You did the right thing.  She's just lashing out at you, even though she knows you were in the wrong.  Keep an occasional eye on the situation, make sure she isn't retaliating some way, and just focus on you OP",

            "You did a tremendous service to your friend. Honestly if she doesn't realise sooner or later what you've done for her it's her loss. I'd be so grateful to have an honest friend like yourself if I was in her position",
            "Thanks for the final update. I had been following this story mostly because I had a somewhat similar experience with a close high school friend and ultimately had to call her parents about it because her obsession and delusion got to levels that made her reference suicide. WIth my friend, it still took many,many years for her to recover from her fantasy life and we drifted apart. She did eventually marry and have a child so I can only assume things worked out for her.\n\nGood for you for having this kind of courage. And one day, whether she tells you or not, she will be thankful someone intervened before things got really, really out of hand. ",
            "The problem is that she blames you for removing her obsession. Hopefully, her new obsession won't be exacting revenge on you. You see how far she'll go when she fixates on something. Be careful.",

It boggles my mind that someone at 26 could build such a fake world for themselves.  Sad to think she sank most of her 20s into a delusional life, but hopefully she can catch up quickly.\n\nTotally different situation, but it reminds me of when I used to date a girl that made up a huge, fake backstory from her hometown about being a connected, underworld gang boss (at 14, mind you) and told everyone about it.  She was definitely a compulsive liar and had no problems just making something up on the spot, often the bigger and more shocking the lie, the more likely she would be to try to spread it.",

IIRC, there's Koreans who live there for generations without getting Japanese citizenship. They will never be Japanese. (Korea is similar - Korean babies in Japan will have Korean citizenship, by right of blood).\n\nSo she's trying to fit in, with a false social media profile, so she can pretend to be a real person in Japan.\n\nI'm not sure what her goal is.

You seem to know more than you should.\n\nI'm really offended by you saying \"I got what I wanted out of this situation\". Congrats man. You are now avenged while 3 people are pretty upset. I think it shows what this really was about here. It wasn't about helping Cara, it was about you going through hoops to prove a point.\n\nI don't think you should have gotten involved and I honestly think in the long run, you are probably just going to further some of her issues. I'm trying to think like Cara here, and if I were Cara, I'd probably have to create a third persona. I'd also be even more private and really wouldn't trust any friends/family. What do you think Cara is going to do, considering we know she isn't all there?\n\nI'll try to keep my notes limited here:\n\n- Cara is an adult. She's a freeloading adult, but she's an adult. If she wants to lie, that's her business. You can call her out on it or choose not to associate with her in real life, but posting about it on the internet THREE TIMES, tells me there's some other factors involved.\n\n- Cara obviously has some long-term issues going on here that neither you or me know about. We don't really know what happened in that house and we never will. \n\n- You should really stay out of situations that aren't causing direct harm to anyone. Unless someone is going to get physically hurt or get in legal trouble, stay out of it.\n\n- I think you should consider that the human brain is a weird thing and it's common for people to have memories of things that never happened. You see it all the time in stuff with nostalgia where people remember toys and shows being things they weren't. There's definitely some of that here. Likely, with Cara's exposure to Japanese stuff and anime showing real places in Japan, it's easy to see why that would happen. You should also consider dreams as I'll have dreams that seem very realistic, and often I have to say to myself, oh yeah, that was a dream, not reality.\n\nI don't think anyone was really in the right here and I don't think things are going to be automatically better, but I'm glad you were able to \"get what you wanted\".

        "selftext": "Hello Reddit. I am the guy who submitted this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2s03z7/my_wife_33f_and_i_36m_have_been_asked_by_my_wifes/\n\nAnd I know I promised an update so I'm going to give a quick one before going to bed.\n\nI told my wife I desperately needed some time to myself so she was a complete sweetheart and watched the kids for me while I went to my favorite coffee shop and for the first four hours did nothing but drink Cappucinno's and read.\n\nI then started to think about what to do about the problem with my nieces. It suddenly occured to me that even though they had deadbeat fathers, perhaps the paternal side of thier family coud be of assistance.\n\nThat night I got home after my wife had put all the kids to bed and told her we needed to talk.\n\nI completely lost it and broke down sobbing. I told her I could not take her nieces. I told her how stressed I was with work, how exhausted I felt every single day doing nothing but working and being a dad. I told her she was a good wife and mom and I appreciated her having a part time job and taking care of the kids when I was at work but I was starting to resent how I had to pick up her slack and cook and clean because she wouldn't do it. I told her I was considering committing suicide because I just couldn't handle the pressure of having to fix her sister's mistakes and that I already felt like a failure as a husband and father and was sick of life.\n\nMy wife was white as a ghost. And she didn't argue or get defensive. Not once. She just gave me a big hug and started crying too and said she was so, so, sorry. She had no idea how stressed I was, how miserable, that I hid it so well.\n\nMost shockingly she admitted she had grown lax in her housekeeping and that in retrospect she was just so tired from dealing with the kids all day and working to boot cleaning and cooking hadn't really been at the forefront of her mind, since I'd been quietly making up for her slack and not saying anything she had just let it go unchecked.\n\nI told my wife there was no way I could take responsibility for two more children when I couldn't trust her to pull her load at the house. I said I was truy heartbroken for our nieces but that my children came first, and I could not jeopordize being a good father to them or have them lack in any facet of life because of them. I said a decision needed to be made soon and there was simply no way I could trust her to prove she would change and start helping out more and that we needed counseling because I was ready to end my life over how dreary and stressful things were. I also brought up we had no guarantees the girls wouldn't take after thier parents, particuarly her sister, as teenagers and make all our lives miserable.\n\nShe said she hadn't thought of that, and again how sorry she was and that I was right. She agreed immediately to counseling and that the dynamic of our home needed to change. That taking our nieces was out of the question when our own family needed some serious fixing. \n\nI could tell that my talk of suicide terrified her and she was willing to do anything to make things better. She begged me not to kill myself and then started sobbing and said she couldn't live without me, and to please not leave her and the kids.\n\nWe decided to talk about options for our nieces after getting some rest. My wife rubbed my feet until I fell asleep.\n\nThe next morning we took the kids to the park and while they were running around on the playground we discussed what to do about the girls. I brought up the girls father's families and asked if she knew any of them. She said no, but she could ask her sister for names and/or contact info.\n\nLong story short we found out Dad A had a brother, a married sister with kids and his parents. Dad B had a married brother, two sisters, one married no kids and the other with a boyfriend and two children, and his parents as well.\n\nMy wife and I sent emails to all introducing ourselves and laying out our nieces plight. That thier maternal grandparents could no longer care for them and that we were in no position to do so and were reaching out to see if they would be willing to take the girls who would have to be put in the foster system if we couldn't find someone.\n\nDad A's unmarried brother and Dad B's unmarried sister with kids never responded.\n\nDad A's sister, Dad B's brother and parents gave us varying responses which boiled down to \"sorry but no we can't/don't want to\"\n\nDad A's parents and Dad B's married sister without kids both gave us yes's! But here was the tricky part. They were only willing to take one child. Dad A's parents were sweet and polite but firm in saying they had no interest in raising another man's child, or dealing with potential drama from another baby daddy or baby daddy's family. Dad B's sister was also kind and said as much as she would like to, she and her husband were barely making ends meet and simply couldn't afford more than one child.\n\nMy wife and I were also in counseling at this point. We debated for awhile about whether to just take our nieces or to put them in homes where they would be loved and wanted but at the cost of splitting them up.\n\nI'm sure many Redditor's will bash me for our final decision, but it was with our therapists suggestion we finally decided our marriage and home life was too much on the rocks and had not had enough time to heal to take on the huge responsibility of raising my SIL's children.\n\nAnother long story short we got my in laws in contact with the other set set of grandparents and Dad B's sister and they are now in the middle of adoption and custody details. But from what I've heard is that the grandparents of niece A and the Aunt and Uncle of niece B will keep in contact and arrange in person play dates and Skype sessions so the sister's can stay in contact with each other and not suffer permanent seperation. We also told them that we still very much want to be in our nieces lives and would be willing to see them and have them for a couple days a few times a month or help in any way we could.\n\nThis was a very hard decision to make for my wife and I, but ultimately we feel we made the right one for us. We are still in therapy and are doing much better.\n\nMy wife is a much bigger help around the house and bought a book of easy recipes tailored to terrible cooks like her. We also took u/zizzmoo's suggestion and started doing a bunch of crockpot meals. It's cut down on labor and cleanup TREMENDOUSLY. In therapy I made a list of chores I'd like her to have done before I get home from work to minimize my stress. The list has really helped because she can focus on one check box at a time and has a visible reminder so she doesn't forget. Also thanks to u/zizzymoo we realized we were being way too easy on the kids and gave them a chore chart as well they need to check off, with allowence on Saturday if they finished everything and didn't rush through it. Seriously, thank you so much for your post u/zizzymoo, you had a lot of really helpful suggestions, even though we didn't end up taking our nieces.\n\nOur marriage isn't fully healed, but it's certainly recovered and I even look forward to coming home from work now.\n\nMy wife really is a saint and a sweetheart and I feel like I'm falling in love with her again.\n\nQuick note to say the sexism and misogony on this website was absolutely insane, people, mostly men, calling my wife lazy and horrible and saying she did nothing all day and was probably having an affair. When I stated in my first post my wife was a wonderful woman I meant it. Having three kids full time and a part time job is a lot of work. She was easily distracted and tired and cleaning just stopped being a priority. Since I always stepped up to the plate to cook and clean and never communicted my feelings, she had no way of knowing I was falling apart. She readily admitted her fault in the failure of our marriage and has truly shown she is fully committed to making things right again. I was shocked at the amount of hate shown on here for my wife, and can only say there are clearly a lot of bitter and obviously single people on this site.\n\nMy wife's parent's are sadly not doing so well with the combination of cancer and losing thier grandaughters, and my wife and I are trying to be as supportive and helpful to them as possible without jeopordizing the progress we've made in our marriage.\n\nMy wife's sister is still a batshit crazy worthless excuse of a human being who actually had the gall to call my wife up and thank her for \"sorting out the problem with the kids and getting it taken care of\" and then asking if we had any money we could possibly spare to lend to her. My wife basically told her sister to go fuck herself and that unless the money was for an operation to get her tubes tied to not ever contact her again.\n\nAll in all life isn't great but it is better and I can definitely see the light at the end of the tunnel for me and my family. Thank you to all the helpful redditors who cared. The douchebags know where they can shove it.\n\n**TL;DR Told my wife everything about wanting to commit suicide and how our marriage and my life no longer felt worth saving. She stepped up to the plate. We contacted relatives of nieces father's to see if they'd be willing to take them. The nieces are going to two different homes, but will still be in contact with each other, and we will still be a part of thier lives even though we decided not to adopt them. Wife and I still have a ways to go, but things are better and looking up.**\n\n",

            "I'm so glad you came back to update us... I was just thinking about you guys the other day and wondering how things were going.\n\nI think you and your wife made the right decision for your family, and it was really a stroke of genius to look into the paternal families and not assume based on the irresponsibility of the birth fathers.  And I'm so damn relieved you and your wife are in counseling and working towards BOTH of you being less overwhelmed!  That's absolutely fantastic to hear :)\n\n",
            "The attitude in this thread that telling your loved one that you're drowning and at risk of self harm equates to being manipulative is thoroughly disgusting and disappointing. I applaud you, OP - I've heard \"why didn't he just *talk* to me?\" too many times after the fact. Fear of this sort of attitude that labels asking for help as manipulative or attention seeking is usually the answer.",

My SO (m 39) had a similar thing happen to him and his brother when they were younger and honestly I don't think he's ever recovered from it. Feeling abandoned and alone. The worse part was his brother ended up in a not so great place, we think there was some abuse. His brother barely reached out to us for holidays etc. I've only met him once in eight years. Life is tough.",

You've taken care of your marriage as well as gone out of your way as reasonably as you could for your little nieces. Take care of yourself too. All the best.\n\n\n>My wife basically told her sister to go fuck herself and that unless the money was for **an operation to get her tubes tied** to not ever contact her again.\n\nI second this.",
            "I think you & your wife made a sensible, well thought out decision that is obviously best for your family & you should not feel guilty for this. However, have you checked in about how your wife is doing? Like really, properly, doing? Because she now has a mother with cancer, an ailing father, a husband with suicidal ideation, an alienated sister, nieces being placed away from her family, a part-time job & 3 kids to manage. That is a shitload of stuff to cope with, and you've just added more chores to the list too. No judgement, I'm sure she could help out more, but you should prioritize checking in with her & making sure she's okay too.",
            "You have handled a very difficult situation as well as you could and sought support from professionals.\n\nEach person and family deals with stresses in their own way.\n\nHow are the nieces doing after being separated?

Housework was very far down the list of necessary things. \n\nFood was made, laundry was done and after that it was Love me, Love my dust bunnies.",
            "All these people bashing you don't seem to realize how exhausting kids are.  You've already got three and you've admitted to feeling suicidal.  Adding two more to your home would almost certainly do you in.  You CANNOT be an adequate caregiver when you're stressed to breaking.  \n\nThe arrangements you made for those children are what you would've seen had you left it up to child services.  Child services will almost always look for kinship care before tossing kids in random homes.  Everyone that's screaming \"they could've been together in foster homes, why would you do this,\" just shut up.  You don't know.  \n\nUltimately I think you made the right decision.  And it's possible that after some time has passed there will be better living situations for the girls.  No one ever said this arrangement had to be permanent.",

            "I hate the idea of them being split up, but I'm glad that it worked out relatively well considering. I know it had to be a hard position to be in for everyone involved. I'm glad that you and your wife cared enough to make sure that they had homes with relatives that wanted them and will work to make sure that they can see each other. Also glad that you guys still want to be involved in their lives. Hopefully you have met with the relatives and made sure that they are decent people? And will continue to make sure that they're decent people? Because that part is worrying me a little. \n\nNow on to what pissed me off. \n\n>I also brought up we had no guarantees the girls wouldn't take after thier parents, particuarly her sister, as teenagers and make all our lives miserable.\n\nI do understand the actual reasons why you couldn't take them in, but that is an *extremely* shitty thing to say. You have no guarantee that YOUR kids won't turn out to be fuckheads as teenagers. These are kids that have been through a lot and deserve love. ",

            "That sounds great but I'm curious why you guys don't hire a housekeeper to come like .. once a week to take care of all of the \"big\" stuff you're too exhausted to clean. Yeah, it'd be some money but it wouldn't be *that* much money and it'll save you *a ton* of time and sanity.",
            "Good for you. I'm pretty sure I commented in your last thread, but I am a former foster care caseworker and I am here to tell you that **you absolutely made the right decision**. As a caseworker, I gained a lot of experience in what is known as 'kinship care', where kids removed from their natal homes become foster care kids but are ultimately placed with family. You would think I would be criticizing you for not taking your nieces in, but the truth is, if I were their caseworker, *I would never place them with you*. The point of foster care is to place children in homes that have the capacity for them. You guys are already at capacity. I would have done what you did, and located paternal family members willing to take them in. Social Services generally tries to avoid placing kids in kinship care in family homes that already have a large number of children. If you had just one niece that needed placement, and everybody in the family thought they could handle it, then Social Services might place her with you, but two nieces in a home where a parent is already overwhelmed is a recipe for disaster. In the state I worked in, Social Services pays child support to kinship foster families the same as non-kinship foster families, so there is no advantage for the state to choose kinship care, and if the family is overwhelmed there is a much higher likelihood that they will return the foster child back to Social Services care (I'm going to abbreviate it as DSS), which isn't good for anybody, but is especially bad for the child. I had a client in this situation. In his case, his aunt couldn't care for him because he had significant developmental, psychological, and behavioral issues and she became a single mother when she took him in. It was tough on everybody, and had I been around when he first entered the system, I would have objected to the placement.\n\n**You are doing the right thing.** I just cannot stress that enough. Even though the girls will be separated, this arrangement is still the best choice.\n\nAs for your wife, well, parenting is hard, and sometimes parents get complacent. I have a five year old son, and during his lifetime, both my husband and I have gotten complacent and left too much on the shoulders of the other parent. I think that is natural. Both times, the overburdened one has sat down with the complacent one and then sorted it out. I am not going to bash your wife. This is pretty normal.\n\nPlease consider getting individual counseling. Feeling worn down to the point of suicidal ideation needs to be addressed on it's own. Couples counseling is a great start, but individual counseling will help too. My husband and I have not needed couples counseling, but I have been in individual counseling for my own issues for a little while now, and I am happier, more functional, and a better wife and mother because of it.",
            "So she needs to do all the cleaning, cooking and child rearing while working a part time job. You are going to work and feeling stressed, so this entitles you to come home and just relax without doing the cleaning, cooking, child rearing? I would divorce you, this is life. There are going to be a lot more stressful thing in your life.  Do you expect your wife to always pick up the slack for you?",
            "Separating those girls will prove to be a life long traumatizing event.",

            "It's a shame that some of the worst people reproduce the most and then the responsibility falls on the rest of the family. But I think what you two decided on was the best decision for your family and no one on here has the right to tell you that you're wrong for it. \n\n",
            "Not being able to take them in I can kind of understand. \n\nBut I find the way you are talking as if this is a really good solution pretty hard to take. Two sisters got split up and shipped off to people they have never met before. People you know nothing about. \n\nCan you imagine that happening to your kids? \n\nI really don't understand this subreddit :(",
            "I really dislike the way you two call it \"picking up her slack.\" You are both working parents in a *partnership*. What the other person doesn't do **should** be done by the other and not looked at like slack being gathered. That's what being a team is. ",
            "This redditor wouldn't bash you, you did what was best for your own children and your marriage and your sanity. Raising three kids is tough. They need you. And having dealt with trying to raise someone else's very angry teenager myself, I can tell you it's no picnic. I think you did the best thing for everyone involved, even if it wasn't easy. The girls will hopefully get to know their other family members now too, and it's not like you can't continue to be a part of their lives. Good luck to both you and your wife. ",
            "1. All those people bashing your wife are assholes. I can't imagine raising 3 kids, while working part time every day. No wonder she's not doing many chores. She must probably feel very exhausted as well.  \n  \n2. You really shouldn't have gotten 3 children, sorry, mate. The situation you're in is unfortunately, because you seemed to overestimate your capabilities. Nothing to change now, of course, but just to put into perspectice, that I feel for you, but also think you made that mess yourself.  \n  \n3. Counselling was the right decision, but I would also suggest you might get some 1 on 1 with an expert, because of your feelings. You are burnt out (or almost there, but I'd say the feelings you describe fit that rather perfectly).  \n  \n4. What you need is your wife and children to take as much burden off of you as possible, which they seem to do now thanks to \"forgot his name's\" suggestion.  \n  \nGood luck and make sure that your children always know you love them but that they also understand the situation, that this family can only pull through if you all help each other.",

            ">Dad A's parents and Dad B's married sister without kids both gave us yes's! But here was the tricky part. They were only willing to take one child. Dad A's parents were sweet and polite but firm in saying they had no interest in raising another man's child, or dealing with potential drama from another baby daddy or baby daddy's family. Dad B's sister was also kind and said as much as she would like to, she and her husband were barely making ends meet and simply couldn't afford more than one child.\n\nIf Dad B's sister takes in the girl in a foster situation thru CPS, she should be able to get funding and help.  \n\nI'm glad you told your wife how you felt and things are looking up for you.  \n",

            "Why was adoption or foster care not an option? There are great families out there that foster and adopt. The girls would probably still be together too. \n\nSpeaking from experience, seperation from your siblings is a huge loss. The hurt can stay with you for a long time too. \n\n Considering their crappy childhoods they were probably closer to each other then other siblings who grew up in safe homes. \n\nAnd it just hurt your little heart to think of them in foster care, unseperated. Were the girls even asked which they would prefer?\n\nThats why I consider you an ass. Not because you couldn't take them yourself. Its good when families recognize their limits when it comes to taking on more kids. \n\nTo be fair I thought you were a misogynistic ass after your whining that your wife cant cook or clean. This is after you stated she works pt and takes care of the kids. \n\nThe misogynists that responded probably felt they were responding to one of their own. ",

I hope she feels free to tell OP when SHE'S on the ragged edge, because I would be, after about 48 hours.

My friend is carrying a HUGE load on her shoulders, her husband is angry and miserable, and their kids have paid a price as the home environment is very volatile. At the same time, the nieces, while together and in a good home must feel the anger and resentment of the others and feel like second class citizens. While it may have seemed like the best option at the time for the nieces, sometimes I wonder how their decision will end up impacting all of their futures and their relationships with each other.

        "selftext": "We've been together for 3 years. Lately he gets annoyed with me a lot, and doesn't hide it at all. He can get downright unfriendly, and it makes me feel worse than it probably should. I come from a family that is very civil, we never yell or swear at each other. He has a tendency to swear a lot in general, and has now taken to swearing when angry or upset at me. Anyway, quite frequently he'll just be in a huff about something I did wrong and display his annoyance at how useless I am openly. It has happened multiple times that it was something I had nothing to do with at all in the first place, and when that happened he did not even apologize, but acted as though he was justified in talking to me in this way because it \"usually\" is my fault anyway.\n\nAnyway, we live in his home country and I've been slow to learn the language, as I find myself surrounded by foreign students most of the day anyway (all our common friends are foreigners). An old friend of his came to visit, and stayed with us. I had never met said friend before, so I introduced myself. Pretty much as soon as I had finished my BF switched to his native language and started complaining about me right in front of me. He was absolutely unaware that I understand more than enough of the language to know he was talking about how \"useless I am\" (his words). I was floored at how he could do such a thing right in my face, to someone I was meeting for the first time. \n\nWe were going to grill and have a couple of beers, and I was pretty quiet because I was hurt. I didn't want to bring it up because we had a guest, and I thought I'd bring it up when we were alone. They were speaking in their language and I got bored, so I picked up my phone and checked my email. When I went to the kitchen to grab another beer, the boyfriend followed me and confronted me with why on earth I would behave so badly and sit on my phone while we had a guest, that I was acting as though someone had died and how I was acting like a rude B-word. (also his words) He was very angry, and started shouting while I just felt trapped, I couldn't go anywhere, his friend was sitting one room over and here I was being berated while I was still hurting from the way he had acted. \n\nHe pulled me to the bedroom and said that we were going to bed, that he didn't want to be around me like this and that if I couldn't behave there was no point in socializing. I did not want to go to bed at all, I was too upset. Nor did I want to go out into the living room and be with his friend, but I couldn't leave either. I can't remember clearly how I got out of the situation, I was too stressed, I just remember that finally I managed to convince him to go back to his friend because there was absolutely NO way I was going to lie next to him in bed while he was in such a mood. He was acting extremely cold, leaning away from touch and only talking to me to berate him. He went back to his friend once I said I'd come back later and I'd act \"okay\". I took ten minutes to compose myself and went out and acted like everything was fine and smiled and basically pretended the whole evening. \n\nThis shook me, and I started to notice that a lot of the time he is quick to act like I've committed a deadly sin when I do something that I feel isn't bad at all. Two days after this incident, he was smoking weed and I got tired (at 5 am), so I went to sleep while he didn't want to. The next day he did not talk to me in the morning, and then sometime in the afternoon when I asked why the fuck he wasn't talking to me he said it was because I was selfish and only ever did what I wanted (because I went to bed). \n\nI guess my question is, how do I get out of this situation? How do I stand up for myself when I feel like he is being unfair? How do I change this dynamic, or should I just give up? \n\n**Edit:** Thank you for all the advice. There's been a lot of comments so I haven't been able to keep up, but I am most certainly leaving him and I am still reading the comments, as there has been a lot of good advice regarding logistics and safety measures that I will look into implementing. From the bottom of my heart, thank all of you for the concern, advice, offers of help and most of all - opening my eyes! You guys and gals are great :)\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: I feel like my boyfriend has not been very nice lately (do correct me if I'm wrong though!), speaking about me to others right in my face when he thinks I can't understand and just being straight up mean for minor offences. I'm pretty timid and don't know how to stand up to it or change my situation. Can you help?",

            "First of all, you are being abused. Domestic abuse is not all about physical violence.\n\nIf, as you say, this is common behavior from him, you need to get out.\nI interpret from your posts that he used to swear when he got angry, but not at you, and over time that gradually moved onto you. He called you a rude bitch, and talks shit about you in front of his friends in a language you can't understand.\nI understand from what you wrote, that this is an average day for you - not a once in a lifetime thing.\n\nHe gets angry quickly, and your feelings are not valid so long as he is happy and getting what he wants. He thinks you are useless. Is that lazy useless, or stupid useless? Or both? Neither is a good thing to call someone you love, unless you apologize later at least.\n\nThis is pretty much class 101 for abuse tactics. You tear a person down by making them feel worthless. You trap them with you by teaching them that they can't do any better and they deserve your wrath. It's all downhill from there.\n\nDon't try to fix him. Don't stand up for yourself. Get out. You said yourself that his behavior is getting worse, and it will continue to get worse. Someone who treats you with that much disrespect does not love you. He doesn't care how you feel, he wants you to smile and put on a face for his company. You're not a person, you are a decoration. A fashionable piece of clothing for him. And you need to get the hell out.\n",

He openly insults you, and then gets upset with you for objecting. He isolates you, and gets irrationally angry when you assert your needs. When you argue with him, he tries to assert control physically (by cornering you in a room) and by telling you what to do (demanding you go to bed).\n\nMany relationships are worth fixing. This one is unfixable. Move on. After 3 years, you may have forgotten what it's like to be able to be yourself, and not have to walk on eggshells all the time.",

            "If you can, read a book called \"Why does he do that?\" by Lundy Bancroft. Forcing you into a room, forcing you to go to bed when you don't want to, is physical abuse. It's a direct threat, that's why you are afraid. (Don't do this while you're still with him or he could see you with it anywhere)\n\nTake all your important documents. Make sure to change passwords to everything you possibly can. Find out if your country has resources for domestic violence situations. If yes, there may be an escort available for you, to make sure nothing happens to you while you collect your things. Collect your things when he's away. It's paramount to stay safe - is there literally nobody you could possibly ask to accompany you for a short time? An understanding coworker perhaps, or a classmate that doesn't know him, doesn't have any connection to him? Movers? Other service workers?\n\nGet these important things - you say two, three boxes? - That's not that big of an amount. You could actually load all that into a cab. Then go stay somewhere else. Don't tell anyone he can contact your whereabouts. Do tell someone he can't contact - your family perhaps? Tell this person about him and how he will most likely pretend you're in danger or missing, but whatever he does, they cannot give him even a morsel of info. Establish a safety switch with someone, it can be your family too: if you don't call them by X hour, they should call the police and tell them everything. Have this in place for the first week or so if you don't have anyone.\n\nAt work/school, talk to people. Do you have a school counselor? Talk to them. Do you have a therapist or a doctor you see regularly? Talk to them. Tell them you're afraid and are unsure what to do, they will be able to help you or direct you to local resources much better than us. Try to make new friends (not ones connected to your soon to be ex).\n\nAfter you move your important stuff out and are safely at an undisclosed location, leave him a note or send him a text breaking up. Don't risk a face-to-face meeting, there's really, really no point. Do NOT go back to his place EVER AGAIN. No matter what excuse he might come up with, no matter how much he apologizes or whatever - there are countless stories of people fooled by a charming abuser's crocodile tears, going to their place again, only to get themselves attacked or worse once the door is closed. When you leave an abuser, they lash out big time. If you ever need to meet with him face to face, which I really don't think you ever will - it needs to be a public place and you need to park close to the front (if the place has an underground garage, pick a different place). \n\nDon't be afraid to make a scene or call the police if he ever gives you trouble or harasses you. You matter. ",

Cut off all contact when you leave to visit your family but don't tell him you're breaking up with him. Do that after you're gone then cut off all contact.

You are worse off with him than without, and he can actually drag you down to the point of compromising your well-being, and thus your studies. \n\nYour boyfriend does not have your back, and, as you note, his friends have loyalties to him over you. So don't ask them for any help. \n\nI hope that you can reach out to some colleagues or instructors for assistance moving out/storing your books and things.

Just dare to ask, nicely and politely, and I am sure that some will agree to lend a hand, a  couch or a closet. \n\nThen yes you need to figure out more stable accommodations for yourself, where you will be away and safe from that toxic boyfriend of yours. I know that this may sound overwhelming, but once it'll be done it won't feel so bad. You may well feel so much better.

If this is very recent and he hasn't been this much of a dick in the past, he probably has been thinking about how much he wants to break up with you and it makes him mad. It typically doesn't have anything to do with you specifically, but his own feelings about the idea of a relationship. I've been in that situation, the month long or so period where you are frustrated at your GF because you think you don't like them very much. It doesn't mean he has fully came to that conclusion, it means he has been thinking about all the things he dislikes about you and its the only thing he can think about. This happens to guys a lot in relationships around that time, typically its because they don't see themselves as 'free' like their single friends and begin to resent their partner just for being their partner.\n\nIts possible he may get over this, its possible he may not and break up with you, and even worse, its possible he may not get over it and not break up with you and become abusive. A lot of commenters are saying that this is already abusive behavior, but typically this place is very quick to label everything as abusive. Its shitty behavior but that doesn't mean he is an abuser based on this one incident. Its possible he just had a bad moment where he was mad at you, we ALL do shitty thing's when we are mad. I wouldn't be so sure to shout ABUSE ABUSE!... yet. These things can quickly get out of hand. That behavior can change if you allow it to continue without being resolved. \n\nEven a nice, sweet SO can turn into an abuser if the relationship goes sour enough. \n\nI would leave him before he makes the move, and make a big deal out of it too. Leave without warning, and make sure he knows and feels bad for the reasons why you left. ",

        "selftext": "Link to my [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mi0e8/i_26f_missed_an_important_funeral_and_now_i_think/)\n\nOriginal TLDR: my boyfriend can\u2019t forgive me for missing his grandmother\u2019s funeral, but it was scheduled only 4 days before I had to hand in my huge research project for my masters degree. He has been distant and treating me coldly and for the past 2 months and now wants me to go back to my home country and leave him to grieve alone for a few weeks. He says he needs some space and is considering moving out of our home; but overall wants us to still be together. Advice? Help?\n\n\nI just wanted to first say thank you very much for all of your advice, it was really helpful, it made me feel like less of a terrible person and made me realise that my boyfriend is still mourning the loss of his grandmother. My SO and I had a long discussion the night I posted for advice on Reddit; and we agreed that we wanted to be together but that something needed to change in our relationship. We set some basic ground rules; we both agreed to start seeing separate therapists, him for his grief and troubles with his Dad and me for my lack of confidence and stress management. He again asked for space, so he moved out of our bedroom and into the spare bedroom in our flat. I also booked a flight home for a few weeks to visit my own family, and I am set to leave in 4 days. \n\nWe were making some good progress this week, enjoying time with each other, going to the park, just generally trying to reconnect. After sleeping in the spare bed for 5 days, he decided to move back into our room, and I was very happy about that. Up until 2 days ago I genuinely thought that we were going to make it through this. \n\n\nThings came to a head last night; I received my grades back from the school. I am very proud to say that I got an A on my research project, and one of my urban design proposals has also been nominated by my school for a Gold award from the RIBA. I am incredibly proud, this year was definitely the most difficult in my entire life and I did not expect to do as well as I actually did, I literally just wept when I get my results. \n\n\nI sent my SO a long message, letting him know how I did, and about the nomination, but more importantly thanking him for being there to support me through my degree. I told him I loved him, and that I was glad we were working together on our relationship. \n\n\nHe came home that night fuming; he was so angry. He just yelled at me for basically an hour, about my lack of confidence in my own work, and about how I didn\u2019t need to miss his grandmother\u2019s funeral. He told me he hated me, and after that I sort of just numbed out. I don\u2019t really remember much of what he said after that, I just stopped talking and listening. \n\n\nMy final, end of year show is happening this week. It\u2019s a huge celebration of the student\u2019s work; I\u2019ve filled an entire wall to exhibit my architectural work and my research results. During the end of year show a lot of people find jobs, so it\u2019s important for us to be there to network and talk about our projects with people in the industry; I did this for my boyfriend last year when he exhibited his own work, I spent 6 hours at that event talking to different people about how amazing his work was. This morning he told me not to expect him to come tonight, because he needs to go to the gym. \n\n\nI\u2019m flying home in 4 days, and I can tell that he just wants me to leave and never come back, which is what I am doing. I have stuck with all my promises that I made to him, I\u2019ve supported him as best I could and I\u2019ve begun seeing a therapist. He hasn\u2019t even called his GP to get a referral to a therapist yet. He doesn\u2019t want to fix our relationship; he just wants to keep me around to pay half of our rent and to use as a punching bag. \n\n\nSo we\u2019re over, I just paid my final half of the rent, and I\u2019m moving back to my home country. I was originally only planning on returning for a few weeks, but with this \u2018Brexit\u2019 vote looking so grim I don\u2019t really see the point in being in the UK anymore. Why return and find a job here when I will most likely be asked to leave in a year? I Like the UK, and I love my boyfriend, but it seems neither wants me so I\u2019m going home to take care of myself. \n\n\nTLDR; Tried to use Reddit\u2019s advice to fix my relationship, worked for just over a week.  I got my grades back and I did extremely well, my SO threw that back in my face, and is now refusing to come to my final exhibition of my work.  So we\u2019re over, I\u2019m moving back home, I have no plans to ever return to the UK.\n\n \n\n\n\n",

I can certainly imagine that he will come around at one point and realise how idiotic his behaviour was, but I can totally see why you wouldn't want to wait for this since this day could also never come.",
            "Congratulations, you've done really well in the circumstances. I'm sorry that your relationship isnt functioning as it used to. I wanted to tell you that you werent wrong to concentrate on your school work. Yes, its your partner's family, but we both know that would not be a valid excuse in university. I've seen them ask for death certicates as proof before and thats only for immediate family. \n\nI feel for your partner, because my grandmother practically raised me and I would be so lost without her. However, that is my own feeling. I wouldnt be angry at someone if they couldnt go to a funeral with me. Even if it was my partner, I think that if the reason is very important, which yours is, then that is okay. \n\nHe's grieving and is lashing out at you because youre the closest to him and thats what people do. It is not the correct way of dealing with it but they do. I think he does need some space. And you should at least let him know that you are thinking of staying with your own family, and not returning. \nI'm sorry that this referendum is affecting your decision too, honestly, if I could up and go I would. and I'm British. I cant stand it, and we'll be losing thousands and thousands of great people if it does happen. Honestly I'm scared, and I would just leave if I could. I cant imagine what it feels like to be on the receiving end of all this leave rhetoric. \n\nYou'll be okay, I can tell. You're smart and a lot stronger than you think for persevering through your degree. Best wishes to you, whatever your decision. ",
            "Op, my boyfriend and I had only been together 6 months when my grandma died. It was during the time of his midterms. I of course went to spend her last days with her; by the time he finished and left to join me, she passed away while he was on the way. She was a second mother to me and I had desperately wanted him to meet her. I was disappointed and a little hurt, and every once in a while I still am sad she never met him since he is now my husband, but I never took that out on him. Your partner's grief was understandable; his treatment of you was wrong and you were right bit to stay there and be his punching bag.",
            "A partner is supposed to support you in difficult times and in good times. You helped him in every way that you possibly could and he didn't appreciate it, and also couldn't support you. You're better off without him.\n\nCongratulations on your achievements, you should be really proud of yourself! ",
            "Hate? He hates you? You really supported him to the best of your ability. I have to say he probably had expectations of the relationship that were different than yours. You saw yourselves as equals and he saw you as a supporting role in his life.\n\nYour life sounds awesome btw. I'm so sorry you endured this, but damn woman. You are so strong to keep your head up and keep kicking ass the whole way through. Do awesome things.",
            "I don't think you should leave the UK forever. You never know what the future will hold, and you sound like a smart hard worker. That's very valuable. \n\nI think it's right that you and your ex broke up. He definitely was using you as a punching bag and wasn't keeping up his end of the bargain. He is t ready for you and your achievements. \n\nDon't take your grief out on your career though. You are capable of so much, and I think that a lot of people here would agree. ",
            "He can't continually use grief as an excuse for his bad behavior. ",
            "I think the rancid cherry on top of this totally not okay sundae is him saying he was skipping your end of the year show because he had to go to the gym. That's such a passive aggressive and petty thing to do. You missed the funeral because you had educational obligations that couldn't be postponed. Trying to compare that to 'going to the gym' is completely out of line and mean spirited.\n\n I know grief can make people lash out, but to still be acting like this after you made an agreement to strengthen the relationship shows he's not ready to move on from being angry. And his version of angry is just cruel and abusive. I think you're making the right choice. \n\nCongrats on all of your success. You worked hard and totally kicked butt. I hope you can *BUILD* a great future back in your home country, and continue to grow as the lovely person you sound like. :) ",
            "You made the right choice. I thought a lot of his reaction was wrapped up in his grieving process in the first post, which maybe some of it is, but that's never an excuse to treat someone like this without making any effort toward change. You stuck around and gave the relationship one last try and he's (literally and metaphorically) going to the gym. It shows how little he's invested in changing or improving any part of himself for you. ",
            "Congratulations on your graduation and success, OP! I'm sorry it's come with such a painful personal situation. However, I think you're doing the right thing.\n\nThere are a lot of clear, obvious red flags in your descriptions of your boyfriend's behavior. The verbal punching bag stuff in particular is horrible. But honestly, the point I keep getting hung up on in your post is the fact that your boyfriend refused to attend your final show because he had to go to the gym.\n\nThe freaking gym.\n\nYou described how important this show is to people in your field and how you spent hours the year before networking in support of your boyfriend's work. He drew a direct parallel between you missing his grandmother's funeral because you were racing to finalize the culmination of your educational career (after many supportive acts following her death) and him missing this vital final show of your work because he was going to a gym for a random workout. That just blows my mind.\n\nI cannot even express how unreasonable and disrespectful he's being. Grieving or not, some words can't be excused and some actions can't be taken back. I'm glad you're moving on and have found a great job, though I'm so sorry about the painful circumstances prompting you to do so. Good luck and be well. ",

Besides, the vote hasn't even happened yet. You would be losing valuable networking that you've busted your butt for, you shouldn't torpedo that just because your boyfriend turned into an asshole. It sounds like you're trying to punish yourself, that you're still feeling guilty.\n\nSo stay. Start your own life. If you have to leave, you can leave then but I doubt it will come to that.

I lashed out at everyone. I ruined relationships with very important people in my life and I regret it. \n\nYour boyfriend might be going through the same thing. I'm decently sure that his behavior toward you isn't personal, nor is it really about you. He's in pain. Pain makes people do things they wouldn't normally do. He's gonna act crazy because right now, he damn well is. He doesn't even really know what he's doing: he's acting on pure emotion. \n\nThe loss of a loved one is a crazy, crazy time. I can tell you this with certainty: make sure you really, *really* want to leave, because if you do now, it's unlikely you'll come back. \n\nYou can try to stick it out and work through the grief. It's possible. I've known people who have done it. Or you can leave and start over. The choice is yours. ",
            "I'm thinking he's actually jealous you're doing so much better than him, and him trying to get you to go to his grandma's funeral KNOWING you had your final project coming up was a way to sabotage you. And when you didn't take the bait for it and ended up doing really well he was angry because his plan to ruin you failed.

And the level of intimacy and closeness he and his grandmother shared. I don't think anyone would blame you (and many would commend you) for leaving, but I cannot imagine the immeasurable level of grief he is going through. Grief makes you mad. It is a real pain. Heartbreak is real, a sense of loss is a really dark emotion. I can't even imagine how difficult it will be when my boyfriend loses members of his family (knock on wood).  \n  \n  \nI don't know if your relationship is salvageable but I can understand to some degree his response to your email about your academic achievements. I feel like he interprets your project, and therefore your studies, to be what caused you to miss the funeral. I know you tried your best to be there for him but I'm sure he felt alone, abandoned. It sounds like you and his grandma were the two main emotional and intimate pillars of his life and he lost one and the other wasn't fully there for him as he would have wanted. Fear and loss make people irrational and so despite your reason for not attending the funeral being valid, I doubt he perceives it that way. You sharing your achievements was probably a reminder of that anger and abandonment, and while you think he has not been there to support your achievements and hard work, I think to some degree he feels that you were not fully there for him.    \n        \nThat being said, I feel for you. And for him. But maybe in the end it shows you two were not right to be together because the both of you did not know how to work through a really critical and pivotal moment in both of your lives.",

He went back to his home country and probably dug up the past like his father beating him which you previously mentioned. \n\nHe was acting out, he needed something or someone to blame and he did it all wrong and thats all HIS fault. He shouldn't have treated you wrong and responded in anger that he has, Im sick of reddits normal response and telling you to just leave him because hes an idiot. He's not an idiot and you have a PhD so you should know that. You love him for a reason, Don't let reddit tell you otherwise.\n\nFind some help so you can both sit and talk calmly about issues you have in the relationship even including his recent passing of his grandmother and your inability to attend the funeral.\n\nAnother note, he was probably angry at you not attending because something could have happened at the funeral with his family that made him so angry about you not being able to attend. It could his family talking badly about you, or his family talking badly about him and you weren't able to be there for him.

I agree he's not in the right for lashing out at you, but I can understand how it may feel to him like you are gloating. When you lose someone so important, it hurts so much. It even hurts that the world just goes on as usual; it feels like it should stop and not move ahead. You moving ahead is like salt in the wound.\n\nHe needs to work on his grief, for sure.

This is all thanks to the hard work and effort you placed over the last few years and a lot of people are proud of you for this!\n\nI can understand your now ex's grief over his grandmother but I don't think he realizes that he cannot always have his grandmother stuck in his head forever, and hope that he eventually learns to let go of the now defunct past.  \n\nJudging by your last paragraph though, it seems like you have made a decision with him becoming your ex but you haven't actually let him know?  You probably should do so even if you do or do not come back to the UK based on the Brexit / EU Referendum.  The biggest mistake you can make is basing your current assessment on wanting to leave UK for good because your ex is there and that shouldn't be placed as a limitation for the knowledge you carry.  \n\nSure if you can find a better place for your work outside of the UK go for it, but if there's already a suitable offer waiting for you in the UK, I would say go for it there for however long you can to build up your knowledge outside of school so that in the future you can move up in the world.  \n\nAgain many grats to you, and it was def correct to finish your project vs attending his grandmother's funeral regardless of the timing of this.  Your education should always be a priority over anything that doesn't directly affect your life.  If I was your SO I would be extremely proud of you and would ask you to come visit the grandmother's site to relay the message to her in Heaven of how extremely proud he is to have met you, but alas this is something your ex can't do which is unfortunate.",

Everytime I have experienced a loss, it always brings out the worst and the best of people.  It sounds like he was at his worst, as a partner you might have tried to be at your best.  It's a really rough thing to deal with.  People act irrationally when those they love die.\n\nYour ex only threw your good grades back in your face, because you threw them in his.  This relationship sounds like it's over, but maybe for the next one, you might be a little less selfish, a little more empathetic.  You're not wrong for being proud of your achievements, and wanting to share them with the people you love.  But, you need to understand when it's appropriate to do that.

            "First if you can't skip one day of work it means that you are badly organized at doing your work.\nSame thing if your work isn't finished a week before the deadline (for a multi-year project ...).\n\nI am PhD student and I have this excuse a lot from grad and undergrads I TA all the time. \"I was too busy\" when I clearly know they are not, none of them is half as busy as I am (I can still remember as I took excess courswork during my undergrad while working a part time job) and I am not half as busy as my supervisor. Each time I get the \"too busy\" excuse I never let it slide, it literally translates to \"I suck at managing my time\".\n\nThat said it doesn't change the fact that after you poorly managed your time, you end up not having time to spare in the last few days when the work should have been long done already. So at the point of the funeral I believe you when you say you couldn't spare time on something else than your study.\nBut sooner you could have handled things in a more organised way to be sure you could have been available at that time.\n\nYou say all this yourself there: \n\n\"Over those few weeks after she passed away, I tried to spend a lot of time with him. I took him to the archdiocese and we lit candles and walked through the gardens and talked about his grandmother. His friends came up for a visit that weekend and I spent the weekend with them to keep him happy, even though I should have been working on finishing my research project\"\n\nI realise it's easy to say that to someone after it happened \"you could have done things differently\" etc. But it's still kind of true and that makes his point of view more understandable. Although to me he is being kind of a jerk, I'd never be mad at someone for not attending a funeral, even if it was my sister not attending my parents funeral...\nNo matter if you could or could not have taken time to go, it's a shitty reason for being mad at you, especially after you already spent all that time with him before !

            "Might not be the popular opinion, but he still needs you.  I am coming at this having been in his shoes.  He is going through a mental health crisis.  The first step for him is isolation.  He is trying to push you away first because you are closest.  Once you are gone, he is going to begin pushing others away until he is fully isolated.  Next there will be a major event, whether it be, drugs, alcohol, suicide, or some other traumatic event predicated on a lack of feeling or judgement.\n\nI know it's hard, but you have been with this guy for a while.  At some point you definitely need to start thinking about yourself, but I'm not sure you've done everything you can yet to salvage this or help him.  You need to help lead him to a change.  His blow ups at you are a red herring, they are actually some sort of internal struggle that he isn't yet recognizing.  Something that is difficult for him to process, so he shifts over to something else, something that in his head makes sense, but to the outside observer seems ridiculous.  This is easier, because he doesn't have to process the emotions of whatever it is that is eating him up.\n\nI know it is hard, but try not to take his attacks personal.  If and when he comes up out of the fog, and if you do the right thing by supporting him, he will recognize the idiocy of what he is saying and will apologize.  If you succeed, your relationship will be much stronger after this.  This is the shit that makes couples, makes them life partners.  What sucks about relationships, is that this isn't even the hardest thing you will ever have to deal with.  This is why they say that relationships are hard work - sometimes only one partner is doing the work, but it is still hard. \n\nYou need to work on opening up the communication first.  Then he needs to talk to someone (probably multiple people), you may need to hand-hold him there - maybe even literally.\n\nPM me if you want to chat more in depth about my experiences or if any of this resonated and you want more detail.
