She hasn't been a bad friend since I met her. She's one of those \"SuperWhoLock\" theatre push-over tumblr gals (her words, not mine). So this took me by surprise. \n\nI decided to sit her down in a public place and speak with her about the issue. I told her that I don't have a lot of money and I won't flip the bill on trips she invites me too. \n\nOf course, she got angry. She stated that I shouldn't *use* her and I was a bad friend. \n\nI ended up giggling in reply, as I do this when I'm nervous. This infuriated her. \n\nShe went on a long winded monologue about how she knows my *type* and how since she's from Long Island I think she has money. Blah blah blah. \n\nWhen she finally stopped, I informed her that that was not the case. I explained that I don't care about her parent's money, but our friendship. After further discussion, she started to tear up. \n\nTurns out that though Mommy and Daddy bought her the car AND was providing her with gas money (an allowance, per se), she was saving up for something she wanted. This *something* was a five thousand dollar trip to have her online boyfriend fly up this summer and to put him in a ritzy hotel. Her parents didn't approve of her relationship, so they would not fund it. \n\nApparently, she has been hustling people out of their money in order to fund the trip, while continuing her luxury lifestyle. \n\nI believe she expected me to feel some sort of sympathy for her. She was teary eyed and sniffling about *true love* and how she is doing this to meet the *one*. But I couldn't take it. \n\nI ended up explaining to her that she cannot use people as human ATMs. And that even though she is a nice girl, I don't appreciate her doing ugly things. \n\nShe babbled on about how I wouldn't understand because *love* or some shit. \n\nI sighed and ended my friendship with her on the spot. I've spent a lot of time with this girl and collected several good memories, but someone who refuses to see their own wrong doings is not for me. \n\nTL;DR: Confront friend about using me. She denies it, saying I'm using her. She reveals why she was using me (and others). I end the friendship when she refuses to see the error of her ways. \n\nEDIT: Wouldn't really classify her as a \"Tumblrina\". She likes tumblr culture, but she isn't as radical/insane as the ones I've seen online. \n\nEDIT 2: Still very much Gay. ",

            "I often wonder what the ceiling is for people like this in terms of personal growth.  I know a lot of people who were entirely self-centered and ridiculous like this in their teens who turned it around and became mature, great humans.  However, I have not met many people who were able to grow past such behaviors after they hit 20.  I don't know if it's some sort of critical period, or if I'm just entirely wrong, but it just seems like when a person is still treating other people like props in their life by the time they're supposed to be at least somewhat personally independent and responsible, the future is bleak.\n\nLet's hope that your ex-friend learns how to be a regular human person sometime in her future.  However, you're making the right move not waiting around to find out if she does.",

Ugh.\n\nCongrats on dumping a greedy, stupid, *and* selfish friend!",

Still super sucky though, breaking up with friends is rough. Good for you for standing up to her. ",

I wouldn't want to be friends with someone that thought it was okay to use people as human ATMs. It's a huge red flag. \n\nIf she's willing to basically trick/guilt you into accompanying her on these excursions just to ask for 'gas money', what else is she capable of? The fact that she clearly planned this money-making strategy out is freaky enough.

            " OP I don't think it had many up votes but I said this on the last one. And this is a lesson that I have learnt and a thing you may notice that people do in the future. Some kids that come from money and have an expense that their parents won't pay, are so used to viewing people as a cash source, not a job, and \"earning\" money not from their hard work, but just being them. Confronted with their parents not giving them money will figure out ways to get it from others. All of a sudden every favour they did you ever will need you to pay them back, or they will want back items that they gifted you years ago.\n\nIt's unfortunate that your friendship had to end, but you have also learned a behaviour you can keep an eye out for in the future and save yourself further heartache.\n\nAlso I find it ironic that she is worried that everyone thinks she is a moneybags, when clearly the guy in this long distance relationship does and is exploiting it.",
            "That...is utterly ridiculous and very nasty. I come from a wealthy background and non of my childhood friends have ever tried to use others as human ATMs. This is not some bizarre misunderstanding of the value of money or other people's income brackets - this is her being a nasty human being and not seeing you guys as human, but in terms of what you can do for *her*. This flies straight past \"selfish\" and lands squarely on \"narcissistic\". Good for you OP for ending the friendship. I don't think this person really understands what friendship even is.",

That whole \"plan\" of hers and how she is ripping off her friends to fund it is just so wrong and stupid on so many levels. People who try to pull off shit of this caliber got issues and will more or less always try to pull off something equally or more retarded down the line. Good riddance.",

            "Bravo mate. It is always something else that makes you very upset. It wasn't your laugh. It was that she already knew, maybe subconsciously, that what she was doing was wrong. At least I deeply hope she realizes that what she is doing is just a ludicrous way to treat people.",

And expect her to expect you to do this. \n\nMy advice is, YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE, RIGHT NOW. are you willing to be her friend despite her accusations OR is she a person you can live with out?\n\nYour choices are: 1) stay in her life as a PLATONIC FRIEND and stop paying for her and understand that she is MENTALLY SICK and that this is why she does what she does OR 2) CUT ALL TIES, Before she wastes your life with her drama and untrue accusations\n\nshe might not have a mental disorder she could just be a drug addict (drugs include alcohol, inhaling nos/computer cleaners ect) \nIf you are sleeping with her, in a way she's right when she says you are using her. So to get away from that, you need to keep the friendship platonic (no sex, no kissing, no flirting, no touching of any kind And no seal activity or talk whatsoever with each other).\n\nDon't sleep with her even if she begs.

I know most suggested spending money on lawyers/gps/private investigators and stuff but I needed to know for myself so I stuck with the original plan.\n\nAs she was getting into the car I came out and said \"hang on, I'm coming too. I've been thinking about losing weight and you don't want to be married to a fat fuck like me.\"\n\nShe laughed and said \"don't be daft, you're not fat! But it will be brill if you join too, then we can do the sauna '  stuff.\"\n\nSo we set off in completely a different direction of the gym. I asked her about the local gym and she laughed again and said \"How much money do you think we have!\" apparently the gym near us is really expensive.\n\nThen the best bit: she then pulls over and out of this house comes the guy ('Steve') built like a boxer and climbs into the car and another, slightly smaller. As soon as they get in all my worries disappear. This was Steve pronounced 'Thteven'; as camp as they come and then proceeded to flirt WITH ME! The other guy was his boyfriend.\n\nWhen we got home later I asked her about him on Facebook and she said \"if I said I'd emptied the bin he'd like it!\"\n\nThen I showed her the Reddit posts and she laughed and said why didn't you just ask me who he was. And then she laughed again when she read I went to the wrong gym.\n\nShe said some unflattering things about one or two messages but I don't care. All is well.\n---   \n**tl;dr**: Wrong gym, gay dude.\n\nEdit: I'm a little overwhelmed by the massive response this got. I thought there were just a few people following the story. My gut feeling was that there was nothing wrong because everything else just seemed so normal like I said in the first posts. I feel a bit bad (and a bit daft) about checking up and misleading her but she just found it funny. \n\nWe don't normally go into detail about who we are with and where we are going. I play football and she's probably met 2 of my friends and would have no idea who I collect in my car when I go. She doesn't hang out with him. They attend the same 'box-fit' class and sometimes she's picked him up en-route. \n\nAnyway, that's it. I can go back to using my proper account now. Thanks everyone, including the ones who tried to convince me I was practically divorced and broke.",

I know that she plans gifts really far in advance and always dedicates so much time & thought into them, and I am so grateful for every gift I have ever received because I know how special they are. She'll often take something small I said from years back and make a really meaningful thing out it, and I know she enjoys gift giving and it is clearly one of primary ways she communicates her love for me and others. \n\nI just can't keep up. I've never been a really good gift-giver. I often really struggle with forming ideas for upcoming celebrations, and until I'm really under the pump, I come up empty handed until I find something just alright or I repeat a similar schtick of \"reasons why I value you\" presents. \n\nThis just means that I feel so much stress every time I have to celebrate her birthday & Christmas, especially because I would have received something completely out of this world. I really just feel like my gifts pale in comparison. It's getting to this stage where we've been exchanging presents for 8 years and I'm honestly just starting to feel like I'm running out of steam to keep up and continue thinking of other ideas. It is also hard because I'm neither here nor there when it comes to receiving gifts. I can recognise the hard work and love, but I don't *need* to receive gifts to know that I'm loved, and so I worry that I don't reciprocate my love well enough because my presents never feel at her level. \n\nI want to express to her my gratitude for her gifts but ask that we just stick to one a year, on birthdays, because Christmas and the occasional Valentines' Day is too much for me. I have been able to move away from gift-giving with other friends by just casually mentioning it or just mutually ceasing present exchanges, and we now opt for spending time with each other - something I love. I just don't know if this would be really insensitive or soul-crushing because it's not about her or how good of a friend she is, but really about my insecurity and my differing ways of communicating love. \n\nI know I've got to have the conversation, but does anyone have any tips or advice for how I could communicate this in a tactful and non-hurtful way? \n\nTL;DR: my best friend is a great gift-giver and expresses her love through that, but I don't and so I feel my gifts are incomparable. I want to only exchange presents once a year and opt to spend time with her for other celebrations but don't know how to deliver this in a sensitive and thoughtful way.\n\nEdit: thank you all so much! I'm trying to get around to reading all the comments but I just want to say that I appreciate everyone's perspectives and input. It's really been helpful for me to consider different ways of having the conversation and problem-solving our way to a more mutually agreeable situation. \n\nAlso, yes, she's definitely the Leslie Knope in this instance.

            "Personally I sound like you're friend - I LOVE giving people gifts and it brings me so much joy than actually receiving a gift (not to say I don't appreciate presents because I do very much no matter how \"pale\" they seem in comparison) \n\nGiving a gift means more to me than just spending money on someone I love and if my friends felt they couldn't \"keep up\" I would want them to talk to me about it but please keep in mind that she may enjoy the act of gift giving and not be bothered by the kinds of gifts you get her as at the end of the day, you have thought about her! It makes me happy just to know someone has thought about me rather than what the gift actually is. \n\nI honestly wouldn't think too hard into it about not getting her gifts of the same level as we are all different! She probably loves you just for thinking about her and getting her something! \n\nIt would definitely upset me if my friends didn't want to accept anything from me in terms of gifts as it really is the way I process my affection and love for people. \n\nHope it works out for you but communication is key with keeping a good friendship alive!

            "I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard of love languages, but giving/receiving gifts is a love language.Like you said, it\u2019s the way your friend communicates her love for others and it\u2019s very likely that receiving thoughtful gifts from others is meaningful to her. I am definitely one of those people like your friend. I think you should be careful to explain how you feel really to your friend, because if you don\u2019t it could really hurt her feelings. I\u2019m not blaming you in any way because I understand that gift giving just isn\u2019t your thing. But for people with this love language a disinterest in gifts and low effort gifts can be interpreted as a lack of love/interest itself. Like I said, please explain how you feel to her carefully and in depth, and acknowledge that you are grateful for her gifts. Like someone else mentioned, maybe suggesting spending quality time together as an alternative is a good idea to emphasize that you still love and value her. If she insists on still giving you gifts without getting one in return, please consider letting her do that. As someone with this love language, it took a while for me to accept that giving gifts isn\u2019t the way everyone expresses love, and I had to accept that low effort gifts from friends didn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t love me because they show they love me in other ways. Giving them gifts they love brings me so much happiness anyway. Hopefully after you discuss this with your friend she\u2019ll understand too!",
            "I would not feel obligated to give something in return. Or you could even stick to something very easy like a gift certificate to a place she loves. Unless she has said something about your gifts not being up to scratch (doesn't sound like she has) I don't think she's looking for you to live up to her level of giving. People who put a lot of thoughts into gifts like the giving. I have several friends I gift to who don't give in return and it has never occurred to me to be bothered by it because I don't consider that the point of gift-giving.\n\nI would just talk to her about it. Be honest that you feel your gift-giving is inadequate compared to hers and you love and appreciate how much effort she puts in, but that gift-giving is not your thing. She will probably tell you that she loves giving gifts and you equally reciprocating is not important to her.\n\nOne thing I want to mention. I don't think you're an asshole for feeling this way, but in a sort of backwards way, if this is what she's good at and how she shows affection, it's a little selfish to ask her to stop because you feel you can't reciprocate. Everyone shows love differently. Of course, if her gifts make you uncomfortable, of course you can ask her to stop. But if you're just stressed because you can't give in the same way, let her keep doing it and work on taking the pressure off yourself.",
            "She sounds like a lovely friend! I too have trouble accepting gifts. I feel awkward receiving them, it often feels like someone is trying to buy my affection, and I hate showing affection by buying something. \n\nI've talked a lot about this with my therapist and the conclusions that I came to are:\n\n1) That I need to allow people (that I want in my bubble of course) to show love for me and that I am worthy of this affection even if it feels like I don't deserve it or I don't reciprocate in some way\n\n2) Be open and honest when you are uncomfortable, like if I am feeling awkward and I'm not grateful enough simply saying \"I really love what you got me, I'm just super awkward about gifts! I truly love it though\" or if you don't understand or appreciate why they got that particular thing, say \"oh wow! What's the story behind you gifting me this?\"\n\n3) Meet your loved ones half way. Maybe ask her what she values and if she doesn't value gifts the same way she loves giving them, get her a cooking class or tickets to a show or even a gift card with a note. Relationships (even friendships) require give and take. It just depends on how much give and take that each party is comfortable with. \n\nI hope this helps! I am still working on this myself \ud83d\ude0a",
            "I love giving gifts, and I really love making people gifts. It makes me happy. I do not require the same effort in return at all.  Unless she has expressed disappointment over your gifts in the past, I wouldn't stress out so much about matching her gifting energy.  If you are truly worried, just ask her how she feels, or better yet, just ask what she might want or need and go from there when choosing a gift; not everyone needs 100% surprises.  My SIL just started college and we wanted to give her something special.  She decided to buy something for her dorm room, and asked us to reimburse her for it.  It might not be the wY I generally go about things, but it was what *she* wanted.",

I think talking with her would be the best way forward to start with",

It makes me know that you were thinking of me and put at least a small thought as to what I may enjoy. \n\n\nI suggest talking to your friend honestly and getting their opinion on how they feel. Just be honest with them about how you're feeling and that you want to know their feelings too. Then you can come to some sort of arrangement with a better understanding of each other.",
            "Have you spoken to her about this? My best friend is like this. I'm.... very much not. For years I just felt awful because she'd be sending me spectacular things. I would just send her little things I found that reminded me of her, but never anything extravagant or that I put a ton of thought into. Finally I spoke to her about what I felt was a horrendous quality discrepancy and her gifts being so much better than mine. She told me the gifts I give her are actually some of her most treasured possessions. \n\nBecause she loves gift giving so much, a lot of other people felt the same way and just... stopped giving her anything. Their logic being why bother, they can never compete with what she'd give them, as if it's a competition. And she just took it in stride because she's an angel of a human and honestly never expected anything in return for her gifts. Turns out though my little things wound up meaning a lot to her.  My trick is don't aim to buy for specific events. Just... go about life. And if you happen to be in Target and see a $3 teacup that's her favorite color or whatever, get it. Oh a little beanie baby at a thrift store that's the same breed as her dog? Perfect. \n\nHell sometimes receiving a box of tiny little things is way more fun than one huge present. So you can do something like that. A big box of assorted candies and silly fun toys is always a winner.",
            "So have you ever heard of the 5 love languages? This can translate even if you arent in a romantic relationship. Gift giving is a way she shows her love and its ok that that doesn't mesh up with your way. How do you like to show someone you live them? Maybe it's a dinner or quality time? Maybe it's that hug when you guys see each other after not for a few weeks or days. You don't have to give gifts to show you love her and appreciate her as a friend. Do it how it suits you. Be honest about it and I'm certain she will appreciate the way you show your love to her.",
            "I bet she has a running list. That\u2019s how I do it. I take note of every little thing a loved one says or mentions wanting and build a list of it. My husbands list has around 20 items on it at any given time and when Christmas or a birthday hits, I just have to choose from it. I do this for my parents, siblings, and in-laws. \n\nI\u2019d guess if your friend is like me she really enjoys giving the gift. Maybe consider continuing and either try the list idea for better gifts or just get comfortable with the fact that being an epic gift giver probably brings her a lot of joy and has very little to do with what she gets in return.",

            "Instead of exchanging gifts, my best friend and I exchange homemade cards for birthdays/Christmas with a letter inside. The cards are like a time capsule of our friendship, so we both try to include memories of the year and inside jokes that are relevant.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot more heartfelt than an elaborate gift, and also something meaningful that we both keep and look back on every once in a while.  \n\nWe also make each other \u201cfriendship\u201d cards - when one of us is feeling really down or going through something, the other will make a card to remind the other of all of the things we love and fond memories to cheer up the other.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly the most meaningful thing, and I can\u2019t recommend it enough. You\u2019re more likely to keep a card than a gift through the years - as we get older, I don\u2019t want stuff. Just tokens.\n\nMaybe suggest a similar exchange? Then your friend can use her loving gift giving energy, and you can spare yourself the stress?",
            "I\u2019ve been through a similar situation with my two best friends. One of them is just the world\u2019s best gift giver (A), and us other two (me and B) are struggling to keep up. Friend B talked to each of us separately about moving away from physical presents to experience-based ones. B and I now do that (nice dinners and massages are our new favorite activities together). \n\nHowever, one of friend A\u2019s primary love languages is gifts, so we compromised by getting her to send us lists of either specific items or categories of things she\u2019d like each birthday / holiday. Now, our primary \u201cgift\u201d is doing the research to find the perfect option for that category, instead of trying to guess what A has and doesn\u2019t have. \n\nIt\u2019s still some work / stress, but I respect that we each have different love languages and want to make sure she feels loved so am willing to put in the effort.",
            "Last year my friend group tried to transition into doing a secret santa but doing that really highlighted who cared about giving gifts and who didn't. I technically still haven't even received mine despite the fact I got the person I disliked the most but I gave them a hand painted picture frame that had her and my friend and their dog in it, plus some of her favorite candy, the lip balm she asked for, $5 Starbucks gift card, and wrapped in her favorite color. So this year we're simply doing nothing and we all acknowledge that any gift giving is not expected to be returned which I'm fine with, I like giving gifts and I honestly don't ever expect anything more than a thank you. That said it sounds like you've gotten great suggestions already about this friend and I think it's important to just be honest with her if you can't get her to compromise on giving you a gift. If I were you I'd tell her you have no problem accepting a gift if she insists but you'd prefer your gift to her in return be time spent together or a handmade card. Maybe you two can do a craft day and make items out of clay for each other or paint something? Good luck!",

But here\u2019s the thing I HATE RECEIVING GIFT, HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT. So when I had a few friends come\nup to me with this similar issues, I was so relieved! Most people whose love language is gift giving will completely understand where you\u2019re coming from and bc were so what at what we do we\u2019ll come up with other gifting ideas.

It works out perfectly and we both get to express our love in our special ways.",
            "Look into love languages. Mine is very much physical touch but my best friend is receiving gifts. I\u2019ve become a really strong gift giver because that\u2019s her way of feeling appreciated. My spouse is a words of affirmation person and I struggle to remember to do this when the physical touch is more filling to me. \n\nMy point is though that while my best friend would never expect gifts I know little things fill her cup so I do them for her and I never expect it in return because we have the relationship where we\u2019ve talked about love languages and how to help fulfill each other. Same with my spouse. I make reminders in my phone to tell him I appreciate him and I know he makes the effort to hug me more. It\u2019s not just for me, it\u2019s for the relationship. \n\nYou need to sit down and just tell her. I can see that gift giving/acts of service seem to be your way of expressing love. I love the detail you put into this but I\u2019m really more into quality time, is there a way we can combine these, so we are both feeling fulfilled?",

            "I think that what you want is very reasonable and makes sense. I'd also caution that even though you need a break, your friends love language won't change. For instance, my mother in law's love language is gift giving. One year on her birthday we had flowers delivered to her work and then picked her up from work and took her to dinner at a place she'd been dying to go. We had lovely time and spent a decent amount. The next day she expressed she was sad she didn't get a gift. \n\nShe enjoyed the time spent and the thoughtfulness but she really sees physical gifts that are wrapped as the ultimate expression of love.\n\nI would suggest that you have the talk with your friend but consider a compromise. Would they've ok telling you exactly what they'd like? Then all that's left to you is to wrap it nicely.  Alternatively, would they've happy with small presents that probably are very affordable but something they need?  I have found that with my mother in law, if I wrap up bath towels and other boring but needed things she's very happy. Alternatively wrapped gift cards work for her.  \n\nI absolutely am on your side when it comes to presents. I don't care. But I know that some people value gifts the way i value time spent. So, maybe something like making an itinerary of a day you'll spend together but presented as a present could be a compromise. Lastly, I don't believe presents need an equal value. If she loves to give big things let them. But don't stop putting in any effort. Just know effort put into time spent might not be as valued as effort into giving a smaller easier gift.",
            "I suggest you have a talk with her and see how she views receiving gifts and if it's the same as giving gifts. I'm making a reference to the five love languages, and I know we usually talk about romantic relationship but she is your best friend so this is still relevant. Maybe mention and clarify that you appreciate all the hard work she puts into giving gifts to you but you have trouble doing the same because that's not necessarily how you express love. She could keep doing it since she loves it but maybe make her understand that you might express your love differently (have different types of gifts, spending quality time during her bday, xmas, give random gifts when you think she will like something, etc) \n\nI don't know if you get what I mean haha",
            "I think the best idea for how to solve this was already up there (do something together instead of gift giving), but I wanna add my voice to the many thoughtful gift givers here:\n\nAlmost none of my friends are as good at gift giving. They just ask me what I want, give me their price range, I pick a thing, they put a nice postcard with it, and I'm absolutely happy with that. Or they just take me out to dinner, or the zoo. Or have a movie night with me for my birthday. It literally doesn't matter. I'm just happy that I get to be creative for them. They show their love in so many ways, this is one of mine.",
            "I would be honest with her; it sounds like she enjoys giving the gifts to you! I wouldn\u2019t stop her from doing it, just express to her that you really appreciate the gifts she gives you, but you express your love in other ways. Everyone has different ways to give/receive love. Let her know that you show your love in other ways, and you hope she is receiving your love.",

She would probably be fine with a keychain or a gag gift if your love language is clearly something else (and you put effort into THAT way of showing her you love her, which you probably already do) \n\nI don\u2019t think you should ask her to stop doing this, especially because she does it so well and it\u2019s her thing. I think you need to understand that you DONT have to measure up or compete. You are allowed to be different kinds of people and show love in different ways. Honestly I think it would hurt her feelings and take something away from her.",
            "I don\u2019t have advice to give on how to cease, but as someone who loves to make personalized detailed gifts like that, there is such joy in giving someone something you know speaks to a small part of them and makes them feel special. \n\nAbout twenty years ago I made an (ex-)bf a huge basket of Easter eggs in his teams colors, and wrote an inspirational quote from different sports legends on a piece of paper in each egg.

She doesn\u2019t care, her love language is giving gifts, not always receiving. She just enjoys the knowledge that she did something I loved.

I eventually just told the people I'm close with/in gift-giving proximity to the truth and asked if we could start doing experiences together instead of giving gifts and it's worked really really well!  Personally, no one has been anything but understanding and everyone has actually really liked that we're doing something together instead of exchanging gifts. For example - with my brother for birthdays etc we take the other out to a restaurant neither of us has been to (we're both into food), for the holidays with my family we do the white elephant gift thing and order lots of take away and just hang out, with friends maybe we go see a concert together, etc.",

I sometimes can successfully get out of the expensive gift exchange by suggesting a nice dinner out or a weekend away somewhere. I\u2019m not sure if this would work for you because it doesn\u2019t sound like her gifts are necessarily expensive but I\u2019ve also successfully negotiated price limits for Christmas with her. For me I\u2019m comfortable spending $50 but I don\u2019t want a $300 purse because I don\u2019t financially feel comfortable with that. My friend has been very open to suggestions when I make them as long as there is something commemorating the holiday or event.

            "As someone who often is the \u201cgreat gift giver\u201d I do encourage you to find a middle ground. I can totally understand that you\u2019re overwhelmed with the thoughtful gifts, but as you said, this is also her way of expressing that she cares about you. I imagine she doesn\u2019t need you to match her thoughtfulness in the same way, so maybe finding a way that you can each express your affection where you both get to play to your strengths is the answer. I would be honest with her and tell her how wonderful her gifts are, and share that you really genuinely appreciate them and what it means about your friendship but that, if it\u2019s okay with her, you\u2019ll show it in a different way. I recommend purchasing quality time experiences as her gift. Give her a card that says, \u201cI\u2019d like to take you out to this new restaurant to celebrate your birthday. Dinner is on me!\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m hosting a [insert her hobby or shared interest here] party in your honor\u201d, or \u201cMerry Christmas!

I do it because it makes me happy to make others happy. I don\u2019t need anything in return. If your friend is a close friend she will get it. Had one of my roommates told me they felt pressure to get gifts and wanted to stop, id say I\u2019m still giving you a gift but in return you can do something fun with me like go to dinner.

I tend to buy gifts way in advance not because it's an elaborate plan but because I see a thing and the thing reminds me of you and I just want you to know that you're thought about and loved. I don't care what I get in return. The smile on your face when you open it is my actual gift. \n\nI can say with all certainty that if you told me not to get you gifts, I would still give you gifts but just not give them to you on the holidays. Care packages are my jam. If I knew it stressed you out I would feel terrible but there are ways to get around it. I'm sure your friend already knows she's better at giving you gifts, why not be honest with her and just say hey, I love you, you give the bestest gifts and I feel like my gifts never measure up to yours. Can you help me and give me a list of things you'd like? Or set a spending limit. Just saying you can't afford to do gifts would not stop me from buying you something.  I always tell my friends I have zero expectations of reciprocation. They know it's just how I say I love you.   Jesus, I hope they all know. I'm going to go check in with my friends to make sure they aren't stressed about my gift giving.",
            "I love gift-giving. If my best friend told me not to get her a gift, I probably would still get it for her, because it's something I love doing, it's one of my love languages. I have been told to not give gifts before and honestly, I hate it, it's one of the few things I feel I'm really good at. A couple of years ago my best friend approached me she said, \"I love the gifts you give me so much, it stresses me out because I can never do you justice, would you consider making me a list of things you want, like the exact thing you want?\"  \n So all year anytime I want something, but I just can't pull the trigger to buy it, I add it to an Amazon wish list all year for her. I love board games so that's mostly what my list is these days, and I love it, I get something I really want, and she doesn't have to stress - most of the time she just has Amazon deliver it to me so she doesn't even have to wrap it.",

My local BFF and I only do birthday gifts and then my longtime best friend group only does a Secret Santa every year. It saves time and effort, but will still allow your friend to get you something! And if you can\u2019t find the perfect physical gift for her, something experiential is usually a hit! For example, getting mani/pedis together, going to a wine and paint night, concert tickets, etc.",
            "Why don't you do what the older people in my family do? There too many of us know and so many kids under 18. So now when you hit 18 you join the gift game.\n\nThere are only three rules \n1. You all agree to a low amount of \u00a35-\u00a310 that you HAVE to stick too.\n2. The gift has to be either weird or useless but always funny and silly, the more useless but amusing the better.\n3. Unless it's inappropriate (some have been a little none child friendly) you must use it at some point either at the party or post a pic showing you've used it if you're away for Christmas.\n\nIt's almost become a competition at this point and gives everyone a fun time gift shopping and a good laugh opening your gift.\n\nMy mum won last year by getting her brother a set of reusable, flashing ice cubes. That doesn't sound that fun but what he didn't know was that once you poured your drink in and they got wet each one played a tinny version of the tequila song on a loop often starting and ending at different times.

I hate the stress and the pressure - I think it's why I hate Christmas so much.  I would much prefer to spend time together or buy dinner or something.  My love language is quality time and giving/receiving gifts is my lowest ranked love language.  My brother is kind of like me too and we came to an agreement that we won't give gifts just b/c we have to but if we ever see something that the other would like, regardless what time of year it is, we'll buy it.

And I loved it! It was hilarious to be handed it in a nice restaurant while she was blushing furiously and crying laughter and it was beyond useful. There's no measuring between friends, it's entirely in your head.\n\nBut it's also fine to stop, too. We skipped last Christmas because she was too tight on funds, one year I gave nothing as I was too broke, some occasions we'll just have a movie night, one she made me a scavenger hunt, sometimes only one of us gifts. It's truly not a worry, just share the pressure with her and it'll all sort itself out.",
            "Can you gift her with experiences? Like a trip somewhere, the zoo, skydiving, a concert or music festival, a beer/wine tasting, a fancy restaurant, lessons in something she's interested in, go out for drinks, maybe tickets to a sports game or something? \n\nSince it means a lot to her, maybe tell her how amazing she is at gift giving and you can tell how much thought went into it. You may not be good at it yourself, but you always appreciate the thought she put into it.\n\nGift giving is definitely my love language. I get it. Some people just don't know what to get me, but it still makes me feel loved if they put a tiny bit of effort in to show they were thinking of me. Even favorite candy makes me happy. Some people put lists in their phone and add things your friend likes or mentions, their hobbies, favorite stores or sports teams, etc. It helps for Christmas and Birthdays and I know it can be very overwhelming to shop for gifts, so it's a good reference point. \n\nThe biggest thing for us is just wanting to see how happy and excited someone is when they receive their gift. It really is more about how happy we can make people. It we get a small reaction we feel kind of disappointed, like we didn't do well enough. You can tell her you don't want to do gifts this year, but she's definitely going to do something anyway, because you mean a lot to her. Neither of my sisters want to receive or give gifts and honestly, it makes me sad. Just do what is most comfortable for you but let your friend know how much you appreciate her thoughtful gifts.",
            "For me, I LOVE gift giving, but the act of wrapping gifts stresses me out to no end because I suck at it. Think easy to open for a toddler, but not purposely.

I so appreciate you and if you want to keep doing it, go for it, but can I instead offer to do x for Christmas with you instead?\" For x, if you are a \"quality time\" person like me, suggest some activity you can take her on around the holidays. There are tons of ways to show you care outside of gifts, and hopefully your friend will understand if you approach it from a place of love. It's clearly not about the money or the time, it's just not the way you like to operate. \n\nOne of my best friends is a very good gift giver. I like you am not. She still buys me gifts sometimes, I rarely get her gifts. But we're open about it and I do other things for her, like I will always make time to do whatever she wants for her birthday.

I often tell people who want to buy me gifts in return to get me gift cards for the movies, for fast food or coffee OR for my favorite big box craft store.  I don't need the same effort I put in but I love when someone is nice enough to give me a gift card so that on a bad day I can treat myself.\n\nIn the end, its better just to talk to her and come to a compromise or see what she has to say about it.",

I try and make up for it a bit with some really lovely cards to go with the gifts (I\u2019ll do cards with photos of us both on the front and make sure to write a really personal note) and I make a point of sending chocolates/flowers/books/wine to any friends who I know really communicate through gifts if they\u2019re sick or have some good or bad news. Someone else mentioned love languages, and I hope that when that\u2019s someone\u2019s love language the fact I send little gifts throughout the year makes them realise how much I value them even if I disappoint terrible for birthdays and Christmas! \n\nThere\u2019s been some great advice on this thread though - which I\u2019m definitely going to be incorporating.\n\nEdit - the lovely cards thing is an ongoing project cause you have to make sure you take a photo with them each time you meet up so you have something to put on the next card!!",

Some people genuinely just enjoy finding and giving the perfect gift. Getting the perfect gift in return might not even been something she is interested in.",

And she can use her creativity to find the most unique or underserved charity or ones that have particular meaning to you. It\u2019s a win-win for all involved. You may end up enjoying the process when it\u2019s for something so helpful.",
            "I'm a gift giver too and what my non-gift giver friends do is give me an experience in return. So we go to the zoo, or try something different or just hang out and they buy me dinner. I'm always happy with this because I know this is their way of showing me they love me.  Just like how I do it by giving special gifts.",
            "A group of friends and I did gift exchanges for years. I hated it because of the stress I felt to get a good gift for them. We even went so far as to create a shared Dropbox folder and putting lists of what we each wanted. Still hated the situation. I finally had a talk with everyone about how much it stressed me out. I told them I\u2019d rather just get together for a meal or something and hang out cause being around them was more important. And now that\u2019s how we do it.",
            "I\u2019m just like your friend and I think the best advice I could give you is to Be honest with her and tell her what you told us through your post. Just be prepared that she may continue to bring you gifts anyway because that\u2019s how crafty gift givers roll. It\u2019s not about a contest of who can give the most crafty creative gift. Literally people like us don\u2019t care if we get anything in return. We thrive on creativity and making others happy.",

At one point, I just pointed out that all we were doing was exchanging gift cards, none of our kids were kids anymore, and the best part of the holiday was being together. I let them know I would no longer be buying gifts, I truly preferred not to get any as well. After one somewhat awkward Christmas, it never came up a again. That was 10 years ago.",

            "So I am your friend. Meaning I act like her. If she is like me, her true joy is from bringing others joy with presents and receiving presents isn't as fun. Like I like it and all but if all the people who I buy gifts for assumes I am keeping score, that would break my heart. I buy gifts as an extension of my heart. Other people show me love in other ways. You get to choose how you express that love you feel for her. I would be legit surprised if she was mad you aren't as into gift giving as she is.",
            "Neither my fianc\u00e9 nor myself are great at present-giving, so for our anniversary, Valentine\u2019s Day, and some christmases, we both take the money we would have spent on our gifts and combine them to pay for an experience we plan together. Sometimes they\u2019re day trips, sometimes they\u2019re weekend trips, but they\u2019re always so much fun. It\u2019s much less stressful than trying to surprise someone with the perfect present because you get to have fun planning the trip together, and you get to share the experience together. I\u2019d suggest sharing your feelings with your friend about how stressful it is for you and how it makes you feel bad that you\u2019ll never be as good at it as she is, and you would much rather spend time making memories with her instead.",
            "Just tell her you cant \n\nSome people like this just like giving gifts, they dont except one in return always. \n\nSome years I do this for friends, some years I don't, some years they do, some they dont",

I\u2019ve already started buying Christmas presents and put a lot of thought into every present I give. Gift giving is also one of my love languages in terms of how I express love to those I care about, I think that might be the same for your friend. Have a talk with her because stopping gifts completely might mean cutting off a way she expresses love.",
            "Really great idea was mentioned and I agree.. spending time together instead of gifts..   A couple years ago my friend and her 2 daughters (around your age) agreed to this..  They go to the city, see theatre or just a nice dinner together instead of birthday gifts.  Last X-mas my side of the family agreed to 'no gifts'---  none of us need anything so we just get together and no gifts-- except for the younger kids.",

I\u2019d love to say \u201clet\u2019s do donations in each other\u2019s names this year\u201d instead of physical gifts, but I know that would hurt her feelings.",
            "Does she expect you to gift her back? I like gifting but don't mind if the person gets me a gift back (actually it can make me a little uncomfortable unless it's something simple and cheap). I would not like if a friend didn't want me to gift them because they felt obliged to give one back and would just want an honest conversation on the matter. If they told me they'd feel they had to give me a gift in return even if I had told them not to I would stop but my preference would be to keep giving gifts and they not give me gifts.",

Good reason to dump the tradition",

Only live and friendship. Tell them.",

I am sure she will understand... You can just gift her normal things like accessories, expensive self care creams etc.\n\nGift giving is about emotions. It doesn't matter what you give! Just tell her the same thing you've told us!! Trust me.",

            "I am disheartened by all of the comments telling you to just accept the gifts because it makes your friend happy. You don't want to receive gifts, that's your boundary. You shouldn't have to feel bad every Christmas and birthday, and accept behaviour you don't want, to keep the peace with an overbearing friend. \n\nAttention gift givers: It doesn't matter how much YOU want to give people things. If receiving your gifts makes people uncomfortable, you are NOT being as loving as you think you are. Loving people means respecting their boundaries, not forcing stuff on them to make yourself happy. That's manipulative. Gifts are meant to make the receiver happy, and if your giving makes them upset then you're not thinking of them at all, you're being selfish. \n\nImagine if the issue was hugging. Should you let people hug you even if it makes you uncomfortable, because hugging is their love language? Would any of you be telling OP to just submit to physical contact she doesn't want?\n\nOp, stick up for your boundaries. Tell your friend no more gifts.",

We had tons of amazing memories, we've traveled to several countries together and made long term work for 3 years while separated due to studies. (Though now I'm having trouble believing anything was real).\n\n\n\nLast Thursday I proposed to her in St Lucia, (Not in front of anyone mind you, I wanted it to just be private). She didn't say anything and I was thinking, oh shit, did I say or do something wrong? She started crying and said she had something to explain to me. She didn't want to marry me because she'd been sleeping with the co worker she said was 'just a friend' for around 3 months. \n\n\n\nShe said she rationalized it was just a thing that would pass but it's continued and she said she loves me so much, more than I'll ever understand, that I've helped her so much and she doesn't even know why she has done this. She said she loved me too much to marry me knowing she'd done what she did.\n\n\nShe doesn't love the guy, it was just sex and she had been trying to stop the affair but I proposed before that happened and she said she knew when I was kneeling that she couldn't marry me, not after everything I'd done for her, so she told me.\n\n\nI feel like my whole world has shattered. We had an awkward flight home on Friday evening and haven't spoken since. She has tried calling me but I haven't answered and I have until Monday off, so I'm just here.\n\n\nI've barely eaten, I feel like there's a black hole in my stomach draining everything I have mentally. I can't wrap my head around the fact that she was cheating, that she lied, that she hid it from me.\n\n\nMy sister apparently had some words for her. I'm trying to pretend I'm okay but I'm not. Every morning that I've woken up since last week Friday morning has just been bleak.\n\n\nI love her so much but I've no intentions of getting back together, I don't think I would ever be able to trust her again much less forgive her for a very long time. My best friend brought a six pack yesterday and we drank in the evening, I cried my eyes out in the shower last night. I never cry, not even when my mom who I was extremely close to passed away, but I was sobbing like a child last night and honestly I would have loved if my mom had been there to tell me it'd be okay.\n\n\nMy sister brought over some breakfast this morning and basically made me eat because she knows I haven't really been eating lately, zero appetite.\n\n\nAnyway, I'm sorry this post is so incoherent. Any tips for someone on how best to move forward and where to go from here? Because I've got nothing, no ideas, no clue. I feel like a zombie.\n\n\ntl;dr girlfriend of ten years admitted to cheating for the past several months when I proposed, we're done but I have no clue what to do now, my life revolved around this woman for over a decade, she was my rock and my everything and all that just died a little under a week ago",

            "This might sound harsh but I mean it with the best of intentions; be thankful that this all came to light when it did and not when you two were married. Use this time to explore life and indulge in your hobbies and interests. It's very painful when a loved one betrays us, but you need to remember that you have a very bright future in front of you, don't waste it on someone who doesn't/didn't respect you. Perhaps when you're feeling up for it, organise a nice night out with friends and family, try not to lock yourself in a room and dwell as that will only make you feel worse.",
            "This is a quote from a post long ago I saved... I hope it helps you.\n  \n> The fucked up thing is that this is great. Every bitter moment of disillusionment brings you closer to truth. In your case, it brings you out of a shitty relationship and leaves you open to being in a good one. \n\n> We cling to our old pain, we don't want it to go because we are attached to it, because we are afraid of an unknown future without it.\n\n> The truth is, when we do this do this we are clinging to an anchor that holds us at the bottom of the ocean. We are denying ourselves the growth we need.\n\n> There's absolutely nothing wrong with this. You are totally allowed to feel the pain, cry in the shower, get drunk and scream your rage at the God you don't believe in. Do that. Feel that pain, dive deep into it.\n\n> For about 72 hours. You have till Friday to wallow in self pity, tell everyone how unfair it all is, and bemoan the injustice of being treated so poorly by someone you treated so well.\n\n> But come Friday I want you to start thinking about how it's better to be without her. Realize that she is likely to always be like this, she probably isn't going to suddenly stop cheating on people, she isn't going to stop pulling shit like \"X has my permission to punch me in the face and blame it on you.\" \n\n> Instead of thinking how hard it is to not have been cherished the way you want and deserve to be, realize that it's much harder to go through life not able to love and cherish people. She used you, she's never going to be able to stop wondering if her next lover is using her. She lives in a world where deceit is a part of love, and you just got out of that world.\n\n> Think about that, you just got out of that world. Now you're free. Now you can find the next stage of your adventure. Maybe it will be the last stage, maybe it will be another false start, but it will be new and different. \n\n> Now you have an opportunity to redefine yourself. \"Hit the gym, throw yourself into your work, reconnect with your loved ones.\" Or, if you want a little less B.S., don't expect to be happy. Instead work on creating the causes and conditions for you to find happiness. Take care of yourself and the things you love, be interested in personal growth, and have a lot of fun. Eventually you'll lock eyes with a special someone, and then a few years later you'll laugh about how some ex of yours cheated on your for months, and it probably saved you a few years of a dysfunctional relationship.\n\n**I love you brother, you got this.**\n\n****edit - Original Author****  \n  https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/30mcl3/tifu_drinking_with_my_girlfriend/cptxtmr",
            "Hey man, I went through something similar last year, and I can assure you things will get better. It hurts right now, and its totally understandable to feel lost, you're gonna feel like that, and you're going to feel all sorts of emotions in the time to come, you can't fight it, and you can't beat yourself up over what happened it wasn't your fault. \n\nWhen I was in your position I moved on autopilot, I kept my routine, I ate when I had to eat because I had to focus on something, I did work when I had to, and I reached out to my friends, especially when I felt like I didn't want to be around anyone, I'd call them, or text them, just something to get my feelings out and know that my friends had my back. Do that, reach out to your friends, lean on them, and talk with them about anything. \n\nIts kind of funny, I mean it hurts right now, but in time you will see that this heartache you feel right now is just the beginning of a new adventure for you. \n\nYou will be just fine, and you will get through this.

Stay in touch with friends and family that care about you. Don't isolate yourself.\n\nPick up a hobby. Stay active. \n\nAnd finally, let go of any contact with your ex. Block social media, delete her number, etc. Allow yourself to move on.",
            "Firstly, I'm so sorry to hear this and I can't imagine how you're feeling. You have to take things one day at a time. This must be a huge shock and so it's really important that you look after yourself at this time. You need to get up, shower every day and try and eat food to keep yourself healthy. Also, drink some tea, it's a surprise how much a cup of tea can be like a warm hug. As much as what you probably don't want to, you need to do this. What kind of financial situation are you in? Can you look at getting a new apartment? You need a fresh start and staying in the home you lived in together is not a wise idea. You need newness and a place that isn't filled with memories. Set yourself daily tasks i.e. today look at two new apartments. You need to tread slowly as this is such a traumatic time but slowly building yourself up to this is a good idea. You will be ok. You will get through this. One of my favourite quotes is, 'if you're going through hell, keep going'. You will find your happiness and the happiness you deserve. Where is Carrie staying at the moment? Could you have your sister or best friend pack up her stuff so at least in the interim it's all removed from your house and you don't have reminders or alternatively, because she's the one that did this horrific thing, could you stay somewhere with your best friend or sister and leave her to figure out the apartment? If not, I would move your mattress to your lounge room, just to stay out of your bedroom. Silly I know, but little things like this help. Again, I'm so sorry to hear this has happened. Sending you lots of strength at this time! ",
            "The best advice I have for you is, that it will suck for a while, but eventually, you'll get over her, meet someone else, marry and be glad you found her. Your ex will just become the girl you once loved that fucked you over. Have zero contact with her. Closure is a myth, and is overrated. Cut her out of your life immediately. Lean on your friends and family for support. Think about seeing a counselor. Get busy doing things that make you happy. Go be selfish for a while. Hit the gym, take up new hobbies. Get active. Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'. ",

            "This comment will get down-voted to non-existence, but it appears it is still taboo on these types of threads.\n\nYou don't *have* to throw away those 10 years. Marriages and relationships have been known to survive affairs. \n\nFrankly, the fact that she felt the need to tell you, so much that she couldn't hold it back, the moment you proposed, is a sign of some level of character that is worth noting.\n\nMost redditors will say \"once a cheater, always a cheater\" but really there are degrees of cheating and this fact is lost on the hivemind.\n\nThere *is* a difference between your girlfriend (not wife) having an affair with a co-worker and your fiance blowing the best man, behind the barn, during your wedding reception.\n\nThere is a great deal of info out there on how extramarital affairs have been overcome, and how some people have reported them as improving a relationship in the long term. Just google \"can a couple overcome an extramarital affair\"...\n\nI agree that total cut-off is appropriate right now. For at least a couple of weeks. But if *you* feel, deep down, like you actually think this woman can learn from her mistake, and if *she* wants to try to re-build your trust and respect, then I think anything is possible.\n\nThere may be conditions you have to impose on her... for example, leaving the job where that guy works. I think that is reasonable (as is, obviously, cutting off all contact with him, for-absolutely-fucking-ever).\n\nBut keep in mind that, going forward... *if* you want to try to rebuild your life with her, then one day you would have to forgive her. If you want her to work on rebuilding your respect, you also have to refrain from hitting her over the head with this \"you cheated!\" stick for the rest of your lives.\n\nJust think about it. Reddit will tell you that if she doesn't lose you, she didn't learn her lesson. I don't believe that is always true.\n\nEDIT: I wrote something unclear \"one day you really do have to forgive her\" above. It should say \"*if* you want to try to rebuild your life with her, then one day you would have to forgive her\". (Never-forgiving is definitely an option, and would be be perfectly fair in this case.... but it is not an option if he and she want to try to overcome this affair). I have edited in-place too.\n",
            "I am you from the future, here to tell you that everything will be OK.\n\nI am 33.  About 8 years ago, I went through a very similar thing.  Found out my long-term GF had cheated on me multiple times over the course of the last year or so of our 5+ year relationship (though, in my case, the GF didn't volunteer the info, it came out unexpectedly).  I was shattered.\n\nI remember feeling a lot of the same emotions you've described: the black hole in the stomach, the confusion, the pain, and the feeling of being lost -- not knowing how to move on or even which direction was up.  It was utterly disorienting.\n\nI remember knowing logically that I had to break up and move on, but not knowing how to do that.  Not knowing how to live my life without her.  As you said, you've built your life around her.  I remember also, in low times after the breakup, considering reaching out to her, but I never did.\n\nI never spoke to her again after that.  At first, I took some time and focused on me.  It helped that I was in grad school at the time, but whatever career/schooling you are pursuing right now, just dive in.  Gradually, I began seeing other women, but for 2+ years, I never got serious or emotionally invested with anyone.  Feel free to have a series of flings, when you are ready.  \n\nIn a way, I was shut off from the world, emotionally.  Now, I think it's okay to do this, maybe even necessary, after such a trauma.  But this part is important, -- as you're floating adrift, DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE SHORE.  Don't succumb to the notion that all women are rotten, or all relationships are doomed.  You are a sensitive, caring, and thoughtful person, and you've been hurt by someone who should have been in your corner.  But don't let that blind you to your own sensitivity and kindness.  Eventually, after focusing on yourself for awhile, you're going to want to step foot back on the land and give things another try, so you'll need to keep that part of you alive.  Just protect it for awhile.  There are women out there who are deserving of it, and will reciprocate it.\n\nEventually, you'll look back on this relationship with some regrets -- you'll wish you hadn't \"wasted\" so much time with this girl, etc.  But it will no longer be crippling or debilitating.  You'll move on to better things.  As someone else said in the comments, you're now free of this world where relationships are based on deceit and mistrust.  You're young, and you've got so much life ahead of you.\n\nI have now been married for 2 years to the most loving and caring woman I've ever been with.  I couldn't imagine spending my life with anyone else.  ",

            "Hey brother, I know a ton of people has told you this, but you need to trust us on this one: it will get better. I went through a breakup with my high school sweetheart 4 weeks ago. I've known her for 10 years, dated for 7. We were even engaged the last one month of the relationship. But she broke up with me, for reasons I'm still trying to come to terms with. Don't try to repress your feelings - anger, frustration, sadness, emptiness - feel them all. Cry in the shower if you need to. Scream at the top of your lungs if you need to. Don't pretend to be okay. Nothing wrong with showing weakness. We're all humans after all. I'm so sorry you have to go through this, but I know you'll get through this. Spend time with family and friends. Grab drinks. Play pool. Drive around with friend. Overtime, the time you spent with your ex will be good memories that you can smile back on. You're  still 22, plenty of time to explore yourself and the world. Good luck pal, PM me if you need anything. ",

            "Hey man,\n\nJust wanted to say that I really don't have any earth shattering advice, because honestly, there is none at this point in time. My SO and I of 8 years ended our relationship out of the blue a few years ago. She told me that she didn't love me any more. Every single thing you have described I have been though. I cried in the shower, I cried before i went to bed, and i cried i the morning when I woke up. Keep in mind... I don't cry, ever... This was a new experience for me. Once the crying stopped I felt the dark lingering emptiness weighing me down everywhere I went. It was terrible. All I wanted to do was talk about her, the breakup, how miserable i felt. Eventually though, your friends get tired of hearing the same shit over and over so you're left by yourself in bed at night with your own thoughts. This went on for MONTHS. Along with loosing 15 lbs, I also lost all motivation to do anything, including school work. Yeah... I was going to school at a very expensive university and I couldn't even find the motivation to go to class. That was my low point. Once that happened i realized I hit rock bottom. One day I got up, got dressed, and went straight to the University Councillor's office and made an appointment. I ended up seeing this lady for 3 months, and she helped me get my shit together. It helped a bit, and i was at least able to start going to lecture again. She told me to start working out, so I did, and it helped. She told me to go out and get a new haircut, get some new clothes, so I did. She told me to learn how to cook. I didn't have any motivation to eat still at this point, but I did it anyway. Basically all these things were to get her off my mind, and to find some new things I've never done with her before, and to start liking myself again.\n\nAnyway, not really sure why I posted, besides letting you know that I don't wish this sort of long term breakup on my worst enemy, and that there's always people here that can relate and talk to. I wish you all the best man. ",

Smoke some weed, start a monthly autodraft to your savings account based on how much you spent on her and see how fast it adds up! Buy a video game and eat a bunch of pizza. Try skydiving... that will really give you a new perspective... join a gym! But most importantly WATCH SPAGHETTI WESTERNS, LISTEN TO WARREN G and GET THAT DICK WET! the rest will come out in the wash.\n\nEnjoy life man... remember that relationships evolve, you are not with the same person and you are (likely) not the same person. Regardless of the person, they will change but the face stays the same. It doesn't matter who you spend life with, just be sure that it is with someone worth your time - this is all we have.\n\n(Are you rich and was she really hot? - just stick with the playboy lifestyle for a while lol)",

Wake up in the morning and, if you need it, have a good cry.  Limit yourself to less then 10 minutes and then get on with the rest of your day.  Rinse and repeat as needed.\n\nSo a byproduct of being mentally depressed with be physical depression.  In a sense, the lack of appetite isn't a terrible thing.  Your metabolism is gonna slow and you really don't want to come out of this breakup 50 pounds overweight.  That said, DO EAT.  Just be conscious about it.  If you don't already belong to one, join a gym.  Make a schedule and STICK TO IT.  The exercise will give your endorphin level a boost and make you feel better.  And if you're having a hard time finding motivation, use the massive quantities of anger that will start to manifest itself over the next few weeks.\n\nThe ABSOLUTE most important thing to remember here is:  **Do not let this experience define you as a person in your future interactions and relationships.**  Just because one woman cheated on you does not mean that the gender as a whole is dishonest.  Don't become bitter.  And just because she cheated on you does not mean that you somehow failed to live up to some unspoken bond between you.  A person's action towards you, whether good or bad, are 99% of the time based on who THEY are as a person, not who you are.\n\nWhether you decide to get speak to Carrie again or not, you need to forgive her.  This is not for her benefit, but for yours.  I'm not suggesting that you take her back or anything like that - I'm just saying that you need to recognize that she made a mistake and knows that she hurt you.  Hell, you don't even have to tell her you forgive her, just make sure you know it in your mind.\n\nAnd as for wondering if the last ten years was a lie... bullshit.  Just because she fucked up doesn't mean that she was playing some long con on you.  The fact that she came clean about it means that she cares and respects you enough not to lie about something so important.  That doesn't change the fact that what she did makes her a total twat-waffle, but it does mean that the entirety of the last ten years was not a lie.\n\nYou're only 27.  Life isn't over.

You need to take some time to grieve for the end of this part of your life. Watch your favourite movies, drink your favourite beer, eat all your favourite foods, just indulge yourself. Do something small and mindless like put together a puzzle, or pick up a colouring book and crayons, just something relaxing. It's ok to be miserable for a while, it's inevitable when something like this comes to an end.\n\nThe important part is that at the end of say, a week, you pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and realize that you WILL be ok.

All you can do is start focusing on yourself. Work out, go out with friends and do anything that you enjoy and makes you happy. It is ok to grieve for a day or two but the worse thing you can do is isolate yourself and push everyone away.

Truth was, I learned more about myself and what I wanted out of life and relationships from that experience, and the years that followed, than I could have ever learned otherwise. \n\nI moved away -- 1,000 miles to New York, where I didn't know a single person, and I went from there. I met new friends, tried new things, and learned to enjoy life without that crutch of being in a relationship. \n\nAnd a few years later, when I absolutely least expected it - when I was truly happy just enjoying my 20s with my friends, I met this girl that turned me upside down. And she was so different from what I thought I had wanted when I was in that defunct early relationship. \n\nSo what do you do? Make yourself get out of bed. Start there.

Go workout, go out with friends you've made excuses not to go out with (be responsible though and have plans for a driver), try new things (rock climbing is an activity that takes physical exertion and problem solving, it is very challenging but very rewarding and the people at rock gyms are incredibly nice and helpful.) Give it a try, give a lot of things a try. This creates quality time with yourself, seeing what you like. What you don't. Gives an opportunity to self reflect, learn and grow. \n\nFinally, the last part is learning to trust yourself again. Admittedly I'm still working on this, but I'm not worrying about it not happening anymore. You may not trust your own taste in women, you may try to analyze what in your ex you missed that caused this pain. THIS IS NORMAL, and something you'll have too look into for yourself when it happens. Just know that just because this happened in this case doesn't mean your taste in women will lead to this pain. \n\nThere's no specific right way to cope. Everyone is different, but there are destructive ways in trying to cope. Love yourself enough to recognize if what you start doing is not healthy. \n\nOp, you sound like a really genuine guy, and some girl will be lucky to meet you someday. This process is a good chance to focus on making yourself better for yourself, and in that process, someone someday will be so thankful you did. But more importantly, you'll be thankful you did.\n\n",

I've been pretty much exactly where you are now- proposal, confession of cheating, breakup... and unfortunately, there's nothing anybody could do or say to make it hurt less.  It just didn't work that way.  But, in time, you start to think about it less, and less, and less.  Until you get your life back.  \n\nThat is an inevitability.  There's nothing anybody can say to make this hurt less right now, but please know you WILL NOT always feel this way.  Guaranteed, this will stop.  Takes a while, but it will stop.

My advice may seem harder to do, but I think it's the right thing to do to protect your heart and your future - stay single for a while. Don't try to get someone to fill that void because it won't work out. It's not fair to you or that person. As people have said, working out, etc is all good advice. Take care of yourself. Ride it out by diverting your attention elsewhere. And definitely go no contact. There is no magic bullet - we've all been there in some form or another.

There are people in your life who do thanklessly care and love you and DON'T go around behind your back hurting you. There are also plenty more out there who will do the same. You need to rebuild yourself to the point of trusting and loving others before you can get back into a relationship otherwise you may salt your own wounds.\n\nProlonged contact with her will also reset your pain. Every time you hear her out you are reliving the experience and putting yourself through hurt again, which will only draw out the recovery that much longer.

You want excitement and those highs of a new relationship..but love is king..How do you hold onto both? Your gf did not know. She tried a new relationship to feel those exciting, unexpected, new and fresh feelings you get. It's a wonderful high that makes you feel like the world is right and great and everything is better or getting better. But it's a feeling. It's great but depth is what lasts.

If she hasn't already dropped the other guy completely realizing her mistake, leave her. She's still holding onto her options which is selfish.\n\n2.

            "I had something similar happen to me. We were together ~7 years, although there was no proposal. I went home to visit my parents for Thanksgiving and she told me I should just stay there. Turned out she found some other fella. \n\nMy situation was different in that I moved to live with her during college, about 5 hours from home. Luckily I had already graduated by the time this went down. I had to move back home, had no job lined up, no real idea of what I was going to do. \n\nI'm not a super emotional person. I was able to process it logically pretty shortly after it happened. Sure, she wanted to split, but there are billions of women in the world. I don't believe in \"the one\" or soulmates, anything like that. So you look at the relationship for how it really was. There are always negatives and positives. For the purposes of getting over a relationship, it's easier to focus on the negatives. When you've gotten over the initial shock and sadness, it's pretty easy to readjust and do things you enjoy for yourself. Embrace the freedom you'll have for the next little bit before you inevitably find someone else who will likely be better for you in the end than someone you met when you were 12.\n\nPeople change as they grow, especially from preteen to adult. Now is your time to really figure out what you want without worrying about someone else's feelings. It's not really that bad. You'll miss her now and again, but if you're keeping busy, it will go away pretty quickly.\n\nI still talk to my ex now and again, and we're friendly, but I almost never think of her at all. Like, even that she exists. She's just not a factor in anything I do. I ended up finding and marrying someone who is much better for me. We have three kids, a house, pets. Life is good.\n\nDon't focus on the sadness, don't focus on what you miss. Focus on having fun for yourself, and when you think of her, think of all the annoying bits of her for now.",
            "Hi, this might be a long shot in the dark and can potentially be quite triggering since wording is a bit dodgy (I know it was for me) but there's a really interesting podcast on why people cheat and sometimes without any particular reason. It's an episode on Sex Nerd Sandra called cheating, I would recommend listening to this\n\nThis is an unpopular perspective and I am going to suggest it since you described your relationship in a positive way prior to this occasion. It's important to consider especially since you guys have been together for a decade and you were planning on spending the rest of your lives together. \n\nSometimes people just fuck up and make stupid mistakes. There is no doubt she betrayed you. The mistake she made was not communicating her desires with you as they arised and being misled by lust instead. So the red flag here is the lack of open communication .. Why did she not feel safe enough in the relationship to voice her attractions towards this co-worker, what environment do you both create when you discuss potentially hurtful fantasies and scenarios? If you listen to the podcast it will clarify it a little bit better.\n\nI'm terribly afraid of being cheated on and it's easy to demonize those who have and I thought that I would have zero tolerance for it always, but the podcast has cleared up some myths and made me more accepting towards the possibility and less anxious.\n\nMy granparents are the most in love couple/team I know, together from the age of 21 to now in their 70s.

            "First of all, I don't know you. But I just wanna give you a huge right now. I feel for you. I feel the pain that you're currently feeling right now. The pit inside your stomach, the void in your heart, that lump on your throat when you swallow. Surrounded by darkness, you feel helpless, you feel betrayed, you feel like you just want everything to be normal again. Let me tell you right now, it won't be the same again. \n\nPick up a vase, raise it, drop it. It shatters. Of course it's possible to reconstruct it, but it will never be the same again. We will be broken, we will have insecurities, we will have doubts. And this is all because of what has happened to us. But that vase, if rebuilt properly, will always be able to carry flowers, just like before.\n\nThis is an internal struggle we, the *cheatee*, have to go through. I've been in your position, but I guess yours is so much more to endure than mine. I loved this girl and we were together for 6 years. She went to Canada as an exchange student and she never came back. Eventually, I learned that she cheated on me while she was there. No closure.\n\nI was lost. I didn't eat, sleep, work. I couldn't function like a normal human being. I cry every hour, even at work. It was the most painful thing I've ever experienced in my life. I just wanted everything to be right, but, it just takes time.\n\nI love the fact that you have no intentions of getting back with her. It might be the popular saying in this subreddit but \"cheaters will always be cheaters\". They were capable of it before, who says they couldn't do it again?\n\nHere are some things I suggest you to do: \n\n* Remove her from your life. If you live together, get a new place of your own. Somewhere far from where she is. Anything that reminds you of her, get rid of it. Save up for the things you have to replace. **DO NOT STALK HER**\n\n\n* Surround yourself with friends and family. They're the best and they will always be there for you. I cried to my parents when this happened to me and they were always there whenever I needed them.\n\n* Grieve. Cry your heart out. Sing to your favorite songs while tears fall down your face. Blame the world for all its bullshit and hate the fact that shit has happened to you. \n\n* Hate your ex for cheating, hate the guy she had an affair with. Make yourself feel better because right now, we are not concerned about them. We are concerned about you and what makes you happy. \n\n* You will feel lonely. You will miss the intimacy that you had with your ex. It is normal. The feeling of being a single guy will be foreign - but man, learn love yourself. This is the fastest way to recovery. \n\n* Start working out if you don't, you feel amazing. /Subscribe to /r/fitness now. Or do something new, get a hobby.\n\nRecovery will not be easy. It will take time and a little bit of brainwashing. But for me, the most important part of all is forgiving. You forgive not because you want to, but because you need your peace. Forgiveness cannot happen immediately - you cannot force yourself to forgive someone - it will just come naturally. Forgive because you need your peace.  Cherish all the good things that happened in your relationship, re-evaluate everything, and learn from your mistakes if you have any.\n\nClose the chapter of your life with her and start a new one, eventually with someone.\n\nI broke up with my ex April 2012 through e-mail because I needed to have my closure. I worked on myself for 5 months, then I started dating this new girl who was perfect for me. The new girl and I were together for a couple of years until we decided that it wasn't working out... What I'm trying to say is that, there will be people out there man. You just have to stay strong and find the good in life. PM me if you need someone to talk to.",
            "I'm sorry this happened to you. Take time to grieve. Keep up your health. Try to go out and enjoy the sunshine. \n\nThink of it this way: what if she had said yes, married you, have kids, then come clean. She didn't love you enough to refrain from cheating on you. Thank the stars you found out this truth early enough not to have bought a house, have kids, etc.,together. \n\nI'm sorry this happened to you. ",
            "I'm sorry this happened to you. Breakups are brutal, and this one especially so. The advice I'm about to give you is something I've realized after a few painful breakups. I've posted it on reddit before and I feel like it might help.\n\nEveryone is constantly imagining their own future - where they'll live, what they'll be doing, what kind of car they'll drive, who their friends will be, what kind of hobbies they'll have, if they'll own a dog or not, the dog's name, etc. Every slight variation creates a different potential future. An infinite number of potential \"future-yous.\" The longer you're with someone the more of your envisioned potential futures they occupy. In your case, having been with this girl for ten years, she was probably the anchor point in damn near every potential future you envisioned for yourself.\n\nMost of those futures probably involved the job you've got and the city you're in. Some of them might have involved a new career, another round of school, a new city, maybe a new hobby, a pet, an extended road trip, or any one of a million other things - you daydream about a subtly different potential future hundreds of times a day, I'm sure. But there was one consistent thread through all of those futures you envisioned: she was there. \n\nShe would be there to help you move. She would be there to encourage you when your new job got hard. She would take your new dog for walks, she would take a painting class with you, and she would take shifts driving on your road trip.\n\nWhen she cheated on you she took all those \"future yous\" and killed them. They can't exist as you imagined without her, and now you can't envision yourself doing anything at all because no matter what you thought was going to happen to you, you knew she was going to be there. When she left she killed all of your envisioned future-selves and now you don't see any future for yourself at all. It's crushing.\n\nYou're mourning the future you thought you'd have. \n\nSo what you need to do now is start making plans - create new future-selves. It doesn't have to be a grand scheme or a long term plan. Maybe you sign up for a dance class, or a gym membership, or write a short story, or even something as simple as buying a new sweater. These little things will help you see a future for yourself, even one as near-term as waking up tomorrow. It's going to take time to fully repopulate your stock of potential future-yous, but eventually you'll have just as many as you did before the break and you'll find many of them are just as good, if not better, than the ones you envisioned with her. \n\nSorry to tell you man, but it's gonna suck for a while. Rub a little time on it though, and one day you'll wake up and you won't think about her, or you will but it just won't hurt so much. Good luck. ",
            "I'll buck the trend and suggest you both try to work on the relationship. It was obviously good enough you wanted it to be permanent. She obviously loved you enough to not keep lying to you. Too many people throw away something that could be great because of mistakes that can be fixed. We're all flawed, we all make irrational and sometimes devastating mistakes, and we can heal from them and build something better. I know I've been there and come through it. Don't let yourself or the woman you love go through a lifetime of what-could-have-been and guilt and remorse. Take time for yourself. Think about what you want out of life and then talk to her about whether she can honestly provide that and what steps you both can take to get there. ",

            "You dodged a tremendous bullet, and honestly it is incredibly fortunate that she had the wherewithal to do the right thing and not hide her wrongdoing from you in that moment. I'm sure the guilt overcame her and she realized how much she'd hurt you by trying to hide it longer, which doesn't in any way excuse her infidelity, but it shows at least that she knew to do the right thing before it was too late. For that, you're lucky.\n\nI'm sure you're absolutely gutted right now, and understandably so. It's going to be hard. There are going to be nights you want to take her back, there are going to be nights you want to murder her, there are going to be nights you wish you'd never met her, there are going to be nights you want to go and fuck every other girl on the planet. But in between those bad nights will be days that get easier, days that start to feel okay. You'll hang out with friends more, you'll pick up a new hobby, you'll find yourself thinking of her less and less, you'll begin to feel like you again. \n\nSure, it won't be a steady uphill climb. You'll have setback days and nights. There will be times you'll feel like you took a step forward and then three steps back. That is natural. It's part of the healing process. What you need to focus on right now is you. Work on making you the best version of yourself. Not for her. Not for the next girl. For you. Be the man that your mother would have been proud of, because she wouldn't want to see her son kept down by the girl who cheated on him. You have the ability to take a horrible heartbreak into the best thing that ever happened to you in the long run. It won't be easy, but it will be worth it. \n\nIf there's ever been a more solid piece of advice for me to give people in your situation, it's been this: one day at a time. Don't give the bad days a lot of weight, don't let the good days make you think you're prematurely out of the woods. If a day goes well, great! Try to keep that positive momentum. If a day goes badly, it's over and done with, now tomorrow is a fresh start. You take that approach every single day and before you know it you'll be in the next great stage of your life and this will be a healed wound that you grew stronger because of. \n\nGood luck OP, all the best.",

In my experience, the only guaranteed thing that will help you heal from this, is time.  I know you just want the pain to end, I can only imagine how unbearable this whole thing feels.  But try to think about it like a broken leg.  It doesn't heal overnight, or in a couple days.  It takes time.  You have to not give up and keep going.  Though unlike a broken leg, a doctor can't just give you medicine to numb the pain.  That's something you have to do on your own.  The best painkillers for heartbreak in my experience are the cliches:  \n\nIf you aren't already, start working out.  Run, lift weights, start playing hockey, whatever.  For me, especially when I'm down, working out is one of those weird things where i REALLY don't want to do it, but then once I do workout, I'm REALLY glad I did it.  Plus, if you keep it up, then you get jacked, which is pretty awesome.\n\nHang out with your friends as much as possible.  Even hang out with ones that will let you complain about the ex over and over.  While it's counterproductive to dwell, healthy venting is a good thing.  But also try to laugh and have fun with them as much as you can.  Personally, I avoid booze in these situations, as it tends to be a guaranteed formula for \"miss my ex\", but in some cases drinking with friends can be great.\n\nDive into your hobbies even more, or add some new ones to your already impressive collection of hobbies.  It's hard to be sad about your ex when you just finished building a muscle car in your garage.  Or finally perfected that martial arts move you've been working on.  Or playing the new Fallout.  Or discovering a new kickass recipe to try in the kitchen.  \n\nTurn up the focus at work.  We all get bored at our jobs sometimes and that's prime think about the ex and get sad and unmotivated time.  So you need to do your best to not let that happen.  Challenge yourself to pick up the pace at work and not only will you avoid thinking about your totally lame ex (who is in fact, totally lame) but you'll also look like an even more badass employee.  \n\nFinally, avoid social media, or at least block/hide she who shall not be named from appearing in any kind of feed or whatever.  Nothing ruins a kickass day than suddenly seeing your ex had a rough day, but is happy she went to Bill's Badass Subs for lunch and oh my god you guys used to go to Bill's all the time and she hates pickles but would always get one on the side because she knew you liked them and OH SHIT YOU'RE SAD NOW.  So yeah, make sure that shit doesn't happen.\n\nIt fucking sucks.  Massively.  It's like a kick to the nuts every 5 minutes.  It feels like it will never end.  And it won't unless you move forward.  That's how you get to the light at the end of the tunnel.  Move forward.  Even if it's an inch or a millimeter at a time, you will make it eventually.  ",

Booze makes you sloppy and likely to do something stupid. If you do get hammered do it  with people who will keep you in line.\n\n* Hit the gym. Seriously.

Ten years and knowing someone from age 12 is way too long to be dating because you've grown so much as people. No one is the same near 30 as they were near 20. I'm more surprised you didn't cheat too - variety is the spice of youth!\n\nIf you two truly love each other, start over. DON'T MARRY but do try dating again. Maybe a new start. See if you like each other as truly honest adults ",
            "OK.  The first step here will be the most emotionally wrenching, but it also has the potential to add the most value to your life in the future.\n\nSit down and write all your feelings down in a letter to yourself (or address it to your mom).  Write down how much you hurt, write down how much you wish your mom was here to help, write down everything you are thinking and feeling.  Be as rambling as you want to be, just include everything.  When my wife cheated on me my letter was 14 pages long.\n\nTake the letter and put it in a safe space where no one will ever find it (I used my safe deposit box).  The reason this letter exists is for months from now, you'll have forgotten what this feels like.  It's human nature not to hold onto negative emotions or it makes us crazy, the side effect of that is that we often make the same bad choices over and over.  Some day in the future you are going to want to get back together with her.  Before you make any choice about any kind of relationship with this girl, you read this letter. \n\nI also found that writing all my feelings down made me feel a lot better.  As if I had a long talk with someone and got all my negitive feelings out.  I still had them, but I felt better for having communicated them, even if it was not going to be read by another human. \n\nSo the letter is step 1.  Step 2 is adjusting your lifestyle to fit a new template.  Find something in your life to change.  For me that was changing apartments.  I then decorated the new place to my tastes alone (the first time I've ever had a space of my own).  I know that might not be the answer for you, but find something concrete that you can change and live with every day.\n\nSince it's easier to make big life changes when things are already disrupted, this is also the time to change eating or exercise habits (if that's a problem for you).  You're building new life patterns anyway, so they might as well be healthy ones. \n\nObviously don't contact your Ex.  You don't have kids of anything so you can go \"no contact\" and it's easy. ",
            "People go through massive changes between 17-27. No relationship SHOULD last throughout those years.

I think most adults have been through something like this, although probably not as painful as your experience was.\n\nYou are probably feeling betrayed, and for good reason, because you were. I was once betrayed in a similar way, and felt terrible for about a week. What got me out of my funk was working out. It may not help you, but all the sudden I got addicted to improving myself, maybe because I thought that if I had been better that I wouldn't have been betrayed like I was. But whatever the reason, it did wonders for me.\n\nI began to regain my confidence, and soon the thought of my ex sort of just brought me contempt and disgust, whereas before I just thought she was the most wonderful person but I was really just looking through rose-tinted glasses. I started to become really productive and happy, and came to realize that I must not have actually been that happy while in a relationship.\n\nAbout a year later, I met another girl who I have been with for 3 years now. I know she is a good person and I have complete confidence that she would never betray me like that.

While I don't know details, it is highly likely she was not the first or only one.\n\nHow to move forward and where to go from here?\n\nTurn to your family and friends and let them support you. Allow yourself to grieve the relationship you thought you had and the future you thought you were planning. It's okay to feel like a zombie. It's okay to cry. Whatever you're feeling or not feeling is okay right now. \n\nTake some time to focus on you. What you need to process this might be different than someone else.\n\nTry not to stop living your life while you're at it. Get up, get out of the house. Even if you feel like you're just going through the motions right now. I found keeping busy provided much needed distraction.\n\nI do recommend changing your surroundings, even if that just means rearranging the furniture a bit. Personally, I cleaned out all of my closets, donated a bunch of old clothes, and rearranged the bedroom furniture. For me, moving on also meant deleting (or at least quarantining) old photos of us together. For the most part, I sanitized my life of as many reminders as possible of him. That may or may not be the right move for you, so take it for what it is.\n\nFor months afterward, I would face bouts of crying. At first randomly, then when specific reminders popped up, but then not at all. Time will fade the sting if you let it, but don't rush the process, either. I still find myself mentally lecturing him sometimes. What did I say when it happened? What could I say to him? I indulge for a few minutes (it used to be more...), but then make myself drop it. There's nothing left for us to say to each other. \n\nLimiting contact with her is important while you try to figure this all out. You may need to interact with each other in the process of separating out 10 years together, but keep it to a bare minimum. Time also gives perspective if you let it.\n\nI know it probably doesn't feel like it right now, but you can get through this and come out the other side stronger and wiser. ",

            "People like to tell their own stories in threads like this in hopes that it will make you feel better, or atleast not alone. You are truly not alone. I'll try to be short with my story: I was turned away from a sold out concert, only after ingesting a ton of \"magic\" mushrooms from a friend thinking we were getting in. (Yes, I went through a phase in college) My buddies and I were forced to come home about 4 hours early and I found my 5-year girlfriend (8+ year friend) on a date with another guy and followed them to his house, while tripping balls. Bad trip/relationship freakout/bad breakup ensued. It truly turned me DARK inside to know someone who loved me would do that to me. For atleast 16-24 months I'd feel the darkness approach, come over me, and recede each day. I can vouch, with every passing week/month it gets a little easier. Your body has coping mechanisms but its up to you to activate them sooner rather than later.\n\nTwo things I learned: One, when you feel \"the darkness\" immediately do physical activity for as long as possible. No, don't binge watch TV/play Xbox/drink/smoke/etc. Make it physically demanding, self help books call it \"grounding\" yourself. Running with loud trance music was my outlet. My goal was to be in physical pain, so I didn't feel my emotional/mental pain. It didn't matter the time of day, weather, etc. I ran. Each month my runs got longer, and by the thick of it I would run and reach a trancelike state, reaching 8-10 miles before stopping. It made me feel at one with myself, my situation,  my environment/city, etc. It also garnered a good bit of attention from the opposite sex. (Granted at this time, I was in college and lived in a college town) This helped the healing process greatly. \n\nSecond, from my experience, don't get back with her: We tried several times to get back together in coming years, only to ruin all my short term relationships and dating prospects... it only brought back all the old feelings. Our last attempt was after nearly 7 years of being apart...it literally took that long for me to even be sexually open with her again. We told ourselves \"we were just kids back then\" and \"I've never loved anyone like you\" Nope... didn't work, I ended up leaving her, and you know what she said as she gathered her things the last day? \"Fuck you anyways, I slept with someone the first few weeks we got back together!\" I just said \"I know\" and a few months later, I had a new girlfriend who is now my wife.",

If you have a house, kids then you can talk about that stuff once she doesn't have your stuff or finances. \n\n\nA good friend recommended that I wait a month for every year I was with my ex before I started dating. Best advice ever, take it. Of course fool that I am I denied I even had any issues and got in a rebound relationship inside of 6 months. Bad idea don't do it it's not fair to the other person. You seem a lot more self aware then I was (you are actually acknowledgeing you aren't ok at this point and even that took me about a year. I'm an emotional dunce) so I doubt you'll probably have an easier time there.\n\n\nWork on your friendships or even build a social life if you don't have one.

If you share a home, she should be the one to move out ultimately, but get out of there in the mean time while she figures her shit out. \n\nYour impulse might be to spend some time alone. You can indulge that for a little while, but distractions in the form of friends and family will be a big help. Get out of the house as much as you can when you feel the slightest bit up to it. \n\n10 years and you were ready to marry her means you will be incredibly confused about your feelings for a while. She obviously feels bad and it's likely she will try and reconnect. There will be opportunities to be intimate with her again. It's easy for me to tell you to cut off all contact and not let this happen; it's another thing when you're hurt and vulnerable to actually follow through. Just know that it won't make things any better, that it will prolong the grieving process. \n\nYou may feel the urge to reach out, send an email about how you feel about her. Write the email. Don't send it. \n\nGood luck buddy. ",

Best advice is to just stay steadfast in your decision to leave her, do not trust that things will get better or that she will change, she won't and it will just shatter your trust in future relationships.  Become closer to your sister and best friend.  The next year is really going to suck.  But it will get better.  Use the time going forward to get in better shape, physically, mentally, and professionally.  Don't jump into another relationship as you'll only continually use this one as a benchmark for what the new one \"should\" be, and that is a recipe for disaster.  The last thing you need is more grief.  Find a female friend who you can do things with, someone who is completely outside of all your other social circles.  You're not going to expect what a blow this will be to your confidence.  You're going to find it difficult to want to experience new things with new people.

I finally opened my eyes and even though I know it was and still is hard for my kid to understand why his mom and I aren't together its for my own good and his. All that time I could have done a lot of things differently if I had known from the get go so I wouldn't be in the situations I'm in now.

She said she loved me too much to marry me knowing she'd done what she did.\n\n> She doesn't love the guy, it was just sex and she had been trying to stop the affair but I proposed before that happened and she said she knew when I was kneeling that she couldn't marry me, not after everything I'd done for her, so she told me.\n\nUgh, just ugh.\n\nShe confessed because you put her on the spot. It's not just sex with the other guy. She thinks she has a shot with him and if she gets engaged to you it may scare the other guy off.\n\nHell, for all you know, she's told this other guy that she's single. She'd have to come up with a compelling story for why she suddenly had an engagement ring.\n\nLong story short, this is a positive for you. Point blank, you're better off. She outed the affair and now she's out of your life.\n\n.... for now. That's the problem, she's out of your life *for now*.\n\nLook for her to come sniffing around in six to eight months, once the new relationship shine wears off with her co-worker. It may even happen sooner if she tries to get the other guy to commit and he bails on her.\n\nStay strong. Stay positive, and make sure you cut **all** contact with her. If she shows up again in the next few years, it's because she's looking for her responsible, trustworthy chump to keep life stable for her until she finds her next Romeo.",

            "Caution: I see some of you giving kudos to this tramp for fessing up. \n\nGoogle 'the pick me dance', a brilliant piece of mind fuckery where the cheater gets the 'chump' to up their game for more gifts, dinners, attention etc. \n\nCheaters are cancer. Cut them out, do the life chemo and move on Thankful you  dodged a bullet.",
            ">She said she loved me too much to marry me knowing she'd done what she did.\n\nThis is not true.\n\nShe doesn't love you anymore, and wants to continue with the other person.\n\nThis really sucks, man. Sorry you're going through this. If it helps, I experienced the same thing almost exactly a year ago. It gets better, but I won't lie, it will feel like there's a hole in your life for a long time.",
            "ten years?? I would have left her ass there immediately after she explained the cheating. ",
            "find out about this guy. Expose him\n",
            "Yeah, this is going to be condescending...  Did you guys talk about spending the rest of your lives together before you proposed and were you on the same page?\n\nAs mentioned here and elsewhere, a couple wanting to get married shouldn't be a surprise to either party.  The act of asking can be as much of a surprise as you'd like.",
            "Probably feels pretty rough, I'm sorry for that aspect man. But the reality is you dodged a huge bullet, marriage nowadays is a slavery contract for men. It also appears like you're the exact kind of guy that would get exploited since you a) got cheated on and b) didn't notice you were being cheated on. Move on, with the realization that you're now way better off and can learn from your mistake in the future. ",
            "I know I'll get shit for this but I'd Marry her any way. ",
            "Go to Vegas.  They sell coke at the strip clubs.  I went recently and was blown away (pun intended ) by how the strip clubs are way different than everywhere else.  The girls don't dance on poles..  they pretty much dance on your pole.  It's crazy.  You walk in and the next thing you know you have 2 girls on your lap and 2 pairs of tits in you face.  Made me forget about my wife REAL quick.  \n\nBest of luck!",
            "The act of infidelity is separate from the love you share. She's not lying when she says she loves you beyond comprehension. You're not weak if you forgive her.",

            "I'd say ask r/sex & r/polyamory for their perspectives. Because most people here will just say \"break up\". When in actuality, she's human and just like you she's going through this life not really knowing up from down or left from right. Not saying what she did is excusable, but just think about it, you know? That's your best friend and she fucked up big time once in 10 years? Do you really want to lose your best friend over something that could be worked out if you guys had an honest conversation with each other? \n\nI do suggest that during this time, you take your own space to get your emotions sorted out and think things over and allow her the same and then you guys can come back and talk it out. I say just go on break for right now.",
            "tell her thank you, forgive her if she apologize (if you want) and move on.  I'm just rationalizing right now, but she saved you a lot of heartache in the future.      \nYou'll find someone out there who is a right fit for you and who will treasure you as you will treasure her.",
            "Do not seek the comfort of the relationship again.\n\nYou would regret marrying a woman that you spent ten years caring for only to find out that the violated the relationship by letting some dude from work hit it (multiple times).\n\nMove on.  Time will heal this breakup.",
            "There's no doubt that this sucks, but here's what you do... Celebrate! \n\nYou found out she was an asshole before you were married and built even more of a life with her. You can't change the past so don't dwell on it. Get out there and do whatever it is you want to do with someone new or with no one at all. Find your own happiness and make your life great. ",
            "hey man, this shit happens. You were with this girl since you were 12, so 10 years later you are both 22ish and you want to get married? If this girl is at all attractive these are her most prime hookup years. If she has been with only one guy than no shit she is tempted to explore. You cant expect a young girl to stay loyal during these years. That shit is delusional. \n\nSorry this happened to you. You have month and months of recovery ahead of you. But the good news is that if you are committed to actually getting over her, you will :) I mean it would be ludicrous to allow one girls to completely ruin your life. wouldn't it? You're a strong adult man, you will deal with it and move forward!\n\nThis should be a very valuable lesson for you mate. And if you learn from it it will make you a much more mature and strong man. Young girls who are attractive WILL cheat. Generally speaking it's very smart not to get too attached to them. Wait until they're in their late 20s or early 30s. That's when they want to settle down.\n\nI bet i'll get downvoted for this, but this is the god's honest truth.\n\nBONUS TIP: break all contact with her. delete her from everything. EVERYTHING. erase her from your existence. trust me here bro. And most of all, completely ignore her if she ever comes crawling back. Because she might, and you dont take back damaged goods. \n\nSOURCE: I am a 30 year old man who has been through this shit. take my advice bro. spare yourself the anguish.",
            "Dude you didn't cry when your mom passed away? That's seriously fucked up dude, especially since you will cry like a baby over a girl who cheats on you but *not you're own mom*? \n\nYou need to do some soul searching on your own and find out what makes you so emotionally distant and unavailable. Everyone should cry when their mom dies, I can't imagine what kind of ice demon you must be when it comes to emotion. ",
