        "selftext": "\n\nMy dad recently moved his partner in without asking me or my siblings if it was ok.\n\nThis has created a lot of awkwardness for us, and my 2 younger siblings keep telling me they are uncomfortable living with her because it\u2019s like having a stranger in our house. I feel the same way. I don\u2019t really know how to cope so I\u2019ve just not really talked to her beyond saying hi and good night and how was your day to her. \n\nRecently, my dad has asked me why I haven\u2019t talked to her more and I told him that I\u2019m not that outgoing or talkative with strangers. He said that she wasn\u2019t a stranger and I said she felt like one. I asked why it wasn\u2019t ok for me to just coexist with her in the house and to just only exchange small pleasantries, and he got angry at me and said I needed to make her feel welcome. \n\nI just don\u2019t know how. She seems nice, but I\u2019ve been feeling depressed about not seeing my friends, and so I\u2019m tired and run-down a lot. I have a bad relationship with my mom, too, so I\u2019m wary of older women and women who are in a position to be maternal.\n\nTl;dr: I\u2019m looking for advice on how to deal with my dad\u2019s girlfriend moving in.",

            "Honestly? Sounds like you were doing fine. \n\nBe polite. Be pleasant. Maybe periodically try to engage with her. \n\nIt\u2019s not on you, the kid, to develop a relationship with this older adult. And if you aren\u2019t there yet, that\u2019s fine. \n\nMaybe ask your dad why this is such an issue for them. What do they want to happen? What do they view as wrong here?",
            "Did any of you meet her before he moved her in? It is so bizarre to me that some parents pull stunts like this.",
            "This is not on you - it's 100% on your dad. If he is someone you can talk to, sit him down and tell him how it made you feel that he didn't give you any input into moving someone into your home. Tell him you don't feel like you know his GF at all, and that you feel uncomfortable with the situation. If he can listen and own up to his messup, then you can go from there in figuring out ways to get along with GF. \n\n\n\n\n\nCoexisting with a roommate (essentially what she is now) is perfectly fine - be polite, don't leave a big mess, etc. Kind of prepares you for college life, in a way. But if you can, it might make things easier to be open to getting to know her, once the shock wears off. Your dad should be putting forth a majority of the effort in making that happen, since this was his decision.",
            "Your dad is expecting you to do the emotional labour of building a relationship with his girlfriend, which is a really shitty thing to do. It is his girlfriend and his children so he needs to act as the bridge not you. Tell him this.",
            "I wasn't asked for permission for my parents to move someone I'm when I was a teenager. Nor did I meet my mom's boyfriend before he moved in. However, that was on her. My dad however, has allow d us to meet and get to know his girlfriend before he gets a house with her for me to live in during the summer while I'm in college. This is not on you, this is on him to make her feel welcome. Especially since he didnt introduce her beforehand.",
            "I am so sorry you have to go through this, it is a very unpleasant experience and I completely get where you're coming from.\nIf I may ask, how long have your father and his GF been together? Have you spend time with her before she moved in? And has she made an effort to get to know you and your siblings or is she just there?\n\nWould you mind helping us paint the picture?",
            "Why is the job of a minor to make adults feel comfortable? Your dad is out of touch.",
            "Your dad screwed up here. He should have given you and your siblings much more of an opportunity to develop some kind of relationship with her (be it parental or not) before moving her into your home. That was a selfish decision on his part and it's not your fault you view this stranger as stranger. Your dad wanted to skip the hard part of actually letting his kids get to know his new partner and go right to the part where you're all a family and that's just not how this works.",
            "As a step mom this seems so weird to me! My stepdaughter was younger than you when I moved in, she was 11, but it was definitely a conversation and I had been around for years. I was not a stranger.\n\nIt's definitely not fair to you or your siblings. Is there another adult you can talk to? Therapist, aunt, uncle? \nMy parents are still married but I could see my dad doing this. Well my house, I want her to move in so she's in. Kids will adjust. \n\nIs there anyway you and your dad can talk privately and say something about how you want him to be happy etc but you and your siblings are still adjusting?   Good luck.",
            "This is all on your father.  I don't understand people trying to say you're even partly responsible for ANYTHING here.\n\nLet's put aside the fact that you're 16 years old, and your father just pulled this nonsense.  Let's put aside that there are two other, even younger children here also feeling infringed on.\n\nIf you're living with someone and you want or need to  move someone else in, you don't just do it, you talk with the people living with you first.  This even goes for them staying the night.  It's just common courtesy to give a roommate that warning.\n\nI mean this is standard even for two strangers but as your FATHER, moving in his girlfriend, he should have absolutely talked with you and your younger siblings beforehand.\n\nIt's his home and he can do what he wants legally, but it's just not right to pull that crap.  Even if you had not been ok with it(as you aren't now), at least you would have known it was coming and had been able to somewhat prepare yourself for the loss of privacy.\n\nIf a friend of mine pulled something I've this on his kids I'd probably yell at him.  Totally inconsiderate.  I'm guessing this is part of why your mom divorced him, sorry to say.",
            "This is your dad\u2019s responsibility to facilitate ways to help the family get along and bond. He can hop on google and figure it out. I literally just typed \u201chow to help children bond with new partner\u201d into google and a wealth of resources appeared. This is your dads relationship and it\u2019s on him to do this. Keep on how you\u2019ve been handling things.",
            "While your dad isn\u2019t necessarily wrong for moving moving his girlfriend in, the way he went about it is very wrong. He absolutely should have talked to you and your siblings about it in advance and helped to better prepare all you you, including his girlfriend. There should have been some get-to-know-each-other dinners at home, maybe a family weekend outing that included her, etc. well before she moved in. If she feels like a stranger to you then that\u2019s on your dad and maybe on her a little bit also, but it\u2019s certainly not on you. You have been polite and have done nothing to make her feel UNwelcome, which means you\u2019re doing the best you possibly can given the circumstances. What has SHE done to make YOU feel more comfortable and at ease with her moving into your space? She\u2019s the adult, your dad should be talking to her about how to facilitate a warmer relationship, not you.",
            "As a stepmom, the work here is NOT on you. It\u2019s on your father and his girlfriend to make this work.",
            "Ok well first we don\u2019t even know how long the father has known the chick so that\u2019s one. Secondly that doesn\u2019t give him any right to move her in so sudden. Here are a couple of things you could do that would help:\n\n1. Try talking to him and telling him you respect her and his decision to be happy but you are not comfortable and that it will take time for you to get used to it\n\n2. You could try to make small talk with her or something, but giving you said you don\u2019t have a good relationship with older women because of your mom it might be hard. But don\u2019t force it, it takes time to get used to someone. And if she is a genuinely good person, she would understand.\n\n3. Number 2 brings me to my next option actually. You could ask to talk to her alone and bring up the fact that this is all new to you and you aren\u2019t being mean by not talking to her much but you just don\u2019t know how to talk to older women because of your relationship with your mom. Also try to say that you would consider one with her but she has to understand that some things take time.\n\nI\u2019m a 15 y/o so I know how that feels. It was awkward for me at first with my dads gf because my mom didn\u2019t like her (and still doesn\u2019t) but I soon got used to her after a while because she was so nice and I felt way more comfortable talking to her than to my mom since I don\u2019t really have a mental connection with her (still a great mom though) but ofc since my mom was still single at the time, she now has a new bf and I have to try and make some type of connection with him.\n\nBut I know that if the connection isn\u2019t there then it just ain\u2019t there. And I\u2019m gonna tell you sometimes, but most of the time, you can\u2019t force things that aren\u2019t there to be there. That\u2019s like forcing a person who doesn\u2019t have feelings for you anymore to like you again. It\u2019s impossible. So in the end if it doesn\u2019t work out and you just don\u2019t genuinely feel comfortable with forming anything with her then your dad just has to deal with it. Also talk to your younger siblings and tell them something similar to what I told you. But this is your life and we are strangers, go with your gut sweetie.",
            "Just keep being polite and respectful. A relationship will form or it won\u2019t. Depression is hard, and I hope soon it\u2019s safe to spend time with your friends again. My dad got married to a woman I had only met 2x before the wedding, so I understand how awkward it can be to have a stranger in the house. It should get better with time.",
            "To people saying the parent doesn't owe OP anything and can just move his partner in without notice and expect her to treat this stranger like family: \n\nShe is a child. He is her parent. He A. Has not considered the effect that this will take on his children, and B. Can't expect them to treat her like family when they literally just met her as she was moving in. This takes a toll on OP's mental and emotional health, and it takes nothing for her dad to not be selfish. No one is trying to dictate anyone's relationship, I'm sure if the guy is dating again that's fine, but trying to enforce a non existent relationship between GF and OP is straight up not going to happen unless there's effort on GF and Dad's part to build that relationship. She is not responsible for how she feels when the adults put her in an uncomfortable situation- They are ADULTS and have made irresponsible decisions, it's not her job to remedy them. Lastly, if you feel like your relationship with your partner is more important than the wellbeing of your children, for fucks sake, let another adult who will prioritize them take guardianship so they at least feel like a priority to someone.",
            "It's her job and your father's--not yours to make the effort to be accepted in \"your pack\". She has to show that she cares too and that shouldn't fall on the kids' responsibilities and obligations",
            "One thing you might consider is telling your dad how you are feeling (depressed, isolated, overwhelmed, awkward with a new person in the house, anxious about having a new adult female figure in the house given your relationship with your mom) and telling your dad you think you need to talk to a therapist about everything. \n\nYou sound like you're overwhelmed and like you need an impartial adult to talk to  and help you sort out everything that you're going through right now. It won't necessarily make everything better at home, but it will give you a safe space to unpack it and give you some tools to cope with an uncomfortable time and situation.",
            "I\u2019d suggest talking to your dad and asking him for a formal introduction and to HELP you get to know each other. Like he can cook dinner you all sit down. He can set up movie nights where you show her your favorite movie. \n\nHe might think that he\u2019s giving you space to get to know her on your own time but doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re trying. Meanwhile you need him to help.",
            "I dont think your dad should have \"asked\" you, but he should have discussed it with you first. Efforts should have been made to ensure that everyone was comfortable and the transition smoother. I would suggest talking to your dad and expressing your concerns. \n\nBeing in a blended family is difficult. For all people. Starting with being polite/friendly is a good start. And something everyone should do for roommates. Hopefully your dad sees where he went wrong and makes efforts to help everyone get to know one another more. \n\nBut also I think some empathy could go a long way. Being a step parent is difficult. So your understanding that and trying your best would be awesome. And being a step kid is difficult. So their understanding that and trying their best would be awesome. Everyone has to give a little here if you all expect to move forward.",
            "Oh man, that's a big expectation on you.  I'm sorry you're going through that.  I'm a mom and a stepmom and what your dad is expecting is unreasonable.  Its perfectly fine for you to just be polite and kind to this new houseguest when you see her around.  You arent obligated to more than that.  If you think shes nice and want to maybe help with dinner or watch TV together those things are low stress activities, but dad and girlfriend are going to have to get over it.  \n\nDad was wrong to spring her on you and dad was wrong to lecture you after he did that.  I hope you're able to get some help for your depression.",
            "\"Dad, it feels like I'm living with a stranger because I *am* living with a stranger. I don't know much about her and she and I have never hung out. If you want her to be part of the family, then we need to do things together besides *coexist*.\"",
            "The best thing my dads wife ever did was give me aaallll the space I wanted. She never pushed for a relationship, and I respect her for that so much. \n\nI\u2019m sorry the adults in your life are putting this on you. You\u2019ve been dealing with it absolutely correctly from what you\u2019ve said so far. Would your dad take it well if you showed him this post?",
            "I\u2019m an adult in possibly a similar situation someday (as the new girlfriend of a man with three daughters.)\n\nI would never move into their space without a good long period of time to get to know the girls. And I would also want to have a discussion with all three of them about how they felt about me, like, moving in to the home they share with their dad. To make sure they were okay with it. \n\nPlease just do the best you can with the situation. It is not your job to be the welcome wagon for the girlfriend. Definitely be pleasant, but personally I would wish the adults in this situation had been more proactive about setting the situation up to succeed.",
            "The GF has to know how strange it is for you guys. His expectations of you are unreasonable and he\u2019s not being understanding/nice about this new, unexpected situation he put you in. I think you\u2019re doing just fine. You can\u2019t force or fake something you don\u2019t feel. I honestly think it\u2019s on her to build a relationship and help YOU adjust. Not the other way around. She\u2019s a big girl.",
            "Your father is being inconsiderate of your feelings and your young so obviously \ud83d\ude44 things like this are going to affect you in this way \n\nThe fact is wether your father choose to ignore this situation or not she is yes a stranger at lest if he wanted this transition to be more appropriate then he would of actually built up this relationship not just throw her at you \n\nI think your dad knows that it\u2019s not okay with you guys but obviously it should be obvious that your trying not to hurt his feelings \n\nBut he has no right to judge you or yell at you because you have those feelings beyond you just being his daughter you are also a human being who has the right to feel whatever it is your feeling i can\u2019t tell you how you feel or how you should feel \n\nOverall maybe it would help to talk to your mom and maybe see if you can talk to a councillor at school that\u2019s a lot of baggage to carry on ones shoulder",
            "First of all, this isn\u2019t on you at all and it sounds like an uncomfortable situation for you and your siblings, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this boat. \n\nDoes your dads girlfriend know about the situation with your mom? (Does your dad know how bad your situation with your mum is?)\n\nIt\u2019s rough not being able to see friends right now, and I totally understand your depressed feelings. \n\nYour last paragraph honestly is perfect. Would you perhaps feel comfortable saying something along those lines to her? Perhaps if you use the term \u201cnew person\u201d instead of \u201cstranger\u201d it softens it a little bit too. \n\nAs the adult, it\u2019s on her and your dad to make you and your siblings feel comfortable, but hopefully if you let them know you\u2019re open to it, they will do just that",
            "As a single dad, I would definitely let my daughter get used to a prospective partner BEFORE the living together phase. In all honesty it would take a while to even get to the point of introducing a new partner to my daughter. \n\nYou are allowed to be you. And you are allowed to take your own time to warm up to someone and get used to them. This is his fault, not yours.",
            "It's his job to make you guys feel comfortable with the woman he just moved into your family's house, not the other way around.",
            "You're fine imo, your dad is asking too much. He wants a cohesive family instantly for his own comfort, but that's just too bad. He should have been more considerate if he wanted more consideration from you.",
            "I want to give the benefit of the doubt and say we don\u2019t know the father\u2019s side of the story here. We don\u2019t know if the GF has been trying or if the father has been trying to get everyone aquatinted or not. \n\nThe only advice I can give is that the relationships you form are dependent on you. If you don\u2019t want a relationship with your dad\u2019s GF you don\u2019t need to try to form one. If you want to alleviate being awkward with her you\u2019ll have to become closer to her. And you also serve as a role model to your younger siblings in this regard. But with any relationship it\u2019s a two way street so it\u2019s not just up to you either. So I wish you the best in working things out here",
            "tbh it\u2019s not your responsibility to get to know her. She should, as the adult, be making the effort to have a relationship with you and your younger siblings. Since your dad already had kids before they got together, she should know that she\u2019s not just signing up for a man but she\u2019s signing up for a family and treat it like that.\nThis is a big change for you guys I\u2019m sure. And if you have bad experiences with parental figures in the past, it makes a lot of sense that you are feeling this way. I would say that you have to approach every person with an open mind. If she\u2019s making an effort to get to know you guys definitely keep being polite. But honestly if she\u2019s not making an effort idk why you should be the one responsible for it; she\u2019s pretty much a stranger until she initiates. If she\u2019s being rude, that\u2019s completely on her and not your fault.\nPerhaps bring up to your dad that you don\u2019t know her as much as he does, and that you are open to getting to know her as long as the communication is reciprocated, and if she\u2019s willing to make an effort. He probably won\u2019t understand if he continues to react the same way he has been to you...but it\u2019s worth an effort",
            "It sounds like your dad is an a$$holio",
            "You\u2019re dad seems to be focused on his love life, and doesn\u2019t seem to understand that this will be a weird transition on his kids. I was in a similar situation when I was 14, but the even better part was is that my mom was also living with us (in a separate room from my dad) that was fun. \n\nAnyway, communication is important. I would just let him know that you need time, just as you would with anyone else such as a new friend. You still have to get to know her but it will take time.  Especially with how the world has been. When my dads girlfriend (now wife) first moved in, we had an awful relationship and I never wanted to be around her. 6 years later, I definitely see her as family. Relationships take time, but don\u2019t feel bad for being uncomfortable or just wanting some space - it\u2019s a weird situation and a weird time we are living in. Good luck, I think you\u2019re doing great so far!\n\nEdit: both my dad and stepmom apologized many times for their actions for how they moved in years after. They thought it was the best timing at the time, but learned that it was a mistake.",
            "My mom did this to my sister and I as well, except it was with my stepdad. I was 13/14 at the time, and it was explosive because of our contradicting personalities and beliefs (and me just being an angsty teen). If you do not feel comfortable doing anything other than exchanging pleasantries, that\u2019s a valid way to feel and is 100% okay. In my personal opinion, she\u2019s technically invading your space, you\u2019re not invading hers. Your home is somewhere you want to be comfortable. Overall I would take things slowly and see how they go. If you continue to feel like you and her do not vibe well together, coexistence is fine. I know your dad got upset about making her feel welcome, but if it\u2019s a choice, you can have a private conversation with him regarding your feelings once everyone has settled into the living arrangement.",
            "Oh my fucking wow, \u201cdad acts like inconsiderate, impulsive teenager and puts everyone out, makes them feel awkward in their own home, and then puts the burden of being an adult, fixing it, and doing what he should have done on actual teenagers.\u201d\n\nYou need to tell him this isn\u2019t your job or your problem. He decided to do this like this. He can do the work to make everyone comfortable since he failed to have conversations up front. This fucking grosses me out to no end. I\u2019m so sick of these grown ass men putting their romantic relationships above their families and then trying to force everyone to normalize their cringy behavior.",
            "Your father should have discussed and give you and your sibling some time to develop relationship with his girlfriend.\n\nI was in a similar situation and it was not pleasant for me. First time was when my dad pulled me out of boarding to school to live with him and his new family (his second wife and a 3 years old). At this point, he has been remarried and had a child without my prior knowledge. So I went from being in boarding school barely see any of my family to living in a family that is almost like a stranger's home. Second time was when my mom moved me from my father (Thailand) to live with her in the US. I knew that she had been married and have my half-brother already, but I never met my step-dad or step-brothers before. Adjusting to living with my step father and also adjusting to American culture was really difficult.\nThe result was that I ended up having very distant and little contact with my family. \n\nI would sit down with your dad and talk to him if possible.",
            "I ignored my stepdad for the first year he lived with us (I was a senior in high school) It\u2019s uncomfortable AF and there\u2019s no way for it not to be. I would say \u201cyou should...\u201d or \u201cyou could...\u201d but it really just takes time. She\u2019s one of the adults here. I think the onus is on her and your dad to help ease the transition.",
            "> He said that she wasn\u2019t a stranger \n\nShe's not a stranger to **your dad** but he needs to realize that she is absolutely a stranger to his kids.  His kids weren't born with ESP and can't read his mind and didn't somehow telepathically absorb his knowledge of her.  It's your dad's responsibility to bridge the gap, make her feel welcome but he's failing in that respect 100%.  He's making no effort there.  He's completely dropping the ball.\n\nSince talking to your dad is as effective as talking to a wall, I would suggest one of 3 things\n\n1. Stop talking to them period.\n2. Go move in with your mom is that's possible\n3. Talk to the gf.  Tell her straight up that she is a stranger to you and your siblings and presence is uncomfortable.  Since you talking to your dad hasn't gotten it across that he has done absolutely nothing to bridge that gap and it is his and his responsibility alone to initiate that, maybe if she says it to your dad he'll listen.",
            "Some suggestions on bridging the gap: try having a family dinner, or a family game night; pick a lazy Sunday and show her old photos of you/your sibs (school plays, fav birthdays, visiting grandma? Even stuff that you don't see as important); do a movie night where everyone shows their favorite movie, start with the younger siblings; make a meal together, maybe she has family recipes she wants to share....\n\nIt can feel like an uphill battle, but you're showing that you are willing to get to know her. She also has to be willing to get known! It's also important that your dad understands that he can't just \"add lady instant family!\" - in a way, she has to do the whole \"dating\" process with his kids (you and your sibs) you're not an optional part of his life! You and your dad could maybe look up resources about divorced families and new relationships.\n\nIt's a lot, but be willing to show that you're not trying to be a difficult teenager, but this is a huge life change and you kids need to be respected as equal members of the family.\n\nGood luck!",
            "You don\u2019t have to be anything other than polite. This is a HUGE boundary bash and your dad sounds like he doesn\u2019t give a shit.",
            "I went through the exact same thing 6 years ago, I was also 16. The only thing I can tell you is have a heart to heart conversation with your dad and hope she moves out",
            "Be as pleasant and positive as possible for 2 years then move out.",
            "I personally feel like I don\u2019t need permission to do anything in my own home and my relationship, with anyone, should be built with that person and not based off another\u2019s experience/relationship/opinions. You can try talking with him about how to appropriately interact with her but unless she\u2019s asleep in your bed I would not insult his judgment.  \n\nIt\u2019s inconsiderate to move in someone without a conversation but your dad doesn\u2019t owe you or your siblings anything concerning his partner. It is reasonable for him to ask you to use your manners and build your own appropriate relationship with her the same way you meet new people (it seems extremely childish that you\u2019re making a point to not be friendly and only cordial yet avoidant). \n\nLearn about her by simply talking to her. Be polite, honest, and sincere. Don\u2019t assume anything negative without solid proof. She may be human (good and bad) but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s out to harm or abuse anyone.  \n\nLastly, get out of your own way. She may end up being a really nice person to have in your corner especially considering your poor relationship with your mom. She\u2019s not your mom so it\u2019s a clean slate to have femme energy that is nurturing and caring (but you have to be open to the possibilities.) \n\nAsk her to tell about herself.

I can't speak for you because I'm not in your shoes, my parents have been single for years since the divorce, but I do know it breaks my heart watching my parents be so alone. Especially during covid. Everyone needs someone. I think its better over all for your dad to have someone there for him to support him, rather than being alone. Does she treat him well? Does she make him smile? Is she worth getting to know ( at your own pace, when you're ready of course )\n\nI would have a talk with him about expectations. You should want to compromise and coexist, but it isn't really fair for him to expect you to go out of your way for anybody if you are not comfortable yet- as long as you're respectful and not snobby. Him adding pressure wont help, the relationship should come naturally. When anybody over thinks it its going to feel more weird.",

I'm sure with the pandemic you didn't have normal opportunities to have spent time with her the past year, but now she's living in your home. She's probably feeling as uncomfortable as you or more so---there are 3 of you kids and only 1 of her and I'm sure she feels unwelcome and is likely trying not to step on anyone's toes or assert herself too much. If she seems nice, try talking to her. It's not your responsibility to make her feel welcome (dad's wrong there) but it might be more pleasant for you and your siblings to increase your comfort level around her and the only way for that to happen is if you allow a relationship to develop. Start simple. Ask if you guys can all bake cookies together or make popcorn or something. If she's part of your home you may as well try to get along instead of accepting the fact that it feels weird and leaving it at that.\n\nDon't judge her or all \"older women\" by your bad relationship with your mom.

It\u2019s great that he\u2019s trying to see that the two of you or all of the children and his girlfriend can get along. And no you do not have to kiss up to her. But if she\u2019s nice and if she treats you well then it won\u2019t harm you to treat her as well as you see she\u2019s treating you. I\u2019m not suggesting that she is to replace your mom. But she may be able to help you out with things that any other mom could do, just because of her age and experience.\n\nI am really glad that you took the initiative to speak kindly to her even if it is just in a minimal way. That is the least you can do, and you were mature enough to have recognized that. Think about this. Things won\u2019t get worse if the two of you do happen to get along.

            "You don't have any obligation to make her feel welcome anymore than she does to impress or mother you, you already have a mother. There's no reason not to be civil and maintain communications with her, you could end up good friends. But your dad sounds like a piece of work so if I were you I'd get a job after school so you can move out at 18. If he wanted the happy family unit he should have tried harder with your mom or realized it wasn't a match in the first place before destroying his children's sense of security in their own home. You're onto something not trusting people of their age as they tend to think that being too cheap to pay for birth control means you owe them something, you don't. They put a roof over your head and clothes on your back yes, but more because they didn't want to be viewed as the pariah they really are by their peers. \n\nHowever you do owe them civility and courtesy, if it gets bad, and I mean actually bad not what most millennials call bad, but actually bad, don't hesitate to contact child services or the Police. Asking you to help make her welcome is one thing, thinking it's your duty lets anyone with a brain know exactly what kind of person he is, and if she's in love with him then you know exactly how she is too. My advice, start becoming independent now and seek counseling as soon as you're on your own so you don't project onto your own children some day.",

Pick and choose which changes are too much wisely, and above all else remember that while your feelings of awkwardness are warranted, it might be just as hard for this person to come into an established family, she probably feels like an intruder.

In a few years time you will be living on your own, and a decade thereafter might perhaps consider moving in with someone, too, and then it will be your choice.\nWhat is important of course is that if find that your father\u2019s girlfriend is not nice to you, you should tell him immediately.

Feeling depressed or uncomfortable is valid. \n\nAs others have mentioned, talking to a counselor or other adult may be helpful.

After that,  as the older sibling,  its really important for you to be open to getting to know her imo. Your younger siblings will model after you,  so if you are standoffish, they will too. This won't improve anyone's life just co existing. Your mental health as well the rest of the family's will be better if you can all enjoy life together as a unit. Now I don't know this lady,  but she might be a super awesome woman who could be a friend to you and your siblings,  (I'm sure she's not trying to replace your mother. ) soon you may be leaving to college or adult life,  but your younger siblings may continue living with her for a few years to come,  I'm sure they could benefit from a positive female role model in their lives.

He also should have taken your concerns into consideration, even if he ultimately decided against your wishes. This too would have allowed both of y'all to see potential problems and brainstorm potential solutions, making the transition easier.\n\nBut ultimately is was your father's responsibility to talk to you about this, and it is your father's fault for not doing so, not the fault of  his girlfriend. I would try your best not to hold your father's mistakes against her.\n\nAs far as how to coexist, when you are ready you should sit them both down and discuss these issues with them. Write down all of the points you want to say first. If you are not ready for that maybe write each of them a letter expressing your concerns, but try not to be accusatory, don't write \"and you did A,B,&C and that was wrong...\" Rather write,  \"when she suddenly moved in without me knowing ahead of time, it made me feel...\"\n\nLet them know how you feel and where your boundaries are. You might not be an adult just yet but you almost are, and as such your dad needs to start respecting you as an almost adult, which essentially means treating you like an adult when the situation calls for it, and this is absolutely one of those situations.",
            "Your dad screwed up by not introducing her more gradually. He also screwed up by putting this on you. You (and she) are left to make the best of an uncomfortable situation. The easiest way to make things more comfortable, in my experience, is to make friends. It doesn\u2019t have to be best friends, or even casual friends. But in your life there are people you\u2019re going to see regularly who are friends of friends or significant others of friends, or of relatives. They may not be your favorite individual, but yet you have to be social (or familial). Be as friendly as you can manage, and try to find something to talk about. Make spending a little time together as pleasant for each of you as you can. Ask them about themselves. Tell them small amounts about yourself. \n\nThere are friends of my friends whom I find  annoying, superior, or awkward, or whatever. But I wind up enjoying the 10 or 15 minutes that we talk, because we have found a little common ground. Neither of us would call the another to hang out, but for those social events, we can deal.\n\nI know this may sound like the opposite of what you want. You are uncomfortable and probably unhappy, and you want people to know. Being nice does not compute. But as stated, you can make the best of a bad situation. Making it worse is not in anyone\u2019s interest.",

I understand a little better than (siblings) because they are just little kids, but it is going to take time for all of us to be comfortable with each other. I'm sure she's a little uncomfortable, too. Trying to rush things just puts another layer of weirdness over it for everyone. Maybe we can just build it up one day at a time? That's how \"They\" say the strongest foundations are formed.\"\n\nI don't know. A real counselor can tell you if that's a good idea or not. But if you say it like that, you are letting her know you didn't hate her on sight and you aren't working against her.

            "Like others have asked I want to know how long you have known his girlfriend before she moved in. What did you dad say when she was moving in? Has she made an effort to socialize with you and your siblings? Was there a necessary reason for her to move in? Things are difficult right now and sometimes people are moving in due to covid, loss of employment/reduced employment or to help with kids that are taking classes online.\n\nYour dad shouldn't have moved her in without introducing her to all three of you and making sure you all get along. However, for kids sometimes there is never enough time to feel comfortable. Your father and his GF are the adults here and should do a better job at facilitating the situation to make things easier. However we don't know if they are doing all they can and you're being resistant or if they aren't even trying and expecting you to do all the work. Regardless since she is living with you then it's best to do what you can to make the situation better. Think of things you enjoy doing or your siblings enjoy doing that all of you could do together: watching a movie/tv, cooking, playing games, going for walks/bike rides/hikes, playing sports, etc. You could also set time aside for the two of you to just talk (this doesn't really help with the siblings though). You can also consider doing things around the house together, cooking or cleaning. If she's cooking then definitely take the time to learn from her. If she's not cooking and your dad isn't cooking then maybe you can see if you two of you could cook together. I bring up cooking because it's a good activity to do together and it's one of those things I wish I learned more before living on my own.\n\nI understand being wary of older women and it's fair to be hesitant if you don't want to become too vulnerable, but talking with older people can be helpful. I know that as a teenager you really want to talk with your friends, but talking with someone older can sometimes be an interesting experience. I appreciate what I've learned from those who are older.",
            "I know how you feel  My mum moved her bf in without asking me or my sister too, despite stating before she'd never do that. He should have asked you and your siblings directly if you're comfortable with taking such a major step. Furthermore he is trying to put the onus on you for building a relationship which is totally unfair. So don't feel guilty here whatsoever. Sounds like you're handling it fine so far.\n\nJust try and communicate your feelings directly to the both of them. You're well within your rights to be uncomfortable at what has happened here, it's clearly been rushed. I hope they will be the adults here and take your feelings on board. Things will work out better further along the line I would think  Good luck, making this post and how it's written shows a great deal of maturity.",
            "I've been on both sides of this as a teen my mom moved her boyfriend in when I didn't have a relationship w/him, I hated him he was loud, rude, and abusive, but not to me in front of my mom. She didn't ask and I never expected her to as she is the adult and it's her house. That being said I had a bad relationship w/my mom at that time, because I didn't know if she would listen to me, or care how I felt, yrs later after we talked she says she would have put him out but who knows if she would have at the time. I was just polite, took care of my brothers as was expected, and stayed in my lane, I never tried to have a relationship w/him because I didn't like him, and the way he treated me. (She is now happily married for 25 yrs to a different man who treats me as if I'm his own.) I was 13~14 when this happened.                                                      I have also been the girlfriend who moved in w/my 2 kids and his kids( only 1 lived w/us fulltime the other stayed living w/his mom) his daughter moved in shortly after I moved in, her life w/her bio mom was bad, I treated, loved and accepted her as my own. I made it clear she had a mom, I'm not here to try and replace anyone, but in our house I'm the mom, it would be our rules, that we as parents set together, for all the kids to follow. I spoke to my daughter everyday before she moved in, if she was having a bad day she called me, if her bio mother was being abusive she called me. So we had a great relationship but I made an effort to have a relationship, and so did she.                                                                       My suggestion is speak to your dad openly and candidly, don't hold back about how you feel, why you feel that way, and tell him your siblings are feeling uncomfortable as well and voice their opinions to him too; but don't be disrespectful, he being the adult doesn't owe anyone an explanation or need anyone's permission. He should have however made an effort for you to build a relationship w/each other, before just moving her in, and her being an adult should have thought about having a relationship w/all of you so that everyone is comfortable. My advice is just sit and have a open conversation w/your dad, explain why you feel the way you do. As a parent I don't get angry w/my kids for their feelings, and when they explain why they think or feel how they doI usually get it. I'm open minded and realistic too. I'm sorry he failed to do it better and you feel so uncomfortable. I pray you get to a place where you all can live in peace and happily.",
            "It's going to feel uncomfortable for a while. Even if you knew way in advance it would likely still feel odd.\n\nIt will take time, and probably effort all round (it takes two to make a relationship) but you don't have to force it. Take it at your own speed, and tell your dad to be patient",
            "Look, the best you could do you\u2019ve done already, I wouldn\u2019t stress about it really, your siblings and you could make conversations more productive by just speaking about what you\u2019ve done today so far like what you learned at school that week, or something new you learned at your job this week, or if you started a workout routine, read a article or headline from Instagram or Twitter, that could make things less awkward around the house",
            "Jeeeeez. Tell your father that it is very unacceptable to move his girlfriend without even having a constructive dialogue first. He needs to understand that although he might think he is doing the best he can, he is hurting every relationship involved by just throwing a new girlfriend into the mix without really talking about it",
            "It shouldn't be on you to do this since you are a kid, but it might actually help you feel less isolated if she is nice and you can form a new friendship. I would call a family meeting and calmly explain that while you want them to be happy they blindsided you and you and your siblings are young and overwhelmed by the change especially right now. Then I'd agree to try to get to know her and make an effort and maybe everyone can come up with fun stuff to do that could make the relationship less awkward. Cooking, watching movies, boardgames, etc. if its possible to form a relationship it could be great. I'm sorry they did that to you though. But sadly you have reached the moment that happens to every kid when they realize the extent to which their adult parents are actually incredibly immature and just fallible people trying to get through life like everyone else. It can be shocking and jarring and sometimes means your needs are cast aside.",
            "Whether this is weird or not depends on how long they have been dating.\n\nI'd guess normally you'd date for awhile before introducing the kids and then do things together before someone moves in.\n\nIf she's literally a stranger, then that is weird.\n\nIf it's just that she's not a family member yet, that takes time.",
            "Can you tell your father that things are weird mostly because you didn\u2019t move she was moving in until she did? I am a stepmom close to her age and my stepsons is 15. He knew months before we all moved in together that this was happening, which gave the two of us time to get to know each other and spend time together before moving day. \n\nI also agree with everyone who says it\u2019s her responsibility to get to know you as long as you are being polite to her. She\u2019s the adult, not you.",
            "If the GF is serious enough to have moved in, the dad should have introduced his kids to her long before then. They should have an established relationship before moving her in. If he\u2019s only just started dating her, then he\u2019s an even bigger idiot then we thought"

She immediately apologized for leaving and for making me worry.\n\nTurns out I really underestimated Lacy's redditing and she ended up seeing the post when she was gone. Honestly I can't think of a better way for this to have gone. She told me she stayed up all night reading every single comment.\n\nIn summary, she did some serious self-reflection and has admitted to me that she is suffering from depression and that the injuries were a way for her to receive the attention that she wanted so incredibly badly. But also admitted that the whole process really just made her feel pathetic and worthless inside and ultimately worsened her depression. It had become a rather vicious cycle. \n\nWe talked a long time but it was ultimately her who said she needed and wanted therapy. We have spent time today looking through her options and she plans to make an appointment Monday. \n\nI think it was the stories from those who had similar experiences really hit it home for her. \n\nThis whole update has been pre-approved by the girl in question and she has also asked that I let you all know how much you have helped her \"get her shit together\" (her exact words).\n\nTLDR: Girlfriend found reddit post, wants to go get help, all is well.",

            "Hi Lacy! That's really great that you're being honest and willing to get help and that you've got someone who is being supportive. I think you will probably do really well with therapy.\n\nI'm making my own throwaway here because some of this sounded like stuff I used to do. It has made me feel better to see other people saying they've done similar stuff, so I thought I would add my story as well because at times I have also found myself trying to make injuries worse without really knowing why.\n\nI cut myself for a long time, but I always went to great lengths to hide it and never sought any sort of attention for it. I literally did it for a decade before I ever spoke to anyone out loud about it. For me that was totally different than other injuries.\n\nAt times I would try to hurt myself \"accidentally.\" I sprained my ankle once, which was genuinely a complete accident (came at a really inconvenient time, too) but after it happened I kept injuring my ankle more to delay healing and then trying to sprain it again. Other times I intentionally let myself faint (note: I never actually faked fainting, they were real faints but I let them happen), made myself catch an illness, let myself have some nasty falls, and similar things.\n\nThe weird thing is that a lot of times I wouldn't tell anyone about my injury. Plenty of those fainting spells happened with no one else around, for instance, and then when I did faint with other people around I was extremely uncomfortable with the attention and would deflect it as soon as I could. It was like I liked the idea of attention more than the reality of it.\n\nI saw some comments about Munchhausen's By Proxy on the last post being a potential problem and while I can't speak for anyone else, having my own slight Munchhausen's issues has in no way ever made me even think about doing that to anyone else. That's a whole other realm of behavior to me even if it does involve some similar symptoms.\n\nI really, really hated myself for feigning illness, but I've learned to forgive myself. I was always afraid of being called attention-seeking because there is such a stigma about that, especially for women, but people do need some attention, that's just how we are, and while there are definitely bad ways of trying to get attention, needing attention doesn't make someone a bad person. \n\nIn my case I was the oldest of a large, conservative, homeschooling family. My parents talk about how as a baby I got more attention than any of my siblings, and I'm sure that's true given that I was the first, but as I got older I was expected to set an example to all my younger siblings. I wasn't supposed to need anything because I was the oldest. I was mostly left to teach myself because the younger ones needed my mom's attention more in their schoolwork. And not only was I the oldest, but out of the older kids I was the only girl so I feel like I got stuck watching the younger kids a lot more than any of my brothers. I was almost like another parent to my youngest siblings. I remember multiple times where I was upset about something and I was told that I was too old to get upset (even if I was only 10) and reminded that we had actual babies in the house.\n\nI was very depressed, started self-harming very early, and developed a fairly serious eating disorder, all of which I hid for years until in my early 20's I finally ended up hospitalized for the eating disorder. My parents didn't believe in mental illness as anything but a spiritual problem, so even though (they say now) they knew what was going on, they never got me any help.\n\nI kind of wonder if part of my desire to have a physical issue was because I did have real issues that probably did need attention, but I knew that a purely physical issue was the only way I could get sympathy.\n\nSometimes, too, I was covering up my problems with a physical issue. It's hard to explain to people that the reason I could barely walk was that I hadn't eaten in a week, so a sprained ankle or a recent illness provided a better excuse. I guess I could have just lied about it, but I wouldn't do that. Somehow making myself sprain my ankle seemed better to me than outright lying about having a sprained ankle.\n\nI did fantasize about having an illness that would garner me lots of sympathy and attention, but like I said, I was uncomfortable with the reality of receiving attention so I never went that far.\n\nI still don't know exactly why I did what I did, but my point is that I've learned to be gentle with myself. Maybe I was attention-seeking, but I can forgive myself for that. After all, it's possible that I actually did need attention.\n\nIt was easier at first for me to feel sympathetic to other attention seekers while I still reviled myself. I remember reading online somewhere (it might have been reddit) about paramedics who deal with patients who fake seizures and other medical issues for attention. Most people were criticizing the patients and saying how awful they were until one paramedic told a story about a girl he used to see regularly who would fake seizures and how annoyed he was about her until he found out that she was living with a stepdad who would sexually abuse her and faking seizures was how she would get herself out of the situation.\n\nThat's obviously an extreme case and I have never personally dealt with anything that bad, but it made me realize how judgmental I had been of attention-seekers, *especially myself*, when I really didn't understand what might make someone do what they do. It was a while before I was able to forgive myself, but feeling compassion for other people helped me eventually start to apply some of that compassion to myself.\n\nI am in mental health treatment now. I actually did do some real, unintentional, damage to my heart with an eating disorder (funny how I would try to have other physical problems but assumed that my eating behaviors would never hurt me) and had to be hospitalized for that, but I'm in excellent physical health now and am just working on my mental health. I've found that as I've been going through treatment that desire to seek attention has completely vanished. I still worry I might be doing the same thing with mental health conditions, but I talk with my treatment providers about that and they've pointed out that even thought they really don't think that's what I'm doing, if I were doing it that would be reason enough for treatment in itself, so no matter what I do need and deserve treatment.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to reiterate that I'm really happy to see this update and I wish OP and Lacy the best. I think OP's support and Lacy's honesty and willingness to look at her own problems is absolutely excellent and a good sign of things to come.",
            "Happy to hear she's getting help.",
            "Sometimes you need to hit your lowest point before you can begin to get better. I learned that the hard way last year. I also learned that people are more willing to offer you a hand than you'd think - Lacy, please don't hesitate to reach out to your loved ones in the future.\n\nBest of luck to you both.",
            "That's fantastic news.\n\nAnd I know it's cliched, but making the conscious decision to stop the cycle is the hardest part. The path of recovery won't be easy for sure, but having the intrinsic motivation to even begin the journey is more than enough to get that momentum going.\n\nStay strong and I wish you the best!",

            "When I was a kid, my cousin (who was a little older and more sportier) and me were playing on the monkey bars. After dark, she came home to huge blisters on her hands. My Aunty and mother both fawned over her injuries and waited on her, cared for her and she got all this special treatment. So the next day I set out for those monkey bars! I swung and rubbed my hands till I myself had some blisters forming. I run home to get this \"special treatment\" for myself. I was so ready to welcomed and cared for! I show them my trophies and wait for their reaction... Nothing.. \n\nNo special anything. So now I these dumb sores and stupid bubbles and no one cared. ",
            "Dear, sweet Lacy and dear OP. I hope all goes well for you. It might be a long road, but it sounds like you've both got your heads on straight and you have made a good start. Life can be really hard. Big hugs. ",

I used to hurt myself for attention because even though I was surrounded by people who loved me, depression can make you feel so lonely and worthless. I just want you to know that you're making the right choice by getting help. It does get better, even though it might not seem like it. You have a good man by your side and you're going to get through this. Hang in there!",

            "This is great to hear! Best of luck to the both of you. Lacey, it takes a lot of strength to get help. Really proud of you. You are definitely worth it. Just know that things can and will get better.  And OP, great job to you as well. \n\nTake care guys!!! xo",

            "I am so proud of her. Admitting to something like this, and seeking help is so incredibly courageous. I am so glad you guys talked, and are taking the steps in the right direction. It won't be easy, and there will be set backs, but that is not a \"bad\" thing. It is a process.  So happy about this update.",
            "I'm so so so glad this turned out the way it did. In OP's original post he mentioned something about Lacy being on reddit and the whole time I was reading I was thinking \"if my boyfriend posted something about me (assuming he used reddit & I was aware of it) I would probably notice my own name and story if I saw it...\" and I was a little worried about the repercussions of her seeing that but it happened and everything is going to be okay. Kudos for getting your shit together. ",
            "Fantastic!! She could look into something called behavioral cognitive therapy. To my understanding, its where a person learns to tie other emotions into their current actions, I.e. when I wake up without an alarm I either forgot to set one or I slept through all of them and I'm late -changed to - I woke up before my alarm because my body is refreshed and I am ready for the day. This is an example of something I actually did before I learned what it was called. Now I always wake up before my alarm even if by only moments. I can cite sources if it would help. Let me know. ",

            "It's wonderful that you've been supportive and understanding. Even not pushing therapy on her. Depression is such a complex thing that sometimes significant others can't really grasp it. Huge kuddos.",

            "I know it's more her thing than yours but keep up the support and get detailed updates as time goes on.  Sometimes, it's easy to want a happy ending but it's always a process to heal - sometimes she needs space and sometimes she needs confronting like what you did.",

Whatever she's going through is big and going through therapy alone is really, REALLY, tough.\n\nI'm sorry that she's feeling pain of some kind emotionally and acting it out physically. Lucy, if you are reading this please know that you are not alone. I'm here for you if you want to talk.

            "I still feel like you're still burying your head into the sand to cherrypick your narrow view of the world around you. And being here is not going to be helpful when everyone adopts a child-like perspective of your girlfriend's suffering or your 'recuse' as some warm and fuzzy romance fantasy.\n\nYour girlfriend is playing doctor by trying to diagnose and treat herself. If the imagery alone of your girlfriend suffering so much that she deals with her emotions by slamming the cold steel head hammer onto soft and supple human flesh does not disturb you enough to feel compelled to bring in professional advice, and not internet advice, then I don't know what you tell you. Lacy is clearly in pain right now and she deserves a sense of inner-peace and happiness just like the rest of us. I do not understand why you people believe she does not deserve professional help to work through this.\n\nPlease consider soliciting expert advice and not internet advice. We all know that anything not following the same warm and fuzzy narrative is going to be discarded and down-voted into oblivion. But even if you do continue to cherrypick, right now is still the opportune time to speak with a professional in a candid manner. \n\nYour girlfriend is diagnosing herself with depression while she continues allowing an unknown illness to progress further. It is a good idea to seek out professional aid as depression might not get better, it might get significantly worse on it's own, and there are more serious prospects in play here. Your girlfriend might not have depression at all. Have you ever entertained the thought that you really have no clue -what- disorder she is suffering with, only that she's asking for your help?\n\nSelf-harm is a cluster-b characteristic and that's a fact. If she displays four more of these characteristics then she meets the criteria for being diagnosed with an emotionally unstable personality disorder and not depression. Therefore, the treatment for depression that you two take alone, by yourselves from self-help books or the internet, is not going to be the same treatment that an actual clinician will give you.\n\nCaregiving in a relationship?\n\nThis is not a romance novel. Mental illness offers some very real, very painful struggles for both the person suffering and their loved ones. Unless you're willing to actually work with collaborative support from professionals, your circle of friends, outreach groups and peer support like NAMI, then you will not build the tools to be successful. Period. And with the way you come across with denial I can guess you'll keep building up stress after stress until it becomes too much, when you should be open to accept that there is nothing wrong with looking out for yourself on occasion.",
            "Instead of self harming, can we please please please call this self hammering?\n\nPS: I'm ecstatic she is choosing to get help. That is the first huge step and it having be HER choice shows that she has a great chance of getting through this with you. Best wishes.",

First of all, big apologies for how long overdue this update is. Since the rules limit me for one update only I wanted to have the most full outcome to give you. Thank you all so, so much for your help and support and advice, I didn't expect so many people to respond to me and I really am grateful.\n\nSadly the outcome isn't so happy. My conclusion from the original post was to go to highest management first and then police if the result wasn't satisfactory, which is what I did. \n\nI went straight to the store manager the morning after my post and was advised to write up and sign a formal grievance, which I did. I then met with two other managers to discuss the details of what happened and any other relevant stuff. They told me they'd talk to the manager in question and any witnesses and get back to me in a week after investigations had taken place. In the meantime, my manager was not allowed to work with me and was told to reschedule all his shifts or work elsewhere. \n\nA week passed and I heard nothing. When I went to find out, apparently due to staff holidays it couldn't be completed in time. I asked how much longer and was told a week. I felt this was too long and was really restless by this point already and so my boyfriend came with me to speak to the police. \n\nWe explained the situation and my details were taken down and then we met with a sergeant. To summarise, she told us that in the UK there is no specific law against accessing someone's private phone/recording off someone's private phone without permission. As such, they are unable to search his phone as no arrests can be made. The only thing they could do was go to his house and explain it had been reported and that if he ever distributed it he would be arrested, which they did, and he LIED TO THE POLICE and said he hadn't done anything. Sadly, they said there was nothing more they could do.\n\nThe internal investigation then concluded and I was told my manager had denied everything, made up a false excuse for the apology text he sent me and basically called me a liar. They told me that there is no CCTV where it happened and nobody who was in the area at the time saw anything (no shit, they were the complete opposite end of the room, as I had already explained). They tried to say they weren't taking sides, but to be honest it seemed like they were. They're moving ME from the department instead of him, because moving him is \"harder\". I really enjoyed my job and now basically I have to suffer because my manager is a disgusting liar. They don't seem to care how serious this is. I ended up almost crying when they legitimately said \"maybe you didn't see anything at all\". I feel like they're accusing me of lying and imagining it, even though one of the managers involved was the one that caught me in the corridor bawling my eyes out.\n\nI really wish I could've given a happy update. I'm so upset that I have to move and give up something I enjoy when he gets off without even a slap on the wrist, goes on knowing he can probably do this again to someone else and carry on being the scumbag he is, not to mention, he might still have the videos. He may have distributed them already but how the hell would I know. I have no idea what to do now. The police say nothing else can be done. If anyone has any legal advice around this issue within the UK law then I would be very very grateful for that. \n\nSorry for the length, and if it's worded badly. Again, thank you all for your advice. I'm sorry this was a bad update.\n\ntl;dr: Went to higher management and police about how I caught my manager recording a private video from my phone to his phone. He lied to both; management say not enough evidence to do anything, he gets to keep his job but I have to lose mine. Police say nothing can be done due to no UK law surrounding the subject.\n\n",

            "OP - I work for a large corporate in the UK.  I'm not a lawyer.  There are a few things you could consider doing:\n\n- as others have said, contact a local lawyer who specialises in employment law.  Seriously, this is the most important thing to do. Although the company appears to have followed it's internal policies on grievances you still have several options, ultimately including quitting and suing for constructive dismissal based on gender discrimination.  At the very least, contact from an employment lawyer will terrify the store and you may well see corrective action immediately.  Settlements for gender discrimination are uncapped in the UK (unlike unfair dismissal, for example) and companies are very wary of cases like this.\n\n- In the meantime, make a note of all situations which have made you uncomfortable while working at the store - you mentioned in your previous post discussions about attractiveness of other female employees and your boss letting you know he found you attractive.  Both can and generally would be considered harassment.   Discuss these with the lawyer as well.\n\n- make sure you have a written record of the grievance judgement and ask for one if it hasn't been provided.  Make it clear in writing that you are unhappy with the outcome, especially the transfer - which feels like punishment for raising a grievance against your male manager who has harassed you.\n\n- check the employee handbook to see if they have an appeal procedure and if so lodge an appeal\n\n- If your store is part of a chain and has a corporate HQ, ask HR in your store how you can escalate to corporate HR.\n\n- In general, in your communications with HR locally and beyond, make it clear that you feel like you are being harassed, discriminated against and punished because of your gender.  Which should be easy, because you clearly are.\n\nBut first, get a lawyer.  The company absolutely will not want to defend a case like this - if it were to go to a tribunal it would be a disaster for them - and I doubt they will stand by a creepy manager once a lawyer is involved.\n\nedit: link removed.

Because you've been reassigned, I'd recommend going to talk to an employment attorney, or if your city/township has an Equal Employment office, go talk to them. Equal Employment office, you can file a complaint and the company will have to defend their actions to a 3rd party.

One thing led to another, we were having sex on my bed. The sex was very good, but that level of intimacy with her was amazing, like something I had never experienced before in my life. After sex she laid on top of me and told me that this was her first time having sex and she's glad that it was with the right person. We slept in each other's arms. This morning I drove her home and when we arrived she kissed me and told me that she's glad that last night finally happened.\n\nI'm a little overwhelmed. On one hand I certainly love her and last night felt very right when it was happening, on the other hand I can't shake off this feeling of guilt that I'm having right now. I feel like she's been more or less isolated in her life because of her physical condition and I'm the first person who's really been her friend and she's opening up to me like that, not maybe because I'm the right one for her or that I deserve her but because I'm the only option. I feel like I'm taking advantage of her.\n\nI don't know what I should do. Are my thoughts valid? \n   \n**tl;dr**: Me with best friend who is disabled. We had sex and I feel like I took advantage of her because I'm her only close friend.",

            "For the love of Pete, do NOT let her know how you're overthinking this.  You might want to ask if that was an impulse or just how she feels about you.\n\nIf you enjoyed it don't screw it up.  Sounds like she was happy about it.\n\nI mean if she initiated, was intimate, holding your hand, etc. that's a pretty clear sign she's into you.  You done got seduced son.  \n\nIf you're lucky you just took the first step down the path from friend to partner.\n\nMay very well be she's had feelings for you for a while.\n\nPlus only having one close friend...if she's an introvert that's perfectly normal.  \n\nIntrovert doesn't mean shy, it means you don't need or even want a lot of close relationships.  Other people are draining.  You can be friendly, the life of the party, sociable, entertaining, but only so much.\n\nYou're perfectly content just being alone or sometimes with a chosen partner.\n\nExtroverts thrive on socialization. Introverts enjoy socialization, but need time away.\n",

If she says that she wants to pursue something, don't second guess her, she is capable of taking care of herself in this respect.\n\nThat being said, it may still be productive for both of you to talk about this, but don't do so in such a manner that it seems like the continuation of the relationship is contingent upon this concern being addressed.  Ask her if she's okay with this, tell her how you feel, and let her tell you that it's alright.  If she does, believe her, she the best authority in this regard.",

You say being intimate with her felt right, trust your instincts and let her trust hers.\n\nShe trusts you. Her family trust you. It's not because you're her only friend, it's because you're a great friend and a trustworthy person. You deserve her. Don't overthink it.",

            "From what you are saying, it sounds like both of you are lucky that they found each other. The connection you have is rare. She wouldn't have felt that with \"any\" other person she would have met. \nI would understand your guilt if you didn't feel anything towards her and had manipulated her in order to have sex.

I have a couple of disabled friends and as unneeded and patronizing as it is, I do feel very protective of them. Perhaps that combined with what happened last night and the ensuing feelings/hormone rushes is just fucking you up a bit? \n\nShe's happy, you're happy, this sounds like a good thing that could go places, nothing you're saying is coming off as you taking advantage of her or anything of the sort. \n\nStop worrying and start planning a nice date for you guys or something.

            "I am going to try to come at it from a different point of view.  People treat disabled people differently.  If its a physical disability, there is literally no reason to treat them different beyond reasonable accommodation (ramp for wheel chairs, but no you don't carry them in unless asked).  You were probably one of the FEW people who treated her like a NORMAL person, like she has a brain and her disability ISN\"T contagious.  That creates a special bond for some people, and is very precious.  \n\nAlso,  even if nothing else goes further in your relationship, the reason your sex was SO right is because you both genuinely cared for the other person.  You've developed a great friend relationship.  If you are both ready, its okay to take to next step.  (just because she can't walk, doesn't mean she lost all feeling down there etc.)\n\nEdit:  Just wanted to  add in answer to your question: NO you are not taking advantage of her.  She knew what she was doing, and seduced you.  If you are happy with the idea of having a relationship with her, GO FOR IT!\nExperience: Best friend is physically handicapped, she has been happily married for 12 years.",
            "With the title, I assumed you meant mentally disabled, so I'm very glad that I was deceived...\n\nThat being said, it's 2016. We've long since retired the word \"cripple\" and get the pity out of your head. She's an adult, you're an adult. **Live, Love, Be Happy.**\n\n### You found someone that makes you feel special.\n\nHold on to her as long as you can. Let her know how she makes you feel. Buy her flowers for no reason. Apologize when you do something wrong. Treat her as you would wish someone would treat your daughter.\n\n\n\n",
            "\"The sex was very good, but that level of intimacy with her was amazing, like something I had never experienced before in my life.\"\n\nI think this says it all. Don't overthink it, just go with it. Just because she's disabled doesn't mean you had sex with her out of pity. It sounds pretty well like you had sex with her because you are attracted to her as a person. ",
            "Even though she's disabled, her heart and her mind are working fine. Even if she was isolated for a lot of her life, she still has human needs and desires. Just because she was disadvantaged in a few ways in her life doesn't mean that you're taking advantage of her by default - she wanted this.\n\nIf last night was what you both wanted, then it was good and right. If she's happy, don't sweat it - you know you had no predatory designs on her, and you know you both had fun. \n\nJust let what happens happen.

You love someone, that person loves you back. \nRemind yourself she is an adult, capable of forming relationships with who she wants to. This came from a friendship that seemed to be loving, fun, and caring. Sounds like you both fell in love with your bestfriend; kind of what everyone in the universe hopes for!",
            "Her mind is fine, she consented to the sex. By the sounds of things, she initiated it. Please don't question her choices just because she uses a wheelchair. To her, that's normal. Her chair and its routines are part of her life. She has agency to say yes or no like anyone else, for her own reasons. It's not up to you to imagine how she SHOULD feel. She shouldn't need to be shamed for having a sexuality. If you feel guilty those are YOUR feelings and its ok to have them, but don't look at her as Poor Lana In A Wheelchair, because that's not friendship.",
            "Wow, I was expecting something pretty terrible based on your title, but instead I found a post where you're really conscientious and thoughtful. \n  \nYour concerns are very valid. When all the happy feelings where off, you'll eventually sit down and have a talk with her about what kind of relationship you want to have going forward. That would be an excellent time to bring up your feelings. She'll probably reassure you, and you should be receptive to that. ",

            ">that level of intimacy with her was amazing, like something I had never experienced before in my life.\n\nThere is a song out there by Tim McGraw with the lyric \"'I love you' ain't no pick up line.\"  It's true, sex really is different when you are with someone you care about and who cares about you.\n\nLet your worries go, she is a full grown adult who knows what she wants and got it.  You happen to be it, so enjoy.  \n\nOne question though. Other then the \"taking advantage\" fear, how are you on a full relationship with her?  You said you saw her as a cousin.  Don't forget that just as much as her being somewhat isolated isn't a reason to stop, its also not a reason to force yourself to do it.  I really hope this last paragraph is unnecessary, because your post is cute as fuck and I think everyone here wants you to update in a year about your engagment.  But don't feel like you are trapped because of this either, if its not what you want.",
            "Holy shit, this sounds like the beginning of a romantic comedy. A rather good one.",
            "It is a beautiful thing, being in love with your best friend. You even note how amazing the level of intimacy is during sex. This can be your whole life, if you want it. You can second-guess everything, but really you only need to look at how you feel and how she feels.\n\nTo echo the theme of the advice given here, all you have to do is just let it happen.\n\nThank you for sharing; you've made my day.",
            "You could always look at her as being lucky. She lost her virginity to her best friend, someone she could trust, a person she loves. A lot of people these days don't get that their first time. She gets to know that the first time she had sex wasn't with someone who was just using her, but someone who'd stuck by her through everything.\n\nIt sounds like she initiated and both of you were extremely happy during and after. It's sweet of you to consider her feelings, but as many people have commented: her mind is as a consenting adult. She knew what she was doing and she wanted it bad enough to go after it.",
            "Don't let the world steal a good thing from you. Be selfish and keep her for yourself. Just start dating her.",
            "You sound like a really lovely person, she's lucky. You're lucky. Enjoy it. \n\nJust an observation but if you didn't care so much for her you wouldn't care about this issue. I think it's a legit thing to consider but let it wash past and just enjoy each other. I wish you both all the very best. ",
            "I want to write my own. My ex (Year and a half relationship) was disabled in their legs too. She would often ask me to move her body during sex as she couldn't.\n\nBeyond that (and the obvious restrictions of different positions) nothing at all was different from a normal relationship. Fully sound-minded adults who fell in love. \n\nWe broke up due to different levels of activity (Be that a cause of the disability or her personality I don't know because we would still go out) but her disability from a 'I feel guilty about her' was not an issue after the first month. I truly fell for her for who she was.\n\nYou aren't taking advantage of her. People are naturally socially awkward, shy or etc. I think you're pitying her due to the disability when really you have perfect relationship potential infront of you. \n\nIt won't be easy to navigate (there were some caregiving actions I did for my ex) but obviously no relationship is without trials. Give it a shot if that is what you are feeling. You aren't taking advantage of her at all!\n",
            "You obviously have a huge amount of feelings for her, even if you don't completely recognise what those feelings are are yet. Don't put too much pressure on yourself, and just let the connection grow into what it's going to be. You're a great guy, she came onto you as well as you coming onto her, and it sounds like it was an incredible night.\n\nStay respectful, stay true to yourself, and stay positive and let the good stuff happen.

            "you sound like you feel bad that you had sex with her because she is different.\n\nas long as it was consensual, you have nothing to feel bad about.\n\n you don't owe her a serious relationship just cause you had sex with her, but you should most definitely talk to her about what this means for both of you.\n\ntalk to her like any other partner and be honest, don't let her circumstances guilt you into staying or having a relationship that you are not 100% happy about. ",
            "How do you feel like you took advantage of her? She is an adult like you, capable of making her own decisions. You didn't use your friendship as a tool to get her into bed. It actually sounds like things happened that night exactly as she wanted them to happen. She was likely looking forward to making a move on you, possibly had even planned it a little.\n\nStop overthinking it and just enjoy what you have.",
            "Just remember that any disabled person is more than just their disability. What happened was a wonderful thing. Everyone needs love and affection. Be that for her.",
            "It does not sound like you are taking advantage or her. \n\nIf you are happy, she is happy, and hell, even her family is happy, what is the problem?\n\nYou both clearly love each other, have a happy relationship",
            "She is a grown woman. You didn't take advantage of her. She chose to be intimate with you because she trusts you and more than likely loves you. Just because she has a disability does not mean she needs constant pity or to be treated any different from any body else. ",
            "Dude!  You are very clearly head over heels for this girl - and by the sounds of it, she for you.  Stop worrying and thinking about it so much, go enjoy your relationship with her and hopefully it only blossoms from here.  ",
            "Look she had a good time with someone she could trust and wasn't going to hurt her. This is a win/win as first times go. \n\nBigger issue, you like her she's fun and you never thought of dating her? Is it just because of her disability? You should probably unpack that because my guess is she's had a crush on you and thinks this is a start of a relationship. If you don't think it's a relationship you need to figure that out and tell her ASAP. It will likely ruin the friendship but better sooner than later. ",
            "> The sex was very good, but that level of intimacy with her was amazing, like something I had never experienced before in my life.\n\nRun with this. It's incredibly sweet and special.

            "Nobody's addressing you feeling \"overwhelmed\" but I think it's valid and warrants some quiet reflection. That sounds like a powerful experience, why not take some time to let it sink in.",
            "She is physically disabled, not mentally. \n\nIn no way were you taking advantage of her since she was clearly expressing interest. \n\nI think this is the struggle people with disabilities have. All the good people avoid them for fear of being judged so that leaves them with bad people who could care less about the moral dilema. ",
            "It sounds like she did the majority of the initiating (good for her!) and that is definitely YES YES YES I GIVE CONSENT LETS DO THIS kind of stuff. You did nothing wrong!

            "She is an adult and she doesn't sound mentally incapable of giving consent in any way. It also sounds like you have some deep emotions for her that could be able to grow, if that's what you both want. I don't read anything here that makes me think either of you did anything wrong. \nBeing disabled doesn't make her any less deserving of a healthy sex life than anyone else and it doesn't mean that you took advantage of her either.\nYou two should have a talk about whether you want this to become something long term and what kind of relationship you both want, but there is no need for you to feel guilty for expressing yourself sexually with someone who fully consented, participated and was happy to have sex with you. \n",
            "Your thoughts are not fully valid because you seem like you really like her, perhaps even love her. You should talk to her and ask if she thinks you took advantage of her.

It can be a little intimidating at first because you don't want to screw anything up, and you're afraid that you're taking advantage of her. Well, you're not. She's in control of all her mental faculties, she's just like you and me, except you moves around in a different way. Don't let it get in your head, have fun, and I hope you two end up having a great future. ",
            "If you are interested in her, I say go for it. She may have been a little isolated, but she isnt mentally disabled. Shes a big girl and can make that decision for herself. Dont feel guilty about enjoying someone because they have a disability. ",

That's pretty obviously not the case, here! You care about her and she cares about you, it sounds like the two of you have something special. I'd just go with it and see where it leads. ",
            "Dude treat her like a real person, and acknowledge her agency.  You guys are obviously in love.  There is no \"taking advantage\" here, and suggesting there is is kinda patronising.",
            "As someone that has often distanced myself from people and never been able to maintain long term friendships, I'd like to say you could just as easily be her first real friend BECAUSE she feels you're right for her, and not the other way around. My boyfriend is my best friend because I think he's amazing, and I don't just think he's amazing because he's my best friend. ",
            "Finding the right person to open up to is generally hard, she found that in you, and it seems that she does that for you too as you seem to have accepted intimacy with her with open arms.\n\nAs for your doubts. I think they are natural, but they also don't give your friend enough credit. She may be disabled and had many difficulties in her life, but that does not mean that she is incapable of knowing when she is loved. If anything, the challenges she had to overcome probably thought her to better appreciate people who accept her, and made her more capable of accepting others for who they are. That is not easily found, and in that respect, you are very lucky.\n\nRelax and give it a go, enjoy it.",

I worry about that a bit. \n\nI'm so happy for both of you, so enough of the guilt now! ",
            "She's still a grown woman with her own bodily autonomy and sexual agency.

You say you are the first person who's really been her friend, and now her first \"true love\".\n\nWhile you may be in love with her now, there is no telling yet where the relationship will lead in the future. Even now she seems to be kinda dependent on you, which will only grow worse in a relationship.\n\nYou are not taking advantage of her now. However, the whole situation is set up for a huge asymmetry in commitment and emotional dependence.\n\nSo what's going to happen if eventually you decide that the relationship doesn't work for you anymore? You can do this in normal relationships. Could you do this with her?",

            "I think the fact that she prefers to hangout with you you see yourself as her ONLY friend, but in reality she doesn't put energy into other people, she only seeks u out (to study or hangout). Therefore u think she can't make friends because of her disability but in reality she separate herself from otherssss because she likes you. \n\nMy work has disable people and I treat them as normal as possible, I'm actually nicer toward them and more accepting than the none-disable people so ur idea of her not being able to make friends because her disability is untrue.",

Ignoring the disabled part, she is still someone who is sexually/  socially inexperienced, and her experience with you *is* formative. \n\nThat is a responsibility & a burden, and you are rightly concerned about bearing it. \n\nAgain, leaving aside your feeling of whether you took advantage of her due to her disability, if you enjoyed the experience, and want to continue having sex with her (and her with you, of course) while staying friends or evolving your relationship to be more romantic in nature, then do so. \n\nIf you didn't enjoy it or don't want to have that type of relationship with her, for *whatever reason*, then talk to her about just being non sexual friends again, or stop being friends with her. \n\nShe is an adult woman who can exercise her own initiative.

But either way, it's not your responsibility to make sure she has a full social life. Your  only responsibility is to your relationship with her, and it sounds like a great relationship. \n\nWhat it sounds like is actually going on is that your relationship with your friend has changed and you're not sure what to do or how you feel about it.

            "Hey man, I would first like to agree with everyone here and say that it sounds like you two have found each other in this crazy world - and that what you have is truly a beautiful thing. Honestly, I was grinning happily the entire time I read this post (okay, not the part where you are sad, but you get the picture).\n\nI'd also like to add something else. While I am not disabled, I am an introvert and was always sort of unpopular all through my teens. I usually had one close friend at a time (which was fine by me, being an introvert), and even though I had intense crushes from time to time, they never amounted to anything.\n\nI fell in love with (and married! though that point for you is sometime in the future of course) the first guy I ever was in a true relationship with. Looking back, I realize now that us being close friends for a long time before we actually got together is what made me realize that we could be something more. We already had a trusting and amazing relationship even before our first kiss, before our first real make-out, before our first time having sex. And I'm so glad for that. I feel like I was able to hand-pick my partner for life, because I really got to know him and care for him platonically before anything else. And it sounds like you, too, are in such a position.\n\nNot everyone falls in love with their best friend, and that's okay. Sometimes the one they end up with is someone new and unexpected. But for you, and for me, it seems that we found that special someone and learned to treasure them in a wholly platonic way, only to fall in love with them later on and see them as something more. To build a romantic relationship on top of such a strong friendship is truly amazing.\n\nTrust your initial instinct that this feels right. You felt amazing (and it sounds like she did, too!) for a reason, and it's clear to those looking in that you're very much in love and well-suited for each other. I ask you to take a breath and let what happened sink in. It is real. Wherever this relationship goes, whether it lasts a lifetime or a few wonderful weeks, let it happen.

Just talk to her. If you really do like her, and her disability has been the wall between you and any sexual or romantic feelings for her, that was obviously broken down by what happened last night. Ask her how she feels and thinks about it. Any awkwardness in such a conversation is forgivable, you don't have to be James Bond. **Absolutely do not convey in any way, shape, or form that her disability was a significant factor in this whole thing.

Besides, love is de facto a \"you're special and that's why I have feelings for you\" kind of thing, so asking if it's all right that she has feelings for you because you are special is a bit over thinking it, isn't it? She is a paraplegic, not comatose. She can think for herself, and she did. Accept her feelings and decide on those of your own: are they the same? Just make sure you answer that last question without weighing in the disability. It's about the person inside the body, not about the body.\n\nOn a side note, if you love her so much, why are you asking Reddit? Just tell her you're worried about her and use the line above if you need (the 'you might be doing it for the wrong reasons' one). She ought only to admire your worries for her well-being, IMHO. Best case scenario: she considers your worries, contemplates the notion, and then decides in full awareness to stick to her plan and hook up with you.\n\n**TL;DR**: you're over thinking it. Stahp.

My fianc\u00e9 is missing a hand (born that way) and when we first started dating my first instinct was to offer to help him with things that I personally don't think I could do with one hand (like cut his meat for him.) It wasn't out of any feelings of, like, contempt for his abilities or anything like that. I was more coming at it from the position of \"if I broke my hand and couldn't use it, I would be grateful for someone who wanted to help me.\" But that's the wrong way to think about it; if you break your hand or legs, that's usually temporary, so you may not ever have to develop the skills to deal with it, where as someone with a long term disability may well have figured it out a long time ago and be offended that you think they can't do something. I never acted on my impulses to be helpful, instead I took a \"wait and see\" approach meaning to wait and see how he reacts to it, and if he asks for my help or seems to really be struggling with it, then help or offer to. Turns out, he doesn't need my help with shit. Forget cutting his own meat and tying his own shoes, dude can do everything I can do and then some. He's got it handled. He also (much later in our relationship) told me that he was so upset one time when he was like 18 and his grandpa asked him if he could tie his shoes. Glad I didn't ask about cutting his meat on that second date! Point being, don't underestimate her or think that you know her limits or what she's capable of. Let her show you her limits.

I think disability is a bad way to describe it, my GF cant walk, but she has done more in life than most people i know, and it sounds like your friend is the same way. When describing people in wheelchairs stol the description at people. The chair is not important. The lack of mobility does lead to some issues with self esteem in dealing with limitations, but also creates very strong people. Im not sure if your feeljng of guilt comes from her being in a chair or the fact you had seen her as a friend. Either way she sounds like an amazing girl and you seem to care for her a lot. The person youre in a relationship should be your best friend. Also, just because she is in a chair doesnt mean that she wants or enjoys sex any less, trust me, my girlfriend loves sex and is great at it.

        "selftext": "Hi reddit. My fiancee Ali and I have been together for 4 years, living together for 2, recently got engaged. Our relationship has been great for the most part, one of the few things we disagree on is animals. I love animals and Ali feels indifferent towards most animals. \n\nTo give a little background about me - I've always been an animal lover. Throughout my childhood, my mom hated animals, especially dogs. My mom never let us have any pets and she used to tell us that once we were adults we could have whatever animals we wanted. \n\nWhen I moved away for college, I lived on campus for 4 years (and therefore couldn't have any pets). I've wanted a dog for as long as I could remember, but up until recently it wasn't in the cards for me to have a dog. Ali and I currently live in a not-so-pet-friendly city for renters. I always lived in apartments that never allowed pets, even with a pet deposit. \n\nWhen Ali and I met I told her about wanting to get a dog someday. Ali told me that she doesn't like a lot of dogs, but would be open to the right dog. This was in the very beginning of us meeting - I basically made it really clear that I will own a dog one day.\n\nThroughout our relationship, I would occasionally bring up wanting a dog. Ali would remind me that our apartment doesn't allow for pets (which was true). Ali and I agreed that once we moved into a place that allowed for pets, we would look into getting a dog. \n\nAbout 2 months ago Ali and I moved into a house just outside of the city we work in. The house is a good size for the 2 of us (plus extra), the landlord is pet-friendly, and the house has a huge, fenced in yard. It's a much more residential area, and there's a dog park about 3 blocks from the house. \n\nOn top of the house being perfect for a dog, I'm in a financial place where I can afford a dog. I make very good money and I don't have to travel for work. I'm mentally prepared for potential pet fees and other expenses for having people watch the dog. \n\nSince we're finally settled in the house, I decided to mention to Ali again about going to the shelter and looking at the adoptable dogs. Only this time, Ali didn't have an excuse for why we couldn't get one. After a few weak excuses (i.e. sometimes we go away), Ali broke down and told me that she doesn't want a dog. In fact, she's never wanted a dog. She was hoping I would forget about my dreams of wanting a dog. \n\nI'm not sure what to do. I'm trying to reason with Ali but she said her answer will always be \"no\" to a dog. She just doesn't like them and doesn't want them. She basically gave me an ultimatum - either her, or my potential dog. \n\nI'm feeling shitty about this, because I always made it clear to her that I was going to want a dog someday. I feel like she was banking on something unrealistic, and now she's putting me in a lousy spot. \n\nIs there a way to compromise on this? \n\nTL;DR - Girlfriend and I can finally get a dog, she admitted that she doesn't want a dog and never has. She gave me an ultimatum - either her or a dog. \n\n\n",

            "I never wanted a dog but my husband did. I agreed to getting one because it was important to him. Our agreement was that he takes care of all dog related things. The dog whines to go out at 2am? My husband gets up and deals with it. He vomits on the floor? Still husband's job. I've grow to adore the dog too and now help out more, but knowing that I didn't have to deal with the bulk of the issues really helped me adjust. I can't say this will work for you, but maybe there is a way to compromise here. Maybe she's afraid of the upkeep and cleaning? I understand being upset she lied and don't blame you if this is a deal breaker. If you are open to discussing it, I would just suggest seeing why she doesn't want a dog. ",
            "I think the bigger issue is the way she communicates and has basically lied to you about something that is really important to you.  It is a big breach of trust.  I think that is something that needs to be considered carefully. \n\nShe has now put you in the horrible position of being \"the bad guy\" who she would tell people picked a \"dog\" over her!  When the reality is that she has intentionally misled you about something that she knows is very important to you - or at best, completely discounted something that is very important to you.  She isn't treating you with respect or like a partner.  ",

And now that she's confronted with her lies, she gets to act like you're being petty and choosing an imaginary pet over the woman you asked to spend the rest of your life with.\n\nYou either stay and give in to her long con, never getting your dog, or you break up and she gets a sob story about how she was dumped for a hypothetical dog.\n\nHave you ever seen this type of behavior from her before? Has she been passive aggressive or manipulative or uncommunicative before now? If not, it may be that she agreed early on because she didn't want to jeopardize things and didn't realize how much it meant to you until it was too late, and then just completely mishandled things.\n\nIf she has, then this is just a bigger example of what a manipulative asshole you're engaged to. \n\nI hope it's the former, but the fact that she won't discuss it and she put an ultimatum on you to force you into doing what she wants is a big red flag that suggests the latter.

She basically manipulated you by lying about being agreeable to a dog, knowing full well she really doesn't like them.  I don't take well to manipulation myself.  Do you?",
            "She pulled a really hurtful long con on you.  She lied to you for years and years just so you would stay with her.  That's incredibly unhealthy for a relationship.  It doesn't matter what she lied about.  She has terrible communication techniques and lied to you for years.  I would never be able to get over that.  What else is she willing to lie about in order to get you to stay with her? ",
            "My life is animals so I completely understand your love. I have two dogs and work with dogs and cats for a living. I also had to wait to get a dog until my life settled. I would have been devastated if my husband switched on me like that. Loving animals is a deal breaker for me. It's a fundamental and very important thing for me. \n\nBreaking things off wouldn't really be about the dog. It would be about lying and fundamental differences in how you want to live your life. I see it no different than lying about wanting children. Both require a certain type of lifestyle and responsibility that not everyone wants. ",
            "Dog stuff aside, she is not a woman who is ready to be a wife. \n\nThis is her major conflict resolution strategy. Tell half truths/lie, avoid, and hope her partner changes (drops) common reasonable and mainstream things about himself. \n\nI love dogs but I do not want to own one in the city. It's just so much more of a micromanaging responsibility. If I shacked up with an urban dog owner I'd be very up front about not wanting dog responsibility. No poop and scoops, no walks, and I would prefer to stay later at parties if good times are still flowing if he had to go walk the dog and be responsible. \n\nThe misrepresentation of her stance and enthusiasm super sucks and has complicated problems. But, I personally feel that cohabitating with your dog that you're responsible for seems like a good compromise. ",

What else has she done this on?  How would you feel if she'd done this about kids? If she'd lied to you about being open to one day having kids, would you be willing to stay with her?  \n\nIs it REALLY any different? It's not WHAT she deceived you over, its' the fact that she felt it was perfectly acceptable to string you along and lie to you, only to say, I've been lying the whole time and now you have to choose, me or the thing you've been totally upfront from the beginning about wanting in your life. \n\nThere's no compromise. She agrees to get a dog or you dump her like the lying piece of trash she is. I wouldn't even give her the option of keeping her word.  She's deceived you all the way down the line. ",
            "I am a huge dog lover. All of the compromises I can think of (get another animal, volunteer at a pet shelter, etc) really pale in comparison to having your own dog. I wasn't in a position to own a dog until I was 22 and it was always my dream. I have literally broken up with someone because they didn't like my (very cute, well behaved) dog. \n\nPets are important and you made it clear this was important to you. She lied and lead you on and hoped to dissuade you from something important to you. \n\nGood luck with your new dog!",
            "Have you asked her what her reasons are for not liking them?  For some people it can be fur (poodles don't shed or if they do its not noticeable I've ever seen it)  could be the chewing (can adopt an older dog that's outgrown the phase)  could be that they are always moving (look at breeds)  could be that is the work (you make sure she knows she won't have to take care of it) basically what I'm saying is,  talk to her about her reasons and see if it's something you could work on a compromise with you getting your dog and her not getting the part she doesn't like.

            "This might be a silly suggestion, but what if you did some volunteering with a rescue group to expose her to dogs more slowly and show that you are serious about the responsibility? After some time, maybe she will agree to temporary fostering.  If she will agree to it on a trial basis with no commitment she might change her mind. If her mind doesn't change, then at least a few dogs will be walked or one might have a bit of a break from living in a cage, and you will know for sure that it won't work out.\n\nI have said no to dogs in my relationship before because I know the level of responsibility and the limit it places on your day to day flexibility. It does suck that you guys aren't on the same page about this though.",

I think they're messy, smelly, always needing attention, expensive: just not good for me, but I was honest.\n\nThe thing is, she can decide not to want a dog. She shouldn't be made to feel like a bad person because she doesn't.\n\n*But* you can decide to not be with someone who cannot fulfill a part of your happiness and you shouldn't feel like a bad person because you do.\n\nI'd say the bigger flag is she was terrible at communicating this. You've spent 4 years on a relationship that may be undone because she wasn't 100% unfront and honest. That would not be a deal breaker for me, but I don't want a dog at all, ever. I'd say weigh the pros and cons of staying together and then weigh that against how likely it is that she can learn to communicate better. If you choose to stay together, remember compromise isn't a weakness. If you choose to end things, I hope you get the best doggy ever.\n\nTL;DR You shouldn't feel bad, but not wanting a dog doesn't make her a bad person. She'll need to learn to communicate waaaay better if you're going to work.",

            "When you initially brought it up at the beginning of the relationship and she didn't enthusiastically agree with you about the idea of a dog, you shouldn't have taken that for what it was: a hesitant maybe. I'm surprised you're blindsided by this decision. It sounds like, in your eagerness, you have projected your own desires onto her. Everyone is saying she outright lied to you, but I feel like that might not be as cut and dry. It sounds like she gave you middle of the road answers to pacify you, but was also vocal about being hesitant. A common way people do this is to frame it in a way that removes themselves from the equation, ex: we can't have a dog because of our apartment. \n\nSince it sounds like there was no room for negotiation on this subject, I can't say I blame her necessarily, though I have to agree with others that this is not healthy communication. It's your call whether you end the relationship over this (which is perfectly reasonable). My only question is that if this was relationship breaker all those years ago, did you explicitly say so? If so, why did you choose to stay with her over a tentative and hypothetical maybe? ",
            "I don't know, guys. It seems to me that, though he was clear he HOPED to have a dog one day, she never promised to get one.

Everyone screeching about her \"lying\" to you don't know how you phrased it, or how she phrased it. I highly doubt she knew it would be such a huge dealbreaker for you, like ABSOLUTE END OF THE RELATIONSHIP dealbreaker. \n\nTo people who don't like dogs, \"I want a dog someday\" doesn't exactly sound binding. \n\nI'd talk to her more. Seriously, you love this woman. Surely you can find a compromise. Depending on where you live, maybe you can have an \"outdoor\" dog.

Again, not lying, maybe she could have been clearer that the problem wasn't the apartment it was the concept of the dog. \n\nThen she said that you could *look into* getting a dog when you moved into a better place. Again she's hardly singing dog's praises. But again poor wording. \n\nI'm not telling you which way to go. Only you know that, but I just think people are being way too mean about your girlfriend here. She hasn't been super clear the whole time but it's pretty obvious she hasn't ever wanted a dog.

            "Yea, this would be a deal breaker for me. I love cats. My last one died while I was in school and I thought it was best to wait until I had moved and found a job. Then I met my girlfriend. For a variety of reasons, we had to decide fairly early on if there was any potential to our relationship. We talked about a lot of things to make sure we were generally on the same page. We talked some about some very serious topics-marriage, religion, kids, money, career goals, geographic goals, health, etc. But one topic I made sure to broach was cats. I made it clear that I'd loved cats long before her, that I would get a cat no matter what, and that I wanted one as soon as possible. Like you, I'm reasonable. There have been some close calls at some pet stores (rescues, not kittens bred for sale), but we still don't have a cat because it's not practical with our current life. However, if my girlfriend were to tell me that she'd never be okay with a cat, I would break up with her instantly (and then move and immediately get a cat). I would feel betrayed and duped. I would also not be okay with giving up on my dreams of having many cats over my lifetime. Your girlfriend should have been honest with you from the beginning and let you decide then if you were still interested in dating her. Instead she deceived you. Do you know what pets are really great for? Giving you cuddles and a distraction when you're getting over a break up! Go get yourself a dog! ",

I don't think you should break up with her just based off of this. I would talk to her, figure out why she doesn't like dogs, see if there's a compromise that can be reached. Maybe she had a bad experience with dogs in her childhood, maybe she was never exposed to them so she doesn't understand why you want one so badly, but you won't know until you talk to her. And if that doesn't work and you feel like you can't be in a relationship with her anymore then break up with her. \n\nBut you gotta talk to her first. She lied about being ok with a dog. In all fairness, that sucks, but on a list of horrible deceitful things, it's nowhere near the top. ",
            "Here's my take on it. It's not going to be the popular one because reddit loves dogs and telling people to break up, but here it is anyway. \n\nShe's your fiance. You've pledged to marry her, which means you intend to spend the rest of your life with her. You want her to be a part of your family,until you die. If you're willing to break up with her over a dog that you don't have, especially when you've never had a dog and may not even like it when you actually do, I don't think your relationship with her was that strong to begin with and you should consider the commitment you're about to make. It would be different if you already had a dog and she said you had to get rid of it, or if your dog died and she doesn't want another. But you've never had a dog at all. \n\nHOWEVER, if you're thinking of breaking up with her because she deceived you and disregarded your wants and needs, that's a valid reason to explore breaking up with her. \n\nBut you gotta be honest about why. You can't use the latter as an excuse for the former. If you're really just mad that she won't let you get a dog, you seriously gotta think about what marriage actually means to you. \n\nAnyway, good luck. ",
            "There will be no good result if you compromise with a person who doesn't like dogs. If you still get a dog, there's no guarantee your dog will be treated right by your fiancee. I will probably get downvoted for this but don't compromise especially when there is another life involved. Based on experience, the person who doesn't like dogs will do everything to get rid of it.

I am a busy, career driven person, and my cat is the max care I can deal with (and you can leave her alone at home with food for up to 4 days).  I don't like picking up poop, or needing to come home or arrange for something every day.  I don't like piles of fur all over everything.\n\nBut I fell in love with a guy with a dog, and he is an extremely lovable dog, well behaved, one of the best trained I've seen, and an angel.  \nWe are married now.  The dog is very sweet.  \n\nBUT, all the grossness and things I was afraid of about dogs has come to a head.  My husband is simply just not bothered by the smelliness, constant hair on the ground, and shit in the yard.  I'm the sole gardener, and i'm constantly having to step over piles of uncleaned dog shit, there will be 20-30 giant piles of poo in the yard before I snap and finally nag him.  The floor is covered in fur.  \n\nHe constantly guilts me for not allowing the dog in my recording studio but I just want one place, particularly the place full of small electronics and cables, that is not full of fur and dog stank.\n\nAnyways, not trying to hijack the thread, maybe I should start my own and ask everyone \"is this marriage doomed to fail\"?  but the point is, from my point of view - I would be absolutely fine and adjusted to the dog if my partner was a devoted and attentive owner in terms of cleanliness.  But he's not.  He maintains that eventually \"the poop will just dissolve into the ground\" (Sure it will, but do I have to walk around in gross dog shit for six months until it does?) and isn't bothered by what he admits is the dog's \"stink\".  \n\nSo I feel like the more important issue could be whether you guys are on the same page as to cleanliness and general life habits.  If I had a partner more OCD and he was always vacuuming, picking up the dog poop, and, oh, actually making arrangements in advance to have the dog taken care of when we're going away (instead of ME always having to pick up the slack at the last minute).... I really wouldn't be bothered by it.  Instead, I have a lovable, sweet, stench-emanating creature who shits and sheds everywhere, that I never would have gotten of my own accord.  I would pet him more, if he didn't smell so bad.",
            "Kids, pets, and religion. These are the 'big 3' of dealbreakers in relationships.\n\nIt is totally okay for you to want pets. It is totally okay for her to not want pets. Unfortunately, it is very hard to find a compromise on pets, as you either have them or you don't.\n\nYou'll need to decide which is more important to you, because it sounds like you are going to have to choose between one or the other.",
            "Awe man. I'm sorry this just sucks. Ultimatums are usually not good, but you go get yourself your dog my friend. Screw her , she lied to you for years - to me this is on par if you wanted kids and she lied about it for years that she did too. People may think they are not the same thing , but I am never having kids ,but I absolutely want at least two dogs- its a big commitment and responsibility. I wouldn't be with someone who didn't want dogs, much like two people who have different stances on children . To me this is a deal breaker and j think you should go get your pup and you'll find someone who loves dogs too- like in 101 Dalmatians. All the best. ",
            "I want dogs someday and there's no way I'd let anyone come in the way of that. I had two dogs at home when I was young and can't think about never having a dog again. The best part about dogs is how happy they are to see you. When I moved away I would come home every one or two years. It's cheesy but the best part was knowing how happy my dog would be. I remember going home once and seeing him come running toward me (he was a dachshund) so I layed on the ground and let him smash his neck onto my face and wiggle around. That's how he hugged. \n\nIf your fiance can't get into that then it sucks but it's just something not for her and probably never will be. I'd be afraid of her possibly hurting the dog if you ended up getting one. People that don't like dogs will have short tempers with them.\n\n",
            "You have so completely fetishized owning a dog that I honestly think you turned a blind eye to Ali's obvious unwillingness to have one while thinking she'll get over it.",
            "If you can, explain to her that she misled you and kind of put you in a bad position. Tell her you will take care of all the responsibilities of owning a dog. However if she hates dogs that much and wouldn't be able to fathom being around it or god forbid became abusive towards it you may want to reconsider. ",
            "I got married to someone who told me he also didn't want kids. I was up front about it from the beginning of our relationship. Then after being married a few years he said he had always wanted kids and assumed that my clock would start ticking and I would change my mind. Now we are divorced. ",
            "Its a really bad relationship strategy to give ultimatums about things that are very important or integral to a persons happiness.\n\nYour gf, probably doesnt really understand that there is a real risk of alienating you so much with her ultimatum that you might infact break up with her. Not so much chose the dog over her, but realise she isnt a compatible partner, both because of the adversity to dogs, but more because of the ultimatum and lack of compromise. \n\nI think you should make it clear to her that you are actually considering that the two of you may not be compatible at all, and that you are very unhappy about her communication skills, and complete lack of regard for something you have repeadedly verbalised was important to you. - From decieving you into thinking she would be open to adopt a dog, to straight up ultimatum is such a huge landscape where constructive communication could have occurred. But didnt.\n\nIts not a healthy way to build relationship strategy or a good precedence for future conflict solving. That means, if you do break up with her, dont let her have the delusion that its because of the specifics of the dog. ",
            "I have family that don't care for pets. Thankfully they don't have any.  Animals just don't matter to them and they would likely, not through any real maliciousness on their part, more forgetfulness; neglect a pet. \n\nThat is why I wouldn't force pet ownership on anyone. I just spent $400 in vet bills alone on my dog last month, but I love my dog so it was worth it to me. If my husband didn't care for the dog it would cause a lot of strain on our relationship because medical problems do pop up from time to time. If she is as adamant about not wanting pets as you about are wanting pets, then there might be no compromise possible.\n\n\n\n",
            "Late to the party here, but:\n\nIts possible that this is difference in the way that dog lovers and dog indifferent folk look at pet discussions.\n\nTo me, it looks possible that OP's partner didn't understand the weight of what it meant to OP when he said he wanted a dog.  To a dog lover - and there a plenty on this thread - this can be as big a deal as the 'having kids' conversation.  Its a defining milestone in the future, and a part of what you are.\n\nIf you're not a dog person, though, it simply might not register as that definitive.  You might hear it in the same manner as hearing a partner say that they want to run a bar, or visit India.  Something they talk about, sure, but its not necessarily final, or a core ambition.\n\nRemember that they have spent their entire relationships without a dog - this is how OP's partner has experienced the two of them so far.  The absence of a dog so keenly felt by OP is the relationship status quo for her.\n\nWe don't know how their conversations went.  Its possible that OP thought he was making a clear and definite ambition known, but it just didn't register as such for OP's partner.\n\nIts definitely important enough to both of them that the relationship is at stake now.  But I think to say that OP's partner lied is way too strong.\n\nOP, get a dog.  Or don't.  Only you know if the relationship is worth it.  But if you might be about to break up over this, take some time to talk through a dog-owner's life with your partner, who might not have seen this the way you do.  After all, what would you have to lose?",
            "It's kind of unbelievable that you're thinking of ending a relationship over a dog that doesn't even exist. I mean, do you love this dog that you haven't even met yet THAT much more than this woman? The fact that you're even considering this leads me to believe that maybe your relationship has some much larger underlying issues and you're just using this fictional dog as an excuse to get out. I mean, in a healthy relationship, you both would just find a way to compromise.  Maybe you could volunteer at a dog shelter?",
            "If you're considering breaking up over this, you should not move forward with your engagement. She reacted badly, with a panicked attempt at manipulation. But you're taking that on it's face, when it sounds to me like she's worried. Rather than playing into it, this is a chance for you to both communicate better. If the relationship really is good, be the more mature communicator and reassure her: \"I care about you more than the hypothetical dog. But we need to compromise on this issue \u2014 I want a dog in my life.\"\n\nSeeing it from her perspective, it basically seems like you're going from 0 to 60. You've both never owned a dog, for your own reasons, but you personally have always dreamed of fulfilling that childhood fantasy of dog ownership. Well, first of all, you will not get that fantasy experience, because you will ultimately be responsible for all of the not-great aspects of pet ownership, while as a kid there's always a safety net there. \n\nAnd second of all, have you worked up to this in any way? Have you pet-sat your friends' dogs? Stayed over with someone who has dogs for a few weeks? Volunteered at the shelter you're hoping to adopt from? Thought about fostering a dog first, to get the hang of caring for one day in and day out? Have you even had a conversation about size, breed, age, or any of the other details before simply saying: \"I'm so excited that I can now go adopt a dog!\" \n\nIf you've done some of these things or something comparable, you're right, she lied to you, because those seem like firm steps towards dog ownership. But remember, she gave you a hesitant \"maybe\" about \"the RIGHT dog\" YEARS AGO. It sounds like you haven't taken the time to find out what that would be for her, and she, a person who still generally doesn't like dogs, feels that you're pushing her out of this relationship to make room for one rather abruptly. \n\nYou also don't mention any of the reasons why she doesn't like dogs or isn't excited about potential dog ownership. Too loud? Messy? Worried about allergies? She just wants to relax after getting home from work? Scared of them? Had plans to have a summer house in France? It's possible she just has a general antipathy for dogs, but if you've never even bothered to ask any details about why, you're just as bad as she is for doing the exact same thing to you (never probing to see what you were thinking about when/how you wanted to get a dog). \n\nI see a lot of people comparing this to having children, but that seems unfair to me. Unless one person already has children going into the relationship, any new parents will be experiencing it for the first time, and since we were all once kids, it's hard to imagine anyone who simply doesn't have ANY knowledge about what they're generally like. I think it's more like... owning a boat. If early into a relationship, someone wistfully told me: \"I'd love to own a boat one day,\" but never had any experience sailing or even spends time on boats, I'd be really surprised if after four years all of a sudden they told me they wanted to use our shared resourced to buy a boat that summer! It can mean a million different things and very different levels of commitment (is it a yacht, canoe, kayak, fishing boat, tugboat?), and someone can not like them for a million reasons, ranging from inexperience to being a jerk to PTSD and trauma. \n\nIf you care enough about this relationship to even think about getting married, try more communication and at least get to the bottom of what you're both thinking. It's possible that you're racing into this too fast and it's possible that her reaction is selfish and insecure rather than a long-term lie. Both can be worked through. ",
            "I really don't like living in a house with animals. I don't like how worked up everyone gets over them and how they're constantly a topic of conversation, I don't like the hustle when you're trying to make food in the kitchen, and I don't like never getting to make last-minute plans because the dog needs to be cared for. One of my biggest fears is falling in love with a dog person.\n\nA few years ago I fell in love with a woman with a dog, and tried it out because he was very well-trained. I still was constantly anxious and on-edge every time we were in the same room. It eventually lead to our breakup. \n\nNot all people dislike dogs just because they personally don't want to deal with the upkeep -- it may be deeper-seated issues about how she wants the energy of the home to feel.\n\nTalk to her openly about what the core of her issues are. Some may be compromisable, but others might not be. That will determine if you need to leave or not. ",
            "My boyfriend is \"eh\" about pets. I want a furry zoo.\n\nOur compromise is that I'm the primary caregiver for the pets. If he needs to he'll help me with some things, but I'm the one that feeds them, cleans up most of their messes, and so on. And it would absolutely be a deal breaker if he told me I couldn't be with him and get a pet I really wanted.\n\nShe intentionally lied to you about something she knew was important to you. She shouldn't be allowed to lie to get you where she wants you, then reveal the truth when she thinks it's too late in the game for you to leave her.\n\nDogs are wonderful pets. I've never met a truly bad dog. But do you really want a fianc\u00e9e that lies so you do what she wants?",
            "It's basically like compromising on having a kid... only with a shorter lifespan, and you can get rid of pets easier than children. People who have children they don't want end up resenting their child and their partner, and the relationship can fall apart quite easily. Same deal with pets. \n\nBut she's put you in a tough spot by lying to you all this time, and as someone who is buying a house with the intent of getting a puppy, I really feel for you. It was not fair to you that she played along in the hopes that you'd just forget about it.\n\nI don't think you're being petty or foolish for considering breaking up with her over this because you told her all along that getting a dog was important to you. If this is the thing that is a dealbreaker for you, then it's important enough to break up over. ",
            "Honestly, OP, it saddens me to hear that you two could end an otherwise-successful relationship over this disagreement, but I am kind of on your side. Pets are very rewarding for those of us who love animals. My mom is an animal lover and my father kind of despises them (oddly enough, he loved our first dog before my sister was born, but you can see him turn cold to the dog as soon as she's around in old videos). My dad *has* learned to live with pets because they make the rest of us happy, but my parents have the same exact fight when they get a new pet.\n\nOne *potential* short-term compromise could be to foster dogs. Let her know that you have always wanted a dog and you want one now, but you don't want to lose her. Ask her if she'd be open to a kind of temporary pet to see if dogs would grow on her at all. The other compromise would be a different kind of animal. None are quite like dogs, but lots of different pets can also be rewarding.",
            "Whoa whoa this is a shitty way of communicating. If this post is indicative of how you speak about your dream of having a dog it's obvious that this is both important and thought out on your end. What if this was kids instead? Or a future dream career that involves travel? Would she have also put it off until she was cornered and you looked like the bad guy if she disagreed with those goals? \n\nI recommend serious reconsidering on your part if this relationship is healthy for you.",
            "*\"You can be with me but only if you give up your lifelong dreams.\"*\n\nWhat happened to supporting your partner so they can reach their dreams?\n\nYou should be concerned about the fact that she trivialized your hopes and dreams to the point where she was banking on you just about forgetting them, and then using your relationship as leverage to get her way. ie: blackmail\n\nThe thing about blackmail is that when you leverage something that remains as leverage after the fact, it can be used over and over, which is a pretty damned unethical and a terribly unhealthy presence to have in your relationship.\n\nIf it was a deal-breaker for her, she should have mentioned it long ago. What she did was a dirty trick, and unless the situation can be salvaged, getting her way will leave a dark stain on your relationship for a long time to come. You've nurtured the commitment to own a dog since how old? And she wants you to drop it, not because dropping it will add something to the relationship or remove something bad, but just so you can maintain the relationship? Talk about a horrible tradeoff.\n\nSpeaking of talking, this is a good opportunity to discuss how good communication keeps relationships healthy, and conversely, how bad communication can destroy it.",
            "I can see where you are coming from but at the same time are you seeing where she is coming from? You are talking about how you always wanted a dog and when you have the ability to get a dog YOU WILL GET ONE. seems like regardless of the other person's feelings about it. it's kind of like without her input of if you should both get a dog it was more of a when YOU get a dog she can come help you pick it out. if you are in a long term relationship you should also take her feelings into account and learn a bit more as to why she doesn't want a dog and explain to her why you really want one.\n\nalso if you are really interested in getting a dog, see if she would be interested in at the very least pet sitting a friends dog with you for maybe a week.

            "I am a huge dog person. Like you, I always hounded my parents for a dog growing up but we lived in apartments. And if someone did to me what she did to you, I would 100% choose the dog. \n\nI understand that you have a relationship and have been together for four years, but she has known the WHOLE TIME that she would never want a dog. She basically led you on the whole time. Instead of thinking to herself, \"hey, I like this guy, but clearly dogs are important to him, and I hate dogs, maybe we shouldn't be together,\" and then doing just that, she lied to you in the hopes that one day your love for her would beat out your lifelong desire to have a dog.

            "There should be a way to compromise on this, but doesn't seem like she wants to. My boyfriend loves dogs and similarly mentioned wanting to get a dog pretty early in our relationship. I've always been afraid of dogs and never had a pet, but knew my fear was pretty irrational and that it'd make my boyfriend really happy. We got a dog this past spring. I'm still getting used to him, but I've grown to love the dog even though he has too much energy sometimes. I feel like she should be willing to try if she has no reason for her \"no\" other than not liking them. Has she ever had one?",
            "Yeah, wow, sorry that she put you in this situation. This wouldn't be choosing a dog over your fiancee. This is not \"her or the dog\".  This would be choosing to not be in a relationship with a person who's communication skills are so stunted that they intentionally mislead you for years and then give you an ultimatum regarding something they've known you always wanted. Poor communication skills, deception and lack of trust are perfectly valid reasons to not want to be in a relationship with someone. ",
            "It's really not fair of her to blindside you with an ultimatum, and I'm sure she knows that. Think about it this way (and maybe ask your fiancee to think about it this way too): Will you be happy if you never, ever get to own a dog your entire life? If you want children, will you be happy creating the same rule for them that your mom had for you? If a dog is essential to your happiness, and not having a dog is essential to hers, you're probably not compatible. It sucks, but there it is, and she should have been honest about that from the beginning instead of hoping you'd just sort of forget your lifelong dream of dog ownership *even as you picked out a place to live together in part because it would be suitable for a dog*. (The way she went about this was not great, to say the least.)\n\nI've seen animal-lover/animal-disliker relationships where person A would get a pet and person B would make them give away their pets after x time had passed, or where the animal-disliker ended up resenting the animals themselves, or where the animal-lover ended up being hurt by their pet being a constant source of tension. If you can't quite see eye-to-eye on animals, you have to at least be willing to figure out what you both can live with for the rest of your lives. At the very least, she needs to back down from the ultimatum and be willing to discuss. If she can't have an animal around, any animal, ever, you have to decide if that can be the rest of your life. If it can't, you need to make it clear that you don't think you can be happy never having any pets. And if you do arrive at a compromise OR give up on dogs OR she agrees to let you have one, then you still need some serious discussions about being honest with each other. As someone who needs animals to be happy and knows that, I would be feeling very hurt and betrayed right now. And I'd choose the dog, but that's me.",

Long story short, he and Oliver bonded while I was in the hospital and also from the fact that he did all of the walks for the first nine months or so. Oliver is his dog. He adores him. If anything is remotely wrong with him, my husband has him booked into the vet to check it out. \n\nIt's really unfortunate she lied and that she's not willing to give a dog a chance. \n\nBy the way, I think it's great you're looking at getting a shelter pet. Both of ours are from the Humane Society and we love the heck out of them. \n\nGood luck, whatever happens. I just hope you wind up with a dog. ",
            "If she's open to compromising then definitely make it clear you'll do all the work. If she's worried about mess try getting a dog that doesn't shed? Would you have broken up if she had told you at the beginning that dogs were a hard no?",
            "I think should have a final talk with her, telling her that you care about her thats why is important that she agree with having  the dog and answer any question why is the problem with the dogs. if say no without, you luck with the next one. \n\nYou can find someone like her who likes dogs and  can be more trustful more. ",
            "I am not a dog/cat person - at all.  It's a huge deal breaker for me.  And Ali fucked up by saying she'd be ok with it if she wasn't.  So, is there any middle ground?  Maybe.  Is there a breed that won't shed hair (which is one of my *no way* things and might be one of hers?).  Will you absolutely look after your dog and make sure it is trained well and she won't have to deal with it a) slobbering all over her, b) having to take it out and pick up it's shit, c) be forced or guilted into 'loving' it?\n\nLike I say - not everyone is a pet person, and if your girlfriend isn't but she's doing her best then that should be enough and tread lightly - it might take a long time for her to curl up on the couch with your dog (the very idea makes me dry puke) - but she's making an effort.",
            "My fianc\u00e9 and I made a compromise about this. She is a HUGE dog lover and has two. They take up the bed and I'm a light sleeper. If it were up to me, I'd rather them sleep out in the living room with comfy beds or on the couch with blankets, etc. so I said, I love this woman and my sleep too. So I have my own room for sleep. If the dogs bark, she handles it. She's happy and I'm happy because we agreed to compromise. I've grown to love her dogs and find myself spoiling them a little too much. :)\n\nI say you get your dream pup and let your fianc\u00e9 get used to the pup. Talk about compromise. It's your life too and you seem like you'd make a great pooch owner. Way too many homeless animals out there.",
            "It sounds like she is being childish. Firstly, this is her fault. Second, she is literally saying rather than take responsibility for her mistake she would rather leave you.\n\nHer not having a dog seems to be more important to her than you. That type of personality and lack of responsibility is a bad combo my friend. Now that you're making good money you'd had better protect it by not marrying her. (Of course all I know about her is what you wrote, but its not looking good) Seems like the type of person that would take everything you got if you divorced.",
            "Try fostering a dog! Tell her you'll take all the responsibilities of that dog and if you didn't stand up to your word you don't get to keep the dog, but most probably you will and you'll j get to adopt the dog and keep him forever and during that fostering time she'll probably grow to love him so she'll change her mind! \n\nIf she doesn't agree to the fostering idea, drop her lol. ",
            "My question is....why is it up to her? Why does she get to say no when you say yes...why is she the final answer?  Marriage is all about give and take...all about compromise. If it is your dream to own a dog and you have had this dream since forever, then she should be willing to try. Maybe she does not have to take the dog out? Or she doesn't have to clean up after it....anything. I just don't understand why she wants to crush your dreams on something that is so loving.  Good luck to you, I hope it works out.",

Quite frankly, if it was me personally, I would leave. \n\nI love animals too and if my boyfriend had lied about this at the beginning of the relationship and only admitted to me 4 years down the line he didn't want any, It would be justifiable for me to leave him.

            "If she's completely unwilling to get a dog then I would break up with her. She essentially lied to your face about her willingness to get a dog. It sounds like you made it clear you were very passionate about getting a dog and you trusted her when she said she would eventually be willing. I think this is a huge betrayal on her part and just shows shes not able to communicate properly.\n\nMy bf loves dogs and has always wanted one. I held him off because I still wasn't sure I wanted one and it was never the right time for several different reasons. When we were finally in a place we could get a dog we had a long talk. We agreed that it would be a small dog (I've always been scared of big dogs), we both would have to agree on which dog to get and he would take on the bulk of the responsibilities. I completely fell in love with our dog after we rescued him, and it's actually me who take the most care of him. I honeslt couldn't imagine our life without him. I think the difference between me and your current gf is I MEANT it when I told him I was open to a dog when we're ready. ",
            "Speaking for myself, I would never marry someone who would not let me have pets. My poor husband has so many cats and parrots and a dog to deal with, but our home is full of life and love. Before I owned a house, I kept rats as they are such a great apartment pet and fun, endearing little animals.\n\nOP, if you marry this woman and it lasts, you'll have gone your whole life without ever owning a pet. First your mom, now your fiancee. This seems heart-breaking and really wrong to me. Wanting a dog is such a modest dream. \n\nI'd feel differently about this if your fiancee had always been honest about her feelings or if they came from some kind of severe allergy or past trauma, like PTSD from a severe dog bite. But she just doesn't like dogs, and she was dishonest. \n\nEven if we leave the issue of the dog out, (1) she lied to you about something important to you to get you under false pretenses into a committed relationship with her and (2) she is unwilling to compromise on something important to you. Is this the behavior of someone you want to marry? When there is a conflict, she will lie and refuse to compromise and basically steamroller over you. Please don't accept that.  Billions of women in the world; you can find one who loves dogs. \n",
            "I don't think she's being reasonable. I love dogs, but I don't like them inside of the house. Maybe this might be an issue? I can't see the problem with you having an outside dog if you take care of it. Just a different perspective. ",
            "I think the question you've got to ask here is would I be unhappier without my future dog or without this woman as my future wife. :/ it sucks that she wasn't absolutely honest about not ever wanting a pup in the first place but now that she's made herself perfectly clear the ball is in your court. It's a shitty decision but you shouldn't feel guilty about it either way. If you c any imagine the rest of your life without ever owning a dog or other pet then you may have to sacrifice the relationship, if you can't imagine your life without her you'll probably end up having to sacrifice having the pup unless there's some sort of compromise you both can come to. Def try to open it up to discussion one more time and emphasize the importance of you wanting a dog to be apart of your life too. ",

However, I think SHE's the one who is willing to throw it all away, since she gave the ultimatum. An ultimatum that is based, may I add, to a preference that OP stated early on and kept on actively talking about. She sounds like the rest of her life will have to be her way.\nJust go get a dog, dude. You're young and quite honestly, she sounds like the wooooooorst.",

            "I'm no therapist or relationship guru so - take this all with a grain of salt.\n\nThat being said, if I were you I would turn the tables back around on her and leave her with the ultimatum. Something to the effect of, \"As we've discussed on *multiple* occasions over the past four years, I am going to be getting a dog. If this is a deal breaker for you there's nothing I can do about that, but I wish you would have told me earlier *when we were making the plans to get a dog when XYZ conditions were met*.\"\n\nPut the \"ultimatum\" and life-shaking decision back on her. You did nothing wrong in regards to this - you've done your homework, you waited until the time was right, you discussed it with her on multiple occasions so this wasn't a surprise to her. She's the one that has upended your mutual agreement on a life \"plan\" (if you will) and she should be the one that's left to make the decision about whether or not her lying is going to cause this relationship to end (as far as the dog is concerned - please listen to other redditors though in regards to her inability to communicate and just lying in general, because *that* might be a deal-breaker for *you*, which is completely understandable and if not that then some heavy couple's counseling).\n\nThe biggest \"red flag\" for me though is the fact that she's decided that somehow, for some reason, you're the one that should have to change their plans. What? She's the one with the problem and she should be the one to find a solution to it. Plain and simple. There is no ultimatum for you, even if she's trying to pretend that there is. You two made a plan to get a dog, now you're going to get a dog. If this is now something that she wants to leave and end then relationship over there's nothing you can do to stop her. But please don't fall into the mentality that you've done something wrong or that you've caused a problem. You haven't.",

Maybe Ali will change her mind when she has some exposure to a real live animal in her home - maybe she'll even fall in love. If not, well, I guess Ali will leave you, but you'll have a nice furry buddy to lift your spirits while you look for a more honest, compatible life partner.",

I think a dog is more than a dog. A dog is a companion, therapeutic, something positive to add to your routine, a living being. If you adopt a dog, you're saving a life so there's that too. There is just an overwhelming amount of positivity that comes with owning a dog (or a cat! or other animals) that can't be substituted with anything else (besides children for some people). \n\nAnyway, her lack of communication about something as serious as this is giving you a glimpse into the future. If you decide to stay with her, you'll probably have a really hard time believing her over any other serious topics.

This is extremely shitty behaviour and cannot continue, because she can and will do it again about other issues.\n\nI guarantee you that she is bluffing. You need to say in no uncertain terms that she cannot veto your dreams like that, especially when you have been so upfront about them from the start.
