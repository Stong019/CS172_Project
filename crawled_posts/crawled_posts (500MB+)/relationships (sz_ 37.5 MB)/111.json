She went from being someone that I absolutely *hated* and could barely work with to just my least favorite person in the office, but no more than that.\n\nBut then today, I was informed by one of the other bosses that she no longer works for our firm! Apparently I wasn't just being over-sensitive or not meshing with her style as a boss, but  was correct in thinking that she was difficult to work with to the point of incompetence. \n\ntl;dr: I mostly figured out how to deal with the difficult coworker/boss, but then she got fired.",

It's no reason to hold against you in an isolated event.*\n\nAnd the reason I share that story with you isn't, obviously bc your situation's outcome was similar to mine, but bc I think it's helpful for you and any other reader to remember that not all managers deserve that role.

        "selftext": "My fiance and I have been together for almost five years now, and we have been engaged for close to 10 months. We've had an absolutely wonderful relationship, he's kind, sweet, hard-working, and extremely attractive. While we've had our ups and downs like every other couple, we've always been able to communicate very effectively and understand the others feelings in any sort of conflict. He's everything I want in a man and I love him dearly.\n\nAnyways, yesterday while he was out, I was transferring some photos from a recent vacation we had taken onto my laptop. Some of the photos were on his laptop, so I decided to go onto his laptop and quickly get the photos onto a USB to transfer onto mine. When I went on his laptop, I saw that he had FB open, and also noticed that he was messaging my sister. I found this kinda strange, I mean they're not really that close and don't talk to one another unless we're at a family event. \n\nSo I open up the message box, and it shows a lot of messages between the two. In them, it contains a ton of dirty texts, nudes, and messages to meet up. I was absolutely shocked when I saw this. It turns out whenever he tells me \"I'm going out with the boys\", he's really been fucking my sister. He hadn't shown any signs of being unhappy or cheating, I mean we're getting married in two months for gods sakes! And my sister, our entire lives we've been so close to one another. She's the one who I rant to, spill all my secrets, get advice and support from, she even helped my fiancee propose to me! I just can't believe they would do this to me.\n\nI'm sorry if this post is all over the place, I've consumed more alcohol in the past 24 hours than in the past 6 months. I was sure we were going to spend the rest of our lives together, and then this happens. He's been at his mother's house for the past few days visiting, and on the 23rd were heading back to my family's house for Christmas. I have absolutely no clue as to how to deal with this, how do I even act around my sister and fiancee knowing they've been having an affair? I'm devastated that the two people closest to me could betray me so deeply... I just don't understand. Please please please help me.\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for all your advice and support! I appreciate all your kind words during this difficult time. Some people have requested an update, I'll try to provide one perhaps a couple days after Christmas\n\n\n**tl;dr**: Sister and fiance have been sleeping together, please help me.",

            ">on the 23rd were heading back to my family's house for Christmas\n\nHere is the best advice I can give you. Don't do this. At least not if you are trying to pretend like everything is okay. You are in trauma and processing a lot of things. There is going to be shame and embarrassment.\n\nStep 1: take screenshots of everything between them. If you tell them, they might try to deny it, erase the evidence and call you crazy.\n\nStep 2: take back your holiday. Seriously, fuck trying to keep the peace. Tell your parents that your sister is fucking your fiance and that you will not spend Christmas with either of them. Offer screenshot proof. Make alternate plans for christmas at a friend's house.\n\nHold a boundary that you will not be around either of them. You will be 10 x more miserable if you try to hold out and have this fight after Christmas. You didn't ruin the holidays, they did.",
            "To start with if this is 100% what is happening. End it. That level of deceit, dishonesty and disregard for your feelings is not acceptable in any way no matter the time together.    \n    \nSecondly, start thinking practically. Screenshots, take them and save them to a flash drive. Images, messages, all of it. It will be hart to look at but do it. You need proof, you may not think it but you will. Financially. This is hard I know. Chanel that hurt your feeling and make it cold as ice. I assume you\u2019re living together and share some items. What you need to do around those needs to be decided and doing so in advance will save issues later down the line.    \n    \nThird, make a decision. Can you handle that at your family home for x-mas?\n",
            "First of all, I am so sorry this has happened to you. What your fiance and sister have done is inexcusable, hurtful and morally repugnant. I know this pain is intense, but thank your lucky stars that you have discovered the truth. No longer do you have to waste anymore time (and a marriage no less) on your soon-to-be ex nor do you have to nurture a relationship with a spiteful sibling. You're about to lose some dead weight; you are about to cut out two very hurtful and deceitful people from your life. \n\nIn regards to your relationship, you know what you need to do. You must end it. Someone who would lie and cheat on you has no love or respect for you. This creep not only cheated, but also embarked on this ugly escapade with someone he knew you were close to: your sister. He chose to hurt you, play you and then pursue a future with you all while screwing around with your sibling. This is unforgivable behavior and reveals how completely selfish and manipulative your fiance is. Cut off this engagement as soon as possible then completely block this guy from all your social media. He isn't the loving caring man you thought he was. He is a liar; he is jerk. \n\nBefore you break up with this man, take the other advice given here and gather evidence. Get a thumb drive and transfer all screen shots of dirty pictures, facebook messages and any videos onto it. Yes, it will suck beyond belief to go through these images, but it will benefit you in the long run. It provides you with proof against the fiance and sister when they try to make excuses for their behavior, or straight up lie to you about it. Also, as awful as this sounds, if mom and dad don't believe you, well, you'll have the evidence of the affair to share with them. (Hopefully, it will not come to that). \n\nI also advise you to split up any joint bank accounts. Move all your assets into a private account that only you can touch. If you're sharing an apartment (which it sounds like you are) talk to your landlord about the lease agreement. I'd honestly move out in your shoes. I wouldn't want to stay anywhere near my cheating ex. If the majority of the lease is paid by you or in your name, then the ex fiance can go. This is really your call here. Either kick him out or relocate. Legal advice reddit will have more knowledge on this front. \n\nIn terms of Christmas, I would not be heading home to spend it with your sister. Once you have all your evidence, I think you should call or Skype your parents. Tell them everything. Let them know that you will not be doing anything with your sister for the foreseeable future. That what your sister has done has hurt you in an unimaginable way, and that it is your sister's responsibility to mend her relationship with you not yours. I'd even go as far as to say this, \"Mom and Dad, I would still love to spend Christmas with you guys, but if sister is going to be there then I will not be going. I am not emotionally ready to deal with her deception or the pain she has caused right now. I also don't know when I will be in a place where I'll want anything to do with her either. I hope you both can understand and respect that.\" \n\nIf your parents try to say, \"No, sister would never do that\" then provide them with evidence. Don't allow yourself to be guilted into forgiving your sister or to attend a holiday where her very presence will cause you more heartbreak. You need to put yourself first now. I'm hoping your parents will be sensible and compassionate towards your situation. If they end up defending your sister, you should cut ties with them for awhile as well. You don't need anymore stress, pain or ugliness in your life right now. What you do need is time to heal. \n\nLastly, confront both the fiance and sister with all the things you have found. (Perhaps do this with a trusted friend or two around that will offer you support). Tell them you're through with both of them. If your sister begins to cry, let her. Remind her that she threw away her relationship with you to cheat with your fiance. She helped cause this rift and you, frankly, cannot trust her anymore. Also remind her that this isn't something sisters do to each other (let alone friends) and that you are going no contact for awhile. \n\nAs for the fiance, tell him you are done. Tell him you are either moving out or he is (this depends on the lease agreement and what you decide in regards to that). Then you know what you should do? Give him the engagement ring. Tell him marriage and love are things you find sacred, and you will not spend your life shackled to a liar that transformed those delicate sentiments into a mockery. You deserve better than him. After this, you can either leave with your things all packed or kick your sister and ex out of your apartment. Make sure if you keep said apartment that you also change the locks. You don't want either of them having a key either. \n\nWhen the dust settles, remind yourself you did nothing wrong. You were betrayed and cruelly so. Take all the time you need to heal. Travel. Pursue new hobbies. Hang out with friends. Make new friends. Maybe even consider some therapy too because what you've experienced would shake anyone up. You'll get through this OP. I know you will. Take care, okay? And know that real love is waiting. Good luck.  ",

Put your phone somewhere and forget it's there until you sober up.  Because yep, if anybody needs to dull the pain for a few hours right now, it's you.  But I would so hate for you to lose out on some dignity by having any contact with either of them until you sober up.  \n\nI am so sorry that the life you have now is different from the one you had yesterday morning and hoped and planned for.  I wish you so much better luck in your next one.  ",

You do no stand such nonsense.\n\nI know it hurts, but that will happen next month after you call them out.\n\nInexcusable.",
            "If I were in your situation, I would ghost the pair of them.  There is really nothing they could possibly say or do that would fix this - do you really want to marry somebody who poisoned your relationship with not only them, but also with your sister?  \n\nIf you want to ghost them:\nTake screenshots of these communications and back them up somewhere safe.  Grab any sentimental items and your important documents (passport, birth certificate, etc) and leave them with a trusted friend or family member.  \n\nCancel your wedding, you may be able to get some money back now.  Write a letter to all the attendees.  Keep it brief.  Get a trusted friend to vet the letter before you send it out to everyone including your respective families.  If anyone not close to you asks for details, tell them that it's painful and personal and you don't want to get upset all over again.  \n\nCall your parents and let them know what has happened and that you can't see your ex or your sister right now.  Email your now ex-fiance and sister the evidence, perhaps post a brief outline on social media as to what has happened (if you don't want to throw your sister under the bus for whatever reason, you can just say he's cheating) and vanish for a few days (go to a friends, parents, other relatives).  Allow the shitshow to unfold and be completely uncontactable - perhaps leave your phone with a friend to vet your calls and messages.\n\nThe hardest thing in all this may be winding up your lease.  If you talk to your landlord about the situation, he may be sympathetic and will let you out early, otherwise you may need to turn to any sympathetic friends or family members who can let you crash at theirs while you sort yourself out.\n\nWhatever you do, don't talk to them, or at least let them stew for a few days.\n\nSpend your Christmas building a new life without your ex or sister in it.  Join a pottery class.  Hit the gym.  Read some books.  It gets better, and really you're doing them a favour - you're too good for them, and they had to learn this the hard way.",

For the finale, toss the items of your fuck you folder into your mom and sister's lap, with exchanged nudes and dirty messages fully exposed for all to see. Make your fuck you exit. Block sister and ex-fiance from everything. Be happy to spite them, and despite them.

Do it early.\n\nAh shit, you know what? I suggest you get out of your apartment as soon as you can.

And your so strong for not just burning that bridge completely. Go you. I hope I could handle that as gracefully as you seem to be. Messed up. But, if not her it would've been some random chick anyways.  Cheaters cheat. You don't need to mend that relationship with her until you're ready and allow yourself that. It may take months, years even, just let it happen after you process this. But, at least you didn't marry that prick. \n\nAlso, public family shaming though secretly will feel amazing will probably not leave you in the best light. Handle this however you see fit and quite frankly they deserve it all, but nothing beats handling a situation with grace. I find the best revenge is being (outwardly) unaffected, they fucked up, they ruined the possibility of that future, they don't even deserve to have power over your emotions. Again, that's for show, by all means bathe in your wedding dress while eating ice cream but don't allow him anything else.

Maybe tag all his and your family and close friends. \n\nOf course this might actually be revenge fantasy, and you may not need to do all that....but you definitely need evidence and you definitely need to tell everyone right away, with the screenshots.\n\nWhether that is done publicly or semi privately is something you need to weigh in your mind, but don't wait too long. Your  family will be pissed...at them. Good. When you screw people over, others get angry. You get to be the bad guy. Perhaps in the future, don't screw people over and you won't have to deal with that. They apparently need to learn how to be decent human beings the hard way.",
            "This is bullshit. What an awful thing to happen to you and right before Christmas. I am angry and sad for you. I am so sorry. All of the other advice is great, but coming from someone who has had family issues, **YOU HAVE TO TELL YOUR PARENTS.** It is essential. My brother is my best friend (he is going to be the \"man  of honor\" at my wedding), and even if he did something this awful, I would have to out him. Please, please, please talk to your family about it and let them know the whole story. Not only will you suffer if you don't, but your family will even more so. Clear the air. Best of luck, and my heart truly goes out to you. ",

            "Taking a different tack:\n\nI wouldn't go to Christmas at your parents' either, but I would say it was because:\n\n* you need time to sort out how you want to move forward in (or away from) the relationship with your fiance\n* you don't want to figure out how you want to (if at all) have a relationship of any kind with your sister until you've got your head on straight about what's just happened + how you feel about your ~~asshole~~ fiance\n* AND you want to try and do these things without the added craziness of holiday travel, etc.\n\nDO offer proof or screenshots, not to be vindictive, but (and say this) so your parents know that their children are about to get into some serious shit.\n\nDO NOT ask them to take sides.  The two of you are of age, and need to handle this yourselves.  They are adults as well and will do what they need to.\n\nDO accept your parents and friends offers to talk if you can (phone, Skype, etc).  It's very easy to cut everyone off when you've been betrayed like this.  I speak from experience.\n\nDO remember that time is on your side.  Relationships built on illicit bullshit tend to implode, but the memory of betrayal lives forever.  You may one day forgive one or both of them, but you won't forget, especially if this is a long-term thing as you implied, rather than a drunken one-night fuckup.\n\nDON'T let yourself stay in the habit of drinking.  It's not a fix, and will slow you down (and make you do stupid things) when you need to think on your feet.\n\nDO remember that what you need is not revenge; it is to get back to living YOUR life, rather than it being centered around the injury someone else has inflicted on you.\n\nHang in there, and best wishes.  *hugs*\n\nEdited to add: \"Always tell the truth.

Get to a safe place you can stay for a few days. Have your friends keep you off social media for now (especially while drunk).  \n\nHow you want to tell people and spend your holidays is up to you. If it were me, once I got out of the apartment and had time to plan it, I would definitely tell my parents the whole truth so that they know what a piece of shit sister is and that you will not be in the same room as her for the foreseeable future.

If it's your money, I would tell mom that sister is going to need to make all the calls to vendors herself. Especially poetic justice if your sister was your MOH. Perhaps your mom and bridesmaids can supervise that process to make sure everything is handled. If your fiance's family was paying, then I would just say it's off, you people figure it out. \n\nYou have enough time that you can send formal cancellations to all guests, but I bet most people will hear the whole drama way before they receive your note. \n\nYou don't need to lower yourself by posting anything dramatic on Facebook.

For example tell your sister that you found out he's cheating on you with some other woman (who is not your sister) so that she'll be upset with him for cheating on HER with this new mystery woman. Or mess with HIM somehow by saying your sister has an std or is pregnant or something. Then let them freak out, get upset with each other, and then slowly figure out the truth ... that you know about them.\n\nI wouldn't REALLY do that, because I just don't have it in me, but I'd have fun daydreaming about revenge like that.\n\nGood luck.

            "I just want to jump in to say that I am extremely impressed with OP. In your first post, all of your actions are those of a person who is mature, sweet, and kind. I mean, at least attempting to clean up your bathroom mess at 2 am when you're feeling awful, bleeding, and 15? That's extremely considerate and the fact that you missed a few spots shouldn't be a big deal at all. Your stepmom and/or dad should have felt bad the next morning that you were up and feeling awful all by yourself.\n\nAnd bringing over enough food for your MEDICALLY-DIRECTED diet for not just you but them as well? That's SO sweet. And then Deb made you cook it by yourself, after she was done cooking her other food -- and then made you stop in the middle of cooking? That's horrible and, frankly, heartbreaking. \n\nI'm so glad that you have your mother. Does she seem to be supportive? It sounds like you felt extremely betrayed by Deb and hurt, and questioning if she ever actually has cared for/about you. That can really fuck with you. I can't say why she's being so mean (and why your dad is being such an absolute shit of a father right now), but I can tell you that it isn't your fault and says more about the kind of people they are than it does about you. \n\nI'd urge you to ask your mom about seeing a counselor or seeing if you can talk to your school's guidance counselor. You went through some really emotionally intense things. \n\nYou seem like an awesome person and, honestly, I think you have handled everything beautifully. You deserve the best.\n\n**edited to say that some sessions with a therapist AND your dad would probably be a great idea, if that's at all possible. It would be nice to salvage a relationship with him, and a therapist could help him figure out how to be the father you need. \n***Also, you're definitely doing the right thing by avoiding Deb. She is abusive and it will only get worse. Good for you!",

If I ate something at 9pm, I  had to wash and dry and put away. She would get a pass. I would be cooking and she would tell me she needed to start cooking NOW so whatever I was cooking had to be put away.  I had to ask her permission before I started cooking so I could avoid a meltdown. One year she wanted to cook everything for Thanksgiving. She hadn\u2019t started cooking by noon so I decided to chop vegetables for vegetable tray. She saw this and made me throw all the vegetables I cut  Into the trash. \n\nIf I bled in the bathroom and missed one drop she mostly likely would scream that I was gross and left the bathroom a disaster. \n\nShe moved out of state and I wanted to see her house. She told me I have too many kids and there\u2019s no room for us to visit. Her house is 2000 square feet, and we\u2019d only visit for maybe an hour,  I would  take her out to eat as a thank you. Nope. She\u2019s not up to it but told our other sister she has no warm feelings towards my kids because she doesn\u2019t even know them. Wonder why? \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s anxiety or what but good on you for distancing yourself from Deb. I\u2019m so sorry your dad doesn\u2019t put you first. ",

Your dad is taking the coward\u2019s way out.  \n\nMy dad did the same thing after my stepmom tried to kill me when I was your age. And, 15 years later, it still causes me a lot of emotional trauma because, well, your parents are supposed to protect you, and taking the side of the person that tried to kill you goes against a very baseline emotional need that everyone, especially kids, need from their parents. \n\nThe thing my mom would always say about it, that didn't fully help but kind of helps explain it a little better: she's the one he has to wake up next to every day. It's massively, massively cowardly, obviously. It\u2019s also totally possible that your dad is on the receiving end of an abusive relationship. Which, even if it\u2019s true, is an explanation for his behavior, not an excuse. Your dad still owes you more than that. Way, way more. \n\nYou come across like a really, really thoughtful, articulate and considerate person. That\u2019ll take you really far in life. Even so, if you can manage it, it might be super useful to get some therapy, even if it's just short term.

I suggested divorce because of that, because I thought her dad should choose her, and he didn't. I couldn't understand that and I lost respect for him as a result. We are now divorced, he is living with his much too young girlfriend who throws a tantrum if he puts the kids before her. She tattles on the kids if they don't basically worship her.

It's more likely that your step-mom wanted you out of the picture and was waiting for you to do something so she could create a fight and make your dad pick her. \n\nShitty for sure, but it's much more about her than about you.\n\nI hope you can move on and not let it get to you too much. Your dad may come around after he sees her true nature.",

            "I am so sorry OP. \nDeb doesn\u2019t sound like a very nice person. Perhaps you could tell your dad hat you love him and want a relationship with him, but Deb has been mean and disrespectful to you and you don\u2019t understand how he could choose her over his own child.  Suggest that when you get together you and him could go to the movies or out to eat, but until Deb apologists you\u2019d rather not be around her. Deb will either come around or not. I do think he will look back on this issue and see his mistake, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to realize your errors when you make them.  Stay strong. ",
            "I'm sorry that happened, but your dad has made his choice. And he's an idiot, but really at least he's keeping an abusive POS away from you and your mom has your back.\n\nSupport your mom, ask for therapy is you need it, realize that your father is an immature idiot and you need to keep him at arm's length until the day he finally grows up. If he ever does.\n\nI'm sorry, but relatives are who you are born with, family is who has your back and that's your mom, not your dad. ",
            "I just read your original post and now this one. All I can is I'm so sorry. Deb is completely out of line and I'm sorry that your dad isn't strong enough on his own to stand up to her and help show you what you're worth to him. Your his daughter! I have a beautiful 7 year old stepson and I can't imagine ever treating him this way. If he made a mess because he was sick and needed help cleaning up, I would be right in there doing it like I would with any of my other kids. What she has done could have created a deep sense of shame within yourself and her attitude is entirely uncalled for. So sorry OP, I hope your dad comes to his senses and you can't tell me he doesn't feel off about this too. He knows what happened, he's just not strong enough to face it unfortunately. ",

            "fuck your dad. you are right, and so is your mom goddamnit. I am sorry your dad is effectively chasing some chick over you. That is not okay. You are a great kid and do not deserve that treatment. Thank god you have your mom to step up to the plate. You got us (or at least me) if you ever need an ear, and you have your mom. \n\nUntil your dad understands that first you are his kid, over his side piece, you are SO much better off. ",
            "My parents are divorced, and a similar thing happened to me when they split up. \n\nWithout going into much detail the event corrected itself as I hope you dad will see the errors in his ways and pursue having a relationship with you. Divorces are really messy but as a child of divorce it's not your fault. Think positive! ",
            "I am so, so sorry that you are going through this. It reminds me a lot of my stepmother and my dad when I was around the same age as you. Your dad has made the wrong choice, YOU should be the one in the 'package deal' with him, not her. I hope he realises his mistake, but I'm glad you've got your mum supporting you.",
            "Whoa. Screw your dad and deb. \n\nYou\u2019re not an adult. If you have tummy/bowel issues especially if they are chronic your parents should be doing everything they can to assist your diet. I believe that you made an effort to clean and if you didn\u2019t catch every bit, it\u2019s ok! It\u2019s totally wrong and fucked up that you were shamed in any way!!!!! Totally wrong.  \n\nThat kind of stress exacerbates that condition. Good on you for trying to hone in your diet and shame on your dad for not helping you. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry that your dad isn\u2019t siding with you. ",

            "Sweetheart your dad is an asshole. Deb\u2019s behaviour was disgusting. You had an accident there was no need to act as she did and the kitchen behaviour was terrible. My daughter has a step mum who\u2019s never treated her like that nor would her Dad allow it. Your dad will regret siding with her one day. ",
            "Hey. I\u2019m sorry this shit is happening to you. I read your original post too.  You\u2019re 16, a young woman but still a kid. A divorce is hard enough, but it seems like you were accepting of the situation but Deb just went psycho over two incidents? 1) the \u201cmess\u201d you made Bc you didn\u2019t realize you had a medical condition and 2)over using the kitchen together?\n\nIn both instances, I don\u2019t like her reaction. She was perhaps frustrated, but could have said so in a different manner.  Have you - yes, the younger person here - tried to explain that perspective e to her? If yes, what was her reaction?\n\nNow To turn to the latest happening. Your dad won\u2019t see you Bc he and Deb are a package deal... wow. So not appropriate to say to your own kid. Sorry if I missed this, but did really try to explain to him something along the lines of \u201clisten...that\u2019s some messed up shit she did and said, and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready to see her. But you\u2019re my dad. I still want to see you\u201d. Well if you have...I, sorry kid. You\u2019re young. You\u2019re still growing and wising up...and you have a choice. Dont let someone else\u2019s shitty decision become toxic to your soul. Think of it this way: fine dad. If that\u2019s your decision, then I can\u2019t see you.  He gave you a shitty ultimatum. It\u2019s time for you to stand up and do what feels right for you rather than give into a shitty deal that should never have been placed on your shoulders. Does it suck? Hell yeah. But that\u2019s shitty and it\u2019s time for you to move on from that place right now. \n\nMaybe time will tell whether he realizes he made a dumb fuck decision and put that on his daughter. Maybe he\u2019ll realize that this Deb is a little messed up. If/when that happens he may come crawling back to ask for your forgiveness. Whether you\u2019re ready to forgive, who knows. I have no idea how to forgive, but I know absolutely toxic people. Don\u2019t be around them for too long. You dealt with it. You learned from it. And by the looks of it, you knew Bc you would not have actively avoided Deb and told your father as such. \n\nNo matter what. Do NOT let this determine how you grow up and how you fall in love. You are better than these people and their experience. Don\u2019t become a person who blames all their failed relationships on her parents or dad. I know this much isn\u2019t advice you were looking for, but I\u2019m gonna give it. You have the opportunity here to be wiser. Take care kiddo. ",
            "Man that sucks. My dad chose his (now ex) wife over my sisters, and mostly me. I was the youngest so I couldn't move out like they did, but my step mother treated me like crap and he let her do it.\n\nIt's hard, I'm not going to lie. For various reasons I didn't go NC with him even after I did move out, but you might find that to be the easiest way to handle this until he comes around. At some point (hopefully) he's going to realize he made a huge mistake and may try to reconnect. You can either let him or not -- your choice.\n\n Hang in there, and please consider counseling. Fear of abandonment can be very detrimental to your future relationships, and the last thing you want is to allow your dad's shitty move to effect your life that way well into the future. ",
            "been there, OP. Sorry. Only thing to do is lower your expectations of your Dad to zero. Because he's decided to  disappoint you. Not your fault.",
            "I\u2019m really sorry this is happening. What your dad and Deb are doing is disgusting. The same kind of thing happened when my dad remarried when I was a kid. My step mom saw my brother and me as \u201ccompetition\u201d for dad\u2019s affection. Maybe Deb has the same skewed perception? My bet is that your dad is going to realize down the road what an awful mistake he made. At least I hope he will. Props to your mom for having your back though, at least you know you have her on your side to help you through this. You can always PM me if you need to talk :/",
            "Oh man. I know how it feels to be disappointed in your parent. You expect them to make the right choice. It seems sooo clear to you what they should choose. But it's not clear to them. Their perception is clouded by short-term self-interest. They choose what will make them short-term happy. It's frustrating. Just do yourself a favor and never expect him to be a perfect father. Don't waste time waiting for him to get better. He's going to make more bad decisions and you have to choose whether to help him or to see him crash and burn. Either way, know what you are sacrificing and how much you are investing. Focus on your education and what you want to do in your life. It hurts to see your parents make unhealthy decisions. You're not alone. <3",
            "My dad did something similar to me when his wife screamed at me for being on the phone for a minute longer than she wanted me to be on. \nWhen I went back to my mother, I told her what happened and that I wasn't interested in visiting my father anymore. She was sympathetic and let me stay home with her while me sister continued to visit him and his horrible wife for years. \nTell your father that this is a complete overreaction on her part and that until you receive an apology from his wife for her rude behavior, you are going to spend time away from them. If he and Deb are a \"package deal\" then perhaps you need an apology from both of them. Stop talking with him unless the situation absolutely demands it. What he and his wife did were wrong. They are the adults, not you. You were ill, and you were being respectful of their space as best as you could. If that is not good enough, then they don't need to interact with you.",
            "This was me at your age. It really sucks, but it gets better. You are making the right decision by keeping your father and his negative girlfriend away for now. Maybe in the future you guys can build a better relationship as I have had to do with my dad, but for now focus on yourself, your schooling, and what makes you happy. ",
            "Sounds like your dad and Deb are immature, uncaring people. Unfortunately some people are just like that, and it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s anything wrong with you. A man who would pick a girlfriend over his own son has no spine and only cares about his own immediate needs, not his child\u2019s need to have unconditional love and support from him as a father. This is his failure, not yours.",
            "How awful.  I'm so sorry that the adults in your life have let you down so terribly. \n\nI have also suffered from the 'roid rage in my life, and it fucking sucks.  It's not like you're a disgusting beast that deliberately pisses all over the place and expects others to follow behind cleaning it up - sometimes shit literally happens.  Anyone that can't handle occasional gross stuff (like a bit of blood) has no business being in a parental role.  So as much as this sucks, it's probably the right thing for right now.  ",
            "Totally understand how much this sucks, but know that you are entirely in the right, and your father is absolutely, completely wrong. ",
            "You did nothing wrong. In fact, you sound like an incredibly mature, thoughtful young woman. Sadly, Deb isn't quite as grown up as you are. And your dad is not nearly as strong. Don't for a moment think that their unkindness is any reflection on who you are as a person. It just isn't. On some fundamental and likely unconscious level, Deb sees you as a rival for your father's attention. Everything you do is going to get on her nerves. It's a testament to what an awesome person you are that her nastiness didn't start earlier. ",
            "OP, you're young but old enough to know some men are shitty dads. There is nothing you can do to mold him into a halfway decent human being. Best to have limited ties until after he contributes to your education, if at all. Then cut off contact with this schmuck, unless he has a Come Jesus moment and truly wants to make amends. And even then do what you feel is best for you.\n\nYou owe this thing nothing.",
            "Dang that sucks. I hate to say it, but men often choose the \"new woman\" and loads of children get saddled with feelings of unworthiness. I want to tell you that NONE of this is your fault. Deb is awful. I feel like as you're getting older she saw you as more of a \"threat\". She was becoming more territorial. Kind of gross honestly. I would recommend therapy or writing out your feelings in a journal as much as you can. Don't feel this is your fault. It's normal to be sad and feel this, but at the end of the day you need to tell yourself \"I am worthy of being loved\". *hugs*",
            "Maybe it's cause I'm pissy right now but tell your dad that he and \"Deb\" can be a package deal but he just lost his daughter until he puts you first. My biological father choose his girlfriend and her daughter over myself and my 2 sisters. Had I not been 10 and if i had the balls to tell him to fuck off thing would be different. Perhaps telling him how you feel would help. ",
            "Parents who choose their new gf/bf over their *child* are deadbeat trash.\n\nIt\u2019ll be upsetting now but it\u2019s probably better you don\u2019t see him for a while. He\u2019s a shit parent.",
            "Wow I am baffled that a grown man would say the \"package deal\" about him and his *girlfriend*... to his daughter... \n\n\nSorry, that sucks. Hope your mom does more to support you",
            "You handled this really well. I'm sorry that it didn't come to a great resolution.\n\nListen. Every parent has to expect that their child/ren will have bathrooms accidents. It happens. Grown adults have bathroom incidents too. There's nothing for you to feel embarrassed or bad about.\n\nYour father and Deb handled it really poorly. That isn't your fault. That's a poor reflection on them as adults. There's no excuse for the way Deb shouted at you, and there's no excuse for your dad taking her side.\n\nIf you find yourself upset about this whole ongoing situation, make sure to talk to your mum about how you feel. Or if you feel like you can't talk to her for whatever reason, speak to your school counsellor or ask to see a counsellor outside of school. Sometimes just venting to someone can help.\n\nAnd if anyone tries to pressure you into going to your dad's house and potentially seeing Deb when you don't want to, don't listen to them. You don't have to do anything you don't want to. Deb and your dad are the ones who are in the wrong here, not you, and it's up to them to apologise and try to make it up to you - not the other way around.",
            "Hey I'm sorry to see it didn't work out. If I may I'd like to share my personal expirience with step-parents. \n\nI got and get into arguments with my family regularly. I've always considered it healthy for everyone to express what they are feeling openly, even if they are wrong. In the end we always made up and learned things. I know I don't know your personal story but this is just my experience.",
            "I'm so sorry.  As a dad I could never treat my child like your dad treated you.",

And that really made me see how in the wrong kevin was. \n\nKevin and I broke up right after that incident. It made me realize a lot of things about our relationship that I guess I wasn't seeing clearly before. He really was arrogant and manipulative. He had this way of saying things that made it sound like he was right 100% of the time and that anything I said was stupid. It wasn't until after I read all of the comments that overwhelmingly said he was in the wrong that I realized just how manipulative he was. Maybe I should mention that kevin was really hot, like REALLY HOT so maybe thats why I didn't realize how much of an ass he was until way later lol.\n\nAnyway, this isn't so much of an update as to our relationship, it's a funny story I heard. I've been working a summer job for the past while now in my hometown where both kevin and I live. It's not a tiny town where everyone knows each other but its not huge either. Anyway at work I was talking with some of my coworkers on break and the conversation of terrible exes came up. The story that my one coworker decided to share was about... you guessed it... kevin.\n\nApparently they dated about a year ago. my coworker (lets call her (brenda) had to go to her cousins wedding and kevin was her plus one. During the ceremony, kevin got really bored, and he decided to let everyone know. Apparently he started saying stuff like \"oh my god this is taking so long\" and \"is it almost over yet?\" and he kept going on and on. He wasn't so loud that everyone could hear him but the people around him definitely could, brenda said a lot of people were turning their heads to look at them, she was super embarrassed. Apparently they got in a huge fight between the ceremony and reception and that was the end of their relationship. LOL I couldn't help but laugh when I heard that story. Sounds exactly like something kevin would do.\n\nAnyway thats it for my update. Things are going well for me, I'm currently enjoying single life. Just working and hanging out with friends. One of the things that kevin said that really bothered me was that religion never does anything good. That really bothered me so I started volunteering with a  charity that my church helps run once a week, just organizing stuff thats been donated. Maybe I let him get to me but it feels good to help out. I dont hold anything against atheists, you guys totally convinced me that the problem was kevin and that many atheists are cool. So thank you for that!\n\ntldr: turns out my ex bf was a jerk in his other relationships as well. No surprise there!",

            "That's *great* that you're volunteering with a charity. Talk about turning a negative experience into a positive one! Even if your ex never finds out about it, the good you're doing for your community completely counteracts the selfishness his presence brings to it.\n\n> He had this way of saying things that made it sound like he was right 100% of the time and that anything I said was stupid.\n\nMy ex would do this too. He would argue and argue a point, refusing to acknowledge any truth to my side of the argument, and keep going (sometimes for hours) until I admitted I was wrong and he was right. If I snapped at him or said something in a particular tone, he'd say, \"Don't be a dick,\" as if my dickishness completely invalidated my entire argument. It got to the point that, if we were raring up to argue, I would just stop it and tell him, \"You're right, okay? Let's just drop this.\" After we broke up, he admitted that he would continue to argue a point past when he actually believed it, past the point where I'd convinced him that I was right, just to see if he could get me to admit that I was wrong. It was some sick game to him.\n\nWhat helped me to get past these memories was writing it all down. I opened up a Google Doc (great because you can access it anytime, so long as you have an Internet connection) and made a list of all the manipulative, gross things my ex did. Then I was free to delete emails, text messages, everything - if I wanted to think about anything specific, all I would have to do is refer to the document. But until then, I could let it go. If you feel like your ex is still getting to you, feel free to give this method a try.\n\nIn any case, I'm glad you're doing so well being single. You've got a great head and an even better heart. Even this stranger on the Internet can tell that you'll be just fine.",

            "This will likely get buried in the comments, but oh man, reading the update and the OP brings back not so great memories of my atheist ex boyfriend. He did a lot of annoying things, but sometimes when his mother would say grace at dinner (she was the only religious member of the family) he would say, \"HAIL SATAN!\" or something similar after she was done speaking or he would just generally complain about why grace needed to be even said. He was 26-27 at the time, too. My ex and his mother even once got into an argument about religion after one of his outbursts at the table. He instigated it, of course. The other family members will tell him to knock it off, but he was extremely stubborn (shocker).\n\nThis was after his mother was kind enough to make him dinner even though he often complained it wasn't paleo enough and would sometimes complain if pasta was made as a side dish (\"How can you eat that garbage?\"). He told me that she often pushed religion on him, saying that he needed god and what not, but she was a kind person and not at all demanding. I'm sure that they had plenty of back and forth, but she is a respectful person. She had tried to get me to go to mass with her a few times and I always said no and that was the end of it. On the other hand, my ex had a not very nice way of saying things that he felt exceptionally passionate about. My ex was kind of mean to his mother in general as he was the type to take his anger out on other people (me included). \n\nI'm glad that OP and I got rid of our jerkwad exes. :)",

I think religion is what you make of it, and having something to love and fight for and believe in causes people to do many good things, just like you and volunteering.

One of my first submissions on reddit was a Facebook reply I made about religion on /r/atheism that I have since deleted. I thought everyone  there would get a kick out of my reply and love it. They all said I was an asshole and downvoted it. I'm not an asshole, at least I try not to be one, and it just woke me up to how I should act in those situations.

            "Sounds like he's just an all-around douche. While religious beliefs are considered to be a big worldview thing to differ on, meaning you are far more likely to work out with someone who holds beliefs like your own, I hope it hasn't put you off to all atheists. My fiance is atheist and I'm agnostic. His family is Southern Baptist and we live in the bible belt. It is not a requirement of non-belief to disrespect and degrade other people's spiritual beliefs and practices, so long as they don't deeply infringe on your own personal liberties to not believe. When we attend dinner at their invite, they pray before meals, we respectfully bow our heads along with them, we don't say 'amen' but everyone else does so no one notices that. I see it sort of like respect for another culture. If I go to some country in Asia, I take my shoes off at the door and eat the meal they kindly prepared for us without criticizing their personally constructed meaning in life. Call me crazy. Likewise they have never come to dinner at our request and forced the table to pray first. I think it's just common courtesy. If it holds no personal meaning to you, you should regard it as such, rather than a personal attack on all things you hold dear. People have different opinions and beliefs. You be nice and act courteous regardless. This is the civil world we live in. Sheesh, Kevin.",

My grandfather is an atheist which my mom knew but at the time she didn't know just how militant he was about it. \n\nWhen the JoP started the prayer rather than just sitting quietly and waiting for it to be over like most reasonable atheists, he got up and started walking around the room looking at the stuff hanging on the walls. I always knew my grandfather was a bit of an asshole but that was a bit ridiculous even for him.

        "selftext": "I recently won an all-expense paid trip to Disney World for four nights, for myself and three guests. I am currently planning on bringing my boyfriend [30M] , my mother [54F], and my boyfriend's mother [50sF]. I know we all aren't exactly Disney's key demographic, but it honestly means a lot to our mothers that I am inviting them. Both my boyfriend and I grew up in poorer families that could never afford expensive vacations, and this is the first trip to Disney World for all of us. I know this is probably the only opportunity our mothers will ever have to go to Disney, and for now they are both in good enough health to still enjoy the rides.\n\n\nThe problem is with my cousin, Jane [30F], who has been hounding me to take her 5-year-old daughter, Kelly, instead of my boyfriend's mother. I know, I know, what kind of monster am I for not wanting to bring a little girl to the place where dreams come true?! Except Jane's family has already been to Disney World twice, most recently earlier this year in February. My cousin has done very well for herself - she runs a successful photography business, and her husband is an engineer. They are definitely able to afford their own vacations. If Jane wasn't so well off, I probably would consider taking Kelly if I thought I was giving a little kid a once in a lifetime experience. But I'm not. She's already been twice and she's only five! Our mothers have been ZERO times. Jane's only rationale for wanting me to take her daughter seems to be that \"Disney is meant for kids. It's weird to go with only adults.\" and \"It'd be evil to not take a 5 year old to Disney if you had the chance.\" \n\n\nThere's also the issue of Kelly herself. She's not a completely terrible child, but she's whiny and throws tantrums regularly. I don't really want to spend a week with that. Also, what if she gets homesick, what if she gets actually sick, what if she gets lost?! I'm not a parent myself and I would have no idea what to do in those situations. I also don't want to saddle my mother with the responsibility of caring for her. I've babysat Kelly before, but only for a few hours at a time. I'm not sure why my cousin is even comfortable with the idea of me taking her child three states away.  We are in North Carolina, so it's not like Orlando is just a short drive down the road if something happens. \n\n\nI tried telling Jane I'm not comfortable bringing Kelly, and she just said this is a good opportunity to find out what being a parent is like. What?! She's almost acting like I'm not serious about not bringing Kelly, and I'm just pretending I don't want to bring her. It's really weird. Jane and I have always been very close, like we are sisters, and I'm afraid this has the potential to ruin our relationship once it comes to a head. What is the best way to tell her no without sounding like an evil child hater, or am I being selfish for not taking a kid to Disney?\n\n\nTL;DR: I won a trip to Disney World, cousin wants me to bring her spoiled young daughter instead of boyfriend's mother and I don't want to.",

Coincidentally, I was discussing almost the exact opposite issue regarding my own daughter (we also live in NC, and in this case, the issue is a family member asking if they can take our daughter to Disney World at some point). And personally there is no way I'd want that to happen until she's at an age when she can pretty much almost be responsible for herself on a trip like that.

            "No, don't take Jane's child.  My sister has taken my son on vacations, but only when *she* asks for him to go, I *never* would insist he go with them on vacations.  That is tacky, pushy, and rude.  \n\nI have also taken my niece's on vacations out of state, but that is when I requested they go, my sister would never insist I take them, because we are adults and not pushy monsters.  \n\nJane wants you to pay (by way of a ticket to disney world) to babysit her child for free for five days, when you have already made arrangements for who goes.  How is that acceptable?\n\n",

            "I worked for Disney for about half a year on an internship. Literally worked in the middle of the Magic Kingdom. Jane is absolutely bonkers if she thinks Disney is only children.

You are fortunate enough to not have children yet and to be able to experience Disney World without a child.

Your cousin sounds entitled and manipulative.  Tell her no and sleep well - you conscience is clear.",
            "Husband and I did part of our honeymoon at Disney. It was spectacular... he had never been and I had been once with my relatively poor family (my family stayed in a cheap motel, didn't eat in the park, and only did 1 day). Honestly, there is a level of Disney that kids (especially little kids) just can't appreciate.\n \nIt would be win-win for Jane if you took the kid. Kid gets some fun and Jane gets a mini vacation from being a parent. It would be lose-lose for you. This is your vacation, not Jane's, not Jane's kid's. \n \nTell her \"NO\". This is a long-overdue trip for 4 people who have never been. And if she says she doesn't understand that then tell her that's because she's already gone a few times. It's your turn. She needs to respect your choice.\n \nAnd then be prepared to hang up on her if she does something manipulative like put her kid on to ask. That would be a reason to go \"no contact\" for a while. But hopefully she won't stoop to that.\n \nHope you, the boyfriend, and the moms have a blast!",

I obviously am bringing my son (doesn't count as a ticket since he is under 2) and my husband. Next I wanted to bring my in laws since they have done so much for us and will help with the baby. So I had two tickets left and chose my sister in law (who is my best friend) and her husband. My brother and sister were pissed I didn't invite my brother, his wife, their 5 year old and my sister (as well as my brothers baby and sisters baby who are both under 2). I get that my nephew has never been (neither has any of my family), but 3 kids under 2 sounds awful, and one of the two is a very uncooperative baby. \n\nI ended up telling them it was my trip, not the families, not the kids, mine so I get to choose. I think going this route is best. No mention of why you don't want to bring the kid, just that it is your trip and you want to have a good time, not be responsible for someone else's child. ",

I don't think you should be pressured to take a child that isn't your own on a holiday that you've won (which gives her actual mother a break). This is mean to be a relaxing break for you and chasing a child around (and being unable to enjoy the *adult* roller coasters with a 5 year old) will be anything but relaxing.

I've been with friends and their kids and it's such a different experience. They throw tantrums, get upset over tiny things, and typically can't stay out late to enjoy the fun nighttime activities. I love going with my friends and seeing the kids reactions to things, but you have every right to take your boyfriend's mother. You don't want to have to play mommy the whole time, and you'll enjoy it so much better! A ton of adults make trips on their own without children. It's completely normal there.

She can get herself something to eat and rest for a bit, or communicate the need to do that.\n\nWith a kid along, you're limiting the activities you can do, the places you'll see, the places you'll eat, how long you'll stay out each night and when you get up every morning.\n\nGo with your boyfriend and your moms. Enjoy yourself. Tell your cousin that this is a once in a lifetime thing for all of you and you want it to be adult only. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

            "As everyone else has said, tell her no. She's not entitled to anything in this situation. \n\nDisney is a lot of fun for adults! My husband and I went with my in laws when we were 24. We had a blast. ",
            "Nope. You are totally right to say no. She's been before. Taking both your moms is a lovely idea.",
            "Jane needs to take her head out of her own ass.\n\nMy daughter would love to go (we are in UK) but its not going to happen. I sure as hell wouldnt pester other family members to take her.\n\n",
            "It's weird for adults only to go to Disney?\n\nUh-no.  Most people are still kids at heart and would love going! I mean comeon, Epcot is basically Disney for adults!\n\nMy hubby and I are planning out our 4year anniversary to go to California, and he knew it would mean the world if we did our actual anniversary day in Disneyland since it's been a childhood dream of mine to see\n\nHell the last time I was finally able to get to Disney World was about 6 years ago and *GASP* I went all by myself! For two days. I seriously had a great time. \n\nYour niece will barely remember these trips anyway she's so young. ",
            ">Disney is meant for kids. It's weird to go with only adults.\n\nThat is SO NOT TRUE.",
            "Sounds like Jane just wants to dump Kelly onto you and your mother for a few days so she can experience the child-free lifestyle again.",
            "You've already made the arrangements. That's it. If she is going to be petty enough to let this drive a wedge, then... But she won't. I feel like she wants you to take her kid so she can have a free vacation from her daughter or alone time with her husband. Stick to your original plans and take the people who have never been!!",
            "Ridiculous. You're fine.  Have a magical day",
            "No it's weirder that your cousin wants you to take her 5 year old on vacation.  \nMy parents took us when we were super little (barely remember that trip) and it was frustrating for the whole family.  We went back when we were in high school and according to my parents it was way better.",
            "It's not good to take responsibility of a kid, especially one that isn't yours. Decline ",
            "\"Jane, this is not up for discussion.  I am taking my mother, boyfriend and boyfriend's mother.\"  End of conversation.\n\nDon't Justify, Argue, Defend, or Explain (Jade) here.\n\nJane's child is not entitled to your things.  Jane is not entitled to tell you how to use the prize that you won.  Stop telling Jane anything except 'no'.",
            "Don't give in, she will do it again when the opportunity arises ",
            "Fuck Jane. \n\nYou are going to have a GREAT time on an all-expense paid to Disney World for four nights with your boyfriend, your mum and your boyfriend's mum.",
            "Then don't it's your price not hers. You decide who you invite along with you. ",
            "Yeah, no. You do not have to bring her daughter at all. I think it is very sweet that you would if it was a once in a lifetime opportunity, but it isn't for her. Her parents can take her, and have, any time. Plus, Disney is NOT just for kids at all. Disney is AMAZING for adults! We are huge, huge Disney fans and while we adore taking our 6 yr old because obviously we love him and blah blah, we are so darn excited for our anniversary trip next year. My husband has been with his parents as an adult as well. It is just different with only adults, with kids, especially ones that young, everything changes. You have to work around their schedules, their needs, you can't stay out as late, you may not get to eat where you want, there are rides you will have to swap going on if she isn't tall enough/scared. Like I said, totally different. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for YOU, YOU won the trip and YOU should take it in whatever way YOU would most enjoy. Sometimes in life it is perfectly acceptable to do exactly what we want. ",
            "Stick to your guns. Take your mothers. As someone who first went to Disney World aged 21 with my parents (also first time for them, too!) it was a truly magical experience, *even* as adults. Was the best holiday we've ever had. I know your cousin from her perspective thinks it's a no brainer, but that's *her* perspective. Go, enjoy your trip with your OH, mother and mother-in-law! Say hello to my second home for me. ",
            "On mobile, can't find the link but this situation definitely calls for the gif of Bender laughing at Leela. \"oh wait - you're serious? Let me laugh even harder!\"",
            "Hell no. \n\nWe took my in laws ( both mid 70s) to florida ( including disney) this April.  It was great. Zero kids meant we stuck to what we adults wanted to do. No riding it's a small world 50 times in a row. Eating at nice restaurants in an evening. We had an awesome time as an early 30s, late 30s and mid 70s group. Disney just for kids my ass! \n\nAt 5 they're not exactly of an age to spend all day at a theme park, nor can they go on some of the rides. If you  tske kiddo this trip will be 90% what they want to do. Or it will involve you  splitting up as a group to take care of the kid. \n\nAs others have said. No is a complete answer. Stick to your guns. It's your prize. Use it as you see fit.",
            "1) The logic that Disney World is only for kids is what prevents people from taking some awesome vacations! (Why does Epcot and it's multitude of adult beverage stands exist if that place wasn't built for adults.) Seriously go check out any of the Disney park subreddits for some great planning advice, especially if the two moms haven't gone ever. If you want some planning help, I come from a family like Jane's that was blessed with the resources to take multiple trips, PM any questions you have and I'll help you plan an awesome trip for you, your boyfriend and the moms!\n\n2) It sounds like Jane wants some free babysitting. And that's what that trip would turn into. Being a veteran Disney family vacationer, a 5 year old is WAY to young to go without her own mother. Most likely your mom would end up back in the room early every day with a sleepy kindergartner. \n\n3) Explain it to Jane exactly like you did to us. You won this trip and you think it would mean a lot for the two moms to enjoy it with you and your boyfriend. It will also give the moms some time to bond if this is the direction your family is going. Having your mom get along with a possible future mother-in-law make life so much easier down the road. (though if I'm reaching to far ignore this last bit)",
            "Say no. Simple. Don't JADE (as others have said).    \nIf she is trying to get you to JADE (But WHY?!) simply go \"because I said No\"   \n    \nIt's YOUR trip, not hers. YOU decide.",
            "She's upset because she doesn't know how boundaries work. This is YOUR trip, and you decide how it's going to go.\n\nTaking someone else would be NICE.\n\nAnd not taking someone else is NEUTRAL. (It's not \"bad\".) She shouldn't be upset at neutral.\n\nBe confident in your own boundaries, and stand your ground.\n\nFinal thoughts: Disney has plenty of things for adults. And even a lot of the \"kid things\" are fun for adults, too.",
            "Tell Jane in a polite way to fuck off! No means no!",
            "She just wants a free babysitter for a week so she can go do adult things. Ignore her whenever she brings it up until she understands that the topic is a no go. ",
            "Do not make your trip about a spoiled child. This is YOUR trip. Not your cousins child's vacation. Take whom ever you want.",
            "When she brings it up, say \"Jane, I've already told you I'm not bringing Kelly.  I'm tired of talking about this.  Stop bringing it up.\"  You are not being selfish at all.  You won the trip, so you should enjoy it.  She's the one being selfish, acting like she's entitled to your trip.",
            "I would just say that it is your choice, and that since Kelly has already been twice, it's time to bring people who have never been.  ",
            "Lmao tell her no. \"NO\". Not just for kids my wife has been planning a trip for us and our mothers for a year now. No kids just us and I can't wait. Her moms never been and it's been 20 years for mine and myself. Good luck!",
            "Disney is actually for adults as well. I know so many childless couples that go every year and enjoy it. this is a great trip and so thoughtful of you to bring your mother and your BF's mother. you guys are going to have a great time!",
            " \"Disney is meant for kids. It's weird to go with only adults.\"\n\nShe has to be kidding or just delusional.  I've been to DW about, oh, 10 times in the past 12 years with my wife, kids, in-laws.  My most favorite trip was the long weekend my wife and I took to DW with just ourselves.  World Showcase at Epcot...yeah, that's for adults.  Take who you want and get a mango margarita with a pomegranate floater in Mexico sweetened with the tears of entitled mothers and their children everywhere.",
            "if the child has already been. Oh fucking well. You are under 0 obligation to take this child. Just because she is a child doesn;t mean shit. Take who you want to take and if your cousin hates you for it so be it. She can afford to take her own kid, obviously.",
            "\"Jane, I'm sorry but I have already promised my mother and my boyfriends mother.\" There you go. If she wants to throw a fit and hate you for it, that just shows what kind of shitty person she is. ",
            "This is a vacation, you bring a 5 year old who you are responsible for will mean, NO VACATION. WORK WORK WORK",
            "As everyone here has already said, you are completely correct to say no and keep saying no and don't owe her any more than that. \n\nIf you still feel guilty after reading all the comments maybe say something to your cousin to the effect if \"oh it'd be great for you guys to come. We're going at *date* and staying at *hotel* if you wanted to book something and hang out while we're there\"\n\nYou've already said they can afford it, but since they've been recently it's doubtful they'll actually crash your party if they're the ones footing the bill. Might help turn her dialog from \"you won't take my child to disney\" to SHE won't take her child to Disney. ",
            "ugh going to a theme park with a child, if you are not their parent just sucks so hard - your whole day is focused on them (as it should be, it's a kid!) meal times, rest times, ride wait times, ride \"scariness\" - all dictated by them.  \n  \nGo have a blast with your boyfriend and your mamas. Jane/Kelly are not entitled to the trip.",
            "Bringing someone else's kid(s) on vacation is a huge responsibility. Not to mention, to a place as big as Disney World. Just tell Jane a firm no. If she is as close like a sister as you mentioned, then she should understand why bringing both mothers are a better idea on this adult trip. Theres plenty of things to do for adults at Disney. And I have more fun as an adult than as a child!",
            "I would just block/ignore Jane. You can't win with those people so just turn them off. ",
            "You ARE the Disney WORLD demographic. It's a resort and largely has things to do for adults. Disney LAND is for kids.\n\nSay no, you can bring whoever you want.",
            "As a parent, I see your cousins actions as selfish.  \n\nI read that as her wanting to get rid of her kid for a week to gain some freedom and the whole \"see what it's like to be a parent\" thing sounds like she is jealous of your freedom and wants to take you down a peg (i also suffer from this kind of jealousy, i just keep it to myself like a good parent and a good adult). \n\nI would love for someone to take my kid for a week so I can be free for a week.  But I would never push someone who doesn't want to do it.\n\nI fully understand the phrase \"you see the world through your own eyes\" and since I am in the trenches of crazy toddlerhood my interpretation of this entire thing could be completely off.\n\nGood luck!",
            "As a 25 year old who went on vacation there with girlfriend last year, an adult only trip to Disney is an absolute blast. It gives you a vastly different perspective of the parks, and you enjoy it just as much as when you were kid.\n\nI don't find it weird to go as an adult, appreciate the level of details that each park has to maintain to be as functional as they are, unleash your inner kid, and have a blast.",
            "\"No.\" Is a full sentence."
