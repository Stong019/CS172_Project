        "selftext": "Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4x4iwk/i_29f_had_a_nightmare_relationship_with_an_older/\n\nWell, thanks for your feedback, guys. Wanted to give you an update.\n\nSo something I failed to mention in my last post is that my mom used to teach at my alma mater before she recently retired. She didn't know about my brief relationship with Kevin years ago. After writing my post, I decided to share with her everything that happened.\n\nMom immediately got this weird look on her face and said she knew exactly who I was talking about because she used to teach in my department. She said, \"I don't think Kevin will be a problem for you.\" When I asked why, she said, \"Trust me, you'll see. That guy is kind of a loser.\"\n\nSo I went to the event, and it was amazing. I took some of the advice here and brought a girlfriend so I would never be alone in case Kevin tried to pull something. I met a bunch of alumni and ran into a couple people who I lost touch with when I got sick. Everybody were thrilled to hear how well I'm doing, and my speech got an ovation when I was done.\n\nAnyway, Kevin showed up with his wife. I don't know how to say this without sounding mean, but he's gotten fat and is going bald. I was surprised at how old he looked until someone told me he's almost 50 now (which means he lied to me when we were dating and said he was younger than he really was). Also, I heard from old classmates that Kevin is **still** studying for his degree, plus working nights as a security guard now.\n\nKevin was the only person at the event who avoided me. Like, it was obvious. I thought he was going to avoid me all night until I accidentally found myself alone for 30 seconds, which is when he nervously approached me to congratulate me. I smiled, said thanks, and kept moving. He tried cracking a dumb joke to me later but I just ignored him, which seemed to frustrate him. Overall I just spent the night focused on the people around me and forgot he existed.\n\nInterestingly, he managed to repeatedly piss off a bunch of people (including his wife and one of the deans) throughout the night with stupid comments. It got so bad that people started a running joke about what an insensitive moron Kevin was.\n\nI'm so glad I went and didn't allow one jerk from my past to make me hide. I had a great time and was surprised at how unafraid I felt when I saw Kevin again. The memories from that time of my life were so traumatic but now he's just some jackass I once knew. I'm not sure now WTF I ever saw in him or why I was ever scared of him.\n\nOh, and by the way, I recently started a great new job that came with a big raise, which means I'll have my student loans paid off this year. Life is good. Thanks for your help, Reddit.\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr: Ran into asshole ex and realized he can't hurt me. Had a fun time meeting people and ignoring him.**\n\nEDIT: Aw, the comments got locked fast. Two things I wanted to add:\n\n* an acquaintance recently told me that apparently Kevin and his now wife were in an open relationship for a long time (including while he and I were together), and that she closed the relationship again a few years ago because she got annoyed. I can only imagine the shenanigans. I feel better knowing he didn't cheat on her, even though he still cheated on **me**, and of course he didn't tell me about his wife at all. Whatever.\n\n* My favorite part of the evening: I blocked Kevin on Facebook years ago, so he's had NO updates whatsoever on my life including the fact that I go by my birth name now. In college, everybody called me by a nickname, but no one's used it now in years. So all night he kept calling me by this super old nickname. People kept looking at him like he was crazy and asking, \"Why are you calling her that?\", and Kevin got super frustrated because he realized everybody was in on some joke that he didn't understand. No one would clue him in, I guess.",

I bought her a gift from the registry that was reasonably priced ($40ish or more) and had it delivered directly to her house. I arrived to the party on time and the vibes were really off. The girls there didn\u2019t greet me as they were still setting up a large balloon arch (I wasn\u2019t early, they just seemed to be running behind). They asked me to help with the balloons and I did, but no one made any small talk towards me. It had the vibe of a room full of people who have been gossiping about you. It could also very well be that they were busy and tired from decorating. Sarah mostly ignored me the entire night. I stayed and chatted with other friends, ooo-d and aww-d at baby gifts and photos, and in no way made her time about me. I won the price is right game they put on (which they said they would give gift cards as prizes but never did). I didn\u2019t mention the prize, my Christmas gift, or my recent birthday. I gave hugs, wrote a thoughtful note in her guest book, and after 2.5 hours excused myself to go to dinner with another group of friends to celebrate my birthday. I don\u2019t regret going, but it is clear this friendship has mostly run its course. It was good closure. I wish her the best and am likely not going to give the relationship much energy moving forward. \n\nThank you all for your kind and thoughtful replies to my last post.\n\nTLDR: went to the shower and it went about how we all thought it would go, but it was nice to see friends.",

            "This sounds like how my friendship with my ex best friend died except I couldn't bring myself to attend her birthday party and face her group of friends who I knew she'd spoken about me too, I commend you for going and how you handled the situation.",
            "If nothing else, you have proven yourself to be a good person and a good friend. You can walk away from this situation with your head held high, knowing you acted with grace and generosity. No one can say you didn't try for Sarah. \n\nBut do not waste another second of energy on this friendship.",
            "This is very similar to what I'm going through at the moment. Sometimes friends come in to your life for a reason, a season or a lifetime, but it's always a difficult pill to swallow when you thought the person pulling away was a 'lifetime' friend. Well done for showing up with grace, and know that you did everything you could. You can start to grieve now and put your energy into relationships that reciprocate the same energy you give. X",
            "I think you did the right thing. You went out on good terms and with no regrets. It's sad, but sometimes friendships naturally end as we move into different stages of life. Maybe your friend (ex-friend sounds more like it) will regret how she treated you.  \n\nEither way, she can't ever be like \"She [you] didn't even come to my baby shower so what kind of friend was she really?\"",

            "I had a friend like that except we met over having babies and got close fast. It was a fun supportive five years but then she stopped answering my calls when my mom died. Some friendships run their course and its really hard. It was her, that was her M.O. I saw her do it to the friend before me, and move on to the next after me.",
            "OP this update comes off as very mature. Good job at adutling and being a good person.",
            "Going through a painful splitting apart of a friendship in my own life. It's never fun but I think you are doing the right thing.

            "I've been to a few weddings where I walked out and knew that this was also a send off to our friendship in addition to the wedding itself.  \n\nI've found the same as you did, that its good closure.  I consider the gift (and associated cost) a parting gift.  Something to know I did one last nice thing before I likely would never see them again.  I actually prefer this to allowing the relationship to fizzle out and feeling like you never really marked a point in time when it ended.  You get to share a (hopefully) nice moment as a way to remember them in your life.",
            "This is probably the most mature, and adult way to close out a friendship that has, very obviously, run its course.\n\nThat vibe you had? About them likely gossiping about you before you came? I guarantee you your gut is 150% correct. Your ex-friend literally invited you there to get one last drop of blood out of the stone that was your friendship.\n\nPay them no further mind. You did great!",

            "This hurts to read because I went through a similar process with a friend and it also ended in a baby shower. It wasn't a 6 year friendship though, so OP I can only imagine how much that hurt. I hope you had a great birthday and meet more compatible friends.",

            "Sometimes group events feel more hostile than they really are when there's a tight group of people there and they don't make an effort to include everyone. It doesn't always mean they're assholes, it might just mean theyre bad at hosting events.\n\nIf you want to rekindle things, maybe meet for brunch or something 1 on 1 with your friend. That's really only if you want to though. I think it's also OK to just recognize you're not really friends anymore too.",
            "Sounds like she has lost an exceptional friend. Good luck to ypu and most importantly, happy bornday.",

            "Honestly, this update is a breath of fresh air. It\u2019s just nice to read that OP did the courteous thing for her friend, followed through on what seems to have been an awkward event, bowed out respectfully at the appropriate time and moved on. No drama, even though she would have had the right to confront her pregnant friend, if not at the party, at some point. \n\nI always tell my kids that people come in and out of your life. Experiences, priorities, lifestyles all affect relationships and it\u2019s just normal for friendships to run their course. It happens and isn\u2019t necessarily anyone\u2019s fault, although there are often hurt feelings. This one certainly seemed to be one sided for a while, which is a huge red flag. Best to just move on and not hold grudges. Good on you, OP. Hope you had a happy birthday!!",
            "I think you walked away being able to be proud of how you\u2019ve handled the situation. You showed her kindness, effort and empathy to the very last moment while also being able to realize this was probably one of the last times you\u2019ve seen her. I think you handled it wonderfully, no matter how painful dying friendships are.",
            "You chose to be the bigger person in the situation. But being the bigger person is highly overrated. When someone says to be the bigger person, they often mean ignore the problem, suppress your feelings, and offer kindness and empathy, whether they deserve it or not. Do this until the other person miraculously realizes they\u2019ve been an AH, or you boil over with resentment and end the relationship.\r\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. There are times when being the bigger person makes sense\u2014with people who have demonstrated an inability to change, who you are somehow forced to spend time with i.e. family. Sometimes grinning and bearing is the only alternative to a bloody pile of carnage. But sometimes, we should choose carnage.\r\n\nBeing a good friend does not mean being the bigger person. True friendships are between people of roughly equal size. Both require love, effort, and attention. Both are willing to give and receive. Part of the reason you\u2019re not getting what you need from your friend is that you\u2019ve slowly taken on the role of being the bigger person. Ignoring slight after slight. Giving gifts and care packages and emotional support and never letting on that you need these things, too.\r\n\nAs I read your original post, I kept waiting for the part where you tell your friend how you feel. If you did, fair enough\u2014kick her to the curb. But there are so many instances where you hold back instead of saying what\u2019s on your mind. Namely: *Where\u2019s my present? Where\u2019s my invite? Where\u2019s my \u201chow are YOU doing\u201d? Where is my m\\*\\*f\\*\\*ing gift card?!*\r\n\nAnd I get it, there was a pandemic and a move and she got pregnant. It\u2019s never a good time to tell someone they\u2019re being an AH. But unless it\u2019s their literal wedding day or somebody died that week, it\u2019s okay to tell them you\u2019re upset. The sooner you tell them, the better.\r\n\nIf you haven\u2019t, you need to sit your friend down and gently tell her all the ways she\u2019s let you down over the past few years. Tell her that none of these things in and of themselves would amount to much, but all together they make you feel like she doesn\u2019t value you as a friend. Altogether, they\u2019ve convinced you that she doesn\u2019t want you in her life.\n\n\rAll lasting relationships eventually reach the point where one person hurts the other\u2014often without realizing it\u2014and it\u2019s up to someone to be the bigger person, not by repressing our feelings and acting as if everything is fine, but by being messy and vulnerable and honest.\n\n\rIf you haven\u2019t told her yet, I can guarantee that your friend has no idea that you are carrying this (totally understandable) load of hurt and resentment. I can guarantee that she has not considered that each act of overlooking you adds weight to the pile. I can promise you that she is too busy processing the weight of her own actions\u2014like moving in with her parents during COVID, or having a child\u2014to consider how her inactions have affected you.\r\n\nAnd you might call that selfish\u2014I certainly would. But I would also file it under \u2018human\u2019 and \u2018forgivable\u2019. I might even be so bold as to label it *an opportunity for mutual growth and understanding??*\r\n\nYou both should also recognize the new weight on your relationship\u2014that your lives are moving in opposite directions. You\u2019re both at an age where you are forced to make decisions that until now seemed happily hypothetical. Some of those decisions are societally sanctioned with parties, presents and balloon arches, while others (sadly) are not. But don\u2019t let all this pomp and crepe paper fool you. Behind every huddle of happy mothers is a list of complaints and *what ifs?*\r\n\nI\u2019m not trying to imply that all childfree people secretly want kids or that all mothers secretly regret having them. I\u2019m saying that when we\u2019ve taken a road and there\u2019s no turning back, this can lead to understandable fear and panic, especially in a newly pregnant woman who once thought she\u2019d be child-free.\r\n\nI can\u2019t say for sure that this is what\u2019s happening to you and your friend, but it happens. It happened to me.\r Right before the pandemic hit, my crazy acid-tripping, one-night stand having, artist friend got married to a conservative golf-playing, country club, card carrying family man. And I\u2019ll admit, it was weird. It was hard for both of us at first to talk about our lives, which had once resembled one another. We had our rough patches\u2014she shamed me for sleeping with someone during COVID, and I was an incompetent maid of honor who neglected to purchase matching robes that said \u201cBride Squad\u201d on it.\r\n\nIt may be true that your pregnant, married friend who can\u2019t drink or have sex with a new person theoretically ever again doesn\u2019t want to hear about your wild nights. And you may decide you\u2019re unable to feign enthusiasm about sleep training or breast feeding or that supposedly adorable thing her kid did. It would be fine for one or both of you to choose to spend time with the people who share common ground. But I think often our resistance to people whose lives are different from our own stems not from a lack of interest, but from fear.\r\n\nPeople with lives vastly different than our own present us with the opportunity to doubt our own decisions, covet what we\u2019ve given up. And even if we don't, we still ask: Is she judging me for my choices? Does she even care to hear about my life, when she can\u2019t possibly relate?\n\n\rThe good news is that a good friendship is based on more than shared circumstances. It\u2019s based on the way they tell stories, the way they listen and offer support, their hot takes on the newest season of Love is Blind, a shared fondness for cat memes. You may drift apart\u2014your friend is about to be consumed by motherhood and won\u2019t emerge for a hot minute\u2014but you can still come back to each other, if the friendship is worth it.\r\n\nEventually, my friend and I aired our grievances. We settled in to a new dynamic. We support each other even though we weren\u2019t going through the same things. And a few months ago, it was I who helped her assemble the balloon arch for the \u201csprinkle\u201d celebrating the arrival of her second child. I sh\\*t you not.\n\n\rAs the sprinkle attendees arrived, all of them wealthy, manicured wives and mothers, I, the only childless friend, who\u2019d traveled by bus from New York City where I live happily with one roommate and a cat, braced myself as if I were landing on an alien planet. I could have let my fear of being seen as a freak, an object of curiosity and pity, take over. But instead I chose not to alienate myself. I liked my life and my decisions. I made them for a reason. I decided that they were just as afraid of me as I was of them. We were all happy with (and at times doubtful of) our lives.\n\n\rI\u2019m not going to lie to you and say I had a swinging time at the sprinkle. Did I stand silent on the periphery of many conversations centered on babies? Yes. Did I listen to women complain about their incompetent, non-contributing husbands? Yes. Did I see within the group the same pull of doubt and desire between women who worked and those who didn\u2019t? Yes. Did I learn something? Yes. Am I going to get married, move to the suburbs, and become a SAHM anytime in the near future? Absolutely not.\r\n\nThis is all to say that those women were probably not talking about you before you came into the room. If the vibe was off, it was probably because somebody dropped the f\\*king ball on the balloon arch. In the case of petty social crimes, it\u2019s almost always safer, healthier, and more accurate to assume that people are not thinking about you. They just aren\u2019t.\r\n\nLikewise, I think your friend\u2019s crimes are crimes of omission\u2014being too caught up in her own life to consider yours. And make no mistake, it is a crime, and she should be brought to justice. But I doubt she\u2019s made a conscious decision to cut you out. And if she has, it might be out of fear or insecurity. I bet she\u2019s ignorant of how close she is to losing you as a friend. And if she isn\u2019t, maybe she thinks\u2014after the awkward conversations, you not inviting her to your own birthday party\u2014that you want her lost.\r\n\nOf course, I could be wrong. But I think there\u2019s a reasonable doubt here. I say give her the benefit of the doubt by telling her how you feel. Allow her the opportunity to fix what is broken. Don\u2019t assume she knows your feelings, especially if you\u2019ve done a convincing job of pretending like they don't exist. She deserves to know the hurt she\u2019s inflicted, before you disappear from her life. And you deserve to be seen and heard. You deserve a friend who will send all that generosity and love right back. You deserve to receive your gifts. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for them.\r\n\nTLDR: Tell your friend how you feel before giving up on the relationship. Claim your gifts! Also, I aspire to write an Ask Polly-style advice column one day, so I\u2019m randomly responding to people on Reddit for practice. If you want advice, PM me!",
            "She sounds like one of those shallow creatures who is not comfortable around anyone who isn't a perfect reflection of her lifestyle choices. When she decides to have a child, her childfree friends are dropped. If she embraces a religion, all her current friends who don't embrace that religion will be dropped. When she leaves that religion and starts selling Amway, all her religious friends will be dropped. And so on.",

Why would her friends gossip about *you* in particular? Why do you even feel that? Maybe you\u2019re being too sensitive, but if there\u2019s a there there, then I wonder what it is.",
            "Its most likely that everything is in your head, I seriously doubt she holds any negative feelings towards you. It's a hard pill to swallow and it can hurt, but friendships naturally fade. Especially considering she recently got married and had a kid.",
            "According to your previous post, you made being \"childfree\" part of the identity of your friendship with her.

I didn't include a lot of info bc I didn't want him finding this, but I doubt he reads here sooo:\n\n1. The drinking\u2014he doesn't drink everyday any more. In fact, he stopped drinking for two weeks straight and only had a couple of drinks when he was upset about something. I don't think he's drank since.\n2. The weed\u2014he hasn't stopped smoking, but he has stopped smoking during the day. He'll usually smoke at night before we go to bed and that's kinda it.\n3. We had a conversation about him going to therapy\u2014he's been in the past and had really bad experiences with it. He doesn't trust therapists, and as we all know with therapy, it only works if you want it it. I can't make him go if he doesn't want to. I don't necessarily like this outcome, but until it becomes hazardous to his health, I'm not going to push it.\n4. He didn't trick me into believing that I was the problem. I talked to my therapist, and she pointed out my responses as being emotionally manipulative.\n5. I've been single for most of my life; I don't have a problem being single. I don't need another person to validate me. I just happen to like this one.\n\nReddit, I'm fine. I've been in toxic relationships before that I should have bailed on way earlier. This isn't one of them. You know how I know? Because when we argue, he established the rule that we're on a team, and we're working out a solution together. We obviously don't always remember this, but we've stuck to it. There is no me against him or him against me, it's us against whatever is bringing us down. Also, he made the rule that we should hold hands when we argue or hug after taking a break. It's hard to be mad at someone you're in physical contact with.\n\nAlso, thanks to those of you who left well wishes. I don't think there's a right or wrong in this situation, but I think it's easier to pick at a stranger's flaws than it is to believe in their judgement.\n\ntl;dr: get off my back reddit\n\n\n-----\nPrevious post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cxlxvd/my_28f_partner_33m_doesnt_want_to_commit_to/).\n\ntl;dr from last post: My partner won't commit to being on time, when confronted, said he'll now say \"maybe\" to showing up and never give a time.\n\nSO, after reading this and realizing that my partner was having a problem with drugs/drinking and calling multiple friends, I sat down with him after having a blowout fight and had a real conversation about boundaries. I asked him why he didn't want to commit to showing up, and he said he didn't think it was a big deal because he'd been doing it all his life to everyone. Even his close friends, who have confronted him about as well. He was just raised like that where it was never guaranteed that someone would show up, which seems a bit\u2026weird to me.\n\nSome of the \"laziness\" around showing up had to do with his depression, which I totally get. There have been days where I couldn't even make it out of bed. It's not really a choice you have sometimes.\n\nHe realized that I was really upset about it (finally), and after I said that I need to feel like I can trust his word, he said he'd try. And it's been about a month, and it hasn't been exactly smooth, but he's stuck to his word\u2014shown up when he said he would, communicated when/if he would be more than an hour late.\n\nAnother big thing is that I realized I was behaving in emotionally manipulative ways as well\u2014guilting, shaming, stonewalling. It was in response to his flippancy, but it wasn't helpful for either of us. He's always been calm with me and very clear that he wants to work on our issues together. That's what counts to me.\n\ntl;dr It's not perfect, but we're committed to making it work. We're both growing. (:",

            "So....he\u2019s 33 but never realized that people are generally on time? Does he not have a job? Ever had a doctor or dentist appointment? Ever taken a plane? How does he manage to be on time for those things? \nI think you\u2019re in for a painful relationship with this guy.",
            "Ok, so I've read both of your posts and I have to say that I've dated this type of dude before. The depression, flakiness, substance abuse, total disregard for your feelings/time, lack of empathy etc. I also struggle with anxiety and depression. You know what makes it worse? Dating a guy like this. I am usually a pretty level headed, rational person but with my ex, I was constantly anxious, crying, yelling and absolutely frustrated and it was because I was dating an emotionally cold and immature person. Like your boyfriend, he convinced me that his shitty behavior wasn't the problem, it was actually my \"dramatic/over sensitive/crazy\" reactions to said shitty behavior.  When we broke up, everything changed. I even noticed that my resting heart rate plummeted when we broke up due to my fitness tracker.\n\nI really don't think it sounds like you resolved anything. He's now going to *text* you when he knows he's going to be hours late to hang out with you? Yay. He's said that he's always behaved this way in the past because people in his life just deal with it. Is that really OK to you? What kind of future do you honestly see with someone like this? Reliability is basic necessity to anyone in a relationship.\n\nThis man is 33. He's not going to change. He's going to placate you for a few weeks and then go right back to his BS behavior because you keep putting up with it. Please know there are better partners for you other there that: care about your feelings, will be respectful of your time, won't abuse drugs to the point that they *fall asleep and leave you outside for 30 mins,* etc. I really think you should work on your self respect and self esteem. If you had a healthy relationship with yourself, you wouldn't put up with this.",
            "Were you guilting and shaming? Or did he just feel guilt and shame when you mention shameful things he has done, that he feels guilty about? Asking someone to respect your time is not the same as guilting them for failing to respect your time, even if it makes them feel guilty.",
            "I\u2019m confused. Did I miss the part where you spoke to him about his substance abuse problem? What I read is that there was no resolution to any issue at all.",
            ">communicated when/if he would be more than an hour late\n\nWhoa, if this represents a significant improvement in your relationship, you've set the bar way too low.",
            "Wow, he conned you pretty good into thinking that your concern was you being manipulative.",
            "[removed]",
            "So he's not actually changing his behavior, just talking to you more about it, and you haven't approached dealing with the substance abuse problems or depression? I was in a similar spot when I was your age. I'd met this guy who love bombed me super early on in the relationship-- of course, I didn't know that's what it was at the time. Mildly concerning behaviors also began to peak out, but I was so overwhelmed by the \"good\" stuff that I let it go. Plus, he had an unconventional and somewhat abusive childhood (he would rarely talk about it) and I allowed that to be an excuse for his \"quirky\" behaviors. I ignored his weed abuse because it was \"just\" weed and a coping mechanism for that childhood that I couldn't begin to understand or relate to-- so who was I to want him to stop? I began to fret and worry about traveling to non-legal states because how else could we make sure he had what he needed?\n\nAnd then he pointed out unhealthy behaviors on my part, namely stonewalling. Which I'd never done in a relationship before, *ever*, but developed as a coping mechanism for his abuse. Literally anything I said to him was the \"wrong\" thing and he'd flip out and yell and intimidate. But because I did it-- I stonewalled!-- I felt culpable for the problems in our relationship and like I needed to work harder.\n\nLong, long story short, it didn't get better. It got worse and worse and worse and worse and then it took me six months to safely exit the relationship and avoid the burden of suicide threats. All in the relationship was only 1.5 years, but that was 1.5 years too many and I still am dealing with issues from that relationship today, two years after the relationship ended and nine months into the healthiest, best relationship of my life.\n\n\\--\n\nRelationships are very complicated creatures. It does take two to create them. But there is absolutely no reason to stay in a relationship that is as fraught as yours sounds, especially so early on. This is the honeymoon phase: he is on his very best behavior! As are you, and you've noted that you're not even on your best behavior. It doesn't sound like this is a healthy or very happy situation. Please don't fall prey to the trap of \"well I did something wrong too, so I owe it to the other person to keep trying/forgive them for what they did.\" You don't owe a person your time or effort. The first several months of your relationship should be a delightful getting to know one another-- not to say that there won't be problems, but if you have to work this hard this early, chances are it's only going to get far worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA-- The reason I mentioned that this happened to me when I was your age is that while I don't know you and don't know if this is true for you, I 100% was feeling anxiety about 30 approaching and not having found my life partner so I think I was especially vulnerable to putting up with abusive behaviors. So just putting it out there that being with the wrong person is far worse than being alone AND you're preventing yourself from finding a good partner. Anyway. Good luck; I wish you the best.",
            "OP, this doesn\u2019t sound like that much of an improvement.  He\u2019s still doing the same things, just texting you more about them.  \n\nHe still hasn\u2019t addressed the underlying substance abuse or depression issues in a meaningful way.\n\nDo you think you deserve a partner this terrible?  I\u2019m here to tell you that you don\u2019t.",
            "At 28 you have so many options for dating.. It\u2019s right in that sweet spot age-wise for dating. Please know there are sober, mature, loving men you could be dating who communicate without you mothering them. You could be working on bigger life goals with them rather than working on not lying and not doing drugs. Please consider this before you\u2019re 30 with the same problems.",
            "Holy shit he's manage to turn you into the abusive one?? Girl run, he's way too old to be playing the \"oh yea I was just raised never being on time for anything\" card, this is real life for fucks sake, does he not have a job or anything?? I just got out of a horrible relationship, and every time we fought it was ALWAYS somehow my fault, something I was doing wrong, all the pressure fell on me to fix the relationship when he was abusing me. Also none of the substance abuse seemed to be discussed at all. This isn't an improvement and it's kinda scary that you think it is. Nothing has been fixed",
            "This is pretty grim to read. He texts when he\u2019s going to be *more than an hour* late? And you live an hour apart. So he only considers it necessary to let you know he\u2019s running late if he hasn\u2019t actually left his home by the time he said he would be arriving at yours?\n\nThat\u2019s... not great. The request you\u2019re making is so reasonable- not even to actually BE on time, but just to keep you updated. And he doesn\u2019t even consider you or your time worth that. And he has a substance abuse problem on top of that?\n\nThis reads so much like me when I was in a toxic relationship with a dysfunctional person, clinging to the tiniest shreds of improvement while ignoring the fact that the big things were still a total wreck. \n\nIt\u2019s like getting excited that your partner is dusting for once when they also just set your house on fire.",
            "Yikes. It\u2019s hardly been a month since your last post and he is 33.... this is him, he thinks it\u2019s normal for people to be late and doesn\u2019t want to change. You\u2019re willing to let alcohol and drug abuse slide to keep the status quo. \n\nIn fact, it sounds as though he gaslit you into thinking you were a major part of this issue. \n\nHe is emotionally addicted to alcohol and weed, you aren\u2019t holding him accountable, he has no reason to hold himself accountable. This is going to get worse. \n\nYou are not healthy enough for this relationship. Seriously. Get yourself into counseling and figure out why you\u2019re afraid of being alone to the point that you\u2019ll stay with someone who doesn\u2019t respect your time, abuses substances, and doesn\u2019t give a shit about hurting you.",
            "It sounds like you really want this relationship to work but there are a lot of red flags.\n\nYou both need individual counseling and couples counseling.

Neither of you sound ready for a commitment. I can't imagine how this would end well but I wish you both the very best.",
            "I think you should be wary here. If the behavior doesn't improve to the point of communicating when he will be more than ten minutes late eventually, i wouldn't consider it good enough. I wouldn't put up with being made to wait 45 minutes without so much as a word, and I would NOT accept being told, \"oh but i was under an hour late so it's fine!\"\n\nThere are real, functional adults out there you could date instead.

            "So, is it laziness? Is it depression? Is it the way he was raised? How about lack of respect, commitment issues, irresponsibility? We really don't know, do we, and neither, it seems, do you. Or him.\n\nThis is not the behavior of a person in an adult relationship. Or a loving partner. But we're all over the place trying to determine root cause. And until you do that, you may end of focusing on the wrong problem. \n\nNot only isn't it the behavior of someone in a relationship, normal adults just don't act that way. I'm not trying to rough the guy up, I'm suggesting something else is at play, reason or reasons that may reveal deeper problems. Laziness alone doesn't explain it. Depression may. But something leads me to believe the flag may be a deeper red than you may think.\n\nI'd be interested to know how the rest of your relationship is going. I mean, when he shows up. Is it a loving, adult, mutually respectful one? How do your conversations go? In other words, what else isn't right?\n\nI suggest you may be headed for trouble down the road if this isnt examined thoroughly and fixed. What you may be dealing with is a symptom of the real issue. And if there's one symptom, there generally will be others. Don't wait around for them to manifest. Examine your whole relationship, evaluate where you are, and especially where you are going. Do you like the direction you're headed overall? I bet not, because this level of disrespect for you has to have negative consequences throughout your relationship. You're headed for big trouble, I fear, if this isn't fixed. Best to find out now. Best of luck to you. Ol' Joe",
            "Ok, so, what about the drug/drinking problem? You mentioned it at the top of the post and didn't say anything else about it...",
            "I'm glad there seems to be some progress, but this is really far from a solution OP. As a person with plenty of substance abuse issues of various types weed can be the most tame, but only if his underlying mental health is in check. Smoking weed daily is manageable for a lot of people, but not if it's an escape mechanism for serious depression. Try to get him into therapy, it really can help.\n\nAdditionally, I hope you didn't learn about your \"emotionally manipulative\" way by him framing it that way for you. The way you reacted was not inappropriate or manipulative from what you've detailed, and you should be guilting and shaming him for completely disrespecting your time/relationship. This could very well be an offshoot of gaslighting, and manipulative people are brilliant and being able to convince you that you are the manipulative one. Tread lightly OP, good luck with everything.",
            "The fact that he says hes been doing this to everyone he knows his entire life is not an excuse. Do no accept this as an excuse. He is telling you that he openly is disrespectful to people and even when people close to him have not been okay with this behavior he disregards them and continues to display disrespectful behavior. He is trying to normalize it. However, it's not normal. Do not start tricking yourself into believing that your reactions to his disrespectful behavior is mental abuse. There are a lot of red flags here. I had similar issues with someone I dated. Yes, he had made small efforts but he always resorted back to the same behavior. You have every right to call out his behavior. Tell me, did you realize your reactions were manipulative or did he plant that idea in your head? I'd suggest you take a step back and really look at that. When you feel in your gut that someone isn't treating you right and then they normalize the behavior and try to make you feel like your reactions to that is wrong, that's a huge problem and it will never change. Only temporarily so. \n\nHowever, I realize there are many sides to this situation. So if you really feel that he is putting in an effort and that is enough for you, go with your gut. But don't ignore your gut here and try to convince yourself by accepting the excuses (depression, repetitive behavior, drug/alcohol abuse). Ultimately, he us responsible for himself. That doesnt mean you should be taking the brunt of his struggles through his poor commitment habits.",

            "OP I just want to point something out that I know based on experience. You've realized his behavior is related to substance abuse issues.

He's unreliable, will pass out when you are coming to meet him, etc. While I understand you want to give him the benefit of the doubt, don't allow him to excuse his poor behavior because of depression. He needs to get his drinking and smoking under control, and start acting like an adult.\n\n(Recovering addict here, can confirm)",

Also, keep in mind that this is likely his best behavior at this point. And he'll start to slack off again soon. So if the best you can get is this... wow. And I'm a little upset for you that you're now feeling like you were being emotionally manipulative in reaction to his mistreatment of you.\n\nWe don't want to be guilting, shaming, or stonewalling our partners. But if he's constantly doing stuff that is disrespectful to you, no matter how many times you ask him to change the behaviour, that's a problem.\n\nEdited to add: Okay, I read your original post. It's time to move on from this relationship. You're 28 years old. Do you want children one day? If so, don't waste more time with this guy. Don't move in with this guy. Your life will be miserable. You don't share the same values. He has a drinking problem and smokes weed, you don't, *except sometimes with him*. He's influencing you to do things that are harmful to your body, that you wouldn't be doing if he wasn't around. He doesn't value your time. He is so disrespectful that you end up so anxious that you're yelling at him. That's not fair to him and it's your responsibility, but the problem is that who he is as a person, and the way he treats you, leads you to get so anxious and upset that you're going against your values and yelling at him. Couples fight, couples occasionally raise their voices, but getting involved with a guy who has substance abuse issues and depression, and who disrespects your time from the very start, and who also lives really far away... is that really the person you want to spend your life with? What about if you had a kid with this guy? You couldn't count on him to show up on time for kid stuff, appointments... you'd be run ragged picking up his slack. Don't do it to yourself.  \n\n\nAlso, if you move in with him and he can't show up on time for work, you'll end up financially supporting him because he'll lose his job. And with you to pick up the slack, he'll have the luxury of doing that without any major consequences. Because you'll be there to work twice as hard to pay all the bills.",

            "When I first started dating my now-fiance, we had similar problems. He would say, \"I'll come over sometime in the early evening,\" (which in my mind is circa 6pm), and then would come over at 9pm. Or he would say, \"I'll be at yours in an hour,\" then 70 minutes later, I'd call him to find out where the hell he was and he'd say, \"Sorry, I'll just be 20 min,\" then would come through my door 40 min later. And wonder why I was so pissed. I also did a lot of stonewalling, because I simply didn't know what to say. \n\nAfter months and years of arguing the exact definition of \"a little while\" or whether \"I am walking to the car\" should refer to \"walking in the car\" or \"intending to walk towards the car\"...my partner was diagnosed with ADHD. And we got him medication. And OH MY GOD HE IS NOW ON TIME. When he says, \"I will be home about 6,\" he walks through the door no later than 6:05. It's a revelation. But aside from his diagnosis, he proved himself by making the effort. When we finally sat down and had the conversation of how much his behaviour hurt me, he made an effort. He tried. He started being better. \n\nI can't promise your relationship will go the way you want it to, but I don't believe your relationship is doomed. Best wishes for you both.",

He's not actually changing any behavior....he's just going to text you to tell you that he's doing the thing you've asked him not to do.\n\nI've been with guys like this too and it's so sad for me to see another person going through this. As others have said, this is really a a self esteem issue. We should all, male and female, expect our partners to, at the very least, respect us. That means respecting each other's feelings, boundaries, *time* and body. That should be the bare minimum of your expectations of your boyfriend. \n\nHe's *saying* he gets it and will change but respect and love are verbs. They're things you *do*. He's not demonstrating that he respects you, that he's accountable or reliable. You deserves better and I hope you realize that.",

Nor is understandable anger over this. \n\nThe fuck OP?  Your dude is not the victim here, but the one doing the abuse. Your complaints and feeling about his behavior are valid.

I had no problem stepping up to the plate to help her raise her child (the father wants nothing to do with my wife or his kid)\n\nTo the point, I had 2 friends that I've had since I was 16, they were both female and I had dated one of them for 4 years but we split up agreeing that we made better friends then an actual couple. Which never happens in real life apparently. Shes always been my go for advice and I made our friendship 100% transparent for my wife when we first met and never hid anything. Out of habit my friend and I still said we loved each other but more if a platonic love. We both loved our current partners and never wanted anything between each other. However after a few years this took a toll on my wife and she asked me to stop telling her that I loved her. So I explained this to my friend and she said she understood and would have no problem doing so. \n\nAnother month or so I still have 100% transparency with my wife as to make her feel comfortable. I got deployed and my friend had just had her baby and asked me if I wanted to facetime to see her. I said yes naturally happy for her and her husband. After a nice chat and meeting her new son. I got a call from my wife a few days later asking if I had talked to her kn facetime. I told her that I had and why, also telling her what we had discussed. My wife then didnt talk to me the rest of my deployment. When I got home I explained that I was sorry it hurt her feelings and wanted to make things better. She told me to never talk to her again. I tried to explain that its was just a friendship and that neither of us wanted a relationship. \n\nMy wife took it upon herself to call her and tell her that if she didnt stop talking to me forever that she would tell my friends husband that we were having an affair.\n\nShe did not tell me any of this. I quickly noticed she had blocked me on everything, including my number. I had no idea what happened so I confronted my wife and she told me that she was certain I was cheating on her and that my friend and I were having an affair. She then told me that she had called her and only asked her to not talk to me anymore. I was slightly upset but stood by her decision and held no grudge. \n\nI feel like this event led to the breakdown of everything. She started to have no trust in anything I did, constantly going through my phone, and she would constantly lock her phone, or lock herself in the bathroom talking to someone on the phone. \n\nShe started blaming her job for her unhappiness, I told her that I could pull extra hours at work if she wanted to quit to find a new one. She quickly quit her job and made no attempt to find work agajn.\n\nI was enlisted at the time. She said she hated that I was gone all the time so I offered to go reserves to be with her more. She said that would fix it. So I got a civilian job that paid decent but we had to move. \n\nThe job is stressful and I'm not very fond of being a civilian. She has now come to the conclusion that I need to get out of the military and quit my civilian job and we to move again and that's the only way she'll be happy. \n\nI feel like I've given up everything for her to be happy, I'm trying to show her the logic that there is no way for us to survive if neither of us work.\n\nI love my wife and dont want a divorce but I feel like she will never be happy and I'm not sure how to fix it. She blames everything on me and says that I'd be happier with someone else or says shes leaving again.\n\nI'm currently deployed again and the last week I was home she wouldn't talk to me or spend time with me and our daughter. She would lock herself in the bedroom all day. Then at night she would call me names and say I dont care about her and I never spend time with her. \n\nIm very confused because I'm not the best with emotions, I'm a logical man and I see no logical answer here.\n\nAny thoughts or advice would be great. Thank you!\n\nTL:DR My wife is unhappy and refuses to do anything about it. She blames all of these problems on me, yet refuses to even let me try. She is constantly going through my phone or asking me if I'm cheating. She keeps asking me to give up the things I love in an attempt to make her happy",

            "My SO has an ex-ish person whom he still talks to and clearly deeply cares for. I didn't handle this so well at first. My previous ex cheated on me repeatedly, another ex had a similar friend whom he later admitted to being in love with, so I've got some baggage there. My SO and I had some pretty heated discussions about it. Like you seem to be-- he was very understanding of my perspective and just calmly reasserted his and that I had nothing to be worried about. Initially I reacted in a way I'm not proud of but I then slept on it and resolved to lean towards trust. I trust him in a way I knew never to trust my ex. I even offered to befriend his friend myself. Because that's what healthy love is. She's important to him as a friend and I would never ask him to give up someone like that just because I feel uncomfortable jealousy. There have to be boundaries, sure, like the \"I love you\" thing is a definite no go you maybe should have figured out for yourself without being asked. But the way your girl is acting is not ok. It's abusive. I empathize with her. Anxiety, depression, jealousy, insecurity. She must feel it even more so when you're deployed. But none of that makes abuse ok. She withholds her love from you and that's a very clear manipulation tactic. Unless your SO seeks therapy I don't think there's anything else you can really do here.",

She even told you that you're not seeing her enough so to get a civilian job. She's toxic and abusive and you need to leave. If you're still interested in the military, re enlist as a full time career again, don't get stuck doing a desk job for some person who made you cut ties with a very important person in your life (your friend). I found it so selfish and immature that she refused to talk to you for the rest of your deployment because you face timed your friend's baby. Deployment is really hard and sometimes all you need is your spouse when it gets really rough out there.\n\nI also suggest finding some way to contact you friend as well to amend things and explain it was your wife's fault.\n\nA supervisor once taught me about projecting as well, it sounds like shes cheating if she's going through your phone.

            "While most users are stating that it\u2019s a likely possibility your wife is cheating on you, I want to offer a different perspective.\n\nTo me, it sounds like your wife has depression and/or bipolar disorder. The lack of motivation/enthusiasm she has for her own life/loved ones (you,  your children) could definitely be attributed to that. The sudden resignation from her career is also a sign of depression/bipolar disorder. It\u2019s not your fault at all, so please don\u2019t blame yourself! This sounds like an underlying issue regarding her mental state, and she\u2019s taking it out on you and shutting you out as a possible coping mechanism. A lot of the time, those with depression will push others away and subconsciously prevent their own happiness/well-being. \n\nAs far as trust/jealousy, that can be attributed to bipolar disorder as well. The highs, the lows, the impulsive behavior (her threatening your friend, blocking you, quitting her job) and the overall low self-esteem. I understand why she\u2019s on edge regarding your friend that you previously had a LTR with. The sheer fact alone that you shared intimacy with that friend and had a serious relationship with her, would make a majority of partners concerned. Also, please don\u2019t tell an ex you \u201clove them\u201d, IMO, that\u2019s unnecessary and will of course make your partner uneasy, even if the friendship is strictly platonic.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t by any means excuse her behavior towards you and your friend, it just offers a different possibility of why she may have acted out in these ways. If you\u2019re wanting to mend your relationship, I would suggest having a discussion with your wife and bring up seeing a psychiatrist/psychologist to address her possible mental disorders. \n\nAlso, out of curiosity, do you know why her previous marriage failed? That could offer a *huge* explanation as well if she was cheated on or experienced a similar situation regarding her last partner having female friends that were, well, *more* than friends.\n\nGood luck OP, and regardless of anyone\u2019s opinions, do what is best for **YOU**.",

            "A lot of people are saying your wife is being unreasonable. Or abusive. Or must be cheating since she was worried you were.\n\nIn a different take, I don't see her as unreasonable. Is she reacting well? Is she being as mature as a person can be? No.\n\nBut her reactions aren't irrational or unreasonable.\n\nShe has problems with you being close friends with an ex-girlfriend who you continued to say \"I love you\" to after you were married.\n\nNormal.\n\nShe found out that she's really not okay with being a military wife, left at home while her husband is deployed, and has discovered that this makes her unhappy.\n\nNormal.\n\nWhat she IS doing is struggling to properly work through this, with you, in a constructive way. Which I suppose leaves that to you, if you want to save the relationship.\n\nFirst, recognise that any relationship with an ex is going to be a minefield with your current partner. Your wife shouldn't have to tell you that saying \"I love you\" to a former longterm girlfriend makes her uncomfortable. Have a brain.\n\nSecond, recognise that being a military wife is hard. Long distance relationships are hard. Relationships with people who travel a lot for work are hard. And relationships where your partner puts themselves in harm's way are hard.\n\nFinally, people don't always sufficiently anticipate the toll these things take on them. They might say \"this is fine\" at first, but it's not that easy.\n\nNone of this requires you to be 'the best with emotions'. This is all logical.\n\nSo when she tells you that your continuing relationship with her ex makes her uncomfortable, or that your continued involvement in the military is something that keeps her from finding happiness with you ... treat that as a statement of fact. Not an emotional reaction. These are normal things that you might find with any number of potential partners.\n\nThat all said, it sounds like she doesn't deal with these emotions constructively and instead expresses them in harmful ways. This is unhelpful, but not necessarily that abnormal. You're both young, and your wife appears to have entered her second marriage at 21 ... diving into commitment fast and then regretting it seems to be a pattern.\n\nWhile it feels like a tired answer, both you and your wife need therapy to get through this (either together or alone). Neither of you seem to be making an attempt to understand what makes each other tick, or trying to build a life that makes each other happy.\n\n(I know you say you are, but seriously dude. You had to be told that saying \"I love you\" to an ex was not okay? You managed to do this regularly for a few years without noticing that it made your wife uncomfortable?

Trust goes 2 ways and if one side can't keep up, the other falls apart as well.\n\nMy husband and I went through something similar over the past couple of years.  I have never and have no intention of ever cheating on him at any level in any form.  I'll forgo the very long story and keep only the relevant.  \n\nHe had never been jealous, until this one kid came around.  He was half my age, struggling with addiction and already in legal trouble.  We became quite close.  In spite of the age difference, we were good friends and had a good time together.  But there was also a parental component as well as a spiritual one.  \n\nFast forward, my husband decided he didn't really like it.  He waited months until he said so, letting it swirl in his head to all sorts of potential scenarios.  We went back & forth for a year.  I should have just cut the kid off and leave him to the world, but I just couldn't.  I backed off a bit, a bit more, a bit more...  I was also completely transparent.  We were never alone. At least my kids were around.  They enjoyed him.  He was basically a kid.  I let my husband see everything and he was never excluded.   But the fact is, he had already decided and I soon realized there was nothing that would change his outlook.  He never flat out accused me of cheating and said he didn't believe I had or would.  But it didn't matter.  He didn't trust me and he didn't make the effort to try.  \n\nMany months later, things are status quo.  We are going about our lives, out of sight out of mind.  But there is tension in our home and our marriage.  He showed me that he didn't trust me.  That he thought I was capable of things that go against who I am.  Nothing I have ever done in the past or the present would have given indication this was something I could do.  But that he saw me that way hurt me so bad.  I was acutely aware of everything I did, concerned that he would read something into it.  I felt like a grounded teenager.  Because he clearly didn't even know who I am put a wedge between us and made me lose trust in him.  I didn't trust him not to assume or spy or snoop.  I'm resentful towards him.  He took something good that I was trying to do (which he's seen me do plenty of times.  This is not the first broken person I've taken under my wing.) and turned it into something sinister.  \n\nI'll encourage you to consider how you feel about your wife now.  Will you forever resent her for what she's doing now?  Will you ever be comfortable believing that she trusts you, or will you constantly be looking over your shoulder wondering what she's thinking and what she's probably convincing herself?  Do you want to defend everything you do forever?  Because even if she never brings it up again, you might.",
            "I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been said everywhere else - but it doesn\u2019t seem like this relationship is healthy or working out for either of you, OP. \n\nI was once the type of partner who was overly paranoid about my bf having female friends because of my insecurity. I wrongfully had a previous partner get rid of his female friends because of *me*. I forced him to conform to my ideas of happiness simply because I was scared of losing him and because I saw everyone as potential competition. Including his friends.\n\nAfter our break up, it was very clear that I was emotionally and mentally abusive. I couldn\u2019t even begin to understand what he went through. But I know I am sorry for it and that I would never want anyone to go through that again. And I will never really know how he felt throughout the relationship since we were both very bad at communicating our own feelings and being open. \n\nMy best advice probably isn\u2019t what you want. I would say you two need to certainly have a sit down conversation about your boundaries and about the fact that she simply doesn\u2019t trust you.

I don't care how platonically you ended it you were together for 4 years. The fact that that was even a thing that you thought was okay is so weird to me. She thinks you're cheating. She's completely convinced that you're cheating on her so she's cutting you off emotionally so that she can leave you. I can almost guarantee that she's looking for employment and maybe even her own place which might be why her phone is locked. I would have assumed that you were cheating too. There's more then just physical cheating there's emotional cheating too. She found the Skype call and I'm going to guess she found something else that leads her to believe you're cheating while you were deployed. Emails, texts, or if she doesn't have access to your Skype while you were deployed then someone is telling her that something happened on that Skype call and that's why she asked if you two Skyped. Someone is telling her you're cheating and someone told her that something happened on that Skype call. Maybe instead of coming to Reddit go to counseling. Because I've been with cheaters they generally don't see anything wrong with their behavior. And I've been with a man who's ex wife was still actively in love with him. His ex wife did everything she could to make me believe he was cheating on me with her while feigning innocence to him.  I.E. sending me messages between them out of context, or telling me they just got off a 2 hour phone call where he professed his love to her and when I checked his call logs there was a 2 hour phone call and I couldn't bring myself to believe anything he said about what happened on said phone call or anything about their relationship that he told me.

Apologies for that! \n\n- Ask yourself this: \u2018what would I say to my friend if she confided in me that her husband was treating her the exact way my wife treats me?\u2019 You might find it\u2019s easier to accept truths when you take this perspective. \n- I\u2019ve also noticed throughout this thread that you\u2019ve mentioned she acknowledges her insecurities. Remember. acknowledging is half the battle, but doing something to change it is the other half. Don\u2019t simply take \u2018it\u2019s okay, she knows she\u2019s got these issues\u2019 as enough. It isn\u2019t an excuse for behaviour. \n- Something pretty confronting I heard quite recently (confronting because it made me question how I approach certain situations) \u201cif the behaviour has been accepted, people will continue to behave that way\u201d in other words, if you\u2019ve accepted her controlling, manipulative, insecure and jealous behaviours she knows she can get away with it and will continue this behaviour. This means that same way, some how you have to help her see that the way she treats you is unacceptable. I can understand that this may be the hardest thing you\u2019ll have to do if she constantly has a victim mindset, but your choices are to continue to accept behaviour in order to not \u2018poke the beast\u2019 or expect change and go with the flow whatever that may look like. \n- on victim mindsets, it sounds like she\u2019s had some things happen to her in her life that are pretty crappy. Even if she has BPD, this is an illness so firmly based on environmental factors. She needs to work on herself the most in order to learn how to be happy. Her happiness as her husband is partially your responsibility but in large part, it falls on her and what she\u2019s willing to do to seek help for the things that she might have experienced. But this part isn\u2019t your responsibility, your responsibility is to work on you. \nI actually feel for her in a way. If she can recognise that she isn\u2019t content right now and hasn\u2019t been for a long time, she must be feeling as though she\u2019ll never be content and in that way, she\u2019s searching hard for something to make her happy. This may come out by way of cheating, asking you to move heaven and earth and sacrifice everything in between, even self-sabotage because she just simply doesn\u2019t know how to be happy.

Your wife is insecure and also very clearly depressed (often those go together). I hope she gets help and you two can stay together, but you can\u2019t fix her. That\u2019s her job and hers alone. I know this because I spent many years doing the hard work to heal from depression and suicidal ideations. Best of luck to both of you.",
            "She's emotionally abusive. You need to give her the bottom line, get help and counseling both together and both individually or you leave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt also sounds as if she may be the one having an affair, talking on the phone and hiding while doing so. People that cheat tend to project that same action on their partner as a way to justify why they are doing it.",
            "It's not a fair relationship. You should not have to give up things (or friends) every time you turn around to please your partner. Unless, those people or things are a serious detriment to you or your family, which it doesn't sound like any were, there was no reason for this. Tbh, it sounds like she wanted you to basically live for her and whatever made her happy. That's not how a relationship works. Sure, you try to make your partner happy, but there's a limit; you can't **be** someone else's happiness. I'm not sure if she has some mental issue or what is going on, but you shouldn't have to continue to live like this and she sounds abusive. \n\nShe needs to get help or you leave. It's that simple. And if she continually drags her feet or refuses, you leave. It may hurt, but sometimes, if someone isn't treating you right and you let them know once or multiple times (in my past case), then you just have to let go. Maybe they'll get help or maybe they won't, but that's up to them and you need to be free to live your life without all the stress or having someone calling you names when you're trying to please them. You've done more than a lot of partners would do. Also, just a tip, try to get better at emotions. I know it's hard, but it will do wonders with communication whether you stay with her or find someone else. Good luck! I hope things turn out well for you.",
            "You are The Giving Tree, OP. Google and read. I hope it wakes you up. Don't give up on being you. She's going to  destroy you, if she hasn't already. And I say that  because her level of happiness is higher on your radar than your own, which shouldn't be. You don't allow a partner to cut you down and prevent you from growing and enjoying relationships with other humans without consequence. The consequence should be that they lose  access to impede your life, otherwise you will be old and alone and do nothing all day but answer, \"yes, dear\", and hang your head in shame as everyone in earshot stares at your whipped ass. You're fighting an impenetrable wall with dodgeballs. You're choice is stay or go. You choose the life you want, not her, but make one thing clear, the life you want will not be the one you get if you stick around for any more of this bullshit.\n\nPS: There's a reason almost 500 people are here posting.\n\nPps oh I forgot, it's obvious she is cheating it makes it easier.\n\ntl;dr: stop being this b's yes man.",

She is the only one who can bring happiness in to her life.\n\nI have gone through your exact situation and people who complain about something but never attempt to fix the problem WILL ALWAYS BE UNHAPPY.\n\nYou will end up hating yourself and constantly feeling like a failure. \n\nIT IS NOT YOUR FAULT. At the end of the day you have to believe you gave 100% and be proud of that.",
            "I've been through something similar with my partner. All I can say is life is far from perfect.\nNo one really knows what they want and the best we can do is be there for one another.\nYour wife seems like she has a lot of insecurities and they may come from her own feelings. Maybe she wants to cheat. Maybe not. Maybe shes just trying to find a way to make things work.\nI mean look at it from her point of view for a second. You say I love you to your best friend who also happens to be an ex lover. Not even the most secure person could deal with something like that.\nBut the problem with this situation is that. Yes you stopped talking to your ex and stopped contacting her. But this is something you need to want as well otherwise its pointless.\nYou will grow resentful, like it seems you are.\nYou wife will feel this resentment. Even if you dont think you are.\nWhat it boils down to is how you feel. Because this is your life and only you can fix your life. You cant change your wife but you can try make her understand how you feel and maybe try understand how she feels no matter how irrational she is being.\nIf you cant do this then maybe you shouldn't be with her.\n\nGood luck and I hope life works out for you and your wife.",

I know it\u2019s not a healthy solution but I\u2019ll bet good money she\u2019s doing something she shouldn\u2019t.

For your own sake and mental health, and for hers. She can't deal with a relationship. She needs help. Medical help.

You sound like a loving husband and that you know what it means to make compromises you don't like for the greater picture of a relationship and know that it takes work to make a marriage successful. However, based on the actions she has displayed, she is not respecting you and herself as well. Her own baggage should not be projected onto you and should be solved before ever beginning a relationship with you.\n\nI understand divorce is not the path you want to take, so I'll recommend sitting her down and explaining that you are no longer happy being in this relationship and that you don't know how much longer you can take it. Try to talk to her with why is she is unhappy. Suggest solutions such as having dedicated self time, meet with some old friends you haven't seen in a while for coffee and go without her, take small steps to build trust. Perhaps her love language is quality time and she simply wants your undivided attention for only 30 mins a day. Additionally, identify what are actions/behaviors she can do that will give you happiness in your relationship again.\n\nHope this helps \ud83d\ude4f",

She needs therapy and the realization that she can't be the center of everything, and you need to leave and find someone that is comfortable with you and doesn't distrust you.\n\n Also, you should get back in touch with your friend.

As you have seen, every time that you change one thing for her, she simply moves the goal posts to something else. I am certain that if you go through with this move she is demanding, she still will not be happy and will simply find something else to complain about once it's over. She's just fundamentally unhappy right now and she needs to stop looking outside for fulfillment and learn how to self-regulate and cope. Her moods, her emotions and her perspective are influenced first and foremost by her and if she's chronically unhappy then she needs to go to therapy, get a hobby or figure out something. But she can't just keep making you the scapegoat for all her feelings.\n\n> My wife then didnt talk to me the rest of my deployment.  \n\nYour wife's first reaction to conflict is to punish you instead of try to find a resolution. That is not how spouse's should interact with one another. The way to solve things like this is via communication and compromise, not by withholding affection. You are the one trying to talk, you are the one trying to compromise, you are the one trying to work things out. She lashes out and behaves harmfully when she gets upset, even over perceived wrongs that didn't actually happen. \n\n> My wife took it upon herself to call her and tell her that if she didnt stop talking to me forever that she would tell my friends husband that we were having an affair.\n\nYour wife went behind your back, ended a friendship you had with someone very near and dear to you. And not only that, but she threatened to ruin your good friend's (who was a new mother!) marriage, over something that wasn't even true. And then she told you a watered down version of the story so you wouldn't find out how far she had gone. \n\nIf your friend had refused, your wife could have literally destroyed your friend's entire marriage right after she had a baby. And based on what? A completely untrue and petty suspicion that she had. That is not normal behavior, that is serious. \n\nYour wife is acting in a manner that is controlling and emotionally abusive. If her behavior does not stop, you need to get out. This is harmful. \n\n> I feel like she will never be happy and I'm not sure how to fix it \n\nYou can't fix it because it's not your fault. You are just being used as her emotional punching bag. You take all the blame and make all the sacrifices while she continues to perceive that the entire world is out to get her. Healthy relationships involve give and take from both people involved, and in your relationship, you are doing all of the giving and she is doing all the taking. That is unbalanced and unhealthy. \n\nAnd yes, while ultimately she is responsible for starting to be a more giving, compromising and reasonable partner, it is well within your control to stop giving in to her every demand and start having some expectations of respectful treatment towards yourself as well. You deserve better than this.",

Healthy relationships are based in trust and wanting what is best for the other person. \n\nYou will never do enough to make her happy, because the cause of her unhappiness is inside her. She's made her problems yours and it's not fair or right, because you can't actually control her emotions or insecurities. Only she can.\n\nYou can't fix this. It's not about you it's about her.

You still sound annoyed that she even asked you to stop, even though you did it. Maybe it would be good to reflect on why you would still resent that she set this boundary.\n\nFor her requests for you to change things about your life - you don't have to say yes. There isn't a lot written here that indicates she is being controlling, just that she has unreasonable demands, the emotional source of which is unknown from this post.

I understand where the wife is coming from (jealousy), but she needs to work on this and not you.\n3. Your wife is never going to be happy because she's an Abusive/Narcissistic type that uses manipulation.  She needs help. She either was previously in a relationship where she was cheated on and is reflecting that fear on you, or she is just overtly fearful of it for a reason. Low-self esteem.\n4. 4. I would not be surprised, if out of her own emotions and not yours, she herself does have an affair. Even if an emotional one online.\n5. If you do believe in trying to save your marriage, couple's therapy is there. But make no mistake, the majority of people that embark in this type of behavior in a marriage end with divorce. So I wish you the best of luck but consider, that this may end up resulting in a divorce between the both of you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is time for the both of you to go to couple's therapy.

            "This is abuse and she is trying to isolate you. It's best you reach back out to your friends and family. Tell them what is happening and find some support getting out of there. Nothing will ever be good enough for her so you might as well stop trying and let her go.",
            "When you come back from your deployment id suggest having a real discussion with her ex to see what happened to their marriage from his view. With how shes acting it may have been she treated him the same way and thats part of the reason the marriage failed. If she was willing to threaten to ruin your friend's life with such a heinous lie there are probably other things she's done that are big red flags. You've sacrificed your friend your career for her, and she still wants you to keep sacrificing to make her happy? She will never be happy and you need to stop cannibalizing your goals for her. Also check your phone billal and either call or text the number she seems to be calling when shes alone to see who it is. \n\nIf she keeps saying its all you and your the one that needs to change but unwilling to admit to and change her own behavior you need to leave. Good luck and thanks for your service.",
            "Basically she's not happy. And you can never make her happy enough. If you think she's cheating get evidence. Take her to court in divorce her. If you're truly not happy leave the marriage. You gave up everything for her and she's not happy. Stop doing it. You need to focus on yourself.",
            "Take your daughter and get out. She clearly doesn't love you and is abusing you. If she locks herself in her room, calls you name and says you never spend time with her, doesn't speak to you, and goes through your phone; that is a definite sign of abuse. Your wife needs therapy and you need to divorce her.",
            "constantly saying you are cheating on her is a BIG red flag for cheating on you. Try to check her phone and maybe remember the patron/pincode. Also, she sounds like an r/nicegirls type.",
            "Dude, I am so sorry, but her acting like that and talking with people specifically away from you makes it sound like she met Jodie. I really hope I\u2019m wrong",
            "This sounds like she is suffering from severe form of depression, the best choice would probably be to take her to the doctor, and talk to her about that. This is a pretty serious condition, and shouldn't be treated lightly.\n\nThe person who suffers from it likely won't be able to escape from it by themselves, simply because they don't have a will to do anything, or even a will to live, so she really needs your support.\n\nI suggest taking her to psychiatrist, and maybe to family psychologist, to talk about your issues.\n\nIf you don't really love her, and just got used to her, then maybe breaking up is an answer, but I don't think this is the best solution for the problem, especially since you have a child.",
            "I don't know if you will see this comment since this post is 12 days old as I post this comment, but out of curiosity how is the kid taking all of this? (Be aware I don't know how old the kid is so I don't even know if they can comprehend what is going on.)",
            "I've read some comments so far and some people jump to not too far fetched conclusions, but before you go that to that length step back an view things in a way that suits you the best, logicaly and obejctive. Ask yourself if you are happy with the overall situation, what bothers you and what you want to be changed so it is a good relashionship for you again. See if there are thing you can do to get these changes into motion talk to your wife and adivse her some professional help, she sounds from what you said like she has some for of mental illness like depressions, further try to get professional relashionship advice/help if you still desire to stay with her. You are not to blame in any form and should stand for your own rights to stay in contact with friends but right now may not be a good time to state that, at least if you didn't already decide to leave her and want to stay with her. If she get's more stable you may be able to talk about past things and you \"former\" friendship and maybe be able to get back into contact with her, which would benefit you, because humans are still in need of social contacts.\n\nEdit: I should cover the other side, too. This is not a relashionship that is healthy at the moment neither for you, her or your daughter, if things won't change and/or other things like cheating may come to light you should take your leave as soons as possible and try to get to daughter to live with you (reason for that is that i am quite positve that she is in an mentally unstable state).",
            "I'm no expert but I would try to take the kid (legal custody), tell her off, then leave her. If she comes back tell her off again, and slam the door in her face.",
            "To me the options are: get relationship counselling if you want to save things or get a divorce.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have to say that if someone interfered with a friendship like that, I would never forgive that.",
            "**Don't be afraid for divorce. She is actively making your life worse, not making it better at all. This isn't a relationship. 50% of marriages end in divorce. And it seems that this friend was really close to you, not worth it.**",
            "**And if it IS because of a mental disorder, you have no responsibility to be in a relationship with someone that's treating you badly. You don't need to give up your life for a bad person.**",
            "**Also, doesn't seem like counseling would fix anything. She's toxic, and is trying to get rid of all the things you love, and doesn't want to listen or even fix the problem.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**It seems like she actually WANTS to have things to yell at you about.**",
            "Your wife cares nothing about your happiness dude. It should be very clear to you that your wife is very troubled and you should divorce and move on",
            "Even though you don't want to divorce you should you're in a toxic relationship that will only get worse and it's not only damaging you it can hurt your daughter too",
            "im sorry im just seeing this but you kinda need to escape.....\n\nThis relationship is toxic and if she cant appriciate how your helping her out so much already and is super greedy and stuff you need to leave. She is being controlling and you need to rebel or leave. cannot stress out enough. get your friend back in touch aswell.",
            "your wife might've been cheating on you while you were deployed",
            "grootis, you need to leave your wife, she's a jealous person, who's probably cheated on you. Make amends with your friend and find someone better. She doesn't deserve you and you deserve better.",

Link below:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6f7yz5/my\\_f26\\_sister\\_f23\\_keeps\\_posting\\_personal\\_details/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6f7yz5/my_f26_sister_f23_keeps_posting_personal_details/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter reading through everyone's responses and taking time for myself to see how I really felt about the whole situation, I did as I said I was going to do, and blocked my sister on all forms of social media. I also cut her out of my life (albeit, temporarily). For about 8 months, I didn't speak to her, nor make any attempts at communicating with her.  That summer (so about 2 months after I had stopped contact with her), my sister moved away for school. My mother eventually got wind of the situation from my brother (who was 24 at the time and has never been particularly close with our younger sister) and asked me why I wasn't talking to my sister.\n\nInitially she was judgmental, but after explaining to her my sisters repeated behavior of posting personal details about me online (including my phone number and details about my sex life), my mother was furious and agreed that I had every right to cut her out of my life. At one point, my mother, during a phone conversation with my sister, called her out, calling my sister childish, petty, and vindictive and said that if she ever found out that she was posting any intimate details about ANY family members online like that again, she wouldn't hesitate to find a lawyer. She also threatened to kick my sister out of the house if she didn't stop her nonsense (while she was away at school, she did live at my mom's house during summer breaks/holidays).  I'm not sure if there was any actual legal repercussions my mom could have actually made against her, but it was enough to make my sister set her blog/twitter to private after my mom browbeat her into submission for being so shitty.  Due to this, my sister and my mom had a huge falling out as well, with my sister repeating the same old adage of how it was her \"personal\" blog/twitter so she could do whatever she wanted with it/on it.\n\nChristmas rolled around and me and sister still weren't talking, and while my mom had patched things up with her to a degree, it was an awkward holiday. Me and my brother both live independently. When we went over to visit for holiday stuff, were civil and polite towards our sister, but we never failed to notice her on her phone 24/7. We could only speculate what she was doing, but I was less bothered now that she had set her blogs to private. Regardless, during a dinner at one point, she was on her phone and my mom asked her to put her phone down so we could have \"family\" time. She responded along the lines of \"yeah, one minute\", and my brother made a jab about how she was probably too busy posting \"bullshit lies\" about us on the internet. I should mention that while my sister doesn't seem to care what I think/ask of her, she has always seemed to respond and care about what my brother thinks. She tried to fight him on his comment for a minute, but he shut her down, calling her \"a fucking child\" who just wants \"internet points\" and straight up said that if she was \" a decent fucking human being\" she would talk to us about her problems instead of cowering behind a screen.  She shut up after that and retreated to her room after dinner was done.\n\nAfter Christmas, I continued to have zero contact with her. I would hear about how she was doing in school via our mom from time to time, but still had her blocked on all social media. She came home for the summer to work, and that summer our Grandma (my deceased father's mother ) died. My sister ended up having a complete breakdown due to the culminating and unworked through grief surrounding our father (who had died 2 years previous) and now our Grandma. She started going to therapy and actually taking her medication.\n\nEventually, she reached out and apologized to me about her behavior the past few years. We had a sit down that fall, over some beers and talked about everything that had happened and her behavior. I told her while I accepted her apology, it would take some time for me to work through her how behavior had affected me and our relationship. I unblocked her on FB so we could make a group chat with our brother as a buffer. We now occasionally talk, but we still aren't as close as we used to be when we were younger. I actually went to lunch with her the last time she was in town and it felt...okay. So that's it, here we are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nBlocked my sister on all forms of social media and cut contact, only participating in it during holiday events/funerals. Brother and mother supported my decision and made it clear to her they didn't stand for her behavior. Sister ended up going to therapy and actually taking her medication and later apologized. We occasionally talk now, but we aren't close anymore.",

            "Ugh, I have a sister who would take pictures of me at events (like meeting an Instagram famous dog) off my personal Facebook page and would tweet them to celebrities that she regularly tweets at. It annoyed me so much. FWIW, I don't post on Facebook anymore nor talk to that sister anymore (due to other drama), but that shouldn't stop you from posting on Facebook.\n\nAnyways, my sister also has a blog for books she writes (that sadly nobody reads except her circle of book friends), and she talks a lot about her personal life and her relationships with her sisters. It drives me crazy, and I hate when you google search my name, you can find her blog where I'm talked about.",
            "Unfortunately these things take time. While I'm glad that you guys have opened the door to reconciliation, it sadly won't happen automatically. You both have to make the effort as well. I'm rooting for you!",
            "She might not like it, but you need to keep verifying that she is not breaking your boundaries for a long, long time.  Even if she has stopped, if she breaks down again, she could start up again.",
            "I am glad for you that you made some headway with her. It does take time. It sounds like her age + unresolved grief about your father + internet points got her doing some seriously damaging things. Good luck to you all. \n\nAlso, your mother is a BOSS.",
            "This reminds me of a story a while back about a mummy blogger who posts everything about her kid's life under her real name, being asked to stop by the kid (who I think was about 10 or 11?) because classmates could find it. If people absolutely MUST write about every detail of their life and relationships online then at least use a fake name because it's not fair on everyone else involved to have their dirty laundry aired out like that.",
            ">\tShe started going to therapy and actually taking her medication.\nEventually, she reached out and apologized to me about her behavior the past few years. We had a sit down that fall, over some beers\n\nAll due respect, but if she\u2019s on medication for mental health, please try to encourage her sobriety from alcohol as well. Society seems to downplay how powerful of a drug alcohol is. I can\u2019t tell you how much my depression and anxiety decreased a few months after I stopped drinking regularly. \n\nThis Naked Mind is a book that has a wonderful chapter on this.\n \nGlad to hear your family is all working through this, and my condolences on your losses of loved ones.",
            "I\u2019m glad she saw how bad her behavior was. I use to have friends that acted just like her and defended their negativity and abuse with \u201cit\u2019s my personal blog!\u201d and it would make me feel like I was constantly walking on eggshells.",
            "I recently started speaking to my older sister again, like yesterday. First time speaking to her and seeing her in over 2 years. Over different issues than yours, but if you have any advice for me that would be cool. It\u2019s awkward and I almost don\u2019t want to message her because of that. Still a lot of bad feelings towards her, but I\u2019m trying. We use to be EXTREMELY close. She called me every single day on her lunch breaks. I\u2019ve missed her dearly. I hate holding this grudge.",
            "I hope overtime you start to become a family again and we all make mistakes, I would have done the exact same thing and I think you handled it well, its a shame that it took deaths to sort issues out but im sure your dad and grandma would want you guys to patch things up and start to become a unit again, this may not happen it may do it will take time and it depends on the person, hopefully she will learn but you have your life to live so live it.",
            "You should buy her a diary/journal for Chrismas to write all her feelings in",
            "I feel kind of bad for your sister. As insufferable as she was, and as wrong as her behavior was, it sounds like your family doesn't have the best communication style and there's a reason she felt she couldn't talk to you guys. Does your brother always talk to her like that?   \n\n\nTo be clear, she was 100% wrong and you were well within your rights to cut off contact with her, I'm just curious about the family dynamics.",
            "I\u2019m happy for you OP",
            "I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve started having a relationship again. What she did is obviously highly inappropriate, but I\u2019d also guess all the need for outward sharing and validation means she had quite some issues to work through. I hope you can build on this new start and build a new relationship over time",
            "I always had my personal blog set to private when I was 13... 20 years ago? Yeah? Needed support due to trauma at home, but I kept real names out and it was password locked up tight.\n\nI would understand if my crappy parents didn't like me posting publically because it would shame them and it's not anyone else's business but I needed support somewhere.\n\nI lived in a small town, no public transit, not easy to get therapy without them knowing so blogging and forums was the only way for myself to survive it. I was lucky to have the outlet.\n\nBut publically yeah, I totally get it. Even from my point of view.",
            "You'll be sisters the rest of your life. Having a relationship is optional, and having a *close* relationship will, as you're perfectly aware, take time and effort on both your parts.\n\nI hope your sister is more aware of and sensitive to how risky it is posting personal info online, particularly after the last couple of years. Not even related to your personal preferences, the way public life is going these days, *everything ever posted* not just by but also *about* someone, whether true or not, can be dug up and used against them, and it isn't just politicians and celebrities who can be victims.\n\nIt sounds like she is maturing, though, and owning up to her responsibility. I hope in time you *do* become closer again, if that's what you want.\n\nGood luck to you both!",
            "Did she delete the posts about you?",
            "I'm glad the rest of your family are good people and take no shit from the sister. Props to brother for putting her ass in its place so eloquently, lol.",
            "I'm just wondering but when you told your mom she tweeted \"details about your sex life\" and you mom freaked out..were the tweets stuff like \n\n>Sis and her boyfriend are loudly fucking in the other room again"
