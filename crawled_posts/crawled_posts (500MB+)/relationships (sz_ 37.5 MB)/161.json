        "selftext": "My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years. Our relationship is strong except for a recurring issue where her family is... difficult and she is not always great at standing up to them/for me. I am a large man; not fat or anything, just very tall. I play 2 recreational sports and also bike a lot in my free time. As a result of this, I eat quite a lot. 95% of the time, I eat healthy but in larger quantities, and the other 5% of them time I will occasionally pig out. I am not unhealthy in the slightest; I have been to a doctor recently and he affirmed I am in good health and have a good healthy lifestyle by all measures (weight, exercise, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.). So I know I am doing everything right. However, my girlfriend's family constantly needs to comment on what and how much I eat.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThey live 2 hours away so when we see them, it is typically us staying at their house for a whole weekend where I am at the whims of whatever the menu is. If I eat more than one serving of something, then the Mom or Sister will make comments or whisper to each other about how I am eating into their leftovers the next day, or how it's unhealthy for me to have a second cookie or something. This is even if there is a ton of food, so I know I'm not eating their whole week's budget of food or anything. I have also tried bringing my own snacks so I am not infringing on their supply of food with my extra eating, but this doesn't work either. I will sneak a granola bar or an apple or a bag of chips from my bag and they will find out (I think they search the trash or something) and let me know that it will spoil my appetite, or ask whether the food Mom made wasn't good enough for me. My GF and I also will do our own activities out of the house during the day sometimes when we visit, so I have occasionally had us stop at a fast food place if I need to eat some fries or chicken nuggets or whatever out of the house. Whenever we come back, the Mom or Sister will make comments or ask if we ate anywhere else while we were out, and GF gets nervous and confesses because she feels guilty or doesn't like lying to them. So after 3 years of this, I get really sick of being attacked for the amount I eat even when it barely impacts them and I know I'm eating an ok amount. It has gradually gotten worse over time.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMy breaking point came last week when it was GF's mom's birthday so we met at a restaurant in the middle between us one night. I ordered a burger and fries while everyone else ordered salads. And immediately, GF's mom, sister, and aunt all started commenting about how the burger looked unhealthy. I stood up for myself and said that I had biked dozens of miles that week already so I think I can treat myself to a burger, to which the sister said that one unhealthy thing can wipe out weeks of working out, which I dismissed. I was hoping that would be it, but every like 10 minutes someone would make more comments. So I'm getting really annoyed. I eyeballed my GF numerous times to be like \"back me up here\" and barely got anything. Finally, the food came and my burger was perfectly normal. Not giant, not dripping with grease, not filled with unhealthy toppings. Just a normal burger. But everyone was like \"wow that thing is enormous! You really shouldn't eat that in one sitting, it'll clog your arteries and you will feel terrible afterwards. Seriously, that thing is so unhealthy, I think I would die immediately.\" I decided that I was done after that. I sneaked away to the bathroom and stopped at the front of the restaurant to ask for a box and to pay my part of the bill early, came back to the table, and announced that I was going to get going as I didn't feel well and asked my GF if she wanted a ride home or if she was going to figure out another way home. She got super embarrassed and said that she would come with me if I wait a few minutes, so I got in the car and ate my burger in there while I waited like 10 mins for her to come. We left and she cried the whole way home. I felt bad that it hurt her feelings but I'm at my limit and I told her I was done going to events where we eat food with her family, and if that means that I don't come with her when she visits her family then that's just the way it has to be. I said I would be skipping Thanksgiving at her parents' this year.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSince then, she has barely talked to me but hasn't really fought me on it at all. I know it hurts her but I have to stick up for myself here. I'm sick of being treated like I'm some fatso who eats like garbage when I know I live a healthier lifestyle than any of them. I'm not even that mad at my girlfriend. Obviously I would appreciate the backup but I know she's scared of her family since they are all kind of bullies, so I'm just not going to allow myself to be present at these opportunities. Whatever fallout happens as a result of this is just not my responsibility. Am I handling this right? Is there a nicer way I could have said everything or been gentler with my girlfriend? I don't want to hurt her feelings but I have the right to protect myself if she won't.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \ntl;dr - I eat a lot because I am tall and active. GF's family make a lot of comments about how much I eat, to an insane degree. I got fed up and have announced that I am not going to any events where we eat, including Thanksgiving.",

            "You have not done anything wrong here, but instead of defending yourself by saying things like \u201cI eat healthy, I exercise\u201d etc., could you just flat out set a boundary and say \u201cplease stop commenting on my food, I am an adult and choose what I eat\u201d? Or something like that? \n\nAlso, your girlfriend seems to be responding super passively here. It doesn\u2019t sound like y\u2019all have fully talked it through if she\u2019s just saying things like \u201cok\u201d or \u201cI understand.\u201d Y\u2019all should be talking about things like her own experience with her family, her relationship with food with her family, how does she feel setting boundaries with them and what will it take for her to do that, how it makes you feel and what will happen if they don\u2019t stop, etc. I think your girlfriend needs therapy and definitely couples therapy if y\u2019all plan to stay together.",
            "Honestly sounds like the family is projecting some disordered eating habits. Obviously still not fair to you but",
            "Is this how you want to live the rest of your life?  What happens if you have a baby and they start shaming a pregnant woman for eating a healthy amount of food?  What happens when they shame your child into having an eating disorder?  Your girlfriend is perfectly fine with them treating you this way so it is only going to get worse.",
            "They sound extremely petty and I'm assuming envious, and I wouldn't want to be around them either.",
            "Even if you were morbidly obese this would be the worst way for them to express concern. You handled it pretty well and are setting a reasonable boundary. Don't feel bad about it.",
            "This is an eating disorder. Your girlfriend\u2019s family, and possibly even her if she was raised that way, have eating disorders.\n\nIt is not normal to tell a grown man they can\u2019t eat a granola bar or have seconds or to GO THROUGH THE TRASH to try and catch someone eating.  \n\nThe restaurant situation where everyone ordered salads and commented on your burger is very telling. All three of them commenting is abnormal.\n\nI would bet money they are commenting to make you feel guilty because they secretly want that burger and are jealous that you get to have it. \n\nUltimately you have a girlfriend problem. She needs to fix her family and if not then NEITHER of you should be visiting. Respecting her partner is the bare minimum on her end and theirs.",
            "Have you had the hard discussion where you ask her to find a therapist and start working through the clear food-related family trauma she\u2019s carrying around? \n\nShe\u2019s never going to defend you from them until she does a hell of a lot of work. She\u2019s not at fault here, she just probably never knew till you arrived that their behavior was fucked up. But now that you\u2019ve told her, she either has to do the work or you need to walk.",
            "Have you clearly explained to your gf how this makes you feel and asked her to tell them to stop? Not just funny looks or leaving. \n\nHave you told the family that their comments are rude?",
            ">I'm not even that mad at my girlfriend.\n\nYou should be. She's the one who has been allowing them to treat you this way.",
            "Does this entire family have an eating disorder? What is happening??",
            "The issue is her family are bullies but also they all seem to be suffering from eating disorders. They\u2019re not concerned about nutrition or money. They\u2019re obsessed with quantity. Your gf, can\u2019t stand up to them because of the bullying but also most likely that growing up in that environment she has also absorbed some of those extreme and distorted perceptions. Above all, there\u2019s a lot of shame involved. \n\nDon\u2019t go to the family events but go a step further and speak to your gf about getting some professional help to deal with all these issues.",
            "Have you asked yourself, her, or the family what exactly the intent is? Is it to embarrass you? Is it to pick on you? Is it because they genuinely care? Something else?",
            "My sister went on holiday with a family like this once. On the first morning they had plain bread rolls for breakfast... but they cut them all in half, so everyone only had half a roll for breakfast. \n\nMy sister couldn't believe how little they ate... but some people just need very little food to get by, and some need a lot. When she got home she just couldn't stop eating.",
            "Who the fuck goes out to dinner for salads",
            "They are endlessly bullying you and she wants to play the embarrassed victim?!?!\n\nIf your family was bullying her, would she expect you to stand up for her? I bet she would.\n\nI would force her to explain why she does not have your back and why she allows this to go on.\n\nIf she cannot stand up to them, then why is she asking you to suffer along side her? She should be encouraging you to stay away from these folks.\n\nenjoy your burger.",
            "I think you should start being rude about it. *\"Thanks but I've has this body for 28 years and know how to feed it. Sorry y'all are so fucking paranoid about food! Worry about your own plate lol.\"*",
            "Just wanted to add: I think it would have completely reasonable for you to firmly stand up for yourself at the birthday, especially that you know your gf won't or cant.\n\nA line like, \" everyone thank you for your concern but I am fully aware the choice I am making and do not need the commentary. Please respect my wishes so I can enjoy.my meal\"",
            "You did GREAT.  She may have cried, but if she can take the lesson here, it'll be AMAZING for her mental health. You are HELPING her by not normalizing this disordered eating style.   \n    \n  This is a  family-based eating disorder.  They have a serious problem with eating, and they're enforcing it on each other.  This is the type of behavior you see in ED clinics, frankly.   The over-wrought \"I'm so DELICATE, I could NEVER!  I'll get sick!\"  It's princess acting.  They are probably starving and they \"help\" each other stay slim by bullying each other out of eating.  It's competitive dieting.  You see it a lot in ballet, modeling, and gymnastics and it's incredibly toxic.   \n    \nI have all the sympathy in the world for your gf growing up in that horrible environment.  \n    \nIt's going to be a journey for her to unlearn this and stand up for herself, let alone stand up for you.",
            "Is her family like generally bigger in size? Or are they all obsessed with working out / dieting? Also curious about their cultural background. Honestly if I was you I\u2019d be just as annoyed. Your gf needs to do something about it and you\u2019re allowed to stick up for yourself. They sound so rude! \n\nI will say, leaving early may have made a scene with them / ur gf after you left. Did she tell you if they said anything or were apologetic at all? Have you otherwise had an okay relationship with them except when it comes to food?",
            "Because I am often snarky, I would show up with groceries saying \"since you obviously can't afford to feed me, I thought I would help out.\"\n\nThat kind of in your face shame will not be forgotten easily.",
            "NTA. But your girlfriend sure is. I hope she cried the whole way home about what a terribly unsupportive person she's being to the person who she's supposed to care the most about. Your girlfriend needs therapy. Her family SUCKS! They either have eating disorders or have decided that anyone who does anything different deserves ridicule. \n\nI strongly caution you to consider what would happen if you stay with your girlfriend and had kids with her someday. God forbid you have a daughter. The in-laws will tear her self esteem apart at every opportunity.",
            "You didn't do anything wrong. It doesn't matter what you eat, it's no one's business. Your health is no one's business. And honestly, if they invite you to eat, they should be expecting you to eat until you're no longer hungry. Leftovers are just that.. whatever is left over after everyone is done eating. \n\nI'm surprised you've handled it so well for 3 years. And honestly, your girlfriend should have said something or backed you up a long time ago. It's her family. This has happened now because she's never stopped them. She just expected you to be a punching bag.",
            "These people are total assholes. I don't blame you for not wanting to eat around them. \n\nHere's an etiquette rule: it's not polite to comment on what other people eat (unless it does indeed infringe on them some way, like you're eating the food they bought for another meal) or you're a child eating a pile of candy before dinner.\n\nI would remind them of this whenever they start up.\n\n\"It's not polite to comment on other people's eating habits.\"\n\nThem: \"But bla bla bla!\"\n\n\"It's not polite to comment on other people's eating habits.\"\n\nMaybe it'll sink into their thick bully brains at some point, but if that's all you say and just eat whatever the hell you want anyway, they might tire of it. \n\nYou can also say, \"I ordered a hamburger, not a nutrition lecture, Susan,\" but I don't know how sarcastic you want to go. \n\nIt kind of sucks that your girlfriend doesn't stand up to them. If she's that scared of her family, you might have to do that for yourself.",
            "Ugh I can not stand food shaming. \n\nYou eat your food and I'll eat mine. Are these people jealous that they aren't able to eat whatever they want (according to them)?\n\nI am a physically fit healthy petite woman but I can NOT imagine talking like this to anyone. You enjoy your food, whatever it is you want at whatever weight you want. None of my business.",
            "Broseph, you did nothing wrong. You stood up for yourself and that is good, OP. Your girlfriend has done nothing to stand up for you, man, are you sure you want to stay with her? Because the longer you stay, the more opportunities there are to be with her family and the more they will treat you like this. This shit ain't healthy, fam",
            "Joke's on them about ordering salads as a main at a restaurant;  a lot of times they're just as much calories and sometimes more than a number of other items on the menu. \ud83d\ude44 Their main mission is to make the salad delicious, not healthy.\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong. In fact, you have been far more patient than most people. Her family sounds insufferable and arrogant about something they refuse to understand and I think you will need to draw a line in the sand with them.",
            "Not cool in-laws! I think you have every right to avoid them. I am curious though,  how much pushback have you given them previous to the last time? Like, have you explained how your metabolism works to them or anything like that? I personally don\u2019t think you should have to - it should be common knowledge not to be a judgemental asshole about the food your guests are eating. \n\n\nHowever, for your SO\u2019s sake you might want to briefly consider, if you haven\u2019t already done this, asking her to send them a message explicitly stating the boundary that you two will leave and never put yourselves in a situation where you are around food with them ever again if they say or communicate to you in any way a single thing about the food you are eating. Let your GF know that you will 100% will be leaving with or without her again. \n\n\nObviously, follow through immediately when they cross your boundary. \n\n\nTell her as well that she specifically needs to be listening for this behaviour too and she needs to defend you when they start talking shit about your food & leaving, she then needs to reiterate the consequences of the crossed boundary and let them know the remedy to this situation is an apology and changed behaviour.",
            "My cousin\u2019s husband likes to make comments about his brother in laws food or amount of food he eats. It\u2019s a pet peeve of mine that I absolutely hate, when someone makes a comment on another person\u2019s eating habits. I couldn\u2019t stay silent at one particular lunch, one day after burying my uncle, cousin\u2019s father. I made the lunch for the whole family and made my cousin\u2019s favourite food. He was going for seconds and brother-in-law had to say, \u201cYou had a huge plateful and now you\u2019re going for seconds?\u201d That was it! I said, \u201cLeave him alone, we just buried his father and he\u2019s barely eaten from the stress and grief!\u201d I looked at my cousin and said, \u201cYou eat as much as you want. Bon appetite!\u201d  The table became very silent, but my cousin smiled at me and ate in peace. Your girlfriend needs to stand up for you. She is just enabling her family and allowing this nonsense to continue. She now has to bare the consequences of you not attending her family gatherings, because of her cowardice on not standing up for you! You handled the situation as well as you could have. This is now on your girlfriend to make things right. Do not apologise! You did nothing wrong.",
            ">GF's mom, sister, and aunt all started commenting about how the burger looked unhealthy.\n\nYikes, I'm sorry OP but your GF and her family are just plain ignorant and ill mannered.",
            "This is a girlfriend problem more than it's a family problem. She needs to be the one to address this with her family but from the sounds of things, she's more interested in \"keeping the peace\" than she is in confronting their horrible behavior.\n\nOne alternative approach is to talk to her and clarify that if she won't defend you to her family, then you have to start defending yourself. They are bullying you and you're tired of being their punching bag. Go over some basic replies that you think you might use too. For example...\n\n*\"I'm not a child and I can make my own decisions about what I do and don't eat. I'd appreciate it if you could respect me enough to stop being so rude about my food choices.\"*\n\nGranted, my petty and unhelpful side would probably make reverse comments...\n\n*\"Oh wow. I can't believe you don't pass out from malnutrition with how little you eat...\"*",
            "They are all ignorant and I\u2019m shocked your GF displays none of these toxic traits.  They obviously have food hangups and are projecting out of their asses.  They sound like every Asian or Indian family I\u2019ve met through dating one of them. They have the same ridiculous body sensibilities.",
            "Does her whole family have disordered eating or something? Their responses are so bizarre.\nOr do they straight up not like you? Either way this is a GF problem. Time for one of you to be explicit with the family - tell them they are rude and you are done tolerating it",
            "Your girlfriend sounds spineless and her family sounds incredibly rude. I don\u2019t think you have to be polite to people who are being rude to you. I would tell my girlfriend that moving forward, you will leave if anyone comments on your food. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter the occasion or location. Or start calling them out. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any manners? Is that how you treat your guests? I\u2019m embarrassed you are behaving this way.\u201d Don\u2019t justify your food choices or fitness level. I would go right back on the offense with them.",
            "That sucks to find out that your girlfriend is never going to have your back. Could you imagine bringing kinds into that environment.  Grandma would give the gift of eating disorders to all her grandchildren for Christmas.",
            "Your girlfriend should be embarrassed for her family, not you. It literally takes nothing to not comment on other people\u2019s food choices if it doesn't affect them. Anyone would be reasonably annoyed by this at the very least. \n\nBut it sounds like your girlfriend has extreme trauma around food and disordered eating, produced by her family. They all have disordered eating habits for sure. I would encourage your girlfriend to talk a nutritionist and counselor, to work through some of this and get some self confidence to stand up to her family. She should be forgoing thanksgiving with her family with you. It\u2019s great that you drew boundaries, but nothing is going to be sustainable or get better if your gf doesn\u2019t realize how fucked up her family\u2019s way of thinking around food is. And likely once your gf starts to come around, it will take years for the family to maybe start to come around. \n\nIf you stay with your gf, this is going to be a lifelong issue, especially the longer she waits to stand up to them. But basically she will have to choose to stand with you, and against her family initially, or stay in the status quo. You can draw hard boundaries now, but this still may be the undoing of your relationship if your gf is as close with her family as she seems to be in your post.",
            "I think you\u2019re pretty level headed. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to expect your gf to be able to defend your boundaries when your own advocacy isn\u2019t working. There\u2019s a hierarchy in her family and they have positioned her as the doormat. It\u2019s part of her psyche and inadvertently probably one of the things you love most about her. When healthy people respect boundaries someone like your girlfriend is kind, generous and giving. When dysfunctional people without good boundaries love someone like her they take advantage, talk over and bully. If you are committed to a relationship with her you will have to be firm on your boundaries and give her the freedom to love her family and create her own boundaries with them. Your example will help but ultimately she has to decide that she doesn\u2019t want to be a doormat anymore. It took me about 55 years. Thankfully I lived 1500 miles away-otherwise my husband probably would have had problems. \n\nLastly you\u2019re a grown man. What you eat is nobody\u2019s business. If you could remove yourself emotionally from this scenario you would see a young man being subservient to these people. This is understandable because these people are your girlfriend\u2019s family and out of respect for her it is natural to be gentler. But think about it (again emotions aside) it wouldn\u2019t be inappropriate for you to call them out. Wow that\u2019s a rude thing for you to say. Or Back off, what I eat isn\u2019t your business. Be more confident in advocating for yourself. These people were rude to you and they treated you like a child. It\u2019s ok to be insulted. It\u2019s okay to tell them to mind their own business. If you are going to be around these people you need to have hard boundaries.",
            "Jesus this family is the perfect example of diet culture and disordered eating. Sounds like you listen to your body and are doing extremely well. You have a great mindset and know when someone has crossed your boundaries. I understand that your girlfriend is scared of them, but I think she needs to work on standing up for herself around them. If she doesn't, this is only going to become a bigger issue as time goes on. Honestly, if you two were thinking about getting married and/or having a family of your own, I wouldn't want my kids around her family. That's setting your children up to have an eating disorder in the future.",
            "If you're going to continue to date your girlfriend and consider occasionally doing  things where food with family might come up I would consider a a combination of grey rock and blandly calling out their behavior for what it is. \n\n\"Do you ever read Ms. Manners? Because it is incredibly rude to discuss other people's food choices.\"\n\n\"Wow, are you still talking about my lunch? How about local sports team?\"\n\n\"Are you still worrying about what other people choose to eat? How embarrassing.\"\n\nCaptain Awkward has some great other scripts for people who insist on this awful behavior if you find yourself dealing with it in the future.",

People like that don\u2019t know what to do when people stand their ground. It will likely shut them up. \n\nShe has no business being upset with you either & you need to also shut that down with her making her see how toxic her family has messed with her mind.",

            "They sound awful! They\u2019re all bullies! I respect whatever limit you choose. Not sure if you tried a blanket statement and repetitive pattern? \u201cPlease stop commenting on my food\u201d \u201chow incredibly rude\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re not my doctor\u201d",

            "Honestly i think this is the best way to handle this.\n\nI broke up with my last boyfriend because i was tired of his comments and side eye Everytime i either ate more than him or had the smallest amount something he wouldn't eat after he went on this extreme diet and cut out everything with sugar or anything he deemed not healthy. He knew i was kinda fat before we met and that i wasn't going to start dieting with him and i talked to him numerous times about it and I was just done. I'll eat what i want when i want and I'd rather be single than deal with constant judgment. Plus after he lost what little weight he had i wasn't even that attracted to him, he literally started to look sick and his cheeks were sunken in and his ass disappeared.",
            "While I can see how you got here and agree that GF should have stood up for you, I don\u2019t think going to the car to finish your food was the right move. It sounds like you go defensive rather than call out the behavior, which is contributing to the behavior growing. If the relationship with GF is one you really want to keep, it may be worth a visit where you commit to bringing sufficient snacks that you don\u2019t try to hide, being very direct, and shutting down her family every single time with hard boundaries. Prep GF for this beforehand. Give her the choice of this scenario or not going at all. The ramifications of boycotting her family over their disordered eating projections could very well end the relationship entirely. Give direct a shot.",

I'm sad for you that your girlfriend didn't stand up for you, and I would recommend dealing with this issue head-on if you think the relationship will get more serious.

If you ever eat with them again, tell them exactly how many calories someone of your height and activity level should be eating. You shouldn't have to do that, but I think it's worth making a point. Let them know that you don't appreciate comments about what you do eat, and that if they continue, you will leave. These people need to be put in their place.",

            "Echoing what a lot of others have said, your GFs family is being completely inappropriate. Whether or not you *are* healthy is irrelevant, they have no right to comment on your body or what you eat or when or how or any of that. They are definitely showing signs of having disordered eating habits, whether they have been diagnosed or not. Disordered eating is more than just people who never eat anything or who eat too much and puke, there's a lot of middle ground. \n\nI'm not going to go off on your GF though. It sounds like she grew up in a very controlling environment, and of course she's scared. It also sounds like you haven't given her the opportunity to meet your needs yet either because it sounds like you haven't clearly communicated them to her yet . I think you need to state your needs, both to her and to her family. No subtle looks or assuming she knows what you want. \n\nFor the family I'd be simple and straight forward, \"I don't appreciate your comments about what I eat and when I eat. It is inappropriate and I will no longer tolerate it. Going forward, if these kind of comments continue, I will leave\". And for your girlfriend \"Hey, this is really important to me, and I'd love your support with it. The way your family talks about the way I eat is harmful to me, and I am no longer willing to tolerate it. I would really appreciate you backing me up in this boundary I'm setting with them, how do you feel about that?\". I think that it would help to be understanding about the complex feelings she likely has about feeling stuck in between two people she cares about ( you and her mom/family), and validate that she is allowed to have hard feelings about that! *And*, you still need support in the boundary. \n\nIt's up to you if you want to change your mind and go back. If you haven't clearly told the family that you don't like/want the food comments, it may be worth it to give them one more chance, and as someone else suggested, to just make a plan to immediately leave the situation if they ignore your boundary and continue making the comments. And make that plan *with* your girlfriend too, so that she isn't caught off guard and can plan to leave with you, potentially suddenly. \n\nGood luck!",
            ">I have to stick up for myself\n\nYes, agreed. But I don't think you're doing that. You're just avoiding the jerks. This can be an effective part of a strategy, but it doesn't get to the root of the problem and it isn't a substitute for setting boundaries.\n\nYou're expecting your girlfriend to speak up for you when you won't speak up for yourself. Yes, this kind of context is one where she should be taking the lead at handling things, since it's her family, but they're also scaring you so much you won't even tell them yourself you're skipping thanksgiving.\n\nHonestly, I think there may just be too great a match between your and your girlfriend's personalities. Neither of you will stand up for yourselves or confront a jerk. I think it will make both of you happier long-term to find a partner who's more confrontational.",

If someone gave me a hard time about ordering a burger I would absolutely be horrified, if it happened twice I would choose to never be around those people. Even if you eat unhealthy (which you say you do not) it's absolutely out of line for their family to openly comment on it, unless you asked for their opinion. One, you are not their child, two you are an adult. It's one thing to express concern for someones health privately and bring it up once with compassion, it's another thing to be catty about it and guilt you during meals. Unacceptable and honestly if I were your sister I would tell you to consider ending the relationship. I wouldn't want to merge with this toxic disrespectful family. You don't just marry the person, you marry the family and you are going to be miserable. What are you going to do? Avoid eating around them? They need to learn manners and boundaries. You say your relationship is strong but there is no way this kind of thing would happen in a solid relationship where there is respect. To have your gf cry on the car ride home? She's 27, put on your big girl pants and draw some boundaries with your overbearing family. Geez, I cannot even fathom commenting on the eating habits of my sibling's partners, especially at the table in front of everyone... talk about complete lack of class.\n\nFrankly, not only should you be sticking up for you but SHE SHOULD BE sticking up for you, it's her family after all. She needs to let her family know ASAP that this kind of commentary on their part isn't acceptable and will no longer be tolerated.

Or bring some groceries when you visit and say you thought this may help since food seems to be 'tight' or a bone of contention' around here. This will highly embarrass them because you'd be suggesting they are poor or secretly struggling. Lol. There is nothing wrong with your eating. Always stick up for yourself. They want to make you lowly and self conscious like your gf, this is the only thing they think they can break you on in order to control you. Think deep about marrying her.",

            "Ask her family members to join you on a long bike ride, when they start getting tired tell them they probably need to eat more so they have energy, take it to the extreme.  Make fun of their salad intake.  At the end of it, offer to pay for a meal and see what they order or if they change their mind.  Also, the real issue probably isn't that they want to nitpick what you eat, they probably have another reason for disliking you and food just happens to be the easiest way for them to target you.",

It may even be toxic on my part. What can I say?",

            " I\u2019m sorry dude but if your girl is fine with enabling her family to treat you this way things won\u2019t ever change. You can\u2019t expect to never share a meal with this family again especially if you have long term plans to spend a life with her. She needs to grow a backbone and tell them to shove it, or she needs to tell you she can\u2019t stand up to them and you need to reevaluate. What happens if you have a daughter and they mold her into someone with an eating disorder? This is not okay.

The comments are similar. \"OMG it's too much food\", \"I can't eat all this\", \"I shouldn't be eating this\", \"I'm fat\" \"she's fat\", \"too many carbs, sugar, fat, etc\" It's toxic.

You're putting your sister in a bad position, and you're being disrespectful to both her and me.\" At that point it's on them. Knowing what people like that are like, they'll probably make random snide and passive aggressive remarks to test you. If they do that you can call them out for trying to disrespect you. \n\nAnd while I think your gf should stick up for you more, it's difficult to do that when you've spent your entire life being subjected to this manipulative crap.

I'd also be mad at the GF for not defending you at all and for being mad at you. You're putting up with abuse due to her family, she needs to be the one to handle them.

Another person\u2019s intolerance to the inner lives of others / knowing that other people have internal lives different from theirs is a major red flag, as are traits like never standing up for your your partner when something deeply insults & upsets them. The toxic family she\u2019d rather appease & continue to spend time with over you (or your feelings) or over going NC is telling you a lot about her. You should listen. And ask yourself, am I willing to put up with this for the rest of my life, or bring children into this dynamic? Imo, you should run from these narcissists and bullies while you still have the chance if she refuses to stand up for you or go NC. Their capacity for cruelty and control will never stop with just you; the children of others are especially favored targets.\n\nYou are literally at your breaking point with this behavior, and yet you continue to be punished for it.

I know how hard it is, sitting there at dinnertime, after doing a Sub 28-29min 5K (I do a lot of running and cycling but I am a big guy) in the morning and the wife done a hour and half PT session being told that what I am eating isnt good for us (need 'real' protein) and how we should train like xyz. I just smile and nod and don't engage and keep eating, usually thats enough, or I ask when they they are going to join me for a 10k trail run.\n\nIt took a lot for my wife to be happy with her body and a lot stems from her mother and her poor relationship with her own body image and eating. Deprogramming eating disorders is very hard no matter what the angle is. \n\nI think you need to explain to your GF that its not this normal to be this obsessed with food and other peoples choices but ultimately, like myself, you may only be able to help your significant other. You need to help her understand, regardless of why, they need to stop making their comments about your food choices and the eating disorders that arise from comments like this. Its not healthy to be this obcessed with food like this. The eating out before going to their house to stop the comments that make you feel bad, thats not healthy but then your GF feels guilty and confesses on top of that? Sounds like she may have been shamed in the past.\n\nMost of all please be mindful of personal issues she may have with her eating and her own body.",

I was eating plant-based/vegetarian at the time so I was disappointed when the dinner location selected was a steakhouse. I ended up piecing together a meal out of sides, but they were all steamed or grilled veggies. The rest of the family feasted on meat and carbs and drank multiple beers. No judgement, it's just what happened. \n\nWe got home later that night and I helped myself to one of the apples I'd purchased for when my pregnant self needed a snack. My ex-MIL called me a little piggy and asked if I could ever \"have enough.\" I was pregnant and she also knew I had a rough history of eating disorders. I cried the rest of the night in the guestroom. \n\nThis was just the beginning of how I'd go onto experience them projecting their own issues with food and body image onto me, their own offspring, and my kiddos.

Not aggressively, but just telling them how much it hurts you and stresses you out when they constantly criticize your eating habits? If your wife can't or won't talk to them on your behalf, then you should probably do it. If it doesn't get addressed, it will get worse because she'll be put on the spot to explain why you never come to family meals anymore. Marriage is hard enough sometimes, and I feel like if this isn't addressed, it will just grow into a massive resentment. P.S. Not sure if you have kids but if you don't say something now, I GUARANTEE when you do, the whole obsession with food will eventually turn into criticizing what you guys are feeding your children!",

I don't like it, didn't ask for opinions and frankly, it's rude.  You are trying to shame me for eating.  I'm healthy, my doctor knows my diet and says it's fine.  Why do you do that?  To make me feel bad?  I think if it were me I would call each of them out, including gf everytime.  Turn to gf and say, why don't you tell them to stop?  It's rude, makes me feel terrible.  I've tried to let it go, I've tried to compromise but they always talk poorly about me to my face and it bothers me.  At this point I wouldn't care if it upsets them.  They are exceptionally rude.

We had fun, and I never spoke to him again.\n\n Cut to now, I have made a really great friend on the playground at my daughter's school. We have a good time chatting and her kids enjoying playing with my daughter. We talked about our jobs, our relationships (me divorced, her married 15 happy years), and the kids. \n\nOn Halloween as I was walking through town with my daughter I bumped in to her, her two littles, and the husband I had yet to meet; the man I fucked in April. My mom friend registered the shock on my face and thought I was surprised at her costume, so I played it off as that, but no; I was staring down her husband who was equally as shocked to see me.\n\n I really do not know what to do here, and this is just fucking absurd. I have no proof other aside from the testimony of the bartender, who checked in with me before I left with him to make sure I was okay.\n\nWhat exactly should I do here?

That's completely rational and understandable. However, your secret could potentially ruin an entire marriage. Plenty of people make mistakes and regret it later on and he may very well be one of those people. Maybe he's already told her. Maybe they have an open relationship. You just don't have all the facts necessary to make such a determination. I would say that you should wait, continue developing this friendship, and find out more information.

Your friendship will probably end, but if you kept a huge secret like this from her, it would have a closeness cap, never be as true and real a friendship as you'd probably like, and end explosively if it ever came to light. I would be much more likely to come to terms with a spouse's betrayal with an unknowing friend and carry on the friendship than I would with someone who kept something like that from me, so while telling her likely means an end to the friendship, I'd argue that it's also the best shot at a long term good friendship with her even if that shot isn't very big.

            "In this situation, you're not in the wrong whether you tell her or not. That said, I think the potential outcomes of keeping the secret are more favorable to telling. The two main reasons I'd take the ignorance is bliss approach to this particular situation are: \n\n\n1) Telling her could ruin your own reputation. There is no real proof that it happened, so it's going to be your word against his. You'll either become the liar, the slut, the destroyer of marriages, etc. It's not likely that they \"won't shoot the messenger\" this time. \n\n\n2) They have two children. I don't know how they view their marriage, but I think divorce is likely when the news comes out. Even if they don't divorce, their relationship probably won't ever be the same. Either way, I don't see this having a positive effect on their children. \n\n\nNow, those outcomes are not your fault or your responsibility. It's all on the husband. That said, if you're the kind of person who likes to watch the world burn, then by all means it's your right to strike the match. Personally though, I would choose not to shatter their world. I'd bury the past, and hope that the husband was shaken enough by your chance meeting to change his ways. If it helps, I doubt he is resting easy knowing his one night stand is friends with his wife. In fact, I hope for the families sake that it stays his secret, and haunts him to his grave. ",

Perhaps he's a great father, a good provider, but their sex life isn't that great. That's still not an excuse, but this could just be a rough spot in the marriage with having a kid and all. As much as I hate cheaters I don't think it's worth it. \n\nPlus I guarantee he is going to be shitting bricks wondering if you are going to tell her. He might take it as a sign that he needs to never do that again considering he was so unlucky that you are his wife's friend now.",

Explain the shocked look on your face, apologize, and make sure you're clear that you were 100% that he was single. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong.

He was basically flirting with me\n\nNext morning I saw them at school, I didn't say anything but he was giving me a \"I wanna fuck you\" looks... Whatever that is.\n\nWhen we got separated from him to go to our classes I told Sarah about what happened. I told her \"I'm not a home wrecker and I hope you marriage works, but Austin sent me these texts\" as I searched for the messages she stopped me and said \"you passed our test.

I mean who does this?  Who does this to someone who is supposedly their best friend?  You know I am insecure about my teeth, and you purposefully told him to use that as a way to flirt with me.

You are the only one that truly knows if this friendship is worth throwing away over this, not all the people here. At least talk to her, and see how she reacts. Show her that you ARE a good friend, so good in fact that you're honest with her, and feel secure enough and love your friendship enough, to tell her when she has hurt you and she obviously needs help, because she does.

He hits on you back, in which case save the messages, show them to your friend, then say, \"looks like you just lost a marriage and a friendship.\"\n\nIn all seriousness, this is incredibly petty and childish behavior that is unbecoming of an actual friend. Cut all ties, if they confront you at school tell them \"I can't be friends with someone who feels its appropriate to test my loyalty by using things that you are aware I'm insecure about.\" Walk away, delete their phone number and delete them on facebook. If you have mutual friends, explain the situation to them, and ensure them they can remain friends with them. Be civil if you run into them, and honestly let them dig their own grave.

They are not sure of themselves, their relationship, or they wouldn't have tested you. Their test proves their insecurity, among them, and about you.\n\n\nYou don't need them.

You probably didn't see something like this coming at all, and it super sucks.\n\nIt seems like a condescending behavior to devise a setup like that, showing that she doesn't trust you, and hypocritical, as she demonstrated that she can't be trusted since her husband built off your insecurities. Its also just an uncomfortable situation you were thrown into with her husband, and gives a strange vibe about him for having gone along with it.\n\nI'm sure you see by now that you're not taking this too seriously. In fact, I would be pissed and feeling a bunch of things. I might even blow up if I were you.\nTherefore, I think one of the best ways you can handle this is keep your cool, and tell her very firmly that you feel creeped out, betrayed, and any other feelings you have, and tell her you need to space from them to think this out.

We didn't try to set him up in anyway.\n\ngood lord, why anyone things this is a set up (apparently 487 up up votes think it is) is beyond me.\n\n\n"

        "selftext": "Original - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3wzgyp/my_21f_boyfriend_23m_10_months_just_told_me_today/\n\nFirstly, thank you so much guys. I received so many helpful comments and messages and I'm truly very grateful. It was nice to see everyone's opinions and have some insight.\n\nHello. Lots of shit has happened since I wrote this post, and it's been pretty hectic. I decided to keep the gift I got him. It was two games for the PS4, and because I like gaming and I didn't have those games, I figured I'd keep them for myself. I knew taking them back would be pointless because I'd end up buying something similar anyway. So, I opened them as I was feeling way too stressed about this and played them happily. It did cheer me up a bit, and so did calling a few friends.\n\nSo, I decided to speak to him. I went over to his house and I asked him if this meant I'd not be getting presents for my birthday or Valentine's either, and he said those holidays were different. Apparently the only holiday he was against giving gifts on is Christmas. This confused me even more, as if he's against present-giving, shouldn't it be for ALL holidays and not just one? I asked him if it had to do with religious reasons and he said no, he just disliked the idea of Christmas and that was it. He had been brought up thinking it wasn't normal to give presents on Christmas.\n\nThen, I brought up another point that was mentioned a few times in the comments. How come I wasn't an exception? I should be just a little bit important to him, I hope, and therefore he could have bought me something anyway just because I'm his girlfriend and it would have been nice to receive something. He told me he'd never make an exception for anyone because those were his beliefs and anyone who dated him would need to understand and respect that.\n\nWe argued for a LONG time, like I'm thinking we spent at least four hours just sitting in his room discussing why he was so against giving me anything. Also, why was he so alright with buying me something for my birthday and Valentine's, but not Christmas? I would understand if it was for religious reasons but he clearly stated it had nothing to do with that. He blamed it on his parents, which makes the next part even MORE INTERESTING.\n\nHis mother comes into the room, asking us to come into the living room. I knew they were leaving on the 24th for a small vacation, so I was wondering if this was a small goodbye or maybe even perhaps to scold us for yelling at each other. The house is big but I don't doubt they could have heard a little bit. And then, I was speechless. Sitting on the fucking dining table are his parents and SIX WRAPPED UP GIFTS. I look at him. Like, really? You don't celebrate giving presents on Christmas because your parents are against it, BUT THEY DO? The parents sat us down and gave each of us a gift and told us to open it now and we'd have our own small Christmas just a day before. I opened it, was a lovely gift, thanked them, etc, all while killing my boyfriend mentally. I was a little annoyed.\n\nAnd then this happens. He starts grinning while I'm glaring, and takes out a gift. For me. I want to cry at this point. What the fuck is actually going on? He hands me the gift, and it's a Swarovski necklace, looking pretty expensive. He smiles, the parents leave to give us some space and I smile back, still REALLY FUCKING CONFUSED. He said it was hard to try and hide this gift while I was yelling at him earlier, but all along he HAD made an exception for me. All of it was a surprise. He doesn't believe in present-giving, but still had bought me one anyway just because he thought I deserved it. So, at this point, he still doesn't believe in giving anyone presents but he did buy me one. I was immediately really happy and hugged him. It's a lovely necklace, and I apologised over and over again for yelling. We have a really nice time and head back to the bedroom and watch tv, cuddling and having a sweet time.\n\nHe then asks for his present. I tell him I've opened them already and kept them for myself, so I'm going to need time to buy him a new one. He suddenly becomes furious. I explained he told me he wasn't going to get me something, so OBVIOUSLY I wasn't going to be giving him one if I wasn't supposed to expect anything back. He gets really mad, saying I should have kept the present for him because in the end he did get me something. But how was I supposed to know that?! He begins to scream about how I'm an ungrateful cow, and how he shouldn't have spent a penny on me. His mother comes in, tells him to calm down, and he screams at me to leave the house and he never wants to see me again. I do, and take the necklace (perhaps a bad move :p). I explained I will buy him a new gift, a better one, and still he's too angry at me to understand he only needs to wait a day.\n\nI left and came home, REALLY FUCKING CONFUSED. I tried calling and he hasn't answered. I've been calling since I left the house three hours ago. Guys, I don't know what to do. I'm so fucking confused and today has been one hell of a day. Any advice in appreciated. I'm thinking of going back there tomorrow. I'm sorry if this wasn't written the best way, my head is all over the place. I've also spoken to my best friends and they're also confused as hell. Thanks in advance.\n\n**TLDR - I got angry at boyfriend and asked him to explain why he was against giving me anything for Christmas and not my birthday or Valentine's. He explains parents taught him it's wrong to give presents on Xmas. We had a fight. Parents ask us to come into living room, they've all bought us presents. He grins, he's ended up buying me a present, making an exception. I tell him I have no present for him. He gets mad. Not sure if we're still together.**",

Don't date men who throw insta-tantrums and scream at you. Getting *this mad* over something like this isn't normal.",
            "Sooooo....he tells you that he doesn't want to exchange gifts, then gets upset when you believe him?  \n\nSounds like a real winner you've got there.",
            "That is some weird game playing on the part of the bf.  That kind of pranking and\"gotcha\" is just plain sicko.  He kept you in his room FOUR damn hours telling you why he won't give you a gift and then pulls the old \"where's my gift.\"  A friend doesn't treat a friend like that.  I would not find his behavior forgivable and would return the necklace. And I surely would not want to spend the next few years trying to figure out when he is pranking me and when he is being truthful. I'd end the relationship.",
            "What happened here was, he had a very specific scenario worked out in which you were going to be swept off your feet by the surprise necklace. What he didn't take into account is that when you surprise people, you risk them having an unpredictable reaction. Now he's butthurt that you didn't react the way he scripted everything out in his head.  \n\nI think you should send the necklace back and break up, but if you do try to work it out, you need to tell him to be more respectful and show more empathy. This whole exchange showed that, in the process of giving you a gift, he was entirely focused on himself.",
            "This was so painful to read from start to finish. Except where you got to play the Ps4. That was a cool part. \n\nYour boyfriend is really, really, exhaustingly immature. I think he is living in the Hollywood mentality where these big stupid surprise gestures make a relationship good, rather than comfortable and honest communication.\n\nI'm not saying you have to break up with him immediately, but unless he snaps out of this really quick and learns how to be in a grown up, real life relationship... I dunno. This sounds terrible to have to deal with.\n\nEdit: I just read where he called you a cow and screamed at you... I'll admit I started skimming because I was cringing so hard and I missed that. Nope nope nope. Dump dump dump. Give the necklace back and enjoy the Ps4. Don't you dare buy him anything, good lord woman, have some self-respect. This guy is horrible. He lost any consideration when he started scream and name calling. Jesus Christ. Please just move on.",

            "Give him back the necklace and get the heck out of there.  My ex pulled something like this with me.  We had a huge argument about marriage (he had never said he didn't want to get married before, we were planning on buying a house, having kids, etc.)  And when I brought it up wondering about a timeline he got mad, explained why he didn't want marriage, that if I wanted to be with him that's how it was going to be.....I decided marriage wasn't as important as being with him and stayed.  He surprised me with an engagement ring 2 months later and a \"I really threw you off didn't I!?\"  \n\nShoulda been a sign that he really wasn't a good person.  And it was a prelude of the abuse that was to come.  You don't jerk someone around like that, get into arguments and upset them, and then randomly change your mind and expect to be applauded for it.\n\nRun while you can OP.",
            "*Looks at boyfriend's age* Ummmmm.... 21, not 12? \n\nThis is a maturity thing, or an empathy thing.  Maybe his brain just hasn't baked enough yet. But his reaction to your non-gift was a bit over the top. Is that kind of reaction normal?\n\nThe stance on presents is weird too. I mean it's great he finally got you one, but the \"gotcha\" nature of the \"surprise!\" is a bit immature. What on earth did he expect?\n\nIn some respects he's young and maybe you should give him a pass for this, but your actions were by no means a \"screaming yelling\" cardinal sin type of offense.  See if he calms down and what he says then.",

Taking the necklace just gives the screamer more \"weight\" over you.  Send it back.  No amount of necklaces or video games will outweigh the freedom of *no screaming about gifts*.\n\n> Not sure if we're still together.\n\nWhy the hell would you want to be after this?  Are you nuts?

I read through this a couple of times and have come to the conclusion :  his parents *knew* and *approved* of his weird prank, joke whatever.  Maybe they did that to him when he was growing up.  What the heck.  Maybe they all think that is appropriate fun time stuff.  Well they are wrong.  Can you imagine staying with this guy, getting married, having a child and when the child is old enough to understand getting presents for Christmas, have him pull this s**t on a four year old.  This was not normal behavior from him OR his parents.",
            "Give the necklace back and get shot of him. \n\n\nSeriously he's a fucking moron sure it looked good on paper but fucking stupid executing it.

It is kind of like he wants to be in a relationship with a doll programmed to his specifications, not a real person with emotions and a point of view.  \n\nAnd his parents were in on it, which indicates that this is an ingrained pattern of behavior and not a one-off.  \n\nHe lied to you, repeatedly, to protect the secret that he got you a Christmas present.  This is a man who is capable of lying to you about much more serious things.  \n\nThis isn't a guy you can have a healthy relationship with.  ",
            "What a fucked up reverse version of Gift of the Magi. ",
            "Man, this takes the cake for mind games. \n\nWanting a gift to be a surprise is all well and good, but he took it WAYYY too far, to the point where it actually caused problems in your relationship. This guy, at best, has shit communication skills. At worst, he's deliberately cruel and manipulative. \n\nIf you break up over this it'll be a blessing. This guy isn't mature enough to be in a serious relationship.",

            "Don't go back there tomorrow.  Don't call him.  Don't text him.\n\nHis behavior is manipulative and unacceptable.  There's nothing you can do or say that would fix this in any way.\n\nIf you really want to keep the necklace, keep it.  It was a gift.  If you would rather return it, drop it in the mail (with insurance and proof of delivery).\n\nAs for the boyfriend, I wouldn't recommend staying with him.  And, this close to Christmas, I wouldn't recommend dealing with even talking or communicating with him.  If I were you, I would go completely No Contact with him, enjoy my quiet holiday, return the necklace through the mail, and send a note breaking up with him in the same package.",
            "So, I can kind of see where your BF was coming from *initially*.  (My story on why is below if you care to read it.)  HOWEVER.  The four hour discussion was over the line, and the way he acted after you told him what had happened with his gift is completely unacceptable.  He didn't make an exception for you because he cares about you, he made an exception hoping to get brownie points and a nice gift in return.  This was not a no-strings-attached I-love-you gift.  It was a \"look how good I did even though I didn't *want* to, so you owe me!\" gift.\n\nI'd cut him loose, personally.  Name-calling (he called you a cow?!  Fuck that shit) is not acceptable under any circumstances and he seems very immature.  Best case, he's a manchild.  Worst case, he has serious anger issues and is totally unhinged.  I'm leaning toward the latter.\n\nOP, my husband tried something like this once.  It was a bit different, but it was when we were discussing engagement rings.  Neither of us had much money, and he was adamant about the kind of wedding bands he wanted.  So, I thought it only fair that I get a bit of a say in the engagement ring.  Nope, he shot down every single thing I showed him, including (crushingly) the absolutely most beautiful, perfect ring I found.  He said he didn't like it at all and just outright vetoed it.  After weeks of being told no about each and every ring, I finally snapped saying it wasn't fair that he got to pick out every-fucking-thing and he wasn't the one that had to wear the damn thing in the first place and why didn't my feelings matter?\n\nWell, it turns out that he was going to pretend not to like the ring and then surprise me with it.  He didn't realize how worn down I was getting with him constantly telling me no, or that it felt to me like he didn't care at all about what I liked.  When I finally poured out my heart to him he came clean, and admitted that he'd kept it up for so long because he was hoping to be able to afford the ring, but with how I was feeling and the price of gold going up it turned out that we couldn't afford it anyway, and my feelings were more important than his charade.\n",
            "Sadly, my gut was right. A lot of people argued in your first post that you should respect him not giving gifts...but they WAY he went about it screamed selfish manipulator to me.  I wish I had been wrong.\n\nPlease don't stay with someone who screams at you and verbally abuses you.  And pay attention to his family ignoring your 4 hour fight...my abusive exes family ignored him screaming at me for hours while I was backed into a corner by my throat. He has learned this at home...don't ever go back to him.",

            "To me your boyfriend's \"I'm not making an exception for you, oh wait I made an exception for you, what the hell I'm totally mad you believed I didn't make an exception for you\" sequence of behaviors is the definition of \"playing games\". On r/okcupid we complain about people who mention in their boring profiles \"I don't play games\"\u2026well, your boyfriend couldn't even write that in his boring profile truthfully.\n\nHis behavior is manipulative, dishonest, and intense in a bad kind of way. Yes the necklace was expensive and beautiful\u2026but what about the 4 hours of yelling? Not to mention that it was misleading *on purpose*.\n\nIn college I had an eccentric and highly intellectual friend. We were very close. At one point she had a problem with a mutual friend and somehow drew me into it. She got me on the phone for this long, protracted friendship breakup with her, saying she couldn't be friends with me if I was still friends with our mutual friend. I was really upset and spent 2 hours trying to be logical in how to solve the problem, to plead with her, to explain why we didn't have to end our friendship. Tears were shed. She insisted. Once the phone call was over she began e-mailing me about how it was all a ploy to \"punish herself\" by taking away my friendship. At that point I knew I was truly done. Why would she torture me like that and still expect we could be close?\n\nI share the story because it reminds me of what your boyfriend did. I don't know how you could trust him after this.

You let gifts ruin your relationship, and yes,  YOU let that happen,  because you didn't drop it. \n\n\nLook,  if someone is set in their ways and it's something as silly as an Xmas gift,  it's something you need to express your feelings over,  listen to his feelings about it and then move on. You don't argue about a fucking gift for four hours and then expect your relationship to be alright. For goodness sake,  you need to learn when to drop things. If someone is so set in their ways that they won't change their mind after even half an hour of DISCUSSING (not arguing) it then you either need to accept it or leave if you can't. \n\n\nIt sounds like you both have a lot of growing up to do. He's reacted this way because you have done exactly what he originally did to you. His reaction is to yell and ask you to leave, your reaction was to argue for four hours. You both reacted badly, but really you need to understand in the end,  you put him in the exact same position he said he was going to put you in. Omg seriously this is ridiculous. ",

And you dating someone does not entitle you to gifts.\nYou should of seeked the thrill of giving him something he'd enjoy without worrying about GIMME GIMME GIMME\nWhen you said \"yeah I opened his presents they're mine now\" I was like well alright if you see gift giving as an exchange that's reasonable he's not entitled to gifts either. But man you going to argue with him about his morals was frustrating. If someone says they don't like Christmas gift exchanges than why argue and try to change that or make yourself an exception?\nHowever, im not making you the villain here by any means, because on the other end it seems your boyfriend was more concerned about RECEIVING and felt more entitled to gifts than even you did. And went way too far and threw a fit and got all offended by your logical side of the situation (opening his gifts) there is the perspective that he's probably pretty pissed off thinking \"oh so you will only buy me presents if I buy you something too??\" Which is 100% true and would be upsetting for a man to realize about his girl. But once again, he's a total ass for how he reacted. He's quite unstable and manipulative. That alone is enough to need to keep him out.\nBtw taking off with his necklace wasn't a \"lol oops bad move ahh well mine now\" thing. That was bullshit man could've been a bigger person!

            "I love the one sided view from people. Why did you return the gift to begin with? Because he wasn't getting you anything? Seems selfish on your part too, no? If the only reason you're giving a gift is because you want something in return then stop giving gifts. Giving gifts should be because you want to not because you want a gift in return. Yea I would be disappointed if I gave a gift and received none but it wouldn't be a giant deal. His reaction was just as ridiculous though and really overreacted about this whole situation. Honestly doesn't sound like this is a compatible relationship if little things like these set you both off. Let him cool down and sit down and have an adult discussion about what you expect and how to avoid this in the future, maybe then you can move forward but sit and think if this is what you want. Sounds like he wanted to surprise you with the gift, which he did. Also that he didn't think you'd return the gift just because he said he wasn't getting you anything, valid point as well on his end.

But to decide that you weren't going to give him his already boughten presents changed the dynamic of your intentions. If giving gifts is about *giving* then you shouldn't have expected a gift in return. By obliging his request to not give you a gift you aren't necessarily stating that you wouldn't give him his too. I think you turned it into a tit for tat situation. Had you decided \" well I might not be getting any gifts but I *still* *want* *to* *give* \" then that would show a lot of moral fiber. Now don't get me wrong you're entitled to change your mind but it's your actions that are speaking to your true intentions here. You made it petty.

Ive always gotten my siblings presents regardless of whether they could afford to get me some.

No one's obligated to give you anything, ever. I don't care if it's your birthday, Christmas, Valentine's day - you're not OWED a gift. Period. That someone goes out of their way to give you a gift is what makes it a gift. Otherwise it's what you seem to think it is - an *expectation*. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHis behavior and reaction was over the top. Obviously neither ONE of you have anything but a consumer-based thought on gift giving. Neither of you is capable of giving a gift without expecting one in return. I'd apologize for being rude enough to take back a gift for no reason and I wouldn't go near him until I had received an apology for screaming at you and name calling. I'd then have a SERIOUS discussion about whether you want to continue this relationship and, if you do, set down some ground rules of NO MORE LYING and NO surprises. He obviously sucks at both. Then get into his anger and why he felt it necessary to start screaming and kick you out of the house for something so damn petty.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you decide not to continue the relationship, I'd still apologize for being rude as fuck, hope (but don't EXPECT) for an apology on his part and give him back the necklace. Then wash your hands of him. Maybe use your new free time to do a little volunteer work (I'm sure  there's some coat drives for children going on this time of year that could use some help) and see if you can't rid yourself of that bad case of the \"GIMMIES\" you seem to have contracted.",

She probably wants everyone to validate her low class drainage behavior\n\nI just read the original thread and the whole negativity of the sub just disgusts me. A whole bunch of utterly selfish and materialistic people. \n\n>I feel as if things have changed since this conversation, in only a few hours. I feel as if I'm obviously not too important to him if he hasn't gone out of his way to get me even a tiny gift. I made it clear I do like giving and receiving presents, and I told him I'd already bought his, so he said he'd take his then. Is it wrong of me to not want to give him his present if I won't be receiving one? I think it's a little selfish he's going to accept his present without giving me anything.\n\nGifts are not barter. They are not business or wealth exchange. The spirit of gift giving is to share your happiness with your loved ones. She made all these arguments about how not  giving a gift meant that he did not care enough for her. But once she found out she won't be receiving gift, she kept it for herself and wanted to breakup. For someone that believed in gift giving so much, all it took was a little convincing from the crowd.\n\nThen she went back and ragged him a lot more about her gifts. \n\n>So, I decided to speak to him. I went over to his house and I asked him if this meant I'd not be getting presents for my birthday or Valentine's either, and he said those holidays were different. Apparently the only holiday he was against giving gifts on is Christmas. This confused me even more, as if he's against present-giving, shouldn't it be for ALL holidays and not just one? I asked him if it had to do with religious reasons and he said no, he just disliked the idea of Christmas and that was it. He had been brought up thinking it wasn't normal to give presents on Christmas.\n\n>Then, I brought up another point that was mentioned a few times in the comments. How come I wasn't an exception? I should be just a little bit important to him, I hope, and therefore he could have bought me something anyway just because I'm his girlfriend and it would have been nice to receive something. He told me he'd never make an exception for anyone because those were his beliefs and anyone who dated him would need to understand and respect that.\n\n>We argued for a LONG time, like I'm thinking we spent at least four hours just sitting in his room discussing why he was so against giving me anything. Also, why was he so alright with buying me something for my birthday and Valentine's, but not Christmas? I would understand if it was for religious reasons but he clearly stated it had nothing to do with that. He blamed it on his parents, which makes the next part even MORE INTERESTING.\n\nFor someone that opened and used the gifts that she bought him without any hesitation once she realized she wouldn't get any in return, she went back and argued a lot of time about her God given right to receiving gifts and how she should be an exception/ \n\nAnd in the end, absolutely classless OP ran away with her gift. \n\nMaybe the guy was pissed because how much OP harassed him for one or how much she emphasized the importance of giving gifts to loved ones. \n\n>He doesn't believe in present-giving, but still had bought me one anyway just because he thought I deserved it.\n\nOP convinced a guy that is not into gift giving into realizing how important it is, only for him to realize that her whole argument was bullshit and just self serving so that she could get some gifts. And that she gave away stuff that was supposed to be for him once she realized she wasn't getting any. \n\nThen to top it off, she ran away with the gift with absolutely no shame and her two annoying posts in the sub are asking if she should keep them. The same crowd in her older thread who told her \n\n>\"I'm not getting you anything but I'll happily accept the $100+ of gifts you bought for me without reciprocating!\" Yeah, no. You take that shit back and buy yourself a nice gift.\n\nare fine with her taking the necklace and selling it off as seen in the most popular replies to her post. So, she takes his expensive gift, doesn't give anything back, breaks up and sells it off. Epitome of lady behavior. \n\nEven with the guy being the utter douche as he is, I cannot decide which one  was the more scummier of the two. ",

It was the big 3-0 and while I didn't care about presents I wanted to CELEBRATE. I just wanted a romantic night out with him. I called my mom crying and she immediately organized a dinner and called to inform him that we were having a big get together and that she'd made reservations for us. \n\nWell lo and behold he'd been planning a romantic dinner for 2 at one of the nicest restaurants in town. He had to cancel his reservations and was so pissed and upset we ended up having a huge fight and spent three hours arguing after my mom dropped $600 on a dinner neither of us enjoyed. \n\nBut you know what? He didn't call me ungrateful or a cow. He was upset because his surprise was ruined, not because he didn't get what he wanted.  The issue here is not the lead up, but the way your boyfriend spoke to you after.

If we, her family, don't guess her true desire, we are all assholes who don't care to know her well enough to have guessed the secret gift. \n\nIt's worse when she's dating someone. She is super unaware of these problems and truly believes it's everyone else's fault. Calling her on it results in months of silent treatment for which we are expected to apologize. \n\nI see this as behaviour that is separate from her diagnosis, but it is worth mentioning she is bipolar. Her mood does play a role.",

Especially one with the circumstances like this.\n\nI would wrap it up and give it to him as his gift.

Has a gift for you to immediately inspire guilt in you for being so \"mean\" as to argue with him over something he has secretly changed his mind about. \n\n4. Gets mad at you that after specifically telling you that a gift exchange would not occur, only a gift transfer and manipulating your emotions for his own personal delight, further proves his douchebaggery by screaming at you for believing him in the first place. \n\nSo zero of this is really your fault, and he is continuing to be a jerk by behaving like a toddle having a snit, getting you worked up AGAIN.

Perhaps they want to focus on whatever their religious beliefs are, or simply family, something like that. If truly giving a gift, no gift should be expected in return, otherwise you are just bartering unknown items and hoping you come out ahead in the deal.\n\nTherefore, I think OP should have given bf the gift and not been upset about not getting anything in return. Also, bf shouldn't be mad that he didn't get anything because he made it clear he didn't want to exchange gifts. Neither one seems to do gift giving very well and seem more focused on gift receiving.\n\nUltimately, I recommend breaking up and sending the necklace back to him so its a clean break with no residual ties. I don't think its necessary to send it back as it was a gift, but why would OP want to keep something tainted with such a wild situation? Giving it back is the decent thing to do.\n\nBut, what do I know, I'm just a random internet hobo, with a digital bindle slung over my shoulder, riding the fiber optic rails.",

I couldn't imagine adding friends and relatives/relatives in law into that.",
            "Welllllllll I'm going go massively against the grain here, do bring on the down votes! I still hope you read my advice. \n\nFirst of all, I would like to agree with what a lot of other people have said - your boyfriend shouldn't have got as angry at you as he did, there's certainly no excuse for screaming and shaming and having a temper tantrum over something like this. I mean seriously. Also letting you argue for *four hours* when he knew he got you a gift was just nuts. \n\n**HOWEVER**. I think the fact you unwrapped, used and kept the gifts you bought him was shallow and mean of you and I can understand why he would be upset. \n\nIn today's culture, gifts should be about giving without the expectation of receiving, even in family and couples. Yes it's nice to get something in return and feel equally valued but some people show their value for people in ways other than gifts. In your original post, if I'd seen it a week ago, my advice would have been to give him the gifts anyway but also have a simple and mature conversation with him that basically said \"I've already spent quite a bit of money on gifts for you, I didn't know you didn't 'do' gifts, it would have been nice if you'd told me earlier than the middle of December when you can probably assume I've already got you something - however I bought the gifts with  you in mind and they are for you so even if you don't get me anything in return, you can still have yours\". I think the fact you decided to keep them rather than just return them (or give them regardless) was quite spiteful, or at the very least makes you look like you only buy someone gifts with the expectation of receiving something back. Which in my opinion is not what presents are for. \n\nWith that said I really do think your boyfriend overreacted and he needs to learn to control his temper. \n\nAlso you should give the necklace back to him because otherwise you come across just as a lot of redditors thought your boyfriend did in your original post.\n\nAs for moving forward? That's up to you. Personally after only ten months I don't think it'll be worth holding on to a relationship like this with so much drama, and from your perspective you don't want to be a man child who screams at you over what was essentially a misunderstanding *that he caused*. However in  your shoes I would also do some deep inner reflecting and ask yourself if you are really proud or happy with your actions or decisions too, because I certainly wouldn't be. ",
            "Okay, it was really dickish of him to throw you out like that, *BUT* you had already told him that you had bought him a gift... so... he was kind of expecting one at that point, don't you think? Also, this is a heck of a lot of drama over Christmas gifts; you do realize that the point is to give a gift and *not* expect on in return, yes? I can understand where you would be disappointed that he had not planned to get you anything, but opening up and using his gifts that you had already bought and told him you had bought all because you didn't think he was getting you something is really childish. The correct response would have been to accept the possibility of not getting a gift and still giving him the one you had already bought because that's the spirit of the holiday. It would have avoided all this brouhaha. \n\nAnyway, obviously, his reaction was WAY over the top and unnecessary. I think you can consider this relationship over. In the future, I suggest that you both grow up and not put so much weight on gifts. If you love each other, that should be enough; gifts are just a pleasant surprise and should never be expected. ",
            "I had to scroll up and read your ages again. I was sure you two were 16/17. I'm 23, and it is unfathomable to me to act this way. Here's an immature, manipulative ass and I'd be gone after his temper tantrum and lying to \"surprise\" you.\n\nI didn't see your original post, but I would also not have made as big a stink about him not believing in gifts for Christmas. Feeling upset is expected, but trying for hours to talk him into making an exception for you is not. If it's a deal breaker for you, that's fine, but the sooner you realize people do things out of the norm and shouldn't change just because you want them to, the sooner your life will get easier. \n\nAlso, why couldn't you just wrap the games up again and gift them as originally intended? Unless there is some DLC content you already claimed, I don't see why you wanted to get him something new. I don't suggest giving him a gift at all, at this point, but just trying to understand your logic. ",

            "Wow. This is why I don't like \"surprises\". \n\nI don't know who started the whole idea of surprise parties, surprise gifts, or surprise proposals. \n\nTo really surprise someone, you're supposed to lie to them. To lie to someone is to manipulate someone. How is that ever a good thing to do in any type of relationship? \n\nNot to mention, even though he lied for good intentions, he should have told you the truth the moment it seemed that it bothered you. Instead, he let you get all upset about it, **enjoys you being upset**, and **then** gives you the present. \n\nWho in their right mind enjoys seeing other people upset?

Playing devils advocate here, but I've never given gifts to someone on the condition I get one in return. If I get one back that's great, but if I don't, at least I made someone I care about feel nice with the gift. \n\nMaybe your bf feels the same way. Realizing you bought him a gift, then decided to keep it for yourself just because he wasn't giving you one, well...it says a bit about why you bought the gift in the first place. \n\nYes you should give the necklace back. ",
            "This is some serious red flag waving. He argued with you for 4 hours, just to fuck with you then he gave you a gift and then he asked for his gift from you (after he had already told you that you were not exchanging gifts) and THEN he flipped the fuck out at you. He is setting up relationship dynamics where you can never be sure of yourself, you can never be confident, and he is in control of your feelings. You can do better.  ",
            "Here's my perspective:\n\nI think this situation would have been entirely different if he had told you he didn't want to exchange gifts and you never bought him one because of that and then he surprised you with your gift, catching you completely off guard. The fact that you initially bought him a gift because you wanted to, and then decided to not give him the gift and keep it for yourself only after you realized you weren't getting anything in return is probably what he's upset about. It's not so much the fact that he didn't get a gift as much as it is the fact that, to him, it seems that him getting a gift is entirely dependent upon him getting you one first. So that's probably where the next conversation between the two of you needs to go.\n\nAt the end of the day, he had a scenario worked out in his mind where he'd sweep you off your feet with a surprise gift. It didn't work out the way he wanted, so he's a little upset. That's his issue to get over. He shouldn't expect you to read his mind and know exactly how to play along with his plans/should be prepared and have a contigency plan for you not reacting exactly how he expected. However, for all you posted/told him that you, as his girlfriend, should be an exception to his non-gift giving tradition, the inverse is equally true. You should have given him the gift you initially bought him, regardless of his actions. Even if it was just to be the bigger person in the situation. That part is where you messed up.\n\nEdit: Also after reading some of the comments in this thread, anyone advocating that OP should keep the necklace and dump the boyfriend is a sorry excuse for a human being. OP listen, at the end of the day, it's your choice whether you stay with this guy. Personally, if this is the first major problem you two have ever had, I think it's a dumb reason to break up over. But that's not my call to make, it's yours. That said, if you leave him, give the damn necklace back. Jewelry isn't cheap, in fact in most cases it's ridiculously overpriced because companies know they can charge out the ass because guys feel a certain sense of obligation to buy those types of things for their significant others. This goes double for name brand shit. If you have the right to keep/not give him his gift simply because you thought he didn't get you anything in return, then he has an equal right to get his money back for that necklace if you decide to no longer be his girlfriend over this. It's just the right thing to do.",

Most of us guys are!! Its just finding one who can own it and tries to keep that part of him in check) at least he did think enough about you to make an exception. So here is what you do.You play his game right back. Get him a gift and wrap it up.Give it to him and play it off like a big joke and dothe same \"man it was hard keeping a straight face while you were telling meyou never want to see me again\" \nSeriously though...you already know what Reddit is gonna tell you to do. If you aren't married...break up and no contact\nIf you are married...lawyer up divorce ,and no contact. That is the wonderful advice you get from Reddit. So the real question is what do you think you should do? Do you care for the guy? Is this a fight you can see yourself working past? If the answer is yes then when he calms down apologize and tell him that you thought he was serious and as much as you'd like to channel your Ms. Cleo..that you can't. So you had no way of knowing. And that you were just trying to respect his wish of no giving gifts. Not that\"Well you didn't get me anything so you didn't deserve anything either \"...If he still wants to break up then I say let him. But guess what? Relationships NEVER go 100% smooth. Its just a matter of how much bullshit you're willing to put up with to make it work. If you never give your partner a difficult time dealing with you and they're always a pain in the ass then leave. If youre not an Angel 100% of the time you can't expect them to be either. That's why relationships are 50/50...good and bad. If you can look past this and work it out do it. And open up the lines of communication. I will give you some of the best advice I think you'll receive here though with this...if you're arguing for 4 hours...then that convo is going in circles and you need to step back.. Leave....whatever....then approach it again at a later date. Next day...two days...whenever. But 4 hours of arguing is not going to end with someone seeing the other persons point",
            "*Before you read this: the boyfriend's reaction as described wasn't cool. The resolution of this is obviously to end the relationship.*\n\nTl;dr - So let me get this straight...you spent a week upset because he didn't make an exception for you, then are surprised that he was upset because you wouldn't make an exception for him?\n\nHe told you he doesn't believe in giving (Christmas) gifts. Maybe it doesn't make sense to you, but that's not the point. He doesn't believe in it and won't make an exception for you. You're upset, so much so that you're questioning \"how important this relationship is to him\". What's your main concern? \"Is it wrong of me to not want to give him his present if I won't be receiving one?\" \n\nMy question is, how important is he to you? Reading through the original, I thought the idea to take back the gifts (or keep them to yourself) was petty. If he's important to you, don't you want to give him a gift? Or were you only ever going to get him something if you got something also? You essentially chose to punish him for not giving Christmas presents. And you treated him like you'd treat anyone else (give to get)...you didn't make an exception for him. \n\nIn the end, if you'd never gotten him a gift, I don't think he'd have been upset. But you told him you got him a gift, and took it back because he stuck to his beliefs. That's not cool. He was right in the OP, if you're going to date someone, you should respect their beliefs (or move on). \n\nGift giving is supposed to be about *giving*. The quid pro quo ruins it. But even if you'll only give gifts to people when you expect something in return (which is a pretty shitty way to treat friends and loved ones), if you expect you your SO to make exceptions for you, you should be prepared to make exceptions for him. Like giving him his gift when his beliefs won't allow him to give you one.\n\nYou two should obviously break up. But pay attention to what you do in your next relationship. \n",
            "Your boyfriend is fucking crazy. Also, I'm pretty sure you're single now.",
            "He sounds like a royal dipshit. Go enjoy that PS4. Don't get him anything. You deserve better than a four year old who bitches about gifts and demands you not get him something and then gets pissed when you don't. \n\nedit: spelling",
            "I got really sad when I read about your boyfriend berating you for not having his gift, and your response was to promise him an even better gift than the one you originally had.\n\nWhy are you trying to placate him?  It's a bad move with toddlers and it's a bad move with adults.  \n\nI never, ever say this in my advice on this sub, but you should dump his sorry fucking ass.  He sucks.\n",
            "He wanted to make you feel so bad you'd be extra super grateful to him for doing the standard thing that boyfriends are expected to do. So, it was an active campaign to make you feel anxious, insecure, undervalued and like crap. ",
            "Well let me add my POV which will probably be a little different than most of the comments I've read so far.\n\n1) As some people have said you should be really wary of dating someone who has tantrums over something \"small\" such as this, specially if he goes around name-calling you. I mean him getting upset would have been understandable, but calling you an \"ungrateful cow\" blows everything out of proportion.\n\n2) Why is gift giving an exchange for you? I mean, whenever I buy someone a gift, independently of how much I spend on it, I don't do it expecting something in return. Nor do I equate my gift giving with receiving something. I have been in a relationship for 6 years and I make significantly more than my GF, so there has been times where she wouldn't buy me anything for christmas/valentines day and I would give her something expensive. This was not an issue exactly because nobody forced me to buy her anything. If it were the case that he had made an agreement to buy something for you and didn't deliver than it would be a completely different situation. (This also applies to him, of course. If you create a situation where you say you don't like gift giving and than throw a tantrum when you don't get a gift you are either crazy or dumb)\n\n3) This is just out of curiosity, but why is receiving a christmas gift something so important to you that you would get so upset and argue with him about it for four hours as you said?\n\nJust to be clear, I'd say you did something sorta wrong when opened the present you had bought him out of spite for him not giving you something, however I think he blew things out of proportion when he created the situation that caused your actions and specially when he called you an \"ungrateful cow\". I believe you shouldn't continue your relationship with him because no matter how mad me and my GF got on a 6 yr relationship none of us has ever said something remotely close to that to each other. Anyone that would refer to their SO like that either doesn't respect/care about them or has serious control/aggresion issues. You SHOULD NOT approach him to apologize, nor should you give your necklace back.",
            "He's wrong for getting pissed off and yelling at you for not keeping the present, but honestly, I think you're also wrong for not giving him the present. Even if you thought he wasn't going to give you one, I think the better idea would've been to give him his presents, say you hope he enjoys them, and if he doesn't believe in present giving on Christmas, then that's fine, but that's a serious compatibility issue. It would've been a nicer thing to do. \n\nAt this point, your best bet is to apologize for not considering giving him the gift anyway, but his reaction is inappropriate. Then have a discussion about that. ",
            "> He begins to scream about how I'm an ungrateful cow.\n\nHey /r/relationships haters, you wanna know why we always advise people to break up? Because of this shit, right here. ",
            "Um...this just sounds a bit crazy. There were better ways to do this prank, and he took it a bit too far. I would reevaluate this relationship.",
            "What the fuck is wrong with both of you?",
            "So much gaslighting.  I'd dump his ass.",
            "Dude is a fucking nutcase. Who argues with their SO for 4 hours as part of a \"surprise\" for them? What an insane level of disrespect.",
            "Your \"boyfriend\" is living in a fantasy world where evryone thinks about him, him alone, and dotes on him hand and foot. Of course he doesn't have to reciprocate. He's the center of his universe, he buys gifts as an exception while expecting everyone will bring him gifts as a rule.\n\nReturn the necklace. Don't even think about getting him anything. I'd not contact him either. Wait for a much deserved apology first. If it doesn't show up with a bow on it in two weeks, consider the relationship you had with this man child over. What a weird dude.",
            "You're both messed the fuck up. Return the gift. Everyone's written enough about your boyfriend's crazy behavior, but you... you argued for four hours about the fact that someone doesn't like to give you gifts for Christmas. And then you took the necklace and wrote a cutesy :p about it. Frankly you sound like you're obsessed with getting gifts. ",
            "Give back the necklace.  Your (ex) boyfriend is crazy.  Also, I personally don't give gifts because I hope to get something in return.  If my wife decided she wasn't giving me anything for Christmas, I would still be glad to give her the gifts I bought for her; although I would be a bit disappointed I didn't get anything from her; I have no problem showering myself with gifts :D\n\nGood luck",
            "I know people yell break up a lot here, but I mean really, I think I'll actually be disappointed in you if you post any more updates that aren't you telling him you're through, with a clear explanation to him why. Give him the necklace back while you do it.",
            "This is perfect!  Go buy him a nice gift, wrap it up very nicely.\n\nTell him that you told him he wasn't getting a gift because you really wanted it to be a surprise!  That his ruse was so well played that you wanted to play too!\n\nInstead of reindeer games, be wants to play mind games and that works both ways.  How could he possibly be mad since it was his idea?\n\nJust a thought.",
            ">He gets really mad, saying I should have kept the present for him because in the end he did get me something. But how was I supposed to know that?!\n\nIndeed. Instead of making even a half-assed attempt to communicate with you, he flat out lied to your face, explicitly told you he was absolutely, positively, never, ever, ever going to get you a Christmas gift. And then, he gets pissed at you because you believed him?\n\nYour boyfriend sucks. He's playing head games, plain and simple. Back forever ago when you guys first had the conversation about Christmas, a reasonable person would have told you, \"I'm not a fan of Christmas, but it's clear that it's important to you so I will get you a gift.\" \n\nInstead, he lied to you, made you feel like crap, and now blames you for believing him when he told you he'd rather die than buy you a present. That's immature, manipulative bullshit, OP.",
            "If it takes his mom coming into his room to tell him to stop yelling at you, take this as your chance to run. If you DON'T want to take this chance to run, then stop calling him. What did you do wrong, exactly? Take him at his word? Believed him when he told you he wanted no presents and did not plan on getting you any? What exactly do you have to apologize for?  And is this how amped up he gets during any sort of fight or confrontation?  \n\n\nHe sounds crazier than a bag of cats. Don't let him ruin your holiday",
            "I'd be so done with this joker, but I have no time for mind games. \n\nHe's just fucking with you because it makes him feel important. Get rid of the necklace (doesn't matter how) and keep the games. You'll be better off without this guy in your life... he's obviously really messed up and needs to get himself right before being involved with other people. ",
            "Wow, I went into this ready to (gently) defend the boyfriend, because I stopped exchanging gifts a long time ago.  But all that seems really bizarre!  Guy seems real confused, to say the least.",
            "Holy mind games.  What a nut job.",
            "I really don't understand what compelling reason you have for staying with this weird, selfish man-child who plays head-games with you for no reason.\n\nIf he's already acting this crazy at month 10, imagine how nuts he'll be if you're still with him when year 10 rolls around.",
            "Does it get any more obvious that you need to break up with this person? And probably not date for a while and work on yourself. \n\nI should just make a bot to post this to every /r/relationships post. ",
            "that's less of a surprise and more of a prank.  This guy is an idiot.",
            "Jesus. Who wants that kind of unnecessary drama in their lives.",
            "If that was my gf, she'd have ruined my Christmas. Unless his parents can teach him a big lesson in the next few days and he apologizes, it might be best to let this guy go. If you've been with him more than, say, 8 months, maybe give him a bit more time, like until new year's.\n\nIf he cannot find it in himself to apologize, it's okay to let him go.",
            "This guy is a complete lunatic. I would return the gift to his parents and never contact or respond to him again. He is acting unstable and frankly seems a little dangerous.\n\nCut off all communication.",
            "What a rollercoaster of emotions reading this update was!\n\nYour bf is being unreasonable. But if you still wanna forgive him and be with him, do buy him a present. Hopefully with time he'd get over this.",
            "Could you ever trust anything he says again?\n\nNo.\n\nNo basis for a relationship here.",
            "This reminds me of the time my boyfriend changed his number, told me it was because I creeped him out and didn't want me contacting me anymore. Lasted about 2 hours (it took awhile for the number to change because of technical problems), then he calls from the new number and was like, I lost a bet and had to change my number...\n\nHe was more panicked than me by that point.
