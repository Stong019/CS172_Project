        "selftext": "Update to my post here https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4eftot/my_30m_dog_1m_ate_all_of_my_girlfriends_25f_shoes/\n\n\nI am getting a surprising number of PMs asking for an update so here it is. The general consensus from my first post was that I should buy a few key pairs before she gets home so I decided to go with that. It was hard because where we live we are transitioning from winter to summer so I had to buy winter boots, rain boots, sandals, runners, and various types of work shoes. Only about half of them arrived before she got home on Friday. I wish I could have bought them in person so I could have been certain they would be here, but I wasn\u2019t able to since winter stuff is out of season and lots of the brands she likes are only available online.\n \n\nFriday I picked her and her friends up from the airport. When we got a second of alone time I told her about the shoe situation. She was pissed initially. She wasn\u2019t mad at me or our dog but more mad that it happened. I decided not to tell her about the awesome closet that I built her while she was gone and just hoped that the surprise would soften the blow. On the car ride back she told her friends what happened and they really helped turn it into a positive event that she could laugh about. She would only get sad when she remembered shoes that she spent a long time breaking in. Apparently her Birkenstocks took two full summers before they reached max comfiness so that was what she was the most sad about, I feel fucking awful about that. I actually took those ones to a cobbler because I KNEW she would be most upset about them but they couldn\u2019t be salvaged, they were too far gone. \n\n\nWhen we got home she wanted to see the carnage. I wasn\u2019t sure it was a good idea because I was kind of expecting her to cry but she just thought it was funny. She had me make a small pine casket for the shoes while her and her friends got absolutely blasted and we buried them in the backyard that night. She did cry briefly at the funeral but she was a trooper nonetheless. Her friends decided it was only fair for me to purchase every pair of shoes she wants for the rest of our lives and I drunkenly agreed, a decision that I\u2019m sure will cost me a small fortune, but I stand by it all the same. \n\n\nOver the past few days she has ordered all of the shoes she needed to replace the ones she lost. She only re-ordered around 10 pairs that she previously owned, so it was a good thing I didn\u2019t go ahead and re-order them all. She already had a Pinterest of every pair she wanted and had deemed to be worthy of her collection which made it was a fairly quick process. All in all, it cost around twice what I had anticipated but she didn\u2019t break up with me so I\u2019ll call it a win. I\u2019m just glad I was able to afford it, I couldn\u2019t imagine how awful it would be to be in this position without being able to pony up. It\u2019s going to set me back a few months on buying an engagement ring but I\u2019m sure that won\u2019t be an issue. \n\n\nFor everyone concerned about the dog, she isn\u2019t worried about getting him trained more because he behaves perfectly otherwise. She said if anything, I need to be trained not to be a careless idiot. Joking aside, it was a fluke and we\u2019re usually very good about keeping the shoes put away. I made the doors to her closet and our front closet self-closing so we don\u2019t ever need to worry about leaving them open. Like my girlfriend, the poor guy can\u2019t resist shoes so we don\u2019t really blame him for what happened, in fact we are quite proud of what he managed to accomplish in the 12 hours I was away. \n\n\n**tl;dr**: everything went better than expected, my girlfriend is cool as a cucumber",

        "selftext": "I [34F] got married to my boyfriend Dan [35M]. We have been together for 5 years now. We have been married two months now.\n\nDan has two siblings. Moira [32F] is great, I love her like my own sister. Smith [30M] is kind of a weird character. He is fun, in small doses. I am not annoyed with him so much as perplexed. He seems stuck in middle school. \n\nMy wedding had a lot of small problems. I had a kid throw up on my dress, so I wore my MOH's dress while she changed into her street clothes. I tripped going up the stairs. Dan dropped his ring down the vent. One of my cousin's children knocked over a pile of cupcakes. For the most part, no one did anything on purpose and we have it on tape, which is hilarious. \n\nThere was one incident that felt intentionally done to make my day harder for me. It was done by Smith. During the actual vows, when the priest [60sM] asked if anyone protests, forever hold your peace, Smith stood up. He said he was in love with me and didn't think I should marry his brother. Then after a few seconds of silence, he said 'wrong wedding' and walked out. I could hear him laughing about it. \n\nI have a little brother [25M] who was prone to stupid shit like this when he was 11. I have learned not to take it personally, I work with kids. I am used to Smith. I just felt it was stupid and made him look bad more than me. I didn't want it in the video and asked the videographer to take it out. I didn't bring it up again, I let Dan handle his family like we have agreed. I think he spoke to Smith about it, I know my MIL [60s] gave him a stern once over.\n\nI let it go. I didn't really think about it much until we got the video and pictures. Smith was over while my cousin Cindy [40F] was. Cindy asked to see the video and pictures. I turned it on, showed her the video. It was hilarious. It was loving and beautiful. It also didn't have Smith doing something stupid. \n\nSmith got upset about it and said we kept all the other bad stuff, why not him. He was part of the wedding excitement. He was funny. Why didn't we keep it in? \n\nI told him I didn't think it was very funny, he did it to piss us off, and I didn't want it in my video. I said no hard feelings, it wasn't funny is all. \n\nSmith left and is actually upset about this. He has been texting Dan saying how I changed him, blah blah.\n\nI am just not sure how to go forward from this. I feel like I am dealing with a toddler. How do I explain to Smith that he could have ruined my wedding, and most women would have flayed him alive and told him to never come into their home? I feel he owes me an apology, but don't really care that Smith thinks he is funny. I just don't want to deal with hissy fits. So what do I do? \n\n\n**TL;DR** BIL made a stupid joke during my wedding vows and is upset the guy edited it out. NOt sure what is up? \n\n\n",

            "What an intense idiot! Holy crap, he really thought that was funny?\n\nYou keep doing what you've been doing so far: Let your husband deal with his family.\n\nTell your husband how you feel, and that you need this adressed with his brother.",
            "He wants attention, don't give it to him. Ignore completely.",
            "The difference between the two is that he did this to purposely be recorded, to purposely be a part of your day. Everything else was an accident that's just a silly addition to the day and the memories. That's what he needs to understand.",
            "You literally couldn't have handled this with more calmness or grace. I was amazed while reading this how cool headed you were and are being about it - I can't say I would've done the same.\n\nI honestly think you should trust your gut - if Smith continues to sulk, point out to him how you're just trying to move on and \"you're lucky I'm not freaking out about this and demanding an apology, which I deserve by the way\". You didn't find it funny, he has to get over himself and chalk it up to a loss. It seems pretty clear everyone in his family agrees with you that it was dumb? He'll have to sit with that knowledge and get over himself.",
            "> Smith got upset about it and said we kept all the other bad stuff, why not him.\n\nBecause all the other stuff was *accidental*. No one planned for the kid to throw up on your dress, or for Dan to drop his ring, or for the other kids to knock over the cupcakes. \n\nSmith had some stupid idea of interrupting your vows for a laugh, and probably thought the joke was sooooooooo clever. My guess is that not a single other person laughed, did they? It was just an awkward interruption to make him the centre of attention for a minute.\n\nIt looks like you've already explained this to him, so just treat him as you would a two-year-old. Ignore him, ignore his hissy fits, ignore his attempts to be the centre of attention.  ",
            ">I let it go.\n\nYou are a queen among women. \n\nJust ignore him.",
            "If he wanted to keep that moment (of trying to ruin your wedding and looking like an ass) for posterity, he should have hired his own videographer and paid for it.  As it is, it's your and your husband's video of your wedding, and the two of you had the right to edit it however you wanted.\n\nI would tell your husband to talk with the BIL, if he keeps sulking and acting like you've done something to him.  He sounds like a big baby who wants to be the center of attention at all times, he just has to deal with not getting his way.",
            "He's an idiot, I'd like your husband deal with him like you did at the wedding.\n\nWith that said, I'm SHOCKED you think someone puking on your dress and you wearing your MOH's dress is a \"small problem.\" You are clearly the most chill bride of all time, haha. Also, how bad did that kid's mom feel?",
            "I am assuming your husband pretty much agrees with your piont of view? If let him deal with Smith and now you know how he will be for any other big events, he is insecure and he created drama to shift the attention back to him. I think he is somewhat jealous of your husband.",
            "Your patience and grace are unimaginable to me. You seem like a pretty incredible person. ",
            "He honestly sounds like an idiot instead of an asshole. Like he was trying to make you laugh.\n\n\nIf you guys do anything, your husband needs to sit him down and give him some real talk. That it wasn't personal, but that what he did was really immature, vows are important to people, and 99% of people would not have found that funny, in fact, most would be pissed.  He kind of needs to be talked to like the 11 year old he acts like. \n\n\nYou guys seem to handle everything well...congratulations on the wedding!\n\n\nExcuse me while I go panic about the idea of a kid puking on my wedding dress....",
            "I'm assuming no one laughed but him, so it's weird he'd want his bombing to be preserved forever. ",

            "\"Smith, this wedding was a one-time, very important event for [Dan] and [me]. We intend to be together for the rest of our lives, so it's not like there would ever be a do-over. I thought we had a good relationship, but based on what you did, I'm not sure that you care that much about [me] very much at all. Is that really the way you feel?\" \n\nThis is my lawyer-lady diplomatic response, my gut response was: BURN HIM. Also - you're not married to Smith, so eff Smith. Whew, okay, I feel better.",
            "You just let that go?! Wow you are a saint! You've already handled this admirably. Let idiots be idiots. Funny enough in Canada, pulling a stunt like that at a Wedding is a Criminal Offence \"Disturbing Religious Worship or Certain Meetings\", not sure which country you are in, but there's a chance that he actually committed a crime for a few luls. So no, it isn't funny, and I don't blame you for taking it out of your video. Just keep ignoring him.",
            "What a fucking brat. Unacceptable behavior at 30yo. God, I'm sorry, it's just disguising, and for him to get mad about it beats all I've ever seen. I'd be cautious inviting him to any more important events. ",
            "Note to self: don't invite children to wedding.\n\nOnto the actual advice: you've been remarkably graceful about this whole thing, but it's time for you and your husband to stop engaging with Smith. The whole thing is frankly pathetic and more than a little concerning that he still behaves this way at his age. He tried to make your wedding and vows about *him* and now he's salty that you handled it as you saw fit. \n\nDo not under any circumstances apologize. Continue to let your husband handle his family. ",
            "I think \"hahahahaha\" is a valid reply to Smith. \nSeriously, if your husband is siding with you, just let Smith have his tantrum. No amount of explaining will work because he probably doesn't want to understand it and it just further buys into his attention seeking. Given the type of person he seems to be you probably won't get an apology, and it honestly wouldn't be the hill I'd die on if he makes it more dramatic within the family. Just let it blow over, and deal with his hissy fits like you would a toddler's: ignoring them. ",
            "How is this guy 30??  He sounds like an attention seeking brat.  \n\nI tend to believe each SO should deal with their own families, so I think it's your husband's job here to ride herd on his brother. But honestly, I don't think you should do much \"explaining\" here.  At this point, Smith either understands that he fucked up and is doubling down because he can't admit it, or he really is so far up his own ass that he doesn't get it.  Your comparison to a toddler is a good one... don't reward the tantrum with attention, don't let him think he can make you justify yourselves if he just throws a big enough fit.\n\nIf your husband does talk to his brother, it's imperative that he NOT frame it as \"you upset my wife\" but rather \"you upset *us* and made a really uncool joke at a wedding we spent X amount of time and money putting together.\"   Your BIL needs to hear that this is coming from Dan as much as, if not more than, you.  But honestly, I'm not sure Smith is worth even that much of a conversation.",
            "Smith's got zero validity. He tried to usurp your day with his joke, and is now upset that you didn't let him. He also apparently can't tell the difference between legitimate accidents and deliberate befuckery, or figure out why you might want to remember one and not the other.\n\nJust don't engage with him on this, because there's no \"winning\" with someone who is on the kind of ego trip he's on. Don't defend yourself, don't rationalize, don't justify, just flat out don't talk to him about it. It takes two to tango. He can try to create all the drama he wants but it'll go nowhere if you refuse to play.\n\n",
            "He's mad about the video? He's lucky he wasn't dragged out of the church by his ankles, barely conscious. He got off easy. ",
            "If he's not a good old fashioned run of the mill idiot then he is someone who thrives on attention. What sane person disrupts a wedding for shits and giggles?! Let Dan deal with him. Don't acknowledge his tantrum, don't expect an apology cuz you ain't gonna get one, pretend his butthurtery never happened and pretend like everything is normal, the only way to \"win\" with attention seekers is not to play. ",
            ">I feel like I am dealing with a toddler                \n\nYou are. Respond as such. Just as if one of the kids you work with was throwing a tantrum.",
            "He wanted the attention focused on him during your actual wedding ceremony, and clearly didn't care about your comfort or happiness then (accentuated by the fact that he walked out following his stunt and didn't care to watch his brother get married!), so why do you think he would feel any differently about the wedding video? He is the problem, not you. I'm guessing he does attention grabbing stunts all the time, not just with you, and while your husband might have gone along with it when they were younger, he's grown up a bit since then but Smith hasn't. If you want to try to address it, discuss with your husband first and then maybe ask Smith to coffee and an overreaching conversation about wanting to connect with him on a personal level, and get beyond this joking pull your pigtails stuff he's currently relying on for personal attention and connection. ",
            "Does anyone ever outright TELL these douche-aircraft carriers that they're doing it for attention because they think the universe should revolve around them? I mean in those words.\n\nBecause rolling your eyes at them and telling them off without saying those words DOESN'T GET THE MESSAGE THROUGH. ",
            "Just ignore him.  Like a toddler, any attention is simply rewarding him.\n\nIf he has really never apologised for what happened I'm amazed you let him come to your home... but it sounds more like Dan's failure to stand up to him or set proper boundaries that is the issue.",
            "Next time, keep a pacifier in your purse, and when he starts again, offer it to him for self soothing.\n\nIf he is acting like a baby, treat him like one. \n\nI mean, he won't mind it because it's funny, right? Just like he expected you not to mind his 'joke'.",
            "Just remind him no one was laughing but him, which means it wasn't funny.",
            "\"I'm truly sorry for the hardship you've suffered from me removing you from our video, please accept this  $500 dollars as token of my thanks for your inclusion in our wedding day. \n\n\nOh, sorry, wrong apology\". ",
            "Never wrestle with a pig, you both get muddy and that pig likes it. Ie. You cant reason with a toddler. Its my understanding that if someone speaks at that point in a wedding in the UK, joke or not the wedding has to stop. Or maybe that is an urban myth.  You handled this with grace, he is a plonker.",
            "Honestly this is exactly why most ministers won't do that part of the wedding now.  It isn't funny, and it just goes to show how immature your BiL is.  Don't do anything. This is a way to try and get attention, just ignore him or have your husband deal with him. Also to be honest you are dealing with a toddler like mentality.",
            "Tell him that you had it removed because it was an attempt to ruin the wedding. If he retorts about the other incidents, tell him \"No, those were accidents. They were not a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from me and husband, *your* stunt was. It was all about you, on a day that was supposed to be about US. This wasn't an audition tape for your comedy routine, it was our wedding. Something we only get once.

I don't want your stupidity memorialized on MY wedding video.  You are free to ask the video service to make you your own copy since you seem to think you played a starring role.\"",
            "Classic case of someone who, as my father used to describe it: ' has to be the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral'.",
            "He's probably just embarrassed that his hilarious prank went over like a lead balloon. He might have even been planning it for days expecting a better response. Since it was just 2 months ago, learning that you cut it from the video reopened his raw wound a little. Lashing out at your husband / his brother was just to ease his pain. That doesn't make it right, but that's why he did it.\n\nAs an isolated incident, this isn't that bad. Just wait for it to blow over on its own. You sound over the actual stunt anyway, no reason to rehash it any more than that. Hopefully after this fallout your BIL learns that his juvenile tendencies don't go over so well with you guys. Maybe he doesn't, and then you revisit this issue in the future if it builds to unbearable levels.",
            "Holy shit this sounds just like my dad. He loves telling jokes, making people laugh, no matter how dumb he looks or if it hurts anyones feelings, his main goal is to get a laugh and he will try as hard as possible to get it. When we don't laugh or when we don't find it funny or get our feelings hurt, he gets very sensitive and huffy. \n\nAt first I would always laugh because I felt bad and didn't want him to react the way he usually does. But now, I ignore him or act like I didn't hear him and if he reacts that way I still just don't say anything. Because why should I change the way I act around someone that I not only care and love about, but should be doing the same to me. \n\nIf this situation happened to me, I don't think I could ignore it simply because that was MY day and NOT his and he did not need to interrupt like that.\n\n I think you should let him know it hurt you, or at least made you upset, and talk with him about it like adults one on one. If anyone else is in the room he might throw a fit (like my dad does) to see if anyone is on his side and get even more angry to see no one is. So keep it between you two. I'm sure it will blow over after that.",
            "This brings back memories. Something very similar happened when my father got married for the second time. One of my uncles also decided to jokingly (and loudly) protest. \n\nIt's been 25 years since then, and it still gets brought up every now and then, but never by my uncle (who has since passed). Thankfully there were no video cameras around back then for the wedding. \n\n\nI think you should have your husband have a talk with his brother again and explain that there are limits to how far you carry a joke, and that while he may have found it funny, the two of you did not, and you would rather not have the reminder whenever you watch the video.\n\nYou can also mention that there is a clear difference between the other accidents and his intentional joke.\n\nIf he doesn't respond to you with an apology along the lines of \"I'm sorry. I thought it would be funny, but I guess I hadn't quite thought about how you might feel\", well then to hell with him. He clearly doesn't care about your feelings at all.\n",

I've heard tales of the bride and groom going no contact with people for things as small as wearing the wrong dress to their wedding. \n\nYour BIL sounds like an absolute child. He did it for attention, and now he's upset because you didn't let him get his way and took his pathetic, tasteless joke out of your videos, denying him attention in the future. When he tells Dan you've 'changed him', he's saying 'you're not enabling my jokes now!' \n\nHow you proceed is up to you. If I was in your shoes, I'd ask Dan to text him a verbal smackdown, but that's probably more my style then yours. It may benefit y'all to just ignore him.

It may require patience.  It may or may not be necessary;   there's no way from to tell to what extent Smith's family has enabled or encouraged his behaviour, or to what extent Smith is simply like that and suffers because of it.\n\nIn this scenario, its possible that Smith is genuinely hurt at the moment because the other funny stuff stayed in and the funny scene he made was edited out.  The thing to note here is that *your* feelings about *your* wedding would be a vague, fluttering notion like a moth on the very edge of his awareness.  He'd sort of know but not really, and it would pale in comparison to the excitement of his idea.  He would be firmly rooted as the immovable axis around which Smith's World revolves.  So telling him things like \"he did it to piss us off\" and \"you tried to ruin my wedding\" might not get through to him, if it didn't seem fair, because it wasn't true.\n\nWhere things get icky and messy is the question of how Smith's World stays safely fixed on its axis, what sort of rationalizations Smith is willing to make to keep it there, and what sort of person Smith the toddler is really like.  \n\nBeing firm but calm, being willing to explain things clearly and more than once, and giving Smith the benefit of the doubt in terms of what you think was actually going on in his head might be a good idea for the time being.  He might be distressed by the change in his relationship with his brother.  He might adjust.\n\nIn this scenario, and in all others, expect that Smith has succeeded to an extent in getting his family, and friends if he has any, to conform to his behaviour as if it was a complete disability and he had no choice but to act as he does.

        "selftext": "My nephew is turning ten and is really into minecraft.  He has played with the lego sets since he was little and even reads the books about minecraft adventures (I didn't know that was a thing!).  The only time my nephew was able to play was on my mother's tablet every once in a great while because my brother uses his laptop for work.  \n\nI was presented with an opportunity to get a used laptop for $100.  It's not a gaming laptop by any means, but it will play minecraft just fine.  Before I bought it, I spoke with my brother and told him that I wanted to buy the laptop so that my nephew would have something to do homework on but also so he could play minecraft.  He agreed and so I bought the laptop.  I spent some time setting it up, installing minecraft and other stuff like antivirus so that it was safe for him.  I gave it to my brother last fall.  \n\nFast forward to just recently when I was watching my nephew for the evening.  He said he wanted to play minecraft on my computer so I agreed.  I asked him what he liked to do in minecraft, what types of things he liked to build, but he said he never got to play.  Confused, I asked why not.  He said that they didn't have a computer for him to play on.  At this point I was already pretty certain of what had happened, but I didn't want to throw my brother under the bus.  I asked if he could use his dad's laptop to play on.  He said, \"Well, his black one has it installed, but that's always at work.  His silver one is too old and slow.\"  The black laptop, is the one that I gave my brother.  \n\nI'm pissed.  I never would have spent $100 to buy my brother a laptop.  I just wanted to do something nice for my nephew. \n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: I bought a laptop for my nephew to use but my brother kept it for himself instead.  \n\nAm I wrong to be upset? I understand that he is the parent but I feel taken advantage of.  I'm pretty sure I already know the answer to this, but would it be out of line for me to demand that he either give it to my nephew or give it back? \n\nEdit: Holy shit.  I responded to the first couple of people that responded and thought that was the end of this, so I went to bed.  I never expected this post to get so much attention.  I'll never be able to respond to everyone, but I'll try and respond to the highest comments.  I'll update later if/when I confront my brother. ",

But unfortunately, even though he is totally in the wrong, you have to tread carefully so that he doesn't end up vindictive.

Your brother does not sound like the kind of person who will admit to a mistake when confronted. He also sounds like he may be the kind of person who withholds contact with your nephew as punishment. In my opinion, it's not worth the risk to confront him. \n\nYour brother sucks. He took advantage of your generosity. Take this as a hard lesson. Anything you give your nephew, you give directly to him from now on. No middle man. \n\nIf you want, a simple \"I guess that that laptop I gave nephew didn't work out, huh? That's too bad, he was telling me the other day how much he loves playing Minecraft, but he's never had a computer to play on. So weird, that machine looked like it was in pretty good shape.\"\n\nIf you're brother has any brain at all, that statement will tell him you know he never gave your nephew the computer, and also guilts him a bit. But also isn't aggressive, so hopefully won't have any negative repercussions for your nephew. \n\nAnyway, just my opinion. From an Aunt who would be devastated if I couldn't hang out with my niece.

My girlfriend has a father who has stole literal thousands from her before she was 18 (she had a job).\n\nHer grandpa (on her father's side, he doesn't like his son (her father)) sent her a $2,000 check to pay for her new car she bought with her own cash because the grandpa decided he wanted to be the one who bought her a car. Her father cashes the check and spends it, never giving it to her or talking to her about it. That was the single most expensive thing he's done, but he does other things too. He bought her a new car radio for Christmas, but after he tried it out he started driving her car to work (he has a 1hr commute) and using her gas and refused to pay for her gas. He has a car, but she doesn't like to use it because he trashed it (he smokes inside it, leaves empty fast food bags, etc). \n\nAnyway, that kinda devolved into a rant, but here's the intended takeaway: I don't know your brother, but letting him get away with taking your nephew's stuff sets a bad precedent. If you confront him, if he's anything like my girlfriends dad (and I don't know him, so I can't say he is), he will get angry and deny everything and either play victim or just get verbally abusive. \n\nI don't know your family and I hope this isn't the case, but I just wanted to put that out there.

If you gave me a new laptop, I could see myself using it and handing down my old one for my kid to play with (provided it fulfilled the stated goal of permitting him to play his game, which is kind of uncertain here)\n\nIf you wanted to give the machine to the boy, you should explain the mix-up and make sure it becomes his ... or figure out what's keeping the silver one from playing the game and suggest a fix. Few functioning machines can't play Minecraft. \n\nI know this is contrary to all these other posts, and I get it is weird when a gift is used differently than you exactly intended, but if you gave the gift to the father, it is his to adjust his own household's technology allocation. \n\nLike buying a bigger TV so the kids have one of their own and moving the old one into their room, or a better phone to make sure everyone in the family has one. \n\nIt's wicked unfair if you had been explicit about who the intended user was, and maybe you were careless about how you chose words, but the recipient of a gift chooses how it is used, and perhaps there is more to this than meets the eye.

First off I wanted to say thank you for all the comments, they were super insightful for me. \n\nFeel free to see my last post for context: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/e008nu/i_f26_have_been_having_intense_sexual_dreams/\n\nI just wanted to give an update on the situation and maybe a bit more background to the situation. \n\nSo I recently broke off my ldr of 4,5 years. For a long time I had been coming to terms with the fact that I can't see a future together for the two of us, even though he had been talking about marriage and proposing for ages. There were many things happening in this relationship that added up made me realise that is not something I want to pursue forever. This relationship hadn't been doing it for me emotionally und sexually for quite some time. \n\nMy flatmate and I have been part of a close knit clique for around ten years. For seven of those years he had been in a relationship with another girl from the clique. It turned long distance quite some time ago and didn't work out. They broke it off at the beginning of this year. They talked about how they want to go forward from this and vowed to tell each other about potential new first partners. She has been sleeping around for some time and not directly talked about it with him. \n\nSo after we went drinking and went home we spent some time talking, the topic turned to my birth control situation, the frustration and dreams. At one point he told me to come over to his side of the sofa and asked me if I was talking about him. It was pretty surreal for the both of us I guess. Since then we have been pretty much inseparable, laying around on each other, making out and what not. I feel so happy at the moment and he does too. We have also been doing a lot of talking and being honest with each other. \n\nHe says he wants to hold off on having actual sex, until he's sure he wants to pursue a relationship with me, because he doesn't want anything casual. Of course at this point in time is too early to say if it will work out, but that's OK. I want to see where it goes as I haven't been this genuinely happy in a long time, and I'm so glad he feels the same way. We're concerned about what the rest of the clique will say and how they react once it gets out. Truly a sticky situation. \n\nI'm ready to see if it works out and I'm ready to commit. I can sincerely say that he is not the reason I broke of my last relationship, but I can understand how it can seem that way. Of course the way we worked together did show me many parts of my last relationship that I was absolutely not happy about. \n\nTl;DR it all kinda worked out. We feel the same way about each other and life is good.",

            "I was in a situation very similar to this (long time friend became house share became dating)\n\n3 years later me and the person are married. Not saying it always works like that, but there's nothing inherently wrong with dating a flatmate. I think the taboo comes more from college dorm situations and doesnt really apply to independent adults pushing 30.\n\nAfter a decade of friendship you know each other well, and being roommates you've already seen them when they're sick, on laundry day, resolved issues over housework. It's actually a great trial run for a relationship, imo \n\nThat said just **tread carefully, use your best judgment, and KEEP YOUR SAME SEPARATE ROOMS** \n\nAnyway good luck (:",
            "If youre both happy, your clique will support it. Or you need a new clique.",
            "Doesn\u2019t sound like a particularly sticky situation to me, other than the fact that you live together. I\u2019m confused about why he and his ex vowed to tell each other about new partners? That level of involvement with an ex is odd.",
            "The native American's have a wampum belt that is two horizontal lines. One representing Americans, the other, Natives. Both are walking through life, side by side, as friends, companions, but the lines never cross. Separate but a similar path. \n\nRelationships that make it often have this similar strategy for themselves. Both people are truly individuals, with individual interests, desires, and goals, and yet they walk together, sharing common goals and a common future. \n\nRelationships that fail, often do because one person grows faster or slower than the other, or the people and their respective lives become like one, and they become bored with one another (a single line), or they grow completely apart (lines expanding apart). To have two lines, side by side, it represents a healthy relationship in life, and balance. \n\nAt this point in your life, both you and he are walking VERY similar lines in life, and there are many pros and cons. Pros are you know each other and are living together. Con is you are 'too close' to the point where if you have 'issues' it can rock the social group, and give both of you 'nobody outside to talk to' about relationship issues. The lines, might be too close. \n\nAs with all relationships, I truly wish you and he the very best. I think it's great that you feel this way, and are taking things one day at a time. I truly hope a year from now you are on the path to having children and marriage.",

            "Sorry if I'm being rude, but it doesn't seem like a good idea to bang your flatmate, and him not being sure of wanting a relationship isn't a good start. I'd start making a backup plan for if things go south.",
            "Remember. You find people attractive the more you see them. Be honest. Be aware.",
            "Y'all are two consenting adults who broke off with their other parents before persuing one another. \n\nWhat's the big deal? \n\nYou're not at the age that you cannot live without friends anymore. Do whatever makes you happy, and if it means being together makes you both happy, a total win win.",
            "Enjoy the NRE.  Dont think about committing for at least 6 months, give those chemicals a chance to calm down.  The proximity and convenience can be so alluring.",
            "You've known this guy for ten years, you have lived together for part of that time, and he still doesn't know if he wants a relationship with you? This relationship would be so convenient for him, and yet he still doesn't want it.\n\nThis isn't going to work out.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that you probably have to move now if you want to date anyone else because no guy is going to want any part of this situation. A woman with a male roommate raises an eyebrow, but knowing you have made out with that roommate is going to push everyone else away.",
            "Be cautious. Don't shit where you eat. If this relationship doesn't go as you expect it, you still have to live with him. If you want to date and explore a relationship, I would suggest one of you moving out. You would never start dating someone and instantly move in with them, even if you've known them for a decade. This isn't much different from that.",

            "This is so wild because almost the exact same thing has happened to me recently - I came off hormonal birth control, started seeing my friend who I share a flat and close friendship group with in a whole new light, and after a conversation about my experiences with coming off birth control he told me he had feelings for me too. Bonus points for the similarity in that his ex is in our social group too. This happened a couple of months ago now, we\u2019re together, and it is going so wonderfully. Good to start slow, especially when you live with someone, because that puts a massive acceleration on some aspects of the relationship which you just can\u2019t help. Good luck and congratulations OP.",
            "I am very happy to see that you didn\u2019t decide to ignore your feelings. I\u2019m happy to see you didn\u2019t suppress your needs or have empty flings. \n\nI\u2019m happy to see you had the courage to reach out to him.",
            "AMAZING. I was hoping this was the outcome, he sounds wonderful so don't let him or you down. Best of luck!",
            "This was the end you deserve and it is both a relieve and a good news! I wish you the best for both of you!",
            "This is almost exactly the situation I was in 3 years ago. We both recently ended our 2+ years relationships and then we kind of made out at a NYE party. I took a train home and she stayed to see her family for a few days. When she came back, we were both gauging how we feel about it to not pressure another person and ruin the nice thing we were having. The agreement was to keep it casual just in case it doesn't work out. Two months into hookups and spending lots of time together and we realized there's nothing casual about this. Still going strong three years ago, it all worked out.\n\nGood luck!",
            "Sounds like with your update, the potential for something more is possible. So I guess as long as you keep in mind that pushing too hard might upset this current idyll, then good things might just turn especially great",
