        "selftext": "[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3jx8k1/a_close_friend_has_annonomously_posted_gory/)\n\nI've been putting off writing this update for a few days, the thought of it makes me nauseous but i think you all deserve a follow up after helping me threw this. I'll start by saying the person this been caught, i'll lead up the details.\n\nIn the original post i made an small update that I was setting a trap on Facebook by posting multiple photo that were slightly different and only visible to certain groups. Unfortunately this did not work because Literotica removed this posts and the account, i'm happy its gone but i didn't have another way to find out. I tried pushing it out of my mind and took a break from social media, also my cousin Dan (police officer M/27) moved in with after this and it really helped me feel safe.\n\nFor about three weeks I didn't go out aside from work and errands, put off friends who (at the time) didn't know why. I figured it was easier to shut out everyone until i was more comfortable. By this point I just accepted that it was a fucked up prank or someone else using a friends account and that i needed to move on. \n\nOut of the blue I get a visit from a girl Lorrie, I know her as the off-on girlfriend of David (M/34) although this was my first time meeting or speaking to her. David was like a \"big brother\" to my cousin Dan; when Dan moved to LA David let him stay with him until he got a job, David helped him get his first car, David introduced him to his ex-wife and later helped him through the divorce. I always saw him as the nice guy that helped Dan and I through rough times. \n\nLorrie is crying and having a breakdown on my porch, I couldn't make out a word she was saying through the wheezing and sobbing. She calms down a bit and says she's called the cops on David. Then she told me everything. She had been getting into fights with him after he kept talking about me, bringing me up at inappropriate times. She was convinced he was cheating on her and she looked threw his laptop hoping to find photos or messages. She found screenshots of Literotica stories, the photoshopped pictures, and a collection of child pornography videos.\n\nMy heart breaks just typing this, how can people be so fucking disgusting. He has a 4 year old daughter, they've found videos of her too. I don't know anything about the arrest other than that he can't afford post bail and called Dan and our friends begging for help after his family said they want nothing to do with him, no one will. \n\nI don't know how to end this, I guess I really hoped this was just a fucked up joke on me but it lead to something so much more miserable. \n\nTL;DR: My cousins mentor and family friend was caught with child pornography and the stories/photos sent to me after his girlfriend searched his computer. He's not making bail. ",

The sadistic creep is clearly capable of doing evil things in real life if he could molest his own daughter.",

I sent her a message saying how uncomfortable last night was for me, that it was not right to rub her friendship with him on my face and how it felt like she valued her relationship with my ex more than our friendship. I told her I can\u2019t dictate who she can be friends with but that I cannot be friends with someone who\u2019s a close friend of that one person who messed me up mentally and emotionally. I wished her the best and blocked her from everywhere. \n\n\nI have known her since we were in grade 4. We lived in the same neighbourhood and went to the same school. We were good friends till high school and eventually drifted apart. My best friend and she used to go to the same college and used to tell how she was clingy with a guy even though she had a boyfriend who went to a different college. I kept away from her and thought I would never be in touch with her but we were friends on Facebook. I finished college and moved to a different country when I learned her father had passed away. I felt really bad and reached out to her. She mentioned she was also moving to the country and we decided to meet up. My boyfriend and I met her for lunch and eventually my boyfriend and her husband became friends. I broke up with my boyfriend and she said how she would have gone after my ex if only she wasn\u2019t married because he\u2019s really cute. I told her what he did to me but it made no difference to her. She had plans of meeting my ex out for dinner and invited me out too. I stopped hanging out with her after that. She kept messaging me to meet quite a few times and I kept making excuses. I finally cave in and planned a dinner with her for today, but she wouldn\u2019t stop talking about my ex. Telling how he is one of her close friends and how they keep sending each other snapchats (like it was a big deal for her). It felt really annoying I cut the dinner short and headed home. I don\u2019t want to be friends with her anymore. How should I tell her that I don\u2019t want to be friends with her without hurting her feelings? How do I stay away from her?\n\nTldr: married friend became close friend of my ex after we broke up and keeps talking about him every time we meet.",

It was just weird like don't be friends with people just so you can stick around for an opening. She was married at the time too. And then ruined her marriage insisting on a sudden open marriage 6 months in and kind of just telling him this is the way it is without asking how he feels. She also like announced her babys godfather was our guy friend from highschool (also married) who she had done the same thing to (\"friendship\" but super one sided and her always trying to flirt/trying to find and opening). Their friendship was already on the rocks when she was pregnant and he expressed she should pick someone else. She insisted and sure enough by the time this kid is 2, the guy from highschool doesn't want to be friends. She's sending him guilt trip messages about \"you never see your godson\". It's fucking weird and exhausting. We are no longer friends because of all her weird behaviour like this. Her dad was an abusive addict so it makes sense she is seeking approval from men.

            "The Powerful Secret To A Loving Relationship\nThere are many factors that go into creating a loving relationship. Certainly it helps if two people have some things in common regarding how they like to spend their time. It also helps if they have common values around religion or spirituality, around politics, the environment, abortion, and personal growth. It helps if they both eat junk food or both eat organic food. It makes things easier if both are neat or both are messy, if both are on time people or both are late people. Physical attraction is also quite important. It\u2019s great if they have common values around money and spending.https://www. digistore24. com /redir/ 302188/ ben2be For more information, click on the link (remove spaces) \n\nYet a couple can have all of these and still not have a loving relationship if one element is missing. Without this essential ingredient, all the other wonderful attributes will not be enough to make the relationship work.\n\nThis essential ingredient is about intention.\n\nAt any given moment, each of us is devoted to only one of two different intentions: to control or to learn. When our intention is to control, our deepest motivation is to have control over getting love, avoiding pain, and feeling safe. When our intention is to learn, our deepest motivation is to learn about being loving to ourselves and others.https://www. digistore24. com /redir/ 302188/ ben2be)For more information, click on the link (remove spaces) \n\nThe motivation to get love rather than be loving can create havoc within a relationship.\n\nLet\u2019s look at a typical relationship issue and see what happens regarding the two different intentions. Jason and Samantha are feeling emotionally distant from each other, and they haven\u2019t made love in a month. The problem started when Samantha stated that she wanted to take an expensive vacation and Jason objected. Samantha got angry, Jason gave in, and they have been distant ever since.https://www. digistore24. com /redir/ 302188/ ben2be)For more information, click on the link (remove spaces) \nSamantha\u2019s intention was to have control over getting what she wanted. She equates an expensive vacation with love \u2013 if Jason does this for her, then he proves his love for her. She used her anger as a way to have control over getting what she wants. She wants control over feeling special to Jason.\n\nJason\u2019s intention is to avoid pain. He gave himself up to have control over Samantha not being angry with him. He hopes that by giving Samantha what she wants, she will see him as a good and loving husband.\n\nHowever, because both Jason and Samantha were trying to control each other rather than be loving to themselves and each other, their interaction created emotional distance.\n\nWhat would this have looked like if their intention had been to learn?\n\nIf Samantha\u2019s intent had been to learn, she would not have become angry. Instead, she would have wanted to understand Jason\u2019s objections. If Jason\u2019s intention had been to learn, he would not have given himself up. Instead he would have wanted to understand why this particular vacation was so important to Samantha. Both Samantha and Jason would have been caring about themselves and each other, rather than wanting to get love or avoid pain. In their mutual exploration about why they each felt the way they did, they would have learned what they needed to learn \u2013 about themselves and each other \u2013 to reach a win-win resolution. Instead of Samantha ostensibly winning and Jason losing, they would have come up with something both of them could live with. With some exploration of his financial fears, Jason might have decided that the vacation Samantha wanted would be fine. With understand of Jason\u2019s financial concerns, Samantha might have decided on a less expensive vacation. In either case, both of them would have felt fine about the outcome.\n\nNo matter how much Jason and Samantha have in common or are attracted to each other, their love will diminish when their intent is to control rather than learn. It\u2019s amazing how quickly love vanishes when one or both partners have the intent to control. It\u2019s equally amazing how fast it comes back when both partners have the intent to learn.\nhttps://www. digistore24. com /redir/ 302188/ ben2be)For more information, click on the link (remove spaces)",

And has possibly been called on it, but with you she feels safe in doing so. OR b) she's having an affair with him and is working her way up to getting you to agree to cover for her when she goes to meet him and is \"softening\" things up by trying to convince you what a great friend he is to her. Something along the lines of, \"I feel awkward asking this, but Ex is having a rough time and wants to meet me, but Hubs has just been soooo jealous lately. Would you cover me if he asks about it?\"\n\nSo it is time to nip that one in the bud - or the butt - whichever you prefer. \n\nAlso stop a second and ask yourself why on earth are you so worried about hurting her feelings when she doesn't give a damned about yours. So if you want to rip the Band-Aid off it's really simple, send her a text along the lines of, \"Friend, I'm going to be honest here - I'm really tired of you going on and on about my ex. It's annoying and more than a little off-putting since you talk about him more than your own husband. So from this point on if we go out you don't say his name at all. If you do I will get up and leave/hang up and that will be the end of the friendship.\" And you enforce it by doing exactly that.\n\nAnd that will likely solve the problem, because with you taking away her cover/excuse to go on and on she won't want to hang out with you anyways. Also do  you really want to be friends with someone that is likely banging your ex or working her way up to it anyways? I'm not seeing any downside to hurting her feelings.\n\nOtherwise I guess you can just ghost her until the end of time by the tried and true method of taking days or even weeks to respond, peppered with a text here and there, \"Sorry, crazy busy, must get together soon!\" rinse and repeat and don't talk to her in person ever. \n\nBut I really have a feeling that won't work. So blunt honesty and enforcing boundaries is the only way to go here. She's not really interested in being your friend anyways.

            "I suggest finding a new therapist. Going to therapy is your safe haven. You're not overreacting. She was under reacting as a therapist. \n\nQuick story. When I was 16, I went to a counselor for an ED (Anorexia). She told me during our second session that I had to eat a cheeseburger in front of her in order for her to \"show me\" it's okay to do, that I wouldn't get fat.\n\nI went home and told my mom, who immediately removed me from her care. I eventually go through recovery, without her help.\n\nSometimes you're just not a right fit. This has nothing to do with you and everything to do with her. Talk to her about how that made you feel and if you don't like her response, find another. There are plenty of great therapists!",
            "Yeah, that was incredibly unprofessional of her and you are absolutely justified for feeling the way you feel.\n\nHowever, if you *really* like working with this therapist, you don't have to fire her just yet. This could be salvageable. You've already got some good advice about calling her outside of your session to sort this out. Definitely do that.\n\nThis might be a bit of an unpopular thing to say considering therapists are there to *help you* and you shouldn't have to worry about their shit...but...I believe there is value in understanding that therapists are people too. People who make mistakes, have an error in judgment, and can sometimes be distracted. Maybe your therapist was having and off day and made a mistake. It happens. \n\nHere's my little anecdote about confronting my therapist who was acting unprofessionally, and we were able to work it out and continue therapy. She was chronically late and had a habit of canceling on me *very* last minute (as in I'd be in the waiting room and she would text me 5 minutes before my session to cancel). So I confronted her. I told her that I needed a therapist I could rely on. I had been seeing her for a year, she knew me very well, I was comfortable speaking with her, and I really didn't want to start over with someone new. I told her all of this, and I told her I needed to know whether I could rely on her or not. And if not, I needed to find a new therapist. Well, my therapist assumed all responsibility and was very apologetic. She told me I was absolutely right and that she was failing at her duty as my therapist. She promised to make adjustments in her life so that she could be better at her job. She also congratulated me for speaking up and \"lighting a fire under her ass\" about this issue. It ended up working out, and we haven't had any issues since.\n\nSo if you confront your therapist about this, *that* is the kind of response she should have. She should take responsibility, and have *absolutely no excuse whatsoever.* Not even something small like \"oh I was just a little distracted that day\" or anything like that. That is not your concern. You should never, ever have to worry whether your therapist is there for you or not.\n\nSo if you want to continue working with her, it's worth confronting her on this issue. If she doesn't respond appropriately, then ditch her. And if you keep her and she *ever* does this again, then get rid of her.",
            "coincidentally i was the other patient recently with my therapist - i got my times mixed up actually and came an hour early to my appointment. you know what my therapist did? she laughed it off with me about the confusion, pointed out a private area away from potential classmates where i could wait (it's the counseling center for my university), and apologized that i had to wait when it was my fault in the first place! i wasn't allowed to take that time slot when someone else had it just because i came early because that doesn't make any sense.\n\nthis is how it should have been handled - the early patient should have either come back or waited it out in the waiting area for their appointment time and that's what your therapist should have instructed them to do. \n\ni know everyone has already said leave her (and i agree!!!), but i just wanted to add that therapists should know how to deal with this appropriately and professionally because it happens a lot and it says quite a lot about her for not immediately reacting in such a way. you'll find someone much better. i'm sorry you had such an experience.",
            "It was very unprofessional.   The only possible explanation might be that the person coming in was in crisis,  and she felt it was an emergency? \n\nTell her how you feel.  After all, what good is a therapy session if you can't say how you feel.    \"I felt very hurt and angry when you sent me away early.  \"      \nIf you don't think she understood why this was so horribly upsetting,  I feel it's best you get someone new",
            "This makes me soooo mad. Honestly, unless you feel that you benefit from her whatsoever I would not see her again. That is so cold and unprofessional on so many levels. \n\nI would let her know why you will not be seeing her any further either. She needs to know how she minimized your \"issues\" over her other client. I also agree with everyone else in that you should not pay for that session, whatever time she did spend with you.\n",
            "Social Worker here- I may get buried since this is an \"older\" post at this point. I want to say that while I agree that this may not be the best way to handle to situation and she should have handled it differently. There may have been something going on with the other \"patient\" or person that could have potentially violated their or your counselor's confidentiality. The counselor may have said it was an evaluation to stave off any questions about the other person's emergency or it could have been an emergency personal matter that she did not feel comfortable discussing with you. \n\nI think you should definitely address the discomfort you had about the session with them (as that is therapeutic too) and base your feelings on that. I feel that reporting them to the state or insurance may be too harsh in this one time instance as those can have GRAVE consequences. I do understand that the session went poorly and made have had a setback but I think people often forget that we are people too and occasionally can't give our best. \n\ntldr- I don't think you should \"write off\" this therapist without at least discussing your feelings and then possible termination (as it is healthy to practice termination even in relationships that you aren't happy with). It would be ultimately the most healing for you particularly if you're battling PTSD and an abuse history. \n\nBest of luck to you ~",
            "That's definitely fucked up and unprofessional. No restaurant would tell you to get out to make room for new customers. No doctor would dream of making you leave halfway in to a visit. Therapists don't do that either. I would definitely talk to your therapist about how that made you feel and that you felt it was unfair and see how it goes. If she brushes it off, go find a different one, because that really is not right.",
            "Therapist here. I would encourage you to talk to your therapist about this and how it hurt you before you decide to change to another therapist. This could be a healing moment for you to express your needs and what you felt. If you do that and feel unheard and invalidated you have the power to leave that relationship and create another one. I'm not sure what your life story is, but I know that this sounds like your therapist created a potentially unsafe space for you.\n\nIn all honesty this isn't something I would have done, especially when someone was talking about their abuse. It does sound unprofessional and I wonder what her motivation was.",
            "Maybe.\n\nNext time you see her, ask.\n\nIt is possible teh person after you was actuively suicidal or aggressive or something. She couldn't tell you because that would breach confidence, but now, after teh fact, she could say that it was urgent or something.\n\nI agree it is a bad way of handling things but if its been working well so far don't throw it all away.",
            "Generally, most therapists (in my experience) will not do what they did without a reason. That they told you that patient was an evaluation says a lot; that patient was likely what is called an \"at-risk\" patient, and has been requested by an APS screener, law enforcement, or crisis management, to be evaluated for risk. In other words, they are a potential risk to themselves or others.\n\nAs someone with PTSD and a background like yours, I am sorry. Unfortunately, at least in the US, that explanation is all they can legally give you. If this therapist has been helpful thus far, and is someone who has shown you progress, go back. Certainly tell them that the incident was painful and you are hurt, but understand that the patient who needed an eval likely arrived an hour early because they were likely in crisis (if suicidal, about to go through with plan. If mental health, actively homicidal/suicidal/hallucinating).\n\nBest of luck OP!",
            "I'm so sorry that happened to you! That was extremely unprofessional and I can't imagine why your therapist felt that was an acceptable behaviour. To put things into perspective my therapist profusely apologised when she had to answer a call and that lasted less than a minute as she told them to call later because she was in the middle of a session. You should expect to have your therapist's undivided attention! I would understand stopping a session so abruptly only in an extreme situation,  for example if the other patient  was in a fragile mental state,  needing hospitalisation or threatening to harm themself surely not because they're a first timer that arrived an hour earlier. It is your decision at the end of the day but I would think hard if you can trust your therapist anymore after this behaviour. ",
            "Idk if this helps, but something similar happened to my family.\n\nI had an appointment for my son.  I called two days prior, left a not detailed message for her to return my call.  She didn't.\n\nI called the day-of since I didn't hear from her, to confirm the appointment.\n\nShe said, \"I assumed you called to cancel so I booked your time with someone else.  Your son can't come in today.\"\n\nI told her I left her a message to call me back. Not anything whatsoever to do with canceling the appointment.  Just \"hey it's me, call me back\".\n\nShe apologized.  I told her this was the last thing I would expect from a therapist, to assume something with zero evidence to support her assumption.\n\nI never went back.  If she said there had been an emergency, I'd have gone back.  She admitted she totally screwed up, I got to say to her face that it was a pretty bad screw up and said good bye.\n\nSo....give your therapist a chance to explain.  If it is as cruddy as you fear it is, don't go back.",
            "You might notice that a lot of people on this sub are insanely dramatic. There's one person saying she would never get his business again.\n\nBut this isn't a donut shop. Finding a good, helpful therapist is not that easy, so follow other people's advice and bring it up with her. You're definitely within your rights to be upset.",
            "If the patient came 1 hour early then why would she reschdule your scheduled appointment? I am thinking that she messed up with the schedules, not the other patient. She did not want loose the new patient so she rescheduled your appointment. Heh, why I always assume the worst scenario...",
            "First,  I'm proud of you for all your hard work. It isn't easy.   I know this from experience. \n\nSpeaking of,  my therapist - a specialist in sexually abused women and children - would never do this.   Sometimes, the person before me would spill over a bit into my time.   My therapist would ask if I had time for my full session,  or offer to schedule the next day. . Obviously during her lunch/off days.   She would also stay after hours if i talked a bit over too.  \n\nI know it's hard to divulge what happened to other people.   Maybe ask the support group or a crisis center for suggestions for a new counselor?   You deserve better,  in my opinion.   Good luck,  OP.  I wish you well",

            "That is so out of order what she did. I had a similar experience with a therapist who was so uninterested in what I had to say, came it late and would make me leave early. I complained to her manager and asked for a new one. I know it's tough to change therapists! It sucks but maybe after you talk to her you can find another one? \n\nIt is shit that you will technically have to pay for a session where she dismissed you and then the free session which is next will only consist of you talking to her about how being dismissed early upset you. I personally do not think its worth it. She should give you a refund, and you should look into taking your business elsewhere. ",
            "Sometimes one therapist won't be the one to see you all the way through on your journey to recovery. I've seen 4 on my journey, of varying degrees of helpfulness and support.\n\nCan I ask what her qualifications are? I once had a similar situation, and I'm wondering if there's any similarities in the pedigrees of your counselor and my former counselor. ",

            "The only time I could see this being appropriate, would be in case of some emergency.   Maybe the next client was suicidal and the therapist's afraid that there's something wrong and wants to talk to her as soon as possible before she decides to leave.\n\nShe can't tell you this, and may have said something about confusing the times.  Otherwise it does sound really unprofessional.",
            "You better not have had to pay for a full hour because you sure as hell didn't get one.",

            "Before you fire her, make sure you talk to her... Is there any chance that this new patient might have been in immediate self-harm risk and came to the appointment early because of it? How she acted toward you was wrong, but if that other patient was having self-harm ideations, it might have distracted her and made her unintentionally cold towards you. She may not have been able to tell you why because of patient confidentiality laws (and also may not have wanted to alarm you). Self harm/suicidal tendencies (as you might already know) are really time-sensitive and escalate quickly without the right response, and as important as each patient's appointment is, if this person is thinking of hurting himself/herself or others, it's going to put your therapist in a difficult position. She needs to deescalate this other person as quickly as possible, but she is already tied up. If she continues with your appointment as scheduled, this other person may think \"I need her help right now, but she doesn't give a fuck about me\" and act on their thoughts. If she cancels you (like she did), of course you think \"She doesn't give a fuck about me, my appointment isn't important at all\" and now you're rescheduled and unhappy and hurt. That may not have been her intention, but maybe those were her choices. And maybe she did what she thought was best, whether it was entirely right or not. It's just an idea of what I thought was the possible behind-the-scenes scenario.\n\nNormally, I'd say screw her, but something's making me question what she did and why. Maybe because it seems out of character for someone who's been so great with you. But do make sure you get that refund. And if she was really just being a bitch, fuck her anyway. There are plenty of other great therapists out there, I'm sure.",
            "I would be in tears. I would be in absolute tears.\n\nI've had similar feelings when I just couldn't reach a therapist to make an appointment. But something like this would feel like an absolute betrayal. she would have to make it up to me big time to gain some sort of trust back.",
            "Maybe the other patient was in high crisis (suicidal, psychotic, etc.) She may not be able to tell you why it was important to see that person immediately, but you should have a phone call with her and see if she recognizes and apologizes for her actions. Her behavior during that phone call can help you decide if you should retain her.",
            "That is extremely unprofessional. She should have rescheduled the other person or made them stick to their scheduled appointment. Asking you to cut yours short was WAY out of line. I used to have a therapist years ago who was a stickler about this. She would never have done what your therapist did. I once showed up at the wrong time and was worried I'd have to reschedule. She understood, but said I could either stick around an hour for our regular time or she'd have to charge me for not canceling at least a day early. She was nice about it, but she would never interrupt a session because another client showed up at the wrong time.",
            "Hello, I'm a therapist in training seeing clients and hope my perspective can help.\n\nYour therapist did something really shitty and unprofessional, she devalued your time and abandoned you in the middle of an emotional outpouring. Your therapist is also human being, that makes mistakes and has flaws. For whatever reason she made this decision and that cannot be changed. What you decide to do next needs to be based on how she handles things from now on. \n\nPlease go to the rescheduled meeting and talk to her about how the incident made you feel. If she gets defensive, emotionally shuts you off, or plays it down you should rethink your therapist. If she is  willing to hear where you're coming from, emotionally supports and validates you, and apologizes things should be fine.\n\nEveryone makes mistakes but a good therapist must make strides to repair your therapeutic relationship. \n\nI once plain out forgot I had a session with a client because I was on spring break and my whole schedule was atypical. I called and apologized as soon as I remembered (20 mins into the session) we rescheduled and at that session I apologized again. They did not seem to take it personally, but if they had I would have processed it with them. If they felt abandoned I would use it therapeutically because that generally means that they have been abandoned before. So I would need to own up to my actions, apologize, process the clients hurt feelings and then possibly transition into other times in their life that they felt abandoned and gone on with therapy from then on. \n\nFeel free to mention how billing was handled as billing for a full session is not ethical if she cut your session short.\n\nIf you'd like an (almost) therapist to talk to about what is ethical or not, or how to handle the situation further feel free to PM me.",
            "Unprofessional? Yes, but this is also an opportunity to work on emotions related to being brushed off like that as its bound to happen again in other contexts.

            "This is very unprofessional and can definitely set back all the trust she built up over a year. I think it is very important you go to one more appointment to discuss this with her. Let her know how hurt and cast aside you felt after being dismissed while you were in the middle of pouring your heart out. You don't want her to treat anyone else like that and she may not realize how rude and hurtful she was. If you don't feel comfortable even after talking to her about it then I would definitely try to find another therapist and explain to her why.",
            "This is slightly different advice from other posters- maybe you should try one more session, and at least explore those feelings with the therapist. Dynamics between therapist and patient can be useful and I agree she was unprofessional and it was her bad but maybe you can use that as a trampoline to explore how you feel about relationship dynamics in your life and how you want to approach others in general.

Maybe the next patient was someone who needed urgent assessment and because of confidentiality your therapist couldn't tell you why exactly this patient had to be dealt with first?\n\nIf you communicate how this made you feel to your therapist and they are able to address, acknowledge, and validate your concerns, then maybe it's worth giving them the benefit of the doubt?

The only way to know is to express your feelings with your therapist and discuss what happened.  They won't be able to tell you any details about the other patient for confidentiality reasons, but it may give your therapist an opportunity to understand more about how you feel.

(Taken from one of your comments below)\n\n**They aren't saying the other patient was more important than you. No one has said that in ANY of the comments that I've read so far.** But your therapist may have that new patient's case file and just not done her personal eval yet, in which case, she could have known that person was a high-risk suicide/homicide/self-harm case, whereas you (after a year of therapy) may be classified as a lower-risk case, there's a measurable, standardized scale that therapists and clinical psychologists use. \n\n**No one is saying your issues aren't important, but you can't assume that the other individual's issues weren't as or more urgent.** I'm not saying this is the most likely case, after all she did say it was a new patient and it's likely she just didn't want to lose a new client over an old one. \n\nEither way, reddit is the wrong place for this, we're either gonna say fire her or go back to her. What you probably should do instead of asking people here, is talk to her. Let her know how you felt and see what she says. Best case: she apologizes, recognizes her mistake and makes it up to you or indicates that the other case was pressing. Worst case: she just likes the money the new client will bring in. The former would indicate a (debatably poor, unprofessional) judgment call while the latter indicates a shitty therapist.\n\nOnce you have a sense of which scenario it is, you can then keep with her or fire her and find someone new. \n\nEdit: Also in order to know that a client is imminently suicidal (no therapist can predict suicide within the hour or else no one in therapy would actually be able to complete a suicide, it's just based on high/med/low risk criteria), she first needs to do an evaluation.",

            "I had an appointment to see if I had depression. I showed up to my appointment 20 minutes early, registered and sat in the lobby. An hour after my appointment time a nurse finally came to get me ( this was with a general practitioner for diagnosis). I sat in the office for probably another half hour before a nurse came in to take my vitals and have me take that ten question quiz. Again it was about another half hour before I even saw the doctor. \n\nI waited almost 2 hours for a doctor to tell me I was severely depressed. I almost walked out about half a dozen times. During the appointment I explained I was having trouble falling and staying asleep and that it was very hard for me to wake up because of how tired I always feel. She prescribed paxil which might be fine for many people, but I was already sleeping for over ten hours a day as it was. Paxil practically put me in a coma. I was sleeping for 20 hours every single day. It took two weeks to get another appointment, and again, I was left waiting in the lobby for at least 45 minutes, in the office for at least a half hour and so on. She told me to stop taking it and to make an appointment with another doctor who knew more than she did. \n\nI went to that appointment ( after waiting two months to get in, all the while, not taking any pills for depression) and again I end up waiting close to an hour just to see this new doctor. She listens to everything I have to say and eventually settles on welbutrin which is exactly what I heard would be best for my situation for the entire time I was waiting for the appointment.\n\nIts ridiculous that I was treated that way. I see the first doctor all the time and I have often gotten into an appointment the same day I call. Why did I suddenly have to wait for two weeks to see her? Why did I have to wait in the lobby for hours on end, when I've never had to before? I feel like suddenly I was treated like I didn't matter, or I wasn't important enough for her time. Each time while I waited, I was so angry that I had broke down. \n\nLuckily I got the prescription I needed and I'm doing better. I still have to wait quite a while to get an appointment to deal with depression, and I still have to sit in the lobby and office forever. I have no idea why its like this. In my area it takes months and/or years to see a therapist (90%  of them wont even take new patients). I keep going back because it helps.

I mean, you claim that she 'told' you to wrap it up?  My guess is that she *requested* the session be cut short, and you, feeling blindsided, acquiesced.  I strongly doubt that she would give you an ultimatum the way you suggested it went down.  But ignoring that, I feel that you could be slightly less aggrieved given the relationship you have built up with the woman.  This wasn't your first session with her.  And yes, she probably *should* have been more sensitive given your situation- which is what leads me to believe that something is being left out here.",
            "You spent a year being taught that expressing your feelings is healthy, and in this instance you're going to ask the Internet about what to do instead of confronting your therapist yourself? You haven't learned a thing, it seems.",
            "Her actions were extremely unprofessional and you should kick her to the curb. Find someone who actually treats you like you and your feelings matter. \n\nFor those suggesting that you should have a chat with her first, I disagree. She didn't have the time of day to sit through your scheduled session and listen, so why should you schedule more time with her? You're better off using that time to find someone new. ",
            "Here's just a guess... Sure what she did was unprofessional, but take yourself out of the center for just 1 second. Perhaps.... That next person was suicidal, and if your therapist didn't take them that second, they would've driven off a bridge. I know it's hard to think about, but maybe that person who came an hour early was in a really dark place. Obviously talk with your therapist next time, but this was my initial thought. ",
            "Yes, you are justified in being upset. But I wouldn't burn Rome just yet. I would write your feelings down and discuss this with her at your next appointment. She may have had a VERY good reason to prioritize the other patient (suicide, harming other, emergency) None of these she would be able to share with you. \n\nWhile she behaved poorly, you mentioned how helpful she has been. Everyone makes mistakes. Use this as an opportunity to open up to her about how hurt you were. It may help her understand other situations as well. ",
            "That is fucked!  Assuming that is the full context, that is bizarre.  If the other person showed up early, they have to wait.  Period.\n\nNow, I could see a therapist reschedule because she had a patient with an emergency, but that is different.\n\nBizarre.",
            "I am shocked at her behavior and it shows that she has really fucked up boundaries herself. That doesn't mean she can't teach you boundaries- lots of people teach much better than they do- but it was such a terrible judgment call that I am really shocked by it. \n\nAnd I wouldn't feel safe confiding in her. Just when you start to open up you're going to think- omg, what if she gets a text message  she MUST answer right then? \n\nIf New Person needed to be seen THAT quickly, she should have referred her someplace else. (Like, called a colleague or even called 911.)",
            "She was unprofessional, and I bet she isn't there to help you but only take your money.\nDon't go there again. Demand a refund. If she doesn't understand why or won't see your viewpoint then that will say exactly the type of person your therapist is.",
            "It was probably a booty call.",
            "Don't EVER go back!",
            "Wth that is an amateur way to handle that situation. Whether you stay with get or not i believe that you should at least tell her that what she did really got to you and that she should respect her clients appointment time. Geez what a dick",
            "Yes, you do. Also, you should get your money back if you had to pay any...",
            "Yeah that's bullshit.\n\nYou need to write to her and tell her how it inconvenienced you (the walk, etc) why it wasn't appropriate (you were scheduled. They showed up early. They should have had to wait!!!!)\n\nThen tell her that because of her ghastly behavior you will no longer be meeting with her.",
            "The only reason this would have been acceptable is if the other patient was suicidal or had an urgent case, but you say that she was new. You're totally right that it was wrong of her and you should not feel guilty for finding a different therapist.",
            "You are  right! This was not OK. An experienced trauma therapist would never have done something like this. It can trigger up old feelings of abandonment, distrust, hurt, and feeling like your experiences are invalid. I definitely urge you to talk, write, w/e ... But advocate for yourself and communicate your feelings to her! Then, time to find a real trauma specialist.",
            "Very unprofessional. I can see why you'd want to change. Usually I can see things from both sides but not this. ",
            "You said that you have had several sessions with her,  so she knows you and your situation better than any of us.   Maybe she felt that you were emotionally strong enough to handle having your session cut short,  especially since none of us know why this other person was being evaluated.   We don't know their emotional issues and for all we know that person showed up early because they were on the verge of a complete and total breakdown.   A therapist is supposed to be someone you trust and can talk to,  so do that.   Talk to her and tell her what she did hurt you and how you feel.  At the very least she would be able to recommend another therapist that you can speak to. "

        "selftext": "I'll try to make this brief.  My husband, Jonah, passed away unexpectedly a month ago from a stroke.  I don't want to get specific about that part, it's the worst pain I've ever felt in my entire life, and I'm still not sure how I'm ever going to move on.\n\nWe were married for 5 years, together for 7.  The past 2 years we've been trying for a baby, but were just getting to the point of considering IVF when he died.\n\nJonah had a close friend in high school named Marjorie.  Marjorie also ended up going to the same university as he did, and they spent a lot of time together during those college years.  Jonah said that he liked Marjorie's company, but never felt anything beyond friendship with her -- which I totally believe.  \n\nJonah dated other women during that period, but told me that several times Marjorie hinted that she wanted him to ask her out.  She also \"joked\" about wanting him to be her \"plan B\" in case she didn't meet someone and get married by 30.  \n\nBy the time I'd started dating Jonah, he had moved a couple hours away from his hometown (and Marjorie).  Despite this, Marjorie immediately began finding excuses to come to our town and \"hang out\" -- which usually involved her encouraging us to go drinking, and then her passing out on the couch at Jonah's apartment.  I didn't mind her for the most part, but she had a habit of saying things like, \"you know you ruined our marriage pact, haha!\" and pointing out all the things that she knew about him (like what he took in his coffee, his favorite bands, etc).\n\nOver the course of our relationship, and especially after we got married, Jonah definitely put some distance into his relationship with Marjorie.  He confided in me that he felt he had \"outgrown her\" and that they really had little in common anymore.  He stopped responding to her invitations to hang out as often, though he would occasionally call to catch up out of guilt (especially when she would text him or leave messages saying she was \"so sad he was ignoring her\" and the like).\n\nBut now he's gone.  I had him cremated, like he wanted.  We haven't done the memorial service yet -- it was too hard for me to even imagine the first couple of weeks, and I also wanted to give time for some out-of-state people to make travel plans.  The memorial is this weekend.\n\nHowever, two weeks ago, I received an email from Marjorie -- sent to around sixty people, including Jonah's family -- saying that she was holding a memorial service for Jonah in the town where they grew up (the day before his memorial here).  I was completely blown away, seeing as she hadn't mentioned anything to me or even attempted to call.  Along with the details, the email said that she was \"planning the memorial in light of the fact that no other service had yet been held in his memory, and he deserved to be laid to rest with honor\".  For the record, she was invited to the memorial which I've been planning, and knew it was happening.\n\nI called her, of course, and told her that while I appreciated her willingness to help with Jonah's goodbye, I was already planning a service for him that would involve all of his family and friends.  She immediately went on the defensive, and said that she had \"only started to plan a service when she realized I wasn't willing to do it in a timely manner\".  I told her that the timing wasn't her choice to make, but that if she wanted to have a memorial of some kind, to please just add on the invitation that his \"official\" memorial was going to be held this weekend.  She said fine.\n\nI sent a message to all of Jonah's invited friends/family to make sure that they knew the real service with both of our families was going to be here, and then just washed my hands of the whole thing.  \n\nThis week I received a message on facebook from Jonah's cousin, saying that Marjorie (who has apparently blocked me on facebook) created an \"event\" for Jonah's \"official\" memorial service (her memorial) and invited everyone she possibly could.  I've been getting blown up with emails asking which day the memorial is, and where.  I'm honestly furious -- I don't have the emotional energy to deal with this.  \n\nI ended up putting a post up on my wall, reiterating the date of his service here, and asking people to please share it.  Thankfully I think the older members of the family don't use facebook or email very often, so most of them haven't been confused, but a lot of people now think that Marjorie's service is the real one.\n\nI called Marjorie again, asking her to add an addendum to her event saying that his actual memorial was going to be here.  She told me that \"Jonah would have wanted it this way\" and that \"if I couldn't appreciate her efforts, I wasn't invited to say goodbye to Jonah.\"  I told her that was fine, seeing as I'd already said goodbye to Jonah when I held him as he died.  She hung up.\n\nApparently she's now spreading information to her mutual friends with Jonah, saying that he was planning on leaving me because I wasn't able to conceive.  She also said that we had approached her to carry a baby for us -- all absolute lies.  His cousin sent me a screenshot of a text where she said that \"Jonah always thought we would have the cutest baby together\" and that \"AngryWidow doesn't understand how much he wants children\".\n\nI'm at a loss as to what to do.  I don't care what she says about me, but she's now tarnishing my husband's memory -- especially saying that he wanted to divorce.  Jonah would never have left me, and anyone that knows him at all knows that we were committed to each other above all else.\n\nI need to figure out how to tell this woman to fuck off without encouraging her to spread more lies.  And I also want to just forget the whole thing and crawl in bed and never get up again.\n\nHelp me, please.\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: My husband's former \"best friend\" is trying to plan his entire memorial service and is tarnishing his memory.  How do I get her to stop?",

            "Can you deputize another friend or family member to take over Morjorie-handling for you?  Someone to text and facebook everyone, set the record straight when she sends out some message, show up to her memorial and talk to people, etc?  Basically, someone to shield you from her?\n\nThe best way to deal with a Marjorie is to tell people close to you the truth, and let them disseminate it.  The people that matter won't believe her.\n\nIf nothing else, I think that people will realize that her memorial isn't real when you're not there.  That sort of detail sticks out.",

            "I'm so sorry for your loss. I can't imagine the pain you must be in right now.\n\nMarjorie sounds completely fucking insane and malicious. If I were in your shoes I'd be very tempted to go scorched earth on her ass, but that wouldn't be the most constructive approach here. So here's what I'd do instead:\n\n- Send an email to all of the guests you've invited to attend the actual memorial service stating, \"Just to reiterate, the service will be held at [location] on [date].\" Do not mention Marjorie, her lies, or the second service.\n- Contact the funeral home per /u/ThomasBeckett's suggestion and see what can be done to pull the plug on Marjorie's service.\n- Delete and block this woman on all forms of social media, email, your phone, everywhere.\n- UNLESS AND UNTIL somebody comes to you asking about Marjorie's lies, resist the urge to set the record straight. If you try to publicly address her claims on Facebook or elsewhere, it will almost certainly get back to her and she'll be even more fueled by the attention and the knowledge that she's getting under your skin. Cut off her supply by ignoring her.\n- If she crosses the line into character assassination against you, contact legal aid.\n- Content yourself with the knowledge that if any of Jonah's and Marjorie's mutual friends have half a brain, they'll understand she's out of her fucking mind or at least being outrageously inappropriate.\n\nEDIT: Almost forgot!\n\n- Do you have a picture of Marjorie? Get one, and deputize someone at the real memorial service to guard the door and refuse her entry should she show up.",
            "First off, sorry for your loss. You seriously need to tell this girl to go fuck herself. Say in no uncertain terms that YOU are his wife, YOU are his family and her actions are *disgusting*. Call all your family and friends and let them know that YOU, his *WIDOW* will be conducting this memorial service. She is out of her mind if she thinks that anyone will believe her story about him leaving you. *HE HAD A ZILLION OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE THAT GIRL AND TURNED DOWN ALL OF THEM AND MARRIED YOU*. She sounds mentally unstable, seriously so. I would hire an attorney and threaten to sue her for libel. If someone did this to me, I can't even tell you what I would do.

            "I'm so sorry for your loss. This is truly tragic.  I would think that most people would understand that the memorial is where the wife says it is and where the remains will be buried.  Contact the hometown newspaper and do an obituary with the correct information.  Don't fool with this meddling woman again. If half the people show up, so what?  The memorial is for you and his family; to help you let go.  Again, I'm sorry for what you are going thru.",
            "I am sorry for your loss also. I went through a unexpected loss of my wife Feb. 2014 and it is something that just puts you in a unexpected state of mind. You have to stay strong and keep in mind that she is not the one with this responsibility and also share this with his family and have them handle this insensitive bitch. You have your plate full as I know and this distraction isn't wanted or needed at this time. If you can have family members assist you in keeping her in line, I would lean on them to put her in her place. For me a year has passed by, I have a amazing lady in my life that is supporting and loving who has shown me the true happiness that I was longing for. It does get better, life does go on and the sun rises everyday. Keep your head on straight, make to do lists, plan on your future and where you need to be in the year ahead. Best of luck and I hope you know that there is someone out there when you are ready to share the love in your heart with. Keep your head up and keep putting one foot in front of the other. :)",
            "First, i am so terribly sorry for your loss. I do not have the right words to express how sorry I am.\n\nSecond, I became enraged reading this. IDK if you have anyone who can help you stand up to this woman, but if you're in FL and need some help this weekend, it's my weekend off and I'd be more than happy to stand \"guard\" at your memorial service to make sure this whacko cannot enter. Or even if you need someone to handle other things in regards to her. I have a very mean nurse bitch face I can put on at a moments notice. I can handle crazy. PM me if I can assist you. I know I'm an internet stranger, but I am so angry and upset for you. You don't need this on top of everything else.\n\nIf this escalates, you need to seek legal guidance. Try not to respond to ANY of the crazy she's spewing. Let her make herself look crazy. She doesn't need much help. I promise you that. You keep your head held high. Redirect anyone asking for which memorial to go to, to your own. And if you need help with that, please don't hesitate to ask. \n\nYou are a strong, brave women. You can do this. Do not let her effect you. She's nuts. You are his wife, everyone knows that. The more crazy she talks, the more crazy she looks. (((Hugs))) to you. ",
            "I feel like we're stepping dangerously close to law enforcement territory here. I wonder what a lawyer would say to this.",
            "I am not a lawyer but you should contact a lawyer. As the executor of your husband's estate (unless he left someone else in charge as the executor) you are well within your realms to file cease and desists saying that people cannot use his name in ways that you do not approve of. Your husband wasn't famous, but for example, Terry Pratchett's widow could tell websites or book publishers that his name is not allowed to be used unless it is cleared with the executor of his estate. \n\nYou are the one who has to protect your husband's name now. If she wants to hold a memorial she can do so but she's not allowed to call it his official memorial service without your say so. This is similar to if she printed something slanderous or libelous about him in the newspaper, you as the executor of his estate would be within your right to send her a cease and desist and sue for any damages.\n\nHave the cousin save a screen shot of her memorial event on Facebook. Save the physical invitation from the memorial service she was planning. Give these to the lawyer. Pay your lawyer out of the estate your husband left you (if he had any life insurance policies, investments, assets that you are selling because you no longer need a second car or need the house you lived in because you don't want to and you don't need that much space anymore). Then tell the lawyer to pursue a civil suit for the damages caused monetarily by her actions, namely the money you're spending on the lawyer to get her to stop.\n\nMost likely you will have to take her to small claims and a mediator but you can get her to stop and get your lawyer fees paid for and maybe even a little more for the emotional distress of having to do this. \n\nDon't confront her. Just call a lawyer first thing Monday morning. You might want to call an estate lawyer.",
            "I have no opinions or advice. I just wanted to say how truly sorry I am, both for your loss, and because this wretched and jealous person is making things worse for you.\n\nSome people like to make it all about them. My mother's mom and youngest sister made my father's life absolute hell when my mom died. They didn't even end up saying their goodbyes when she passed, or coming to her wake. (I don't refer to them as \"Grandma\" and \"aunt\" because of this. They just aren't family to me after that.) They threw temper tantrums like spoiled children and demanded that everyone stop attending to my mother and pay attention to them. My mom was an agnostic, and they demanded a southern baptist funeral. It made everything so much worse for my dad and my mom's oldest sister, who were already hurting so deeply. \n\nIt completely blows my mind when people pull this kind of callous, disrespectful nonsense around grieving widows and widowers. It's basically the absolute worst in human behavior, and this woman is just horrid.\n\nYou seem like you have the patience of a saint.

Send the email reiterating the time and the place of the memorial and cut Marjorie out of your life. \n\nAs for the \"other\" service. The people who show up are going because they loved and admired your husband. They are there for him-not Marjorie. She and her self a absorbed bullshit will be found out eventually. Just focus on what you and your family need right now and let Marjorie be the crazy bitch that she is. She can't hide it and you certainly don't have to acknowledge it.\n\nYou were Jonah's wife. Nobody can take that from you and anybody who knew him knows how much he cared for you. I wish you the best in your healing process.",
            "(((Hugs)))\n\nI am so sorry for your loss!\n\nThere is a lot of good advice here.  Have your lawyer contact the funeral home/church/whatever where Marjorie's service is being held and notify them that this is causing great pain to the deceased's widow and conflicts with his memorial.   \n\nHave your lawyer get a restraining order against her.  THis is nutcase levels of harrassment.   \n\nGather your loved ones around you.  Get support from your friends and loved ones and qualified grief counselors.  \n\nYou were loved deeply and wonderfully.  I feel so sorry for your loss.  You are honoring his memory by handling this with style and grace.\n\n(((hugs)))",

            "Looks like your husband had a really good reason for not getting involved with her. Its because she's batshit crazy.\n\nWhat sort of narcissist would try to hijack her dead would-be-boyfriend's funeral away from a grieving widow? What the hell is she thinking?\n\nFinding a delegate to handle this for you would be handy because there is likely to be some very strong words and firm language used. ",
            "Hi OP.  I am so, so sorry for your loss.  I, too, lost my spouse suddenly and unexpectedly and it was really, really hard on me.  I also went through something similar to you.  My wife was hit by a drunk driver while I was out of town and her mother and sisters were convinced that my wife was also drunk at the time of the accident (despite official toxicology reports saying the opposite).  I guess it helped them reconcile the situation (I really don't know, it's still completely fucked), but they actually spread this lie around to our mutual friends/acquaintances to the point that some people believed it.  It was and is still really hard on me and I will never forgive them for that.  I felt like my sweet, beautiful wife's memory was being smeared when there was nothing I could do.\n\nI know that this isn't any sort of advice for you, but I just wanted to know that I completely sympathize with you.  While I really don't know how you should (or I would) handle your situation, I just wanted to tell you this truth that I learned.  The people who truly matter to you and who truly mattered to your husband will remember him for who he truly was, not for who this woman is trying to make him out to be.",

            "You can probably get FB to take down her \"event.\"  Of course you would need the help of someone who can see it.  \n\nI'm very sorry for your loss.  And I understand that you have already set up your memorial, but I hope you aren't feeling badly about not having done it earlier (as Marjorie implied you should have).  YOU are his person, and this should all be happening on your timeline, not anyone else's.  ",
            "OK this is probably going to be long, and I apologize for that. in April of 2008 my father died of a heart attack. He was 54 years old.\n\nMy mother had him cremated as well, as that was his wish. What my mom had was lots of support(sadly not from me, I was a wreck), mostly her best friend dealt with everything. Whether it was  the funeral director, or letting everyone know of his passing.\n\nSo first things first, at the end we had two actual memorials. We had the \"major\" one, the one that included his family(he was one of 12 children), my moms family, his kids, and our good friends. Now the thing with this was, we had it in a city that was almost 2 hours from where we lived. We did this for a couple reasons, firstly it was where he and my mother grew up, and second was that we got the event location for free. \n\nWhat this did do was alienate some of the people that knew my dad in our neighborhood, which was actually a fair amount of people, its kinda isolated and small(my elementary had 90 kids) and my dad pretty well knew everyone. He was the type of person that would stop you on the road and have a chat, its kinda hard to explain, but its the kinda place where you'd end up blocking the road because you were chatting with the guy in oncoming traffic. But what the people of our community did was through their own, they invited everyone from the community and kinda left it open, most of the family didn't go, but the people that he knew in the community could come and pay their respects/condolences. It turned out great.\n\nNow when it comes to the death off someone, it truly brings out a persons true colors. There were numerous people that our family ended up cutting out of our life because of my dads passing, these were people we thought of as our friends.\n\nJust to name a few, one neighbor told us that my Dad wanted him to have my dads business, and that he would run it for us... rampant theft from our property(literally most things that weren't nailed down)....one neighbour decided to like try to get in my moms face by driving back and forth down our dead end street, had to get the police involved with that one... one of my Dads friends handed us a \"bill\" for work the day of the memorial totaling $8,000.\n\nLong story short, people end up being shitty once someone dies. It will end up better though, because you can cut them out of your life.\n\nTL:DR Have two memorials who cares, it just shows how many people loved your husband, and people can be shitty when someone dies, fuck 'em.",
            "I agree with the handler suggestions completely. My aunt lost her husband almost 2 years ago and before the memorial happened one of his close friends was asking for a very \"sentimental\" guitar of her husband, he owned about 20 this one ales happened to be worth around 12 thousand dollars. After she said no because his death was not sudden and he had time to give gifts to those he wanted to and he did not leave him anything. She even offered to let him pick any other guitar out but he insisted on the special one. He would call, text, message , call her family everyday while she tried to hold herself together and put on a good face for everyone else. It only took a couple days but her husbands best friend handled the other friend and told him he wasn't getting anything and was able to control him and shield her from his harassment. This friend also had multiple chances to say goodbye to the husband and did not show up once and did not bother to make it to the memorial which she personally invited him.  ",

You know, the one held by his *real* wife. I couldn't imagine anyone who really knew/loved him taking her word over yours, and if they do, fuck 'em. True colors shown. ",

The thing you need to do now is take away her credibility so no one *believes* those lies. Personally, I'd post everything she's ever done in a big post and put it all out there to see. Then I'd send her a message telling her to knock it off or hear from a lawyer. Then I'd hire the biggest bouncer to keep her out.

Only a cruel nut would spread hurtful stories about a grieving widow **even if the hurtful things were true**. \n \nTry to focus on the good things: You **know** that you are Jonah's true love and that Marjorie's perception that he was going to leave you for her is nothing more than a desperate, insane delusion. You know that Jonah would not approve of her acting like such an asshat, and I bet there is a good chance that most of his family and friends see her terrible behavior for what it is. \n\nI agree with the suggestion to ask for someone who is not as close to the tragedy to handle correcting the misinformation and giving Marjorie the verbal smackdown she deserves. If she won't back down, then I think it would be totally justified to talk to a lawyer.",

Usually I don't like to air out dirty laundry, but she's actively spreading rumors about you, your deceased husband, and your relationship. You're perfectly in the right for setting it straight. I understand that it's painful and annoying for you to talk to others right now, especially about such a personal issue at such a terrible time, but better nip those rumors in the bud asap, before they get too out-of-hand.\n\nAs for the memorial situation, I second the suggestion to get those who are closer to you / know the situation to act as ambassadors for you to get the word out that the memorial you're hosting is indeed the official one. It also wouldn't hurt to inform them of the full situation with Marjorie (her lies) and allow them to help you set the word straight with the less informed people.

Clearly it is escalating and it will continue to do so, especially if she doesn't get what she wants (attention and acknowledgement from others that somehow her place in Jonah's life was greater than yours).  I wouldn't be surprised if she goes batshit crazy if the \"turn out\" at her memorial isn't what she expects.  Protect yourself in every way you can...  share with those you trust the communications and proof you have about her behavior.  And then give her the rope and let her hang herself with it.  Crazy can pretend to be normal for only so long.\n\nThe more I think about this the more it concerns me...  what is she capable of later, after the memorial?

They don't cost much and most lawyers would be happy to help. Other options to consider are filing for a restraining order or perhaps following through on the threat of legal action if she continues, as I'm not really sure what she'd do considering her mental state is questionable at best.\n\nI'm sorry you had to go through this all when you should just be allowed to grieve.

My grandma was helping with my business and had some of my vehicles in her name because of it, my aunt tried to take those and they are still in limbo a couple years later, aunt lives all the way across country and they sit in my yard cause i cant get them legal without her signature, she cant pick them up cause it would cost her to much to come get them, so they just sit here.\n\nIts been a huge mess, theres a bunch more to it, but none of it worth talking about as ive put it all behind me and am still moving forward.\n\nId honestly say you should in this order even:\n1. Contact a lawyer and see what your options are.\n2. Contact Jonahs parents or other close relative and see if you can get some help with this.\n3. Block her in every single way, no invite to the funeral or anything, no facebook, no phone calls.\n4. Make sure someone keeps her away from the funeral as well cause she may try and cause some shit during what should be a time of remembering Jonah.\n5. Get on with your life afterwards and dont look back at this time. Like i said some people during deaths can be crazy motherfuckers and do wild out of the norm bullshit. My aunt and I half ass get along now but theres still tension and likely we will never be close due to this, due to her being family though shes still a part of my life no matter how minor. When i think about all the shit that went down it pisses me off to no end but its done and gone for the most part and no sense working myself up over it.\n\nYour still fairly young, im just barely older than you, you have a whole life ahead of you and best you can do is to live it in honor of Jonah who likely would want you to keep on. This chic is out of line, but really being a crazy asshole seems to be some peoples grieving process. She may look back one day and realize it, or she may not. Ive lost several people close to me and dealt with this shit every single time. Its always hard and always is a different person doing it. Others around you both will probably come to their own conclusions on this, its best to take the high road and ignore her and the shit shes trying to stir up but not so much as to not do anything about it if it can be helped.\n\nIts crap like this that i fear. Im 30, two years ago i died of a heart attack, wife and first responder brought me back. But during this time a bunch of crap went down between my wife and family cause no one thought id make a full recovery and some didnt even think id make it at all. No one deserves this bullshit to happen to them at one of the worst times of their life. If you ever need someone to vent to who has plenty of experience with this im here. Plus side to venting to me is it wont get back to anyone in your life and cause more shit and i wont judge you for it, its sometimes nice to talk to someone not involved like that to just get the anger out which im assuming you likely have, i know i have at times.\n\nGood luck to you though, hope it all works out in your favor, like others have said id keep on going through with your funeral thing and make sure people know its the official one without dragging her into it in anyway.",
            "Time to lawyer up, hand it over to them, and let them send her a cease and desist letter and handle any legal action needed if she proceeds. The woman's nuts, and you should be grieving now, not dealing with her. Thomas_Becket's advice is good, I fully agree it's time to let a lawyer dial this nut down. ",
            "I can barely read the comments on this thread, what Marjorie did is beyond the pale! I wanna fly out and beat that woman!!",
            "...What the fuck. :/",
            "I am very sorry for your loss. \n\nI would lawyer up as /u/ngadave suggests. Also, prepare a short note stating that you are not involved with Marjorie's service, that you were not invited (or deliberately told not to attend), and that you do not have any further information on it. Then include the time and place of the service you are holding. Then when people email you copy and paste this into a return email. You don't have to get into details or any drama at this point. Let the lawyer handle the drama for you. ",
            "Aside from having yours first, I would try to enlist the help of Jonah's parents, brothers, and sisters.  Maybe one of them could talk to her.  What she is doing to you is highly inappropriate and I hope you can find the strength to survive through this BS during a hard time in your life.  ",
            "Well, if there's one thing you can feel good about, it's that if it weren't for you, your husband could've ended up with this horrid woman.",
            "This is a great comment. Do this! Where do you wise people come from? OP, please ease some of your burden and give this sandwish of poop (swedish expression translated) to someone you trust. This i a favor I would GLADLY do for a friend. Best of luck and love to you.",
            "My sincerest condolences. I remember having to organise my mother's memorial service and it broke my heart. We had a terrible time with the venue and just calling them repetitively was more than I could handle. I can only imagine how terrible this is. I think the advice for a proxy and a lawyer to handle the matter is excellent and I don't really have anything to add. I just wanted to express my admiration for the strength and grace you have shown in handling this so far. I would have long been reduced to a sobbing mess shouting obscenities down the phone. You are handling this brilliantly, but it is time to hand it own so you can focus on sending your husband off in peace and then get on with the slow process of healing. ",
            "I'm so so sorry. It takes a certain kind of person to behave like she is.",
            "I'm so, so sorry for the loss of your husband. My heart breaks for you. \n\nTake the high road and keep on with your life and plans, people will know that you are priority and the one that needs consolation. ",
            "All the advice on her is solid and I don't have anything to add but I would like to say I'm sorry for your loss, and that I actually cannot believe what some people are capable of. It is actually sickening. \n\nCondolences to your families and friends. ",
            "I am so sorry for your loss.  I can't even imagine having to deal with Marjorie on top of your grief.\n\nI agree with all the great advice you've gotten and I too would contact a lawyer to send a cease and desist letter to Marjorie.  It won't come in time for the memorial, but it should tell her to stop telling people he was about to divorce you.\n\nAgain, condolences.  ",
            "I'm so angry for you!! What a lowlife bitch. She just wants the attention. As long as his family knows and is involved with your official memorial I don't think there's a lot you can do about her. I hope you're on good terms with his family. Just make your own memorial special for you and the main people involved. Let her have her little party. You don't need to hear about it or think about it at all. Keep dignified. \n\nI'm so so sorry for your loss and do feel free to pm if you ever need to talk or rant. ",
            "That woman is crazy. My advice might be unpopular but I think you should just let her have her way. You already told everyone where you'll hold the memorial. Some people will go to her's but the important ones will go to yours anyway I think. It really doesn't tarnish your husband's memory if you don't let it get to you. The people who matter will see her for what she is anyway. She's dangerous, don't give her an excuse to hurt you more than she already did. Be careful!",
            "What are the odds you are going to ever see her again being that there are mutual friends?",
            "Does it help to know you have a lot of support in your position, that you're not the mentally ill one in this situation?",
            "Holy balls.  This lady is nuts.",
            "I would contact those you know were close to him and tell them that she's being a nut pretty much. How disrespectful of her. She should be working WITH you not making a second memorial because yours isn't good enough. She really does sound like a psycho making up the baby rumor. WTF?",
            "I'm so sorry this is happening to you OP. What she's doing is not alright. Follow the advice of /u/Thomas_Becket, /u/C1awed, /u/6151richmondst and others who've come with great suggestions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope everything will go as smoothly as it possible can OP. ",
            "This really angered me to read. What a bitch. Sorry, OP. I hope it works out. I agree with everyone else, you should get somebody else involved because the people that matter will know the truth. You are his wife for Gods sake, so of course it's going to smell funny when you're not at the \"actual\" memorial held by her. ",
            "Damn bitch get out the way",
            "Publicly announce that this person is trying to make a competing memorial, it is not the 'official' one, won't have his remains,  that she is trying to take people away from the real one to attend her's, and this is causing you great emotional distress. ",
            "I must say I've never heard of a weird case like this.  When you're trying to provide a dignified memorial, this yapping little runt dog of a woman (regardless of her physical size) is turning it into a circus.\n\nI think the best  you can do is to act dignified yourself.  You don't have to invite her to your memorial if you don't want, after all she's the one diminishing it.  And if someone mentions her to you, just say that she seems very jealous and you are disappointed she is acting like this.  Cut her no break, but don't be drawn into it.  Be superior.  You were and are his wife.  \n\nShe is the one who wanted him so much she couldn't even let go after he married  you, practically a stalker.  You should barely deign to notice her.\n\nI am sorry for your loss.",
            "Please update!! I'm wishing all the best for you. ",
            "What a fucking nightmare, I am so sorry. Crazy will live on, and if you understand her madness others see it too. Don't worry about a bat shit insane woman's gossip, but there is plenty of good advice here if it progresses to cause harm.\n\nI hope things get easier for you.",
            "[deleted]",
            "I am soooo sorry you are dealing with this!\nI couldn't even begin to imagine.",
            "Where did OP go?",
            "HOLY SHIT, THIS FUCKING BITCH. This is probably the most frustrating, angering story I've ever read on here. If I was one of your bff's, I would seriously consider beating this bitch's ass and I haven't fought n years since I\"m an adult and stuff. \n\nYour husband's family should get in touch with this psycho cunt and tell her the fucking deal.",
            "I am worried for your safety. You sure she didn't kill him out of jealousy.",
            "Some people need an ass whooping.",

            "Feel free to link this thread around. It's a throwaway. I don't see what other agenda you'd possibly have to stage your post.",
            "this sounds like Marjorie's putting on a mask or something. I would probably visit her one evening as she walks to her car. just let her know what you think of her \"efforts\"."
