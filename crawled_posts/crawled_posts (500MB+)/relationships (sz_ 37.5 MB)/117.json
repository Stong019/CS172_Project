        "selftext": "So, I\u2019m not sure if this is cause for concern or I\u2019m paranoid so maybe all of you can figure this out for me\u2026\n \n \nBackstory:\n \nMy fianc\u00e9, James, and I have been together for 3 years- planning a wedding for October 2016. A few months before we met, James brought a brand new home in a newer subdivision. We recently refinanced it and added my name.\n \nBefore me, James dated a woman, Britt, for about 7 months (she\u2019s never been to this current house). From what he\u2019s told me, they broke up when he decided they weren\u2019t as compatible. The breakup was rough- to the point where he and neighbors called the police when she wouldn\u2019t leave his front yard and was screaming at 10 pm at night. This is all from what he and his sister have told me. I don\u2019t have a reason to not believe them. I\u2019ve only had a few run-ins with Britt. These have been at restaurants or just coincidences out in public. We never spoke up until now.\n \nThe problem:\n \nBritt has bought a house in the same subdivision that we live in. We even share a cul-de-sac. The only reason we found out about this is from a flyer we got welcoming her to the neighborhood (our subdivision is very \u201ccommunity\u201d oriented). James insists he\u2019s never told her where he lives and hasn\u2019t spoken to her since the night he called the police.  We both brushed it off as a coincidence but lately it\u2019s becoming very weird.\n \nHere\u2019s why:\n \n-I work for a company that allows me to work from home 3 out of the 5 days. Our home is a ranch and my office window faces the street. I\u2019m not sure what Britt does for a living but she does not work during the day. From about noon until 3, she spends her time walking up and down our street. When she passes our house, she doesn\u2019t take her eyes off of it. It\u2019s almost like she can see me in the office. She\u2019ll even stop in front of our house and stretch there for about 5 minutes. Every day anyone is at home. It makes me uncomfortable to the point where I have all of our blinds closed during the day. I understand the need for exercise but she walks for 3 hours just going up and down our street.\n \n-Another issue is when either James or I are outside with the dog, she\u2019ll let her dog outside and it will come sprinting to our yard. This causes her to come and get her dog. Every time she says \u201cI\u2019m sorry, were still working on training.\u201d James and I are always polite. Normally, I would be ok with this but James has pointed out that any other time she lets her dog out and we\u2019re not outside, she\u2019ll immediately correct him before he runs off. She never corrects him when we\u2019re outside.\n \n-We\u2019ve been getting \u201cding dong ditched\u201d a lot since she\u2019s moved in. Something that\u2019s NEVER happened in the 4 years that James owned the house. The doorbell will ring around dinner time (between 6 and 8) and by the time anyone gets to the door, no one will be there. It\u2019s gotten to the point where our Doberman has picked up the routine and waits by the front door, pacing.  \n \n-The last issue, which I believe might be illegal, is that our mail seems to go missing for a while and then pop back up. What I mean is, Britt will knock on our door and say that she received our mail and is just returning it. This has NEVER happened with the previous owners in her house. We don\u2019t have a new mail carrier either. It seems to happen once a week and she\u2019ll always bring it on a Friday night. Based on the date on the envelopes, we can tell she\u2019s been holding it all week. This has pushed James over the edge because she had our water bill which resulted in us being 2 days late on the payment (James is neurotic when it comes to paying bills). Every time I have to convince him not to go over and yell at her because we haven\u2019t actually caught her taking it out of our mailbox as much as I try to monitor it. She usually gets two days-worth of mail because those are the days I\u2019m not working from home, the other days I get it right away.\n \nI\u2019m not sure what to do at this point.  I don\u2019t want to piss her off by confronting her but how can I get her to stop? She\u2019s making us nervous and I feel uncomfortable in my own yard most of the time because I know she is watching.\n \nAny advice? I know this sounds strange but I\u2019m not sure if I can legally do anything about it. I don\u2019t have anything against her; it\u2019s just becoming an annoyance.\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: My fianc\u00e9s ex girlfriend recently moved in across the street. Weird things have been happening- being ding dog ditched, having our mail taken, etc. We're not sure what to do or how to approach the situation. ",

            "SECURITY CAMERAS catch her stealing your mail. That's a federal offense- and based on their past very likely enough for him to get a restraining order and get her kicked out of her house. Do it. ",
            "Document everything; times, locations, actions. \n\nFor the letters, get some sort of secure mailbox that can't be opened without a key. \n\nAnd for the love of god keep an eye on your dog when you take it for a walk, especially if it tried to eat something off the ground. Who knows what sort of crazy is going on inside her head. ",
            "I would not confront her directly or say anything to her. If I were going to confront her I would do so with the police, and evidence. About the mail, I WOULD CALL THE POST OFFICE, and ask to speak with the mailman of your area, or ask if it's possible that all of the sudden he/she is delivering it to the wrong place. You could also just say, \"we believe a neighbor is taking our mail, but are unsure,\" can you pay extra close attention to the mail you deliver to our house and her's and make sure there is no mistake, so we can find out if this is true or not?\" \n\nYou should also hang out right inside your doorway one night and wait for the doorbell to ring. I think it would be worth it to see the look and panic on her face (if it's her).\n\nIn all seriousness though, I would call the police and tell them everything you've said here. I would make it clear that you aren't positive, but ever since she has moved in weird things have been happening, and she has been acting strangely. At the very least, this would allow them to have some sort of idea already what is going on, and what you suspect, just in case anything further happens. Definitely try to get camera installed...I'm sure whoever installs them would understand and try to be discreet/make it look like he/she is fixing something else.\n\nI guess I would confront her about the dog, and tell her she needs to keep her mangy mutt off of your property or you are going to call the authorities (i'm assuming you have leash laws).",
            "**Security cameras**, a locking mailbox that you can stick mail into but need a key to get it out of. Also tell her, in no uncertain terms, that if her dog keeps getting into your yard then you will call animal control and have them come out and talk to her every single time it happens. ",
            "Hah, you should buy a \"For Sale By Owner\" sign and put it in your front yard just to watch the inevitable freak out she has over it.",
            "Install security cameras all around your house immediately. Call animal control on her for having her dog loose. Document document document. I guarantee you she will escalate this further if you don't stop it now. She's crazy and obsessed. ",
            "Even if James never told her where his house was should could have found out through public records.\n\nI suggest some kind of security camera. The police might not do anything about the doorbell ringing but the postal service might be very interested that she's taking your mail. ",
            "/r/legaladvice \n\nI'm not an attorney or an expert by any means, but if I was in your shoes I\"d be looking into talking to attorneys or talking to police and trying to get a restraining order.  At this point, I feel like having an officer stop by and asking her if she's messing with you guys/touching your mail might be enough.\n\nAlso, you can get relatively cheap camera systems online.  I would put some cameras around the outside of your house.  Stealing mail is a really bad thing, she might end up getting some sort of personal info from it.",
            "I'm not sure why you think cameras are a bad idea. They are easy to install. You could even just put one in a window if you don't want to install outside.\n\nYou could also try putting a fake letter in the mailbox and see if she ends up with it.",
            "CCTV cameras. Apart from the stretching, the rest should be reported to the police as harassment. If you are in the US, isn't stealing people's mail is a federal office?",
            "I'd say it's time to call the non-emergency police line for your neighborhood, talk to someone there, and make a report about her behavior.  First, because the mail thing **is** illegal if she's taking it out of your box, and second, because you need to get ahead of this thing before she goes full-on crazy stalker lady.  Just for fun, and to make her insane, could you buy one of those mailboxes that locks and just has a slot for the mailman to drop your stuff?  There is no way that her moving in there and all the weird things suddenly happening are not connected.  I know they're minor things now, but they could easily get worse.  \n",
            "Firstly, you're not being paranoid. I'm willing to bet that your fianc\u00e9's ex moving to your neighbourhood was no coincidence, given how she reacted to their break-up. Her behaviour is seriously alarming and I'm convinced this \"annoyance\" will escalate into something more serious if you don't act now.\n\nSo yeah, definitely invest in security cameras for the doorbell/post stealing issues and if you can, take pictures of her while she's stood outside your house. Any evidence you can gather of her crazy behaviour will help when you take it to the police.",
            "It is not hard to find out if someone bought a house and where it is. I'm sure she just did that to find you guys.\n\nYou should report her dog being loose to animal control and the police. That's not ok.\n\nYou should call the post office and let them know you think this person is tampering with your mail. I'm not sure what they can do, but talk to them. If you have proof via cameras, they should know how to deal with it, because it is a crime. In the meantime, make as many bills as possible delivered electronically so you aren't dependent on the mail.  \n\nYou should install cameras like others are saying. Depending on what you see, you may want to show the police. \n\nYou should consider putting up a fence, if your dog is out and hers gets out, you can just ignore it and leave your dog in the fenced area.\n\nI'd talk to the police anyway. See what they need in terms of \"evidence\" of stalking and what your options are. \n\nShe's clearly nuts. A visit from the police might help. ",
            "It seems to take some time for you to realize your fiance's ex is full on stalking him, and has been for years. Please also realize that it's incredibly, incredibly easy to install cameras so that Brit can't see them (example: hidden cameras in regular objects, camera looking from your window to the mailbox, obscured place that has a good look there - James can easily distract her for minutes while you place it if you're unsure as to where she is/whether she's watching.)\n\nThis is all serious stuff (especially the mail - please understand it's not a minor offense or inconvenience, it's a very serious crime that needs to be reported!). If Brit wants to escalate, she'll escalate. Doesn't matter if you do something to \"cause\" it or not. Hey, she escalated to moving next to you, didn't she? You didn't do anything to cause that one, did ya.",
            "If the dog has picked up on the doorbell pattern then what's the harm in waiting by the door one night ready to open it as soon as you hear someone approaching? What's she going to say when you literally catch her in the act? Have cameras already installed before this happens. I mean ready to open the door before her finger leaves the button. If she's that fast she should be trying to leave as soon as the door opens. If you catch her just once maybe it will stop. The reason why the cameras are important here are so you can then leave a screen shot of herself in her mailbox telling her to stay off of your property or you will get the police involved. \n\nWhat about having sprinklers installed right at the edge of your property so if she feels like standing in your yard/drive and stretching for ten minutes go flip the switch and gently hose the bitch down. If she still stands there or continually comes back continue turning them on.  You aren't out there engaging her - it could be a timer. She doesn't know that. Hopefully the cameras catch her trespassing too in addition to the mail theft and harassment. \n\nAfter documenting all of these things get a restraining order, go after her for mail theft. Use the courts to make this nuisance disappear before she escalates.\n\nYes most people say don't engage with crazy- but how long do you want to live this way? Where your dog has anxiety over this idiot ringing the bell and coming into his safe space. Where your evenings are filled with stress and constantly interrupted. Where you can't look out the window without seeing her marching up and down your street or creeping in your yard/driveway. You can't even be in your yard in YOUR house without her stopping by with your mail or letting her dog loose on you \"by accident\". \n\nDo something or get used to living like this. If you uproot yourselves to get away she will too. ",

            "Former mail carrier here. So illegal! Call the postal inspectors (you can look up online or call your local PO and they will give you the number.) They will send inspectors out (you won't know when and they usually watched like a P.I., so she won't be aware either) and watch to see who's taking the mail. It's a federal expense, up to 5 years In jail and a fine. It's a felony, big NO NO. They don't take mail theft as a joke. ",
            "Do you know your neighbors well? I swear, when i was growing up, we had a man in our neighborhood who was pretty much ALWAYS watching if you gave him the hint of something strange going on. Even if you don't have a snoopy neighbor.

            "Besides the cameras, I would start doing monthly credit checks. She can ruin your credit really easily with a few credit card applications. I bet she already has your private info. Next get the USPS Inspectors involved. They will install a camera too. Also make a police report now, explaining the situation. Log everything and record anything you can. Once you start rejecting her, she might go into vindictive bitch mode. You will need every piece of information to protect you and you other half. \nI also recommend in indoor cameras.

Hell, you might even be able to get a sympathetic pest control company to help with cover for a small fee. Play it off, take your time hiding the cameras well, and catch her. (The idea only came up because our old neighbors had their place fumed and commented that it wasn't as expensive as it looked - and I get the sinking feeling that she is watching you guys far more often than you realize, and that you can't rely on just sneaking out there and getting them installed when she \"isn't looking.\" This could solve your problem if there's someone in your area willing to throw cover over part of your home for a few hours for a reduced fee and you're willing to do it.)

            "I know you're already scared and don't want to scare you further, but I just read this book called the \"gift of fear\" (highly recommend it) and one thing he keeps talking about is that people need a reason to be violent. There's always a justification, something that makes them feel like they have no other way to handle the situation. Because of this, you want to hold back your arsenal until you mean it. \n\nIf you call the police, they'll come to her door and talk to her and leave. So what does that show her? The police won't do anything except talk to her. If you go to court and get a restraining order, you leave with a flimsy piece of paper. These things won't do anything to actually stop her, but they may incite her. \"All I did was move into a nice house and walk my dog everyday. THEY sent the police after me. THEY dragged my name through the mud in court. THEY'LL pay for what they did\". You get the picture? \n\nIf you ignore her, she may move on. She walks outside? Let her. The dog gets out? Walk back inside. The doorbell rings? Keep eating dinner. If you take this approach though, you need to stick it out as long as it takes. If you stop answering after one doorbell, she'll ring twice. She'll ring later. She'll come in the middle of the night. If she leaves you 20 voicemails, and you answer on the 21st to tell her off, you teach her it takes 21 calls to get a response. Keep that in mind every time she reaches out!! She wants your attention and she wants it bad. ANY ATTENTION WILL DO. If you go and yell at her, you're doing exactly what she wants. \n\nSo my advice? Don't escalate unless something meaningful can happen. I like the advice to film her stealing mail; this may actually put her in jail. Anything else that will not take her away from you (speaking with the homeowners association, getting a restraining order, asking the police to talk to her) and will very likely result in a woman who's not just obsessed, but now also wronged.

We did the same thing for my wife when she was sick but then kept her on the low-iron vitamins and a later blood test showed her iron was ridiculously low. So check with your doctor about all this obviously, but I suggest just remember to switch back to the ones with iron once she stops feeling so sick (should be pretty soon, hang in there). \n\nAlso, from a new dad: enjoy the second trimester!

If mine got destroyed I wouldn't know what I'd do - it's somehow survived years of abuse and is still going strong.",

Secondly, with doctors approval, half a chewable Dramamine (orange flavored) before the meal and she'll be able to fall asleep and keep her food down. Last, believe it or not, Slim Fast (chocolate royal) has Vitamin K which is known to help relieve nausea in pregnant women. It's also full of nutrients and gentle on the stomach. Good luck!

We work in a very small department (for about 2 years now) and she is practically within arms length of me. Why cannot I not stand her? Well..\n\nShe talks all day long. To me, to others, to her sister on the phone, etc. If you don't talk to her, she gets her feelings hurt and then huffs and puffs all day long. Or she leaves and goes to some other department to talk about us. \n\nShe fights with someone at least once a day. Me, her husband, her sister, our boss. Speaking of which...\n\nIf I say \"it's a nice day out\" - I will get 100 reasons back on why it isn't a nice day. She can literally argue about anything with anyone. The one time I stopped the \"fight\" and told her I didn't care about what we were arguing about - she cried for the rest of the afternoon. \n\nI get constant commentary on my actions - especially with food (I am on a diet and SHOULD be). God forbid I don't eat the amount of food she thinks I should. It is like having the mother you never wanted telling you your not eating enough. OH...she is also a \"vegan\" (Except for the **bacon** she eats every morning). \n\nSo we get preachy commentary also about meat, straws, recycling, animals, tree-hugging (literally) etc. All while she eats bacon, uses 100 Styrofoam cups a day, has non-neutered pets etc. Basically shes a hypocrite. \n\nGotta go to the bathroom? Well you should have asked her also if she needed to go so you both could go together. If its time to go to a meeting together she will yell rudely \"are we going or not?\". She acts like we are all joined at the hip. \n\nAre you cold? Well she is colder. Are you sick? She's been sicker. Family member died? Well hers are deader. We are always in some weird competition with her. Especially if it has to do with being seen as small, sickly, victim-y. It is so bizarre. \n\n\nShe doesn't pull her weight at work. She is hidden from our bosses view - so she spends hours on her phone. If you try to get her to help out or cover for someone on vacation she gives about 100 reasons why she can't or just flat out doesn't do what she says she will. \n\nMy boss is useless in this situation (shes a pushover). I wear earbuds but we are so close that unless I blow out my eardrums, I can hear all of this. I am at the point where I am considering quitting over her. I am a really laid back, introverted person and she exhaust me. I get this dread on Sunday afternoon from having to be around her again. Anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with her. My job is otherwise a pretty sweet situation, I would like to keep it for awhile. Thanks!\n\nTLDR - How do you deal with a co-worker who gets under your skin like it's their job? \n\n\n\n",

            "Boundaries. You'll get HELLA push back at first but it's what you have to do. I had a boss that sounds a lot like this woman. \n\nMe, to co-worker: I have a headache, so glad today is done.\n\nBoss: Oh what *I* do is take Tylenol and then 2 hrs later take Ibuprofen. You need to do that. That's why your headaches keep coming back. You don't get rid of ALL the pain. Your posture is horrible too, it's like your head isn't even on your neck the way you're sitting, you should.....\n\nMe: I'm sorry, I was actually talking to Lina here. \n\nBoss: (Calls well after work hours with what should be a quick, legitimate question and then sits on the phone wanting to talk about her personal life for an hour if I let her.)\n\nMe: I was actually in the middle of dinner. I'm going to have to ask you to keep after hours calls quick and strictly work related when you need to make them. \n\nYou can apply this at work too. \n\nJane, I'm trying to concentrate on this. Would you mind finishing your call in the hallway please?\n\nJane, please stop commenting on my diet. My nutrition and weight are being monitored by a doctor and everything is fine. \n\nJane, your lifestyle choices are fine but they are YOUR lifestyle choices. Please stop criticizing mine. \n\nShe'll pout and cry. This is not your problem. Do not engage or debate after you've stated your boundary. If needed, restate it and then again, do not engage. \"Jane I've asked you several times to take personal calls away from our work area. It's distracting. Will you be able to do that or do we need to work with Boss to find a solution?\" \n\nIn my experience, 99% of the time people like this get so \"tired of everyone picking on them\" that they quit in pretty short order.",
            "\"Ask A Manager\" has many letters (it's an advice column) on pretty much this. But the gist of most of them is: \n\n1) Grey rock it, as others have said. Minimal, very neutral interactions. Make it hard for her to have \"fun\" or \"entertainment\" from you. \n\n2) If it's possible, do include her on your own terms. Maybe an email to the group every Friday, dropping off little things like a donut or a piece of candy, saying hi and bye, or whatever small things you can do. She sounds really lonely and tragic to me. \n\n3) Observe her behavior as if you were an anthropologist. \"See how Karen tries to establish dominance by saying her pets were buried in Pet Semetary and now she's not too sure about this new stray...\" Try to find the humor in it all. \n\n4) Let her be upset. She's an adult, don't try to fix it. She's punishing herself far worse than you ever could, trust me.  \n\n5) She if you can pinpoint the work-related cost of this. \"Boss, Karen is distracting and upsetting me and I've spoken to her more than once. I'm having trouble finishing...\" or \"I asked Karen to cover for me and she declined. She said she was having remora feed on her back that day. Anyhoo..\" Just give your boss the facts, if any, that make her an unsuitable worker. ",

            "\"Family member died? Well hers are deader.\" BA ha ha ha ha! \n\nOP, this is GOLD. But yeah, this must be unbearable As other commenters have said, you need to just gray rock her, and I guess start looking for another job since your boss is spineless and doesn't care. ",
            "You've gotten good advice, but I wanted to help you on the whole \"not blow out my eardrums\" thing.\n\nIf you go to whitenoisemp3s - dot - com, you need to download \"Rain on the River.\"  It is a fabulous track of white noise that is super effective at blocking noise at close distances.  Essentially, it's loud rain on a running stream, so there's lots of solid sound masking features, and since it is an hour long MP3, there isn't a \"seam\" to distract you.\n\nI've used this to help drown out my husband's snoring (which is now rectified I finally forced him into a sleep study and I don't know who is happier with his CPAP) with earbuds or headphones.  If it can help block that, it can help block a lot of her noise.",
            "If you're working for a bad boss, then the rest of the jib perks don't really matter. I have an amazing boss, and it makes me look forward to going to work every week. I don't think that, as a peer, there is any way you can get her to change her behavior. \n\nWhat you can do is move to a different desk (my boss did this...moved her desk out into the hall to get away from overly chatty people in the office, and it has made a world of difference). You can completely ignore your coworker. Sounds like it doesn't really matter if she's upset because you're not going to be reprimanded or told to change by any authority figures. \n\nI would just stop engaging. I would also find a new job. Having to carry a team members dead weight, while working for someone who won't help in any way, is just too much of a pain. Life is too short for that.",
            "Your options are\n\na) put up with it\n\nb) get a different job\n\nc) set boundaries and *don't let her feelings about it convince you you were wrong to set them*. \"I don't want to talk,\" \"I don't want to argue,\" \"I don't need advice on this,\" \"I'd rather not hear any more about this topic,\" \"that's none of your business,\" \"that's not your call,\" and \"give me privacy and personal space\"--these are all *completely normal and reasonable boundaries* which you've given up on defending because of her emotional blackmail. She's being *super extra inappropriate* and it is 100% okay to return awkwardness to sender and just *let her be unhappy*.\n\nThe obvious caveat is that she and anybody who has accustomed themselves to working around her personality will see you as the mean one. You have to weigh the potential consequences and how much that matters to you. Just remember that you aren't starting this. *She* has made you uncomfortable. You're not rocking the boat, you're refusing to stay in and help steady the boat that she's rocking. Staying quiet this long isn't keeping the peace; you haven't had any peace!

            "I worked w/ an older woman like this. Very opinionated and a hypocrite, extremely similar to what you wrote about. We worked in an EMERGENCY communications job and she straight up sucked. My work tortured me for 2 weeks on a night shift w/ her and made her my trainer in which she just made me do 100% of the work while she sat back on her phone. After I realized the kind of person she was, I stonewalled her. I gave her no fuel to talk to me. I heard she started talking shit about me behind my back from another co-worker but I didn't care. I didn't have to talk shit about her because everyone knew how she was already.\n\nI was lucky in the sense that this job was just a filler job for me after moving to another state. I was applying for other higher paying jobs to match what I had before because I took a pay cut taking the communications job. I would say if you can, apply for another job if you're forced to work w/ her. Having a co-worker like that on the same shift will never make you happy to come to work. The job itself wasn't even hard most days and had a lot of downtime. This lady just didn't have a life outside of work and thought her co-workers were her personal friends even though her personality was incredibly insufferable. She had multiple incidents that should've gotten her fired but upper management would never put their foot down.\n\nI found out after I left that job everyone else in the next few months did too, leaving her alone w/ just 1 new employee.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

If she's this annoying and underperforming, she's annoying to your boss, too.  So the way to get a pushover boss to act on this sort of thing is:\n\nA - Shorten the connection.  Make it more apparent over time, in a low-pressure way, the direct connection between Coworker and stuff that boss doesn't want.  Eg, casually mention more often the role coworker takes in distracting you, if she has questions send her directly to boss more, etc-- the exact form of this will vary widely, but find a way to \"help\" boss feel her direct impacts more, tai chi style.\n\nB - Lower the wall.  Decide what action you want to take, and put in the work of making it the path of least resistance for boss.  Eg, you want to move or have her be moved?  Have her fired (for cause)?  Document.  Find some awesome potential replacements and make sure boss meets them.  Put in a bit of extra work to show boss how you could totally move to this other thing.  \n\nC - Establish allies and social proof.  The more people who go to boss and make it clear that coworker is a problem (especially who join you and do A), the more gravity for your boss will be toward doing something.  One person pushing for action from a pushover will always be defeated (or thought of as \"making trouble\") against the option for inaction, but five people expecting action will make inaction feel really awkward.\n\nGood luck!",

I understand. \n* What it doesn't mean: I agree. \n* If she says: but you agreed (because you said \"ok\"), you can say that you said OK, but that OK doesn't mean that you agree. Leave it at that. Don't explain it. Keep it short. Don't keep repeating it. \n* Say it once, maybe repeat it once or twice, then leave it. Try it and see what works.

If you do so, do it short, neutral. \n* If you feel really nervous or mad, don't do it, but go away. You don't want her to see that she got to you. \n* Emotions feed her.

It tells her that her methods work, and she will continue to use them. \n\nThere is one risk: this can all make your day at work still all around her. If you notice that your day at work is not about work but still about her, then that's not good. If because of this, all you do is think about how to react to her, then it's not working.

It did snow over night? Streets were full, but in her region, the streets were UNUSABLE. \n\nAnyway, I've been through a couple of fights with her and witnessed more than enough fights with other corworkers.

She ceased all relations to this woman, openly maintained a \"we only talk about work related stuff\" policy, and it worked okay for her. Obviously the other woman made a big deal out of it with words like \"unprofessional\" \"borderline bullying\" and all that stuff, but it was more like an investment. The first weeks were hell due to the gossip from Eldery lady, but it toned down significantly as people got more than bored with her shit. \n\nSo, my experience with that (very ery sad) kind of person, ignore her. Any kind of approach to her behaviour will only be met with blocking, justifications, exaggerations, blaming you for beeing mean, etc. - just ignore her and keep communication on a business level.

It\u2019s worth asking- if your boss is so conflict-avoidant as to not do anything about this coworker, then moving you might be worth not having to have a further discussion about it!",
            "My son is engaged to marry a woman like your coworker. Burns bridges everywhere she goes from the sort of behavior you describe. My son can see that people don\u2019t like her, but defends it saying that they simply aren\u2019t comfortable with a person who demands that others be at their best. Ugh......",
            "Had this situation before. As far as I know, you are required to do a job. You are required to interact with her for work related purposes. You are not required to be her friend. If her conversation/interaction it doesn't have anything to do with work, then say...\"This doesn't have anything to do with work.\" and walk away/ tune her out.\n\nEventually, this person complained incessantly about a \"hostile work environment\". After several group meetings, enough of the group banded together to state that she was the only hostile in the work environment; after which she no longer interacted with anyone at all. She was let go in the next reduction-in-force cycle.",
            "\"I'm busy right now, can we talk later\" ... On repeat in many variations. \n\nGet noise cancelling ear buds and just plug your ears shut even if you're not listening to music, I would even listen to lofi/productive minimal type music to help reduce the stress this woman is putting on you. \n\nAsk boss to move your desk maybe? \nWhen I worked corporate I would straight  up tell people I'm busy, come back later or to not talk over me to go to the kitchen or somewhere else to have lengthy conversations.\n\nThen I got a few work from home days and my productivity almost doubled. No distractions or silly office meetings/politics to participate in. I also then became a freelancer and that changed my life and that company could no longer afford my rates as o resigned and worked on a contractual basis and for other companies.\n\nMaybe put your CV out and go on some interviews, can't hurt.\n\nShe sounds like she is draining the life out of you, good luck.\n\nEdit: Also she needs to be told to mind her own business... I wouldn't euphemise it ",
            "I don\u2019t have any advice for you, but I just want to say I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve got to deal with such an unpleasant person. She sounds like an absolute headcase. Best of luck, OP. ",
            "Have you considered getting your writing published because you're hilarious ",
            "God damn, this chick sounds annoying. ",
            "Malignant narcissist. I am sorry! I truly, truly am sorry! I pray you find relief!",
            "You already have great advice here so I'm not gonna add on that, but you said that the noise annoys you. Have you considered noise canceling earphones?\n\nThey're great and you can get mediocre ones for like 70$/\u20ac",

            "Okay, after reading that, I hate her too, if that makes you feel any better. \n\nYou can document her poor work habits, paying special attention to errors, delays and any mistake that costs the company money to fix. \n\nYou can look for another position within the same company. Is there something else? Best case scenario, you get a promotion and become her boss. Heh. \n\nTry talking to your pushover boss and when she does nothing, go on up the ladder to her boss and so on. \n\nDo not bother with HR unless you find something that someone can sue the company over. HR is not in the business of helping employees. HR is in the business of making sure the company doesn't get sued. ",
            "Well, if you're already willing to quit over this, I say it's OK to test some new boundaries and see if it gets better. That said, when you first set these new boundaries, know that things will probably get worse before they get better. \n\nGrey rocking her is going to be a big one. Just \"uh huh\" and \"mhm\" and \"sorry gotta get back to work now\" in response to just about everything she says.\n\nWhenever you can, copy your boss on emails between you two, so they are aware of the situation to whatever extent they can be. Especially on follow ups between conversations where she's supposed to do things and you think she won't follow through. \"Hey coworker, just wanted to follow up on our meeting this afternoon where it was decided you would do X.\" And then confirm the email if it's something in advance. \n\nThere will probably be a bit of an extinction burst. Be prepared for her to go to your boss about your change in behavior. Don't tell your boss that you're grey-rocking her, just tell your boss you've been really trying to concentrate on your work. ",
            ">she is also a \"vegan\" (Except for the bacon she eats every morning).\n\nThis alone was enough to make me dislike her.",
            "Pick and choose your battles. Sounds like she is going to talk about you and piss and moan, one way or the other. So, why let her get to you?? Ignore her. Let he talk about you and your co-workers. You all know she's a toad. don't give her the gift of your attention.",
            "Out of curiosity, have you or has anyone ever called her out on the hypocrisy?  Bacon and styrofoam cups and stuff?  How does she respond?",
            "I had an incessant talker at work. She wasn\u2019t a bad person, she just really liked going on about nothing all the time. I didn\u2019t really know how to deal with her so at one point whenever I was done listening to the 4th repeat that day about how her future kids with her future husband might turn out ginger despite her being a dark Italian, I\u2019d just start putting headphones on my head. She got the hint and got better about it eventually (mainly we moved offices so we don\u2019t share anymore, but I\u2019m one of the few people she won\u2019t visit in another office just to talk at now).\n\nIf you want a recommendation for some great noise cancelling headphones, I really like the Sony wh1000XM3, Bose QC35ii is also decent. If you\u2019re on a stricter budget, Sony h.ear on 2 (WH-H900N) are much cheaper and aaaalmost as good.\n\nAll of the above are large over ear \u201cfuck off Karen I\u2019m working don\u2019t bother me\u201d headphones, as well as being able to reduce the noise from Karen\u2019s loud ass phone calls.\n\nHave you complained to your boss that she\u2019s on the phone all day? Maybe request to move to a *quieter* desk?",
            "So, I had an insufferable asshole know-everything jerk (being nice here) for a cubemate for a few years, he was the male version of this.\n\nTwo things that worked for me.\n\nOne, big massive fuckoff headphones.  We call them fuckoff headphones because when you wear them, it sends the signal to others to literally fuck off, I'm busy.  If she keeps interrupting you with your headphones, you can say something along the lines that you need the sound isolation, and when you have these headphones on, to leave you alone.  I had to tell a few people including him that the headphones mean don't bother me.\n\nTwo, don't speak to her.  First tell her you're not going to argue with her, or some way tell her she's not invited into conversations just because they occur within a 10 foot radius of her.  Then ignore everything she says.  I dealt with my annoying coworker like this.  A few times I told him this conversation wasn't his concern.  He didn't take the hint, and would butt in all the time, so I would talk over him when he jumped into a technical discussion that didn't concern him but occurred within earshot of him.  After a few days of that, he got the hint, even though being polite didn't work.",
            "I'm new to how to deal with difficult coworkers so I feel your pain. I don't think gray rocking works on coworkers as they think ignoring is rude. So try an alternative like only talking to her she has to do work related to you. Ask her feedback on her opinion on tasks, and see if you can get her to do her work that way. \n\nThe other thing is looking busy and just not being as available to her. Tell her your working on something and have to concentrate to get something important done. So both boundaries are an absolute must. Also is one reason why I don't like small offices, too much in your business.\n\nI wish you the best of luck, I think you need to just readjust your responses and make it set stone (don't worry about her reaction, your goal is to put a lock on her).",
            "You need to use your employment as leverage\n\nFind a palatable way to phrase it to your boss that this person is making your work experience unejoyable to the extent that you are reconsidering working there altogether. If your boss is worth a hill of beans, they will let the incompetent and cancerous employee go to save the good one.",
            "There are a lot of fabulous comments here about how to grey rock this narcissist.  They are all worthwhile.\n\nIf I were you, I would do all these things plus look for another job.  Grey rocking someone is tiring and not really a great way to live.  Even if you can keep her on the range, you're still missing out on the opportunity to work next to someone (at another job) who is fun and interesting and brings positive energy.  My 2 cents.",
            "I work with someone who's luckily really sweet, but she does talk almost constantly.  It's like the internal ticker in her brain just all comes out of her mouth.  It's so exhausting.  When I can't take it anymore, I put on my noise cancelling earbuds and tell her to \"wave\" if she needs me.  She goes \"okay bye!!!\" and I usually get 45 minutes or so of peace before she finds some \"emergency\" to interrupt me with.  That helps keep me sane, but I'm also job hunting lol.  ",
            "It helps to have somebody to vent to. I don\u2019t mean a coworker of course but an SO, friend of family member you can call up and say \u201cyou won\u2019t BELIEVE what she did today!\u201d Having somebody you can laugh with about the absurdity of her comments makes it more amusing and less frustrating. I had a coworker I hated and I tried this. Soon I was eavesdropping on their conversations so that I could run home and tell my husband another funny story about them. ",

            "Gonna play devil's advocate here. defs gonna get crucified.\n\nI can guarantee you that your boss isn't doing anything about your coworker because this is the type of shit that a boss can't do anything about, and nor should they. \n\nSo, your coworker is a chatty in the worst ways. So what? Are they a bad/evil/malicious person? Does your coworker steal? Physically abuse you? No? Then it's you, OP, that needs an attitude adjustment. Take this opportunity to learn how to be a social chameleon, to get along with everyone. It'll make the workplace better, and will make you a better person for it. \n\nIs she disruptive and interrupting your work day? Learn how to handle those situations tactfully, and politely. If that doesn't work, try smth different without being mean to them the next day. You'll figure it out. But adjust your own attitude, because you can only count on yourself and your own actions and opinions to actively change to make this (and any) situation better.\n\n",
            "My first thought was::: tell her what a crappy day it is outside, maybe she'll say it's a nice day.\nMy second thought was::: tell her it's much too quiet in the office and you wish she would talk to you more. I dunno if any of that works, but that's what came to mind.\nAnd, don't quit your job. You probably need that job even if she lives another hundred years. Keep looking for answers. Save the extreme measures for later. Give yourself time to let your mind find the correct answer.\nAnother thing, and this is a stretch of my imagination for sure::: maybe ask her to hang out after work one night. see if you can find something you like about her, and then try to get her to develop that thing, whatever it may be. she might need a hobby, something to fill up her mind with besides gossipping and yaking.\nAlso!! ::: maybe if she develops trust in you, you could start recording her and then in a week or so play it back. Make her listen to herself. She might start to hate her own voice if she has to hear it the way you do. Might cause her to want a personality  makeover.",

There was a lot of really solid advice (and one creepy PM warning me that by dressing in business attire and wearing lipstick and heel I was being overly sexual around my child and that would turn my son into a serial killer. Stay gold, reddit)\n\nA couple of clarifying points\n\n* My MIL did work when my husband was growing up, she just did not have an office job. She works in a medical field and wears scrubs everyday. When she's not in scrubs, she's in sweatpants. Seriously. For our wedding, his family started a pool about whether or not she would wear sweats to the wedding.\n\n* I did not suddenly get sexy after my son was born. I was slightly overweight before my son was born and I'm back to my pre-baby slightly overweight shape.\n\n\nNow the update:\n\nDan and I went out without our son so we could talk. I told him that I was confused by his comment and I wanted to talk about it. I asked him if he could name specific things about the morning routine that made him feel as though our son was neglected. I offered to \"switch shifts\" so to speak if he though our son should have more AM parent time. To make a long and confusing conversation short- Dan's confused by the fact that I got over my postpartum depression and am back to normal now. For some context, my PPD never made me question whether or not I loved my son or made me feel like we never should have had him. My PPD made me feel like I was constantly failing my son, that I wasn't good enough to be his mom and that he deserved better. There were a few times I broke down and started crying and would tell Dan that he was so much better at being a parent than I was and that our son didn't deserve to have a shitty mom like me. Luckily, I have an amazing DR who recognized that this wasn't just baby blues and helped me get the help I needed. It could have been much worse.\n\nBasically, Dan only felt like a good parent when I was failing and telling him that I was terrible at it. Now that I'm doing better, he no longer feels like a good dad. It's shitty, but we're staring couple counseling, I'm continuing with the counseling I started for my PPD and Dan's going to see someone too. We're going to figure it out. And I'm still going to wear heels to work even though it's going to turn my son into an axe murderer.\n\nTL;DR- My husband felt inadequate once I dealt with my postpartum issues and tried to undermine me to feel better. We're getting counseling and my baby is going to be a serial killer.\n\n\nEdit-words are hard.\n",

It's pretty common to feel like you aren't doing a good job with your new kid, but when he had you reassuring him that he was an amazing dad all the time (just to clarify, don't change a thing, this isn't your fault) he felt like he had it together at least to you. Now that you aren't struggling, he probably compares himself to you and thinks he's lacking. There are other explanations obviously, but that's a very common one.\n\nI'm glad that you both will be addressing this in therapy, and I expect you'll see improvement soon. :)",

I don't know if the first profile just wasn't working or if Reddit just came to my rescue, haha.  Doesn't really explain the lack of OKC success, but I'm planning to start that up again too.\n\nThe main thing was that I talked to my friend.  I asked her for some advice on how to fix my looks.  She was really, really harsh about it.  She said it was doubtful I could fix things, that she felt sorry for me, that escorts were expensive but she'd front me the money if I wanted to lose my virginity (WTF?).  I decided I didn't need her in my life.  It sucks, because she was pretty much my only friend.\n\nI gave myself a look in the mirror and decided that I'm not all that ugly.  Sure, I'm not beautiful like my friend is or like a lot of girls on this college campus, but I'm okay.  I'm a good person, I have something to offer, and I'll just keep searching.  There's no point in crying over the opinion of someone mean like my friend.  I may not be a fitness model or beauty queen, but I'm okay.  \n\nI had a conversation with one of my Tinder matches and he seems genuinely nice, so I'll see how that goes.\n\nI am going to put in some more effort into my face and body.  I think exercise would help me.  I'm not about to sculpt myself or anything right now, but jogging a few times a week seems like a good start.  And I'm about to go to the drugstore and buy myself a couple more pieces of makeup, maybe a new cardigan or two.  We'll see how it goes.\n\n  \n**tl;dr**: Friend was a bitch, found a couple tinder matches, going to try to be comfortable in my own skin.",

            "Great to see that you ditched her, she seemed more critical than helpful. That escort comment was way out of order too. \n\nI'm so glad that things are looking up for you, and I wish you all the best for the near future :)",

            "Good for you!   At the end of the day you want someone who wants you for all that you offer.  Not just looks.  Personality, integrity, compassion and intelligence is what helps build a lasting relationship.  Not cleavage and a perky ass.  While you are dating do not sell yourself short or accept treatment that is less than what you want because you're afraid you won't find another.  You sound great, good luck!",
            "That's nice to read!\n\n\n*I may not be a fitness model or beauty queen, but I'm okay.*\n\nI think this is very important. Listen, I do not know how you look like, so I won't make any comments like \"You are beautiful\". Eventually, it doesn't really matter, really.\n\nWhen I was younger, I was obsessed with not being pretty enough. And I thought, if I just got prettier, everything would be alright. I surely am not a conventionally beautiful girl, but much, much prettier. And guess what? It didn't solve anything.\n\nSociety makes you believe that everything is or can be beautiful. I don't think this is true; but I think that it does not matter. We make \"being beautiful\" a much more important trait than it actually is. I mean, it's mostly genetics, really.\n\nThere are things we have control over. Whether we are kind, open- minded, ambitious, sympathetic etc. Those are things to be aware of.\n\nI hope you find a way being comfortable in your skin.\n\nI personally still like to indulge in \"beauty stuff\". I like learning new stuff about make up, or buying new clothes where I feel \"pretty like them\". Because it makes me remember that they are not better than me. And it is not about being better anyway, but.. You are good enough the way you are.\n\nI hope actively doing something for your body will help you feeling more comfortable in your skin. Maybe it'll have the side effect of people becoming more aware of you, but even if not- this is about you, not about them.\n\nI don't know whether you are beautiful, but I know that you are great and that you are good enough the way you are. And I hope you learn to see that, too!",
            "I'm glad that things are looking up for you, you do you :)\n\nPs: I still think you're pretty",
            "I'm glad you posted an update, I have been thinking about this since I read your first post.\n\nI'm not a particularly attractive person - not repulsive, but definitely not pretty and also kind of butch, and really not photogenic at all. When I was maybe 19 or 20 (like, more than a decade ago) my favorite uncle said something that really stuck with me - he said it about someone else, but I sort of think he meant it about me too. As a casual aside about another girl of similar age, he said \"Yeah, she hasn't really grown into her looks yet, has she?\"\n\nThe point being that you get what you get, bone-structure-wise, and if you don't win the lottery there (or if you get something kind of weird), it can take a while to figure out how to optimize what you have. Whether this includes makeup, or hairstyle, or just what kind of expression you tend to have on your face.\n\nExercise is great because muscle tone and good circulation will make you look better and feel happier. Running is fine, but doing a balanced whole-body workout is better. Like a Jillian Michaels video, she's got some short ones. Or Nia Shanks has some stuff.\n\nEating a good diet is good too - again not necessarily for \"weight loss\" per se, but for general health. People seriously look different and better if their nutrition is better. I'm sure you've seen people who are heavier people but beautiful and glowing with health, and also people of various sizes who are flabby and kind of grey and unappealing.\n\nProfile-wise, I would focus on pointing out what you are bringing to the table. Going on dates, I would focus on remembering to cultivate an actual interest in the person you're on a date with, even if it only lasts through coffee. It will be more fun, and also more likely to lead to more dates.\n\nsource: not pretty, got plenty of guy attention, happily married to a catch",
            "She was not your friend but just using you to make sure she gets all the attention. Good on you for dumping her. Removing her from your life will improve your self-esteem and confidence.",
            "It's good to hear that things are looking up :) \n\nThere are definitely a lot of guys that I know, who care a lot more about how awesome a girls personality is than her looks (although I'm sure you look stunning :) ). People who are transitioning out of teenage hood can be quite fickle; but the right guy is definitely out there! Good luck :)",
            "I know that this seems like a lie, but really, looks aren't everything and depending on the outfit, makeup, confidence and other factors, almost any person can be either a 4 or an 8.\n\nFirst of all, being sexy is an attitude. It's far more of an action than it is a quality. I often marvel at my SO's ability to just make me crazy for her.\n\nSecond, start looking for people in places that makes it more likely to connect, based on your personality and interests. I met my SO while starting my engineering degree and it makes a lot of sense that I met an awesome girl who is smart, likes gaming as much as I do and has a deep personality in there. Certainly, it would have been far more unlikely to meet her in a bar, mainly because *we both don't like going to bars*.\n\nThird, Kudos for ditching your shitty \"\"friend\"\". Time to make new ones. There are a lot of people who are not that bitchy or that shallow.\n\nFourth, is a great thing to put effort in yourself. Being healthy and toning your body a little is great. Just don't bother in becoming someone you are not. If you act like yourself, you will find people who likes you for what you are. That is the best you can hope for.",
            "Good update, I'm glad things are looking up. I'll give you a bit of advice though about weight-loss. You don't exercise your way to fat-loss, just like you can't diet your way to fitness. \n\nWeight loss is really just about diet. Running a mile burns about 100 calories, that's around 2 Oreo cookies. You can see that if you want to lose weight you aren't going to do it by running. As far as diet goes, I like /r/leangains some people like /r/paleo or /r/keto. \n\nBest of luck. ",
            "Check out /r/makeupaddiction \nThe people on there are so nice and helpful. They'll give you great tips, judgement free. ",
            "I know you said you were intimidated by r/makeupaddiction but I promise if you post asking for help and basic tutorials they will be happy to assist you! \n\nAnd great idea jogging. If you're not good about self discipline think about joining a running club! \n\nAlso. Who doesn't love a new cardigan? Go girl!\n\nBut the important thing to remember is that all these things are going to do WAY more for how you feel than how you look. And that's ok! You have to love yourself first. \n\nGood luck with those tinder matches! Keep trying ",
            "It's going to be much easier for you to address whatever issues you have with your appearance that it will be for your ex friend to address that black pit of hers that she calls a soul.\n\nI love your can-do, positive attitude.  You're going to do well.",
            "Don't start with the drug store make up, go to the department store and ask someone at a counter for help. They will teach you how to properly apply make up along with finding the exact colors that go with your skin tones. Usually they will do a full make up application for you for free, but will expect you to purchase product. Don't feel obligated to buy everything they use. \n\nEdit- spelling",
            "Whoa, escorts?  What?  Um, you do not need that biotch in your life, you're right!  Good for you for getting rid of that baggage!\n\nNow.  Can we talk makeup?  Because I freaking love makeup.  I love the textures, the colors, the sounds the little plastic cases make when they click together...LOVE IT.  I don't wear it on a daily basis because I love sleep more than I love makeup, but when I really want to indulge myself and feel super beautiful (I have meh/okay looks, really), I pluck my eyebrows and put on a subtle face with some fun eyeshadow and I feel like a million bucks.  I would love, love, love to chat with you about it!",
            "Get fit OP.  Not only will it help in the attractiveness area, but it also demonstrates a capacity for self-control, discipline, and a healthy lifestyle.  You'll also feel loads better from the endorphins, and probably meet new people at the gym.  \n\nGlad to hear your having some success now.  Even you're only getting a trickle of interest, don't sell your short for a creep.",
            "Awesome! Tinder came through for you! :D just remember if it doesn't work out with this guy there will be others.\n\nI bet if you join a club on your campus you can find a few new friends, too. It's KEY to find people who are kind and who support you. Nearby or even on the internet. \n\nYou can do this - get fit, find your own style, celebrate your beauty and enjoy being YOU. I'm so glad you're not letting the bastards get you down anymore. ",
            "WTF? I don't think that person was ever your friend. Sounds like she needed to put you down to feel good about her own shitty self image.",
            "Some of us don't photograph well. Consider getting a professional photographer to take a good pic of you to use on Tinder. Frontal shots usually don't look that great, but a three quarter view does. Maybe you have a friend who is into photography and can do this for you.\n\nAlso consider something like meetup.com where you can join some clubs and meet people in person. Personality trumps looks. But it helps to dress decently and be groomed. Don't overdo.\n\nGood that you're starting an exercise program. It will boost your confidence. If you join a gym you might get to meet people. ",
            "For whatever it's worth, I think the internet dating just kind of comes and goes in waves. I'm a 30M and I've been using OKC on and off for like 5 years, Tinder for six months. I'll go through stretches where nobody \"likes\" me, nobody chooses me, and nobody responds for my messages...only to be followed by a period where I'm kind of overwhelmed with matches.\n\nIn six months on Tinder I only had like four or five matches and nobody wanted to actually have a conversation once we were matched. However, in the last two weeks I've gotten eight matches and have met up with three people. No explanation as to why it was not happening for so long, nor for why it suddenly started happening.\n\nI guess the bottom line is that neither service is a reliable indicator for a person's worth or attractiveness. Focus on being happy with yourself for yourself and the dates will follow. Good luck!",
            "I didn't see your OP or update back when you posted them (I've read them now) but I'll give a little unsolicited advice. Regarding exercise: I don't know about you, but I think running is just about the worst thing ever. The way I got into shape was rock climbing (there are indoor gyms and your school may even have their own rock wall. It is wicked fun it hardly feels like a workout and works so many muscles (legs, abs, back, arms). The great thing about it is anyone of any ability level can do it because the routes are graded according to difficulty. It's also a great way to meet people.\n\n\n\n\nMakeup: I always thought my makeup was fine, but I learned some tips and techniques by going to Sephora (other places probably offer the same or similar services). Sephora has this cool thing where they use a scanning wand to figure out the exact skin color you have, then it matches to foundation colors that they sell (so go with no foundation on). Also if you spend $50 there they'll do your makeup where they do one half of your face and teach you how, then you do the other half to practice. Go in and take advantage of the sales people - in my experience they are helpful and not pushy, just tell them what you are looking for, and if you don't know, just admit that \"I'd like to start using makeup to better compliment my features but I don't know where to start.\"\n\n\n\nI'm glad you cut that mean \"friend\" out. Friendships should make you feel better, not worse.",
            "Just remember that, while people do find relationships on Tinder, it's not exactly designed for that and may not be the best place to look for a meaningful connection with someone. Best of luck!",

            "Really pleased you're taking positive steps and that you got rid of your mean friend. \n\nI've always been a firm believer in it being personality you fall in love with. Yes, a lot of the time it's on packaging that attracts the eye but it's the personality that keeps you interested. Your friend is a good example. By her standards she's good looking but her personality is butt ugly.  \n\nYou sound like a lovely person and very humble.  Read any amount of fashion or beauty articles etc and they'll tell you how to maximise your assets. Find clothes that match your physique, hair style that matches your face, make up that compliments your colouring etc.  \n\nI've met many people who I thought were a bit below my physical standards on initial meeting but found them to be great people and that alone made them above average attractive. \n\nYour friend can go to hell with her unhelpful comments. \n\nGood luck. ",

            "Great update!  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  I think you're doing the right thing: cutting out a \"friend\" who brings you down and focusing on looking your best in a way that is comfortable to you.\n\nI see so many women these days with tons of make-up, fake hair, fake tans but they still look ugly to me because they are mean, superficial and shallow.  There is nothing wrong with taking care of your body but real beauty comes 100% from within.",
            "Is there a sephora near you? They can teach you how to put on make up and then you can go and buy cheaper stuff at a drug store.

We've all had to learn who makeup, clothing, hair styles, ETC will accentuate our features, and some people start learning a little bit later. There is **nothing** wrong with that.\n\n You sound like a good person - which makes you truly beautiful. :)\n",

            "I didn't see your first two posts, but I think you can kill several birds with one stone. Join a dance class. You'll get exercise, it will get you out of your comfort zone for a while, you'll meet men, you'll hopefully find you enjoy it, you'll learn a new skill and it will help you feel good about yourself.

I mean, it's possible that she could be that dumb/clueless, but it's just too callous to be ignorance.

Good job OP. You're gonna be a great catch for someone.",
            "One suggestion: Try a serious online dating platform (whatever that is in the states). I found my match on \"FriendScout\", but I think that is German only. I met some cool people through that website and I just checked that they even host single parties and have a date roulette (like tinder with the swiping) as well as regular dating with messages and stuff. See if something like that exists for your area. I think Tinder is just \"wanna fuck?\" mostly and there looks matter even more than on regular dating sites. Your former friend was kind of an ass.  \n  \nOf course there are a lot of things you can do if nature has not blessed you with super good looks, like taking good care of yourself, but staying mostly natural, exercising, subtle makeup, clothing, behaviour...I know the last one sounds hard, but you simply need to show some self-confidence, be funny, open, approachable. Sooner or later you will find someone. Sure you won't be banging every dude that comes around. My friends got girls pretty regularly when we were younger, I never did. I had terrible Akne and I'm not a Brad Pitt by any stretch of the imagination + I've put on weight as well over the years.  \n  \nOnline Dating is also a hit and miss, you need to realize that a lot of the dudes are either dicks or won't answer, it's worse when you're a guy seriously. I've sent messages to dozens, nay hundreds of women, got only a handful of responses and only 2 or 3 went further than 1 date, but no sex, until I met someone I have now been with for over 3 years.  \n  \nSo, chin up, and at em. Plastic surgery is a possibility if you really want to (I have not seen your face, so...) but it should be a last possibility.",

            "Is there a sephora near you (Make up store)-go in and ask for a consult-tell them you have never worn much make up and you want a good every day look that will maximize your good points and minimize your bad-if there is something specific you want to highlite or low light mention it.\n\nAsk them what they are putting on you and what it does, how to do it.  They will give you a product list at the end. Ask them what the three most important things to buy are and, if you LOVE them, buy them. \n\nDont buy mascara-drug store mascara is every bit as good as high end mascara.  Probably buy some foundation, blush and maybe a good lip glass and pencil.  If you have good skin you won't need a concealer-if you have uncooperative skin get the concealaer instead of blush and buy drug store blush.\n\nYou NEED the sponge the use to apply the foundation or it won't blend properly. Go out and get your brows shaped ($11 ish-if your brows are very pale get them tinted too (and extra 18-20).  Shaping your brows properly can change your whole face-it will last about 2 months-then you can decide if you want to do it on your own or keep getting it done.\n\nIf there is not a spehora try Ulta (not quite as good)\nMake up is expensive-dont be surprised if your foundation costs $40-but it will last a full year.  There is also $100 foundation-I don't think they will test that on you but ask the price of the product and feel free to tell them thats too much.\n\nDo you like your hair cut? Is it easy to take care of-blow out, straighten, curl?  If you get a good hair cut it should only take you about 20 minutes to be in 'go out ready' shape-if you have a bad haircut or no shape to your hair no matter how much time you spend you won't like it.\n\nThis is mainly about you-to encourage you to make an investment in YOURSELF-for yourself, not for anyone else.  You are young now and your only responsibility is to yourself.  If you don't make an investment in your self and spend time on yourself now you never will-and you ARE worth it (Believe me when kids come a long later in life all you will have in your closet is comfy clothes-covered with spit up-take advantage of your independence now!)  Also-its true that when we feel better about our looks we feel more confident and that pays off big time in our relationships with other people and how we present ourselves.\n\nFinally-think of three things that interest you and try them out-ever want to be a gourmet cook-watch something on food network and then try the recipe-rock climbing look interesting?  Sing up for your local class.  Love animals-volunteer at a shelter.\n\nI think you are definitely on the right track after perhaps being more passive in the past-you are being more proactive now-just bump it up a notch.\n\nAnd your ex friend was an asshole-there is a way to give constructive criticism and she missed the mark so much she ended up in another galaxy ",
            "good luck!!! :D ",
            "You sound strong and mature. Glad you did not let the bitch get under your skin. She sounds awful, congrats on getting rid of her. ",
            "(((hugs)))\n\nON the drugstore makeup thing - call your local dept store that has makeup counters (macys, dillards, nordstroms, etc) or MAC/Sephora - and set up a free makeover.\n\nThey will do your makeup for free.  They will show you colors that might work for you.  If it doesn't feel comfortable, don't buy it, and don't get pressured into buying anything you don't want.\n\nHaving an impartial 3rd party to do the makeup really helps.  ANd be honest - \"I'm new at this and don't know what to do.  I need some tips\".\n\nAs for the ex-frenemy - you're in college - get involved and make new friends.  Join a club (D&D is fun! or a language club).  Try a sport (Rowing was a blast, and track is great for stamina) You will meet new people who are intelligent and interesting.  And at least 50% will be nicer than the bitch.\n\nYou go girl!",
            "Your \"friend\" is a complete bitch and you don't need friends like that in your life.  \n\nTry not to put so much pressure on yourself.  You have lots of time left to meet guys and have fun.  If you want to meet friends (guys and girls) why not try some campus groups? Or there are sites like MeetUp etc., which organize different events.  ",
            "One quick piece of advice, beware of starting your exercise routine with jogging. That's really hard on joints, etc. Building up your muscles first is important. Start walking, walking fast, or swim or ride a bike. There is no hurry here--you need to exercise the rest of your life. Start modest and take your time to build up and you are more likely to stick with it than if you aim for quick results and hurt yourself early on.",
            ">going to try to be comfortable in my own skin.\n\nThis is the most important thing. Self-confidence will help you make friends too (real ones - that girl was not your friend). Good luck OP, you sound like you've got this figured out.",
            "Good for you! Don't worry about what your friend said, that just seemed so unnecessarily mean. She wasn't being honest, she was being bitchy. \n\nJust light makeup, a cool hairstyle and flattering clothes can completely alter your appearance. Have fun trying out new styles! See what works best for you and run with it.",
            "I'm glad you got rid of a toxic friend! If you ever need any help with makeup or exercise, feel free to PM me. :D I used youtube to learn makeup and I am also a certified personal trainer. Jogging is awesome but if you ever want to switch things up, try adding in some HIIT (like sprint intervals) or plyometrics. Your positive attitude is wonderful and I really hope you have success with Tinder. :)\n\nEDIT: spelling",
            "Aw you seem sweet, you'll find a guy soon.  So many *bitches* out there that are just not a lot of guys (me included) types.",

            "I'm like your friend. Blunt/honest, and I wouldn't care much for your opinion as you would have asked for mine. The fact you ditch someone after asking them is pretty funny, but people are soft I suppose.",
            "You do realize that Tinder is the most superficial of all the dating sites, right? If online dating is your thing, try a pay site, the only couples I know IRL that have met on dating sites met on the premium ones.",

It's wonderful, but when you're looking for one star, and you've got an entire sky full of them? It makes it difficult for a particular, unmotivated romantic. "
