You guys really opened my eyes and gave me the strength to change my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo i was able to see my college's psychologist, even though it took me alot of time to get an appointment because i didn't have a phone. I explained them the situation and they immediately took things seriously. I was also able to see a social worker who helped me get a residence room. So i moved out last Wednesday. Unfortunalety, my familly ended up findng me the day i moved out. No need to explain how terrible that day was. So i'll have to move out again very soon which is good. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm not gonna lie, im completely terrified now that im just by myself. I feel so alone and scared because  i don't have a home, nor anyone i can count on blindly, you know. Like someone who got my back when i need to. I've always been that type of person who's always on their guard. Now its even worse, and the fact that my family knows where i currently live doesn't help at all. I only go out when i really need to. But i know its just a phase  and it will pass. I just need to get used to this new life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou guys really changed my life and im more than thankful and grateful for that!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n TL;DR: Finally got myself away from my toxic family.",

            "Congrats OP, you made the first big step to getting control over your life! I know this is all scary and your right it will pass. Take some time to make a list of goals for the next few months. Getting copies of all your legal documents if you didn't have a chance to get them. Open your own bank account, start looking for a job, ect. I don't know about you but the fear of doing adult things went away for me when I just pushed myself to do it. And don't be afraid to ask people for help, look into whatever resources you can. You got this!",
            "You are very brave, OP. Doing things that are scary because you know they are the right thing to do is very brave. Don't forget that.\n\nMaking new friends is also scary, but would do you a lot of good, I think. Are there any clubs or groups at your college you could join? One way to make friends is finding people with similar interests, and clubs are a good way to do that.",
            "Keep going back to that psychologist when you need help. There may be other programs out there that can help you get back on your feet. You took the first step, don\u2019t let them take you back. If your family convinced you to come back that would only make everything worse and show them that you can be controlled. Continue to act like an adult it sounds like it would be better to live in a shelter than under their roof.",
            "Now that you've gotten out of the house, it would be VERY beneficial to open your own bank account and get a job. Start saving money just incase you need to move further away/move in general. Financial stability/independence would probably be the best thing to focus on along with continuing with the psychologist. Besides that, find some friends on campus you can depend on. There are 100% people out there who you will be able to lean on. Positivity leads to more positivity, so keep your head up and just move forward. Only have one life, make the most of it now that you've taken the first steps to freedom.",
            "There are two main credit reference agencies in the UK (where I am based) and I believe they are global, so almost certainly also covering France. They are Equifax and Experian. What you should do is write to them (email will do fine) and tell them that you have recently escaped a controlling family (give them your name, former and current address and date of birth) and that you believe that there may be bank accounts, credit cards and possibly other financial products in your name that you never agreed to and have never had access to. Ask to put a password on your credit file. That means if you do apply for anything and they run a credit check, a screen will come up with a phone number for the organisation to contact. They'll ask for you to be put on the phone to give your password before they'll open new lines of credit. Pick a random word that your family will never guess.\n\nObtain copies of your credit history from both organisations and go through them, and contact any banks etc that show up to tell them about fraudulent activity. Depending on what you unearth it may also be necessary to contact the police. Don't worry, the institutions are used to this sort of thing, and you categorically are an adult under French and European law. If anyone has used your name to obtain funds fraudulently, or your former child status to evade taxes or launder money, that is not your fault, but you should make efforts to stop it as quickly as possible.",

This is an extremely important time to build the foundation of what you want out of this life . Make a list , take some time for yourself and never stop reaching out . I have faith in you and I hope you know I am pulling for you .",
            "Well done for moving out. It's a big scary step but remember that what you think of as someone having your back wasn't really true. Your family only had their own backs and they were abusive to you.  Being on your own can seem really scary but you can always ask friends or your neighbors if you're really stuck. Most other people are super nice and kind, despite all the suspicion your parents gave you. Yes there some who aren't but most people do help others out if they're having trouble.",

You are a courageous woman to say the least and you should be proud of yourself for that alone. I would continue seeing that psychiatrist and try and find interests/hobbies with which to make some friends with. It won\u2019t be too hard. Please don\u2019t overthink that. You\u2019ve had a rough life, don\u2019t make it harder because of your mind alone. Good luck.",
            "I am so glad you got out. I hope you have at minimum all the things you need to be independent:\n\n* ID card/driver's license\n* Passport\n* Bank Account (Open this in your name only at a bank your family doesn't use)\n* Credit Card\n* Cell Phone\n* Computer with reliable internet access\n\nI would also check your credit report to ensure that any accounts or cards your family opened in your name are closed. You might also want to get a restraining order if your family continues to harass you. And of course get a job. Getting a job will both make you financially independent and be a place to make new friends. \n\nWhile it may be scary now, just know that you are on the start of an amazing journey. You get to choose the path and the goals. You already showed amazing bravery in leaving your toxic family. You have what it takes to succeed and be happy. Blessings and good luck!",

            "Congratulations is in order. \n\nI know that this time in your life, everything seems really scary and for you it might be even more so because you haven't been exposed to the real world in a real way, but just know it will get easier. And it will happen faster than you might think. \n\nYou will be completely fine! Life is extremely complicated, but at the same time, really simple. \n\n-Take it one day at a time. \n\n-Keep people in your life that make you better and happy, and shut out people that don't, even if it's family. \n\n-Keep studying and reading as much as you can and keep learning as much as you can; you have a little catching up to do but not that much, you'll be caught up in no time! Being an adult isn't so hard \ud83d\ude42\n\n-Use the internet and YouTube and Google to figure out logistics of specific things you're trying to figure out if you're unsure what to do in a certain situation.\n\n-I'm sure you already know this as you were able to use Reddit to get advice. \n\n-Build a good support system (teachers, friends, counselors etc...). It might take some time but it's essential. \n\nBottom line: you ARE an adult and you were dealt a bad hand but you gotta play it. It's up to you now on where you'll go with your life and the possibilities are endless. Consider yourself lucky and grateful for the things you DO have that some do not, and understand and acknowledge the things you don't have that others might. \n\nYou are now just another human being trying to find their way.

I just wanted to add something- please continue on with the psychologist or some form of counseling and work on building up your self esteem and confidence. (It will take time but it's so worth it!) Unfortunately for those of us that have been abused, we sometimes fall back into the same pattern and start new relationships with abusive people (friendships or romantic). The key is to learn that you are worthy of respect so that you don't ever let anyone treat you like your family did again. Good luck, you are very inspiring!",

Yeah, it's hard living on your own, but definitely doable.\n\nSo look at it as an adventure, rather than a fight.  Try to reduce that anxiety.  Maybe continue to see that psychologist a few more times, perhaps they can help you deal with this anxiety.\n\n20+ years old, that's when most people move away from their families and start living on their own, and working on creating their own families.

        "selftext": "A week ago my husband Rory and I returned home from a two week vacation. We had hired a house sitter (Clara) to come over every day and feed our cats, check the mail, and also water my plants every three days. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen we entered our house I instinctively turned to drop my keys into the key bowl and they hit the ground. We turned on our lights and our foyer had been completely rearranged. Our first thought was we had been robbed and we began to move through the house checking every room to make sure we were home alone, ready to dial 911. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat we discovered was just bizarre. All of our furniture had been rearranged, our living room, dining room, tv and stereo system, office, bedroom, my craft room, the den, my husband's game room. Even my piano has been moved!!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBack in the kitchen we were looking around and I noticed that my pantry door was open. When I went to close it I realized my entire walk in pantry had been completely rearranged floor to ceiling. I started opening cabinets and all my baking supplies, pots and pans, cutlery, and even my silverware and junk drawers have been moved.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs I was frantically looking through the bedroom and office making sure nothing had been stolen and our safe was intact, Rory found a note from Clara. In it she stated that she'd enjoyed house sitting for us and she hoped that we liked our new living space. That she has been taking a course in interior design and she decided to \"allow us to become her first client, pro bono\" (her words!). She placed pieces from other rooms in different rooms so it wasn't as easy as just switching each room back to how it was. She took down pictures and artwork, *patched the holes in the walls*, and hung my artwork in different rooms!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReddit.....we do NOT like our new living space. What she did completely messed up the flow of our home. Rory and I spent over six months rearranging furniture and trying pieces in different rooms until we found exactly what we liked best. It was our first home together and it was important that we design it together as well. It really made us feel like our home was truly ours. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI really did not know what to say to her so I haven't talked to her yet. Clara is my friend and so Rory is leaving it up to me to deal with this. We spent three days putting our home back together again and I don't know how to deal with this. She has emailed me and asked what I think about the house and asked if I'd write a review for her new interior design business!! The level of entitlement was just mind boggling and then for her to expect a pat on the back and a review as well?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI do not know how to address this with her because honestly I'm afraid that if I don't have a script in mind, I will just begin screaming at her. I feel incredibly violated, almost as if someone had broken into the house. Both Rory and I are OCD, and I have GAD. I'm having difficulty sleeping at night and I am so uncomfortable in the house ever since we got home. How do I explain that this was unappreciated and highly violating? Should I even mention that it was a really, really shitty design job? \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nShe is a SAHM and she is often bored and then \"opens a business\" and six months later drops it and never does it again. She's been a photographer, a caterer, a cake decorator, and now I guess an interior designer. Always unlicensed and she always leaves someone in a lurch. She was supposed to cater a wedding. She got bored, quit doing it, and didn't tell the bride until a month before the wedding. Same with doing baby photo shoots and a few people's cakes for birthdays or baby showers. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nShe seems to enjoy the thrill of new business cards, buying all the equipment, making a Facebook business page, and then once she starts getting jobs (because unfortunately she's one of those people that are great at everything they pick up) she gets bored and quits. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease tell me what to say and how to address this!!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR After going on vacation for two weeks, my husband and I returned home only to find all of our furniture moved around. How do we address this?**\n\n\n\n\n**UPDATE**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFirst of all thank you to everyone who replied. I've read every single comment on the thread, the good, the bad, and the ugly. Thanks to everyone that decided to private message me and tell me I was crazy and a whining *insert curse word here*. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nA little clarification, Clara does know about our medical issues. The first few times I went to knitting group I had mild panic attacks and it was quite obvious I had issues with my yarn tension due to my anxiety. Our entire knitting group really rallied around me and appointed themselves my surrogate \"grandmas and sisters\". This is one of the big reasons that I didn't think twice about having her housesit, as she knew about them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI showed Rory the thread and he agreed with me that we did need to address it soon so I wrote an email to Clara based on the comments of /u/tingiling and /u/illinoiscentralst.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Dear Clara,\n\n\n>I'm so very hurt and angry about what you have done. We let you into our home because we trusted you. We trusted you to respect how we put our hearts into making it our home. We trusted you to respect how important it is to us to have our own space where we can feel safe and comfortable. Mainly, we trusted you to respect our home and what it meant to us in the short time you would spend in it alone.\n\n\n>When we came home, we thought we had been robbed and panicked! When we realised that nothing was stolen, but that our entire home had been rearranged to fit someone else's idea of a house without our permission or knowledge, we didn't feel much better. You are aware of mine and Rory's medical conditions and what it means to us to have a safe space.\n\n\n>I'm hurt by your actions. But, I also think people can make mistakes. I was wondering if we can meet up for a quick coffee/lunch to discuss what has happened here when you housesat for us. \n\n\n>Amy\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe're set to meet up for coffee on Tuesday afternoon at the local coffee shop. All she replied back with was \"I'm so sorry and I would like to explain.\" I have what I want to say charted it out and I've practiced it with Rory until I'm blue in the face. I'm not sure what she could explain to me but I'm interested to hear what it could be. I called a few women from the knitting group and I asked them if they'd heard that Clara had done anything to my house. They had not. I asked them to tea on Thursday to speak with them. So that is also set up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf anyone has any new questions I'll try to answer them here. Thanks for all your advice, I'll try to update when I have something new.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR I have meetings set up with Clara and my knitting group. I have what I'm going to say planned out already.**",

I will not leave a rewiev for you, and you should consider that a favour. \n\nYou have disrespected my house, me and my husband. I get that you thought we would approciate this, but I don't understand how you didn't realise that this wasn't a good idea. You crossed so many boundaries and violated the trust I gave you.\n\nI'm hurt by your actions. I also think people can make mistakes.\n\nI would like to try move past this, and chalk this up to one case of extremly bad judgement. However, I would like an apology and some reassurance that in the future you will not do anything to me, my husband or our house without our permission, no matter what your reason might be.\"",
            "Man, I'd be especially pissed about the piano. It might have to be retuned now after moving it twice! (Depending on how strenuous the move was on it, and if the flooring/humidity/temperature was vastly different in the room she put it in.)",
            "If anyone EVER were to mess with my craft room, heads would roll! Let alone the entire house? I'm speechless, OP. I would be honest and tell her what you've told us, that you were uncomfortable in your home, that this was unexpected and alarming considering you had no heads-up before you returned and on top of the fact you have OCD (I know how that feels) you had to spend time getting things back to the way they were.  She probably honestly thought she was doing you a favor, but it doesn't make it any less invasive.",
            "There is a chance that something big happened and this was an attempt to cover it up and hope it went unnoticed. I would find some way of officially documenting that she thoroughly messed with your house while you were gone (maybe consult with a lawyer - I'm not sure how that works) so that it is on record if somewhere down the road you find something damaged, ruined or missing. \n\n\nI would also take some security measures like canceling and reordering any checks that were in the house. This could also have been an excuse for a very in depth snooping. I might be overly suspicious, but your identities could be at risk.",
            "Sounds like she used you to get a positive revew for her \"new business.\"  I would do what others recommend and let her know how furious you are that she disrespected you and your space.  That being said, she sounds tone-deaf enough to interpret this as you lashing out for doing you a favor, so she may end the friendship... at least until she returns to her flibbertigibbet ways and tries to inconvenience you with her latest ~~business~~ hobby.",
            "I know you're worried about rocking the boat with your friend group, but as one adult with a friend group to another, if you told me this story about a mutual friend my jaw would drop. It's a socially bizarre thing to go in someone's house and move everything unasked and the icing on the bizarre cake to then treat it as some gift. You need to do right by you and your husband and knock this woman down a few pegs.\n\nAlso, if she was at all invested in your friendship (or even a decent person to begin with) she would apologize. That's the minimum she should do. If she does anything else (offended, gossips, etc.) She is wrong. Not you.\n\nTell her... \"hey clara, we really did not appreciate your moving all of our possessions.  It was uncalled for and invasive. We would have appreciated it if you had asked to lend us your services and we could have discussed a project. We will not be leaving you a review. Additionally, if you took any pictures of our house you need to destroy them. You do not have our permission to use them, nor may you reference us a client. We trusted you with our home and you broke that trust.\"\n\nI know it's uncomfortable but dig deep and just remember she manhandled your piano and probably looked in your underwear drawer. Get mad. Text it. See what she says. It should be \"sorry\", probably won't be, but you're not in the wrong ",
            "Reply by email. Tell her that you and your husband are both very distressed about it and that she was completely wrong to do this without your consent. End the friendship.\n\n",
            "\"Clara, the most important aspect of any client-centered career is the client. Your intentions weren't bad, but this is our home and it is extremely important to us that we have input in what happens in our home. We wish you had asked us. We did not want our home to be redesigned. Aesthetics are not as important to us as this feeling like our home, and a big part of that was setting things up ourselves. \n\n\n~~We would like you to restore our home to the arrangement it was in previously~~.\" (Using \"home\" so many times is intentional)\n\n\n~~If she refuses, then take it to legal advice - make sure you keep her note and any other documentation about this being a job to her.~~\n\n\nPersonally, I'd give her the benefit of the doubt ...once. She likely thought she was doing you a favor with the added bonus of good reviews for getting into interior design. Hopefully she understands, doesn't take it personally, and learns that not all surprises are welcome.\n\n\nEdit: I missed that it was already put back in order. Also, this was horribly misguided, but the care and effort she put in shows she meant well. Certainly the trust OP had to allow her free reign of their house is gone, but that doesn't necessarily mean the friendship has to be nuked.\n\n",
            "Dear Clara,\n\nI do not understand why you abused our trust in this way. I really thought we were friends and that you understood that my husband and I have personal boundaries that includes not having our furniture and household items disturbed.\n\nBy not consulting us regarding your plans to redecorate, you have caused us severe stress and disrespected our self expression. It is unlikely that my husband and I will ever be able to truly feel comfortable in our home and relaxed on a vacation.\n\nGiven that you are studying interior design, I'm surprised that you did not consider *our* feelings on the design of *our* home at all.\n\nPlease be advised that Rory and I do NOT give permission for you to use any images of our property and will be seeking legal advice if we discover their use from both you and the educational institution you are studying at.\n\nIf you would like us to post a review on your behalf, we will, but it will not be favourable to you.\n\nSincerely, OP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "She almost certainly had help. A sole person, especially a 35 year old woman, cannot rearrange everything by herself. **Other people have been inside your home** without your consent, pawed all your belongings. I would not be surprised if you have a few items stolen. It's time to take a good look at everything OP. ",

            "Wow. OP, I am incredibly angry on your behalf. I am so sorry that you are dealing with this invasion of privacy. \n\nMy SIL did something similar to us. She stayed at our place for a weekend and took it upon herself to buy $250 of crap to hang on the walls (and then expected us to reimburse her). We were furious. My SO *hates* stuff on the walls, so all our walls were completely bare. I know it sounds crazy and weird to most people, but it's how we wanted to decorate our place (or not decorate, actually) and it wasn't a \"problem\" for me. \n\nMy SO ended up piling everything in the car and dumping it on her front porch telling her to never try that shit again. She was butt-hurt for awhile but eventually got over it. \n\nI think in your case, you need to have a stern sit down with this woman. I think the most glaring problem is that she decided her \"need\" to be an interior decorator was greater than the need for you to actually approve of her doing the work. If she can't see how selfish and disrespectful her actions were, then there is no point in trying to continue a relationship with her of any kind. ",
            "If you don't feel like you're going to be able to keep calm when talking to her on the phone, you could send a text or an email instead. It would be much better if you did phone her, but if you don't want to risk ending up screaming at her then the alternative might be better. What might help you if you call can also be writing clear bullet points (or full sentences) of what you want to convey. Rehearse with your husband if you have to, so that the sentences are not unfamiliar to you when you talk to her.\n\nI would not soften what you'll tell her with a \"I know you meant well, but...\" either. Keep it short, and make sure you are not waffling about with your wording. \"Friend, rearranging our entire house without asking was highly inappropriate behavior, and I am extremely upset with you for having overstepped to such a degree.\" \n\nIf she tries to argue against you that it was a *favor* and you should be happy, let her know that this was not a favor for you but *for herself.* \n\nYou don't have to overexplain things either, and if you feel like the conversation is taking a turn for the worse, then you can always shut it down with a \"I am too upset to discuss this with you right now, so we'll take this up later\" and hang up. \n\nI'd be prepared for her bombarding you with \"but omg it was a favor\" and \"I'd thought you'd be happy\" and other such things, though. \n\n",
            "I'm sorry to possibly make you more uncomfortable/paranoid, but do you have all your valuables and sensitive information secured in a lockbox or something? Have you checked on them? I'm wondering if she had other people come in and help move stuff around and patch things up, because it doesn't sound like something she can do all by herself. And you wouldn't know who these people are or if they were trustworthy enough to not go through your things. \n\nEdit: Oh, totally missed that you said that you did. But still, I'd want to ask if she had other people in your home to help move things. And I'd inform her that what she did was wrong. Even if she was trying to be nice, what she did was totally disrespectful. One should never rearrange anything in someone's home/sanctuary without permission.",
            "The primary thing you tell her is that an interior designer makes recommendations while working with the client - they do not make unilateral decisions without the client's knowledge or consent.

I'll give you two options for wording depending on whether or not you want to continue this friendship:\n\n1. Hi Cindy, \nthanks again for house sitting for us, it gave us peace of mind to know our things were looked after while we were away. That said, I'm uncomfortable with you rearranging our furniture and decor without consulting us. I wish you had called before you went ahead, as I would have told you that we worked hard to get our house to a comfortable arrangement and we were happy with it. As a result, I think it would be inappropriate for us to give you a review, as we weren't consulted on the design nor were we paying clients. I hope you understand. In the future, please ask before going above and beyond the call of duty. Best, housesitterisapsycho \n\n2. Cindy, \nNo, we will not be leaving you a review of any kind. We were not consulted on the \"redecorating\" and feel extremely violated. We thought someone had robbed us when we got home and spent an hour combing through the house making sure nothing was stolen. You crossed such a major boundary, and frankly, I would be angry even if I *didn't* hate the results (I do). We loved our home the way it was. I don't owe you a review; YOU owe US an apology. Needless to say, we'll be calling someone else to watch our house in the future. Kindly stay off our property. \nHousesitterisapsycho \nP.S. You're terrible at this. There's my review. ",
            "I've seen a few people think you're being extreme because you're considering ending the friendship over this, and I would like to offer a counter point to that.\n\nSHE ended the friendship by taking advantage of it. I highly doubt she would have done this if you weren't already friendly and if you were just a neighbour that hired her. This is a violation of privacy and she took full advantage of your friendship.\n\nI hope you start to feel comfortable in your own home, as someone with OCD it must be very difficult for you. It's supposed to be where you feel safe.",
            "Your friend is insane. There is some good advice here. Let her know you didn't appreciate her actions \n\nBut seriously... She moved all your furniture including a PIANO. That is dedication. I needed two 6'3\" men to move my piano and even they struggled. I can't believe she did all this without even asking. Who does that??? ",
            "Through email, be honest.  If your friendship is solid she will understand and maybe apologize.  Start it with somwthing like \"when we got home I thought we were robbed. we felt very vulnerable, violated, and upset as we went through the rooms not knowing what was happening, then we found your note.  This was not a welcomed surprise, your intentions may have been good but unfortunately they left us feeling violated in our own home and continue to feel uneasy as we reset our house.  Permission and consent is something you needed to ask before taking a project like this on.  I will not be giving you a review or referral.  You are not allowed to use any photos before or after of our home for your business.\"   \n\nOdds are she took photos so she can show perspective clients.  I say email her, because you can be in more control of what you say and how your phrase it without losing control by yelling at her.  Because she sounds like a person you raise your voice to she will instantly disregard what you have to say.  Good Luck.",
            "Call her. \"Hi Clara, I was wondering if we can meet up for a quick coffee/lunch to discuss what has happened here when you housesat for us.\" Whatever she replies, don't let her get too much into it, cut the call short: \"Let's put a pin in all that until we meet up in person. Can we make it [Date Time Place]?\" Stay serious, calm and neutral.\n\nOnce you meet with her, remain serious calm and neutral. \"Clara let me get straight to the point. You have made significant changes to our house which we don't appreciate. My husband and I have health issues that need accommodation, and we have spent 6 months after moving in figuring out the placement of everything. The fact that you've made such big changes to our living space when we trusted you with taking care of our house on our terms was a shock. Surprises aren't always a good thing, and this was one of the times when you most definitely should have called us and asked for permission. \n\nWe have had to spend a significant amount of time and effort putting everything back as it was before. I cannot comment on the quality of your services, I can only say they were 100% unasked for and unwarranted. If you took any pictures of our house, please, delete them. \n\nWe're not interested in escalating this, we just want to make everything right again. [Insert any other demands you have here] Please let me know if you have anything else you'd like to add, but from now on, let me say that after this invasion of our privacy, we both feel quite apprehensive. I hope we can re-set the boundaries where they should be.\"\n\nIf you have trouble remaining serious and calm, prepare this conversation beforehand, rehearse with someone if necessary, but the thing is, people like Clara don't just sit back and let you talk. She'll probably be all over the place explaining herself, or going on the offensive, or talking about this or that. You can listen to her, but don't react, don't get distracted yourself, and stick to your point. Good phrases: \"This is not really the issue we're discussing. Let's get back to that after we discuss this.\" \"Be that as it may, the point remains ...\" \"Let's get back to the issue at hand.\" If she says a bunch of stuff that barely makes any sense on its own: \" ... Right. As I was saying, we'd like...\"\n\nThe point here is, Clara just might well be the kind of a person who won't wage a personal war against you two. She sounds a bit childish and she might respond well to the same treatment you'd extend to your kid if they did something extraordinarily stupid: you'd be firm, you'd make clear what needs to be done to set things right, but you would ultimately still leave the conversation knowing that you're both remaining in each other's lives.\n\nNote that this approach would only work if Clara is ultimately seeking love/approval from you and Rory. If she circles back and goes for the jugular, you feel free to cut her off so fast her head will spin. But I'm also wondering - how exactly did Clara move everything, especially your piano? I have a piano and if I moved it on my own, I'd definitely damage the floor somewhat. Check your floors and furnishing for damage, take pictures of it, and what do you know, you might even be able to threaten legal discourse if she's up in your face too much.",
            "Write her a letter and tell her what you told us here. Make the tone of the letter calm, but be honest. Let her know that you feel violated, that her actions were invasive and entitled, and that you spent a lot of time and effort putting everything right back where it was. ",

My uncle stayed with us when I was 35 weeks pregnant. He would cook and I didn't realize he was rearranging things so it made sense to him.

Anyways, I walk out into the parking lot and he's got a bucket of white indoor paint and he's painting the lines and numbers back onto people's parking spaces. He's not following the original pattern either. He drew lines under some peoples space numbers and not under others. The cars that were parked in their space covering the numbers he just extended the number behind the car if that makes sense. It was him, a cigarette in one hand a paintbrush in the other, sloppily going away at these parking spots. When he got 3/4 way through the parking lot he decided he'd had enough and quit.

If it was me, I would approach it from the perspective that she may have meant well, but the previous configuration was meaningful to you and your partner and you will be doing the work to put the configuration back. It might be contentious, but I would expect an apology related to the cost of your time and resources.\n\nIf you don't want to stay friends, you could just be honest and tell her how incredibly intrusive and professionally inappropriate her behavior was. Might be worth doing that anyways, if you think she can handle it. \n\n",

        "selftext": "I've been with my fiance for 3 years, 8 months engaged. We've had our ups and downs, but for the most part things have been pretty great, until she moved in 6 months ago. We've been combining our lifestyles and finances, basically easing into merging our lives together.\n\nThe problem is she's a \"people pleaser\", in her own words. She's been in therapy for 6 years, and I guess I never knew how bad it was until moving in with her, a lot of which she's hidden from me. I don't want this to get too long, so here's some of the highlights in no particular order:\n\n* She recently was promoted into accounts payable at her company and realized she is the lowest paid person on payroll. She didn't negotiate a good starting wage, and has never asked for a raise, or had one, despite multiple promotions.\n\n* She inherited a car a few months ago and sold it. She had offers online from $18k-$25k, but sold it to the first person who showed up for $10k.\n\n* She caught someone stealing her bike at college. The woman stealing the bike managed to convince my fiance that it was actually her bike and my fiance just let her take it, despite the fact that she caught the woman cutting her bike lock.\n\n* Last spring was my 30th birthday and she ordered a giant chocolate cake for the party. The cake normally comes with nuts, but given my allergy for nuts she ordered it without them. Well when she went to pick it up and it had nuts on it, she just paid for it and brought it home. I couldn't even be in the same room as the cake.\n\nWhich brings us to tomorrow. My father recently passed away and I need to fly to the other end of the country to get things sorted out with family, attend the funeral, etc.. Meanwhile, we recently had a pipe burst in our home, and the contractors will be out tomorrow to fix it. My flight's at 6am and my fiance will have to handle it, including all the negotiations because we don't know the extent of the damages.\n\nI've been giving it a lot of thought and I just don't trust my fiance to handle it. And if I can't trust or rely on her to do something like this, how can we really be life partners? I mean I trust that she is always looking out for me, and has my best interest at heart, but I can't trust her to get things done.\n\nWe've talked about it a few times before, but it's been unproductive. She's convinced she's just being nice and doesn't like confrontation, then brings up examples of extremely confrontational people. I think she puts her aversion to conflict above her/our long term goals, and she needs to find a happy medium. She doesn't understand how negatively this is impacting her life.\n\nBut at the same time, we've had some amazing years together and she really is a great person. We're compatible in almost every other way. So is this over like I think it is? Is there any way I can get through to her? Should I tell her I'm thinking about leaving?\n\ntl;dr: Fiance is a self-described \"people pleaser\", it's caused her to make a lot of terrible mistakes and I'm thinking about leaving her.",

            "> I've been giving it a lot of thought and I just don't trust my fiance to handle it. **And if I can't trust or rely on her to do something like this, how can we really be life partners?** I mean I trust that she is always looking out for me, and has my best interest at heart, but I can't trust her to get things done.\n\nYeah...this is exactly why I left my last relationship. My situation was by no means as serious as yours (you couldn't even be in the same room as *your* birthday cake because your fiance was too nice/gutless to say \"You made a mistake, this is not the cake I ordered\"? That's not being a people-pleaser, that's being terrified of people), but it was enough for me to leave. \n\nMy partner loved me with every atom of his mind, body and soul, and I loved him back. He told me that had I been disabled in a horrendous accident and/or been reduced into a vegetative state, he would have stood by me and cared for me. It's a very nice thing to say and I'm sure he believed he meant it, but the sentiment lacked subsistence when I couldn't even rely on him to take out the rubbish, even if I reminded him when I left the house and then sent him reminders on text and facebook messenger. \n\nWe almost missed out on tickets to an incredibly exclusive event that I had been desperate to go to because he didn't check his inbox for a few weeks. I once asked him to pick up an item whilst he was at the shops; he didn't because he didn't think we needed it, then called me an hour later to pick said item up on my way home from work because he realised we do need it after all. I would ask him to do a task whilst I was out at work (ie, wash dishes, pay a bill, make a phonecall), and would come home to find it undone because he \"ran out of time\", even though he worked half the hours I did and was home every morning.\n\nI felt like I was the only adult in the relationship. I was forever picking up the pieces of his problems and comforting him over life's little bumps, but I couldn't rely on him to shoulder my burdens, even when it was something as simple as taking responsibility for household tasks. Eventually, I had to leave. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done, because I loved him dearly and I still do. But after so many years together, I loved him more like a clumsy child in my care than a partner I could rely on and build a life with. \n\nI think the only way you might be able to get through to your partner is if you tell her how seriously this problem is affecting you. But as another redditor said, if she's been in therapy for 6 years, it's highly unlikely she'll make any progress in the next few months, if she makes any progress at all. It was certainly what happened in my case. I begged my partner to seek therapy for his depression and/or anxiety, and told him it was a serious enough problem to be affecting our relationship. He got as far as asking his GP for a referral...and that was it. Life went on as usual. I don't think it was from a lack of caring. I think he just honestly didn't comprehend *how* much his issues impacted my life and the relationship as a whole. \n\nYou know leaving this relationship will hurt your fiance, possibly even devastate her, but you also know it to be the right thing to do. You deserve a life and relationship where you don't have to carry the weight of two people. Where you don't have to come home and listen to the new story of what went wrong today because she was too scared to speak up. Where you can ask your partner to do something and *know* they will do it. I recently moved in with a new partner and I cannot tell you what a relief it is to no longer feel like I'm steering a ship alone.  You deserve to feel that relief and peace. \n\nYes, you should leave. ",
            "this might be an off-the-wall suggestion, but maybe a martial arts or self-defense class? learning to assert and protect herself might help.",
            "If you ever talk to her about this - ask her, who is she trying to please?\n\nI understand that she's trying to go with the road of least resistance and she's not willing to choose her own comfort. But as in the example with your birthday cake - who was more important to her in that situation? The cake shop worked, or her SO? If you were more important then she should have asked for a refund/different cake/a way to fix the problem. \n\nThis is a tough call... I would probably have her defer the contractors to you tomorrow. I.e. Have them call you to discuss damage and payment. \n\nThen I would sit down with her after you're home and discuss your concerns with her. Point out that you're worried that her priorities aren't in order and that you have a hard time considering trusting her to deal with bigger issues that can cost a lot of money and cause further problems down the line. \n\nTell her how serious the situation looks from your point of view and how you are having serious doubts about your mutual future. \n\nIf she values the relationship, she will consider seeing a new therapist and trying to find ways to work through her people-pleasing. If she doesn't value the relationship (and/or if working on the relationship is too confrontational for her) then she isn't someone who deserves being married to you. ",
            "This is not being a \"people-pleaser\". The lack of a raise is being spineless and lacking in confidence. The car thing is having an incredible lack of judgment and poor financial sense. The bike thing is being naive, gullible and easily manipulated. The cake thing is again spineless and extremely inconsiderate of your safety, something she needs to take much more seriously if she wants a life with you.\n\n\nMaybe these are things you can get past, but I think most people couldn't put up with all of this. These are bad traits to have in a partner and worse yet, she won't take responsibility for her actions and just blames it on being a \"people-pleaser\" which is really just her refusing to be a responsible person and act like an adult. Unless she can somehow suddenly become more confident and assertive I'd do some serious thinking. If she is unable to change, consider whether you can put up with this behavior for the rest of your life. ",
            "I would definitely at least postpone the wedding. I hate when people use being a \"people pleaser\" as an excuse because if that was true they wouldn't disregard their partner's feelings when they express that there is a problem. If telling her that the wedding is on hold doesn't cause her to make any changes then you have to decide if this is something you want to put up with in the long term. Also, stop hiding the negative effects from her. Tell her \"I'm already stressed with making the trip for my father's funeral and the fact that I can't trust you to handle the contractors is not helping\". I have some anxiety issues and my husband handles a lot of stuff like that, but he only does that because he knows that while I prefer not to do that sort of thing if there was a situation where I had to I would have no problem doing it and he wouldn't need to worry about it not being done properly. ",
            "First, I'm really sorry for the loss of your father. \n\nI think the situation with the contractor is a good jumping point for a new conversation. I would sit her down and tell her that you know she loves you and wants the best for you, but you need a partner you can rely on to handle difficult situations when you're not able to be there.\n\nShe needs to know how seriously this problem is impacting not only *her* life, but the life you want to build together. I do think this is a problem that is fixable if she's willing to really work on it with someone qualified to help her. I wonder if the therapist she's seeing isn't the right fit for her if there's been no meaningful improvement in six years.\n\nIn your shoes, I would suggest looking into a new therapist who can work with her individually and with both of you as a couple. Be honest and let her know that her passivity is something you can't live with, and unless she's willing to make progress, you're looking at the end of your relationship.",
            "This is a tough one, but will your insurance not cover the water damage and burst pipe?  They should be the ones to do negotiations and send contractors, and usually a few days of dehumidifiers and fans need to be put up before any repairs are done when it involves water damage.  Hopefully you can get back before they do repairs. Or you ask them to hold off and only do the restoration work (fans and dehumidifiers) until you return. \n\nTell her she is not to deal with them, and if a close friend or her family member is nearby, ask for them to assist.\n\nThen find her a new counselor and have a VERY SERIOUS talk with her. She's not a people pleaser, she's pretty much incapacitated by fear of making any decision/standing up for herself, she disrespects herself AND you and is okay with endangering your life (the cake).

She's so averse to saying \"excuse me, but...\" that she's willing to put the life of a loved you (yourself and the cake) in danger. No one ENJOYS confrontation. But you have to learn how to handle it. Especially if you're going to be in any kind of long term relationship and even more so if you have kids. \n\nShe needs a new therapist if this one is telling her that this is \"people pleasing.\" It may be that she's hiding her behavior from the therapist as well though. At any rate, I'd not start making serious wedding plans until she learns to stand up for herself. And for you. (A woman who won't say to a baker (that she doesn't know and will probably never see again) \"I'm sorry, but my fiance is allergic to nuts and I ordered this without\" but will instead bring it home to said allergic fiance (who she DOES know and presumably love) is NOT looking out for you.

The whole conflict avoidance is at such a gross level, I'd really worry if I were you. \n\n*She literally gave a thief her bike and put your safety in jeopardy because she couldn't stand the thought of standing up for herself.*\n\nMaybe she felt her opinions weren't worth mentioning, or she's \"always wrong\" or the fear and anxiety are so great that a little monetary loss or dead boyfriend is a smaller price to pay.\n\nI don't buy it for one second that she thought the bike belonged to the thief--my guess is she was afraid to stand up to the thief, didn't want to cause a scene and the associated stressors would be too high a mental cost compared to the cost of a new bike. It almost sounds like some sort of learned helplessness. Is she seeing anyone professionally about this? \n\nThe other problem is that she won't stand up for herself, which means all this falls on you to enable her (under the guise of \"support\") You'll wind up being a parent to her. \n\nIf you hadn't told me about the nut allergy thing, I would have suggested her taking assertiveness training classes (power of no?) and things like that. Given that she risks your health, on your birthday, means that she's placing a higher value on conflict avoidance than you. Ouch. Get her to a counselor.\n\nOne question, does she ever fight with you? I wonder if she bottles up all her anger and only allows herself to vent / be mad at you, because she knows she can.\n ",

            "Its never a good idea to marry until you, (or your partner in this case) has firm established personal boundaries and is able to communicate in a healthy way about them in order to enforce them with others, and  you. \n\nIts actually a pretty common cause of marital issue when the partner is more comfortable pleasing someone outside the union than dissapointing the partner. Your cake story is an extreme example of this, where your fiance would rather let you down, than have a confrontation about the cake at the store.\n\nI certainly recommend that you hold off on marrying this person until you feel you can trust her to atleast secure that she doesnt violate your boundaries. If she is unable to hold her own, its probably not realistic to expect that she can reach that point though.\n\n*I would never have married my husband if he was unaccountable in this way. It would have meant he couldnt have my back, or be loyal, if ever an uncomfortable boundary of confrontation was in the way - So, dont feel bad if you want to leave like you say. Its natural even instinctual to lose attraction to someone demonstrating that behaviour*\n\nYou say she has been getting therapy. If you still love her, put the wedding on hold, and get her to seek therapy and couples councelling. Particularly the latter. She needs to know that refusing to acknowledge that she isnt just being nice, when these things are happening, is slowly driving you away and killing the relationship. You should make that pretty clear. - If you dont love her anymore, say your peace, or write it all down in a letter so she can get a full idea of why she is losing a partner. That would be a good and kind thing to do for her, if you do end up leaving.\n\nI have countless of examples of my husband or myself protecting one anothers boundaries, sticking up for one another or assisting in situations where one or the other is uncomfortable. You wont have that. And its essential to partnerships and building report and intimacy. You need to be able to trust in your unit.\n\n",

She's going to need to decide for herself what she prefers in terms of preventing this from seriously hurting you, but there's only so many options. Basically, she either needs to learn to stand up for herself (consider outright ordering her to do this; she can't stand not to do as she's told, right? tell her to grow a spine), she needs to abdicate all potential control over anything she can't handle (no access to money or property, basically, which maybe she'd prefer? obviously don't do this without asking), or you need to break up.

I know you can't eat it, but it's the thought that counts, right?\"\n\nSeems to me a true people pleaser would have bought the nutty cake and donated it to a homeless shelter, and then picked up a non-nutty cake on the way home.  But instead, she chose to care more about the feelings of the stranger behind the counter than *your* feelings--which should be her top priority.  \n\nSo it doesn't sound like people pleasing is her only problem.  She's also a poor problem-solver.  I once went through a phase of being terrified of confrontation, but it didn't affect my reasoning ability.

            "I think couples counseling is very important in this case, also because if she's so much of a \"people-pleaser\" I imagine there are a lot of things about the relationship/your girlfriend that you think are true that might not be.\n\nIf she's too adverse to confrontation to refuse a cake with nuts on it, how can you trust - for example, since I don't know where you stand on these issues - that she's really childfree, and not secretly harboring a desire for a kid but saying she's childfree to not rock the boat?  For that matter, how do you really know you both enjoy the same tv shows, or that she really does like Chinese food, or anything about her?  You may seem to be compatible in every way but she may just go along with whatever you say just because she doesn't want to disagree and wants you to like her.\n\nI would also be concerned about sharing finances with her.  I mean 3 of the examples on your list already show financial loss (salary, stolen bike, car).  How far does this go?  \n\nIs she going to loan thousands of dollars to a friend because she can't say no when they ask? Fall victim to a scam because she just wants to do what the nice Nigerian man in the email says?  Buy anything that telemarketers and door to door salesmen or people at kiosks in the middle of the mall sell?  Pay MSRP plus markups for her next car?  Not cancel gym memberships or magazine subscriptions or switch to cheaper cable or cellphone service because she can't handle the guilt-trip the retention department dishes out when you call?  Not switch jobs to progress her career because her boss might be upset that's she's leaving?  \n\nAnd, she's already shown that she's not only willing to do this stuff when it's all about her, but also when it affects you, too (the cake).  Are you okay with your money being used this way?  Are you okay marrying someone you can't trust to handle finances in a reasonably responsible manner?  \n\nI'm a people pleaser in a lot of ways, and pretty naturally submissive.  \n\nWhen we go out to eat I always agree to go wherever my boyfriend wants to go (unless it's Little Caesar's; pizza from a drive through is not okay).  I let myself be taken advantage of at work for too long before I put my foot down (I worked 6 day weeks for months because they were short staffed, and instead of finding a permanent solution they just assumed I was okay doing it.)  I've been putting off canceling my gym membership because I don't want to deal with the hassle.  But damn, I do have breaking points in even those things.  And I've been working on learning to identify and enforce reasonable boundaries in those areas with my therapist so I don't get taken advantage of in the future.\n\nAnd when I need to assert myself (like when I moved into a new house and the mattress company attempted delivery on the wrong day so I wasn't home, and then told me it would be a week before they would reattempt delivery, and offered me a set of pillowcases as compensation.  Or when my apartment complex tried to charge me a $500 per deposit and instate a monthly pet rent halfway through my lease when they knew I had a dog when I moved in and I signed a lease with no pet fees.  or negotiating for a new car.  Or sending back bad food at a restaurant) I can do so and not back down.\n\nI can't imagine letting someone talk me into believing that it was okay for them to steal my bike.  Or accepting thousands of dollars less for my car.  That's just so far beyond the realm of normal behavior that that it's hard to fathom.  ",

Obviously, some of these things happened in places where you were not part of them, but why didn't you send fiancee back to the cake store to exchange the cake? Why would you agree to stay in a different room during your party? Think about it. You may also have some of these same characteristics, but not nearly to the same extreme. \n\nYes, your fiancee as presented here has a pathological need to avoid a hint of confrontation, and that is seriously concerning.

However - I do know (from my own years at therapy) that avoiding confrontation just feeds into the anxiety and makes everything worse. I was also able to tell when my behavior was a strain on other people... and since I value being the kind of person/friend/partner others can trust, I've had to work on this a lot for the type of things we're talking about.\n\nThis is not 'nice' behavior - and it's certainly not nice for OP, or 'pleasing' to him. If my boyfriend showed up on my birthday with a cake I couldn't eat (for me - this is also an issue, gluten intolerance) - because he couldn't talk to the bakery, something would be wrong. To me, this sounds like anxiety - and something she should be addressing in therapy.\n\nIf her issues are having a negative impact on your life, you need to make that very clear. There are definitely ways to address this stuff with therapy. If that's not happening, then she's practicing avoidance in therapy as well.",

My dad now takes care of basically everything that isnt tidying/decorating their house and my mom working because she cant be trusted with anything of value. For them, its sort of works because my dad only works PT/free-lance and my mom makes good money.

Decisions you've made (for yourself or for the both of you) that she didn't agree with. And she's said nothing.\n\nThat shit has a way of coming back to bite you in the end. If she can't handle her emotions and the prospect of confrontation like a mature adult then I'd say run the fuck away. \n\nHonestly though, almost guaranteed she can't or won't change. This is a critical component of her personality and not something she can just switch off. ",
            "I think your instincts are exactly right on this. Moving in with her made a lot of things clear that you didn't see before. It's not too late to back out of this. \n\nI could not marry someone like this, knowing that I couldn't trust them to handle the things that need handling, knowing that I couldn't trust them with out financial security because they'd roll over for every scammer that came along, knowing that they couldn't set boundaries with our kids, with our relatives, with their coworkers. \n\nNo doubt she will make all sorts of promises to change/improve if you try to break it off with her, and she might even mean them. But after 6 years of therapy and multiple talks/confrontations on this issue, I think it's fair to assume that nothing is ever going to change. As I said, I couldn't marry someone who I couldn't trust to advocate for themselves and for our partnership. ",

What may seem like \"she is great, she likes all of the things I like\" might come to a thundering halt some day, when she finally figures out how to assert herself and there's a laundry list of things about the relationship that she's been fine with on the outside, but has been bothering her on the inside?

If she says she just avoids conflict, call her out. Tell her that's not a way to live her life because sometimes things happen.

It goes beyond \"wanting to be nice\" - it's much less \"nice\" to bring a life-threatening allergen into someone's home than to politely correct a mis-filled order, which is both perfectly reasonable and pretty much expected in the course of a day working retail. So I strongly agree that she needs to address this problem before she's in a fit state to be a life partner for you (or anyone).\n\nThat said, I also think you've just suffered a huge loss, and this is the wrong time to make any big, impulsive life decisions. Don't do anything hasty.

She's too scared or feels to awkward to even make the slightest of waves. What ever the easiest route is for a conversation or \"confrontation\" you can bet she will take it because that's easier than actually negotiating. I doubt she even has the confidence to handle the most basic negotiations even if she did want to. It's a little alarming that she's been in therapy for 6 years and has seen zero improvement. But again, it's easier for her to keep moving along with the status quo as opposed to actually changing. This not something I would be ok with in a life partner... ",

She flew 3.000 km the day after, but I was upset that she smiled when she saw me. I didn't give her attention, but I was angry when she said it was difficult being there with my family.\n\nVery shortly after I told her how sorry I was that I hadn't been good and asked if she could accept it because it was from the shock of the death. She completely accepted and thought nothing of it. Today we are better than ever and I love her for coming so shortly after when he died.\n\nMy point is that maybe you're giving her a harder time than normal and thinking worse thoughts because something else in your life happened - namely that your father passed.\n\nIf I were you I would probably slow down your thoughts and accept that maybe you're not exactly yourself right now.",
            "You need to have a serious talk with her.  Her conflict avoidance ends up causing her more conflict.  If her current therapist hasn't been able to help her with this after six years, it's time for her to find a new therapist.  Don't marry jer until and unless she makes significant progress.  I can sympathize with her, because I'm a pleaser as well, but damn, she takes it to extremes. ",
            "Okay, she's got a really, really serious problem that has essentially presented itself as a potential dealbreaker. I mean, it's a great example of why it's a good idea to live together before marriage, and if it turns out that she's just unable to change at all, then you know what you have to do.\n\nBefore you jump to that, though, might I recommend some couple's therapy first? She's been in therapy a long time, but is this something she's actually been working on?  Have you talked seriously about it?  That might be the best place to start. \n\nYes, put off the wedding indefinitely until you figure out how to begin to remedy this.  It would take her developing a full understanding of how much this personality trait of her is harming both of you, but especially you, and how much it undermines your trust in her. All of these examples seem to go back to the issue of financial maturity and compatibility.  Not only do you feel burdened by the idea of having to fight all the fights unsupported, even fighting her fights for her, but you also feel at risk of financial instability or ruin if she caves often or big enough. \n\n",

She is so afraid of making people made, she brought poison for your birthday.  My kids have nut allergies, I'd have demanded a new cake or a refund.  No shoulder shrug and bringing that shit home.

I don't think you want to have and attempt to raise children with someone that can't handle the stress of confrontation. Raising kids isn't pretty sometimes. \n\nMaybe you need to hold off on the engagement and talk to her about some milestones she will need to make in therapy and with her fear of confrontation before you two will marry. Put a time limit on it so she knows these aren't open-ended expectations. Maybe she will make some leaps and bounds, or maybe she won't. But, it's of course up to you how you want to handle things.

Growing up, my mother was niave. She didn't take us to doctors based on some lady's opinion. She couldn't stand up for me when I was in danger. She was abusive without understanding she was abusive.\n\ndo not marry this person, she put your life in danger. She has a learning disability, most likely. My mother did and does.

They would stand outside their door, right next to our door, smoke, play music, laugh, shout, etc all hours of the night and day. I talked to them multiple times. BF wouldn't do shit.\n\nOne night, I wasn't feeling well. I get *blinding* tension headaches sometimes, and I had one. They aren't clinically migraines, but they may as well be. I went out and was none to polite to the neighbors. I said I was sick of this shit, no reasonable person parties in common areas til 3 AM, if they didn't stfu immediately I was calling the cops. I got a barrage of sexist, racist, and ageist insults, threats, and cat calls. \n\nI went in to call the cops.\n\nBF goes out for a cigarette, *apologizes to them and gives our neighbor a cigarette*!!!!\n\nI was floored. When I asked why he had done that, he said \"We need to live next to them\" like I was the asshole for wanting to sleep off my headache at 4 AM. I said right there it was counseling, immediately, or break up equally immediately.\n\nHe would panic and shut doen in the face of conflict to such a degree he stopped reasoning. Like if you were faved with a hungry lion, you would do anything to make it go away, that's how he was with conflict. \n\nThat's not a people pleaser, that's inconsiderate to the level that your fiances comfort trumps all else.

It's insane, but a deeply held belief that informs everything they do.  \n\nI've been with one for over ten years and I'll tell you 2 things: \n\n1. It will take years to pick apart the bullshit and get a glimpse of who they are; and\n\n2. Hiding themselves takes enormous effort.

How is it that the people who are paid to do these things come before your feelings,  your emotions and your monetary interests. You should be concentrating on your family right now,  not having to worry about this shit. So ask her straight,  can you trust her? Can you rely on her to do right by YOU (and by proxy herself) \n\n\n\nMake sure she knows that this isn't about her pleasing people,  it's about her not putting you and herself before others. If she wants to be with you,  she needs to prove you can trust her to do right by you and that the fact that you're concentrating more on this than your father's funeral has made you realise if you can't rely on her,  then you won't have a successful future together. \n\n\n\nIt goes deeper than her trying to make others happy,  it's about her not making you UNHAPPY.  \n\n\nAnd honestly,  six years? Fire her fucking therapist and get her a new one. I'm sure she will find it hard to do this since she won't want to 'hurt' the therapist,  but this is what they are paid for, and if they can't do what they are paid for correctly,  she shouldn't be paying them. It's not about hurting their feelings,  it's about doing what's best for herself and you and your relationship, and she needs to understand how serious you are that your relationship is in jeopardy. Tell her,  if you don't make the extent of your feelings known,  she doesn't know she needs to work harder to fix this if she wants a future with you. Lay it all out there. Let her know how damaging this is and that you simply won't last if you can't trust her to do right by herself let alone you. \n\n\n\nShe needs to know,  if she doesn't,  nothing will change. Forget the conversations you have had in the past and look at the now instead. Forget that you have tried before because my guess is you have done it in such a way to try and not hurt her feelings. But you NEED to hurt her feelings if you want to save your relationship,  because breaking up with her will hurt her a hell of a lot more.\n\n\n\n So here's your challenge - its showing her how someone CAN put themselves first,  even if it's going to hurt someone else - because if you don't,  the mess gets bigger,  the hurt gets stronger and the resentment becomes impossible to ignore. So use this conversation as a teaching method to show her sometimes it's better to hurt someone a little bit to try and prevent hurting them a lot. ",
            "I think confrontation is hard for a lot of people but it doesn't seem like she's actively working on it after 6 years in therapy. I'm not a fan of ultimatums but you sincerely sound like you're ready to throw the towel in if things don't change so I'd just be honest with her and say so. If she changes that's great and if not you can amicably split and find partners that are better suited for each of you.",

I mean, I get it, I am not the best negotiator and have let some things go that I shouldn't have, but after therapy (and certainly not 6 years!) I have learned how to deal with my issues.  \n\nTo me it sounds like she doesn't WANT to change and no amount of therapy will work if the person isn't open to it.",

If I do actually try to use it, and they say \"it looks like it was damaged slightly we can't exchange this \" I'll just meekly say okay and leave.\n\nI don't know what to tell you other than conflict is terrifying in the moment.

            "I know someone with this. IT is incredible painful to see her go through life. She can't even say no to things that would severely impact her commitments with her significant other and we have to really think over our requests/questions to her at the risk of ruining another aspect of her life. and that's from the perspective of her friends. In contrast she's had the most questionable and regrettable sexual history because other guys realize her inability to refuse and take advantage of her in horrible ways. \n\nDoesn't sound anywhere as severe as your fiancee but for my friend I feel it is a very sad and unfortunate mental affliction :( and I just hope you figure something out.",
            "This goes far beyond people pleasing.  She has so little confidence in herself that she can't even function as an adult.  You can't trust her to be your partner.  You should just break up with her.  If 6 years of therapy hasn't improved the problem, maybe nothing will.  This woman is just not capable of being your partner.",
            "That's not people pleasing, it sounds more like a mental disability. Are you sure she doesn't have some sort of developmental problem? I mean, how would you feel about her looking after your kids on her own?\n\nIt's ok to overlook some floors for the one you love (nobody's perfect) but will you actually be able to live a normal life with this woman? Or will you be some sort of carer?",

Have you ever had a fight? \n\nPoint out that you just want that same willingness to stand up for your shared interests as not doing so would cost you both money in the long run and her failure to do that is not fair on you. \n\nAlso say that attitude could affect your kids in the future, is she going to let a kidnapper take your child away because they convince her it's their kid? \n\nAlso, 6 years in therapy? Either she was a complete shambles 6 years ago and that therapist is a genius, or the therapist needs sacked. \n\nI think as other people have said get couples therapy. ",
            "OP, your fiancee is just like me. It's taken me years to learn to speak up when things go wrong and stand up to people. It is still a constant daily struggle. I have anxiety issues that stem from being yelled at for my entire life by my dad until I finally got kicked out the one time I stood up for myself. Since then it's been a series of uphill battles for me, and every time it seemed I tried to fix something or stand up for myself, I would get fired from a job or find myself without a place to live. These things can really make a person just not want to deal with anything, ever, because if we do we feel like we could lose everything. So we just tell ourselves to go with it, it'll work out eventually. Anything to avoid a potential disaster.\n\nThings are getting better for me and I have learned, am learning, to be more assertive. But it takes time. Just try to get her some help, she shouldn't have to go through this all on her own like I'm still having to.",

But I think your worries are 100% founded. ",
            "It does sound to me like you might be being too harsh on her....while the things you listed do sound like an issue, it sounds like it's more of a problem she has with her own self confidence and standing up to people. If you trust her with everything else, and really believe she loves you can has your best interest in mind, do you really want to leave a loyal, loving person over something like that? I think that before leaving her, you need to sit down with her and tell her that this is really a problem for you, and it's affecting your thoughts on a future with her. If she's been in therapy, then she has somebody who can help her with this issue, and if not, I'd suggest she finds a new therapist. Tell her you want to work through it with her and that you want to be with her if she's willing to make these changes. Just be totally honest. See what happens. I'd give her a chance though, I mean, she is your fianc\u00e9, not just a girlfriend. ",

            "Your wife's problem is her inability to be assertive. Links aren't allowed, but there's a great book called \"When I say no, I feel guilty\". It helps, a lot, and it does a great job of differentiating between confrontation and just being assertive.\n\nThis \"Assertive Bill of Rights\" is in the beginning of the book. I actually have to go back and read this to remind me of these things:\n\n>I: You have the right to judge your own behavior, thoughts, and emotions, and to take the responsibility for their initiation and consequences upon yourself.\n\n>II: You have the right to offer no reasons or excuses for justifying your behavior.\n\n>III: You have the right to judge if you are responsible for finding solutions to other people\u2019s problems.\n\n>IV: You have the right to change your mind.\n\n>V: You have the right to make mistakes\u2014and be responsible for them.\n\n>VI: You have the right to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n>VII: You have the right to be independent of the goodwill of others before coping with them.\n\n>VIII: You have the right to be illogical in making decisions.\n\n>IX: You have the right to say, \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n>X: You have the right to say, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nAlso, six years with no progress in therapy makes me think that maybe she should look for another therapist. Therapists have different specialties and can be good at different things. If she's not being actively pushed to assert her boundaries, how can she ever expect to grow?",
            "I once read great advice on this, and try to remember it: A people pleaser can be the toughest negotiator or anything like this, it only depends on WHO he tries to please. The person he negotiates with or his family / partner / etc. So maybe try get this into her head, that pleasing others is not nice towards you and she surely cares about pleasing you much more! If she's able to shift her perspective on that one, maybe it works better for you :)",
            "Your fiance isn't a people pleaser, but she is very immature.  Being able to stand up for yourself and be able to handle confrontation to some degree is a skill that should be developed as you mature into an adult.  This is not unusual, but she has somehow missed out this step in her emotional development.  \n\n6 years in therapy?  Doesn't seem like this is helping her grow in this respect.  Work on setting some healthy boundaries for yourself that forces her to accept her responsibilities as an adult in an adult relationship.  Or accept that you are in a relationship with a child?\n",
            "It's also an issue of loyalty-- pleasing random baker shouldn't be more important than keeping fianc\u00e9 safe. I'd explain it that way-- lots of the time you can't please everyone and need to prioritize by need, fairness, and loyalty.",

            "It's not the pleasing that's the problem, it's that she's prioritizing the avoidance of confrontation over both of your well-being. That's not a partner, that's a liability. If you can't count on her to look out for anyone's best interest except whoever is trying to take advantage of her at that moment, then how is she going to handle the shared responsibilities of adulthood or taking care of kids? What does she think is going to happen if a con man tries to get her to sign over your Power of Attorney, your property deeds, or your bank accounts? \n\n",
            "I think trust is an incredibly important aspect for relationships. We usually think about trust in terms of \"will they stay faithful or will they cheat?\" but it's far more complex than that. It also includes\n\n\"Can I rely on my partner to do what needs to be done?\"\n\n\"Will they do what they said they would?\" \n\n\"Can I talk to them about conflict without wondering if it will make things worse to communicate?\"\n\n\"Will they talk to me so I have an opportunity to address problems they might have with my behavior?\"\n\n\"Will my partner look out for my health and happiness?\"\n\nWithout a pretty high degree of trust.. I don't know. It may be one of those crucial elements that's actually on par with love and respect in a successful romantic relationship.",
            ">I think she puts her aversion to conflict above her/our long term goals, and she needs to find a happy medium. She doesn't understand how negatively this is impacting ~~her~~ **our** life.\n\nFTFY.  She is not a \"people-pleaser\", she is just plain spineless.  Adults need to stand up for themselves and their partners.  She would rather let someone steal from you than argue with a thief.",

            "Honestly if you think the hardest thing you'd have to face in your marriage is that you have to stand up for or take charge of situations for your wife then you are really not going to enjoy marriage with anyone.\n\nShe's got some issues to resolve, that's for sure.  It's sounds like she's got a fairly extreme case of avoidance but if you love this person enough to consider marrying her I'm shocked this isn't a message seeking help for her.\n\nIt sounds to me like you're in a relationship of convenience, you're not really invested and her issues aren't worth the effort to you.  You should not marry this girl, not because of her issues but because you're very obviously not in love with her.",
            "could be worse, you could be worried about her banging the contractor or her boss or the therapist or the cake guy . Idk sounds like a good egg but im not one to talk, maybe she just reminds me a bit of myself haha",
            "Yes, she needs therapy, and yes, you should postpone the wedding.\n\nBecause if nothing else, she doesn't know herself, and neither do you. You describe her as **\"really great person,\"** and **\"compatible in almost every other way.\"** But do you realize the extent to which THIS supposed compatibility is a by-product of her desire to please *you* and avoid conflict *with you*? \n\nYou may be shocked at the person who emerges when she begins to assert herself.",
            "Here's the thing. There are different types of people in this world and people are good at different things. You CANNOT trust your fianc\u00e9 to be an assertive person! Is that a deal breaker? Personally, for me it wouldn't be, but that's for you to decide. If anything involves negotiating money, standing up to people, Ect,\nThat is now your territory. For tomorrow I'd have a trusted friend or neighbor negotiate with the contractors if you can find one last minute. Don't count on her to be the breadwinner. Plan forward. Also, with the cake thing, why didn't you just assertively tell her to return it? Or call the bakery yourself and speak to them? \"There are nuts on my cake, I'm txting/e-mailing a pic right now. Please either refund our card or delivery a new cake within the hour.\" If they don't delivery have her trash it and pic up a new cake from Safeway.",
            "I think you are correct in your assessment that you are not right for eachother. \n\nI do not, however, think you are correct in your analysis of your girlfriend as someone who has made \"terrible\" mistakes. The world is full of liars, cheats, and outright criminals. Your girlfriend is terrible with money. But it's just money and you don't sound like you're starving because of the few thousand dollars she's wasted. Many couples get along just fine with one person managing the finances on their own. Many men have wives who don't bring in any income at all! That is clearly not what you are looking for in a spouse. That's fine. But I think it's gross how you portray her as some kind of lunatic as a means to justify leaving her. You're not compatible, that's fine, leave her. But the way you talk about her is gross imo. ",

She's already acknowledged she has a problem, telling her, you either change or I'm out, is not going to help her.  It's just going to add stress to her life and make the problem bigger.  It's all up to you.\n\nEdit\n\nI dont understand the downvotes so let me explain myself.\n\nLife is a box of chocolates:\n\n today you are hot surfer dude, tomorrow a shark bites your leg off and you are a paraplegic.\n\nToday you are a successful biz man/woman tomorrow you deal with panic attacks.\n\nIn your life you want a partner that can deal with that and sticks with you though the good and especially the bad.\n\nIf anybody tells you, change or I am gone, 99 % of the times they are telling you that they don't want to deal with your shit. So YOU should be the one that walks away. Last thing you want is to find somebody that dumps you as soon as they realize you are not perfect.\n\nIf you find yourself asking that question about your partner then you should ask yourself: is everything else about this person make it worth it to stick around or I really don't want to be here.  \n\nYOU have to choose, you cannot punt the decision to the other person!\n\nOtherwise you should just post a shittyaskreddit:\n\nMy girlfriend sucks but I really don't want to go back and jerk off so should i tell her to get bigger boobs or what?\n",

If 6 years of therapy haven't helped then I doubt much will. \n\nYou have to ask yourself if this is something you can put up with forever. I feel it may be one of those things that will eventually lead you to resenting her. Only you can decide if you can deal with it but if you can't then do the decent thing and break it off with her sooner rather than later for her sake.

        "selftext": "[Original](https://redd.it/3ppv92)\n\nHi reddit. I'm here with a very sad update.\n\nWhen I wrote my original post, I was about 18 weeks pregnant with Ethan. In the middle of December, at 26 weeks, Ethan decided to come early. Unfortunately he did not make it. He was the most beautiful little boy. The two days my husband and I got to spend with him were the best of our lives. I have a picture of him on my desk and I'm looking at it right now as I write this. I miss him every day.\n\nChris and I were in a state of absolute shock and heartache. I don't remember much about the period immediately following losing our son, but I do remember just feeling absolutely crushed with guilt and sadness. I blamed myself for his death and I still do, although time and counseling have helped a bit. Most of the time I feel like I'm in a dream and soon enough I'll wake up and my belly will be big again and I'll feel Ethan kicking...Chris and I are leaning on each other as best we can, but obviously it's put a strain on our marriage. Any advice from anyone who's experienced the loss of a child would be greatly appreciated. I love my husband dearly and I have no idea how to support him while dealing with my own grief. We are seeing a counselor both together and separately, once a week.\n\nNow I guess I should discuss my father's response to losing Ethan. After he passed, we obviously let our immediate family members (parents and siblings) know what had happened. We asked them to keep it to themselves and that we (Chris and I) would make the announcement when we were ready. As you may expect, my father didn't respect our wishes. Less than an HOUR after we told them Ethan was gone, he sent out a mass text to his side of the family letting them know that \"Jake Jr.\" had gone to heaven and asking people to keep Chris and me in their prayers (for the record, Chris and I are not religious and my family has a history of not respecting that). Soon after that my phone was bombarded with calls and texts from people I had never even met expressing condolences that \"Jake\" had gone home to Jesus. Maybe I'm ungrateful, but I was livid. I had just lost my son and my husband and I had *expressly* told our families of our desire to keep it private until we could announce it the way we wanted to. And to add insult to injury, my father couldn't even acknowledge Ethan's name even in death.\n\nI called my father and EXPLODED. I took out all my grief on him, and goddamn it felt good. Long story short, I am no-contact with both of my parents (my mom defended my dad's actions), and I have no plans to allow them in my life ever again. I feel much better for it.\n\nSo...here we are a month later. Things have gotten a little bit better since much of the rawness has eased a little bit but I won't lie, the pain is always there. If anyone has any coping mechanisms, or advice on how to keep my marriage strong, I would really appreciate it. Also if this post was a bit jumbled or I sound like I'm \"distant\" then I am sorry. I'm in a perpetual state of numbness, like i'm in a dream. My therapist has told me that I often describe what happened like it happened to a friend of mine, not to me. She says that's my mind's way of protecting myself from the depth of my grief, and I'm sure she's right. Anyway, I just wanted to throw that out. Thank you for reading guys.\n\n**tl,dr: Our son was born prematurely and lived for two days. My dad was disrespectful following his death and I'm NC with my parents. Husband and I are coping as best we can, would appreciate any advice.**\n\n**Edit: I went to bed shortly after I wrote this and woke up to an outpouring of support and kind words. Thank you to everyone who sent me PMs or who left words of encouragement, Chris and I truly, truly appreciate them. I will try to respond to each and every one of you but it may take some time. Thank you so much for the love.**",

            "When I first read your post I was so angry I couldn't type. Selfish doesn't even begin to describe the kind of asshole Jake is. I'm still fuming just thinking about it- how fucking DARE he make this tragedy about himself. How DARE he capitalize on the death of a BABY. What kind of sociopath would do that to his own daughter? compound her loss, compound her physical injury?\n\nI know I'm ranting but that's what he's done, he's added insult to injury.

If you look back there are probably other times he has done this.  To do anything other than love and support you right now is Inexcusable. No contact is the right idea. Treat yourself kindly, you deserve it and try counseling for added support.",
            "Ok, so know its a lateral from Reddit as usual but my gf has experience here and I don't so she will be taking over to post:\n\n\nI lost a child, named Daniel Thomas. Initially the pain and hurt is insufferable and no way to escape it and just let it happen. People try to minimize it (happened at birth, didn't really know him, etc. Etc. ) do not allow this, he is your don and will always impact your (and your families life). One thing that helps is I celebrate my son's birthday every year, to never allow him to fade (helps in many ways, kinda just good for me to know other people acknowledge him)",
            "Haven't lost a child myself, but my older sister did. This was almost 10 years ago now. She gave birth just after she turned 18 but he was about 3 months early. They took him via c-section due to complications. He had all kinds of health problems and died 27 days later on my 16th birthday. And all this just 5 months after the unexpected passing of our mother.\n\nMy sister had a hard time with it. But she had the support of our whole family. Part of the problem she had was that after her son died the father kind of fell off the face of the earth. While she had her siblings and father there, she was still kind of alone in that respect. I lost my nephew, but she lost her *son*. It just isn't the same.\n\nYou're going to need all the help you can get. And the fact you're going to counseling is huge. That may not seem like much now, but it'll make a huge difference in the long run. Also, make sure you talk to your husband. He's going to be a huge support for you. But also keep in mind that he's going to need you to be there for him just as much.\n\nThat kind felt like rambling, but anyways, on to your father...\n\nI don't want to sound insensitive here, but your dad is a colossal prick. I can understand (to a degree) wanting to tell people what's going on, but to completely disregard your request, and use a fake name to boot, well... there are no words to describe it honestly. Just good on you for kicking him out of your life, you don't need that selfishness right now.",

            "I'm so sorry. My son will be 1 on Wednesday the 27th. I was never great with kids and didn't think I'd be a father in my mid-20s like I am now, but I've never loved anyone even half as much as I love him. I couldn't imagine losing him.\n\nAnyway, I think I'd have the same reaction as you did with regards to your father telling everyone even after you asked him not to. That part stuck out to me most, I think.\n\nMy dad died when I was 10. It was very sudden. He had a brain aneurysm and died pretty much out of nowhere. I had never really dealt with the death of someone close to me before, so I didn't really know how to process it or deal with it. I was just numb. But more than anything, I just wanted to be left alone in a quiet space to be with my thoughts. I wanted to talk to someone when I was ready.\n\nOver the next week, DOZENS of people showed up out of nowhere to show their support. All these people from my mom's job, my dad's family, their friends, friends of friends; most of these people, I had no idea who they were. All of them would come up to me and fill me with platitudes: \"sorry for your loss\", \"it was part of God's divine plan\", \"your daddy is with Jesus now\", \"God called him home\", \"your daddy always wanted a Harley, I bet he's riding one in Heaven\", you get the idea.\n\nI know they were trying to help, but holy fuck did I hate it. Just leave me alone, Goddammit! I think I was too young and awkward and afraid to offend the adults to articulate that I wasn't okay with it and just wanted to be left alone. My mom thought I was \"withdrawing\" and \"running away from (my) grief\", so she kept pushing me to open up even though I wasn't ready. And the funeral, holy shit, that was bad. All these people got in a long line when the service ended and did the same thing. One person after another, the same platitudes spoken over and over again as they were leaving the funeral home. It didn't help, I just sobbed in both grief and frustration. That was a bad day.\n\nMy point is this: It takes time to collect yourself and allow others in following such a devastating loss. You weren't ready for that tidal wave of people bombarding you. You **know** they mean well, but that doesn't make it better. I know how that feels. \n\nYour father is a very selfish person who refuses to respect your boundaries, and your mother enables his toxic bullshit. You don't need that in your life. I think what you need now is support - but on **your own terms**.\n\n**TLDR: Had a similar experience when I was kid. OP's reaction was absolutely valid and understandable. The father's response was fucked up and not what OP needs right now.**\n\n**EDIT: spelling, grammar, etc.**",

It sounds like you are doing the best thing with counselling and just try and take care of each other.\n\nMy wife turned round after Christmas, and said \"I didn't cry today\".

            "I wrote this a while ago in response to another post.....\nMy first baby died unexpectedly during labour. Honestly, I think the only thing that is guaranteed to help is time. When Joshua died, it felt as though I was surrounded by many many enormous, overflowing untidy bags of emotions. And gradually, gradually, as the weeks passed, I would go over things in my mind and have occasional moments of...not forgetting, but suspension of pain, before it flooded back. And those emotional bags got repacked and condensed and became less unwieldy, and eventually I could even move around with them. And now, 3 amazing children later, I have a precious but tiny and distilled package in my heart, and he goes through my mind most days, but the memory, while emotional, isn't painful. With the luxury of time I'm able to think.....well, he wasn't meant to be, and they were, and that's just how it is. You learn to get along with things, you don't \"get over\" them. You get used to it. \nI'm so very sorry for the loss of Ethan. Just keep holding hands with your husband, literally and metaphorically. You sound strong and brave, and you WILL be ok.

When I went through that time I acted like a child. Reverted to childhood mindset and actions. I felt rushed to move on and feel better. My best advice is do not rush yourself. It will take a long time to recover and that's okay. The fact that you're still working through everything is something that people couldnt even imagine or get through life after this type of loss. Take your time to keep yourself safe and just moving day to day. You will feel better eventually. It will be a hard road I wont lie.

            "Hi OP. I dont know if this will get read among so many other comments, but I guess I wanted to offer what I learned from my experiences. I have a familiar genetic disorder that makes it more difficult to produce \"good\", genetically sound eggs. Because of this, I have to expect to have miscarriages throughout my life. As long as I am sexually active, it will always be possible. My mother had this problem, and my grandmother, and her grandmother. It goes for many, many generations.\n\nI got pregnant with my first baby at 17. He/she did not last very long, but I felt the impact. I know its not the same to miscarry a baby VS getting to feel that life in your hands. I just wanted to say, if your relationship fails after this horrible tragedy do not blame yourself. Im not saying it WILL fail, but sometimes that does happen. When a parent loses his or her child it does strange, yet natural things to them mentally and physically. You guys are in a weird state. I have faith in yall, though.Yall are making some great steps taking therapy together. Make sure to talk this out, and take the comments from this post so you guys both know what to expect and logically know what is going on in both of yalls minds. Its so easy to ignore that your partner is facing a horrible battle of his own when you are feeling so lost and profoundly hurt. So try not to let your emotions interfere with what you know. \n\nIts going to take you a long time to \"recover\". You probably wont ever *fully* recover but know that you can definitely become more functional than you are now, more emotionally stable and content with things.\n\nDont blame yourself for that death. You cant control your body, you couldnt control that babies body. I *know* you would if you could, but what happened couldnt be helped. Something that helped me a lot was understanding that it is more natural for babies and children to die than we think. It happens everywhere in nature, everyday. What happened *was* natural. Tragic, but natural.\n\nIm so sorry your family has made this hard for you. It may seem like the world/life never permits you enough time to greive what happened, but you take those moments when your alone and sad, or angry, or feeling helpless, and you live them. Let yourself feel them. Work your way *all the way through them*. Its *ok* if you dont feel ok right now. Just know that someday you will\n\n",

Find joy in the small things in life. Appreciate yourself, your husband, and the people in your life that you do value. Make good use of your energy and put it towards positive activities that bring you any sort of happiness, no matter how small. Remember, none of what happened was your fault. I won't say these things happen for a reason, because that's BS; life is chaotic and senseless, and sometimes we get stuck in the middle. \n\nIt is my firm belief that for the short time Ethan was with you and your husband, you shared something incredibly special and profound.

Decades later, she read the obituary of an infant in the paper and wrote a letter to the boy's mother. I don't have any advice, but perhaps this can help comfort you in some small way, from someone who has been down the same path:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As one mother to another my heart aches for you. My first baby, also a little boy, died 25 hours and seventeen minutes after birth. They, the medical people, said, 'It was a blessing and that his life would have been very difficult. It would never have been a normal life.' Family and friends said, 'He is in heaven; you have to trust God; you have your own angel now; it was better this way; you\u2019re young, you\u2019ll have others; easier to lose him now than later.' And on and on.\n\n\n\nToday, I have five children, their mates whom I love dearly, and 12 grandchildren who are the light and joy of my life. Yet when I think of my firstborn child, I still feel that hole in my heart. The hurt is not so sharp as to take my breath away now, but always there is that ache, that missing piece. The truth is, I never want it to go away. He is a part of me forever, as your sweet baby will be part of you always.\n\n\n\nIt is good that you were able to mother your son, to hold him in your arms. To love and know him, if only for a while. It is good that your son could feel your arms around him and know your love, if only for a while. And your love for that tiny little boy will last forever. May that love lift you, hole you close, and give you peace.\n\n\n\nDear mother, be well. Be comforted, and rest in the love of family and friends.\"\n",

Your both hurting, and while it's hard not to, try not to lose sight of the fact that the other person is hurting too when you're having an especially bad time.  If you can keep each other's pain in mind, while being rocks for one another, I really think your marriage can survive this.\n\nI'm truly rooting for you guys.

So that's where I'm coming from here.\n\nSo the things that spring to mind are:\n\nI have known people in this situation who have gone on to have children, and while I know their pregnancies were nerve wracking (to say the least), they have a very healthy and happy and very much wanted teenage son now.  They are happy people, although I know without asking that they've never forgotten their infant daughter.\n\nAs for the couple who lost a 6 month old--they experienced a period during and after his life of distance and separation from each other (it was especially awful for my friend's wife), but with the support of each other and their friends they made it through and are stronger than ever.  They have two healthy children now (one from before their son and one from after), and they took their loss as a sign to totally reorient their lives to be living the way that they really want to--I won't disclose details because it's reddit, but I'll just say that they packed up and moved across the country to somewhere beautiful and started their own business and busted their ass at it and they're steadily succeeding and happy.\n\n3rd, I recently read a (great) self-help book by Augusten Burroughs (for anyone reading my comment history, yes I am on an Augusten Burroughs binge), and something that leaped out at me (due to my dad's experience, which definitely affected my life growing up) was this (paraphrased because I can't find the text online):\n\n\"Someone should tell people who have lost a child that they will never heal.\"\n\nAnd he goes on to talk about how they will grow and change, and deepen for the experience, and how the love for their future children and the rest of their life doesn't need to be negated by the grief that will always be a part of the in some way.\n\nThere's such a culture of silence around the loss of children that someone speaking those words frankly instead of platitudes is something worth hearing.  Maybe for you?\n\nGood luck OP.  I'm glad those couple days you got were good.",

            "Your loss is your own.  Remember to breathe. There will be times you and your husband will really need each other and times when you both will need to be alone.  Those times do not always match up, so you both should try to respect and recognize the difference.  It doesn't mean anything bad for your relationship.  Sometimes you don't even know what you need, and that's ok too.  Just take a moment and really evaluate how you're feeling so you know how to proceed.  Giving yourself a short timeout is a perfectly acceptable coping mechanism.  \n\nYou are strong enough to handle this, even when it feels like you can't. You will always feel the loss, but you don't have to let it define the rest of your life.  ",

You were not wrong in getting mad at your dad; he crossed SO MANY boundaries doing what he did. It's an incredibly narcissistic move. He was more concerned about his feelings than yours, and you deserve better than that. Especially in such a hard time. \n\nConsider having a private memorial service or something. Your son may not have been born after a full pregnancy term but you deserve closure. \n\nObviously get/continue therapy. Consider having date nights in a couple months to have some fun and reconnect with your husband. But also don't pressure yourself to feel \"better\". You literally lost a child. 10 weeks doesn't make a difference to many parents, as far as love and grief goes. \n\nSending you and your husband love and good wishes. Keep fighting. I'm so sorry you have this loss. But you will have a child. One way or another, you can have one. ",

I'm so sorry he decided to make it worse by not acknowledging Ethan's name. \n\nYou mentioned you are not religious. I'm not either, but I understand why some people lean on it at times like this. It comforts then to think that their loved one is somewhere \"up there\" watching them. \n\n But, think on this: for one brief, beautiful moment, Ethan lived.

I cannot tell you anything to feel better, and it is not going to get better any soon, but just remember that your life was already beautiful with your husband before losing Ethan. Get back to that, start from scratch... rebuild it again, because the potential is still there. Also, remember that miscarriages and premature deaths are biological accidents that happen quite often, and I know that this is not relieving, but IT WAS NOT YOUR FAULT.

I choked up, there were tears for both of us. I remembered your raw grief. I am so sorry this has happened to you. Ethan will always be in your heart. You both have touched our hearts, too. \n\nAs for me (and despite everyone's recommendations at the time) I got pregnant again right away.

Personally I hate the hole Jr. thing the son will forever be known as Jr. or \"Little such and such\".\n\nThird check to see if you have any mental health coverage on your healthcare plan, if you don't maybe your Dr. can refer you to a woman's group who can set you up with someone to talk to to work through all of this.\nGood luck!",

Most of the people that responded knew I was pregnant, people I had never heard of. I was somewhere between mental break and homicide.\n\nI responded to my mother's post with one of my own- a note telling people that if they want to pray, do so for my mother who is having a hard time handling the loss of my pregnancy at 8 weeks, a time when no one outside of immediate family and close friends should have known of the pregnancy (some would argue only I, my doctor, and the father should have known). I went on to talk about miscarriage statistics and explained how I was not upset by my miscarriage because it meant something wasn't right with the fetus and this happened for a reason. No one else commented on her post after that, nor did I receive anymore private messages of condolence.\n\nMy mother acted insulted as I expected she would, and basically told me it was to keep me from having to tell people. In reality, she's just an attention whore.\n\nI am so sorry you lost Ethan. I'm sorry your father took it upon himself to be an asshole. But no contact is perfectly okay and right now, I think it's best. I wish I had with my mother.\n\nMy heart goes out to you, Chris, and Ethan. ",

While I was taming a shower, he looked through all of the photos on my laptop and yelled at me cause I still had photos of me and my ex. I didn\u2019t even remember, cause I don\u2019t look at those photos and I guess I was too lazy to delete them. Also, I don\u2019t use that laptop so often since it\u2019s slow, soooo yeah, I wasn\u2019t being sentimental.\n\nI\u2019ve always been a nosy person and I admit I stalked his wall, his exes, even his parents, BUT it was all public info. I\u2019ve been alone with his laptop/phone etc. but I\u2019ve never ever even thought about reading his private conversations. I wouldn\u2019t do that to anyone. He doesn\u2019t care, though. He memorized my ipad password and he read everything, including some really private posts here on reddit. He yelled at me and broke up with me. \n\nHe occasionally lurks in my facebook account, because I\u2019m dumb and I\u2019m always like \u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t do that again\u201d but he always does. Today I was logged on our shared laptop and I saw in my fb app that there was some activity going on 40 minutes ago while I was taking a shower. I looked the chrome history, but he had deleted everything. I lost it and I started crying and he had the audacity to blame me for his trust issues and said that there is something I\u2019m hiding since I\u2019m reacting this way. I tried to explain I have nothing to hide, but it\u2019s just horrible to feel uncomfortable at home. I can\u2019t even sleep properly anymore because I\u2019m nervous if he\u2019ll decide to randomly read my messages. He scrolled maybe months of my fb searches which is really embarrassing and yelled at me again. He said I must be hiding something since I\u2019m so upset. I don\u2019t hide anything and I never gave him a reason not too trust me. Once he dumped me and I grabbed a beer with an old friend and he found out, blamed me for cheating on him and even complained to my mother. I go to therapy every week (not only because of him, I have other issues). There was this group session and I met a boy who has similar problems to mine and I felt that finally I\u2019d have someone outside therapy to talk to. He\u2019s not my type and I didn\u2019t like him in a romantic way, I just felt we could be friends but my boyfriend found out we\u2019ve talked once (because he was snooping again ofc) and again yelled at me. He said I was a cheater and that\u2019s why he had trust issues. I\u2019ve always been faithful and I didn\u2019t deserve this. \n\nI changed all my passwords but I\u2019m tired of feeling uncomfortable in my own home. He went out and told me I deserve this and he\u2019s right to invade my privacy and I have no right to be mad. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\n\nTl;dr: Boyfriend is invading my privacy and blames me for his trust issues \n\nUpdate: Thank you so much for the comments and support! I finally picked up some courage and ended this pathetic excuse of a relationship and you all helped me a lot! Two days ago he came with his mother (omg) to collect his stuff and also took the laptop he gave me as present, which was pathetic. I\u2019m feeling so much better now. Thank you again for the support and messages! You\u2019re awesome.",

Life can be really hard and you need someone by your side who is going to be there with you when things are good and when things REALLY SUCK!

The man you want to hold you when you cry and laugh over all your inside jokes when you are old and grey. Why waste the time with him now unhappy when you can be single and independent or dating and available to meet the man of your dreams? The man who makes you feel safe and secure and who you know you cannot live without?

He was just an insecure alcoholic whose feelings of inadequacy were amplified by booze. He looked through my phone while I was asleep and found a text conversation between a male co worker and me. There was absolutely nothing sexual or romantic in that conversation(most of our conversations were about books and authors we liked.

Ever. Doing so puts you into really bad relationships. Relationships needs to be healthy, if they, and you, are to succeed long term.  \n\n\n\\* - If you're brave, hold off on #1, #2, and #5, get your hands on an audio recorder, and wait until he shows up, and does one of his tirades.

One day in an argument over him going through my shit while I was in the shower I finally made it very clear how I felt, that I had no privacy and I was tired of rushing through my showers in fear of getting out and he\u2019s mad about some conversation I had etc. he finally got the picture and as far as I know he\u2019s stopped this behavior. Try to be very clear and tell him you\u2019re over it and it\u2019s unacceptable, it needs to stop. If he doesn\u2019t respect it then dump him, you\u2019re not married, you guys don\u2019t have kids, do you want to live this way forever? Take control of your life.",
            "I thought you guys split up? Are you guys on again off again? That's not a healthy way to create a relationship. Also you need to bear some of the blame. You stalked his ex and other stuff which is also disrespectful. I agree both of you have some PTSD which will not lead to a happy relationship. Break it off, leave each other alone, and don't make the same mistakes again next time unless you want to go through the same thing.",
            "This all sound to strange how can you allow this?  \nYou know...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthere is limits\n\nand if you didnt cheat him before, i SEE no reason for him to be making that!!!",
            "You should probably talk to him.\n\nBut, if you\u2019re going to be in a relationship, you shouldn\u2019t ever send a message you wouldn\u2019t want them reading. It\u2019s disrespectful. I mean, to your mom, best friend, or sister is different, you know. But if you\u2019re talking to a different guy and you don\u2019t want him reading the messages, something is wrong with the convo. Present yourself in private just as you would in front of him. It\u2019s the respectful thing to do. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s exactly weird that he went through your photos. Photos are memories and they\u2019re meant to be shared, in most cases. So many times I\u2019ve just sat being bored and decided to look through photo albums, phone pictures, etc. it wasn\u2019t invading anyone\u2019s privacy. It\u2019s pictures. Also, depending on how long the relationship had been going on, I would be hurt if I had found pictures of my husbands ex\u2019s with him. The only problem I saw in that encounter was that he got overly angry about it even after you explained and deleted them. If you aren\u2019t over your ex or want to keep them, I think it\u2019s only fair that it is explained to the other person.\n\nIf he\u2019s very controlling or going through all your messages constantly, I completely see a valid reason for concern and possibly even leaving him. But, looking at pictures and getting hurt by a misunderstanding is not out of the realm of normal at all. ",
            "You two are incompatible. He needs someone willing to be totally open and share every single detail, and you clearly value privacy and independence. Find someone who shares your value of privacy and doesn\u2019t need proof to trust you. ",
            "I don\u2019t get why it\u2019s the new norm to surrender all privacy in the \u201cmodern\u201d relationship??? \n\nIt\u2019s okay to have things to hide. As long as it\u2019s nothing  too detrimental to a relationship of course. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to keep pictures of you and your ex. Those relationships molded you as a person. \n\nIt\u2019s just as much your responsibility for not having we clear boundaries in the first place. ",
            " Nah, sounds like you both have trust issues so it\u2019s acceptable to a certain extent. Just get a baby monitor and put both your minds at ease! ",
