        "selftext": "I'm sorry if this is jumbled, I'm on my phone and in total shock right now.\n\nI'm an only child that was bought up by my mum alone (my dad left before I was born). I love (well, loved) my mum to bits, she's done so much for me and sacrificed everything so I could have a good education and a happy life. I met my boyfriend when we were in university. We're both each other's first everything - first kiss, first sexual experience, first relationship. I love (again; well, loved) him with all my heart. I truly believed we would be together forever. We moved in together two years ago and our relationship has been practically perfect since then. We never fight, and he makes me feel like a princess everytime I'm with him.\n\nThis morning he woke up and went to have a shower. He left his phone on the bedside table, and when it vibrated I simply picked it up to check what the notifcation was for (I wasn't snooping, it was just habit to check it out when the sound went off). I honestly did not believe what I was reading. It was a text from MY mum saying something along the lines of: \"I hope your morning wood is as good as your afternoon wood ;).\" Obviously I freaked out and went into his phone (I know his pin code). They had been basically sexting for around a fortnight. Pics, stories of what they'd \"do to each other\", and worst of all reflection on an afternoon they spent together. I honestly can't remember what the texts specifically said, once I read them I locked his phone and bolted downstairs into our other bathroom. I pretty much just sat in the shower and sobbed until he left for work. Once he did, I threw on some clothes, grabbed my phone, purse, etc, and drove to a quiet nearby park - which is where I am now bawling my eyes out.\n\nI have no idea what to do. These were the two most important people in my life. I have pretty much no friends here. All of my extended family live overseas. I'm so heartbroken. Please help me.\n\ntl;dr - found texts that suggested my bf had sex with my own mum, i dont know what to do now\n\n",

            "You're in horrible shock, and rightly so. The two people in the world that were supposed to love and protect you didn't. They betrayed you in the worst possible way.  \n\nYou said in a reply to someone in this thread that you don't think you can survive without them.  YES YOU CAN. Get mad, get angry, get _furious_. And then get moving. Can you afford to live in your flat without your bf? If so, pack up all his stuff and kick him out. If not, find somewhere else to live, with a friend, a classmate, a cousin, whatever.\n\nCut him out of your life entirely. Block his number, don't answer the door, delete his emails. There is NOTHING he can say that would make fucking your mom acceptable. Don't let him try to rationalize it or make excuses. Don't let him manipulate you into staying with him. He's a loser, a liar and a cheat. \n\nMaybe, _maybe_ you can decide to go forth with a relationship with your mom, although it will be drastically different of course. I suggest taking some time to get a clear head before you even think about interacting with her.  I would ignore her calls and texts for however long it takes you to feel ready to deal with her, whether that be days, weeks or months. This will be the hardest part because she's your mom and you love her. But you need to take time to really think about what's happened and get right in your own head. Maybe you can decide to talk to her again, maybe not. Whatever you decide is right for you. \n\nMost of all, take care of yourself. I am so sorry this has happened to you.  I wish you strength to get through this.",
            "As another person commented, get verification that the person who texted your bf was in fact your mother. If it is, the situation is worse than some other random woman.\n\nIf you think you cannot survive without them, you're in for a lot of trouble. Who's to say they don't continue a relationship or start up again in the future? \n\nYour mother is supposed to be your rock, your guide, your supporter; not the person who bangs your bf. If it is in fact your mother, I would be utterly devastated of her betrayal more than your bf. Cut these two OUT of your life. It's toxic, and frankly you deserve better. \n\nYou CAN do it. It will be hard, if not one of the hardest things you ever do. However, you will never trust these people again. Imagine marrying this guy with your mother sitting in a pew knowing they were together? Yeah, that's some Jerry Springer nightmare. ",
            "That is fucking insane.\n\nYou need to dump your boyfriend and seriously consider whether you want your mother in your life at all anymore. This is seriously fucked up there's not much in the way of advice anyone can give you. Good luck.",
            "A friend of mine had this happen to her. Only thing is that her bf not only had sex with her mom but with her sister too. So, if you have any questions I can relay them to her. I'm not sure what, if any, questions you'd have but anyway. I'm so sorry this happened to you.",
            "If this is true, then cut both of these people out of your life. ",
            "Please find another family member or friend to go stay with for a few days/week. Take a few days no contact to wrap your head around this and come up with a plan of action.\n\n\nYour boyfriend crossed a line that should never be crossed, he is not somebody deserving of your trust.\n\n\nNot only did he sleep with her, he is currently continuing the affair. They have been doing this long enough to have considered your feelings on the matter and who knows how long they would continue if you hadn't found those messages!!\n\n\nTalk to them about it once you've had time to compose your thoughts, get your questions answered and take time to reflect. But honestly they've beyond fucked up.\n\n\nI'm an only child of a single mum too and just trying to imagine this is fucking horrific. That level of betrayal is just unforgivable, I think you should talk to a professional regarding moving past this. \n\n\nIn your situation I'd be fucking out of there the first chance I got and not looking back.",
            "You need to dump these two from your life, disgusting, disrespectful, garbage human beings. How horrible and horrendous. I'm so sorry you have to go through this at all. Pack your crap, and go. Honestly, if possible, I'd be gone before that piece of garbage gets back from work. ",
            "He's your first everything, even first breakup. You will survive this and find someone better",
            "I'm so sorry, that's so effed up and beyond.. Think you can give any of your family a call? You really need somebody to lean on and talk to. I would want to talk to your mom to understand what the fuck is going on in her head. :(",
            "This is honestly one of saddest things I've read on sub. You had two people you love most in this world send you a rather harsh message. They don't love you. \n\nThese two people are betraying you in the one way they know 100% it's going to cause the most chaos in your life and cause immense pain and they are both doing it without even the slightest sense of guilt. \n\nYour mother has raised you for 24 years to wind up being so fucking narcissistic she'd do this. \n\nPlease don't attempt to just jump back into a relationship with your mum. You seem desperate to forgive her which makes me wonder what kind of asshole parent she is that she's conditioned you to think she's that important in your life there's no limits to acceptable behaviour. \n\nDon't, talk to them just yet. A month, 3 months. Talking to a lamppost would probably be healthier then whatever these two have to say. \n",
            "This is not your fault. This is NOT your fault. This is NOT YOUR FAULT. \n\nNow that we're clear on that, I need to tell you something I read here once: the pain you feel right now is the most intense cognitive dissonance you will ever feel. It is a result of finding out that two people you loved, and thought loved you in return, didn't love you at all. You're mourning the loss of two people you thought existed. They haven't existed in a long time. \n\nWhen they chose to get together they killed the people you love. The people who will try to apologize, try to convince you they care about you, they're lying - the people who cared about you are dead. As soon as you realize this you will be able to start moving on.\n\nIt will be SO hard not to believe these monsters who look so much like the people you loved, but you have to believe me. They are gone. Mourn them, cherish what you had, but don't have any illusions about the fact that they are gone now. \n\nI wish you nothing but love OP, good luck.",

            "This may sound like a stupid question, but are you sure it was really your mum? And not someone else that he put the number as your mum? ",
            "Are you 100% sure it's your mum? It could be another number saved under your mom's name to allay suspicion.",
            "Okay. You have said that you still want these people in your life. How do you expect that to work? Do you pretend you never saw the texts and don't know anything? Do you confront your bf and tell him to cut it out with this other woman?\n\nExcept this other woman isn't a stranger, or a friend, or an acquaintance from a party. This other woman is your mother, and what they have done is so disrespectful and hurtful to you that this completely negates *anything* they have ever done for you to be nice. \n\nNo self-respecting woman would sleep with her daughters live-in boyfriend *while they were still together*, this woman does not respect you, and she did not care about your feelings when they were carrying this out and all the times they were sexting. Same goes for your boyfriend, of all the people he could cheat on you with, he cheated on you with *literally the closest person to you*. He is disgusting, they are both liars, he is a cheat, and he completely disregarded your feelings. \n\nTrust me OP, there is no scenario where you want these people still in your life. You CAN and WILL survive cutting them out. \n\nDo you have a friends you can go to for a few days? If so I advise you pack a bag with all your valuables, documents you need, and passport, and some clothes, and leave and go. You should be angry about this, you should be so furious that these two people could do this to you that you never want to see them again. Go to a friends, or even get a hotel room if you can afford it, start looking for flats you can live in or room shares or something because trust me, you will never be happy in a relationship where the guy has fucked your mum and consistently sexted her for weeks, and you will never be happy with your mum again either. ",
            "Isn't it more likely that the \"mom\" contact name is simply fake?",
            "I am so sorry to hear that your boyfriend and mother would behave in such a horrific way. \nPlease please keep telling yourself that this is not a reflection of you. I think many times, people in breakups blame themselves and think they must have done something to bring it on. Nothing about you, nothing you could have done would justify their selfish and stunningly hurtful behavior. \n\nConsider setting up an appointment with a professional counselor to get some support  in coping with this. \n\nI think it's okay to mourn the loss of the people you thought they were. It is basically like the people you thought you knew are dead now. However, please know that even though they turned out to be such awful people, you can create a new Chosen Family for yourself of people who do truly care about you and have your best interests at heart. \n\nLots of love to you. Please keep posting here so we know how you are doing. I know a lot of us are concerned about you. ",
            "Whatever you do for the next few days, please try to make sure you take care of yourself and your body. Eat well, try to sleep enough, exercise if you like in a way that makes you feel good, etc. This is hard enough without making enemies of your body, and it'll give you something productive to think about.",
            "Are you *100% sure* it was your mom? He could've put someone else's number in there under her name so you wouldn't get suspicious. Did you check the number?",
            "I can't really say anything other than \"what the actual fuck.\" \n\nDump the boyfriend and uh...yeah. Wow. ",
            "Once you've got a relatively long term place to stay you really need to speak to a professional. This is level of trauma is going to stick with you for a long time. You need to find someone to talk to that will make you feel safe and can give you professional level advice. Reddit is fine and good, there has been some good advice here, but PLEASE see a therapist. ",
            "Seriously where do you live. If you live anywhere near me I'm offering you a bed and a room. My fiance and I have it and lend it out to people in need. We have people crash here all the time ",
            "It is completely normal to be in complete shock. What you need to do is to go somewhere safe and quiet and have a think about the entire situation and acknowledge your feelings. After that, get into (or try to) a rational frame of mind and think about what they have done and what your next steps are going to be. \n\n\nI would recommend that you stay with a friend rather than alone in a motel, so that there is someone to take care of you and offer you emotional support at this time. If you have no friends, go to the nearest church and seek out a pastor/nun/church worker. (Not favouring a particular religion, but my point is to go somewhere where there is someone available to hear your story and give you some form of emotional support). Emotional support from a friend is especially important now because the 2 people you depended most on for emotional support has betrayed you in such a horrific manner. You're probably feeling alone and abandoned. So go seek support from a friend. With that temporary pillar of emotional support you will be able to calm down and clear your mind more effectively and think about what you should be doing. \n\n\nYou have said that your bf and your mum are the 2 most important people in your life. I am assuming the first thing in your mind is \"how do I fix this?\" In this situation there is no way both the relationship with your bf and your relationship with your mum can be repaired. You have to choose one or the other to salvage, or else the past will forever haunt and affect the dynamic between the three of you. Another option is to not choose any relationship to salvage and cut ties with both your mother and bf, which is completely reasonable given the extent of this betrayal.\n\n\nI'm so sorry this happened to you OP. Sending virtual hugs your way. Please keep us updated. ",
            "As someone who is super close to her mom, this is heartbreaking. I'm so sorry you're going through this. I don't think I'd be able to have a relationship with either of them after this. This is such a huge breach of trust, and there's no gray area here. What they did is incredibly fucked up. If I were you, I'd call someone who will let you stay with them, go no contact with both of them, and get an appointment with a therapist as soon as possible! \n\nGood luck! You can do this. You don't need people who do things like this in your life.\n",

            "Your BF is awful dump him and never think of him again. He isn't worth the orgasim his dad had. \nYour mother..... What kind of mother would do this? I honestly believe she is capable of much worse and should probably be cut from life. Maybe treat her like an aunt. See her in Holidays and that's it. I wouldn't spend anymore time with her. What a horrible woman.",
            "That's one of the most dreadful things I've ever heard. \n\nIt's probably too late as you posted this 5 hours ago, but I think you should start by changing the locks on the apartment and tossing his stuff out the window. \n\nOn second thought, it might be better to get a room where neither he nor your \"mom\" know where you are. And like others have said, therapy would be wise, because this is an honest-to-Betsy big trauma likely to leave emotional scars.",
            "I'm not as forgiving towards your mom as some on here. Sorry but I would hold her to a higher standard then just a boyfriend. \nI'd cut them both out of your life. How could she ever think she could redeem herself after betraying you like this. \nGet out of there and leave them both a message to stay away from you. \nI could sooner forgive an ex then I could my mom. ",
            "Yeah this has to be a punch in the gut. I'm sorry you have to go through this gal. I'm sorry that you had your mom do this to you, Can you call a friend/acquaintance and stay with them for some time? If not can you think about moving to some other place - a small hotel until you can get lodgings. You need time away from your bf and mum. I know it pains like a bitch right now and it will for some time, but you will need to cut these people out of your life. ",
            "This absolutely gut-wrenching and you have all the right to feel like you do. However, don't let that feeling stay for too long. You need to take care of yourself and get to a safe place. Your bf will start calling you when he sees you're not home. Don't answer for a while. Sent him a text just stating \"I need to be alone for a while, don't contact me until I contact you\". You need time to think before you confront him. He'll probably call your mom and she'll start calling you too. Proceed the same way. Don't let her know yet that you know how despicable she is. \n\nOnce you've gathered your thoughts and cried all you need to cry talk to them. Let them know you know what happened and that you don't want either of them in your life. Your bf forever, your mom for a really really long time, that time will depend on how she reacts to you telling her how much she hurt you. \n\nIn very sorry this happened to you. <internet hug> ",
            "I'm echoing some other advice here, but get angry. Be hurt, sad, betrayed and upset, but more than that, get angry. Being angry will fuel you to do what's best for yourself right now. Anger will keep you from caving of he wants you to stay, it's what will help carry you through the worst parts of the heartbreak. Don't be mad forever, but you deserve to be mad right now. I'd go so far as to say being angry is necessary right now.",

Two people who are supposed to care about you (one being the lady who is supposed to love you more than anything) betrayed you in the most hateful way. They are cancer.

            "You need to update on this. This is horrible. Find out if it really was your mother. Some people use different names on their cells to hide calls from they're getting and make things look \"normal\" to others. \n\nI hope you're alright. You do need to investigate.",
            "Sounds like one for the Jeremy Kyle Show :/, really a nightmarish situation and I'm very sorry OP. Obviously the sexting is bad enough but if he's cheated too time to jettison that baggage, is there anyone else you can turn to? Really solid friends to help you this situation? ",
            "You're strong, and obviously a better person than they are. You will grow from this. In the end, this will be the day that everything in your life became better, not worse. \n\nYou're leaving a horrible person behind.\n\n",

(Buy it if you) You just need to keep repeating that. A relationship can only work if both people are in it. If one person is then you are wasting time yo could be spending on yourself or someone else. You are number one. \n\nThere's a quote I've highlighted in it:\n\nEvery moment of pain, weakness, and discomfort puts you in a position to choose how you will react and how you will alleviate your condition. Calling him doesn\u2019t make it better\u2014it only pulls you back into the cycle of heartbreak. He is the past. You are the future.",

I'd put all your boyfriend's stuff into binbags and put it on the doorstep and tell him to leave when he got back (and not to your mum's house, either). \n\nIf you feel like you need to get away, though, do. Go to that motel and make your plans for the future, or ring your family overseas, tell them what's been happening and ask if they can find you somewhere to rent near them. Buy a one way plane ticket and don't look back. To be fair, your life is going to be radically different from now on anyway, so you might as well start totally anew. \n\nI wouldn't even justify my mother with a phone call. She'd just be erased from my life. ",

Title alone, even without the details, clearly these are two people who are supposed to love you and they screwed with you in a really gross way, and seem to show no remorse and have intentions of doing it again. One time thing? Fucked up, but maybe they have an explanation. Extended affair? Unforgivable, as far as I'm concerned. But you're you.\n\nI will say though that you need to talk to them. Don't take their bullshit or denials, don't be swayed that they didn't mean it when clearly they did. Hold your ground. But as you've said these are very important people in your life, and just cutting them out for good and storming away, while that might be the cleanest, is not really an option, is it?

It is simple to throw this kind of advice out there when they're not the one about to lose the two most important people in their lives.\n\nMy 2 cents: do what's right for you. Follow YOUR heart. You asked for advice and you got it - take the pieces that fit how you feel. \n\nPeople make mistakes.

All of the different opinions clashing together at once will overwhelm you.  \n\nI'm being a hypocrite by giving you advice after saying that but I figure I'll add my pennies.  This thread will help you after you have calmed your mind and can read everything in a subjective manner but right now (this is an assumption) you are finding a way to assuage your emotions and this can lead to you making irrational decisions based on the notions you derive from the onslaught of information.  \n\nIf you have the time and money make sure you eat and stay hydrated.  Thoroughly iron out all of your options.  Fact check when you feel ready to confront the situation and do not make any definite conclusions until you have extracted a sufficient amount of details to put yourself in a position of confident decision making.  Do not allow your mind to run wild thinking of what COULD be happening. Only go by the facts.\n\nIt is your life so I can't say much as to what you should do if your worst nightmare came true but at least from this point you will be able to rationalize.  Good luck. ",
            "A lot of people are advising you to walk away from your mom forever. I disagree. You only have one mom and since your father passed you only have one living parent. My advice is to take a big step back, which may include cutting contact for a while, and re-think things with this new information. It sounds like you and her had a not-terrible relationship before, that you felt like you could trust her and depend on her. Now in hindsight it's not completely true, but it's not completely false either. She provided other things for you. We can't help who our parents are. Sometimes they're broken, messed up people with bad judgment. But there's a lot to be said for having them in your life. You're going to have to draw a bright, bulletproof line between her and yourself and from now on everything is to be on YOUR terms, NEVER hers, but it's going to be worthwhile to maintain contact. \n\nTL;DR: Walk away for now but you're not required to walk away from your mom forever. Your future relationship will have to be on drastically different terms though.\n\nBut I really, really hope that it was some other person and your boyfriend disguised their number using your mother's name. \n\n",

Her boyfriend didn't seem upset at all and even though she's sad now, she'll get better and keep focusing on her education, which is important.\n\nNow I have to deal with my crazy family.

I was pretty surprised by the volume. I was trying to downplay my concerns about the incidents at my parents\u2019.\n\nI met up with Rachel at her place before maybe heading for dinner together. I let her know that I wanted to talk about what she said about my mom during vacation. \n\n(I\u2019m just going to provide a dialogue about what was exchanged to make it easier for me and hopefully less confusing.)\n\nMe:  I\u2019m still trying to understand why you said what you said at dinner and why you are in such disagreement with my mom.\n\nRachel: It\u2019s so weird how good looking your dad is still. He could have been a model when he was younger. Your mom is not anywhere in the same league as your dad. \n\nMe: I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re talking about.\n\nRachel: I think it\u2019s odd that they are together. It\u2019s creepy.\n\nMe: My parents love each other. I don\u2019t get the problem you have. I think that you purposefully brought up having kids earlier than my mom to criticize her.\n\nRachel: Well I don\u2019t like your mom. I don\u2019t have to like her.\n\nThe rest of conversation was more pulling teeth.  I had already given thought about what happened last weekend and I guess I share a chapter or two from my parents\u2019 book, I want to feel confident about my partner. Rachel gives me doubt, not comfort. \n\nA lot of comments mentioned that I may have been oblivious and what I initially perceived as frankness was likely always tactlessness, that I may have not noticed it was tactlessness because I was in agreement.  I think these were factors, but I also didn\u2019t agree with Rachel always on her opinions, I just didn\u2019t disagree either.\n\nI broke up with Rachel last night. Her parting words were \u201cA mama\u2019s boy is just plain ugly. And you\u2019re cursed with your mom\u2019s looks!\u201d\n\n**Edit**: So I rang my parents to let them know that I broke up with Rachel. I spoke with my dad first and he said, \u201cYou made a good decision. She was dumber than a box of hair.\u201d Then I spoke with my mom and she asked why I ended it. I told her that she was too irrational and contradictory. She wasn\u2019t convinced that was the entire reason so I told her everything since she has a pretty thick skin. She had a real good laugh and said that Rachel\u2019s just a mean girl and she\u2019s glad that it didn\u2019t take me longer than 8 months to work that one out. And she also told my dad that he's still got it. \n\n**TL;DR**: Broke up with Rachel. She was tactless to the end.\n",

I will say, however, that if I had said something like what she said about being allowed to stay in the same room (more out of talking out loud) I would have later said to my boyfriend \"What a total dork I am!\" after realizing that I said it out loud.\n\nTo add to that, I am one of those people that takes 'intent' into consideration in many situations if not all. \n\nPersonally, I don't know if either of the comments about having kids at 30, or even the sleeping arrangement comment were meant to be mean spirited. Fact is--after 30 your chances for having down syndrome babies increases (especially after 35)-perhaps that's what she meant? Obviously, many people have kids after that and many do not have down syndrome kids but her comment was not far-fetched and I honestly don't know if keeping in mind when your parents had you attributed to what you perceived as an 'insult'-even though, based on many of the comments, many others are  perceiving it that way too.\n\nPeople say goofy things when they are young, when they are nervous etc. I think it would have been more productive if you had voiced all these thoughts to her and let her respond.

            "Good riddance, really.\n\nOne thing tho, that I think is worth for you to consider (no need to even reply to me, just for you to think about, really). After your first post I was left thinking that she seemed like one of those people who will bring up things she doesn't agree with just to be antagonistic. I still think she is that kind of person and that it is great for you to have broken up with her.\n\nBut. Her parting words and the fact that she seems to flat out resent your mom, and not your dad, make me wonder if, in the time you have been together, you have not done/said stuff that had made her feel that way. If you have, that is also not necessarily a bad thing. She may just be insecure and hearing you talk positively about your mom made her jealous/resent her - which again says it is a good thing you broke up with her. But there is the chance that you are too attached to your mom, and that it shows in the way you talk/act, and that is why she felt this way. Even if that was the case, the way Rachel handled it was shitty, and you are still better off, but it is worth taking your time to figure out if there is a chance you may be overly attached to your mom, just so that you don't let it have a negative impact in any future relationships that may be worth pursuing.",
            "I agree with Rachel, you sound like a mamas boy. You should not have broken up with her because her opinions were different from your parents. Newsflash, your parents are not the gold standard for how to act in life. You're going to have a hard time dating until you realize that the only woman like your mom, is your mom. ",

We have a 3 year old son together that I love more than anything in the world. She had primary custody of him because I feel like a child should never be torn away from his mother, unless the mother is abusive and/or can't raise him properly. Plus, I get to see him whenever I like.\n\nSo yesterday afternoon, I picked up my son up from his mom's house to spend the rest of the day with me. She went out for drinks later with her friends. I thought nothing of it, because she has done this a ton of times. \n\nI got a call around 11pm from one of her friends, a call that I never want to hear about someone I'm close with. According to her friend, she was super drunk and couldn't even walk properly. She ran out onto the street and a car hit her. She was rushed to hospital and she died on the way there.\n\nI'm in so much pain right now. I loved this woman. We have a beautiful child together. How will I eventually explain this to my son? \n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Ex-GF died after a car hit her. We have a child.",

            "Firstly, I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nSecond, your son is at a pretty vital age where child development occurs, particularly where bonding/attachment is concerned, so I think /u/Montaron87 is spot on when he/she suggests consulting a child psychologist.\n\nLastly, as a mother the only thing I fear about dying is my kid not being ok when I'm gone. You sound like a good man who loves his child, and in order to do what's best for him you have to look after yourself as well. \n\nTake any support offered to you by friend and family. Develop a steady new routine with your son as soon as possible. Talk to a child psychologist for him and a grief counsellor for yourself. Take care.",
            "I am so very sorry for your loss. Grief is hard and awful but eventually it gets better, though your life is never the same again. Make sure you have support of family and friends around you as you deal with the upheaval to your life and that of your son.\n\nIt will be a long road ahead to getting better. Your son will have many questions, and how you explain this death to him will change as he gets older. For now he is 3 and you can tell him something like because of a sad accident mommy's body stopped working and that you and mommy love him very much. Over everything he needs to be reassured that you love him. Kids at three are very literal and do not really grasp the finality of death. Having a therapist guide you in dealing with questions from your son, as well as your own grief, is very important.\n\nI really am so sorry for your loss. ",
            "(((hugs)))\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.\n\nContact her family - who will be making funeral arrangements?  \n\nFile for SSI dependent benefits for your son.  The monthly payments will help a lot.\n\nHe's 3 yrs old right now, so you can say Mommy's gone, and keep him busy and distracted.  Counseling will help you with the ways to discuss it with him in an age appropriate manner.  \n\nIs his child care close enough to keep?  Let them know the situation.  You may want to look into a nanny or au pair.  The survivors benefits will help pay for that.\n\nTake care of yourself! ",
            "I am very sorry for your loss, even if you were broken up, you had a connection and a history. Right now you need to rely on the support of family and friends and I assume you will have custody of your son which will be a major life change. When he asks keep it simple and at 3 he might not really understand the concept of forever and not coming back, so you tell him his mother loved him and you love him and give him time to grasp the not coming back. This will be so hard for both of you and you have my profound sympathy.",
            "Your son has a new reality, the death of his mother and living with you full time. A child psychologist will definitely help you pave the way to this new reality. \n\nHe's going to have lots of questions. Be honest, yet age appropriate. I'm sure there are good how-tos online on how to explain death to toddlers. \n\nMake sure he has his own space in your house, if you haven't already. Incorporate as much of his stuff from her house into it, so that he can find comfort in familiar things. It may also help his young mind understand more that mommy is gone if his stuff is in your house. \n\nTry and keep as much routine as possible. Young children thrive on routine and predictability as they don't understand the continuum of time.\n\nTry and keep some of the same routine he had with his mom, i.e. if Grandma watched him Thursday nights, continue that date. Don't change his pre-school yet. Incorporate changes slowly one at a time.\n\nMake sure you have a good support system for yourself so that you don't get burned out, as well as your own grief counselor.\n\nBest of luck to you and your son.",

Ask your lawyer about what else needs to be done - social security benefits for your son being a big one.\n\nFortunately, he is very young. He will miss his mother, but at this age it is easier to overcome. There are many children's books dealing with loss of a parent or loved one and how to explain it in a way they will understand.\n\nIn the meantime, please find some grief counseling. Not only will it help you, it will help you be prepared to deal with discussing with your child about what happened to his mother.

She wouldn't sleep if her mom wasn't home and wouldn't sleep in her own bed for some time. It is perfectly normal for kids to develop anxiety over losing their other parent but with a therapist you can keep it in check.\n\nYour son really just needs you to be with him now.

Contact them, tell them you loved their daughter (although in this case you'll need to add \"but obviously it couldn't be\") and that you want them to still be in your sons life as much as they've always been. Find out when she has been used to having them care for your son or visiting them with your son or having them round to visit your son,  and organise to take up the same deal if they'll do it for you.

Never been so sad for a stranger before...I really wish there was something I could do to help you. You and your kid hang on to each other now. He's missing a huge part of what kids need during their childhood. He's gonna have a hole in his heart where his Mom used to be...and how big that hole is and how much it affects him now lies in what you do next. The two of you are best buddies now...you're all each other have. Make him the center of your world. What a painful ordeal for a child to lose his mother so young! This is heart breaking!

Going out for a drink is one thing, getting shitfaced like that is entirely another.\n\nIn my mind the best way to explain it is to do so in two stages.  The first being that she was out partying late at night and got hit when she was not being careful crossing the road.\n\nThe second would come later, after they are a little more mature.  That she got hit when she was not being careful crossing the road because she was so drunk she could barely walk.\n\nThe first is useful for helping reinforce the idea of looking where traffic is and where it will be prior to a road crossing.  The other helps with the idea of drinking is okey, but do so with moderation.\n\nThe girl was a cheater and a drunk, sounds like a party girl that never grew up and it will scar your child's life.",

I had last spoke to him on Wednesday, where I told him unless he could let go of the past and stop bringing things up, then this relationship was over. I was done being the emotional punching bag. I ended up breaking up with him on Saturday. I wasn't sure what I was going to do, but there were a couple of things that really sealed the deal for me.\n\nWhen he came in the house, I hadn't even brushed my teeth yet so I went to go do that. As I'm brushing my teeth, he immediately stated that I was brushing my teeth wrong, and, \"When are you ever going to listen to me about how to brush your teeth?\" Then, when we went to my room, he asked how much I had cried since Wednesday. When he said this, he looked happy. Like it made him happy that I was so upset about this whole thing, like he took it as flattery. \n\nIt was at that moment I knew it had to be over. I love him so much, and am pretty miserable, however I know I needed to do it. I keep thinking that if I were in his shoes, and the relationship was so rocky, I wouldn't be criticizing him on how he brushes his damn teeth. \n\nWhen I was breaking up with him, he kept saying this was the wake up call, and he was going to change. That I was giving up on him, and at least he can say he tried and I can't say that. He was relentless, but I stuck to my guns. Before he left, he told me he really hoped I would see a therapist, because I needed help. \n\n\nIt should also be noted that I am the same user who wrote a relationships advice post about having a boyfriend who wanted me to change my hair color. I'm pretty sure I deleted the post, so I cannot link it, but I honestly should have listened to you all then and not gotten so invested in someone who constantly felt the need to want to change me through controlling comments. \n\nEDIT: OH MY GOD! You guys are so awesome. I have been so upset, but reading these posts have further let me know I did the right thing. The hardest part is that there were great times, and even reading my posts I worry that I was too hard on him and painted him too negatively, but I'm seeing now that this is just me making excuses. I feel terribly guilty about how sad he must be, but I know this will soon fade. You are all absolutely amazing and kind.\n\nJust to clarify, I was the girl whose boyfriend wanted her to stop bleaching her hair blonde because he couldn't date me unless he saw me \"natural\". \n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend and I broke up, absolutely heartbroken but know it had to be done.

            ">He kept saying this was the wake up call, and he was going to change.\n\nExcellent. So if you start having niggling doubts about taking him back, remember that if you get back together he will no longer have the motivation to change.\n\nI also read your previous thread and I can guarantee that everything he's told his therapist about your relationship was a distortion of reality, half-truths, and outright lies. He didn't go in there and say \"I stop my girlfriend from spending time with her family through passive-aggressive manipulation\" - he said \"I feel like she's prioritising her family over me.

This could help you avoid people like this in the future! \n\nI think in time you'll find that you loved his potential, not the man he actually was. I highly doubt you (or anyone) could genuinely love someone who is happy that they made you miserable. A therapist could potentially help you really move on from the mess he tried to turn you into.

            "I somehow read your sentence as \u201cI stuck to my gums\u201d, and I was imagining you brushing your teeth as you ditched him. Well done OP. Love the way he threw in a few undermining comments on his way out the door. What a prince. ",

            "I haven't seen any mention of this yet, so allow me:\n\nFor the sake of your mental health, it would be wise to block your ex on any and all platforms which can be used to communicate with you. Because, frankly, if you think this is over you're most likely wrong.\n\nFirst up is via your phone. Google 'ios block caller' or 'android block caller' depending on your phone for instructions on how to block a caller. All modern phones have this feature; your phone would have to be pretty old not to.\n\nNext is social media. I'm sure you're young enough that you can find the ways to block people on various platforms. If you can't, a quick google search will clear it up. Block him on all of them.\n\nLastly, email. Depending on your email provider, there's usually a way to setup a rule that automatically deletes mail from a certain address. So as to not make this a novel, I'm going to tell you to google for the instructions on how to do that *yet again*.\n\nBeyond that, you two may have mutual friends and acquaintances. Don't be surprised if he tries to use them as messengers. However, you have the truth on your side and you shouldn't be afraid to use it. Honestly, if someone takes his side over yours you probably don't want that person in your life anymore. After explaining to anyone what kind of abusive jerk this guy was, follow up by changing the subject. If they push the old subject, remind them you don't want to hear messages from your ex and that's final. They keep pushing, and it's probably someone you don't want in your life.\n\nThis may all seem extreme, but a manipulative abuser will usually try every trick up their sleeve in order to unbreak-up. Because it's way easier to control and manipulate someone you've been controlling and manipulating for 18 months than it is to groom someone new. Best for you to get ahead of that and cut off all the things he could use. Plus, you're got better things ahead for you without that jerk in your life ;)",

            "So earlier this year I got fired from a job that I loved. I was heartbroken when it happened. I felt like a failure and I felt so upset that moving on to a new job meant I wouldn't be able to do the work I was so passionate about that I had done at my prior place of employment. \n\nBut with time, the wounds didn't just heal. It allowed me to reflect on how the manager who fired me was a toxic, corrupt, untrustworthy person. Working under her was a constant struggle, but the positives of the job made me think of it as \"not that bad\" or \"worth putting up with.\"\n\nIt's not a relationship, but it shares a lot of those commonalities. And I guess it's my way of saying to you that I know it hurts right now, because it's still so close by, so raw. But with time, you'll realize how much better your life is without that toxicity, and you will heal. I wish you nothing but the best. ",

Don\u2019t ever believe a word that this abusive sadist says. You tried to make it work. You gave him plenty of opportunities to do the right thing and he squandered them all. He is the one who needs therapy. He is the messed up individual.\n\nCongratulations on finding the strength and courage to rid your life of his toxic presence.

            "Sounds like my BF. It\u2019s classic NPD behavior. It\u2019s abusive. Nothing less. It hurts now, but be thankful you dodge a bullet. It\u2019s progressive behavior and would not stop. I\u2019m in the same boat now. Should probably take my own advice. I feel for you. ",
            "This guy was toxic and manipulative and you were right to break up with him. \n\nI will say though, hanging out with a guy you hooked up with, even if it was in high school and he's now with your best friend and she's there, and you hid it from him, is still messed up if it makes him uncomfortable/upset. I think this goes both ways though, regardless of gender, it's not just a guy thing, it's more person-to-person, some people simply don't care about you being around an ex or old hook up, while others freak out. There may be more to it but you can't really fault a person for it IMO. This doesn't excuse him texting his ex though, especially if he started it just to get you mad, or any of the other twisted thing he did. ",
            "Well he was right about one thing and one thing only: seeing a therapist wouldn't be the worst idea! If it's possible (time and finances wise) it might be good to unload all the shit that's built up over the last 18 months dating this broken POS. \n\nHaving said that, you've already made progress by finally admitting that he was a lot worse than you were telling yourself and breaking free from his grip. Just make sure you keep your wits about you and don't fall into the same trap with the next relationship. ",
            "dang, first congrats on having the strength to leave a relationship like that, sometimes we get caught up on the feelings and the neediness to be with someone that it clouds or judgement about what a real relationship should be like, and that often conflicts us and leaves in a place where you either jump or stay in something shitty.  \nGood for you for jumping, take some time to do YOU. Learn something new, pick up a hobby, do something for YOU.  \nTime will heal eventually of course, and it's okay to grieve a relationship, but at least you're smart to know what you deserve/need.  \nGood luck OP, and have some fun, enjoy life!",

You definitely did the right thing. Please don't delete yiur posts or save a private copy in case you start doubting you decision later. Sometimes we look back and wonder \"Was it really that bad? Was I overreacting?\" Here is your answer.",
            "Wow, it sounds like you dated my ex! It was the exact mind games and manipulation. All of the \u201cit\u2019s your fault I\u2019m like this\u201d bull. **The insanity didn\u2019t stop after we broke up, either, so stay strong!** I remember in a desperate attempt to get me to come back, he sent an email with a fking Brietbart article about how there is going to be a civil war so I better leave the country with him and move back overseas where we met.\n\nNope. At that point I was just so beyond done. I invite you to read about it if you like in my \u201csubmitted\u201d posts to this sub. I never even cried once since the official breakup (I mean I have cried that it didn\u2019t end sooner, but never cause it ended!). **I cried so much during the relationship that I had no tears left at the end I suppose.**\n\nIt\u2019s funny because my ex always said that \u201cI was going to leave him so he should just end it now\u201d whenever I did something he didn\u2019t like. A part of me thinks he said that because he wanted to be right when I finally did leave...\n\n**Well good effing riddance.** I now currently live with my new bf and we have two cats and I have never been in such a healthy place overall. ***Keep sticking up for yourself, better times are ahead.***",
            "It's better to be single than to be in a toxic relationship. And calling this guy toxic is kind of an understatement. \nCheers, amiga, and congratulations! Now you are free to begin moving upward and I can tell you from experience that this has the potential to be beyond amazing. ",
            "\"Before he left, he told me he really hoped I would see a therapist, because I needed help.\"\n\n\nUghhhh that is a classic abuser technique to make you feel like you are the problem, and that you're crazy, not him. What a piece of work. Stay strong, and when you miss him remember that smile when you told him how much you cried.",

Thank you, in behalf of every woman that has gone thru something like that, for sticking to your guns.\n\nAnd I agree with what has been said that you are grieving for the relationship you wanted, and will add that you are also grieving for the future you envisioned.

            "I'm so glad you got out! I was in a relationship like yours, a bit more subtle but just like that. But when it started I was 17 and didn't know abuse could look like that and got stuck for years. When I finally left he pretended to be drunk ( so I wouldn't press charges later), raped me and tried to kidnap the kids.\n\n You had an unbendable spine and knowledge of your own worth and I'm so fucking happy. Thank goodness. You should be really proud of yourself for standing your ground, it's not easy to walk away from someone you care about but you 1000000% did the right thing.",
            "You 100% did the right thing. I am guilty of being insecure and at times feeling down whenever my girlfriend has fun without me, but I would never make her feel guilty about doing those things, because she deserves to have her own decisions and her own life. I try my damn hardest to fight those insecurities everyday and be content with the fact that she does love spending time with me on a regular basis and we have a great time together always. I hope you will someday find that someone who truly loves you for the person you are, and allows you to be happy without having to feel like every part of your life is in their control.",
            "Oh boy. He sounds a bit like my ex. \n\nGET OUT OF THERE. You are worth so much more than this. You do not need to be told how to live your life and if a guy is making you cry/ giving you anxiety then he is not worth it. You need more. You are worth more. \n\nDo not let him bring you down.",
            "Wow, he did all that, even finding satisfaction of seeing/hearing you being upset and still had the audacity to recommend you to see a therapist? Jeez, you 110% did the right thing, because that guy needs help",
            "You're entirely wrong in this situation. It all stems from you inviting over a guy that you hooked up with. Then you hid it from him. That's going to be at the back of his mind bc essentially you betrayed him. You hid it bc you knew it wasn't right and there was a history there. That's incredibly disrespectful to your bf. I would be upset too.\n\nHow would you like it if he invited over his ex gf without telling you? And he intentionally hid it from you. That'd be messed up.\n\nThen you gaslit him to make him out to be the bad guy.\n\nYou are the problem. You don't need to be in a relationship. There are certain dos and donts in a relationship and you overstepped that boundary without thought. It's not that anything happened when you invited that person over, it's the thought. \n\nI just can't believe you thought that was okay. Luckily you broke up with him. After as bad as you disrespected him and have treated him, he is lucky to not be with you anymore. \n\nHave a little class. Being in a relationship changes things. You have to consider other people's feelings. Clearly you are not capable. You're heartless. \n\nEdit: All he wanted was for you to apologize for that friend coming over (that you slept with) and hiding it. Instead, you gaslight him and tell him he's controlling and get mad at him. You messed up and did something crappy and then make him pay for being mad. Take responsibility. ",

I\u2019m so happy to hear that you broke up with him, and I\u2019m proud of you (and you should be proud of yourself!). I\u2019m sure it was really difficult to pull the trigger and actually break up with him, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re hurting right now, but just know and trust that *it does get better*. \n\nYou\u2019re 24. You have the best years of your life ahead of you, and you don\u2019t need to waste them on someone who brings you down, criticizes you and makes you feel bad about yourself. One day, you\u2019ll meet a man that truly loves you, wants the best for you and makes you feel like the most special and important woman in the world. Remember that, stay strong, and don\u2019t take your toxic, loser ex back. ",
            "Were you the girl that her boyfriend wanted to change her hair color because he was obsessed with his ex?",
            "OP, you will eventually need to seek counseling. After being in a toxic relationship, it will get worse before it gets better. You will have set backs, you may even  possibly try to reconnect with your ex but remember there is a reason you guys are a closed chapter. This life is so damn short, there is no reason to be anything but happy. You will be in a good amount of pain for awhile but time does heal all wounds, maybe not completely but you will learn that time is your friend and not your enemy. Do things for you, go buy ice cream, watch a funny movie, do anything that you enjoy doing. \n\nIn the long run, people who treat you like you are the only problem in the relationship and don\u2019t take responsibility for their mistakes are not worth your energy. You will find someone who understands your flaws and not use them against you. Stay strong. ",
            "I just broke up with my boyfriend two weeks ago. I\u2019m still hurting. I loved him. But it needed to be done. I\u2019m just as proud of you as I am for myself for having to make that difficult decision.",
            "Go on and make an amazing future for yourself without the emotional baggage. It sucks, it hurts, but you'll see it soon enough that you deserved better. He didn't love you as much as he loved having the \"power\" to make you feel like shit. So let him be and you do you to get through this. Don't contact him or reply to him if he reaches out because he will. He's not worth it. At all. He found his self-worth to mean more than your actually relationship, as mentioned in his parting words. He only made a show to talk himself up because deflecting the break up and blaming you was easier than accepting how much of an emotional piece of crap he is. Maybe he knows, maybe he doesn't, but he knew what he was doing to hurt your feelings, so don't believe anything he has to say now. He's said and done what he wanted to hurt you, so don't let him hurt you anymore.",

            "Good on you. I know it's hard but you'll feel so much better even sooner than you expect. I dated a guy just like this in college and after I broke up with him he started sending me messages about his feeling suicidal. He very well may have felt that way, but I know there was a chance he was lying and only trying to manipulate me. Just wanted to warn you that this may be a possibility in case your ex tries to pull something similar.",
            "I am so glad you ended the relationship. You deserve better. I was in a similar relationship and stayed with him way too long.

            "Well done! Good for you for taking control of your life and deciding the direction you want to go. It's going to be tough for a little while, but as trite as it sounds, time heals all wounds. I guarantee you'll look back on this relationship one day and be SO damn happy you got out when you did.

            "It sucks but you had to do it. I was in a similar situation and am ashamed to say that I acted just like he did towards my girlfriend. I knew what I was doing was wrong but wasn't willing to change and it didn't matter what she did. I said those exact same words too and nothing changed. Maybe he'll grow up but if he can't find it within himself to change knowing that he's hurting you then he certainly can't look past what happened in y'all's relationship and move on.",
            "> Before he left, he told me he really hoped I would see a therapist, because I needed help.\n\nWell, you learned who he is right there.\n\n> It should also be noted that I am the same user who wrote a relationships advice post about having a boyfriend who wanted me to change my hair color. \n\nI admit that seems pretty weird to me. I guess I could see an SO musing, \"I think your hair would look better/interesting in [x color].\" But beyond that is bizarre unless the SO wants to change their hair color of their own volition to suit the SO.",
            "that comment about you needing to see a therapist... that is NOT okay! my ex treated me like this. calling me bipolar and crap, really messed my view of relationships up . glad you're out of that relationship! ",

Seeing him cry filled me with such a deep since of grief that it made me realize that I a) never wanted to see him cry again and b) that the next wedding I wanted to go to with him was OURS. You deserve someone who feels the same way when they find out youve been crying - you deserve someone who never wants to think they're the reason you cry.

            "Yeah, reading your previous post, it's a good thing you broke up with him. \n\nHe's not a bad guy, he's just way too immature to be in the relationship right now. Age doesn't always define a persons experience, he doesn't seem like he has much experience in relationships at all so for all intents and purposes he is a child when it comes to thinking outside of his own perspective and being in a partnership. \n\nYou didn't lie to him about your friend coming over, you just held off on telling him and he punished you emotionally about it for a month. \n\nIf he wants to be in a relationship where both people are updating each other constantly and can never be with anyone they don't have approval from their SO about, then he needs to find someone younger or dumber as far as relationships go. \n\nI wish you all the best."
