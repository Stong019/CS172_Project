The issue turned into a fight, and it even got worse. She found out I had Lasik performed. I forgot to mention that in my last post. She found out and said \u201cThat was the cherry on top\u201d.  \nI told her that she was acting extremely superficial and we needed to take some time apart. She didn\u2019t even act hurt or upset. She seemed like this was what she wanted.\nI didn\u2019t find out until it was too late, but she took a picture of the photo while with my mother. She claimed she wanted to keep the photo as a keepsake. After we broke up decided to snoop a little and looked at her Facebook. Everything is on private, and only a few certain little posts are made visible. She posted my photo of me in HS and wrote \u201cLadies, it\u2019s never too late to cut your losses. Your future children will thank you for making the right choices in a partner\u201d\n\nThis completely floored me. This was a breach in my privacy and childhood. Public shame and admonishment was taken to the max. I called her up and my number was blocked. I sent her an email asking her to take it down. No reply. I called her parents and told them about the situation, and they said they couldn\u2019t see the post and I told them it could just be some privacy setting she has. I check again and now I am completely blocked. \n\nIt just shocks me how she can go to this level of shaming, when I did nothing to her. It freaked her out that our children would have glasses and braces.  I have been pretty good moving on.\nGood news is I saved a lot of money on a ring.\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: We broke up, but not before some public shaming went down. sorry this was momentarily deleted for no TL;dr",

Braces are SO COMMON in kids today, and would have been in previous generations if they were more accessible. I know more people who had braces or aligners than did not. The same is true of acne, more kids have access to dermatologists to treat the symptoms. That's not lying about your looks, it's treating incredibly common medical conditions. You're a successful, attractive person, and though you may not be used to feeling like that, you are, and you don't have to settle for shit. \n\nMost women I know went through an awkward ugly duckling stage, I don't think I'd waste time on anyone who used by freshman yearbook picture as a barometer for my genetic suitability as a mate.

            "I was an \"ugly duckling\" too. I was a chubby kid, bad teeth, way-too-long hair (my mom wouldn't let me cut it; she said it was too pretty, but the pictures tell a different story). Just a fucking mess. High school years weren't too great, either. I got braces, lost weight/got fit and kind of came into my own after that. I wouldn't say I'm \"hot,\" but I'm conventionally attractive. \n\nI knew my husband for a decade before we started dating. He knew me during the awkward-as-shit high school years. He's seen the terrible childhood photos. He thinks I'm hot and tells me so all the time. I tease him, \"Did you think I was hot in high school?\" He says he did (says he had a crush on me but was too shy to ask me out). I tell him that's how I know he really loves me -- he thinks I'm so awesome that he's literally blinded by love.\n\nThis girl sounds like a total fucking nightmare. I think the FB post is her being bitter because she got dumped. I cannot believe people like her exist. It's super cliche, but you dodged a bullet. Just be glad she showed her true colors before you bought her a ring.\n\nAlso, any normal, sane girl would see the old picture and think it's cute. My MIL has childhood photos of my husband up all over the house. He looks super goofy in some of them. I giggle at the adorableness every time I see them. I also found his freshman year of h.s. ID and he looks like a baby; it's a super awkward pic and I love it because I love him. Her reaction was not normal.",

            "Just wait until she sees what pregnancy is going to do to HER body.",
            "I'm sorry you had this experience, but I feel even sorrier for your ex. How little she must value herself (aside from her own looks) and her own potential if she can dismiss another person so easily for falling short of perfection. She must walk around in a constant state of self-criticism. \"Should I eat this cookie? I'll look so fat. I'm so tired but I have to wear make up today, or else I'll look awful.\" You may never have heard her voice these criticisms, but I can tell you that judgmental people judge themselves the hardest. \n\nI grew up in a very judgmental family. The genetic purity insanity she's spouting sounds similar to things my parents said to me about people I dated, except in terms of intelligence. They meant well, trying raise me as a confident young woman and guide me to equally smart, confident partners. Ironically, that upbringing did a whammy on my confidence-- anytime I made a mistake or wasn't the smartest person in the room, I thought I was a failure. By teaching me to write off anyone I deemed less than perfect, my parents had taught me how to write off myself if I ever wobbled on the impossibly thin tightrope of perfection I'd stretched out for myself.\n\nYour ex's upbringing doesn't excuse her poor behavior, nor can I tell if her upbringing is a direct cause. But you're certainly better off not investing your time in someone who fosters so much hate and so little faith and empathy.\n\nFor myself-- getting out from underneath my parents' roof helped a lot. During/after undergrad, I dated a \"perfect\" guy like my father: confident, intelligent, ambitious. But he left me emotionally cold. He thought my interest in the humanities was a waste of time, and my desire to help people \"cute,\" a charming trait that proved I was a soft, silly girl, someone who needed protecting. I left him and separated myself from all our mutual friends who were similarly situated (they had all landed jobs at a prominent software company straight out of college, had cars, condos, etc). I quit my well-paid, soul-sucking receptionist gig at the aforementioned company and started working part-time at a farmer's market and a test prep company. I struggled financially (did the food stamp thing for a while) but I loved the strange, genuine people I met at the market. I also loved my students. I discovered that sharing empathy, openness, and vulnerability with other people brought me far more joy than a mask of superiority and self-sufficiency.\n\nI'm almost 30 now, and still struggling financially (lol... college adjuncting is not a lucrative gig) but I'm the happiest I've ever been. I adore teaching and my students. I've been in therapy for a little over a year, learning how to love, forgive, and believe in myself after a stint of unemployment, anxiety, and depression following grad school. I just got married to a man I absolutely cherish. Sometimes he reminds me of the guy I dated before-- they're both smart, ambitious, nerdy. But my husband is decidedly \"imperfect.\" His passion for his ideals often offends people (and me). His rare ability to understand when he's wrong and revise his opinions can come off as wishy-washy or dumb because he often changes his ideas mid-argument. He drops food everywhere and forgets to shave and can't plan ahead for shit. But he believes in me and supports me, even when it's terrifying to do so. \n\nWhat if I had never gotten a job and crippled our financial future? What if I stayed depressed forever, or hurt myself? Finding out that someone you love is mentally ill, broke, and a mess is a lot more damning than finding out they use to have pimples and braces. And yet he was able to see past those outward expressions of turmoil and into the person I was/am-- someone who's trying to figure life out, but who is still worthy of love and trust. And it's not like my husband hasn't shaken my faith in him at times, either. But if you want to make a life with someone long-term, you work through those little earthquakes, knowing that the ground might shake and look torn after, but is still a solid thing you can walk on 99% of the time.\n\nYou deserve a relationship like this. Everyone does, even your ex-- although I can't argue that she'll change her outlook like I have. I hope looking forward to the opportunity for something better eases the loss of this relationship.

I am biracial (so while my hair is gorgeous NOW no one knew how to take care of it when I was little) I had cystic acne by age 8, had to get braces for my crazily crooked teeth, and had coke-bottle glasses. I looked a mess. Sometimes shit just happens. My dad barely had anything \"wrong\" with him either so I was uh...just lucky and had a rough very long puberty. What parent would tell their kid that they are ugly are aren't good enough? Someone like her. You dodged a bullet.",

You guys have dated for 2 years and if looks are what makes or breaks your relationship you are clearly doing it wrong. Yeah she is superficial but if this is what it takes to make you notice you are either A.) just as superficial or B.) to dumb(or clueless) to notice how shallow your ex was. So as much as she should live in a garbage can. You should also really work on yourself and learn that looks aren't everything. Yeah you were ugly before and you went thru a lot to fix it.

It's not shallow to find somebody attractive that you want to be with or to want to look nice yourself. What is shallow AF is when you judge a persons entire genetics and the future outcome of your relationship on what they looked like in their awkward teen years.

I am more stylish now, but what if my boyfriend sees a picture of me in JNCO jeans in 9th grade?? It is absolutely absurd that anyone would  act the way your ex did. Absurd. I like to joke about how I was an ugly duckling and that guys who used to make fun of me and bully me in high school will now ask me out on dates.\n\nGlad she is ex now, YOUR future children will thank you.\n\nWow what if she has a child with a disability? Even good teeth isn't genetic, my mom was a bombshell (and my dad was attractive) but I still had fucked up teeth and was awkward. I feel bad for any kids she will have that might not live up to her absurd ideals. She sounds like the Kim Kardashian here, not you.\n\nI am so sorry you went through this though.

She is a nasty person who will hopefully figure out that no one likes superficial bitches. In the future, don't be afraid of what you looked like as a kid.

It was just you were not OK at that time.\n\nRegarding your \"genetics\" the fact that you look great now is a testament of the person you always was. You just had the bad luck to have limited options during your upbringing due to your mother raising you on her own and other issues we don't know. But you corrected that. And you polished that diamond now. Good to you!\n\nAbout the LASIK procedure, so what? Eye issues are part of human DNA so to an extent none of us are free from that and she can't know the level of your \"original\" sight. I was literally blind but now I have  20/20 sight that I was not born with. So what?\n\nCheers and congrats. You dodged a bullet matrix style.

What happens if her kids just get the bad genes?  Even if they don't, they're going to have a mother who will instill in them a certainty that their looks are the most important thing they can offer the world.  Her poor daughters will never have a healthy self-image, probably never have a healthy relationship with food and I really pity her sons as they go through their awkward teenage years.\n\nShit, this woman is a nightmare waiting to happen, and regardless of her future children's outward physical beauty, they are going to be extremely emotionally damaged.",

Thank you for the gold. \n\n\nEdit 2: I guess I should clarify that Nita and I are not out of friends completely, and that the comments our other 'friends' were making all the time wasn't friendly advice to prepare ourselfves in case something went wrong. Some of them heard 'pre-eclampsia' and decided either my gf or my baby would die, or I'd certainly lose them both. I freaked out, even with our doctor's words ringing through my mind that Nita was fine. It was brutal to consider the possibility I could lose my girls, especially when there was no need to consider that. Then, when things were over, the same people who were so sure of death were suddenly sure that my gf and baby would pull through no matter what. That hurt and pissed me off, not to mention how much it hurt Nita who didn't need to go through any more stress. \n\n---\nI guess the reason I was freaking out so much in my last post was because I knew something was going to happen.\n\nNah, I'm kidding, I was just freaking out. But 4 days after that post, Nita's water broke. She didn't even need to be induced, our baby just decided she wanted out already. We were tense and scared but everything went well and now we're the parents of a healthy baby girl. Nita's health is also good and her mood has improved drastically because she can finally let go of that bed rest rule.\n\nOur baby is sweet and tiny and loud and holding her for the first time was the most amazing thing I have ever experienced. We've been adjusting to parenthood ever since and it's been great. Baby cries a lot and I know the crying will eventually drive us a little crazy, but for now I'm just happy my baby has lungs strong enough to wake up the entire neighbourhood.\n\nA few of our ''friends'' have called, wanting to check up on Nita and the baby. One of them told me they just knew everything would be alright, and I couldn't help myself then and said that his previous words to me on Nita's pregnancy had been: 'shit, man, you gotta be strong 'cause this is probably gonna end badly'. I told him to fuck off and leave me and my girls alone.\n\nSo, this is it, I guess. I wanted to update because you guys were really good to us, and calmed us down. I'm sorry I couldn't reply to everyone back then, but I appreciate all the advice and responses. You guys shared yours stories with us, and it meant a lot, be sure of that.\n\ntl;dr: Turns out I was freaking out for no reason. My girls are strong as hell and are doing more than fine. Thanks for the help, everyone.",

So, when she's 2, obsessed with elephants, goes into pure panic upon seeing an insect, has no interest in any food other that crackers...yeah that will pass. \n\n3.)

Hope I'm formatting it right.\n\nAfter making the original post, I couldn't get the situation off my mind - it was driving me nuts and really just stressing me out. I talked it over with my mom, and asked my aunt to send me some pics of 'Andy'. She asked why, and I told her that I wanted to compare them to the painting of him she'd started.\n\nSo I acquired the pictures, then did a reverse image search as many of you suggested. Thank goodness she sent me more than one picture of the guy, because only the last one got a hit, but from there, it was smooth sailing. Turns out the REAL guy is a poplar instagram model. He's got info about him being a Marine, and having a dog with the same name as Andy's dog right in his bio. This dude was so lazy he just lifted the real man's basic info.\n\nThe DOG even has an instagram, and I found more photos Andy sent to her. And to make my life even easier, the real guy has a series of videos up in his Highlights section labeled 'SCAMMERS'. I watched them and basically it was him addressing what to do if someone is being catfished with his pics. I was super nervous, but confident I had what I needed.\n\nSo from there, I slept on it, and then asked my aunt if I could come visit. My mom helped me stay calm beforehand, and the worst part leading up to it was standing in their house saying hello and just waiting to drop the bomb.\n\nI started off with saying 'there's actually a reason i'm here. I have something to tell you, and you won't like it.'\n\nI explained my motives for getting Andy's pics, the reverse image search, and finding the real guy. I pulled up his profile, and the dog's, and let her scroll through it while answering questions she and my grandma had. She tried to call Andy, text him, and just...it was weird guys. She used the phrase \"I'll go psycho on his ass\" in several variants. She never struck me as that type of person, but she was just blowing him up, and of course, when she FINALLY got ahold of him, and asked him to explain what I'd found. ugh, his voice. She had him on speakerphone.\n\n\"Baby, what you saying?\" (this was basically his answer to everything she said.)\n\n\"Baby, we don't need this. You just gotta trust.\"\n\nI wanted to grab the phone and tell him to cut his crap, but didn't. I stayed a couple more hours, answering questions, trying to console her. Apparently they'd actually been talking for like...two years? I'm torn on whether or not to believe that, bc as much as I love my aunt, i know from experience she can bend the truth to fit delusions sometimes. Anyways.\n\nMy grandma, who was there the whole time, was being her usual brusque self, so I pulled her aside and tried to explain that this wasn't the time for tough love, but for the band-aid-and-kisses type of motherly support. She agreed, and thanked me, saying that she's been seeing my aunt 'change', but she didn't say how. After we went back into the main room, she was trying to be a little more sensitive, but it doesn't come naturally to her.\n\nFrom there, I needed to go to work and take care of something before the work day ended.\n\nSince then, unfortunately, it seems that despite my warnings that she would not get anything that could be guaranteed as the truth out of Andy, she insisted on 'demanding explanations' and now he's got her convinced that everything they had was real, and that a friend had dared him into the deception. So now, according to her, \"they are talking, and there's a lot of trust to rebuild.\"\n\nI'm saddened by the turn of events, but I did my job, and she's an adult who has to make her own choices. I'm trying to let go of the outcome, which obviously wasn't he one I hoped for, and to not feel hurt. I know she's going through a lot emotionally, and that it was silly to hope my intervention would change things. Hopefully, she'll see the truth of it sooner rather than later, and I can have played a part in that.\n\nTl;dr: I found the instagram of the real guy that Andy was stealing pics from, and took the information to my aunt to tell her she was being catfished. She cried, asked questions, I comforted for a few hours then left, advising her to cut off contact with him. Unfortunately she didn't, since then, he's told her 'it was a dare' and they are 'talking and rebuilding trust.'",

            "Good on you for telling her, which had to be a hard experience. What she does now or continues to do is up to her. ",
            "It is very difficult to convince someone that they are completely wrong in this situation. I lost my father to a Nigerian dating scam - he met her on Facebook and had never heard of dating scams. He actually went to Nigeria and married her. Because there was a real person in Lagos who matched the photo, it was impossible to convince him that it was still a scam. Last I heard, he was paying her living expenses to move to \u201ca nicer part of Lagos\u201d with the date of her moving to join him in the US always pushed out farther. \n\nShe primed him to expect resistance from me by feeding him a star-crossed lovers story, so when I expressed skepticism upon hearing that he was 1) going to Nigeria on Tuesday in 3 days, and 2) involved with a Nigerian woman who he only knew through a random friend request, who is younger than I am and a truly wild background story (she used to be Jewish, but not anymore?! And she runs a nonprofit called Girls Nonprofit, and she has a masters degree from University....) it fed the romantic story she had built for him. \n\nThe really sad thing is that I would have been thrilled to hear he was in an actual relationship, had encouraged him to sign up on dating websites for years, and don\u2019t really care about age discrepancies over the age of 40. I couldn\u2019t deal with the lying and him sneaking off to Lagos after telling me he wouldn\u2019t go, posting wedding pictures on Facebook. I never thought he was this sort of person. ",
            "Ultimately, you're right. You can only arm her with information what she chooses to do and who she chooses to believe is on her. \n\nI do wonder about finances. Does your grandmother have shared accounts with your aunt that this \"Andy\" could access through your Aunt? IANAL or within the finance world but \nIt  might be worth talking to some family members about ensuring she doesn't have access to grandma's finances etc. It's horrible enough whats going on I'd hate to see anyone caught up in this mess. \n\nBest of luck and for what it's worth i think you did a great (and brave!) Thing in getting to the bottom of this scam and giving her information, hopefully she can see the light and find peace and break away from this scammer. ",
            "Your aunt is lucky to have you for a niece. \n\n\nUnlucky that her judgment is so terrible, but.... you've done all you can do.  Let's hope you helped her avoid the worst. ",
            "This is exactly what I expected when reading the original post, I just can't believe your Aunt let the guy con her into continuing this \"relationship\". ",
            "Yes, as a woman in that exact age bracket, we are catfish catnip, so to speak. I got the \"hot guy with cute dog\" catfish, the Army general catfish, the overseas deployed military catfish, the undercover cop/private detective catfish... All of them. \n\nI feel for your aunt. The need for companionship is great and loneliness is terrible. At the end of the day, we have to use our common sense. The most basic lesson...if it seems to good to be true, it is. ",
            "As someone who works in credit card fraud. \nIf she\u2019s buying gift cards to send this person and giving them money she will be responsible for this money.  Few, if any card companies, will take charges authorized by the cardholder as fraudulent charges, regardless whether or not they are scam victims.\n\nAs shitty as it is to put this in front of someone and have them throw it in your face, I think you should try again.  If only because you know this will eventually blow up in her face, and not only will she be stuck with a broken heart, but a mountain of debt as well. \n\nI realize at a certain point there\u2019s just no talking to some people, and I hope you haven\u2019t reached that point for her sake. ",
            "It is not really much that you can do. You did your part, you exposed him, and from here it is up to your aunt to handle things. If you can, watch out if he asks her to send money. I am not sure, but maybe you can contact police and prevent her from becoming a link in possible illegal activities (money laundering for example). I read your first post and hoped this will turn out fine. Somehow, I was expecting this to happen. There are a lot of videos on youtube of women who got catfished and then scammed, I hope your aunt won't be one of them, but this is the reason I am telling you to be careful with her sending/receiving money. I wish you all the best.",

            "Report his profile on Instagram, it\u2019ll be shut down fairly quick.  And/or send the fake profile to the real Andy and he can report it.\n\nI get them ALL the time. Usually it\u2019s a widowed military guy with a kid.\n\nIt seems that once they think they have their hooks in you, they\u2019ll bombard you with 20 other similar profiles after you report/block them, all with same or very similar stories.  Most of them are dumb enough when using military pictures to leave the real person\u2019s name tag in the picture- another way to either 1. Verify it isn\u2019t actually the guy (if the names don\u2019t match) 2. Find the real person\u2019s profile.\n\nMaybe you can catfish the cat fisher?",

            "Can you get your aunt watch several of Dr. Phil episodes on this ? \nHe takes this subject on often and has seen every angle.

I commend you on your tender heart and effort so far.  ",
            "Ive learned that some people would rather hold on to a little bit of nothing, nothing but hope, than be alone. They'll stay in the worst \"relationships\". They will seem completely delusional. They'll blatantly ignore every sign than go back to being lonely. I used to think that deep inside they knew and they were playing along. But its like they hypnotize themselves into believing it. I've found the best way to snap them out is to pretend you believe it too. But drop little hints like maybe hes not the best boyfriend. Say things like Oh you sent Andy a card? What did he send you? Oh nothing that's weird? Just act like you believe and support her and drop hints for her to come to her own conclusion. Its weird but it works everytime.",

            "Your aunt sound like she is addicted to the high of being in love and feeling loved. So like any addict she has a hard time relinguishing the drug, and he is the supply. Its not real, but it feels real to her, and if she doesnt scrutinise it too much, its a real source of connection and human closeness. Or atleast it mimics those emotions and that feeling so much so she doesnt want to let it go. Maybe she doesnt believe she could replace it with the real thing. I dont know why someone would stay in such an illusion, but maybe she was lonely.\n\nShe might get there with time, but it depends on how much she needs the escape from her actual life.\n",

There was only one possible outcome here, and I think you handled it very tactfully.\n\nIf you wanted to take things further, I would not be surprised if the producers of Catfish took on your case. But that of course would come at the cost of invading everyone's privacy, so perhaps it's better to step back, for now, and hope it'll fizzle out with the seed of doubt that you planted.",

Just be ready to be there for her when she falls and hope that she learns from it and doesn\u2019t repeat the same mistakes. All that aside, it is a bit ironic that she is also catfishing him by sending highly edited pics that look nothing like her. Even if she is attracted to the \u201creal deal\u201d, he may not feel the same. And thats assuming this isnt ALL about money, but sadly it probably is. Sorry OP.

If my friend were a close relative, I would probably try to get some kind of court mandated control over her finances.  Because there is likely a lot going on here that your family doesn\u2019t know about.

            "This happened to a co-worker of mine. She found out the guy stationed in Germany was actually from Nigeria. She broke off communication briefly but eventually returned to messaging again and then flew out to marry him. I think it's hard to fully break off that connection, since they really feel something and don't want to throw it away on a \"little thing\" like false pictures. It's sad, because lack of self-confidence really feeds into that insecurity and convinces them to hold onto what they can get, even if they're being scammed or cat-fished. Warn her against paying for his things and buying him too much, OP. That's honestly the best you can do since, like you said, she's an adult and makes her own decisions.",

It\u2019s a feature length film about HIS personal catfish story that happened to him and his story ended up going much deeper than the simple bait and switch. It\u2019s a long way down that rabbit hole but it beautifully showcases how people online, especially lonely or mentally unstable people get very desperate and get sucked in very fast. Desperation can lead what would otherwise typically be rational and intelligent people to do desperate things. Vulnerable people get sucked in too, loneliness can eat away at people so much that I think they would sometimes rather just live with the lies because in this fantasy they have build is comfort, in this fantasy they are safe. But Nev\u2019s story really showcases how far left things can go and how before you know you are baring your very soul to a complete and utter stranger who you feel like you know - even if you feel like you do.

It\u2019s advice that is trotted out in every relationship forum as the gold standard of relationship evolution, talk it out, find out why, and everyone deserves a chance .

I feel like this is a drama producing shitpost, mining for ideas, but if its not, op, tell your aunt in no uncertain terms that what she thinks she has is such a pale comparison to something good, and face to face matters more than anything.

But last night, he comes out like this- \u201cBabe, I need to tell you something. I\u2019ve been texting with her every day\u201d then proceeds to tell me she\u2019s basically been gossiping and talking about random stuff to him. The way he said it sounded borderline confession-y imo. He started getting defensive and acting weird. I didn\u2019t say anything to trigger that really, I just said \u201cyou know it\u2019s interesting that you guys talk to eachother\u2019s wives/girlfriends\u201d(in a nice tone.)He goes \u201cwhat do you mean by INTERESTING?!?!!\u201d And proceeded to grill me and accuse me of being insecure over it. I said \u201clet me make myself clear, I\u2019m fine with you talking to her, text her as much as you want babe.\u201d But his whole vibe continued to be off.\n\n\nI wasn\u2019t suspicious but now I\u2019m starting to be. This isn\u2019t the first time there\u2019s been an issue with him excessively texting another girl all the time. I want to trust him but his behavior/attitude is making me uneasy.

I can think of 99 ways that\u2019ll backfire on me\n\nEdit again: side detail- he asked me if I would be OK with my friends texting him. I told him I would not be comfortable with that. I told him if it works for some other women in their relationships, then that\u2019s great and I respect that. But he should also respect that I would not like it if my friends texted him constantly. He proceeded to get heated and try to convince me that I\u2019m wrong. I told him his vigor on the topic was bizarre because he\u2019s never even met my friends and maybe i would re-evaluate when the time came.",

Nothing about their \"friendship\" is acceptable -- he refuses to listen respectfully to your concerns, he doesn't recognize any boundaries, and she's not a friend to your relationship. \n\nThe next time he texts in your presence, ask to see the phone.   If he tries to claim some sort of \"privacy\", tell him privacy is not a shield to conduct a secret relationship.  Do not argue with him about seeing the messages.  If he refuses, just get up and leave.  f he allows you to see them, read the out loud.   Don't comment or let him \"explain\", just keep reading and let him squirm.

It is also essential in a relationship to offer security to the other person. If you are feeling insecure, that's what the other part was supposed to do. If they can't do that, it's not gonna be a healthy relationship.",
            "Everything hes doing is classic cheater behavior. No one should be scared of their SO seeing their texts. in every situation I've been in where they are so adamant about hiding their texts, they were cheating in some way. The best part? The projecting that something is wrong with you is also classic behavior, right down to making it seem like you're crazy or would be crazy for reaching out, and you're falling for it honey, hook, line and sinker. Demand to see the texts. Hes gonna pull the \"its innocent and youre crazy for looking!\" Your response should be show me the texts or I'm leaving. If he still refuses, he just answered your question for you. Honest men dont behave this way. You have every right to see his messages ESPECIALLY when hes texting another woman constantly! Even if it actually did make you crazy, who cares? I dont know about you, but I'd rather be crazy than stupid.",
            "Hey OP, I think you've gotten some great advice on how to potentially handle this situation, so I want to address something else that's worrisome about this to me.\n\nThrough your post and responses I'm seeing that you're in a very new relationship with a man who has betrayed your trust with at least one woman you know of already, and you're trying to convince yourself that against all evidence he's not doing the same thing again. \n\nWhy? The relationship isn't even 1 year old yet. You're in early stage of the relationship where 2 things are supposed to be happening:\n\n1. The honeymoon stage. You're both putting forth your very best selves and are intoxicated by each other.\n2. The evaluation stage. You're paying close attention to who the other person is, what they do and believe, and determining if they are compatible with your vision of your future. \n\nSo we know this about your boyfriend. Cheating on you (it's happened at least once, almost certainly more) is what this guy does when he's on his best behavior. Also being controlling and jealous (making you take pictures to prove you're not cheating, a classic move of projection from cheaters) is him at the very top of his game. \n\nWe know this about you. You see him do all of these disrespectful, repugnant things to you and by continuing to date him you're evaluating that these are compatible with the type of partner you want. Why is that? Why do you consent to letting romantic partners treat you poorly? Why do you think you deserve that? Where is that coming from?\n\nFor your own sake, I hope you schedule an appointment soon with a counselor of some kind. Staying with any jerk who gives you compliment is self-destructive, and if this isn't nipped in the bud soon, you could lose yourself completely to people who were never worth or even appreciate your time. You only live once. Don't waste your love on people who don't treat you at least as well as you treat them.",

Occasionally, she\u2019ll tell me to text them something, but it still feels odd. \n\nI basically have one or two long-time female friends that I text - on occasion. But not non-stop. I would show my wife my texts to them (or anybody for that matter) if she ever asked. \n\nLet me just say, I used to be married to another woman. There was a point in time where she was texting non-stop to a personal trainer of hers. One weekend, when I was out of town, she had sent pictures of herself in her underwear to him. \n\nLong story short, I found out... after my spider senses were tingling, I snooped in her phone one evening after she was out late into the early morning hours. What I found was disturbing... the pics, and the texts. I don\u2019t believe they hooked up that night, but they definitely wanted to. \n\nAt that point, I confronted her. I straight up told her I wasn\u2019t comfortable with the relationship she was having with him. She could either stop, or we could get divorced, and she could see and talk to him as much as she wanted. \n\nShe didn\u2019t like that at all \u201cbut, I\u2019m losing so much weight with all my workouts... he encourages me... he\u2019s good for me.\u201d\n\nI \u201ccompromised\u201d and said she could keep seeing him for workouts, but the texting stops. I wasn\u2019t comfortable with the arrangement. But, the agreement was made. \n\nNot less than I week later, I found her phone again, after some spider tingling. She was no longer messaging him on the messenger app, she had moved to WhatsApp, because their conversations could be more secret. Sure enough, there were tons and tons of texts back and forth. \n\nI told her that afternoon, she needed to pack her things and leave. She did. She moved into her friend\u2019s house. We tried some emergency counseling, but she couldn\u2019t not stop talking to the guy. I said fuck this, and filed for divorce a month later. \n\nThat was almost 5 years ago. I\u2019m remarried, to someone I completely trust that loves me more than I\u2019ve ever felt loved before, and that I love like I have never loved before. \n\nThis guy has issues. Anyone that constantly has the need to always be texting *anyone* probably has some issues. For the love of God, how do you get anything done - even if you\u2019re just gossiping back and forth. That\u2019s no way to live, and it\u2019s such an injustice to the people in your life that you are around all the time (like your significant others). \n\nPut the fucking phone down and be present in your real life on occasion.",

There are many innocuous reasons and explanations he could give for the texting to go on, but there are far fewer reasons to grill someone and call them insecure. It sounds like he's projecting based on (a) how he thinks you would react or (b) how he thinks you should react.",
            "No way, that's not normal at all. You can tell everything by his confession-like way of telling you and him flipping out when you probe into the issue a tiny bit. He knows he's doing something he shouldn't be, that's why he seemed guilty when he told you. You should find a way to mention this to his friend, because I bet the friend doesn't know that all this has been going on either. Shouldn't his wife-to-be have other things to do than privately chat about god knows what to your bf all day long? Or maybe she naively thinks he's just trying to be friends. But he's very probably trying to do something else, since this isn't the first time he's been inappropriately in too much contact with other women.",

            "What he's doing COULD be totally fine. Or it could be not fine. However I'm not sure his reaction is the best gauge of that. In the general American society, I'd bet that most would claim it's not fine at all, even though it may in fact be not a problem. And that COULD be an explanation for his defensiveness, he was brought up (by society) that this is wrong and thus feels some guilt, also maybe he just doesn't know how to handle his feelings and express himself, sort of like when children hide something from their parents because they think they're gonna be in trouble, but in reality there's nothing wrong with what they did.  \n\n\nI would ask to see the messages. If he's says no, then there's an inherently sketchy action. You don't have any right to them, but given the circumstances, I think it's a very fair ask. Also, 7 months is NOT that long of a relationship and not long enough to have any level of certainty in someone.",
            "This is weird. I\u2019m sorry. Doesn\u2019t she have any single girlfriends she can text??",
            "You could also ask him how he feels about it. \"Are you feeling weird about her texting you all this gossip?\" \"Do you want to share this gossip with me?\"\n\nI mean, the admission-y vibe could have also been a sort of cry for help, like \"wtf am I getting myself into?\" It might not be flirty between them...yet. But he could be getting pulled into this woman's world of gossip and intrigue which is hard to resist for some.",
            "Did you ask him if he can do anything to help you feel less weird about this? \nIf he feels that you should better understand, he should contribute in making you understand. Involve more communication",
            "His reaction is a huge red flag. And the fact that this isn\u2019t the first time is also troubling. My ex husband used to the exact same thing and I let it go, thinking I was being jealous and unhealthy. I wish I would have gone with my gut and ended things early on. Instead I wasted nearly 6 years of my life with someone who ended up cheating on me. It started just the way you\u2019re describing. I\u2019m not saying your boyfriend is going to do that, but his behavior is concerning. Whatever the case, I suggest you trust your gut instinct on this. Really watch his actions and take note of things that seem off.",
            "It sounds to me like he's feeling its a little wrong but his intentions aren't. He mentioned it to you hoping your response would relieve him and when it didn't he got upset. Maybe he even perceived your response to not be \"okay\" only cuz he was expecting it to be bad. I hope I'm making sense.\n\nPersonally I don't get why they are talking so much. SHE isn't the school friend and I am curious if she would tell her fiance. Maybe her intentions in all this aren't so great and I would bring that up to him. Simply ask him if his friend knows they talk a lot cuz honestly if the friend doesn't know that's definitely weird. If your bf knows for sure the friend doesn't know just ask him how he'd feel if roles were reversed and you and one of his friends were texting a lot technically behind his back. What if the friend finds out and isn't okay with it and it backfires on their friendship...? He should tread carefully.",

Whenever I said I don't want her talking to him anymore she got all defensive and mad at me and kept saying about she couldn't do this anymore and sounding like she was going to leave me because I kept asking questions.

That revelation made my SO feel like the friendship was illicit and they stopped talking.  I agree with the people writing that if her fianc\u00e9 knows and is fine with it, and you\u2019re okay, then maybe it\u2019s okay. If her fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t know, then it\u2019s shady and perhaps there are some feelings/intentions to cheat.",

            "Idk if you'll see this considering there's 200+ comments, but I'll add my 2 cents anyway.\n\nHe asked to text her to congratulate her. Why could he not have done that in person or at the wedding? It sounds like he just used an excuse to get her number and start flirting via text with her. The fact that she is gossiping with him, means that she's starting to get/feel close with him and he's entertaining it. What is she gossiping about? Is he or she talking down about you? Or her fiance? Or the rest of the friend group? In this case they probably have some inside jokes and knowledge, which would make them even closer. I honestly see this as a big red flag. There's no reason their conversation should have gone past \"congrats\" and \"thanks\" but it did and now they're acting like little gossip buddies talking and planning who knows what.\n\nDoes he have a history with this woman? Does he have her on social media and if so do they talk alot, tag each other in stuff, constantly like each other pictures/posts? It seems like they're getting unnecessarily close. It also seems like he wants you to be upset about it and is gaslighting you into arguments about it. \n\"Hey I've been talking to this chick quite a lot lately\" \"oh okay that's nice\" \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU'RE BEING SO WEIRD ABOUT THIS WTF\" it honestly doesn't look good. I'm not usually one to suggest \"just dump them\" but in this case I am. It seems like he's going to do nothing but gaslight you, play mind games with you and potentially cheat on you and become a home wrecker.

            "So many red flags...\n\nEasy solution is to text his friend (the one of the girl he's texting a lot) and say you want to be text buddy the way your boyfriend and his girlfriend are doing.\n\nObviously,  do it in a manner where you mimic the behavior of your boyfriend and do it in the spirit of better understanding this new \"friendship \" and there you will see it all spill out from your boyfriend and his buddy knowing all the details of your boyfriend and the girl's blossoming \"friendship \"...\nThe reaction of your boyfriend and his friend will be most telling.\n\nIf your boyfriend can behave and do what he's doing then he should be fine with you doing it, too.\n\nSide note: dump him.

I have read like 3 comments and there was already one saying \"Get rid of him\", typical. \nMy opinion: If it were my bf, I would find it weird, because you don't text constantly if you're not thinking about the person constantly. He might be in love with her and is feeling guilty. \nI'd have an honest conversation with him, make clear what's at stake here and if that proves itself to be impossible, reconsider the entire relationship. Mostly because of his lack of mature communication skills and obvious inner conflict.\nWhen dating, one of the worst things is a partner who doesn't know what they want.\n\nFollow your heart, but do what's best for you.\n\nGood luck!",

            "He knows it's inappropriate - hence him trying to find the angle of how it should be okay. This is him trying to rationalize with himself that it's an innocent thing that he is doing. If he wasn't trying to find the angle, then really it would not be that big of a deal. Just talk to him and say that his behavior when confronted or during conversations regarding this topic is obtuse to how he typically behaves. This gives you reserve and causes you to be concerned that there might be something inappropriate happening - either it be by his own moral conflict or him enjoying the emotional flirtation or any other scenarios not here mentioned.

He started texting his friend\u2019s wife nonstop. \n\nIt took about two weeks for me to tell my ex to enjoy the crush he clearly had, but that if anything went further he would be breaking my trust.  A week after that he tried to get me to agree to being polyamorous. And a week after *that* he admitted that they\u2019d cuddled when he went to visit (before he talked to me at all) but he swore nothing else happened. \n\nHe then told me he felt his feelings for her were getting serious, and was all surprised-Pikachu-face when that was the last straw and I dumped him. Apparently he thought \u201cI\u2019m okay with you having a crush, but this is a new relationship and I don\u2019t want to introduce anything else so anything beyond enjoying talking to her is a violation of my boundaries\u201d meant \u201cI fully support you in anything you do!\u201d\n\nI was waaay too forgiving.

If, as time goes by, you find that you no longer feel you are compatible, then you have to decide what to do about that. I would just bear this in mind as a possible issue and add it to your overall understanding of who he is. It could be a phase. It could be innocent. It could not be.\n\nGood relationships have honesty, trust and respect at their core. Personally, I need to be able to discuss emotive topics openly, so I feel heard and understood.

I found out but chose to believe him and he acted just like your bf. \n\nIt happened a few more times over the years but I was just brushing it off and became more and more unhappy. We went through some difficult times together so stuck together. He ended up splitting up with me early last year and I was devastated at first, but after I moved in with a housemate, I swear it was the best thing that ever happened to me. He ended up becoming abusive and said some pretty disgusting things a few months ago through the social medias I am on and also sent me threats so I had to block him on everything. \n\nBut since then, I have never felt better.

I hope you can find the best solution to your problem and that you have a happy future.",
            "Just trust your gut! Clearly he has something to hide and if you cannot trust each other then there is no point in trying to continue the relationship. I wouldn't waste anymore time on this guy, especially with him trying to make you feel bad for the shit he is doing. Seems you have already gotten a few red flags already and this seems more than enough to open your eyes and get out of there. Good luck to you!",
            "I think the concerning/suspicious thing is the \"constantly\" adjective (which is subjective, but you should trust your gut). And his approach feeling like a confession and him getting hyper defensive about it, and it not being the first time he's done this, yeah, that's too much for a 7 month relationship (at least for a serious one, where you're looking for a life partner).",

Secondly, why are you texting your mates soon to be wife that much? And does the friend whose about to marry her know these things? Wonder how he feels. \n\nHe\u2019s gaslighting the moment he called you insecure. Asking questions doesn\u2019t make you insecure.

That phrase has a very negative connotation in our society and will most likely sound accusatory. My girlfriend does this to me when we're talking about mundane topics and it irritates me to no end because I know she's just trying to start a fight.",

            "Big red flag, how he snapped at you like that... I'd tread lightly, or even just leave before you get your heart crushed. Tell the friend husband too to try and get more info maybe.",
            "You should break up with him, I was in a similar situation with my ex-boyfriend he kept texting this girl and I honestly didn\u2019t care at all (we\u2019ve been dating for like 3 months), until he started acting weird and when I saw the messages he was literally confessing his love for her and how I was just someone to pass time with until she dated him, she didn\u2019t and I didn\u2019t broke up with him and instead I stayed for another 2miserable years in a relationship full of abuse/manipulation and cheating towards me, so please I beg you don\u2019t make the same mistake.",
            "Trust your gut. \u201cIf you have to ask..\u201d you probably know this isn\u2019t normal. The main concern is his reaction. The fact he was \u201cinforming\u201d you about texting his friends girl then immediately gets defensive and lashes out.....there\u2019s something going on there.  Especially when your response was completely rational and trusting. It\u2019s almost as if he wanted or was expecting a confrontation?? This reminds me of what some insecure and immature girls would do to get a rise out of their SO \u201cso they know they care\u201d. Complete BS. Your BF is 30 and is testing/pushing your boundaries. Then to push it further and ask if his friends can text you??? The whole thing feels off and very strange. \n\nEither that or he was projecting and dropping \u201chalf truths\u201d of what is really going on with the whole texting thing. Personally, I would set aside time to try to understand this better and set clear boundaries!!",
            "not okay. But you know that already. It feels like he is trying to toe the line as much as possible, which is not healthy.",
            "Would he be okay with his friends texting you daily?",
            "I don't think the texting in itself is weird, but his approach and reaction are very strange. My BF has been friends with his friend group for 10+ years and all of the guys/girls in that friend group are married or in serious relationships and text each other on occasion (my BF is usually the organizer of most friend group hangouts so the wives/GFs will occasionally text him for details). However it definitely doesn't happen daily and there's definitely no point in time it's ever weird or seems like he's 'confessing' something. It seems like your BF knows he's somehow pushing a boundary and is confiding in you about it because he knows keeping it a secret is wrong...? It's great he wants his friend's future wife to feel included but it's not really his place to do so. I'm ok with my BF texing my friends and vice versa, but everyone has different levels of trust involved and it seems like your BF is being sneaky.\n\nI would perhaps reframe the question as \"does _____ know you are texting his wife? How does he feel about it?\" and go from there. If his friend is unaware he is texting his future wife so much... there may be problems. Him grilling you over being insecure is SO not ok and shows there's probably more happening behind the scenes.\n\nNext time you all hangout together I would try to sublty drop hints like \"oh it's great you and my BF are getting along so well!\" next time you see her. She needs to learn some boundaries too if she's getting married in a few days and suddenly has all this extra free time to text YOUR boyfriend...? Weird.",
            "Don't trust him. Tone is everything. And it sounds like a guilty tone from what you say. You may be wrong but you have to trust yourself. My guess is he really did just want to get friendly and know the woman. Then she started gossipping and talking bad about his friend and getting flirty with him. When they happened he wanted to cut some of the guilt so he told you about texting her. When there was any mention of his being out of the ordinary he got super defensive. The point is... Boundaries have been most likely crossed. It's on him to fix it.",
            "I think he\u2019s projecting - but not in a suspicious way. I think he feels it\u2019s not the socially normal thing to do, he fears judgement and is getting upset about ambiguous words like \u201cinteresting\u201d. \n\nIf you believe he\u2019s been honest about the content of their messages then he\u2019s just found a cool friend to gossip with. And he came to you with this.",
            "Don't trust him.  Not even a little.  He's clearly got a guilty conscience and loves texting chicks.  Stay alert, my friend.",

            "I personally would not be okay with all the texting. I deleted all my male friends from my phone when my husband and I got married. I know some would consider that extreme but it was out of respect for my husband. He\u2019s the only male companion I need. \n\nI just don\u2019t think your bf\u2019s relationship with his friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is appropriate, and his reaction is crazy. I would definitely question this.",

            "He 100% wants to bang her.",
            "Is he texting her? Or is she texting him? There is a difference.\n\nCuz he could be feeling guilty because he didn't really initiate this (he just wanted to make communication easier for her; I have my husband's bffs number for emergencies) and then was replying out of politeness unit he *finally* realized that it was weird (most men are dumb like this, including my husband).\n\nThere's zero reason you shouldn't be allowed to read the messages if he has nothing to hide.",

            "Only read the title and WEIRD .",
            "It sounds like he\u2019s gaslighting you",
            "Ugh, the comments so far have been horrible. Also I keep seeing people talk about how he hasn't shown you the conversation, when you haven't even said that.\n\nHere's the thing, why would he bring this up in the first place if he's cheating? He's trying to communicate a situation that he knows is weird, because it is, but not something inherently bad. Yet it looks bad and it's easy to make assumptions about. As you've seen by the comments.\n\nSo he's then insecure about you being insecure, and he's not good about assuming otherwise. Because it looks bad, and he could lose you, but it's because he's developed a friendship, which should be allowed of partners. He tried to grill you about being in the same situation, because then he would know that you can empathize with the circumstances. You don't feel like it would be the same for you, so his insecurities about you being insecure got reinforced. Like imagine yourself with a different boyfriend, and he got upset that you were talking to an old friends husband because you two like the same stuff. How abusive that situation could get if you were banned from talking to him, or other friends, and the dilemma that would put you in if you valued that relationship. That's what this guy appears to be worried about, as a fear, not because of your behavior. Like nothing you've done so far appears abusive in any way, I just want to preface that because of the analogy, but he's in a situation where he has to talk to his friends less, as to not jeopardize your relationship.\n\nIt comes down to this. Do you trust him, or not? Do you both have faith in each other, and a verbal commitment to not cheat on each other, or not? Have you two defined the lines you wouldn't cross, because you respect your relationship? These are the things that will squash his fear about you breaking up with him, and help grow you two closer together. The more communication about this, the better.",

            "You\u2019ve been dating him for 7 months and you mentioned that this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s talked to a girl continuously like this, that itself is a huge red flag. You two haven\u2019t even been together a year and he\u2019s already developed this pattern. As for his response, all I\u2019m gonna say is hit dogs holler the loudest. I\u2019d try communicating why this is a problem for you and just having an honest conversation with him, if he can\u2019t hold that conversation without trying to put any guilt or blame onto you, then somethings wrong and I would seriously reconsider the relationship",

I wouldn't worry about this one bit. if you have actual evidence he's cheating or acting inappropriately, that's one thing, but if it's just \"he's acting weird\" and \"now it's making me weird,\" there are a million possible explanations and most of them are fine.",

It sounds like she may be interested in more than just texting and he needs to realize that and stop.

            "Im just going to throw this out there and maybe I am being overly optimistic. I got married a little bit less than a year ago, and this time last year I was super, super stressed out. Like, I cried on the phone with my uncle for 45 minutes about dumb shit stressed out. Me and my husband got in an open screaming match in Men's Warehouse kind of stressed. I've never been pregnant, but I've been told that you look at the aftermath of when your child is born and forget the 30 hours of painful AF labor, think of weddings as the same thing. You focus on the amazingness of the wedding, and forget the time you had a panic attack at the florist because flowers were pink instead of red (actually happened).\n\nMy first instinct is that if your BF is as close to the groom as you say he is, he may feel that he is doing his friend a favor by giving the friend's bride a chance to just vent somewhere safe. This way he is preventing her having a meltdown with his friend.\n\nMy second thought was that I've lived with my husband for 5 years now, and the only time we ever lied or kept things from each other was during the wedding. For instance, I planned singing for my husband (because he likes it, not like an ego thing) and he choreographed removing the garter (which was the hottest thing my husband has ever done), complete with taking a lesson with Chippendale's dancers. If there is some kind of surprise that the bride is doing for the groom and your BF is helping with it, this could also be the case. If he's been forced to keep a secret from everyone at the wedding, that could explain the confession-y part of it.\n\nI do think that his reaction is off, but it could be a little bit on both of you. I think any woman hearing that their BF has been talking daily to another woman would sound a bit defensive, and then it's just a jenga game of building up defensiveness until the tower falls over. I would wait and see what happens after the wedding and honeymoon are over. It could just be that he is doing this because of the upcoming wedding, and then once all the craziness subsides, their daily contact will too.",

            "I just skimmed some of the other comments and saw he doesn't allow you to see his phone. Privacy is acceptable and fine in relationships but only to a certain extent. Personally I don't ask to go through my husbands convos with his buddies cuz \"guy stuff\" and I expect the same from him when it comes to the girls BUT if he's texting some chick that same respectful rule does not apply. Guys often say \"We know how guys think\" when we girls talk about having guy friends or that colleague at work thats nice to you or whatever so I always tell my husband \"Well I know how girls think...\" If he wants to comfort you he better show that convo.",
            "Maybe he's oblivious to what he's doing, just a possibility. I made friends with my best friend's boyfriend way back when, she didn't really like how much we talked, and I completely understood after I realized how often he and I were texting about generally random things. After they talked, and we talked, we both realized lines were crossed and we stepped back, we're still friends and they're still dating, she recently came to hang out a few weeks ago. \n\nTalk about it some more without passive aggressuve behavior and keep it civil, if he's still getting defensive over it I'd just take it as a loss and move on.

And his intense reaction to it is what's more worrisome than the texting, itself. \n\nWhat it sounds like to me is that this guy isn't a match for you and your values. He's already over-stepped boundaries before. He's clearly doing it again, judging from his own defensiveness and then his insistence that you're wrong to have a limit with not being super texty with your friends. That's your right to keep some  boundaries between him and your friends, especially since you're not in a marriage-type relationship. \n\nYou might not want to dump him right away, but end it soon. He's not the right guy for you. The longer you stick it out, the longer the sunken cost fallacy will make it harder for you to leave.

I've seen a lot of discussion here about advising you to start messaging his friend, but I would suggest that group chatting instead.

At the end of the day, it\u2019s about if you feel comfortable with him and keep this relationship going.  Your relationship is still not too long and you certainly don\u2019t want to waste time in the future on argument.  Life is too short.",
            "Maybe he just got defensive because he was expecting you to not be okay with it, and he was surprised when you were",
            "I had a similar situation. My ex and me (who's still kind of an on and off) got into several arguments because he was texting one of his friends wife from the flea market and she would call him randomly at night and talk about random things and apparently said her and her husband \"do her own thing\" and I wasn't having it.\n\nCome to find out every female who's s.o. go there hate her for the same reason with their partners. \n\nTrust your instinct.",

The fact he responded \u201cwhat do you mean interesting\u201d isn\u2019t further fact he\u2019s hiding something, it means you asked him a probing question and he was reacting to that.\n\nNow, his confessional style \u201cI\u2019ve been talking\u201d is probably what triggered your initial question (but it doesn\u2019t matter who started this, only how you go forward in making each other feel secure).\n\nFact is, he may have a slight crush (but those happen in relationships) or he just feels bad as men/women friendship is strange to him. How many friends who are girls does he have?",

We hadn't seen each other in years, when he realized he had the wrong number, we chatted a bit, the usual; How are the kids, blah blah.

A few of them and I share some interests, so we send each-other related memes and such.  I\u2019d have no problem with my wife reading our conversations.\n\nThe fact that he got defensive real fast is a red flag."

        "selftext": "Together for 5 years now, first year married. We bought our first house 2 years ago and are currently in the market for something larger. We're in no rush and are waiting for the perfect house. Yesterday our realtor showed us a listing for a house that my wife absolutely fell in love with. It's a house I've actually been in before and it is **really** nice. I work as a community nurse and one of my palliative patients from a few months ago lived in this house. While the house does check all of my boxes off too I fear that living in it will constantly remind me of my work in that house. Drawing up meds, doing assessments, rushing over to their house at midnight multiple times after they called my pager frantically, calling 911 during an emergency situation , and eventually returning to pronounce the patient's death all over the span of a couple months.\n\n\n\nMy wife thinks that I'm just being silly and once we move in, renovate, and make it our own I won't feel that way anymore. I strongly disagree. I've been doing my job for 4 years now and while you certainly become \"desensitized\" to the work there's still certain cases and patients who stand out.. and this was absolutely one of them. The house checks literally all of our boxes (under our price range, perfect size, large property, and ideal neighborhood) so she's really insistent. I don't even want to go for a viewing of the house.\n\n\n\n\n**TL;DR:** Wife fell in love with a house. I'm not interested because I had a palliative patient who lived there. Am I being unreasonable?\n\n\n\n**EDIT:** It wasn't a traumatic event for me. I specialize in palliative care and this was an expected death in the home. I've lost count on the number of patient's that I've pronounced or help stay comfortable during their last days and weeks - it's something I do at my job daily. That said - I still don't find it comfortable purchasing this house because of the history. I don't want to come home to somewhere that I used to work. \n\n\n\n",

            "We bought a house that I knew as well.  I was friends with the previous owners and was in the house a lot.  Mind you it wasn't a traumatic experience but I strongly associated the house with the previous owners and felt like a permanent guest in someone's home at the beginning.  But then we renovated, painted everything, and moved in our own furniture.  And instantly it was my house.  I don't even think of the previous owners anymore.  The transformation was surprising and within a few weeks.  I think your wife is right.  You can make the house your own.",
            "I don't think it's necessarily a stupid reason, I've heard much worse.\n\nHowever, realistically when do you think you could expect to have another chance at one of your 'dream homes' again? If it's one every few months, I'd just skip this one.\n\nIf not taking this one realistically means having to wait a few years to have a chance at something comparable, then I'd give the 'see if I can make it my own' a chance. ",
            " I am also a community nurse and spend a lot of my time with palliative patients. There have been a few where I've gotten professionally close with the client and family and when driving past their homes during shift I pause and think about them.\n\nI don't know how I would feel if my partner wanted to moved into a home where I had been heavily involved in patient care . I can totally understand your concern about constantly being reminded of work. cooking at night and suddenly remembering filling up syringe drivers on the counter. or watching tv on my sofa and looking over at the corner where the hospital bed sat. i wouldn't be able to feel like i could settle down that plus watching way to many horror movies would probably make it a no from me.\n\nHowever I can also see the flip side that if it was a nice case and the patient passed comfortably and the family was kind it might also be nice to fill it up with love and life again. maybe painting the walls and changing the carpets will help and once you put your own stuff in the home you might feel differently you're also young and might spend a long time in this house, it may slowly start to feel more and more like home as you grow in your relationship and maybe start a family the memories of who owned it before will fade and you will have new memories to replace them with.\n\nBut I really do feel it boils down to how much of a hard limit this for you. If you can articulate to your wife why this isn't good for you mentally and can explain yourself then I feel like that's enough of an excuse to not want to live somewhere. There are plenty of reasons people say no to perfectly good houses and they are always valid. There will be other houses.",

            "I could see this go either way.  \n   \nIt comes down to the fact that if one person doesn't want a house... you don't buy the house.   Even if you totally disagree with them.  \n    \nBut your wife will now pick apart any houses you look at & blame you when they come up short in comparison.  \n   \nSo if you want to hold your ground here, be ready for it to affect the entire home buying process.   ",
            "I am a palliative care doctor, who works in the community setting, so I get it.  I don\u2019t know if I could move into a home that had been a patient\u2019s, it would be such a blurring of the boundaries that we need to keep ourselves healthy in the work that we do.  When we do work like ours in someone\u2019s home it is an enormous privilege to be let into someone\u2019s most intimate space, I can\u2019t imagine trying to set up my home, and my life, in a space I had so clearly thought of as someone else\u2019s and associated strongly with a patient I had offered that degree of care to, it would feel like I was always an intruder in a way.  This would be especially if it was one of the cases that stay with you, like this was for you.  Even in the inpatient setting it can be jarring to move a new patient quickly into a bed that was just occupied by someone who you knew well, who really touched you.  This is such a universal experience for palliative care workers that one place I worked at had a room blessing ceremony for staff to help us deal with that.  Hopefully your wife can understand and let this go.  ",
            "You had a patient die just a few months ago--that's traumatic. Do you get any emotional support for things like that? Therapy through work? What do you do to take care of your mental health? Because I'm more concerned about that.\n\nYour wife is right, a house can be remade in its owners' image. Your brain can also be remade for the benefit of the person it's driving. If the thought of even seeing the house is this painful for you then you might want to talk it through with a professional, not with her.",
            "I think your wife is right and your previous memories would fade, however they wouldn\u2019t fade completely. You\u2019d still remember what happened there.\n\nIt might help her understand your perspective if you go to the viewing with her and she listens to you describe the things that happened with the patient, assuming you can do so without violating privacy laws. It\u2019s one thing to say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in this house, I had a patient.\u201d It\u2019s quite another to say, \u201cThis is where I they were that first time I had to rush over at night. They were curled up in a cot in the corner, wheezing...\u201d It will be unpleasant, but it will get the point across.",
            "We bought my parents\u2019 house and renovated and lived in it for eight years, but I was never really comfortable with it. I tried to ignore my feelings about it but they never went away; it was a great house and I had a pretty happy childhood but I always felt like I was playing house, especially when my mom came to visit. It was frustrating, because I tried to get over it. I just couldn\u2019t. I was relieved when we moved to a smaller, objectively less awesome house.\n\nYou seem pretty sanguine about your job, which is a very hard one involving lots of emotion management and suppressing, so I\u2019m guessing you have a very good sense of what you can let go and what you can\u2019t. I\u2019d listen carefully to that. \n",
            "Yeah, I\u2019m a social worker and wouldn\u2019t want live in a patient\u2019s old house. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in the homes of older adults and people who were on hospice. It would be totally different if this were a family member or friend\u2019s house. My grandmother actually died in my current house, in the same bedroom I sleep in, and I painted and changed the carpet and it\u2019s never bothered me at all. A patient\u2019s house is different though. Maintaining a work - life separation is very important for some people with this type of job. For once, I actually disagree with most of the comments on here. ",
            "\"I can't ever see myself fully relaxing here.\" There are all sorts of reasons to reject a house, and all are valid. \"Bad vibes,\" is one of the best reasons to reject one. The real problem will be can your wife get over it quickly or will this be something she romanticizes as \" the one that got away.\"",
            "Hm, this is interesting. I am also a nurse so I can empathize with you, I could see that being draining. From your edit, I understand it's not a traumatic memory, but still, it can be exhausting to constantly think about your past patients, especially in hospice care. You want your space to be a place where you can wind down, relax and decompress, especially when you're in a stressful field, which we both know nursing (especially your type of nursing) is. \n\nI would stay firm on this. Your wife needs to understand and compromise with you on this. There will be other houses that come up that will match you two. A marriage, especially when investing in such a big purchase, is a compromise. I would say sit down with her and walk her through your thoughts on this and ask her to understand your side.\n\nGood luck.",
            "Oh man! I totally support you. Doing the kind of work you do means that you have a huge amount of compassion fatigue. Still, to everyone who says just get the house, they're missing out on an essential piece of well-being for caregivers: work/home separation. No one wants to live where they've worked.\n\nTalk openly to your wife about it and about her attachment: tell her you have attachment too, but to work, and talk about what you did in that house, the death. Talk openly about your need for separation and for your house to be a calm, relaxing place. This is a totally normal need. People choose not to buy houses all the time that have \"bad vibes\", and this is much more concrete feelings than that. More importantly, she needs to respect your opinion and veto in the house buying process. This one simply isn't for you.\n\nIf you want to be really petty you could call it the death house anytime it comes up. ",
            "You guys are only 24 and not in a rush to buy your SECOND HOUSE. There will be other houses. Just be patient and another house will come along that checks all your boxes that you BOTH love. What's more important to your wife, a potential house that she just discovered or finding a house that you both want to live in? How can she not understand that you dont want to live where you worked? The fact that you don't even want to go to a viewing should speak volumes to her and be taken into consideration with such a big purchase. It seems pretty simple to me.",
            "Your home is supposed to be a sanctuary...a way to get away from your work.  I don't think you're being unreasonable at all.  \n\nAlso, a house is a huge investment, and the process of buying one is a life-changing event.  If you aren't going into it with all cylinders firing, that can be a recipe for disaster.  I've seen it mentioned here a couple times, but it's worth repeating:  if one of you doesn't feel right with the house, you shouldn't buy it.",
            "RN here. I\u2019ve never worked in palliative but trauma is trauma...if you\u2019re unsure about it, it doesn\u2019t sound like buying it would be a safe investment at this time. Also, it doesn\u2019t sound like your wife is really hearing you re: your feelings. If it were me I would put the general hunt on hold for now and focus on your relationship (but I\u2019m unmarried so :P) best of luck to you both",
            "Your reasoning is not stupid. Healthcare workers are required to separate themselves from their work in order to function as normal human beings. Once your home life and work life merge, you\u2019re no longer able to separate yourself. I worked in an ER for a year and now I\u2019m in medical  school. If I brought everything I saw in the ER home I wouldn\u2019t be able to function normally. You have to protect yourself sometimes. ",
            "I agree that your wife is right and that once you make the house your own, the association will fade in time. Do you really think this is a patient who will stay on your mind for years to come? \n\nIf the answer is yes, do you think you could try to re-frame the experience in your mind?? Instead of 'this is where my patient had respiratory distress' and 'this is where my patient died', think 'this is where I was able to provide the best care I could to someone who really needed it' and 'I'm glad I could be the person this family looked to for support in the worst time of their life.'\n\nThis is an event that just happened and the house is somewhere you will stay for potentially 30+ years. The memories of this patient WILL fade and so will the emotions associated with them. I think if the house is as perfect as you say, you should make an effort for your wife's sake.\n",
            "I\u2019m with you. I\u2019m not hearing \u201ctrauma\u201d like other commenters are reading into it. I\u2019m hearing \u201cdistaste\u201d and \u201cit will make home feel like work.\u201d\n\nI get that. Someone might not want to live in the office building where their former job was. It makes it feel like you\u2019re coming \u201chome\u201d to a job location.\n\nIt *might* fade, in time. But yeah, it might not. And if it\u2019s really nice \u201cas is\u201d, do you want to spend $50-$100k to completely rehab and change things so it feels different?\n\n\u201cPhew, this is the room where every day I\u2019d have to wipe their butt and help them back into bed. I\u2019d want to completely redo this room - tear down that wall and put a new wall over here.\u201d Make it concrete and real for her and make clear how expensive it would be to change everything so it\u2019s entieely different. \u201cThis brick facade is such a reminder of rushing here middle of the night to administer emergency meds- I\u2019d want to tear that off completely and replace it with siding.\u201d\n\nEtc. I think she\u2019ll eventually get it, hopefully :-/\n\nBut I also worry about you and your relationship. It sounds like she\u2019s saying \u201cget over it your feelings aren\u2019t that important.\u201d That lack of listening and validating your feelings sounds unhealthy. Is she like that for other decisions?",
            "There will be another suitable house.  You each get a veto on a decision like home purchase, and it is reasonable for you to veto for this reason.  Your wife needs to respect your veto.  \n\nThat said, I think you should do some extra legwork to find the next suitable house.  Your wife is going to be frustrated about passing up on a good house, so you need to put in some extra energy to get to the next one.",
            "This is so hard because it's a case of completely different mindsets and neither one is wrong, but equally there isn't really a middle ground. \n\nIt's like murder houses - I wouldn't want to live in a house that something terrible had happened in, which is a completely emotional (not logical) response. My partner would just see it as an opportunity to ask for money off the asking price.\n\nI think you should stick to your guns on this one. There will be other houses, and moving is stressful enough as it is, you don't want to start off on the wrong foot. ",
            "From another nurse to you. Your concerns are valid. The likelihood that she will fall in love with another house is probably greater than your chances of shaking the patient care that went on in that house. Even walking through hallways and doorways are enough to trigger the memory. Your concerns aren\u2019t to be discarded.\n\nTo those who are advising therapy and re-examining of his feelings...\n\nPeople go into palliative care because death doesn\u2019t cause them the same kind of uncomfortableness that it causes most of the general population. These people accept death as a natural and inevitable process. They care about the patient\u2019s quality of life. But you cannot be invested in every patient heavily, it will ruin you emotionally. And living in a prior patient\u2019s house would be a little too invested for me.",
            "How hard is it to find houses that check all your boxes? If you are in a market where you could find another perfect house, I think it's reasonable to say no for this reason. If it's been hard finding houses that work for you, I would really try to concider what you could do to make it work.\n\n\n\n\nI kind of agree with your wife in that I feel like if you changed it up a lot you wouldn't have such strong associations with your patient and the house. \n\n\n\nI think you should at least go to a viewing. You are basing this on feelings you *might* get when you go to the house. You could go and realize that you don't really feel anything about the house. If they have already removed all of his stuff, it could just feel like any other house.\n\n\n\n",
            "I don\u2019t understand why people think this is your personal mental health issue to get over. It makes perfect sense to me that you wouldn\u2019t want to live in a house with bad memories. I\u2019m more concerned about the fact that your wife doesn\u2019t seem to care about your feelings. ",
            "Remodeling is a lot of work and money I just bought my mom's old house and completed redid 75% of it. Sold my townhome to buy it and made a decent chunk of change for the remodel, but still expensive. \n\nThis will be your home. If you will always think of what happened there or have a bad taste in your mouth, this is not your home. Nope outta this and put your foot down. ",
            "Your perspective is perfectly fair in my opinion. \n\nHonestly, I think it's okay for you to decide that the house is off limit because of your history. It's one house out of what I assume to be at least thousands of houses in the market. Sit your wife down and explain to her that although renovation may make you feel different, you don't want to risk being constantly reminded of a certain patient or of your work in your home, and hence this house is not the perfect house for you. \n\nEven if it is silly (it isn't imo), this is not the lottery - there will be another house that you both love, and you aren't in any rush. Marriages are all about little compromises here and there. Houses are one of the largest purchases and you don't want to make a choice that you regret. This is not a battle worth fighting. \n\nIf your wife for some reason insists on this one house - I think you have a bigger thing to worry about. Is it a common theme for her to go \"my way or the highway\"? \n\nBtw, I disagree with the other comments that are asking you to buy the house and just rennovate it - sure, you can do that if you want. But say if we have a stressful job that we work day in and day out. Say the office went on sale. How many of us would want to put down thousands or millions of dollars so we can call it home? \n\nThere are sooo many other options. Why pick one you associate with negatively? ",
            "It\u2019s certainly unfair and insensitive of her to call your reason \u201cstupid\u201d.\n\nThis actually seems like one of the better reasons I\u2019ve heard NOT to but a house.\n\nIf you are not in a rush, and only bought the house you are currently living in 2 years ago... I would wait until you find something without such negative associations for you.  Buyer\u2019s remorse sucks, and buying a new house is a larger purchase and commitment you should feel certain about.\n\nUnless this house is at an incredible value, there is really no reason to rush.  You can always find another house.  After only 2 years in the current one, you don\u2019t even have the equity built up to make rushing into a new home purchase financially advantageous.\n\nYou have more cons than pros here, in my opinion, and plenty of reasons to keep searching.",
            "Ok, buying a house each person gets veto rights. If you are not comfortable buying it, honestly your wife  does not even need to understand the ins and outs of it - only that you aren't comfortable with it. I understand the feeling of thinking the house is perfect...and she has a right to try and figure out why in case there is some compromise that can be reached but it sounds like there isn't. \n\nHer saying you're being silly is basically her telling you that your feelings are not important to her. She doesn't need to agree for your feelings about it to be valid. To me, this is like names. Say this was you guys picking names out for a kid - she fell in love with the name Bradley but you knew a Bradley growing up and are not interested in the name due to that. Vetoed. That's it. No Bradley. \n\nIf you are so disinterested in this house you don't even want to go to a viewing I think she seriously just needs to stop pushing it. There are going to be other houses, and if that one is perfect at least now your realtor knows exactly what you guys are looking for, especially since it's not the house itself it's just that you worked there. I mean, I wouldn't want to live somewhere where I watched someone, for my job no less, slowly die...",
            "Did the neighbours see you come and go? Will they remember your face? Do you plan to tell them you cared for the person who lived there?\n\nBecause this whole thing seems to me like a great setup for rumors regarding exploitation of the elderly.\n\nEven if the purchase is 100% legal and not related to your connection to that person, it takes just one asshole and now your workplace is getting called up, your professional reputation or perhaps even your whole career ruined.\n\nI would dig in and take a hard pass on this one.",
            "I think that the fact that your wife thinks your emotions are stupid is more concerning than the fact that you cannot agree on a living space. ",
            "I\u2019m a career first reporting I have some areas that are hard for me to go by or spend time in due to calls. \n\nI would ask your realtor if you view it a second time and spend an hour or two by yourself there and see how you feel. If you feel this is a deal breaker then you should be honest with your wife. A house is a huge financial commitment. It wouldn\u2019t be in your or her interest if you bought it and then had to sell it or rent it out in a year because you don\u2019t feel comfortable in your own home. ",
            "Did she straight-up say that you were being silly?  Because that seems pretty unempathetic.  I can see where her logic is coming from, but the way she's saying it is completely disrespectful/patronizing if this is a direct quote from her. \n\nIf it's such a turnoff for you that you don't even want to go in for a viewing, then I'd stand your ground.

In a few months she'll probably find another one that she loves just as much and that you didn't have to watch a patient slowly die in.\n\nThere are certain things you don't completely get over and don't want to be reminded of every single day and that's okay. It's totally okay to not want to move into a home that holds that weight and memory for you. In fact, I suggest you don't, because that's how like 90% of horror movies start.",

            "Op, you've gotten a lot of great advice on communicating with your wife more clearly why you don't want this house. I just wanted to add that during our house search I fell in love with 2 houses that checked all our boxes before we found THE house. I am so glad it all worked out the way it did because I cannot even imagine living in either of those houses now. Let her grieve a little, because it is hard when you think it's the house and envision living there. Something much better will come along. ",

When me and my wife were buying a house there was a very nice place in a village close to our city but it was incredibly close to my previous job, which I hated... I didn't want to constantly be reminded of that place of work or risk running into old co-workers I'd rather not see so asked if we could not pursue the place and she understood.\n\nI know the situations aren't the same here but if a house gives you negative feelings I wouldn't want to buy it.",

And we had a pretty wide geographic area we were looking into, so there were always dozens on the market in our price range. We were very picky and if EITHER OF US had a gripe with a house, nobody would call the other stupid, we would cross it off the list and move on. You both deserve to be comfortable in a home, especially if this is supposed to be a long-term residence. If it takes you a little bit longer to find the perfect one, it's really not the end of the world.\n\nOn the flip side, what happens if you move in and cannot get over your discomfort? How long will your wife insist that you just need to \"get over it\" before she agrees you need to move? What if she never reaches that point? Would that lead to divorce? How long would you two be fighting due to the disagreement over the house? How awful does moving for the 3rd time in as many years sound?\n\nYour wife is being incredibly immature. Your feelings ARE valid and if she loves you she should respect that. Please, move on from this house.",

Im getting my MA in professional counseling and school counseling, with trauma/ptsd patients there is this phenomenon where they will often avoid a particular place/house/location/sound/song whatever - because it reminds them of that traumatic moment. I know it may not have been a traumatic moment but it was a moment of strong emotion for you, this house holds strong emotions for you and strong memories, especially strong negative emotions and memories. I feel you will never truly feel calm, collected, or in harmony with yourself if you live in the house your wife has fallen in love with. I hope you can convince her, for your mental health, this is not the one. if its perfect to her, it should be perfect for BOTH of you, you both will be living there.

            "I had something similar earlier this year.\n\nI was looking for a place to rent, and a house came up in a nice area. I went and checked it out, and its last owner was an older person who'd had it a long time and it was a bit run down. The address was familiar, and I checked it the next day at work, and I'd helped administer the will and estate of the old fella who'd lived there and died about six months back. There were some aspects of his situation I was disappointed with - how the outcome left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nI figured I could never be happy living in his house, so I passed on it, even though it ticked plenty of boxes.\n\nNo OP, I don't think you're silly. I think you need to explain to your wife that house holds negative memories for you, and you could not be comfortable there. How she deals with the disappointment - that tells you a lot about her.",

Tell your wife your concerns and that you aren't willing to commit or sign financing for a house unless you both agree about how great it is and both want to go all in. It's a huge investment for a marriage and it shouldn't be taken lightly.\n\nI made that mistake the first time my husband and I bought a house. I conceded and let him finance for the house he wanted, but I wasn't comfortable there and didn't really like the house. We later found out my intuition was right because of some paranormal experiences that happened to us and some other members of our family during our time there. I'm so glad to be rid of it, and now that we're buying again, I was sure not to concede on what I really wanted in a house this time. We're closing on one soon. It took a year and a half to find the perfect one, but we did it and we both are extremely excited.\n\nPoint: don't concede to your partner on a decision this big if you honestly feel this isn't the right house.

Living in a house where you treated someone isn\u2019t going to allow you the time you need away from your job. You have to have that time to be able to continue to do your job well. You\u2019re doing something very important for your patients.\n\nI am speaking from some experience with my husband.

His job related PTSD didn\u2019t kick in until almost 15 years after he had to retire. I don\u2019t like to think how it would have been if we\u2019d stayed in the city. \n\nI sincerely hope you don\u2019t ever have to deal with PTSD from your job. You may want to speak with a counselor at work about how living in a house where you treated a patient could effect your future mental health. That may be enough to get your wife to listen to your concerns. \n\nGood luck and thank you for the job you do.",

He moved in and decided that if he still felt all  the \"bad vibes\" he would sell it and buy something else. \n\nLong story short, he is very happy that he stayed. He has made it his own. It is his.

And, you may find yourself more open to the viewing if you go with yourself and a real estate agent or yourself in a friend versus your wife.

You say you're not in a rush, but have things maybe changed for her and she does feel in a little bit of a rush? Is that why she's so attached to this house? How long and how actively have you been looking and how long do you think you'll have to keep looking to find another house that meets all your criteria? I don't think you should move into a house you don't want to move into, but if you've been looking for 2 years and everything besides this house has been terrible, I can see why she's attached. However, if you've only been looking for 3 months and you already found a house that checks all your boxes, surely it's no big deal to keep looking for another 3 months. I think talking this through with your wife will give you a better sense of where she's at, and help you two figure out what kind of timeline you both actually want or are comfortable with. ",

Also, she endured quite a bit of life-long traumatic abuse in this home from her father and sisters. After the renovations, she ended up becoming close friends with the new owners of the house, and she and I have both been there countless times.

I was scared I would always associate my new home with, *that*. Let me tell you, my hesitation was quelled almost as soon as we got our stuff in and painted with some colours we (okay, *I* lol) love.

You need help to deal with the emotional fall outs from your work. You need to consider if passing on this house will screw your family in the future or not. If there are similar houses and you guys are well off, I don\u2019t imagine it\u2019s as a big issue then. If budget is tight and this is a rare find, not getting it because of a work hangup has the potential to set your family behind in a very real manner. \n\nEdit: have you seen a patient die before or was this your first? You need help processing this, and you need to tackle it soon.

Not my immediate family, but close enough that I spent every summer there and was incredibly familiar with it. On top of that, it belonged to my brother immediately before I bought it, and since I visited a lot during that time I was starting to think it would never feel like /my/ home. But it met everything I was looking for better than anything else on the market, so I moved foreward with the purchase.\n\nAnd boy oh boy, I was completely wrong to worry!! It\u2019s crazy because I remember practically growing up in this house, but the memories are completely detached from what is now \u201cmy home\u201d. The thing that made the biggest difference was just the simplest change - REPAINTING. Changing the color schemes is enough to give a space an entirely new feel. And then when you add your furniture and all your personal things, you will be right at home! If that\u2019s still not enough you can change out light fixtures and other small finishes as well that can make a big impact on overall feel of the space. \n\nSo I completely understand your concerns and they are reasonable, but trust that once you make it YOUR home, it will look and feel like a different house. c: Dont just move in and assimilate to how the previous owner had it setup, put your own style into it and that cuts off the associations.
