        "selftext": "I've been with my fiance Michael for almost four years now and it's been a great relationship so far. He proposed a month ago and we are both really excited to start our lives together. Hes truly wonderful. His family, well... :/\n\nMichael does not live in the same state as his family anymore and as a result I've only met his family a few times. He has said before that some of his family members can be weird and he was even hesitant for me to meet his siblings. \n\nHis siblings (both girls) are apparently really spoiled rotten individuals. Neither of the girls ever had to work while growing up and relied heavily on their parents money. Their parents treated them like royal princesses. Michael on the other hand was always expected to work from age 14 and go to school and achieve far more ( 4.0, be in  at least two clubs and two sports) than was expected of his sisters (who only were required to make Cs and do nothing more) Michael was rarely allowed to attend social events at school or go out on weekends. he did all chores and his parents treated him very different than his sisters. His sisters were incredibly mean to him as teenagers. Basically he was pushed around like a literal peasant until he had enough money to move out and was able to receive grants and scholarships to go to school. It was a lot of luck that played a part in his being able to attend undergrad and grad. If not for outside help, I believe his family would have left him to rot whilst giving the sisters everything they ever wanted. \n\nMichael is now an engineer while his sisters have basic minimum wage jobs (nothing wrong with that) however his sisters have done all they can to pester Michael about borrowing money, making him feel ashamed that he makes more money than they do, and even going as far as to claim that they deserve the money more than Michael does. They ask him monthly for money, which I just learned a year ago after Michael confessed to me in shame that he had been giving them money to help them through a rough patch for the past few months. \n\nApparently their mom and dad has refused to continue to support them to the large extent that they have been the past several years (maybe they finally got fed up, who knows) and now the sisters are looking to Michael. \n\nTina, Michaels eldest sister, is being really difficult lately. Apparently, she is bitter that Michael has not been giving her anymore money. And she is acting very strange about Michael's engagement. Apparently, Michael \"should he thinking about his family first\" before thinking of getting married and spending a bunch of money on a wedding and a wife. His sisters should be put first, apparently.  Now, supposedly she is pissed over my engagement ring. \n\nThis past weekend Michael and I went to visit the family and Tina and the whole family obviously learned about our recent engagement. I had never even met Michael's dad before because he travels so much for work. His mom seemed passive towards me and his dad kept asking me what my name was. It made me sad tbh. \n\nTina remarked on the large size of my engagement ring. Later in the day, she pulled Michael aside and told him that she was really suffering financially along with the rest of the family, and basically said. She was shocked Michael was forking over thousands of dollars for my engagement ring and the wedding rather than help out his own family. She said \"you've only known this chick for what, a few years? You're already giving her everything while you give your own family nothing.\" \n\nWell, Michael then informed her that my ring wasn't real diamond. It is moissanite, which I specifically wanted instead of a diamond. Michael could easily afford a diamond but we are saving our money and I liked the idea of moissanite. \n\nBut, Tina didn't believe that and expressed such. She stalked over to me in the kitchen and made a huge scene in front of everyone asking to see my ring, and examine it. She tried to play it off jokingly but I could see through it, and at one point she made a grab for my left hand. I refused to hand over my ring and Tina got emotional and the other sister, Hannah, soon butted in and asked what my problem was, Tina just wanted to look, what do I have to hide, etc. I just tried to calm the situation down as best I could and Michael kept telling them to mind their own business.\n\nHonestly, the whole thing was infuriating. We left after dinner to go stay in a hotel. Michael then told me how he thinks his sister is also jealous of me and my ring. Tina has  been engaged for over a year now with still no wedding planned, she was given a tiny ring. Albeit with a real diamond but it is very tiny. Mine, though fake, is big and sparkly and she remarked to him once that he had better not get me a prettier looking ring than she had. (Wtf?) Michael and I will be getting married fairly soon and she seems bitter that her own fiance has still not expressed a desire to start planning the wedding. She has also remarked in the past to Michael how I am too beautiful, and that my looks are somehow suspicious, and I'm just out to get his money. \n\nI make my own money as a nurse and I definitely am not using Michael for his money. \n\nNow, Tina has started creating all sorts of drama over this, posting on Facebook about how real men should know where their priorities lie, how real men stick by family and don't play with little girls who are gold diggers who only care about having a huge rock. One status said \"show me the paperwork and I might believe the ring isn't real lol\" and another one was some stupid quote about being distracted by shiny things that turn out to be coal in disguise. (Me I'm guessing lol) she commented \"lmao \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\" on my instagram picture of my ring. I deleted the comment.\n\nI only know this about her Facebook statuses because Michael showed me through his account. Tina deleted me off of everything and even blocked me. She sent out a mass email to the whole family and announced that her and Hannah will not be attending my wedding nor supporting Michaels marriage to me and then listing all of the reasons. (I don't really love him. I'm a gold digger, Michael doesn't care about his family anymore) \nHowever at the end of the email she said she may consider believing Michael if she saw proof that my ring wasn't real.\n\nReddit, I'm at a complete loss as to what to do here. Michael is also shocked but not really because he is so used to his sisters' antics. He took my side and I appreciate that but when I talked to him about cutting his family off for good he seemed hesitant. I think he just doesn't wanna create more drama. But I need him to draw hard lines here.\n\nThe thing is, I don't want Tina and Hannah coming along every few months asking for money and judging us. I don't want my marriage to involve their pettiness and begging. I won't give any of my hard earned money to them, that's for sure. I don't want Michael to either but I guess I can't force him not to. I just worry because that could be money our future children need. Or money WE need. \n\nHow can I handle this situation? At this point I never wanna see the sisters again. \n\n   \n**tl;dr**: crazy soon to be SILs are creating drama over my engagement ring, and telling everyone I'm a gold digger. ",

            "> she sent out a mass email to the whole family and announced that her and Hannah will not be attending my wedding\n\nHallelujah, she's done the dirty work for you!\n\nYou need to have a good long talk with Michael, with a counsellor present if necessary. You guys need to ensure you're both on the same page in regards to what your obligations to your extended family are, and how you spend your money now and in the future. \n\nI think cutting his sisters out of your lives should absolutely be a no-brainer for both of you, but it sounds like Michael's still struggling to let go of his internalised belief (no doubt hammered into him since childhood) that Sisters Are God and Must Be Obeyed.  But both of you are a team - work with him to extract himself from his toxic family (as it flies in the face of everything he's been taught from day one), but be firm with your boundaries.\n\nBut seriously, do not invite the sisters to the wedding. Even when they *belevolently* change their minds and decree that they will come to the wedding, even when they suck up to you, even when they demand to know why they aren't your bridesmaids, even when they kick and scream at you for stealing their brother away. Being invited to your wedding is a priviledge, not a right, and their behaviour has put them very very firmly in the negative. ",

            "My wife has an enormous engagement ring. (1.7 carats)\nEveryone believes it is a diamond. It's not, its a topaz. \nThe reason that I am not believed when I say that, is because topaz is normally blue and this is very clear. \nIt's pretty damn special to both of us, because her father cut the stone. \n\nNext thing, moissanite isn't fake. It is different to a diamond, and if you wanted it, it's special too. I'd rather a moissanite ring too. \n\nYour in laws are a lot like my wife's in laws. Materialistic, self absorbed, narcissistic assholes. You don't need them in your life. They have already made the decision to stay away from the wedding. Thank them for their thoughtfulness. \n\nI moved countries to escape my family, and now talk to them three or four times a year. \nNo regrets. ",
            "Umm you better decide what's going on with supporting his sisters before you get married.",
            "This is definitely going to be all up to him to set boundaries and draw lines. He needs to put his sisters in his place - he's not giving them an allowance, his relationship with you is not up for discussion, and how much he spent on your engagement ring is none of their business. \n\nYou two might benefit from pre-marital counseling to make sure you're both on the same page about key issues like helping family out with financial issues - it sounds like his sisters are used to running to him in an emergency and you both need to agree on how to handle future requests. When you bring it up with him I would phrase it as \"pre-marital counseling\" and not as \"therapy\" or something - you two both seem to be handling the situation well, but having an outside perspective to guide you through these discussions could be useful.",
            "Even if you cut them out completely, these women sound like the types to come back, and come back...and pretty much just be a sticky little stain forevermore.\n\nI think you need to tell him that you love him dearly, but that you simply don't think you can handle entwining your life with their's until you've both set hard lines. Like, really, what happens when you guys have kids? What if these women want to be involved then? Or what if their poor financial situation keeps you guys from being able to afford a necessity? ",
            "Wow. This situation reminds me a lot of my parents marriage and the way my dad's side of the family reacted after my dad got engaged with my mom. (FYI traditional Pakistani arranged marriage stuff between them).\n\nThe back story is that my dad had moved to America, got his Masters degree and continued to send money home to his family in Pakistan (mainly for his parents, but considering his younger, unmarried sisters still lived with his parents, the money was \"everyone's\"). Around this time my dad was 30 and had been sending money to his parents for almost a decade. He decided that he wanted to try and settle down and start a family. So his parents set him up with my mom, they liked each other, and went forward with the marriage. My dad's sisters weren't too happy. My dad getting married and starting a family meant that my dad would be sending less money to Pakistan to his parents and sisters. Dad was (rightfully) pissed because the money he sent was more for his elderly parents rather than his sisters who never ended up doing anything with their education.\n\nLong story short, they tried to sabotage my parents wedding. Really made my mom miserable during the whole ordeal. Long story, but not really worth detailing. My mom (god bless her), tried to forgive and help one of the sisters with her own wedding a few years later, but it really went to shit. My parents organized, paid for her wedding, and let her stay in their home for months, and all my aunt could focus on was \"me me me, why didn't you do X, Y, and Z (costly things) for my wedding?\"\n\nShe still doesn't talk to us. But has no problem asking my dad for money! \n\nI don't know if there will be any fixing your relationship with your future sister in laws. Just by looking at the way my family has been dealing with a similar situation for two and a half decades. Greedy, entitled people dont start to change their tune at this age. Not when they've had things handed to them their entire lives. They will probably always blame you for their brother ceasing to send them money. \n\nThe ONLY times I EVER saw my parents fight was when it involved my aunts. They've otherwise had a happy marriage. This will not be the last time you will deal with your fianc\u00e9e's sisters, even if yoh decide to not pursue a relationship with them. Be prepared for that.",
            "I think you need to resolve the MUCH larger issue than the ring here.\n\nMichael is TERRIBLE at setting boundaries with his sisters. He enables their narcissism massively.  He needs INTENSE therapy, and realistically to go zero contact with them both.\n\nI think this therapy should be a precondition of marrying him.  He doesnt understand how awful this relationship is.  He is too used to being a pushover who people bully into things and that MUST change before you marry him.",
            "Frankly, them boycotting your wedding is the best wedding present they could possibly give you. \n\nI'll be blunt, you are **never** going to win with these women. They will never be your family, they will never like you, and they will never stop asking you for money. \n\nThe less contact you have with them the better to be honest. ",
            "> I talked to him about cutting his family off for good he seemed hesitant\n\nHis sisters are shit, and they deserve to be cut out from your lives. But there is a way to compromise between you and Michael. Instead of cutting all ties with them, you could temporarily cut contact. Like, he doesn't need to go visit them until they apologize. Or, if he's on the phone with one of them, if they start bitching about the ring, then he can hang up. And definitely not give them any more money.\n\nBasically, temporarily block them and tell them he won't talk to them until they apologize.",
            "W O W.\n\nUnless he decides to draw a hard line here, you are going to be married to a man who is supporting his sisters, who feel completely ok about abusing you.\n\nThis is not ok.\n\nI would honestly tell Michael that by not cutting them off, he is tacitly condoning their abuse of you. He actually does need to make a decision here. It's not fair to ask you to put up with that kind of abuse.\n\nBlock them on all social media, and seriously consider if you want to marry into this crazy, given that the only one who can set boundaries is him and he's not willing to do so.",
            "Whenever anyone wants \"proof\" of the value of your engagement ring, I believe that the proper response is: \"go fuck yourselves\".",
            "Michael's sisters are losers. Their enabler parents ironically didn't enable them to be productive adults but emotionally stunted leeches. The scapegoat won out in the end over the golden children. Or he will if he cuts these truly awful people out and focuses on his real family, the one you're building together. If he doesn't, I honestly don't see a healthy relationship surviving them.",
            "His sister isnt jealous of your ring.\n\nHis sister is threatened by you.  You are the one person right now that can cut off her cash cow.  She's probably spent years manipulating him and now you are about to unravel it all.\n\nMy first instinct is to let her know that she and her sister are uninvited due to her behavior.  No one gets to go to the wedding without supporting the couple, or at the very least acting civilized.\n\nMichael should probably go talk to a therapist at the very least.  Im not sure if he should cut off contact with his entire family, but his sisters should go VLC.  And he needs to stop giving them money.",
            "You need to have a serious talk with your fiance about giving money to his sisters, boundaries and the sort. Maybe you can agree that you are only going to help in the case of emergency, or that you are going to make a loan and not loan anymore till they pay it. \n\nThen you block them from your life, stop visiting them and let your fiance deal with them. They are his family and you don't have to suffer them, they have made very clear that they don't like you and they don't want to have a relationship with you, so don't.\n",
            "Who wants to bet that if OP gave into the SIL's ridiculous demands and provided proof for the rings, the SIL would start making snide remarks about OP not being \"good enough\" to \"deserve\" a diamond?\n\nJust ignore them, OP. They're bitter and unhappy with their lives so they tear other people down and stir up drama to make themselves feel better. They should only have your pity, not attention.",
            "There are a *lot* of good comments here, but there's something that comes to mind that hasn't been mentioned that I have experienced. \n\nA lot of people are saying go low contact or no contact with the family and this is good advice, but what hasn't been mentioned is that this will be extremely difficult for Michael to do. His entire life has been spent deferring to his family in nearly all things. And when he's around the family, he's very likely falling back into that pattern even though some part of him knows they are crazy. \n\nIt's going to feel very, very wrong for him to push back on the family about anything. It's going against who he's been his whole life. The \"not wanting to create drama\" is that manifesting. Drawing hard lines is going to be almost impossible right now in the beginning. It's not like flipping a switch. \n\nIt *is* possible for him to change his dynamic with his family, but it's going to take all of your support, a lot of introspection on his part, and very likely a fair amount of (yes, I'm going to say it) therapy. But he's got you on his side and that's a great start. Good luck. ",
            "What a bunch of jerks. What is your fiance saying to them? I agree with the \"no\" without other explanation that others suggest.\n\nOne thing to note though:\n\n>Neither of the girls ever had to work while growing up and relied heavily on their parents money. Their parents treated them like royal princesses. Michael on the other hand was always expected to work from age 14 and go to school and achieve far more ( 4.0, be in at least two clubs and two sports) than was expected of his sisters (who only were required to make Cs and do nothing more)\n\nThis is not actually a nice thing the parents did for the sisters, as you can see by the results. They raised your husband to be a useful adult and didn't bother to do the same with his sisters. Maybe it was spoiling, but I bet it was just lazy parenting or sexism.",
            "They're digging their own hole of embarassment.\n\nIf i were you, i would have screenshotted their comments on Facebook and said: \"Can you believe there are people out there who think getting engaged and married is a hobby that you can just quit to continue supporting 2 x mooching adults?\"\n\nThat said, you need to either get Michael on board with cutting the monthly gravy train or you need to keep separate finances and get a prenup before you marry.\n",
            "JESUS, his sisters sound fucking awful. What exactly is he gaining from his relationship with them? Maybe ask him. \"Family\" is the family you MAKE. If his sisters are so fucking awful, why the hell does he still give in to them. You need to set a HARD boundary, if he wants you in his life he needs to cut his damn sisters off and shut down ANY bad-mouthing you. He seems like he has NO spine against them. \n\n\nPlease get pre-marital counseling and I think he needs some individual counseling, he has a very, very unhealthy family dynamic. He needs to realize he does not OWE these people anything and he sure as hell does not need them in his life. ",
            "I think your fiance needs to make a choice.  Marry you and have no contact with his family, or bow out of the wedding and take up the role of breadwinner for his sisters.  He seems to have spent his life being the whipped puppy of the family so it is probably a hard call for him to make.",
            "This entire process sounds like a group of teenagers. Fuck his sisters. Bottom line. I wouldn't explain shit, prove shit, show shit, or give a damn about their childish behaviour. I wouldn't be friends on social media with them to be blocked by them. I wouldn't mention his sisters again. Wouldn't invite them to my wedding, much less care of they came; I would act as if these chics do not exist. Let them dig their own graves.

            "All I can say is wow. When people accuse people of something like this it usually means they are the ones committing the act. She's accusing you of being a gold digger while in all actuality it's her and her sister. The whole family seems corrupt. And honestly, I think your fianc\u00e9 needs to take a stand for himself against his family and the way they are treating the both of you. It is his parents fault for the way they were raised and his sisters fault for being complete assholes as to why turned out the way they are now and why can't be dealt with now. They're toxic and I feel like they will hurt your relationship. Michael really needs to tell his family how he feels personally. And if they're manipulative and rude about his feelings and try to minimize them in order to keep getting what they want then sadly maybe Michael needs to cut them out of his life? All I can say is if my family acted like this towards me and my significant other I would not tolerate it, they would be out of my life, family or not. It only makes them worse by the fact that they are using the word \"family\" as a tool to manipulate him showing that they don't really care. Also, why would you want to invite that kind of drama and immaturity into your lives? Posting on Facebook really? Obviously they are ignorant people who have been spoiled and only strived to pass in life and not truly succeed. They need to get out there and work for themselves. ",

If it were me, I'd tell them how it is, send them a letter or text (so they cant interrupt) detailing how he worked damn hard to earn a decent salary and put himself through college, while they lived off handouts off their parents and have never worked for anything in their lives before. Their parents gave them everything and him nothing, so why should he continue to enable them. They are not entitled to his money. They need to grow up and realise that they are not princesses any  more. They are adults that have to support themselves. It is important that everything that happens comes from your fiance however, and not you.\n  \n\n  \nPetty, non-serious part I'd do because I'm especially petty: if they wish to be treated like children, they can be. If they continue with this line of entitlement, he can start talking to them like they literally are children, talking to them in a baby voice. Buying them children's toys for their birthdays or offering to take them for ice cream. Anything you can think of that will demean them. \n  \nIt is important that whatever action you two decide to take, it is enforced by your fiance because anything done by you will demonize you to them.

Their gravy train is coming to an end, and they'll do pretty much anything to keep it moving.",

You willist grow a lot of resentment if Michael doesn't draw a LOT of hard boundaries now. I would tell him that he needs to tell them that he will give no one of them any money anymore, and then stand by what he says, because I couldn't be with someone who gives horrible people money instead of investing it into our future.

Nowhere because it's all a ploy for purely their own gain and that needs to be shoved right bag in their smug ridiculous faces.

If you can't agree on cutting off the sisters from any and all financial assistance, you should seriously reconsider this marriage. You are right, worrying about your lives and future is more important than the dredge of society these sisters represent. \n\nYou are 1,000% right that fiance needs to draw hard-lines and shut these two gold-diggers down or out for good. And really, any of his family that \"takes their side\" should be treated likewise and avoided or cut out completely. There is NO positive to come out of the lackadaisical, doormat attitude that your fiance is taking. If he can't do it on his own, he needs counseling to help him recognize what toxic beings these people are. They will make your life miserable. If he wants to avoid \"drama\" he needs to avoid them.\n\nI get that the sister blocked you, but you should also be blocking her so she doesn't control when she can \"unblock and harass.\"",
            "I think you and Michael should see a marriage counselor. You definitely need to be on the same page financially before getting married. And he ought to be taking \"Disrespecting my future wife is disrespecting me, and I will not tolerate it\" stance with his family rather than the path of least drama for himself. The things Tina has said about you are far more than enough grounds for Michael to go completely no contact with her. Tina is actively trying to break up your engagement, for Christ's sake. Maybe it would be good for Michael to see a therapist individually so he can hear from an independent party that his sister's behavior is worse than a street heckler and so he can work on what happen during his childhood and his guilt about helping them.",

No invitation to your wedding, no visits, no social media interactions. Your life is going to be so much better without them.\n\n\nHowever, your fiance need to understand that he should not support them financially. They are responsible for their financial situation, not Michael. Once you get married, there will be no \"his\" money, so all significant financial decisions should be agreed by both of you. I doubt you would agree to send any money to his sisters. You need to discuss it now and, probably, have a therapist to help.",

It's never been a problem here, and frankly they're all being little children. \n\nSo in conclusion: Your Michael needs to tell his sisters to get their shit together and stay the fuck away, until they've learned to treat both you and him with respect. The bank is closed. Furthermore, he needs to talk to his parents and tell them that they either show you some decency or they won't see much of you, him or their future grandchildren. Harsh? Perhaps.

He's likely said yes to avoid whatever conflict they throw at him. He has a right to say no. And it's not his fault if they get mad.

He must be very strong to survive childhood and find himself work and life to escape it bit by bit. \n\nThis might sound familiar (from mens advice line, a domestic abuse site for male victims)\n\n>What is domestic violence?\n\n>Domestic violence includes a range of behaviours: physical, psychological, sexual or financial abuse. It happens within intimate relationships as well as between family members. It forms a pattern of bullying and controlling behaviours. It is rarely a one-off event and it tends to get worse over time. Abusers can be very manipulative in the way they use their power and control over you and may blame you and other factors for their abusive behaviours.\n\n>How do you know you are abused by your partner?\n\n>If you are forced to change the way you behave because you are frightened of your partner's reaction, it is likely you are  being abused. If you feel afraid, walking on eggshells, intimidated by your partner, it is likely you are being abused. If there is conflict in your relationship and your partner hurts you (physically, emotionally etc) it is likely you are being abused.",

So if you want lined drawn you're gonna have to draw them yourself. And once he sees that you aren't gonna take their shit...maybe he will follow your lead.

(Marriage counseling would be a big help- maybe you guys are amazing together but families can drive a wedge and a professional can help you find direction in dealing with this in the healthiest manner)\n\nFirstly, if your SO doesn't want to completely cut his family out I suggest you support him in that decision not to.  However in return he must respect certain guidelines that are important to you.  Tit for tat, compromise, and all that.\n\nHis sisters absolutely have zero business knowing any details about your ring.  Zero.  Do not cave or give in on this.  They are asserting themselves and if they find they can cross this boundary it will encourage them to cross more.  \n\nIt is absolutely on him to *not* give in and tell them behind your back as well.  You want to marry him, not his sisters.  If he's not willing to cut them out of his life he's is expected to tell them No when they try to cut into yours. \n\nI'd highly recommend you both not borrow them anymore money as they obviously feel entitled to it instead of being appreciative, they have zero business knowing or benefiting from your earnings, and it will enable them to further ask for more and more and more.\n\nMoney and finance talk should be strictly prohibited with the both of them and you can discuss and agree apon a generous but not outlandish dollar allowance for birthday and Christmas gifts to them.\n\nIt is important that your husband know you are on his side but that these sort of topics are important because his sisters are decidedly not on your side.  That you are not attacking him or making him choose but making sure the both of you are not steamrolled.  You didn't sign up for this so you want to adapt to make sure you both are on the same page.\n\nBoundaries and respect is something that should be expected *more so* from family, not less.  The word family is not an excuse to take advantage of and disrespect each other.  They don't give a shit about what family really means, only that they benefit from it.  He'd never do this to them.  You'd never do this to them and so you both are undeserving of having it done to you.\n\nGiving in, placating, giving them what they want to shut them up seems easier but it is absolutely a surefire way of putting a giant wedge into your relationship and happiness.  Make absolutely sure both of you are able to say No as a complete sentence or you're in for a not so fun ride.  If you don't believe me go check out r/JustNoFamily and r/JustNoMil.  Family can ruin relationships and they shouldn't get a free pass to do so because of filial ties.\n\nInvite your fiance to read some of these comments together if you haven't already.  It will allow him to understand you aren't out to attack him (coming under scrutiny by a spouse can result in the other getting defensive and that doesn't help the situation).  It's important that you both work as a team and not against each other.\n\nMuch luck to you and congrats on your engagement!",

I was raised to believe that when young people reach a certain age, they marry and become each other's family and priority.

She and her sister sound like horribly spoiled woman-babies and it is obvious they are jealous of how successful and hardworking you and Michael are. \n\nBut, like, why is the engagement ring such a big deal? This is what I don't understand. She can't marry her brother. \n\nYou are well within your right to tell Michael that you aren't okay with him giving his sisters money.

As Michael becomes stronger, his bullies become weaker. If he has a support system (you) he is more likely to say \"no\" to them. Now, the sisters' attempts to drive you away have gone a bit far, creating a situation where he must choose between you and his sisters. And he *must* choose, because no self-respecting woman would settle for a man who lets his family treat her like garbage.

You'll maybe see them once a year. \n\nHere's my advice:\n\n1. Ask Michael to stop showing you the FB posts. That's doing nothing but sowing bad seeds. They're HIS sisters. He has the history and the patience to put up with their antics. You don't. If he wants to keep the peace, he should stop telling about their idiotic rhetoric. \n\n2. Don't make him cut out his family. This will very likely cause resentment. An ultimatum is never a good way to start a marriage. \n\n3. Don't be bothered by his stupid sisters.

I don't talk to, visit, send money to or interact with my middle sister, my aunts, uncles or cousins. I learned that sometimes family isn't always blood, and my husband has taught me (cause he stopped talking to his family too) that husband and wife ARE the only family you need to worry about,  and eventually the children.

You get to have a great big beautiful stone without going into hardly any debt and if you are a science nerd like me the fact that it is grown in a lab makes it even more enticing. I only wish you would stop calling it a fake. It is a real Moissanite and I think you should not be apologizing for it.

Now convincing your fianc\u00e9 of this is your real challenge. When I was reading your post, even before I got to the actual current conflict I was thinking he should walk away from those leeches. He has been taking care of himself since he was a young teenager and seems to be doing a good job of it. How you convince him to do this is going to be hard since they have brainwashed him into believing that family trumps all even when that same family is shallow, spoiled and didn't have the gumption to make anything out of themselves. In this day and age to see two young women behaving like they were raised in the middle of last century is laughable. They didn't care to get an education in order to be self reliant. That is definitely not you or your fianc\u00e9's problem. Good luck with getting him to realize that fact. I hope you can though because if you can't I wouldn't give you any great hopes that this problem is going away and you might just have a rough time going forward which is no way to start your new life together.

If they won't stop it he needs to walk away from the bullshit.\n\nI highly suggest going to couples' counseling with a \"leave and cleave\" counselor to help stiffen his spine before you two get married.  it might help if he hears the same thing  you're saying from an expert.\n\n",

If you can find a way to lovingly support your soon to be husband in going low contact while he does some recovery work you can set yourself up for a great marriage.

You don't need that on your wedding day. \n\nMichael needs to stop enabling his sisters by giving them money.  What he has he earned himself.   You need to sit Michael down, and have a serious talk about his family, his sisters behavior, and how this can impact your married life together.   You should also keep all your finances separate from Michael until he gets his act together with his leeching family.   A woman should do that anyway, because with 50% of marriages ending in divorce, a woman should always protect herself in case things go badly some years later.  \n  \n I would cut them off, and out of your lives aftef the wedding.   You can do this,  because you live far enough away from them.  ",
            "You're marrying Your fianc\u00e9e not them. Tell your fianc\u00e9e that this is not normal behaviour and where are his parents in all this? Tell the parents to control \" the step sisters\" yup that's what they sound like Cinderella's step sisters!. Your fianc\u00e9e has to make it clear to his parents and his sister's fianc\u00e9e that it is not his responsibility to financially support any of them. If the parents want to deal with spoiled brats let them but you and fianc\u00e9e don't have to. Fianc\u00e9e is embarrassed by his family hence him not making you meet them. He needs to cut them off.",

            "Premarital counseling might be a good place to talk through all of this. In mine, we had to look for relationship patterns so as not to repeat them in our marriage. If it's a premarital counseling program than there is usually a financial section, which would open the conversation for if you will support family and under what circumstances. ",
            "He should be thinking about his family. He should be thinking about how giving them money is enabling them to goof off in life.  Until they have to take care of themselves they will never learn and get their crap together.",

            ">How can I handle this situation?\n\nThis seems more like something Michael has to do, you can help support him, but it's his family that he'll have to potentially cut off.\n\n>She sent out a mass email to the whole family and announced that her and Hannah will not be attending my wedding nor supporting Michaels marriage to me \n\nAt least they set up the ground work for you. \n\n>but when I talked to him about cutting his family off for good he seemed hesitant.\n\nWell that's a normal reaction, to not want to do it straight away. If he just needs some help convincing himself, you could show him this thread.",
            "I thought there was a problem until I read they won't be attending the wedding or won't be affiliated with your marriage.  Perfect.

            "Do not engage with these monsters. Don't respond,....just nothing. How are the finances budgeted in you house? Is your money pooled, separate, or a combination of both? I would have a conversation with you husband letting him know that you are not ok spending any pooled money, or your money on his sisters. Let him use his personal funds for whatever he wants, if that is his sisters so be it. \n\ni would wait to feel out the whole wedding invite situation until you are a little bit closer to the date. if you see them in the mean time, you can say hello, but just walk away if the begin a conversation, stay close to either your husband or someone you trust. IGNORE, IGNORE, IGNORE, do not engage.\n\nWhen you talk to your husband about what is going on, i would advise against things such as \"suggesting\" that he cut off his family. That is something that someone should come to their own conclusion about. What you can do is tell him what you will not be tolerating, if that means that you will not be attending social events, so be it. \n\nLastly, don't throw away a potential relationship with his parents just because the sisters are animals. I'm not saying you should force the relationship, or try to prove yourself, but maybe have them over for dinner, or just try to carve out some low key time for the 4 of you to get to know one another better.\n\n",
            "This has a Cinderella feel to it only your fianc\u00e9 is the male Cinderella and they are like the evil step sisters fighting about a ring instead of a shoe, no wonder he lives in another state. You need to set some boundaries with Michael now on what you will and will not put up with as far as their concerned, especially about loaning/giving them any money. You can't start a new marriage like that. Good luck :)",
            "I think it would be in your best interest to distance yourself from his family and him distance himself as well. He doesn't owe them so much as the one of day. His family treats him as the scapegoat and his sisters always had everything they wanted. As a result they think the world owes them just as much. Spoiler alert: it doesn't. The world won't and doesn't coddle anyone. So in her still childish mind she thinks the world owes her a bigger ring, owes her money, owes her time. Simply for existing. She hasn't been a good sister and it doesn't seem like she's been a good person either. Neither of his sisters seem to e good people. Rest assure that this isn't about you. This is about their own issues that have been deep rooted in their family since before you and possibly even before the sisters or your fianc\u00e9 were even born. His parents seem to be the root of this evil. Your fianc\u00e9 has always been their scapegoat and you're a part of the package deal unfortunately. But who would want such people at your wedding anyways? You go on and live your life. Their selfish ways do not have to affect you. They have been that way since before you got there. You owe them nothing and assure your fianc\u00e9 he doesn't either. He doesn't need to give in and neither do you. Let them spout names and insults at you. Just know their issues aren't with you. You go on and have your beautiful wedding and you work your ASS off for this future. His sisters don't deserve anything. They don't even deserve the satisfaction of knowing it affects you. ",
            "Good on you guys for getting a moissanite ring. Why start a marriage off with debt? We did the same and have spent the last 10 years saving and making good financial decisions so we can retire in the next 10 years. Don't let all these people and their jealousy ruin your  mood.",
            "I don't know that it's necessarily a good idea to cut contact with his family completely, because eventually they may just use that as a validation of their own feelings i.e. \"See! She got him to cut us off completely.\" I'd say just discuss with your SO the limits you have and how the problems will be handled, such as no money being given to them, no prolonged visits to their house, etc. ",
            "You do nothing. ABSOLUTLEY nothing. This is Michael's family and michael's problem. Michael needs to put his sisters in their place and explain that they need to grow up. Michael needs to make a stand to his family and defend you. \n\n\nIf Michael can't or won't do these things, you may want to postpone the wedding. ",
            "Please have your fiance read your post and these responses. Sometimes it's hard to wrap your head around a problem until it's written out in a clear and succinct name such as your post.\n\nThe comments and advice provided will help him realize that yes his wife is correct, that his family is a bunch of narcissistice assholes.\n\nAlso other posters mentioned JADE'ing. Please both of you research it, memorize it, and work on never doing it again. You are each others family now. Those people are now his EXTENDED family. He needs to realize that they literally have no say, no true importance, are only effecting him negatively at this point, and he can actually live without them and their bullshit and be just fine, in fact, happier. ",
            "wow she is publicly humiliating you and he still gives her money??? Shouldnt you reconsider if this is the right time to permanently involve them in your life? I think you need to reconsider this engagement and maybe hold off the wedding until this gets sorted out. You have to think about how he is treating you by not doing anything. Hes essentially siding with them by not protecting you from this craziness. This is absolute madness whats happening here. And very very unsavory. ",
            "It's time to avoid contact with his family. If he wants to visit, sure, his parents are his parents, but there is no reason for you to go when you know you will just be disrespected. There's nothing saying that the sisters may grow up one day and maybe you could try having a relationship then, but you've already put up with more than most people would. We can't choose our family but we can choose how much we interact with them. ",
            "Michael's parents created these awful leeching monsters and they should be the ones to deal with it. It's not his job or responsibility to take care of them. Maybe their parents should have taught the girls the value of hard work? You guys don't owe them anything. Blacklist them from the wedding and enjoy yourselves. They will only bring drama and will most certainly try to ruin your day.",

            "Your fianc\u00e9 doesn't want to cut off him family. Ask him to not show you their social media, and work in developing thicker skin. Since they don't live near you and ate not part of your daily lives this should be easy. Any nurse deals with far more difficult people every day.\n\nWhen you visit ignore most of what they say and continue to leave for the hotel when you've had enough.",
            "I wouldn't force your husband to cut his family off completely. It's his family and just because they're horrible people doesn't mean that you should make him have no contact with his family. It has to be HIS choice. Not yours. Otherwise it will build resentment between the two of you.\n\nI would suggest creating a letter to them together and expressing how sad it is that they will not be attending the wedding but it is ultimately their choice and that you respect their decision. Just kill them with kindness. Don't feed the flame and just let them have their crazy over there, away from you. I have crazy in laws as well. I handle them like this and it works because they can hate you from afar and just smile and ignore when you have to be near them. ",
            "Congratulations on your engagement!\n\nMichael sounds great. His family sounds shitty. You'll never make them not shitty, but you can put up boundaries. Have a very serious conversation with your fiancee. It's OK to express these concerns.\n\nAlso, if it were me, a significant flavor of this conversation would be something along the lines of, \"Michael, I respect your past and your family, but if I am to marry you, I need to know I come first. I'm not comfortable with your family looking to us for financial dependency. It's OK for you to help them, but if I'm going to be your partner, I need to see you enact some boundaries with them so that our relationship is protected and can grow. We're not even married yet and your family is putting pressure and conditions on our relationship. I need you to address this if we are to have a healthy, continued relationship.\"",
            "I think asking him to cut his family off is a little too much to ask. Do they deserve it? Yes. However, it's a HUGE deal to completely sever ties with your family, and you should not expect him to do it just because you want him to. He needs to decide for himself that cutting them off is right for him. \n\nYou've told him how you feel, and now it's time to let him work out the right thing to do on his own. Now is the time to do your best to be supportive, even though it's difficult. If you try to pressure him into cutting them off before he is ready, he will only end up resenting you. He's already taken steps to stick up for you, and he's not just doing nothing at all while they abuse you. Give him time. Overcoming a lifetime of conditioning from a family like that is extremely difficult. He's not going to just magically do it one day because you want him to. As long as he's trying his best, that's all you can ask. \n\nWhat you can do is let him know that *you* want nothing to do with them. It is not unreasonable for him to do what's in his power to prevent you from having to interact with the sisters. However, you can't hold him responsible if they pull some kind of shady shit to get around his efforts to keep them away from you. People like his sisters are really good at being manipulative. \n\nIt is none of their business whether your ring is real or not. If he has decided to not give them money, then they just have to get over it. There's nothing wrong with a minimum wage job (I've had plenty myself) but if they're unable to support themselves on that and they're not even trying to get something better, then they have no right to get angry that no one else is willing to support them. \n\nIt's one thing when you're in school, or some sort of training, or trying to improve your situation, but doing as little as possible while expecting others to support you is ridiculous. There were times when  I had three jobs while I was in college. Yes I had help from family sometimes, but I busted my ass to improve my situation, and now I can fully support myself with a decent career. There is no excuse for people like your fiance's siblings. \n\nFinally, if you feel like all this is too much for you, then you might have to consider breaking up. Being married is about supporting each other through thick and thin, and if you honestly think you can't help him through his family situation for the rest of your life, then perhaps this is not the right marriage for you. There would be absolutely nothing wrong with ending it if you think that's what is in *your* best interest. ",
            "Get Michael to show her proof that the ring isn't real, and disinvite her to the wedding if she changes her mind about coming. If I were you, I'd avoid her at all costs. This could be harder for Micheal though, as they are family. He should at the very least put some boundaries up.",
            "It's definitely not classy but you might agree to show her the valuation, meet up with her, hand her an envelope and walk away immediately. Beforehand stuff the envelope with a piece of paper saying \"Fuck you\".\n\nIn all seriousness however, yes, Michael will have to set boundaries. I'm really sorry he has a family that never seemed to value him beyond any financial gain he brought to the family. I don't think going No Contact is easy so you just have to agree on how to communicate with his family on your both's terms (yours and Michael's) - like which mode of communication you are available through, who to contact & whether you both formulate replies together/listen in to the conversation at the same time etc. Definitely don't give in to their whims though, that's just reaffirming what the SILs expected from their school days",
            "He either cuts them out or you walk and they can have your engagement ring. I don't know why people put up with this kind of drama. Your fiance is a door mat and after the way he was treated as a kid it should be a no brainer. If he can't stand up for himself and you I wouldn't stick around. Your whole life will revolve around this chaos. And him giving them money? I'd be furious if he kept doing that after being engaged/married. Enough is enough. His parents aren't paying for the sisters anymore because they know your fiance is a gullible fool who will do it for them.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Everyone has crazy in laws. It's practically a requirement. In all seriousness though, other than having a conversation with your fiance about the level of contact he expects to have with his family and making sure you guys come to an understanding regarding giving money to them, this doesn't sound like that big a deal.",
            "\"she made a grab for my left hand\"  OK- So she kind of assaulted you.  Next time dial 911. Warn Michael that this could happen. You are off limits. "

        "selftext": "[My post from 1.5 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ry76x/my_27f_brother_32m_is_out_of_prison_after_10/)\n\nI remembered posting here, and decided to give an update after 1.5 years.\n\nTLDR of last post: Brother did crimes which got him sent to prison and that was the start of a chain that destroyed our family and left my parents dead. He's out now. Not sure if I should start contact.\n\nI decided to go and see him. I talked to my uncle first and he told me that my brother is acting great, doing good work and is being very reasonable about everything. He also said he's asked about me but kept his distance out of respect, since I stopped visiting him in prison.\n\nWhen I met him it wasn't easy. I had some unresolved feelings and I ended up shouting at him a little, but also eventually ended up crying in his arms. We talked for hours and hours that day. The more we talked the more I realized how much I missed him and having him in my life, and also how little I knew about our parents. They were horrible to him, really abusive.\n\nOur father used to hit him. I remember him crying in his room sometimes. I always teased him and mocked him for it. I was a lot younger and didn't know what was going on, but I have vague memories that I mostly hurried but now they made a lot of sense. I even remember our dad went to his room with a belt. My mom told me he wanted to see if it fits on my brother's pants. I was 12 I think. I believed it and ever thought twice. No wonder he was acting out and was troubled. I know it doesn't excuse what he did that left him in prison but it adds some context.\n\nWhen I visited him in prison early on, he would always ask me if our parents are treating me well. They were to be fair, they never abused me. Or if they did I don't remember. I thought he was trying to badmouth them but he was worried about me. He apologized to me that his stupid mistake ended up separating us because he had promised himself to keep me safe and to help me when I turn 18.\n\nOur grandma confirmed the abuse as well when I talked to her. She knew about it and did nothing. She told me my mom didn't kill her self because of what my brother did or my dad's repulse, it was over guilt for not doing anything to end the abuse that my brother suffered for years. My view of my parents have changed completely. \n\nTo make it short, we decided to restart our family with a clean slate. We promised to love each other and take care of each other. We've both been to therapy as well. We missed a lot of years but we have a lot of time ahead of us. \n\nIt's so good to have a family again! I've had friends in these times but never had someone who knew everything about me. Someone I could trust and always rely on. And being that person to someone else. Now I have that and it's amazing. We talk on most days and see each other at least once a week. He's still working in the farm with our uncle and is doing a good job. But I convinced him to go back to college and get his degree. He began this semester. He's also staying away from alcohol completely and I'm doing the same. Both our parents had an alcohol problem and he did something horrible while drunk and our uncle has also been having DUIs, people in our family should not be drinking. I never had a problem with alcohol but I think doing it together is just easier for him and me.\n\nSo overall, life is good. And I'm really hopeful for our future! Thanks for your help especially those who gave me the courage to step up and meet him. \n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Met with brother. Realized there were more going on that I knew. We made our peace and now 1.5 years later life is great! ",

            "Probably one of the greatest updates I've ever read! But I do have a bias for sibling bonds. I have always felt a very genuine sympathy for those who have had to go thru life without a sibling. When my parents went through an abrupt and eventually pretty nasty divorce, it totally shattered our family. But on the other end, it made my sibling and I so much closer and they are my best friends. Finding out your parents have done terrible things feels like you've been fooled, you're childhood was a lie, your foundation of your life is gone - but what was worst was the grief. You don't simply feel betrayed, you feel like someone you love has died and in many ways that is true. The parents you thought you knew no longer exist, and who knows? Maybe they never existed at all. The mutual love within our home and family was just tossed out like garbage. My parents were both so angry and devastated that they totally dropped the ball for a few years. Me being the oldest and only 17 at the time, I knew I had to keep us a United front. \n\nOur philosophy has always been that your parents may fail you, your family may fall apart, everything you once knew and took for granted could be over tomorrow - except for us. We cannot and will not divorce our siblings, that's the true family.",
            "This was such a sweet (albeit very heartbreaking to read what you and brother went through) update!\n\nVery happy for you guys to get a chance at a fresh relationship!"

Graig is getting ready for work and Shelby is actually taking a nap in our guest room since she drove most of the night. \n\nThe trip went very well and they both had a great time. As for me being insecure, Graig did everything I asked of him to reassure me that there was nothing at all inappropriate going on. He called multiple times a day and we skyped for maybe 15-20 minutes a night almost every night. I got a good idea of the room lay out and saw that even though they were sharing a suite, they both had plenty of privacy. \n\nI did have one moment early on where the reality of my husband sharing a hotel room with an Instagram model in her 20s sort took my breath away but it wasn't Shelbys faullt. Me and our 9 year old son were on Skype with my husband and I saw Shelby in the background wearing a swimsuit getting ready to go to the hottub. When she realized my son was on skype (they have a very playful, almost \"flirty\" relationship) she leaned over my husbands shoulder and said something like \"Hey AJ, I'm going to destroy you in HALO when I get back.\" But her boobs were basically right on graig's shoulder with her ample cleavage in full view. In my brain I was thinking \"buster if your eyes so much as look left...it's over.\" But Graig didn't even flinch which made me realize that to him seeing Shelby in a bikini really is like seeing his sister or cousin.\n\nSo all in all they had a great time. Graig has since left for work and I'm sure I'll chat more with Shelby when she wakes up for her drive across town. \n\nAs for me I've spent the last two weeks really dedicating my self to lose weight, get healthy and be passionate about something again. I've signed up for a 60 day challenge at our local hot yoga studio and have been going every day. I've started using myfitnesspal to count calories (I'm astonished at how much I was actually mindlessly eating for years). And in two weeks I've lost just under 5lbs which makes me feel really great.\n\n\n**tl;dr**: husband just got back from his ski trip with his young family friend. I was super insecure about but it turns out it was a good experience for them and hopefully a transformative experience for me\n\n\nEdit (about 1230 original post was at 7am) I had no idea this would blow up again but thank you again. Shelby just left to go to her apartment after we sat and chatted a bit. She is an amazing girl and I get zero hint that anything went on (just adding this for the people who think she and Graig are shady). She was so appreciative and she's going to baby sit for us whenever we need it and do a girls day at a spa in Denver with me when the ski season is over and her weekends free up.\n\nWhat's crazy is how this and my last posts comments are so split down the middle. To just answer the most common questions comments:\n\n1. I was really kidding about him looking at Shelbys bikini...if he looked he looked but it was still a little shocking to see another woman's more intimate parts so close to my husband. The hot tub pool was for the entire hotel so as far as I know they were never there alone, at least for very long. I should add that Shelby had a towell around her waist.\n\n2. I didn't go or have the option to go because we have kids in school and Graig booked this trip last summer. They were leaving Sunday and his friend cancelled Friday so it was far to late to make two week child care plans. He asked Shelby (as opposed to other people from that group of friends) because she's the only one really on his level of skiing. \n\n3. Upgrading to the suite cost me $50 a night extra and...which was not cheap but trying to get two rooms would have been $450 a night extra. This was the best compromise I could come up with. \n\n4. I'm still insecure but I'm working on it. I'm not sure if I need therapy or need to just get something in my life other than kids/husband to look forward to. I was in quite a rut. The hot yoga has really helped because it's challenging and I've made new friends. \n\nThank you again for all the comments...the positive and the negative. I'm not a great writer so the people who like how I handled this will continue to and the people that didn't like what I did won't--just trust I handled this the best way I knew how.\n\nTo the guys asking for Shelbys Instagram...funny but no.",

            "Good for you. From Personal experience, I can tell you that the children of close friends, especially old family friends, can become like family. You have seen them from being a newborn, and as they have gone through childhood.   \n\nSometimes it can be hard to see them as anything but the cute kid that ran around in diapers. They may have grown into an \"instagram model\", but you still remember them as the kid who fell asleep at the kitchen table, while visiting with their parents.   ",

I like the implication that this dude would just fuck his \"like a sister\" family friend.\n\nIf someone implied that I was going to bang someone that I saw as a sister, I probably wouldn't talk that that person again.  The fact that this implication came from his wife is absurd.  This was all about her insecurities. \n\nI spent the weekend at a cabin with some old friends.  It was a last minute invite, and my wife, knowing she wouldn't be able to go because we didn't have someone to watch our dog, encouraged me to go up because I hadn't seen these people in a long time.\n\nIt was a group, and there were women present.  In fact, I had a bunch of beers while sitting in a hot tub occupied by myself and three other women.  According to this sub, I should have been a cheating machine because, you know, I'm not an adult person in a committed relationship who has a modicum of self control.\n\nThe people still freaking out about this guy going up with a family friend are probably projecting their own experiences/trust issues into this conversation.\n\nWe should start requiring people to have flair regarding their relationship statuses.  It might cut down on all the double-standards and projection that permeates these comments.",

I'm so relieved and you guys are way smarter than me.  \n\nShe came home from work last night and I told her I needed to ask her something, could we sit down and talk.  She looked worried but agreed right away and asked me what was wrong.  I told her I had read her message and asked her to please explain it to me.  Comprehension washed over her face and then a look of pity.  She said she had joined the gym down the street because her work gym is terrible, and she signed up for a personal trainer because they were having a deal and she wanted to be held accountable.  She showed me her sign up sheets and keycard and even pulled up the gym website and showed me her little calendar spots for her training sessions with her personal trainer, whose name is of course Jeff.\n\nShe apologized profusely and said she didn't mean to scare me.  I asked her why she hadn't said anything and she said it was because she wanted to make some progress first, which honestly, is very much like her.  When she's trying to do a project she does not like to draw attention to it until it's done.  I think that \"ta-da\" moment motivates her.\n\nSo everything is ok because I asked her what was up.

I've been dumped or parted ways mutually but ... I summoned up all my courage and called BF to meet up. \n\nTo those of you who warned me to be prepared for gaslighting...you were spot-on. Thank you for the warning.\n\nI told him I was tired of being pimped at home, tired of arguing about whether it was appropriate for him to pimp me at home, and that I'd spent far too much time fighting him over the issue. I told him while the questions were annoying as all hell, the fact that I'd repeatedly explained to him that it was stressful for me yet he continually disregarded that and tried to shame me into doubting myself was the bigger problem, and that his lack of respect for my comfort was a dealbreaker.\n\nHe informed me that:\n\n1. He knew this was coming because I've always been an intellectual snob and his family had warned him about me from day 1.\n\n2. He'd been wanting to dump me for months but he knew I needed his support throughout med school so he couldn't leave. Because he's a good guy and he would have felt so bad abandoning me.\n\n3. Everyone in medicine either suffers from narcissism, autism, or OCD, so he's glad he doesn't have to interact with me or any of my friends anymore.\n\n4. Law school is harder than medical school, lawyers are smarter than doctors, and he will always be needed but I'll be replaced soon by Watson.\n\n5. He wishes me luck dying alone and becoming one of those sad lonely old lady doctors who has to resort to banging my residents for sexual relief.\n\nMy mind is fucking blown. I went home and cried and threw up. What the fuck piece of shit did I fall in love with???? I've never seen that side of him. I'd seen anger but not .... that. I don't know guys. I'm overwhelmed. I really thought when I posted the original question that there'd be more of a debate. Like expected some people to say oh he's just curious it's innocent, and expected to find some people be like tell this dude to STFU. I was really blown away by all of you being able to identify and verbalize and validate what had been feeling so goddamn confusing and shitty over here.\n\nHasn't been the most productive study day, but I'm going to go try and get some work done and at least enjoy the peace and quiet.   \n\n**tl;dr**: Bf way more insecure than I imagined possible. Peaced out. **THX REDDIT <3 <3 <3**",

            "I'm experiencing formatting problems, so please be a bit forgiving. I took a while to think of what to respond, and came out with a long statement. I mean well, though. \n\n\nDon't waste another second's thought on this loser. Yes, that's what he is, a loser. I usually don't take the judgemental route, but it's right there, for all to see. He's jealous, because lawyers tend to have a bad stigma attached to them, while doctors spend their days saving lives. If it's ok, I'm going to have some fun dissecting his little temper tantrum.\n\n\n1.      He's jealous of your intelligence, girth of knowledge, and ability to use reason and method to prove a point or get work done. His family warned him that you were too smart for him, and that he likely couldn't keep up with you. In order to deal with that, he tried to dumb you down to his level, or try to learn small bits of what you spent a lot of time researching, in order to sound on your level. Second graders do that. \n\n2.      Any guy that refers to himself as a \"good guy/nice guy\" really isn't. They're just trying to convince themselves and the world around them that they have something of value to offer. These types usually have a massive ego and/or sense of entitlement, and end up with nothing to show for it in the end. If he really was amazing, he would have dumped you. He was trying to prove that you needed him, in order to convince himself of his own value. However, you became successful and retained your independence. This made him furious, because he couldn't \"save\" you, or make you look like a project that needed fixing. I've seen people in relationships act like this. He tries to make himself look like a hero in his own mind, in order to satisfy his own delusions of grandeur/hero complex/narcissism.\n\n3.      He's trying to justify the fact that his friends and colleagues are beginning to see him for what he truly is, and distancing themselves from him. It's noted that lawyers and corporate-types high in seniority tend to be the ones to suffer from alpha complexes and narcissism. It's the trait that makes them so successful. However, doctors tend to remain steadfast, professional, and hard working.\n\n4.     Both law school and medical school are likely very hard. However, both are trades, and are important to society as a whole. The difference is that lawyers are kind of a necessary evil. Many start with good intentions, but end up doing more harm than good. Being a good lawyer really means knowing how to argue the law in order to get a desired result, in order to give the client what they want. This isn't always the right thing, and not always the wrong thing. With doctors, their calling,  because that's what it is, a calling, is to save lives, and make a difference in thousands, if not millions of lives a year. If society was falling apart, doctors will be called on way before lawyers. \n\n5.     You can tell that he doesn't think much of you. He showed his hand in a big way, here. This is proof that you not being in the relationship is the right thing to do. The thing is, he's very wrong, and I'll tell you why. Doctors/nurses will always have a steady income, large intelligence, a strong will, dedication, large IQ, and often, a very pretty face/attractive look in scrubs. 9/10 guys I know would instantly go on a date with a female doctor/nurse at the mere mention, never even having met the person. I promise, you'll have tons of options, and will be saving tons of time and cash by keeping that needy, childish loser out of your life. \n\n     Keep working hard, staying strong, and saving lives. Keep the loser out of your thoughts, and do great things. Your value isn't defined by him, but by yourself and your actions. I'm not going to wish you luck, because I feel like you've likely got the tools to turn thought into action, which doesn't require luck. Enjoy life, be happy. ",

I personally know at least 15 people who studied law and, except for one guy who got into Harvard Law, all of them regret it. Most have not found law jobs even remotely related to their field. Six years on, they struggle to pay the bills. Those that actually got a lawyer job hate it. The Harvard guy got a good job he enjoys, but he's the outlier for sure.\n\nI got a job after college working for lawyers instead of going to law school right away, and that saved me.

So he worked out this whole narrative in his head where actually people who go to med school are stupid, and that the only reason you got into med school anyway was somehow because of his support and etc etc etc. \n\nIt sounds like that jealousy and insecurity ate him up so badly it might have changed him for the worse. Or perhaps he always was an asshole, this just brought it out of him?

Seriously laughed out loud when I read it.\n\nLaw school is not harder than medical school. Law school might be harder than med school *for some people*, and vice versa. But it's just silly to say that an academic course of study that lasts three years (in the US), and where the third year is widely considered a joke, is harder than a four-year program followed by at least one residency. \n\nIt's also idiotic to say that lawyers are smarter than doctors. There are some lawyers who are smarter than some doctors, and some doctors who are smarter than some lawyers.\n\nFinally, the idea that \"he will always be needed but [you]'ll be replaced soon by Watson\"? Wrong to the point of deluded. All he'd need to do is spent 30 seconds googling \"legal job market\" to see plenty of doomsday predictions. The Bureau of Labor Statistics agrees, predicting that legal jobs will see about average growth (6%) through 2024, while jobs for physicians and surgeons will grow \"much faster than average\" (14%) over the same time period.\n\nFinally, pairing this:\n\n>He informed me that ...

People in this sub like buzzwords too much, and actual real life gaslighting just doesn't come along often enough to satisfy their need to use the word.\n\nIt's unfortunate that when someone comes for help trying to deal with actual gaslighting, the word won't have the gravity it deserves.",
