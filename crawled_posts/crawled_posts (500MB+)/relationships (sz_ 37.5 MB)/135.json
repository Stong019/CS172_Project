        "selftext": "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ph0tow/going_to_confess_my_23f_feelings_to_my_long_time/)\n\nI remember that someone asked about update and it is always nice to share good news! :)\n\nSo, TLDR is quite easy: I did confessed my feelings eventually and it looked like my friend shared similar feelings! We agreed to pomote our friendship and try this couples thingy. :)\n\nBut I almost messed this up in every possible way. We had dinner and for few hours I was not able to force myself to start this topic at all. We almost parted our ways but as we were talking in front of restaurant we figured out noone has better things to do on Friday evening this time. So we agreed to spend some more time together. We went to 2 other places to drink and dance a little and me being me - I still was not able to say anything. That was just heart breaking at this point.\n\nI had a last chance, he told me earlier about some projects he was working on so I asked if I could see it. We went to his place, had one more glass of wine and were chilling for a bit. At one point we were teasing one another (in a playful way) and messing around. He was tickling me and to make him stop I pinned him down. I have no idea what I was thinking at that time but I kissed him! I immidiately panicked and backed off and he was like - *what was that*? I was scared like hell, but I told him that we have this unique bond and for some time I was feeling like I would like something more and asked him if he could see us as a couple.\n\nHe told me that he really appreciates our friendships and trusts me a lot and then complimented me a little. But next thing he told me was really earth-shattering. Basically he didn't thought I might be into him romantically. He reminded me about one conversation we had. It was after my last breakup. I said something like there are no man I am really attracted to (which was straight up lie - I was attracted to him, just couldn't admit that) and because of that he was never thinking we could be a couple nor anything like that. I told him it was stupid thing to say then and I am attracted to him.\n\nSo yeah he proposed for us to try this and we kissed. I felt so happy and relieved and I started crying a little. But he was really comforting about it. And then one thing led to another and hmm.. I was really great end of the day and all.\n\nSo long story short - we are meeting today again for a real date. It will be a little bit weird as we already have trust and intimacy (from our friendship) that is usually build during dating. But it is nice to try it. I cannot wait - I think I was never so happy!",

            "So you go to dinner, dancing, wine, tickling each other at his place alone, and he still didn't have the idea that you might be into him because you said something about men in general right after a breakup?\n\nLadies, we men need your help. If you are into us, let us know. Even private wine tickling at his place isn't enough to get it through our heads.",
            "This reminds me of me and my now husband a bit. I had a crush on him since middle school and he had no clue I existed lol. Then we were in the same club in high school and became friends but we both dated around and all. My senior prom after a breakup I asked  him to be my date and he said yes. We are on the dance floor getting really into it and really close and I KISSES HIM!!\n\nClearly though it worked cuz we had our 10 year dating anniversary in April and one year wedding anniversary in June. \n\nI\u2019ve always loved and appreciated that we were friends for a long while first before dating. I already knew him but I got to know like ALLL of him. It\u2019s hard to describe but because I already trusted him and could talk to him it just made our relationship so much more freeing and personal. I don\u2019t know, but CONGRATS!!",

            "We can be pretty clueless - I know I was when I was younger (yeah like I'm not anymore now right haha).  I am sure he appreciates you letting him know.  I am pretty sure I was in similar situations back then and no one spoke up.\n\nThere was one gal who was a great friend of mine, we hung out a lot in college.  We parted ways awhile when she got married but she reached back out after they split.  We then would spent a lot of time together.  She and I were both interested in paranormal, psychics, spirituality etc.  I remember one day I had a dream where I was at my own wedding in the future but I could not tell who the person was.  I snuck a peak at the card and coudln't recall the name after waking up but remembered it was someone who I already knew (i.e. it wasn't someone who I had yet to meet).  We were having dinner at my place later that day and I told her the dream and she believed it.  She said a few times \"It's not me is it?\"  \"You don't think it is me?\"  I took that at face value that she would never want anything like that (and that still may have been the right interpretation), but I decades later still wonder.  Of course I could have just asked her at that moment, right?  But like I said we can be clueless haha\n\nGreat job and I wish for the best for you OP and your bf!",

After a breakup is a tricky time for men if they are into you, because they want to console you, but they might also be listening for when is the best time to swoop in and be your next.

This takes TIME, it is someone you build trust with, communication, common goals, common values, someone you consider to be physically attractive and a strong friendship, someone you just want to hang with. This is all before sex because that covers up incompatibility in the other things I mentioned first\n\nYour friendship is great and this is a solid start to a very good relationship, you have taken time to build all this first before real intimacy and that makes it very special.\n\nI wish you true deep love, a profound and deep trust and companionship for life.",

She rejected me, I had admitted my feelings and told her not to feel pressured to return them, that I understood if she didn't feel the same. So even though it hurt, I was glad she was honest. \n\nUnfortunately I had made an oversight and she began to react differently around me, her mannerisms changed when I was present and it felt like she avoided me sometimes. We shared the same friend group and her disappearance was noted, I didn't mention it since my other friends didn't know about the crush I had developed. \n\nAnd well, I lost a friend there. I do regret that, but I knew if I kept my feelings to myself it would make the pain worse when she would date other people, and it would make it hard for me to be exposed to that. I made what I felt was the right call, and I don't regret it in the end. Okay, a little bit but still \ud83d\ude06 it had to happen. \n\nI guess what I am saying is, I'm glad this worked out for you two.

We didn't want to cross any boundaries and risk our friendship, even though our mutual friends AND HER EX-HUSBAND were pushing us both to date after she got divorced(I had already been divorced a few years from a cheating wife). But I threw caution in the wind and asked her out. We had a great time...and she ended up making the first \"official\" move to escalate the intimacy after I had put my arm around her and my hand brushed the back of her neck shooting electricity from her neck to her toes. Neither of us saw it coming with the chemistry and we were inseparable ever since...been together now 16 years/15 of them married. She is my best friend, lover, partner, equal, and my rock.",

        "selftext": "My husband is annoyed because I've decided not to attend Friendsgiving. It's a tradition among our friends and we've participated in the past but this year I'm not up for it. \n\nThe main reason is that our son is only five weeks-old. I'm pretty much recovered physically from my c-section but my mind and body are still **tired**. Our pediatrician said it's important to make sure people wash their hands before touching him because we're entering cold & flu season. I don't want to have to worry about it all night or be \"that mom\" reminding everybody to wash their hands. \n\nThere are other, less significant, reasons too. Most of our friends don't have kids yet. I can't/don't want to drink alcohol, which is always a major part of our Friendsgiving. Being the only sober person by the end of the night will definitely be annoying. The couple hosting this year also have two dogs and three cats, the house is covered in pet hair and the animals climb all over people and the furniture. It's uncomfortable for me because I'm allergic to cats and I don't care for animals climbing on and/or licking me. I wouldn't be happy if one of the pets was all over the baby and it's possible he has allergies too.\n\n**I just don't want to go.**\n\nDuring my pregnancy my husband frequently reminded me he didn't want the baby to change everything or become the center of our lives (lol). I believe this is why he's annoyed about Friendsgiving. We got into an argument earlier and I brought this up, I told him he's being unrealistic, which apparently really bothered him. I told him he can do whatever he wants but I'm staying home. I have no desire to attend this year and I think he could try harder to have some empathy, I just had a baby FFS. He's so paranoid about our lives *god forbid* changing that he's failing to recognize he's being inconsiderate and causing me to feel some resentment towards him.\n\nI love my husband and I don't like feeling this way about him. I don't know what to do here. I understand his concerns but holy shit, he needs to back off, our son is **five weeks old**. \n\nDo you think I'm wrong to want to stay home? \n\nHow can I help him see this from my perspective? I want to spend Saturday night relaxing at home, snuggling with my baby, and maybe preparing for actual Thanksgiving. Socializing is the farthest thing from my mind and actually sounds overwhelming and stressful. But he doesn't see it this way. It's all about me being a boring mom now and not trying hard enough to be the 'cool' wife/mom/friend. \n\n**Update**: We talked a little last night when he came home. I acknowledged his feelings and concerns and assured him I think they're completely valid. However, the way he communicates with me on this issue needs to change (and he agreed). I told him he's pushing me away and I'm growing resentful. I also mentioned how I'm afraid to be vulnerable with him because I worry he'll just criticize me. It was late so we didn't talk long but he seemed to understand. He apologized for being so hard on me about this and he said he didn't realize it was taking such a big toll on me. We'll definitely have more in-depth conversation about this soon. **Thank you for all of your help, reassurance, and kind words.**\n\nAlso, because people asked about these things:\n\n- I do take the baby out. I think fresh air is good for babies. I tend to avoid taking him to places indoors with a lot of people, though.\n\n- My husband is a good dad. He takes care of our son and spends time with him. He has him on a blanket in the backyard right now (doing tummy time).\n\n- Maintaining a social life is important to me. Being a mom is part of who I am now but it's one aspect of my life. Our son needs a lot of my time and attention and I *want* to give it to him. But that doesn't mean it will be like this forever. I don't think it's unreasonable to give a new mom time to enjoy loving on the baby and that doesn't mean that's all she'll ever want to do going forward. I actually said this to my husband last night and I could tell it resonated with him. \n\n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: My (very social) husband is annoyed with me because I am not attending Friendsgiving. Our baby is 5 weeks-old and I'm not feeling it. He thinks this is the beginning of the end and our social lives are doomed because I \"won't\" try harder to be social and outgoing. I spend time with friends and family regularly and believe his fears are misplaced. I also think it's unrealistic to think everything will stay the same after you have a baby.",

Five weeks after a c-section, you're barely at the point where you can lift more than the baby, and those post-partum hormones - even if they're not triggering depression etc - can be FIERCE.\n\nHe is being entirely unrealistic about recovery time post pregnancy, and even if you bounced back AMAZINGLY, entirely unrealistic about traveling with a newborn infant.

            "First of all, you are 100% right to stay home. I had both my kids right before Thanksgiving (3 years apart, but their birthdays land in the same week) and it was hard to do get togethers. I did go to Thanksgiving with my first because it was at my grandma's house which is very clean, has a quiet room with a crib downstairs and everyone in my family is very respectful of boundaries, I didn't have to worry about everyone trying to hold the baby ot anything. They just looked at him from a distance. \n\nAnyway, if I were you I would definitely not take your baby into that type of environment when he's that little. Maybe send a bouquet of fall flowers to the host with a little note saying that you hope they have fun and you'll miss them this year but look forward to seeing them next year? Sign it from you and baby and send it with your husband. They will totally understand. \n\nAlso, tell your husband to grow the hell up about babies changing things. Haha. My husband was like that and he got over it and he looooves our kids and doesn't mind adjusting things for them.",
            "You're totally right. 100%. \n\nNow, to help you deal with this shit here's a little advice from a mom of a 15 month old. \n\nYou are now officially past the honeymoon stage of bringing home baby. Congrats!! You, husband and tiny human are alive!! Huzzah! That's really, really amazing. But you're **tired** in a soul crushing way. The hormones are (sort of) starting to settle. You now get to deal with settling into a new normal. Husband is now competing for wants and needs from a tiny, bossy potato. And he's losing. For good reason. He's afraid that the way things are represent from here on out, and you're afraid his bad attitude represents from here on out as well. \n\nSo, bear in mind that this is SO temporary. The fighting is your relationships bones settling into place.\n\n\nIf I were you I'd go up, give him a big kiss and say \"I'm going to sit this one out. Go and have fun. Call me to pick you up or call you an uber so you can drink. Next year we will go, but I'm just not up to it yet.\" Feel free to reference the medical discharge paperwork that says \"don't clean for 8w.\" \nHe's just really scared about the change and he's desperate for something normal from his \"old life\". ",
            "I had surgery earlier this year and at about 3 weeks, I did a short road trip (as a passenger) and did a mini vacation with family, but everything was still so sore that I put out the word ahead of time not to hug me, and I spent part of that time with ice packs clutched against the incisions.\n\nThere's no way at 5 weeks I'd be comfortable with the idea of someone else's animals being excited by all the company and wanting to jump or climb on me. At 5 weeks, I think I was still protectively covering my chest with my arms when I was just walking in the local park and someone had their dog off leash - because what if the dog came up and jumped on me and scraped the scars? \n\nAnd even at my best days, without surgery, I'm not comfortable with someone's animals climbing on me and sitting in a pile of pet hair. \n\nI'd tell him to please go, enjoy himself, if there is drinking involved don't drive home drunk, and give everyone my regards. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you deciding for yourself what your recovery is going to look like. Actually, screw the recovery - there's nothing wrong with you deciding you don't want to attend a get-together, period.",

            "Not only are you exhausted and most likely in so much pain, but as someone your age without kids with friends who do have kids, bringing a 5-week-old baby to a drinking event wouldn't be fun for anyone. You'd be stressed, the hosts would be stressed with their animals, and your friends may be different but I know I personally get really uncomfortable around newborns because they're so vulnerable to sickness.\n\nLiterally the only person who wants this is your husband for no reason other than the fear of change.",

I'm sure all your friends are expecting you're not going to be attending a month and change into taking care of an infant.\n\nFrankly, I think he should stay home with you. That's what I would do in his shoes. Like it or not, things DO change when you have a baby and you can't just do whatever you want all the time.

Not so much.  Those first 8 weeks or so you've got to keep things fairly controlled - a boozy Friendsgiving with a bunch of child-free people and a pack of cats and dogs is pretty much the opposite of that.

This is about those first two months needing to keep the baby fairly protected since their immune system isn't fully ramped up yet. (And throw in the fact it's the start of flu season, that's not a minor issue.)\n\nAnd, you know, you just had major abdominal surgery and might not be up to going out.  5 weeks post abdominal surgery without the newborn in the equation is tough enough, let alone with newborn care.\n\nYour husband is having a temper tantrum, and he needs to grow up.

I don't know if you pump milk but you could always say \"you will\" and tell him he will have to take on a majority of the responsibility for your baby that night if he really wants to go. I doubt he will be as eager to go if he has to think about being in your shoes and how tiring that is for you. Goodness you just gave birth! I know many parents who won't even let family members be around their children for some time for fear of germs and so the mother can rest and have bonding time with her baby.

Not that you have to live like a total hermit before then, but open-air activities (eg, walking around the block, going to the park) are greatly preferable to a party in an enclosed space.

Every reason you give makes sense as a new mom. You are adjusting to a new life with a newborn who depends on you to watch out for him. That is your most important job from now on. You will have plenty of nights out with friends when your son is older. He's brand new for God';s sake. ",
            "For real for real, all you had to say was \"I have a FIVE WEEK OLD\"\n\nAND you had a c-section?! You are absolutely entitled to take this time to rest. You need it!",
            "*Change* is pretty much a fundamental quality of *life.*",
            "Stay home. Enjoy your time alone with baby. Let husband go by himself. From a marriage counselor to a young couple with a first time baby. Make the small adjustments for the new baby, but always put your marital relationship before the kids (don\u2019t forgo safety though). \n\nBefore someone starts, I have 4 kids (18, 14, 8, 3)and married 20 years. ",
            "I stopped reading at \"five weeks-old\".\n\nNo shit a mother with such a young baby isn't up  for much socializing.\n\nIs he not pulling his weight in baby duty? Because it doesn't sound like he's feeling the pain quite enough.",
            "Oh look another post that makes me not want to be female and especially not a heterosexual one. Light suicidality commencing in 3... 2... 1...",
            "Just some extra thoughts in addition to the obvious:\n\nIt might be helpful for you/your husband to have some conversations about the difference between keeping ahold of your sense of self and identity separate from becoming a parent, and making sure that you both have regular time for yourselves as individuals and as a couple, versus refusing to acknowledge the reality as that babies and children have different needs than adults and thus things ARE going to change drastically. \n\nI remember a couple years ago when heading to a Christmas party at a friend's house, when our daughter was only about 13 months, and my husband was in a crappy mood for some reason and got pissy at me because of how much kid stuff/extra food I packed for our kid. He said he missed our old, more mobile lifestyle. I was like, \"that's nice. Doesn't change a damn thing!\" The kid is going to need a nappy change. And probably a clothing change. And she's going to need her own food because I have no idea what our friends are serving. And she's going to need a bottle of milk because she's a baby. And she's going to need a jacket because it's freezing and pouring rain, even if we're only going to be outside for a couple minutes. \n\nSo yeah, things are going to change in a HUGE way, and those early weeks are a pretty freaky time when that's all starting to sink in and you feel like this is your life now and you're never going to get to do anything fun or adult ever again FOREVER! It will get easier, but it's a huge adjustment and your husband might need some prompting to step back and get some perspective that it will all be okay, it's not forever. But he needs to be realistic and think about the needs of his family right now.",
            "As a first time mom who's just gone through nearly 2 years of baby stuff, even if you did decide to placate your husband and go with him, you'd be so preoccupied with the baby and having the deal with feedings and changes and everything else the baby needs, you'd not be able to get much socializing in. Even at 2, if I do decide to go to something with my kid, I spend half my time apologizing to whoever I'm trying to talk to because I have to go grab my kid from doing some dangerous shit or something ridiculous. Your lives will change unfortunately. ",
            "When your husband goes to Friendsgiving and tells your friends that you are tired and the baby is only 5 weeks old, they will tell him, \"Of course she should stay home. It's too early for all this socializing.\"\n\nYour husband doesn't realize that he doesn't know about the what goes on in real life. ",
            "Of course you aren\u2019t unreasonable. You are still recovering from a major medical event. Let\u2019s say you had an organ removed five weeks ago and still felt wiped out and exhausted and still healing. Would he make you go?! You are recovering from a major medical event AND growing a human with your body. This has been like one almost year long strain on your body. Five weeks to be 100% is insane.\n\nYour lives HAVE TO CHANGE. Pretending everything is the same is insane. You are parents now. You have a kid. You took on entirely new, important roles in life and he expects you to roll along like nothing happened? Hell, your lives would change if you got a roommate. You added a child to your home. This is probably the biggest life change you can make. Did he want to have a baby? Does he know how ridiculous he is being? Was this your choice or a mutual one?",
            "I'm not saying your friends don't love you, and I'm positive they'll miss you - but a 5 week old does not belong at a party. It would cause stress and tension to you and them. I have a friend with a newborn and I adore that little baby.. But none of the rest of us have babies and we still want to do (every once in a blue moon) adult-centered events. My friend is so understanding and great about this. New borns are a big adjustment, your husband needs to realise this is temporary, and for now some changes are a necessity.",
            "I've been in a similar situation. My in-laws expected me to come to a fathers day party and bring my 2 week old daughter (who was 6 weeks premature). My husband agreed with me, but when my in-laws literally freaked out (yelling, screaming, immature Facebook posts) because we didn't go my husband totally threw me under the bus. It caused a lot of tension in my marriage and to this day my in-laws have little to do with my daughter.  \n\nI stood my ground and a year and a half later I'm still 100% positive I made the right decision. \n\nBabies are only little once. The time flies by. You should soak up every second with your son. You shouldn't have to worry about cooties and people keeping him awake. You're his Momma and your one and only responsibility right now is taking care of him. Your friends will be there next year-- your newborn wont. ",
            "For all the comments it doesn't seem like you two were on the same page before making this huge commitment of bringing the little one to this world. It would be wise to see what else you both don't know or want out of the relationship. What are your priorities? How do you want to raise the kid? it can save you a lot of headaches and will be much better for your baby.",

            "Your husband needs reality check if he getting mad about this! I have no kids my self but friends experiences, children change everything!\n\nAlso my friend nearly died during childbirth took her 6 months while with baby to recover and her husband knew he had to give up alot of things he used to do, to help her and the baby. \n\n5 weeks is early you need to rest and be for your baby! I just don't know why hubby thinks children won't change anything and why did he accept having kids? Sorry if this comes off harsh but this puzzles me. You're in the right about this.\n\nCan he talk to his father or your father for advice about fatherhood that could perhaps make realise the idea of fatherhood?",
            "When you have a child, your entire world is rocked and EVERYTHING changes. Time for your husband to grow up and embrace the change.\n\nAlso, I work in NICU\u2019s with sick babies. It\u2019s honestly better for you to stay home right now than go out to please a grown man. ",
            "I don't understand why he isn't planning Thanksgiving with his nuclear family (you, baby, him).  He chose to become a father.  Is he going to be a good one?  Or is he going to put his friends above his wife and son?  Will he verbally abuse his son's mother when she makes decisions he doesn't agree with?  Has he always been this way?\n\nA 5 week old baby is likely to catch whatever is going around.  People who don't have kids don't really \"get\" this.  \"Oh, yeah, I've had a sniffle for a couple of days, no big deal\" becomes \"Honey, wake up, we have to take the baby to the ER\" because baby cannot breathe.  A baby who can't breathe, can't eat.\n\nAdditionally, if you're allergic to cats, chances are good that your baby is, too.  Again, a baby who can't breathe, can't eat.\n\nBabies are not some sort of trophy that one uses to show off one's parent/grandparent status.  Babies are actually little people, who have feelings, needs, and desires just like anyone else.  Taking them to show off to a bunch of childless people at such a young age is madness.  If hubby must go, have him take a picture on his phone, and show THAT around.  It won't catch the cold that Jeff has, and won't stop functioning because of the cats.\n\nThere is no way my spouse would abandon me on a major holiday, and when our kids were tiny, he did half the work.  The only reason I got as much sleep as I did was that he changed diapers, soothed cranky babies, etc.  I feel very sad that your spouse, who seemed on board with having kids, now seems to think that you can just haul son around like a teddy bear, with no regard to his needs.\n\nBest of luck navigating this situation.  I hope your hubby gets his act together and stops trying to browbeat you into going to Friendsgiving.  I also hope that he will go to therapy with you, because something is wrong with this picture, and I think you two need to get to the bottom of it.",

You need to sit your hubby down, maybe with an impartial 3rd party, and talk about this. Because if your life DOESN'T change when you have a baby, then you're doing it wrong! \n\nYou stay home!

If the friends would not be understanding, then I think it would be time to find new friends.",
            "I totally understand your reasons for not wanting to go to Friendsgiving. I also can empathize with the challenges you're having with your husband. We went through the same thing. My husband was so short sighted about our need to adjust our life and schedules when the baby came. I tried to have a more balanced mindset. Sure,  we weren't those wild 20 somethings who hit up happy hour all the time and popped around town doing whatever we wanted, but we could still be social. It just changed. We couldn't do absolutely everything, but we still we're able to do some social things. Also, having a 5week old is significantly more demanding than older kids. \n\nI just tried to drill into my husband's head first to be patient. We JUST had a baby. If we need to be super chill for awhile, it doesn't mean we've turned into the world's most boring people. We can take our time getting back out and into the groove of being social. Also, things HAVE changed,  and that's OK. We are parents now. That doesn't mean it's the end of our social lives,  it just means an adjustment, and we need to just be OK with that. ",
            "First of all, congratulations on the baby! And you're absolutely right. You do have every right to take your time to get on your feet as well mentally and for god's sake, what did he think would happen with a baby entering the world. You rock, girl, for taking care of your baby so well and thinking of everything and I wish you all the best, strength and more sleep than is being told new parents get. ",
            "What was the process of choosing to have a child like amongst you two? Was there one person pushing to have one more than the other? Any convincing needed on either side or were you both pretty excited? How long before you got pregnant did you guys originally talk about child plans?",

            "I have a tight group of friends and the couple who had the first kid were both terrified of their lives changing. Tell you what, their lives did change, and so did all of ours! She had some complications and had to go back to the hospital. We all ended up taking shifts at her house with baby while she was getting better. \n\nWe are all close with her daughter in a special way that is different than the subsequent kids. After my friend was up to it, baby came to every party. Her portable crib-thingy was set up various hilarious places, (closets, bathrooms) wherever was quietest. \n\nWe made sure there was always somebody sober just in case, and we took turns. My friend and her husband decreased how much they drank/took turns, but still had fun. \n\nThat said, my friend set clear limits in the beginning, and often wanted to be the one to host so that they didn\u2019t have to cart the baby around needlessly, avoided germs, unruly pets etc.\n\nThere is no way at week 5 that she was going to a big drinking night with all of us only to remain sober and get no sleep with the baby. Like you, she would have opted out in some way. Or come for an hour or two and left. \n\nYou are not wrong. And, your husband doesn\u2019t have to freak out that the three of you will never go out again. You don\u2019t seem like those types of people They are out there though! I\u2019ve met couples who completely vanished after having kids. To each their own, but that seems a bit extreme. Maybe try to talk out his fears? But he needs to get on board and have your back. You\u2019re a team and being a team is what is best for your kid.\n\nYour friends will understand if they are good friends.\n\nI\u2019m childfree, but I love my friends\u2019 kids and it\u2019s been awesome watching them be amazing parents to tiny humans who are like them in so many awesome ways.",

I thought it was frowned upon to expose them to too much before vaccines. \n\nHonestly, you need to do what's right for you and your baby. Your husband is being immature and selfish. You are not boring, you're responsible. I hope you and your brand new baby enjoy a nice evening at home. ",
            "Let him be annoyed. It's not a baby friendly event and not worth the stress of going. He will get over it. Just because you miss one event doesn't mean that you have become a boring mom. You are still adjusting to all the changes. You both need to remind yourselves that change isn't a bad thing! It's just different than before. It's about changing from thoughts of resentment to finding a balance. This takes time and adjustments. The new born stage is short and hard but not a representation of how your life will be forever so don't worry!",
            "At 5 weeks postpartum you could still be healing! I didn't leave my room for the first 3 months(with my first baby) if didn't have to. Take care of the baby, feed myself, shower, visit my mother, sleep. That was my life. If people came to visit us they'd come into my room to visit. It generally kept people from over staying and my baby was nursing every 2hrs on the dot.\nYour life now is centered around that tiny ball of cells you decided to create together and until you get the hang of it and feel comfortable enough to go do the thing, nobody should be pressuring you or making you feel worthless for doing just that. Also, It doesn't matter if it's your 4th or 5th  kid. If you just gave within the last 3 months, you need to take care of yourself and your kids and that's it. ",

It is a very hard adjustment but have faith that you and your partner will learn how to adjust and still have each other\u2019s backs, always. \nTell he you know he is disappointed that you don\u2019t want to go, but you hope he has a great time.

This year, my oldest sister is due to give birth any day near the end of December / beginning of January.

I will say that our son was born 2 weeks before Thanksgiving.  When he was 2 weeks old we went to our family thanksgiving, but it was relaxing, no major socializing, just my in-laws and me and my wife.

I feel like you are not empathizing with the fact that I just had a baby and I am *physically* exhausted and not up to doing a lot of social things right now. I'm also concerned about the baby's health during cold and flu season and would prefer to not expose him unnecessarily. I'm starting to resent the way you're treating me and I don't like feeling this way, so I need you to chill and empathize with my situation.\" \n\nIf he didn't think a baby would change anything, he's either lived under a rock his whole life or he's exceedingly stupid.

When my son was born I made a huge point to do my hair and makeup and wear heels to show that I was sooooo together. Obviously I was just trying to figure out who I was post birth. I don\u2019t know your husband but to me it sounds like he\u2019s trying to find a way for things to be \u201cnormal\u201d even though his world is upside down.

There's the danger of something happening to the baby with the animals. There's all the germs.

All of our closest friends don't have kids and there's a lot they don't get about having kids, despite loving ours very much. Anyways, it sounds like he's not a terrible husband, but you guys are going to keep having this conversation with yourselves and with each other about \"who am I and who are we, now that we have a kid?\" You're going to envy your friends for how much easier it is for them to get together and drink on a weeknight, because they don't have to find a babysitter. You both might desperately try looking for a hobby or something that makes you feel like a real person, because for the next few months, everything is about surviving and sleep deprivation and keeping the baby alive. The sleep deprivation alone might make you say some awful things to each other. It will hopefully be enough of an explanation to say that you are STILL recovering from a major surgery, and that this will be just one of many compromises ahead. \n\nbut TLDR; this stage doesn't last forever. you'll both need to go easy on each other for a while - at the end of the day, it'll be the two of you on the same team.",
            "At 5 weeks You\u2019re not healed from your surgery yet let alone anything else. Stay home rest and plan a meet up in 6 months. Friendseaster or something. ",

            "This is a very dangerous time for babies, and you (you are recovering!!). The cold and flu season is here, if your son gets sick he could end up in the hospital (see also RSV). Heck with that. Now your husband is acting like a spoiled baby himself. And an ignorant one. Stand your ground, look up and print some newborn safety info. for him. But seriously.....this should be a non-issue, you don't want to go and gave your reasons, he shouldn't be questioning you. At All.",

            "As a new father of a 3-month-old baby, when I saw the second sentence, I didn't bother continuing to read, at this age, the priority is mother and child, you both just went through a traumatic experience and you both need to recover.  My wife did a vaginal birth so recovered quicker, but still, we didn't go out socially until much later.\n\nAt this point, if you think you need to rest, you rest, especially after a major abdominal surgery!\n\nNothing stays the same after a birth, everything turns up-side down and your life isn't anywhere the same.  I think you need a sit-down with your husband and help him re-adjust expectations.  \n\nIt might be worth your husband finding other dads of newborns so they can share experience and advice.  If he wouldn't listen to you, he might listen to other dads.  I hope you already have your own support network of new mums as well.",
            "I'm curious to what your husbands reaction would be if you told him you have pumped some milk out and packed a bag of diapers etc then just hand him the baby for the day? ",
            "Hi. New dad here. Your husband is being selfish needs to calm the fuck down. You're still in the 4th trimester potato phase and wanting to skip events is totally normal. It's not \"the beginning of the end.\" This is a temporary phase and it gets easier to go out when the kid is a little older. You aren't even preventing him from going solo if he wants to!\n\nTell him one whiny baby is enough for you to deal with at the moment. ",
            "Babies change everything. That's a huge part of why I don't have one lol.\n\nMaybe he just means he wants to be one of those parents that go with the flow as opposed to staying home all the time with the baby? Example... my ex's sister was one of those parents that never left the house with the baby. She'd talk about 'when the baby is older' sort of whistfully. One of my best friends is like this too. My brother on the other hand... he and his wife seem to be taking the approach of fitting the baby into their lives... they pack up the diaper bag and the baby and go.  Neither of them are wrong. It's just a different approach.\n\nI'd suggest bringing this up with your husband. What exactly does he mean? That he literally doesn't want things to change? Or that he wants the baby to fit into life instead of keeping you both home? If it's the latter, there's negotiation here - id tell him 5 weeks post c-section he needs to take your lead here and if you're not comfortable, you're not comfortable. Going forward, if you're more wanting to stay home and he always just wants to pack up the baby and go then you two will both need to compromise a bit. If he legit thinks a baby shouldn't change anything... well... that's a bigger problem that I don't have much advice for.",
            "I think it\u2019s important to note here that *neither* of you are being unreasonable.  It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to leave the house with a 5-week old baby and do something social (it\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s not impossible). Its also perfectly reasonable to not want to either! Especially for the reasons you cited... \n\nBoth of your lives have changed dramatically, but biology dictates that you\u2019ve taken the brunt of it so far.  I remember feeling for the first 3 months like I had nothing interesting to say (that didn\u2019t involve various bodily fluids), so I didn\u2019t really want to be around people (despite the crippling loneliness of mat leave). And it\u2019s really hard to be among the first of a friend group to have kids, because they don\u2019t really get it until they\u2019ve been there. \n\nWhat you guys need to do is make sure you\u2019re listening to each other. Your husband is telling you he misses some of your old life. You\u2019re telling him you\u2019re not ready to go. \n\nSo maybe you skip Friendsgiving, but meet up with a small group sometime soon at a brewery (newborns are so portable - take advantage of that before nap schedules dictate your social life! :)  Him going solo isn\u2019t a bad idea - he can enjoy it the way he used to, and you can have your quiet night at home (just accept the possibility he might come home drunk, and he can learn the joy of parenting with a hangover tomorrow :) \n\nStart finding ways now to make sure you both have what you need.  At this age, that means a lot of divide and conquer. As the kiddo gets older, make sure you find a sitter you trust (bonus if it\u2019s a free relative!), and you can make the time to be social adults too. Also, find your parent tribe \u2014 it\u2019s awesome to have a social circle with people who have kids the same age (they have childproofed homes and the same schedule and limits as you :)",

It's natural, but will be tough if he clings for a long time. But he may (seriously) need to grieve the loss of that period of life. He may not be ready to face that loss yet.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with your approach. But it is fair for you to tell him to stop pushing you!",

            "My husband and I went through something really similar to this. Basically we took a 10 hour road trip for a family reunion 6 weeks post partum after a traumatic birth. It came down to one of us was gonna resent the other, and I decided I could forgive him. So we went. I had an emotional breakdown. My husband ended up realizing that he was not emotionally coping with almost losing me and was putting his wants first. He has since profusely apologized for not putting his family first. \n\nWith our second, my brother got married 3 weeks postpartum. We made it to the wedding, I basically only stood for pictures. I almost hemorrhaged and was hospitalized. \n\nYou need to remind your husband that your baby has no advocate besides you two. Your baby cannot decide \u201chey, if I catch the flu that means I get a spinal tap. Should I still go?\u201d  \n\nNPR did a great piece on postpartum injury and death if he\u2019d like to give it a read. An insane amount of deaths happen AFTER 6 weeks postpartum.

            "I'm a father of a 2 year old. As I'm sure you're learning now, a 5 week old baby is the center of attention, and will change the type of activities you and your husband can do - regardless of what he wants or thinks. \n\nC-section is a major operation as well. Your husband needs to think about it from this way: The doctors cut you open, physically removed an organ that was in you (the placenta), removed the baby, and stitched you up. On my wife at least, the area they did they operation is in the lower stomach area, the same area where you bend down, and where you use your core muscles to carry things. \n\nI'm willing to bet you're doing a lot of bending, and carrying a heavy, delicate object now, and potentially in a decent amount of pain too. \n\nBabies are, thankfully, quite flexible and don't get hurt that easily. However, you don't want to risk having to shoo away dogs, or cats from them. Plus, nice dogs may become a mean dog around a baby. \n\nHere's what I would do:\n\n1. I would explain that, for you, life has changed. You are still recovering from a major operation where an organ has been removed, and recovering from the stitches they put in, and you need more time to rest. \n\n2. I would also remind your husband that the baby's well being does comes first now, and the baby did a change in your life, and it will never become the same again. You and him are now responsible for a helpless, breathing person who loves you a lot. The life you had before will never return, and that you will become more of a \"boring\" wife/mom/friend. Besides, how are you getting a good 8 hours of sleep anyway? What's the secret, in case we have another child.\n\n3. I would make a compromise  with your husband. One (bad) option is for him to go to \"Friendsgiving\" by himself, and leave you alone with the baby. A better option would be to skip this year's Friendsgiving, and instead invite a couple of the friends over for dinner at a time, when things settle down and you feel up to it. \n\n4. Please, please do not drink around your baby. Your mind is already fuzzy from the lack of sleep. You need to be able to think as clearly as possible, in case something bad is happening to the baby, and alcohol will affect that type of decision making.\n\nGood luck.\n\n",
            "I can't believe anyone would be ok with bringing a baby to that house especially one so young.  \nWhen guys become first time fathers it is hard to accept that their life style is going to change.  At first they want to pretend that a baby changes nothing and will go about their day as if nothing has changed.  \nThen they feel like shit because they know what is needed of them and their responsibilities but are not fulfilling those responsibilities.\nSome fathers can also feel jealous of all the attention the baby is getting while they get less.  He could be getting upset about the Friendsgiving deal because it's easier than saying \"I envy the new baby and would appreciate a little attention.\"  \nFemales will get upset about something but not admit what the true reason is for them being upset.  Guys always say they would never do that and would just admit what is upsetting them......

Socializing can take a break right now, you have a brand new baby, & I think that is more reason than enough to skip it this year! Would you be okay with him going without you? I think as long as he feels he can go, then there shouldn't be an issue. Whenever you want a mini break from the babe, maybe go shopping or just take yourself out for a coffee or see a friend, he can get you back for watching the baby for Friendsgiving. \n\nI'm sorry he's fighting you so much on this. That's exhausting for him to be so narrowminded, and for him to keep stressing the fact he doesn't want his life to change, worries me that he isn't ready at all for the changes ahead. Maybe seeing a counselor and having an objective party paint it for him could be beneficial? The coolest dads are the ones that would do anything for their family, I hope he can see that soon.

He is probably scared of losing his identity, his friends, his adult life. Tell him that you relate to that (if you do) and that you are on board for social events in the future (if you are), but right now it's just too early. There is a massive difference between \"you are wrong\" and \"I get where you are coming from, but I disagree.\" I'm picking up a lot of \"you're wrong\" right now, but I think in a good partnership, you want to acknowledge each other's opinions/ feelings even if you disagree.

Me and most of my friends are childless and even we know this. \n\nI just... the things coming out in the comments are just flooring me.

If he was so adverse to having your lives change, why did he even bring up having a child? Why wait to tell you until you were pregnant?

My SIL's cat has also growled at him while he was getting buckled up in his car seat. These are normally very friendly cats. \n\nAll my friends have pets and none of them are used to kids.

Alternatively, it is possible to get a babysitter and prepump so you could go and have drinks if you wanted, but at the end of the day, you've stated you just don't **want** to go, and that's totally okay.\n\nYour husband needs to let up off you a bit; your baby is barely over a month old, it's fine to skip out on a social event to stay home with him.\n\nSounds like your husband is afraid *his* social life is going to die if he lets yours, so he's being pushy about it. He has some pretty unrealistic ideas about parenting if he thinks everything will stay the same after you have a kid. It was unfair of him to try and make you promise things wouldn't change.",
            "First and foremost, I think you're in the right here and it's totally reasonable to want to skip this event. Your husband is being inconsiderate.\n\nThinking beyond Friendsgiving, it seems to me that he's having (has been for a while?) an emotional reaction to becoming a parent that you guys should talk more about. When he says he doesn't want the baby to change everything or become the center your lives, what exactly does he mean? What are the actual changes that would make him unhappy? Are those things reasonable, objectively or even just in your opinion? What is it about those things changing that he doesn't like? If those things seem unreasonable to you, maybe ask him - how does he imagine reconciling having a kid and not making whatever change he's worried about? Like, how would that actually work? What does he imagine when, inevitably, making some change in your lives seems like a bad idea to him, but a good idea to you? And what's the timeline here? He's clearly got it wrong in his head. Having a 5 week old is crazy disruptive to anyone's life, even the person most gung-ho committed to living a life that doesn't revolve around their kids. So what does he imagine things look like in 3 months, 6 months, etc.? And how does that compare to what you imagine, and what is realistic? Finally, he says he doesn't want the baby to change everything. But, obviously, some shit is gonna change. So what changes does he feel good about? And to be clear - I don't think asking him all this is about him getting to define what is and isn't going to happen, but about getting to the bottom of what he's really worried about so that you guys can talk about those things and work through them together.\n\nAgain, I think you're right, and every single reason you came up with for wanting to skip Friendsgiving seems perfectly valid. But it also seems pretty normal to me that a 31-year-old with a new baby is scared about how his life is going to change. He's probably also super excited...but still scared. He is NOT handling those fears well right now. But talking it out and getting to the bottom of them might be helpful in putting this Friendsgiving situation in perspective, and getting you guys on the same page about the future.",

        "selftext": "He's a full-time student who works part-time in the summer. I have a full-time and part-time job (he studies a lot). We live together and mostly live off my pay while he stretches what he makes in the summer. Neither of us have ever owned a car because it isn't necessary where we live. \n\n\nWe both walk or take the public everywhere to save money. In the morning we stop at a corner shop shortly before splitting up for the day. He buys cigarettes and coffee. I buy fruit for my lunch and, on the weekends, lotto tickets. \n\n\nHe always makes fun of me for paying the \"stupid tax\". But I figure my indulgence is cheaper and doesn't come with lung cancer. Sometimes I jokingly tell him not to expect a penny when I win.\n\n\nThe day I won he answered me with \"Fine, keep it all! It's not like I'm crying over a penny of nothing over here.\"\n\n\nI showed him I'd won. He stared for a bit and then dismissively told me I'd probably spent more than that on tickets. In response I asked what I should blow his half on for myself. I was honestly joking at the time but he suddenly became angrier than I've ever seen him and I didn't want to admit I'd been kidding because he was so pissed off it pissed *me* off. \n\n\nHe wants a car, and I don't. He keeps trying to steamroller me so I'm refusing to share the money. In honesty I'm willing to spend or save the money for us but I don't want a car. I won't use a car and it will keep costing us money in parking and maintenance. \n\n\nAfter weeks of him sulking and lecturing me about his \"entitlement\" to the money he took me to a car lot and tried to embarrass me into going along with him in front of a salesman. I threw a tantrum after we left without buying anything and I went to my mom's and paid our rent up to the end of the year and donated the rest to charity. He doesn't know. \n\n\nI fucked up and don't know how to come clean.\n\n\nTl;dr: I haven't told my boyfriend I spent the money I won because I was upset he was being a dick. He's already angry at me. What do I do? ",

            "It was always your money, OP. Even in the absence of the whole debate about lottery tickets, even if he was totally supportive of you buying lottery tickets, it was always your money. \n\nPaying your rent ahead and making a tax deductible charitable donation is actually a pretty good use of $10,000.\n\nWhat you should be worried about is how much more of yourself you're going to invest in a relationship with someone who thinks it's okay to try to shame you into spending a huge amount of your money on something he wants, and acts like a petulant child when he doesn't get his way. ",
            ">I fucked up and don't know how to come clean.\n\nI don't think you fucked up at all. ",
            "So your boyfriend got super angry about something he should have been happy about, and then got really pushy about how you should spend your money.\n\nBecause it is, well, was, your money. He's not entitled to a cent, despite how he's acting. ",
            "Decision we make in anger arn't always the best ones, and we can often regret them when we calm down. But what you did in anger can easily be justified even now. So you don't need to regret what you did in your anger at all. Perhaps you don't even have to regret your anger.\n\nTry to remember *why* you got so angry.\n\nIt seems like you first got angry when at the mere thought that he might not get half the money, he blow up at you. That revealed that his first and perhaps only priority was to get his cut. There was no consern at all over how this money could effect you or both of your lives, only \"me me me\". Honestly, if that money had been be spent so you could working less, or invested in your future or on a nice getaway for the two of you it would have benefited him alot and he should have been grateful for that. Even spending a large chunk of it on something nice for just you would have been fair as appriciation for all the hard work you've put in to support your household. But he only cared about what he felt was owed him and what he wanted. You're damn right to be angry at that! How selfish can he be?\n\nThen you got angry because he tried to pressure and manipulate you into getting what he wanted. No compromise and no consern for what you might want or think, but again it was \"me me me\". Only more because now he wasn't only upset that he wasn't getting \"his\" money, but actually trying to figure out how to get \"his\" money from you without your approval. He didn't care how you felt about it if he got a car out of it. This feels little better than theft, but via entitlement and manipulation instead of ouright stealing it. Again, your anger is extremly justifiable.\n\nThen you were conviced that as long as you had the money he would never stop trying to take it. Always looking for a new way to get to the money and not caring what it did to you or your relationship. Of course you got rid of it! It was self preservation to stop him from tearing throug you to get to your money.\n\nIt might have been done in anger, but it was an anger born from needing to fight for yourself. There are different kinds of anger, and not all of them are bad. Some gives us the courage to stand up for ourseves or the strenght to do something difficult. It really feels like this was a *rightous anger*, and you shouldn't regret it.\n\nYou reacted to your bfs disgraceful behaviour with anger on now this is the situation you're in. Are you going to pretend your anger wasn't normal and justifiable in this situation and apologies? Are you going to take the blame for the situation you bf relentlessly pushed you into? Or a you going to tell him what you did without fear and shame and tell him that his selfish and manipulative behaviour cost him a car and is about to cost him his girlfriend too?\n\nYour action of giving away money without consulting your bf because you're worried what he'll do to get to it is not worse than him trying to get the money by (almost) any means necessary for his own selfish reasons. Far from it. Please think this through before you start apologising to him or trying to find way to make it up to him. Remember your anger. It was more truthful than the doubt your feeling now anyway.",
            "Yeah you fucked up OP big time. Seriously I can't believe some of the messages in here. You messed up big. I mean how on earth have you not dumped this asshole yet? *ha*. You're young, and recently have no concerns about spending money on rent. Get a new boyfriend, or a room mate who pays their full share instead of letting their savings die off for 2-3 months.\n\nGet away from this loser and into a happier life. Tell him you two are through and he can go find another woman to buy him a car. Wish him good fucking luck.",
            "He's been calling you stupid every week for... how long? And then you won, and he was a jerk about it, and so you left him out if the winnings. \n\nThen you went ahead and did one of the smartest things possible with the prize: you paid your rent!\n\nThe wrong move you've made, as far as I can see, is you put up with your boyfriend being rude for too long.",
            "I've re-read your post twice, and I think you forgot to include the part where you fucked up at all.\n\nHow does that guy get his pants on over that swollen ego?",
            "The only mistake you made was supporting this asshat. He's literally leaching off of you, and now you're worried he will be mad that you spent your winnings. I wouldn't even worry about it. What's he going to do? Leave you? Then he'd have to support himself. Not likely. ",
            "I fail to see where you messed up here.  He belittled you for months or years for playing the lotto a \"reasonable\" amount.  It's not like you were buying dozens of tickets each time.\n\nYou were willing to share but then he became hostile.  So instead of doing anything rash or unreasonable, you bought yourself a few months of peace of mind by paying off your lease, and also paying some of your good fortune forward.\n\nThis wasn't a one time deal.  He spent WEEKS trying to wear you down for something only he wanted.\n\nYou don't need to come clean.  If he asks about the money just tell him it's already accounted for and spoken for.  If he tries to guilt you or blow up on you don't accept it and say that for 9 out of 12 months of the year, you shoulder the weight of rent and living expenses.  So you naturally used the money to save up and buy yourself and HIM some breathing room.  \n",

            "Now, the money you usually spend on rent?  Invest it.  ",
            "The only part where you fucked up was when you agreed to be this deadbeat's doormat.  Now that your rent is paid up, by you and you alone, I'd think long and hard about who was going to be living there until your lease is up.",
            "Nope, your boyfriend fucked up. He was a massive, entitled tool. \n\nThat was your ticket, that was your winnings. His response is telling. Especially in that he lives off you anyway.",
            "Tell him what you did and explain that if he'd like a car, he's welcome to save his own money for it. Tell him also that you won't be supporting his habits or his personal, \"fun\" expenses like cigarettes and coffee in any way, since clearly sharing finances isn't working for the two of you. Tell him that you expect he'll split the household finances 50/50 with you, which he should absolutely be able to cover with a part time job without paying rent. \n\nYou didn't fuck up. You spent money that you earned in a way that you wanted to, and it paid off. You got more money. You made a decision to spend that money in a way that STILL benefits you both. If he continues to be an ass, I'd ask yourself whether you want to continue supporting a giant manbaby who expects you to fork over whatever you have for whatever he feels like.",
            "the only way you're fucking up here is by staying in a relationship with this mooching, entitled asshole.",
            "I'm not seeing the fuck up here. Your boyfriend was an asshole about it, it was your money to spend, he's made fun of you for buying lotto tickets, and tried to fucking steamroll you into doing what HE wanted with YOUR money.\n\nIf you feel like your mistake was giving the money to a charity instead of spending it on yourself, unfortunately I can't help you there. If you feel like your mistake was not including your boyfriend in your winnings...you didn't make a mistake at all.",
            "Well he sounds like an asshole. Side note, you should probably visit /r/personalfinance. They have a subject in the sidebar about managing windfalls. Be prepared for taxes.",
            "You didn't fuck up.\n\"I did t like the way the money was making us fight, and didn't appreciate the childish way you were behaving over MY MONEY so I paid up the rent, and donated the rest.\"",
            "Break up with him. That's how you fix this. ",
            "You didn't fuck up. He did by treating your money like his money. He needs to know that browbeating you at home and in public is not acceptable. Set him straight.\n\nPaying your rent was smart and charity is hardly ever a mistake. Someone in need might be better off because of it. Do not regret it please.",
            "Why are you guys still together? You guys sound so unhappy, and he's an immature child.",
            "If I were you I'd dump the boyfriend for being a whiny, entitled jerk. ",
            "You need to have a talk about money. \n\n1. It's just not a good idea to be supporting him when you are not married. You can see now that he is not exactly appreciative, but now thinks he has a say over all your money. Set a share of the rent that is his. He needs to pay a portion of the utilities every month. If he runs out of money he needs to get a loan or a part time job. You can loan him money once, but if he doesn't pay it back, that's a red flag.\n\n2. There is nothing wrong with you buying yourself something that you wanted. However, some of the money should have been put in your emergency fund, unless you already have one. You can still treat yourself with the saved money from rent. His anger prevented you from enjoying your windfall.\n\n3. You haven't fucked up. You need to figure why he got so angry. Talk to him about it. If you have a future together you have to be able to talk about things like this. Has he felt poor for too long? How much longer does he have to study? Does he really believe he needs a car? How could he pay the car insurance unless you paid for it? He might be unhappy feeling dependent on you, and this can bite you back later, if he breaks up with you to get rid of that feeling when he graduates and gets a job.\n\n",
            "Peace shouldn't cost you $10,000 \n;- )",
            "Lol. A smoker accusing a casual lotto player of paying stupid tax. That's rich. ",
            "You didn't fuck up. And I'm not just saying that because it's your money - I understand you feel guilty because you share finances, so you feel like the money should be split. But you did do that. You just split it differently. He may not get exactly 5k, but you got him off the hook for 4 months of rent. It may not be completely 100% even-stevens, but you said your rent/bills aren't that way either, so it's not like you're going from a point of equal footing to \"taking\" some of the shared finances, you're going from a point of disproportionately using your money to keep both of you afloat, to using your money as you want and also helping him at the same time.\n\nThat being said, he won't be happy about it even though it's logical and you're completely in the right. I would let it lie until he brings it up again, tell him that it was becoming a point of contention in your relationship so you made a decision that benefited both of you.",
            "You covered your rent and made a donation to charity. Sounds like you covered a priority and did a good deed. No fuck up there. If your boyfriend wanted \"his share\" maybe he should have split the cost of the ticket instead of ridiculing you for buying a lotto ticket.",
            "Your money, your business.  He is not entitled to one cent and certainly not to buy him a car!\n\nI do, however, hope you paid your taxes out of it already, or saved a portion back for that purpose.",
            "Just wanted to say good call on not getting a car. The money drain of a car is rediculous. My rommate bought a car recently thinking it would help his work (his work requires him to travel, and transit was really inconvenient) by the end of the year he was having more trouble paying rent than he did before the car, that alone effected me negatively quite a bit, not including the fact that we aren't dating. It was your money, I get feeling bad that you gave it away, but don't feel bad he didn't get any. ",
            "You just learned real cheaply and real quickly how bad of a choice to be with this man is for you.  If he is doing this, you need to run...if not, you are going to end up unhappy for a long long time.  ",

            "God damn entitlement. He doesn't deserve a penny of your winnings. ",
            "Did you use any portion of his money to pay for the tickets?  Then he had no right to expect a share of your winnings, especially if he'd been an ass about it.  And while spending it all without giving some thought to what might be the most beneficial way to handle that (like, say, putting some away in a savings account) wasn't the smartest call, it was your choice to make.\n\nThe real problem here is that this incident has exposed some deep and possibly fundamental incompatibilities in how you and your boyfriend approach money and spending priorities.  That's what you need to talk to him about, not how you \"fucked up\" by not just giving him what he wanted.  If he still insists he's done nothing out of line, then I wouldn't make any more long-term plans with him.",
            "Your boyfriend is not entitled to any money from you, and you certainly shouldn't give any to him. He sounds like an insufferable jerk. \n\nYou did not fuck up.

            "I hope you left enough for the taxman.\n\nThat said, I'm not sure how you fucked up?  Paying your rent ahead of time and donating to charity are both money well spent.",
            "You won $10,000 and insight into how your boyfriend will behave, how he's capable of blowing up on you, and his sense of entitlement. You won twice. ",
            "You didn't fuck up. Sure, he will be angry, but that doesn't mean you did anything wrong. You actually did something quite responsible and wonderful. Has his smoking done that for you? Nope.\n\nHe tried to manipulate and humiliate you to get what he wanted. Sounds like a pretty crappy and unsupportive partner to me.",
            "When you say you paid your rent up to the end of the year, you mean yours  and your boyfriend's, right? That's fine, then. Tell him he can save up the money he'll save on rent towards a car.",

            "You should definately get him to still pay you half the rent. This was your money and you are way too nice.",
            "First off, while this is a great sub and generally the people here are wonderful, helpful, and give great advice, sharing money is a very big divided opinion. People who don't share money with their partner don't understand why they should, and people who do don't understand why they shouldn't. It's a difference of personal opinion, so you're going to get very polar arguments for and against a lot of aspects of it. That said, regardless of whether or not anything from money to bathroom products is shared between you, he was a bit of a dick about the whole thing.\n\nAs someone who shares money with my partner, and has supported him when he had no income, the only issue I see here is that anyone else would take what you said as what it was. If I said that to my partner, he would laugh. There may be a small part of him that's worried I mean it, but ultimately he'd know it was stupid of him to doubt it in the first place and he'd feel like a complete dick.\n\nYour partner should know you well enough to know you wouldn't throw the fact that you won that money in his face like that. He should know it was a joke, because you'd have to be a bit of an asshole to do something like that and actually mean it 100%. Most people would just buy something for their partner out of the money instead of saying how much each of you are getting out of it. Nobody who was genuinely thinking \"fuck you, this is mine\" would genuinely say \"what should I blow your half on?\"\n\nAlso, I've been there and done that with making jokes with people other than my partner, and it tells you just how little they actually know you as a person. As I said before, your partner should probably know you well enough, especially if you're living together. It's fair enough to be upset, myself as an overanalyser would be questioning what the hell my partner must think of me to think that.\n\nOther than that, you paid the rent until the end of the lease. Do you realise what you did? You gave the both of you all of that rent as spending money until your lease is up. He could actually just save some money and buy a car with \"his\" money in this situation. You did something that'll make both of your lives a lot easier, and (this is going to sound rude af) if he doesn't think that's a good thing, either he's committed to being angry at you now regardless, or he's a bit dull. Either way, it's possible for him to get a car now anyway, so he can't really give you a solid reason to be pissed about how the money was spent other than *him specifically* not getting to spend it.\n\nAlso, I know anyone in your situation would be pretty upset, but you guys need to work on talking things out. You should have never been to that car lot and had a tantrum in the first place. He should never have lectured you about the money, either. If he wanted a car, he should've said \"I'm really sorry I've been such a dick about the lottery tickets, and I know that I don't really deserve a share of the money, but it would be really cool if you'd consider getting us a car.\" While you can't change the past, you may want to have a good chat about the way you guys handles this in terms of communication.\n\nOn your end, you're very lucky that your actions out of anger are still somewhat rational. You threw a tantrum, then *paid the rent until the end of the lease* out of spite. While you shouldn't make big decisions out of anger, you are obviously a very smart and rational person, and you know how to not to irreparable damage to your relationships and life just because you're angry. Kudos to you for that.",

            "It's always amazing to me how entitled people feel to someone else's money ESPECIALLY if that money is a windfall. Get a referral bonus for getting a friend a job?

He mocked your purchases and wanted nothing to do with it until you won. The he suddenly decided he w as entitled.\n\nI think this says a lot about how he views your relationship.

Then, you're stuck with, as you said, parking and upkeep on a car that you're not going to use. \n\nYou did a good thing by paying your rent up for the next few months.

He will think he is smarter than you?   \nI'm making a bunch of worst case assumptions but this is a bad relationship.

You actually spent your money in a smart, intelligent way and if he wants a damn car, he can go out get a job and buy a damn car.  \n\nWhat the hell?

It was your money, you had the right to do whatever you wanted but the moment you had any financial freedom you both clashed. What is the plan when you both need to one day get a car, bigger item or some dream goal? Fall apart? You need to re-evaluate the relationship. \n\nAs honourable as charity is. You are living paycheck to paycheck. Having a nest egg for a (cough) breakup or rainy day would have been a wiser move. You had to dispose of your money rather than keep it, due to pressure. It would have been wiser to deal with the relationship, than with removing the money. Now you still have the same problem. You don't financially see eye to eye. At least you have your rent down. \n\n",

Your boyfriend is the one fucking in an upward direction.\n\nYou're not married. Ergo he has zero say in your financial decisions.\n\nIf he gives you problems about it you can tell him that when he wins the lottery he can do what he likes with the money.

You've done nothing wrong, he was not entitled to any of it and you were nice enough to even consider it.  If he throws a strop over it, tell him to try living on his own for a while and see how much for granted he's taking what you already do for him.",

That's not even meant as a knock on her spending habits. Existing bills are more important than hypothetical ones. That's how you avoid letting what you own own you.",
            "First off, you did not fuck up.  It's your money, you won it with zero support from him.  You can throw it in the ocean and he doesn't have any right to stop you.\n\nSecond, dump his ass.  Sounds like a terrible mooch.",

            "This was probably the smartest thing you could do with the money you won, and I hope if I was ever in the same position I would use it in a similar way. \nHe never contributed to the cost of buying lotto tickets and had told you he thought it was stupid. It was never his money to spend. Only yours. Nothing to come clean about. \n",
            "Ooh honey this guy is manipulating you left and right and when he doesn't get his way he acts like a spoiled child! Please rethink your relationship. You deserve so much better-even if that is being alone, it would be so much better!",
            "It sounds like there is resentment from your financial situation. Your boyfriend was bitter from the very start when you would spend your money on lottery. Now it paid off and he's bitter that you have the power on how to spend it. The lines of communication between you two are very underdeveloped. A healthy relationship does not try to guilt or embarrass the other person into doing anything, that is a sure sign of immaturity and lack of communication. The money isn't the issue here. ",
            "He insults you and calls you stupid for buying lotto tickets, dismisses your reasons for buying it, says he does want any money if she wins and then as soon as you win starts getting angry and says he's entitled to some of it.\n\nMy girlfriend buys tickets every week and even though I know that she most likely won't win anything It's a small price to have a bit of hope, excited and something to look forward to. If she won I'd would never expect her to give me a single penny, that's her money and she deserves it. That's how he should have acted, he's a dick. I'm not going to advise you to break up with him or anything. But in the end, people rarely change, consider how he will react to bigger things in life if you decide to make a family with this guy.\n\n\n",
            "I understand why he would want a car. I see his point. I have had the privilege of owning a car since I was 16. I started a job that didn't allow me to drive my clients around due to my \"bad driving record\" 16-23 4 accidents and 8 tickets.  I had to take the bus and other methods of transport, I am grateful to have my car. It makes getting around so much easier and allows more freedom. So I see his point. On the other hand you won the money, not him. I don't think you should have donated to charity all though very Kantian of you, I feel you could use the money at the moment. You should have both agreed on something you wanted and spent half of it on that. Goodluck. It's always a fucked up situation in times like these.",
            "Why haven't you already broken up with him?",
            "You spent it on rent.\n\nGood, now you can start saving up for something. It's your money. I'm sure if you got him a car you'd end up paying for it. ",
            "Honestly, I think you made a wise decision here. The only real question is if having a car would have made things a lot simpler for you. If the public transit is working, then keep using it. He was being childish about the whole thing, and the truth is he is just your boyfriend. He has no say in the matter. The fact of the matter is he was overacting about the entire situation and you made a financial decision on what to do with your money. You paid up your rent to the end of the year. That is money that can now be saved, invested, or whatever else you want to do with it. Not only that, you helped out some charities. If he wants a car so badly, he should save up and buy one himself. he can be mad all he wants. At the end of the day, it's your money and your decision. ",
            "You didn't do anything wrong. Even if your donation was done out of spite, it's still doing good in this world. If he continues to act like a child, treat him like one and break-up with him.",

            "Why would you share the money with him to begin with?",
            "Good job. You did something both financially prudent as well as generous.",
            "He's your boyfriend not your husband that money belongs to you. You aren't legally required to give him anything or buy anything for him.",
            "The issue they haven't been. He's been mooching off her",
            "So I'm trying to find things in his favor. He studies a lot. That's good.\n\nI'm not sure a whole lot else.\n\nThis was your money, and you spent it on GOOD THINGS.",
            "Dude sounds like a prick. Keep the money, you won it, not him.",
            "You did a responsible adult thing, then a generous adult thing. Holy fuck I hope if I ever find myself in the same situation I do just what you did, you're amazing. He's an entitled baby, tell him what you did. If he can't handle it time to kick him to the curb.",
            "you didnt mess up, girl.\n\nit is your money.\n\nyour asshole boyfriend is an asshole.  he thinks hes entitled to it? he wasnt.  it is your choice when you decided how to spend it.\nyou did a selfless thing by donating some and you did a great job in taking care of yourself.  \n\nhe embarassed you on purpose in front of the car guy.\n\nwhat an asshole\n\nhonestly, money brings out people's true colors,\nI would probably end up dumping him because hes not the person who would be best suited to be with you, since you are a good person, and he is an asshole",
            "I think donating to charity was stupid. You could have invested whatever it was.  But, you didn't fuck up and you don't need to \"come clean\" That wasn't his money and you don't owe him any of it. He sounds like a dick anyway. ",
            "Your boyfriend sounds like a childish twat. Unless you can name one redeeming quality, I would dump him. His free ride is over.",
            "I don't think I would have donated it to spite him. I think that was you actively trying to hurt him and I am unsure your relationship will survive that. However, what he did was worse and I don't see how your relationship can survive that either. He's not entitled to any of it, he has disparaged you for taking the risks needed to win it, and he thinks he can bully you out of your money. For me, I wouldn't have done anything to spite him -but I would leave. No one should be treated that way. he acted like a jealous child. Better you know now he is not marriage material. ",
            "why did you give it away to charity??? you should have kept it locked up in savings or IRAs!!!",
            "Yea you did fuck up by donating the money and paying his half of the rent (as well as your own) But objectively, wtf?\n\nYou spend all this money and time purchasing lotto tickets, so you win and then donate all the money? I'm not a selfish person or anything but this is kind of backwards logic. From where I'm standing you needed that money and one argument over a car makes you dismiss it? I'm not one to judge you or tell you how to spend your money but it just doesn't add up that you would put all that time/energy into playing the lotto- win and then give it away over a petty fight.  So either your trying to look good on the internet or your trying to please  your bf to an embarrassing extent. All the power and respect to the charity you chose.. but it just isn't the most logical thing to do.\n\nOn the other hand your boyfriend has no right \"guilting\" you or what not into buying a car. ITS YOUR MONEY. You shouldn't let people manipulate you like that. I wouldn't feel bad about anything- he's throwing a tantrum because he's jealous. He's a nay sayer who put you down for doing something - then you succeed and he wants a piece of the pie. Did he do one thing to celebrate this accomplishment with you? Like buy you a drink or dinner to show his happiness. Sounds like a great guy!......\n\n\nBest of luck.\n"

So it thought I was reposting.\n\nOriginal :https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/43gv9g/my_25f_husbands_27m_old_friend_25m_told_me_my/?sort=new\n\nSince a lot of you were wondering what happened. \nAfter not being home since 11am till the next day at 7pm, I went to my moms place around 5ish because I was so shaken. I was going to have a panic attack. I called everyone who I thought would know where he is but no one did. I was thinking about filing a missing persons report like some of you said but by that time it was 7 and he called me saying he was home and literally hung up the phone. I got there as fast as I could.\n\nI get in the house and most his shit is packed, so I assume he came in before. I started crying and he just sat on the couch while I yelled at him. He said absolutely nothing . just when I started feeling bad, the friend we saw at the wedding comes out my bedroom holding boxes. I lost it and yelled at him. Called him every fucking name in the book. My husband tried telling me stop but I told him I wouldn't until he told me what was going on. I told him to tell his friend to get out of my house so we could discuss it. So he left.\n\nI asked him if he was gay and he said he is but didn't know how to deal with it. Apparently, he married me because I was in love with him and he \"felt bad\". When I asked if he cheated on me, he said yes, with the same friend. They met at a bar and slept together. The friend didn't know he was married and wanted a relationship. My husband said he fell in love with him and wanted to be with him but couldn't so they drifted apart a year later. The wedding was the time they met after all that time and That's when he realized my husband was married.\n\nHe told me he initially left to give his friend (Matthew) a piece of his mind for telling me, but I'm assuming he went there , fucked him, and then they took a shower and slept together because he was dressed in someone else's clothes and clearly looked well slept and fine. Better than before actually. While I looked like an absolute mess with bags under my eyes and my face was fucking breaking out.  I have never been so infuriated and sad in my entire life I have absolutely no energy left in me. I told him to take his stuff and we're getting divorced. And all he said was \"I'm sorry it has to be this way but at least be a little nicer to Matthew for forcing me to come out so we can each be happier\".  So he clearly cares more about him than he ever did about me and I'm apparently a pity case. He left with his new boyfriend and I'm certain theyre moving in together now. I have been sitting on my bed crying my eyes out and having a massive headache since then. I really don't know how to live without him, I love him and despite all of that, hes done so many amazing things and I honestly can't let go. I don't live at our place anymore even though he said I could have the house. I've been staying at my moms place because everything reminds me of him. Before he left he told me he did love me, just in a \"different way\". I don't know what to do anymore...\n\nThanks for all the kind words and advice, it was comforting to read.\n\ntl;dr: husband is gay, were getting a divorce\n\n",

            "Your first steps should be to the doctor for a full panel std test and to a lawyer. \n\nWhat he did is really shitty and there's no excuse for it. I know you are devastated and you have every right and reason to be. And as awful as this is to think of right now I promise one day you will be grateful this happened. That 'new boyfriend' just saved you. You deserve someone who will be completely honest and madly in love with you. Hopefully you both realize what a scumbag your husband is and leave his toxicity behind. He doesn't deserve another second of your time. ",
            "He handled this awfully. Gutless and spineless. There's no excuse for his actions. Lying to himself is one thing, but why get married to you? And lead you on when he knew he was confused???\n\n> And all he said was \"I'm sorry it has to be this way but at least be a little nicer to Matthew for forcing me to come out so we can each be happier\". So he clearly cares more about him than he ever did about me\n\nWhat a piece of shit. Matthew isn't some selfless hero. He outed your husband because he was hurt and wanted him. Now he has him.\n\n> Before he left he told me he did love me, just in a \"different way\". I don't know what to do anymore...\n\nOP, as devastating as this is protect yourself financially. Some men go scorched off once they no longer have feelings for their wives and have a new SO. He feels guilty now but all the \"new relationship energy\" is undercutting empathy for you. He will care less about being \"fair\" as time goes on. Talk to a lawyer. Divide your assets.",
            "\"Please be nice to the person I'm cheating on you with\".\n\nWhat an asshole.",
            "Jesus. Fucking. Christ. Jesus Christ. \n\n>Apparently, he married me because I was in love with him and he \"felt bad\". \n\nOh my *god,* OP. Oh my god. What a heart-breaking, humiliating thing to hear. I am so sorry you're going through this. I am trying to not jump to eviscerating this guy because it can't be easy to be that deep in the closet by oh my *god* how could he. How fucking could he.\n\n>And all he said was \"I'm sorry it has to be this way but at least be a little nicer to Matthew for forcing me to come out so we can each be happier\". \n\n**MOTHERFUCKING WHAT?!?!?!** Forget everything I said about trying to not eviscerate him. Fuck this dude eight ways from Sunday. How DARE he demand you be NICE to the guy he's *having an affair with.* \n\nOP, I'm not even entirely sure what advice to give. This is so fucked up. I guess it's time to just move on and get this piece of shit out of your life. Maybe therapy? I think I'd need therapy after this. Ugh.",
            "Who the hell brings their new love interest to help move stuff out of the house whilst breaking up with his wife?! On top of the deceit this struck me as such a cowardly, mean and selfish thing to do.\n\nAt the very least he should have had a long conversation with OP and explained himself and let her have all her questions answered, instead of bringing the new bf and having him present for the whole thing. What a jerk.\n\nOP, I'm sure it hurts like hell but if there's a silver lining here, it's that you are still young and don't have children. Give yourself time to grief and confide in someone you trust. I wish you all the best.",

            "> Apparently, he married me because I was in love with him and he \"felt bad\"...\"I'm sorry it has to be this way but at least be a little nicer to Matthew for forcing me to come out so we can each be happier\"\n\nThis entire thing makes my blood boil. \n\nWho the fuck does this douchebag think he is? Trying to excuse what is clearly his own decisions to cheat on you, multiple times, and trying to defend a guy who continued to pursue him *after* he knew he was married? \n\nIt doesn't matter whether or not he was gay. Your soon-to-be-ex-husband *chose* to marry you. He *chose* to lead you on, rather than just calling off the engagement and wedding, and being open and honest with you. By doing so, he needs to own up to his own decisions. Honestly, all of this is *his* fault, because he chose the path of lying, deception, manipulation, and cowardice. \n\nHe chose to use you as a \"beard\", just so he could turn around and fuck Matthew. From his words and actions, it's obvious that he never truly cared about you enough to treat you like an actual, human being, instead of a tool to use \"because he didn't know how to deal with being gay\". Due to that, he is nothing more than a shitstain, along with Matthew, in my eyes.\n\nThey're both disgusting, shitty people. Time to burn this bridge to the fucking ground, and never look back.\n\nI also second getting a full-panel STD test, as well as speaking to a divorce attorney, both as soon as possible.",
            "I'm gay as well and to be honest, this guy is complete trash. I'm so sorry, and I hope you find someone who truly loves you. Best of luck. ",
            "Looking at the bright side, you could've found this out 10 years from now after you had kids together. While your husband is absolutely a coward, this could've ended up a lot worse. ",
            "I am so sorry. This same thing happened to me a few years ago with my partner. It hurt me more than I can say, but I can tell you that these feelings aren't permanent. \n\nHis attempts to make you feel bad for what he did are just laughable. Can he honestly say that if he had been truthful with you in the beginning, that you would have kept pursuing him? No, he lied to you and trapped you. My ex's opinion of himself is so high that he considers what he did to be a favor to me. Like I would have been alone and tragic for the rest of my life if he hadn't thrown \"pity sex\" my way. Please. I was so happy before I met him, and I'm even more happy now. Partly because I now know what it is to have sex with someone who cares about me.\n\nI don't know about you, but when I feel bad for someone, my instinct is not to prey on them and lie to them. How does that make sense?\n\nHis cruel treatment of you is not a reflection of you or your worth. The only reason he's able to treat you this way is that he has Matthew to fall back on now. Your husband is a weak and pathetic scumbag, who will never truly love another person. Matthew may think he's won something, but your husband has got to be one of the most selfish people alive. They deserve one another.",
            "You deserve some one that wants to be with you. You'll get through this OP! ",
            "Oh i was right, it makes me sad that i know a lot of cases like this one. Your ex husband is a coward and didnt deserve you, the people who do that are pieces of shit. You do know how to live, you just dont want to and that's ok, you will feel really bad obviously but with time you will learn that was for the best because he could have left you with a kid like a lot of other cases i know, or made you spend your entire life with him living a lie. So at least this happened now than never. ",
            "I'm sorry your soon to be exhusband was a lieing scumbag. He lied to you about who he was, you are not a pity case you were lied to for years. Fuck that guy. Get therapy for your self to deal with the betrayal of your trust. Your still young your life isn't over. This hurts but you will recover and yoi will move on and you will be awesome with out that lieing scumbag dragging around after you.",

            "What a piece of shit.\n\nThe fact that he lacked any modicum of common decency is disgusting.  No grown person behaves this way, let alone someone you have shared a life with.  Sure, you're better off with out him, but it doesn't make it any easier to cope with the reality.\n\nFind a therapist to talk to that focuses on spouses of the newly out.  There are also support groups available.  \n\nDo not let him crush your spirit.  Develope a support system that will help you heal from this shit monster of a man.   Good luck.",

I think the other comments have covered what to do pretty well, so I wanted to point some other things out. [Although, extra emphasis on lawyering up. COVER YOUR ASS.]\n\nThat being said, you are in a great position to live the rest of your life. I don't expect this comment to fill you with joy; but I hope that after you've properly mourned that relationship, you can consider this sentiment.\n\n1. You're young. 25 is young. You have so much of your life ahead of you. Don't be consumed with ideas that it's too late to achieve the things you want. Hell, I'm 25 and there's no one in my life I can see myself marrying. But a lot can happen in just a few years. Similarly, if you weren't working before, it's not too late to prepare yourself for a career. You don't need years of experience to make a livable wage; there's no shame in getting a degree at 30. (If you choose to go that way. Maybe you have a degree already, but I'm trying not to assume.)\n\n2. If what he said about the house stands, YOU HAVE A GODDAMN HOUSE. Most 25 yr. olds don't have a house. Don't like living there because of the memories? Sell it at an optimal point and use that money to propel you into the future. \n\n3. You haven't contracted the blood-sucking, 25-year disease... er, I meant kids. Seriously, not having to deal with this asshole on ANY basis is a major boon. And you can make decisions purely in your best interest. Enjoy the freedom!\n\n4. You had no part in this decision.

So, he did what everyone expected of him. He found a girl, got married and started a family. My grandparents had three daughters, and after almost 20 years of marriage, my grandpa left my grandma for a man.\n\nMy badass grandma moved back to her hometown with three girls in tow. She found a job, bought a house and worked her ass off. She was a single mother, working full time and she went back to school to get her masters degree. All three of her daughters went to university (one of my aunts actually has two degrees). She remarried, to a really great guy.\n\nAnd my grandpa? He's around, and he always paid child support, etc. But (not surprisingly) he's always had a weird relationship with his kids. He has since told my mom that he regrets the way he treated my grandma.

            "You have my deepest sympathies. \n\nI have several older gay male friends who were from an era that being gay was considered the absolute worst thing \"that could happen to you\" (as if some external force made you gay); they were so deeply in the closet they couldn't even admit things to themselves. People married pretty young then and they all wound up either married or with serious relationships with women in their early 20's. However, they handled the situation with class once they figured things out - they told their SOs directly, did everything they could to be good fathers (if they had kids) and as supportive as possible of their ex. They also didn't fuck around on them while they were sorting things out.\n\nOn the other hand, my best friend (a gay man) always thought something was off about his brother in law and couldn't put his finger on it. After his sister was away on vacation with her and the b-i-l's two young children, she came home to a worried neighbor telling her a strange man had stayed at her house almost every day she was gone. She confronted her husband, who - with not the slightest hint of remorse or empathy - flatly told her he was gay, had known a long time and was fucking someone else. \n\nHe moved out soon after, still expressing zero sympathy for his now-ex wife and has been a selfish prat thereafter who barely sees his kids. His son (my best friend's nephew) struggled with his own sexuality, not wanting to admit he was gay even to himself because he associated gayness with his cheating, lying, neglectful father. He came out at 16 and looks to his uncle, my best friend, as a positive role model for being who you are openly.\n\nThe moral of this story: some people are just pieces of shit. I have a lot of sympathy for people who genuinely had a hard time accepting their same-sex attraction (and even more for their now exes) but if he knew up front he was gay, he had no right to use you as his unwitting beard. There is no law that says if you're not ready to come out, you have to marry someone of the opposite gender and \"play house\" either.\n\nI'll just add bisexual F here, because...everyone else was identifying!!!

She had used me to try to make herself not gay. She abused me because she needed an outlet for her confusion. She met another girl a couple months before we got engaged. She had a relationship with her for 2.5 years, while keeping one with me. She blamed it all on her being gay and said her confusion over it justified how she treated me.\nIt's not the same as your situation, OP, but just know you can rebound.

How could he think that condemning you to a practically sexless marriage based off a lie was what you wanted? \n\nFurthermore, I'm shocked Matthew wants anything to do with your ex.. He was dating Matthew for a *year* and never said that he was married until he was forced to. He was lying to both of you. If I ever found out that my casual relationship of a year was married, I certainly wouldn't be helping them move out or jumping back into bed with them. \n\nI know you feel like shit now. But I'd be *very* surprised if your ex's relationship with Matthew doesn't crash and burn in a few weeks or months. It's a relationship based off a lie. Your ex lies to people and withholds information from them so he can get what he wants. He is cowardly and selfish. Not good qualities to have in a partner. \n\nYou are going to hurt for a very long time. But you will be okay. You will get there. \n ",
            "OP, I am so, so sorry. I have also gone through this as well.\n\nI married my first real boyfriend at 20, he enlisted in the Army, and I moved four states away from my family to be with him there. As soon as we moved things changed and he was awful to me. I suspected cheating and turns out his interest was men. I confronted him, but he denied and denied it. \n\nFinally, one night at 3:00 a.m. he woke me up and took me outside. We smoked before he broke down crying and admitted he was gay and always had been, but didn't want his father and mother to know, so he married me since we got along well. I was sad and angry, but I felt like I couldn't be mad at him for at least being honest finally. \n\nLong story short, I stayed there a bit longer before he got really nasty with me and basically trapping me in our apartment (we only had one car and I had no job.) I had to call my parents to beg to let me move back home and help me buy a flight back. It only lasted six months and took a whole year for him to sign divorce papers (he wanted to stay legally married for the Army money...I absolutely did not.)\n\nIt's been five years now since I legally became divorced from him. It took about two years to really recover from the feeling of deceit/anger/sadness/and failure I felt following that. I promise you it gets better with each passing day, though some better than others. \n\nI wish you so much luck and love. If you ever need someone to talk to, PM me.",
            "You have to let go. He couldn't care enough about you to even tell you how he really felt before getting married. He wasted your time, and would have continued to do so had his \"friend\" not outed him. There is nothing worth holding onto, and if you try you'll only hurt yourself.",
            "I'm so sorry this happened to you, and in such an absolutely shitty way. \n\nThings will get better from here, when you heal yourself and decide to open up again you'll have a more rewarding relationship with someone who is worthy of your time and affection. \n\nEverything happens for a reason. ",
            "This is just terrible, I'm so so sorry. I know this seems like the end of the world but you will get through this, I promise. If you need a pick me up, watch the show Frankie and Grace. It's about two women whose husbands of many, many years decide to leave their wives because they're gay. It's meant to be a funny show but there's a lot of comfort for people who are going through something similar. ",
            "This is the thing, if you are finding yourself don't marry until you know who you are!  There is no excuse for this in today's day and age.  \n\nI have a small amount of sympathy for someone who was born in an age where there was a danger of coming out.  Though I think it is shitty to change your mind half way through a marrage.  But there is not excuse anymore in the western world today and we should all be happy about that.  ",
            "You know, whenever I see these kind of posts on this subreddit...people hesitate to paint the SO as a bad person....but you're totally justified in being pissed and he is a bad person. \n\nHe knew he was gay. He knew he was using you as a shield. He knew he was toying with your emotions. He knew he was getting married to someone of a gender he's not attracted too. He knew when he was cheating. He knew for the two years he was married to you that this was not okay. \n\nBut he did it anyway. \n\nWhat an asshole, he doesn't get to hide behind the \"well you should be happy for me because I can finally be myself bit.\"\n\nYou be pissed, you get a lawyer, and you don't feel guilty at all about going at it with this sob who clearly used you.

            "Wow! Matthew saved you so much future heartache for letting you know off the bat. He is insane to still be involved with your husband after what he did to you.\n\nYour soon to be ex-husband sounds like a horrible person. He could have let you down easy instead of marrying you. Get a good lawyer, get yourself tested, and definitely move somewhere else! Don't blame yourself for this, there was no way for you to know.",

Your stbex was a terrible person to have put you thru this charade.\n\nMore important than being stuck in a shitty situation is the way you deal with said shitty situation. Good luck with everything you will be going thru, OP. ",
            "It may make it worse, but remember how he treated you and how he cared more for his BFs feelings than yours, and not only that but he had the nerve to bring him to your house, and defend him after you've been blindsided by his sexuality, not to mention that he disappeared without a word for 30 hours.\n\nAs you try to get over him, please remember how he treated you. It should hopefully make it easier to get over him.",

He was so wrapped up in his own pity-party that he completely disregarded your feelings, making an already shitty situation that much worse for you.  I can't believe how poorly he handled this.\n\nI know you miss him and I know it hurts right now.  But you are still so young.  When you feel ready, go out, have fun, and try again.  It feels like it right now, but know that your life is not over.  Know there is a lifetime of happiness and joy ahead of you, and it's because you won't be living a lie for the rest of your life.",

            "Wow. Your future ex-husband is a gigantic asshole. I'm not a fan of people being forced to come out but I don't condone them leaving false lives and cheating, either. You're well rid of him, tbh, I actually feel sorry for Matthew, though I'm side-eyeing that he wants to be with a man who would stay closeted and cheat on his wife. \n\nTake care of yourself, turn to your friends and family for support. ",
            "It's one thing to find out you're gay. It's quite another to cheat on your partner. If he handled this like an adult and spoke to you about his being gay as the first thing he did, perhaps you both could have worked something out, or at least things could have been resolved easier (and this is even forgiving his committing to you in the first place, when he was unsure himself). \n\nBut the fact that he cheated on you is unacceptable and immature. Regardless of his orientation, he should have acted like an adult.",

            "Although it's an awful thing to go through, it's also a blessing in some ways. You deserve better than someone who married you because he \"felt bad\"... Someone who will love you in return and put just as much effort into the relationship as you will. You mentioned in your other post that he didn't want kids. If you do want a family, you now have the opportunity to do so with someone who wants that as well. No one deserves to be lied to and cheated on. Mathew is a jerk for telling you the way he did, but at least you know. Although it will take time and healing, I wish you all the best as you rebuild your life and move forward. It sucks, but it's better to know now than to stay with a jerk and a liar. ",

And I think you are very lucky that he told you (obviously not lucky that this situation occurred at all), otherwise who knows how long it could have gone on for.

It's too easy for us on the Internet to be mad at him, but we have zero clue as to who he is, what his life is like, what led him to hide shit.

Fuck him, you are young and you'll get so much better",
            "You are so lucky to get this cleared out of the way so soon in your life actually. I would say that, although probably for the wrong reasons, Matthew saved your life. Please get all the support possible from your family, and move through this. You can still love him, but that chapter has been done.\n\nAs a bi person, I can say that the closet is a horrible place to be. Understand from his point of view that he tried to hide his sexuality, which is a great force in a human psyche. You cannot hide it, it only ends up with depression and unhappiness when its repressed. Of course he is not going to act in the best way. It may be difficult to hear, but you were his beard. He probably did love you, more than \"as a friend\". But he could never enjoy being sexual or committed to you, and he never saw an out for it. Your life is a hell now but his has been a hell for the last 20 years. (I'm assuming he was deep in the closet for being gay but marrying a woman)\n\nHe did wrong you and for that you should get legal compensation (especially if he was the financial support) But know that in some time, both of you will heal from the wounds of this thing and thank god won't leave a broken home in your wake.",

I used to dress like shit, I was perfectly content wearing my gym clothes everywhere and stretched the dress code as much as possible for work. My girlfriend works in the fashion industry so she helped me buy some clothes that fit me better and looked nicer without being out of my comfort zone so I was really thankful for that. I kept all the same gym clothes, sweatpants, Panama pants, old t shirts and sweaters and jeans etc as well as all of my shoes because I figured they'd be fine to wear around the house or to work out because I don't really care how I look for that. I told her she could buy clothes for me if she wants because she knows what I like which is maybe where I went wrong. \n\n\nLast week I went on training for work and it was my birthday while I was gone. I got back and my girlfriend had  donated all of my old clothes that she hadn't picked out and replaced it with new stuff. I tried to act grateful at first but honestly I'm fucking pissed off. I don't want to wear shitty stiff jeans that stain the seats in my truck blue and the running shoes suck for actually running. Even the sweatpants are kinda tight which in my mind defeats the purpose of wearing sweatpants. She got rid of all my old t shirts that I bought at games and replaced them with plain colours but now I have barely any tshirts at all. And she spent a ton of money doing this. I know the jeans alone are over $300 and and the shoes probably cost over two grand. She gets a small discount on this stuff but still, she probably spent upwards of 5k on all the new clothes, I looked up some of the brands and it's all really high end. \n\n\nI told her I wish she hadn't gotten rid of my old stuff and she said I would have kept wearing it so she had to but offered to go get it back from the thrift store. Well the thrift store apparently sends their donated clothes away to get wasted and then they get sent to various locations throughout our city so basically no one has any idea where my clothes are and they're as good as gone. \n\n\nThe reason I'm posting is she's now mad at me for being ungrateful and says I'm being shitty and should respect and appreciate her more. But yeah I'm not really that thankful because she got rid of all my shit. Yesterday I told her not to talk to me until she came home with my bean boots that I've been breaking in for years which she actually was able to find but it caused a huge fight. Am I being a dick for being pissed about this? \n\n\n**tl;dr**: my girlfriend replaced all of my clothes with nicer higher end versions and I'm pissed off about it. \n\n\nEdit-this is getting a lot of responses so I'll add this here to clear things up. I don't dress like a slob, my clothes don't have holes, I'm not wearing lame graphic tees, and everything I've worn out of the house for the last three years (with the exception of going to the gym) has been gf approved. Also I'm not going to break up with her over this, it sucks but not really break up worthy. ",

What she did was incredibly selfish and more for her benefit than yours. The reason why I know she didn't do this for you is because she didn't replace your clothes with choices that would fit with your lifestyle and comfort level. Like instead of the stiff jeans she bought you, she could of gone with a pair of tailored pants made of sweatshirt fabric in a couple of colors. And running shoes you can't run in? How was that suppose to work?\n\nThrowing out your clothes without your permission was her way of ensuring you couldn't go back to wearing your go-tos. That is some controlling shit right there... Has she ever expressed embarrassment about the way you dress? This seems like a really passive agressive way to get you to change your style without having to talk to you about it. When you think you can stay calm, ask her point blank, and keep asking if she tries to deflect from the question.

I've helped him pick out basics that are more appropriate for work (he works in a lab, so still basics but with no holes)/nice dinners/special occasions.  However, I never once suggested getting rid of anything he has.  When we hang out on weekends or go on hikes, out come the holey, comfortable, broken-in clothes.  If he's comfortable, he's happy.

It might be that she's doubling down on her fuck up, but since she's also taking steps to try and fix it, that doesn't seem like the case.\n\nSo the reason she's turning it around is that she doesn't know how to deal with just how badly she fucked up.  She's needing reassurance that she's not the worst person ever.\n\nHere's the thing, and this applies almost universally when dealing with anyone who made a mistake: you need to give her an out.  You're mad, you've got every right to be, and she knows it.  You can use that righteous anger to change how she views your relationship.  But if you end up pushing a perspective that has her as an irredeemable fuck-up, you can't really expect her to accept that.\n\nDon't get mad just to get mad.  Don't rage.  Use it productively.  If you're not able to do that, then take some time to cool down.\n\nMaybe you can't ever forgive her and it's a dealbreaker anyway.

            "I might be alone on this, but I think BOTH that she probably shouldn't have done it AND I would be so happy and grateful if my girl did this. I don't give a fuck about clothing, and it's a pain to have to rework my wardrobe.",
            "Okay, I see both points here.\n\nIf you had expressed to her that something was special or had sentimental value and she got rid of it then I 100% see your point that she should have at least checked with you before getting rid of something. You would think that in the three years you've been together she would have acknowledged that some things are important.\n\nAdditionally, part of the fun of buying clothes for someone is to go with them and have them participate in the actual selection. They're still clothes that YOU'RE going to wear, some input would still be good, no matter how knowledgeable in fashion she is.\n\nBut I also see her point of view, that it seemed like you said that she can replace your wardrobe, and $5k is a pretty decent amount for a total clothing overhaul. She was probably excited that you trust her and got caught up in the process. \n\nI think you could have both handled things better. What do you mean you told her to \"not talk to you until she came home with your bean boots\"? That sounds pretty awful...\n\nThe bottom line is that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. She meant to surprise you and for you to be excited. You need to acknowledge that he getting rid of your old clothes was not a malicious act.\n\nSo what problem are you trying to solve? \n\n1. You want some of your things back.\n\n2. You want to stop fighting with your girlfriend (I assume).\n\n3. You want to work out a system of communication that makes it more clear where you both draw lines beyond which you will feel like your personal space has been disturbed. \n\nFirst, I would say that you both need to take a step back and think about what has happened. Did she realize your tshirts had sentimental value? Did she realize that the bean boots were expensive and you'd been breaking them in? Did she realize the running shoes she bought you are not really good for running? That this is important to you?\n\nIf she realized that these were important and just doesn't care then you should reconsider the relationship.\n\nIf she didn't realize that she was getting rid of things that were important or sentimental then you need to address the problem in a constructive way.\n\nInstead of demanding that she go out seeking the things she lost on her own as a way of retribution, offer to do it together. I realize you might feel like you shouldn't have to put effort into restoring your things, but a) going with her will show her how important these things really were and b) if you feel that this relationship is worth fixing then you should try to show kindness and compassion back to her.\n\nSit down together and make a list of the things that you feel you'd like to replace, and also a list of things that she got for you that you are unlikely to use (i.e. the running shoes/shorts).\n\nMaybe you can still return some of the items she purchased you and recoup some of the money she spent. Then you can use that toward trying to get back some of the things she gave away. You might not be able to get the exact tshirts back, but maybe you'll be able to buy replacements? Maybe if you go together to get new running shoes and workout clothes you can point out what you are looking for in clothing you use to work out in and she can find things that look nice but still meet your criteria.\n\nThis sounds like a misunderstanding and a breakdown in communication. I wouldn't give up three years of a relationship over something that happens to EVERYONE that has been in a long-term relationship at some point. \n\nI hope you get your things back - I'm very sentimental about my clothes and I would be very upset if my husband got rid of things without my consent. But I also hope you're able to find a more effective way to talk to your girlfriend (and vice versa) so that this doesn't happen again in the future. ",
            "My wife did something similar in regards to the end result, but she took about 7 years to accomplish the task and was extremely tactful and slow in her modification of my slovenly lifestyle.\n\nI feel like your GFs heart was in the right place, but she made the wound and ripped off the band-aid all at the same time.",
            "You're not wrong for being upset, but you need to decide if these actions are indicative of the relationship- I.E. is this a deal breaker for you? \n\nOr if it's something you guys can communicate about, have some healthy boundaries understood, and move forward.  ",

Sad fact, but totally true.  When I nag about updating SO's wardrobe, it comes from a place of love and concern.  I **hate** the idea that people are judging him, or thinking less of him because of how badly he is dressed.\n\nEspecially in a professional environment.  We're talking money, here folks!!\n\n* she helped me buy some clothes that fit me better and looked nicer **without being out of my comfort zone** so I was really thankful for that. (*So she wasn't forcing anything on him*)\n\n*  **I told her she could buy clothes for me if she wants because she knows what I like** which is maybe where I went wrong.\n\n* she spent a ton of money doing this. I know the jeans alone are over $300 and and the shoes probably cost over two grand. She gets a small discount on this stuff but still, she probably **spent upwards of 5k** on all the new clothes, I looked up some of the brands and it's all really high end. (*Literally my dream, but I get you, OP*)\n\n* offered to go get it back from the thrift store. (*Acknowledged her error, tried to make amends*)\n\n*  **she came home with my bean boots** that I've been breaking in for years which she actually was able to find (*Wow, she's really trying*)\n\nShe sounds like a hardworking girl, who was trying hard to please you.",
            "Wow, yeah she massively overstepped the mark here. Who throws away their SOs entire wardrobe. That's just fucking weird. I can sympathise, it can take years for clothes to get that truly comfortable lived in feel. \n\nHonestly, I would just show her this thread. Her behaviour is weird and controlling and she needs to understand that what she did is not OK. ",
            "Id be more pissed she spent multiple thousands of dollars on this. Must be nice to have that much disposable income to spend on clothing. Seems to be a warning sign to me of a lack of self control financially and otherwise. \n\nI think the reality is she probably meant well by what she did but was shortsighted and certainly lacked empathy for you and your attached feelings to the things you own and that make you comfortable. I know as someone who wears the same 2 or 3 shirts and pairs of pants that even the most expensive things will probably not perfectly jive with how I feel being in the clothing. I just want things simple too. \n\nI think for you the anger is justified. Of course if you discuss this with her it's not that the anger is towards her intent to do something she saw as nice for you but rather the disregard for your feelings in the matter. ",
            "It was very generous of her to do this. It was also very controlling.",
            "Totally justified to be pissed off about it.  It's one thing to expect gratitude for buying someone clothing...it's another to expect gratitude for donating someone's clothing without their consent.\n\nHonestly it's just weird.  I don't know you or her, so take this with a bucketload of salt - but honestly, is she stable?  I mean...it's just really outside the realm of common decency to do what she did.  Obviously nice of her to get you new clothes, but you simply don't make decisions about another persons possessions without their consent.  My wife wouldn't even think to do that.",
            "Relationships are so complicated... Maybe she thinks if you are more presentable this will only benefit you in other areas of your life. Are you taking initiative yourself or...have you given the impression you don't care much either way so why shouldn't she take it upon herself to? Only you will really know the truth about all of this, if what she did indicates there are deep issues with her sense of right and wrong. Since you made the post, I would say she definitely overstepped and you guys need to have a very serious conversation. \n\nI'm saying this because I know that in relationships sometimes what a person does can seem outrageous to outsiders, but it is possible you are in fact lucky to have someone who even cares that much or takes the time. Up to you to figure all that out. ",
            "Is she out of her mind? I get buying you new stuff (you said she could) if she wants, but I cannot even imagine what went through her mind to make her donate your old stuff. \n\nAnd then she called you ungrateful? No, seriously, is there some kind of mental problem your GF has? Who would behave this way? \n\nThis, for me, would be a massive breach of trust. If she wanted to surprise you with new things and talk about what you might get rid of to make room, sure, of course, but this is just insane behavior. I would honestly be frightened to have her in my space. What's next? Coming home to a new couch? Cutting my hair in my sleep? Seriously, it's bizarre behavior. ",

            "There are honestly a couple of items in my closet that are butt-ugly and impractical and I almost never wear them, but I'd be so upset if they were thrown out because they're sentimental (sweaters I pilfered from my grandpa, a denim vest from my androgynous phase, etc.). If a partner binned them without warning, I would actually cry right in front of them. \n\nYour stuff is a tangible expression of you and it's totally against partner etiquette to trash stuff without explicit permission. You're not ungrateful (especially since you're making the effort to try to enjoy the clothes).",
            "My friend, the clothes are not the issue here. You guys are way off base on what your idea of good clothes are. If she is really into fashion, she will be for the rest of her life. If she spends thousands of dollars on shoes, she will for the rest of her life. You need to decide now if this is what you want, because if you don't draw a line in the sand, you will be upset....for the rest of your life. \n\nIf you get to wear the clothes you want, then it will just lead to spitefulness on her part, because she will not dress you how she wants. \n\nYour financial interests are conflicting with each other, and that may come to a head on much bigger issues, in my opinion. You all need to have a discussion on what you value in life. It sounds like this is going to be an ongoing issue.",

Where is that old green shirt I want to wear to work?\" \"In the box, babe, but why don't you put on that green shirt I got you?

At the very least ask her to apologize for her actions. Get some new comfort clothes as well",

            "I'm surprised more people aren't pointing out how controlling this behavior is. The GF basically is trying to control what her BF wears both in and out of the house. In a lot of relationships, this would be a big red flag for other control issues.  \n\nI would have a talk with her about how it's not about the clothing, it's about being able to make decisions about your own life with her input, instead of having the choices made for you. SOs are supposed to be partners, and she should have communicated with you about this instead of unilaterally making decisions about your wardrobe.  \n\nImagine if she were vegan and she tossed all your old food out of the house in favor of vegan options because that's what she wanted for you. Right now you're only kind of pissed because it's not an issue that you feel strongly about, but this kind of behavior applied to other areas of your life could become horrible.",

            "She got a gift for herself and called it a birthday present. You can be both appreciative of the thought and fucking pissed at the execution. \n\nTo her, I would explain that intention isn't all that matters. It affected you negatively, made you frustrated and upset, made you feel disrespected, and even if it was done with \"good intentions\" it has *still hurt you*. And she needs to apologize for how it actually affected you, and try to fix it if she can. \n\nAsk her if she can exchange some of the items to replace them for things that actually make sense for you. Tennis shoes, replace for a pair of actual running shoes, sweatpants that are actually comfortable, etc. Ask her if she understands why you're upset, and if she seems to get it, ask her not to do it again. Stress that you appreciate the effort and money it took to accomplish this, but that throwing your items away was disrespectful regardless, and that she needs to not throw your stuff away without asking. I would make sure to communicate using lots of \"I messages\" and stuff like \"when you threw away my clothing, I felt hurt and disrespected.\" \n\nI'm sure she's reacting extra poorly because it was an expensive gift and it wasn't well-received, but frankly it was executed so poorly that you couldn't appreciate the scope of the gift. It also seems a bit like she's trying to change you for her comfort and that's a red flag to me. I can't imagine throwing away my fianc\u00e9's shirts, even the ones that I hate, which are misshapen and worn to the point of holes. I honestly can't fathom doing that. \n\nThis doesn't necessarily have to be a relationship-ending incident. But it could be, if she can't understand and apologize for what she did wrong. It could be a sign of a greater issue, like a lack of respect. I wish you the best of luck. ",
            ">it sucks but not really break up worthy\n\nWhy? Your girlfriend is psychotic and controlling, to the point that I'd go so far as to say she has legitimate issues. She's manipulative as hell. This proves she will do anything in her power to control you, including going behind your back to get her way. And then she has the audacity to turn around and cry about how you don't respect her? I wouldn't respect her either. She just threw away all of your clothes, things with sentimental value, just because she didn't like it. It's clear who controls this entire relationship. Relationships are supposed to be equal - how would she feel if you went through all of her makeup and threw it away and replaced it, just because you don't like how she does hers? \n\nShe doesn't want a boyfriend, she wants a barbie doll. You weren't good enough, so she thinks she's upgrading you to be some fashionable model that she'd be more suited to date. \n\nTake back all the shit she bought, use the money to try and replace everything she trashed, then throw her out with the garbage.

Its about personal boundaries, and having them violated.\n\nIm sure your gf didnt mean any disrespect and that her intentions were good if clumsy, but when we are no longer 7 yrs old; the old: I didnt mean for that to happen (really : I didnt mean for you to react this way) -excuse doesnt really cut it anymore.\n\nAs adults we are supposed to be able to detect and respect other peoples boundaries. Going into a boyfriends closet, throwing all his clothes, from before me away, because I feel like it. Is not a good move. On any level.\n\nIt tells you something about her. It tells you she doesnt understand or appreciates boundaries if they get in the way of what she thinks is best for you.\n\nWhen you talk to her, try to make a point of it being about boundaries, and not about the specific clothes. - You must have lost some trust in her good sense, and some trust in her respect for you. These are consequences of her actions that must also be adressed.\n\n\nYou shouldnt be confusing the actual clothes, new vs. old debate, for what happened here. It has very little to do with the material stuff of cotton and wool. And everything to do with giving you space, autonomy and accepting things she doesnt have any input in, when it comes to your life. Your girlfriend either doesnt sense social boundaries, which is a big social disadvantage for her, and something she needs to be sensitive to going forward, or she simply disregarded yours because you dont get the consideration she would automatically grant others... which is obviously a big issue in a relationship.\n\nStuff can have sentimental value, beyond what other people can appreciate. I dont think that concept is hard to understand. I dont believe anyone can really be so insensitive, that they dont even consider that what they are doing, when throwing your old stuff out, might not be an alltogether great idea. Giving her the benefit of the doubt, I would say; she is not emotionally bright, or she is just very very insensitive. \n\nThe best thing she could do, is apologise profusely. That atleast would show some empathy and compassion. And the ability to recognise a mistake was made. - But your gf is not even doing that is she? You need to appreciate and respect her more right? - Everytime she does something inconsiderate, you should not call her out on it, instead, dig deep for that respect you feel for her, and get over it? \n\n\nIf somone had done that to me, I dont think I would have been able to trust their judgement going forward, and Im not sure I would even have been able to put it behind me.

I'm betting it won't stop with clothes, and if you dig enough into it, will find other aspects she may do this in, even if it's in a passive agressive manner.\n\nI'd say cool down a bit before trying to talk, just because it will be fight after fight, but I'm with you and feel you have a right to be pissed.",

However instead of listening to every other redditor here clamoring for a breakup, you should listen to yourself. \n\nDo you want to keep the relationship? \n\nThat is an important question. If your answer is 'Yes' then you will need to communicate and navigate this issue with your girlfriend with the intent of keeping the relationship. Perhaps this can be viewed as a learning moment between you and her where you both set your boundaries and communicate more clearly with each other. \n\nI think it is important for you to tell her that you want to be valued and loved and cared for *no matter what you are wearing.* If she only loves you when you wear nice clothes, that type of contingent love breeds resentment. Your girlfriend probably doesn't think she did anything wrong because our culture tells women that the men they date or marry should change themselves for their women. If you've seen the movie Don Jon this is a major theme of it. \n\nAlso, relaxing clothes are pretty easy to come by. Generic sweatpants and shirts are way cheaper than most of the items she bought you. Yes you had some sentimental value in your old clothes, but the value of those clothes vs your continued relationship is a decision you will need to make. \n\nI think you should talk with your girlfriend about what you both want in a relationship, what boundaries are acceptable, be willing to compromise a little bit (don't just flip over to one side entirely). \n\nHowever if you want to break up well then the advice for that is pretty straightforward. You will probably need to give some of the clothes and shoes back to her (not that you have to, but I think it would be a nice gesture of goodwill). ",

I'm not trying to devalue fashion designers in saying that; just that everyone's styles and perceptions are different, as with any art form.

The only reason she has for even being a little upset is, maybe she thinks OP not liking the stuff = insulting her career?\n\nBut that's like me being mad that my SO was upset, if I ripped the pages of their favorite books from their spines, and replaced it all with stuff I wrote.

Make it clear to her that you are okay with her ADDING to your collection, but that she's can't throw out/take away anything without clearing it with you first.

Maybe you looked four sizes bigger in the old clothes.   Maybe they were stained, ripped, beat up.   If she had the resources to improve your homeless look (not assuming you looked that way just arguing the point) then maybe she felt it was her duty to make you look respectable.\n\n\n\nI don't know.

Additionally, by throwing away my clothes it feels like you're trying to control me and that's what really bothers me. It really hammers in that thought that you don't care what I want. It's not that I don't appreciate the gesture but its just that the gesture doesn't take my feelings into account.

If I were in your position and all those were thrown out, I'd be crushed.\n\nShe clearly did not appreciate the value you gave them, even if they were old rags, but I also feel like she's not telling you all of her motivations for cleaning out your closet like that. Maybe she simply doesn't like those clothes around the house? Maybe she feels embarrassed that you wear those things, and doesn't want her co-workers knowing? Maybe she wishes you'd wear the clothing she bought more frequently, and knew throwing your old clothing out would lead to that? Those are the only reasons I could see her doing what she did and being so upset at your reaction.\n\nDon't give her an ultimatum or something like that, just sit down and have a talk with her.

Otherwise, she's being  a little controlling.\n\nEveryone has the right to determine (within budget) the image that they project to the world. That said, please understand that the creation of a brand new wardrobe takes time and effort as well as money, and so she is probably surprised and hurt at your (justifiable, but not really productive) anger over this.\n\nOr you could just break up with her and go back to lounging alone in your sweatpants.\n",

Yesterday I told her not to talk to me until she came home with my bean boots that I've been breaking in for years which she actually was able to find but it caused a huge fight. Am I being a dick for being pissed about this? \n\nNo, you're not being a dick for being pissed about this.\n\nYou're not being ungrateful, either. I think the issue here is that your GF sees the buying you new clothes, and throwing away your old clothes, as all part of the same act. So you reject one, and you're rejecting the other. In her mind, at least.\n\nBut that's not how it works. When you buy someone a gift, you don't go into their house and throw away the old thing the gift was intended to replace. You leave that up to the recipient.\n\nFurthermore, from the sound of it, she got rid of your old stuff for a really selfish reason -- because she doesn't *want* you to wear the old stuff. At all. Ever. \n\nSo she did do a really nice thing for you... but then she did an uncool selfish thing too. And she needs to understand these are two separate acts, which you view differently. ",

Either that, or you somehow gave her the impression that she could toss your old stuff.\n\nJust because she's a fashion expert, doesn't mean you suddenly aren't allowed agency over your own clothing choices.  Sure, she can help and add to the collection, but should never be just deciding what you can and can't keep without your input.

It just seems like a basic act of respect to make sure you aren't getting rid of something a person really wants to keep.  I'd be so upset if my lounge clothes (or anything else, really) got tossed without my permission.\n\nSo, no, you aren't a dick for being upset about this.  Try not to berate her about it though, she does seem remorseful if she was able to find your shoes.

In the beginning I mostly hid clothes that his mom gave him or that were very old. He has recently lost weight, so now I hide clothes that are too big for him. I don't really care what he wears at home, but don't want him to sell himself short by representing himself poorly in public. I've never thrown his stuff away because... It's his stuff?

            "As upsetting as this is, keep in mind that this is also not a one-off issue. (Reddit, the following is my interpretation of the gf's opinions, not my own.) Your gf is in the fashion industry, so appearances are very important to her. As her bf, how you dress is an extension of her own image. So this is not a one-time wardrobe update. This is indicative of her need to fully control your wardrobe going forward. Once you've combined finances, this also becomes a joint problem of how much money is appropriate to spend monthly on wardrobe updates, & whether she is currently going into credit card debt to update either of your wardrobes. This one time gift may have come from her own money (& again, you need to ask yourself if she can comfortable afford the amount she spent), but she's likely to see this as a joint funds expense in the future instead of her sole financial responsibility. It is likely to be a recurring argument unless you sort out immediately how much control she can have over your wardrobe & what money is to be put toward it.",

I'd be pissed too if someone gave away all my clothes and downsized my wardrobe without my input. Even more so that everything was replaced with brand new, expensive clothing that has to be broken in. Plus some of it won't even be wearable for every day, work out, or hands on activities. \n\nHave a talk with her. Ask her how she would feel if you replaced all of her stuff that she's had for years, shoes she had broken in just right, soft shirts, perfect dresses, etc., with brand new things that aren't quite her style without her input just because you thought it'd be nice. Because sure, it's a nice gift, but she could have easily asked you how you felt about her buying you clothes and taken you shopping. ",
            "She took it too far. What if your clothes had some minor sentimental value? She should have kept it bagged up and let you decide to keep a few comfy outfits and decide what charity to donate to. \n\nI have some raggedy tee-shirt from shows I've seen live that I sleep and lounge in that are priceless to me. I'd be livid. \n\nI'm not sure if it is dump her material, but you should go and get a few comfy pieces.  ",
            "I actually have a drawer of t-shirts that I love and collected at events and places that mean a lot to me, if my partner ever donated these I would be furious.  It would be a different thing if you refused to wear any of the new clothes, but you're putting forth positive effort. It's nice she was willing to go back and get everything from the thrift store, so hopefully you acknowledged that, but she did overstep and is probably feeling very guilty as well. Reward yourself with a few new t-shirts, thank her, take her out for a nice dinner as a thank you and understand that she did what she could to right the wrong and move on.",
            ">  I don't want to wear shitty stiff jeans that stain the seats in my truck blue \n\nI think most of the other comments in this thread are fantastic and pretty on-point re: the situation, so I wanted to take just a second to address this and hopefully help you resolve this particular issue.\n\nNo matter what anyone says, *you should be washing your jeans*. I've been into the raw denim scene for years, and I went through the phase that everyone does when they first start wearing raws--the whole \"Oh you shouldn't wash them, it'll kill the fades--just freeze them/use febreeze/only soak them in the tears of a child\" phase. \n\nHere's the thing about that: it's mostly bullshit. Yes, not washing jeans for a long time gives you higher contrast fading, but the majority of people don't really want high-contrast fades, they want more vintage style fading. \n\nWhat I do (and what I'd recommend you do) is to turn your jeans inside-out and wash them on delicate in the washing mashine with woolite dark, then hang dry. I do this every week or two, and I wear the jeans daily. Use cold water so as to minimize shrink (though if they feel too loose after a bit of wear, feel free to turn up the temperature to get them to snap back).\n\nIf you do this, within a few washes, you shouldn't have any more indigo bleed (exceptions: wet jeans + friction == some indigo is gonna come off).\n\nIn addition, the additional wash and wear time should accelerate the break-in. If they're heavyweight jeans (18oz or higher per yard of fabric), after break-in they'll feel more like sweatpants than jeans. Even if they aren't heavyweight, they'll eventually feel very, very comfortable. You just have to get them past the break-in period.\n\n\nFootnote: Also, as a guy that's pretty fashion-forward himself, I can't believe she got rid of your bean boots. They're not really my style, but they *are* pretty in style for the most part right now, and those kinds of boots just aren't something you throw out.",

            "It sounds like your GF was genuinely trying to help you, but homegirl really fucked up the execution of her kind gesture. Maybe she's watched too many episodes of What Not to Wear and thought all wardrobe makeovers should include chucking out the person's entire old wardrobe. But the thing is, the people on the show specifically consent to that; you didn't. She really, really should've set your old clothes aside and asked you what you couldn't live without before getting rid of anything.\n\nThat said, you've already stated this isn't worth breaking up over, which is good. You guys can get past this, maybe even come out of this stronger, but it's gonna take some work. Someone else on this thread floated the idea of asking her to replace some of the more sentimental items she got rid of, like your team shirts, and I think that's an excellent idea. It would also be good to go shopping for decent running shoes together to make sure you get some that actually suit your needs. You guys would likely benefit from working together to make your wardrobe something that you both agree on. ",

            "You guys have to have a serious conversation. Not a fight, no yelling but actually hearing each other out and making a compromise on both ends. \nShe thought she was doing a nice thing and didn't really think it would bother you . She probably feels shitty now for giving your clothes away instead of \" hey , here's all these new high end clothes ! Maybe you could wear your workout clothes at the gym and at home and wear these nice new ones I just spent a lot of money on for you cause your hot\" ( I assume your build is good since you say you go to the gym) and since she thinks your aesthetically pleasing wanted to enhance you with nicer clothes.  \n\nHow do you move on? She could buy you some new workout wear and you both agree on terms when you will them. Also you need to tell her you like that she did something thoughtful but you would of liked if she included you in the decision to give away what was yours. Ask her how she would feel if you did the same thing to her and talk about it . Then you both can understand each other and move on. ",

Like I have \"shitty graphic shirts\" that I LOVE and will never get rid of. I feel like doing that is controlling and you shouldn't try and change your SO that way.

My wife has done this to me to a much lesser extent a couple times before, I'd be looking for an old jacket or sweatshirt and then she'd just casually tell me she threw them away because they were in terrible shape. That always got my blood boiling. So eventually we had a fight over it and I told her that can't happen anymore. So instead of throwing my stuff away, she now just puts it next to the trash can and tells me \"hey can I throw that away?\".

The only reason I pick up my husbands clothes is because he's extremely busy, and clothes aren't his priority, but he has to wear nice clothes to work. I don't donate anything without his permission.

Your girlfriend should NOT have gotten rid of your old clothes, but on the flip side, you strike me as one of those people who will continue to wear clothes even when they're faded or have holes in them.  \n  \nMy dad is like this. He's never gotten rid of a single piece of clothing and will wear sweaters with holes to work or clothes that are way too big for him because his brother gave it to him. My dad is a great guy, but he just doesn't understand that it's not professional for a 60-something year old to work in a professional office environment with shoes that are falling apart. The only way my mom is able to get rid of these monstrosities is to clear them out when he's on vacation with his brothers.  \n  \nYour girlfriend way overstepped her boundaries, but I'd encourage you to step back and take a look at your dressing habits with a more objective eye. At the very least, you should not be wearing ratty clothes out in public settings. It's fine to dress comfortably, but there's a huge difference between wearing broken in jeans and a t-shirt in good condition and dressing like Frank from 30 Rock.",
            "This is SO violating. WHAT THE HELL.\n\nRun dude. Run now. This is really bad.",
            "Your girlfriend overstepped her boundaries and is WAY too pushy. I consider my husband a pushover and don't really care for the way he dresses/the old crap he keeps for way too long, but they're HIS things, not mine to donate/get rid of. The fact that she didn't just put all the stuff on the side for you to decide what to keep vs. what to throw out seems to portray a girlfriend who doesn't care about your input. ",
            ">Also I'm not going to break up with her over this, it sucks but not really break up worthy.\n\nWhy not?  Dude, this isn't about the clothes.  This is about the fact that she thinks she can do whatever she wants and has no regard for boundaries.  It doesn't matter if she threw away clothes or music or food, she threw away your personal belongings for no good reason.  Do you want kids? I would never want to raise a child with someone who has so little regard for personal property.  ",
            "Yeah I mean it's a little bit controlling, and she did go out of bounds a bit, but this shouldn't be a dealbreaker.  Just tell her that's not acceptable in the future, and go buy yourself some new, loose sweatpants etc.\n\nBTW, if you stay with this girl for a long time and/or get married, and if you're a reasonably open minded person, you will start to slowly gravitate toward her way of dressing -- I say this because it happened to me.  After a while you start to see the merit in it, and you start caring more about fashion.  It really is a healthier mindset to care about how you look and how you dress -- this is how you present yourself to the world, after all -- it's how people see you.  And the best thing about it is, that once you get interested in fashion, and you're buying fashionable clothes for yourself, you will look 10 times more kick ass than when someone else buys them for you.\n\nAll that said, she needs to let you \"grow up\" fashion-wise at your own pace.  It's like this, imagine you liked to eat junk food and she came home and threw away your McDonalds and cooked you a healthy and delicious meal.  It sucks that you wanted that guilty pleasure, true -- and she did overstep her bounds -- but ultimately she's right, you should eat healthier.",
            "I went through a similar struggle with a gf a while ago. She wanted me to dress better, I didn't want to lose my sense of style. \n\nI ended up making a look book of clothing styles and whatnot on Pinterest. If she wanted to buy me something it had to fit in with the scheme I created. Win win.\n\nWhen we broke up, and bunch of girls came at me becuase of my marked improvement and I never had to look like some Colombia/Nordstrom mannequin\n",
            "Are you sure she actually donated them? The fact that she managed to get back the one thing that you threw the biggest fit about is kind of strange...",
            "Your girlfriend is trying to change you and you're letting her. She's got your balls in her purse. Go take them back or get rid of her. She's got the upper hand in this relationship. It's not cool she donated your clothes. I don't care if you told her she can modify your closet that doesn't mean get rid of your personal belongings. I couldn't wear clothes that someone else picked out for me. It's a personal preference. Tell her you're going to dress how you want. You don't want to hear another word about the outfits you choose.  If she can't accept you for who you are then she should go find another guy she can tell how to dress.",
            "Girl here. I would be pissed. It would be one thing if it was a couple items that were trashed, but getting rid of everything? I have so many clothes that even though they don't look the best, they mean a lot to me because of where I got it, who I got it from, etc. Plus, you don't need to spend such a great amount on clothes that are just...plain ",
            ">I told her I wish she hadn't gotten rid of my old stuff and she said I would have kept wearing it so she had\n\nEveryone is saying it was a nice gesture in which she overstepped, but this makes me feel like she really is just trying to mold you into the model boyfriend who dresses like he's dating someone in the fashion industry. She had to or else you would have kept wearing it? This is about her needing you to look a certain way, far more than your comfort and preferences.  ",
            "Did she keep the receipts for all these new clothes she bought you? Did she leave the price tags or cut them off? I think this might make a difference, if she did keep these then it shows at least some awareness on her side that the clothes she bought you might not fit or be comfortable or look good on you after all. If you can return any of the clothes you feel don't work for you, do it and have a conversation with her about it.\n\nBut, my personal opinion is that this is a huge red flag. My own past relationship with someone manipulative & controlling (& later emotionally abusive) makes it hard for me to deal with behavior that might lead me down the same path. Maybe you guys would be able to work it out, maybe not, but are you willing to put in the effort to really try to work this out? Because I do think it would take a lot of effort to get the two of you on the same page. As for me no, I would gtfo, but it depends on what you're comfortable with.",
            "How thick can she be to not realise that she really, really, REALLY overstepped some large boundaries here. I would be so angry. I can see her point of view but those were your things- why does she feel entitled to just go through your old posessions and give them away? this is crazy. To me this speaks of a giant lack of respect and an overreaching entitlement to you and whatever you own. To this day i still ask if i can borrow my boyfriends sweat pants to wear home, its been 5 years and i still ask, because its polite, and im not entitled. Those are his things, and i certainly would never dream of bundling up his ''junk'' and sending it to the salvos because you just never know what article of clothing/hunk of junk means the moon to him. \n\nThis reminds me of a story of a girlfriend who took her boyfriends grandfather's watch and had it ingraved with her and bf, love forever or something. And she just couldnt understand why the boyfriend was so upset about it. ",
            "This is so messed up. I would be soooooooo angry. How dare she, really? She doesn't know what some of those items could possibly mean. I have t-shirts & stuff from friends and relatives who have passed away. I'd be livid if someone just tossed them! LIVID. \n\nIt's fine if she wants to buy you new stuff, but she should NOT have gotten rid of ANYTHING without your okay. ",
            "Any pictures of your old clothes and your new clothes? Just curious.",
            "I agree you have a right to be pissed off and that she should be remorseful. Not necessarily for buying you clothes, but because she got rid of all your old stuff, which is serious boundary crossing. I've been married 27 years and I wouldn't do that to my husband.\n\nMaybe she could understand your reaction better if you tried to get her to imagine how she would feel if you asked if you could buy her some sexy lingerie, and she said yes, and then when she was gone some weekend you threw out all her bras and panties and replaced them with corsets and thongs. ",
            "Did you explain to your girlfriend how you're a guy and fashion is about comfort, not about wearing an ascot? \n\nWhat are you going to do? You can't get your clothes back. Bite the bullet, replace the things that are super important (i'm guessing tennis shoes, shorts, t-shirts, etc), and figure out what the perfect revenge is. She deserves it. That's the best I got. Good luck.",
            "It's a test OP. Just the first step of seeing what crosses the boundary and you showed your mark. Good work. ",
            "I'd say it's grounds for breaking up. If she didn't like your clothes at the start, then why get with you? That's some bullshit",
            "As other commenters said, this seems like she did it for her and not for you and it's an insanely manipulative move in her own interest. The only thing I might wonder is if you had expressed an interest in dressing nicer. Then, maybe, she thought she was also doing (manipulating you) something for you (also).",
            "Complete lack of respect and boundaries there. This would be a pretty big deal if it happened to me. ",
            "Dude, straight up bitch. A) Your clothes are a personal collection of things YOU find appealing. B) She did this because she wants to change you. Not cool",

            "Red flag\nCouples counseling \nGet a lawyer. \n\nJust kidding. As you say not worth breaking up over. Right intentions (a smart dressed man) wrong execution throwing away your property. \n\nIf a lesson has been learnt about boundaries you can move on better than before. \n\nClothing is a consumable it doesn't last for ever, you probably don't want it too unless you are all about the function. In that case I wonder if you have a future with a girl who has an interest in form. ",
            "> I told her I wish she hadn't gotten rid of my old stuff and she said I would have kept wearing it so she had to\n\nGirlfriend, I really appreciate and am excited about this generous gift you've given me.  It makes it possible for me to dress nicely on occasions where that would be prudent, and the items you picked out are incredibly nice and just my style.  You did a great job.  The reason I am upset is because I feel you stepped over the line when you purposely got rid of my things so I wasn't able to wear them again; I feel like that is manipulative and controlling, and I don't appreciate it.  While I'm excited to wear my new clothes out to dinner/whatever, I want to be comfortable at home.  I would appreciate you helping me select some new comfortable items I can bum around in, that perhaps aren't as bummy as my last set. In either case,  I want to be sure that from this point forward in our relationship that neither of us feels like our boundaries are crossed.\n\n---\n\nI'd be pissed, too.",
            "Re your update, I'd be happier if she understood she did something wrong and promised not to throw out your stuff without your consent in future....but otherwise ok. Is there any understanding on her part yet or still crickets?",
            "I would tell her you appreciate the gesture, but just disappointed to lose some of your belongings, and give her an example of something you or others may dislike that she enjoys that she would be sad to lose. Perhaps come up with a compromise, in that you'll wear the clothes but can have a few Key wardrobe pieces of your choosing, for example, some more comfortable sweat pants?",
            "If I come home tomorrow and my wife has thrown my boots out...so help me Lord my daughter and I will be on the next train to Timbuktu. Even assuming I could forgive her on a personal level--and that's a big if--such a person clearly lacks the stable judgment required for child rearing and other domestic endeavors.",
            "Lacking a penis, it's very difficult for women to mark their territory in the traditional way. So instead, they give you a makeover. This was more extreme than usual, but the message is the same: she considers you to be her property.",
            "Why is she even mad at you when she's the one who decided to replace all your things without your consent? Although it's fine to let her buy you some if she wants to  but that doesn't mean she can toss your things. I find it absolute rude and if my bf does that to me, I would be freaking mad, esp those tees I bought at conventions and stuff. She has to realize that boundaries still applies even when you are living together. You're not a dick at all. Those are all your things that you worked for, you have the right to be mad.\n\nIt's not as far as dunping her but you should make her realize that it's not right.",
            "\"I gave it away so you couldn't wear what you wanted to wear.\"\n\nThat right there is just wrong.",
            "She sounds well intentioned, just went about it the wrong way. \n\nThe way she thought about it i bet was \"He will be happy that he looks better\" \n\nDefinitely have a conversation about boundaries, but before you break up or do something to really hurt her feelings maybe really take a good look in the proverbial mirror about how you used to dress and how other people perceived you because of how you dressed. \n\nI used to dress like a slob too and it took some serious self evaluation. My present self is quite disgusted with my past self\n\nI dont think it's unreasonable for her to want you to look your best. Compromise wouldve been a better route though. Something like \"wear what you want when we are home, but I would like it if you could dress nicer when we go out\" ",
            "Glad you're not breaking up over it, but you're not a dick to be pissed off.\n\nYes, you gave her some approval to help with your wardrobe, and she thought maybe you are too lazy or uninterested in shopping for yourself and she loves fashion... Was glad to do it...\n\nBUT - she could've put your old stuff in storage bins and gave you an opportunity to sort through and see what you would wanna keep or donate.  That was definitely crossing the line for her to just get rid of all of it. ",
