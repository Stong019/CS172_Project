        "selftext": "[Here is the original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/kfhw2j/i_24m_cannot_stand_my_boyfriends_roommates_26f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nMy first post didn\u2019t get the most attention, but there was been a major recent event that made me think it was time to post an update. \n\nHis roommate went away for the weekend (Valentine\u2019s Day weekend!) and it fell on us to take care of the dog. I, obviously, was not too excited to be having to schedule my Valentine\u2019s Day weekend around this dog\u2019s needs, but was willing to do so to have a weekend alone with my boyfriend.\n\nWell, much to my surprise, the dog is a total sweetheart! When her owner is not around, she barely raises her voice, sleeps most of the day, and is extremely easy to care for! It would appear that it is really stuff like the incessant baby talking that *actually* bothers me, not the dog itself.\n\nThrough observation, as well, I\u2019ve realized that the dog only barks and whines because she knows she\u2019ll get attention or food *from her owner* whenever she wants. My boyfriend has very cleverly trained the dog to know that that doesn\u2019t work on anyone else. So no begging from us!\n\nSo now I ignore the roommate\u2019s dealings with the dog, love the dog herself, and let my boyfriend\u2019s roommate deal with the worst parts of owning an old dog and just enjoy a buddy to watch tv with when shes not around.\n\nWin win! Thank you everyone for all the great advice.\n\nTL/DR: Dog doesn\u2019t suck! Roommate still sucks at raising the dog but its much easier to ignore now because the dog is so great!",

            "That's a great update OP, thanks! Glad you made a new friend!",
            "Lol I love this post cause it pretty much explains all problems with dogs it\u2019s mostly the owner and not the dog itself",
            "I can relate. I'm a huge dog person, never met a dog I didn't instantly melt over. Except my roommate's dog who is actually really cute but it's 100% the way she fails at taking care of it and having to deal with her yelling at the dog or then super, almost over-coddling it 10 seconds later that has made me grown resentful about having a dog in the house. But when she's not there and I walk past his crate, he's a sweet boy. It's just my roommate's \"training\" that I'm resentful over.",
            "FWIW, Kids operate pretty much the same way.  My nieces and nephew were/are all nightmares of whining, crying, begging and arguing around their parents, yet perfectly pleasant little people when they are alone with me because they know those behaviors don't do them any good.",
            "I can totally relate to this post. My best friend moved back into her family home after finishing her degree down in the USA (we're from Canada!). I absolutely adore dogs but never had the pleasure of owning my own. For some odd reason, I couldn't stand it when her family dog is active around the house. Their pitbull jumps up and would claw up my arms and legs because he's just too excited to have people around. This doesn't just happen when people arrive, but the entire time guests visit. He will get on the coffee table and knock over drinks.  You can't leave food unattended on the kitchen counter. If you leave your bag hanging on the coat hook or chair, he will take off with it. He loves to steal shoes and hide them in his bed. He will beg, whine and vocalize his frustration. It got to the point where I asked if the dog could stay in his crate while I visited.\n\nHis behavior didn't change until her parents went away on vacation. It was like night and day. He was so well-behaved; no begging, no whining, and no jumping. He would listen to commands. My best friend was the main caregiver to this dog until she left for University, then the dog became a family dog. Her parents lapsed in his training and let him get away with everything while she was away. All those manners snapped back once he realized she held the keys to his food, toys, and walks.\n\nLike someone else mentioned. There are not problem dogs, just bad owners.",
            "I didn\u2019t see the original post, but from reading it just now, I definitely got the impression that it wasn\u2019t a *dog* problem, but an owner problem. Some pet owners can be insufferable when it comes to their pets.",
            "Ive always said that its not dogs barking that bothers me in a neighborhood, but the owners that yell at them to stop barking.\n\n'Bella!  Bella , stop! Bella!  Bella COME HERE .  HERE NOW!  BELLA COME!\n\n\nget a fucking leash or dog run.   (They finally did. Small miracles)",
            "I've never met a dog I didn't \"like\" but I've certainly met plenty of people who rubbed me the wrong way.",
            "The roommate isn't \"raising\" the dog. It's an elder rescue.",
            "Pets are merely a reflection of the boundaries we do and do not have.",
            "One of my daughters baby talks to our pets and it makes me want put my head through a wall. It\u2019s so irritating!",
            "It also could be the dog settling in, dogs that are passed around can take months to adjust to their new surroundings and act overly emotional at first.",
            "Just read your original post and thought she has an human issue not a dog issue! She'd drive me insane too.",
            "Your original post didn't get the most attention? You literally got dozens of helpful comments, advice and even one person telling you you have no idea what the dog must have gone through in its 12 years.",
            "LOL glad you and the dog are talking again, i really shipped you two",
            "My boyfriends mom treats her BIG ASS dog like a baby, even went so far as to say \u201cshe really little in her mind\u201d & since getting her dog, it\u2019s been hell going to her house! She also does the baby talk, not only to her dog but to my 12 (13 in 2 months) old daughter too. We all hate it.",
            "im in a similar situation. i freaking hate my boy friends dog. i dont really know why either. it is a tiny dog. it probably weighs about 4lbs. i hate him so much though. he lets him climb on the dinign room table when we are eating. he lets him chew up his nice furniture. he pees and poops everywhere. he is useless. he doesnt follow any commands. he is home all day for 9plus hours alone. i kind of feel sorry for him but its my boy friends fault.",
            "Just wanted to chip in and say, if the roommate is talking to the dog in a high pitched (baby)voice consistently, the dog likely perceives it as whining in \u201cdog speak\u201d, and perceives it as how they communicate. \nI have no helpful advice, but thought this might be a helpful piece of info.",
            "Wow. You found out your answer quite smoothly. If the problem was the roommate, speak with the roommate about the dog.",
            "The owners energy has a lot to do with how the dog reacts. Dogs really pick up on when a person is unsure in what they say or anxious, and will mirror that energy. Maybe observe how the roommate comes off or watch some dog whisperer so you can say you were watching and was wondering how they feel when giving commands or when the dog is passing other dogs/strangers.",
            "That dog have their owner wrapped around its finger, wth\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nReminds me of a story i got told by a dog training instructor i know. She had this small dog who couldn't sit, so she caved a bit and gave it a treat for just initiating sitting. Then one time her granddaughter (5 or so at the time) came and told the dog to sit and it sat down perfectly and my friend was so baffled and asked her granddaughter how she did that\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
            "Glad you realized it's the roomate who's the problem and not an innocent dog.",
            "I\u2019m not surprised after reading the other thread. Who the hell just leaves a puddle of dog pee sitting there to sip a latte? And then makes their roommate clean it up after a guest steps in it? I seriously question wether that roommate is responsible enough to care for a senior dog, but that\u2019s neither here nor there given your place in the situation.",
            "Baby talk to animals is so annoying. They aren\u2019t babies! You\u2019re just making weird noises and it is so grating!",
            "I think you are sick of sharing your place with the roommate.\nProjecting onto the dog.\nMaybe there\u2019s more tension in the house when you\u2019re all there",
            "Glad you finally learned that the dogs issues come from the owner and not the dog itself. It\u2019s great things are better for you now.",
            "Why did the roommate leave for the weekend? Did it just happen to be Valentines weekend or was is Valentines related?  I hope your boyfriend got paid/compensation even if it turns out to be a good dog.  This isn't about the dog, it's about the owner and being accountable.  Unlike in your original post where she watched your boyfriend clean the dog's pee because she had to drink her latte before it got cold.\n\nThere has to be a premium, especially when it's Valentine's and taking care of a someone else's responsibility interferes with plans/limits freedoms.  I was asked to cat sit for during Valentine's weekend.  I would not budge of $80/night, they thought it was expensive but I would have had to be responsible for the cat during my own valentine's plans.  I could only think the owner's had valentine's plans out of town.  I think they wanted quality and peace of mind at a low cost.",
            "My dog was nearly perfectly behaved (GSD) when I moved in with a roommate. Now not so much. Can't wait until I find a new place. It sucks how living with a person who has bad behavior can make a good dog terrible.",
            "I actually had a very similar experience with my mother in law\u2019s dog. When I spend time with him one-on-one, his behavior improves dramatically. Glad you figured it out OP :)",
            "She might not have trained the dog in a good manner.",
            "Aw, dogs are rarely the problem it's humans that enable bad behaviors and then wonder why they've lost respect and control.  \nI'm glad you two became friends <3",
            "I went back to read your first post before reading the update and I didn\u2019t get halfway through before I thought \u201csounds like the roommate is the problem, not the dog\u201d. Glad it worked out",
            "Thanks for the update,  im happy for you !",
            "Now you\u2019ll know next time that it\u2019s likely the owner that\u2019s allowing bad behavior rather than the dog itself. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t naughty doggos too, but I\u2019m glad you realized how great the dog is!",
            "I've had my dogs for ten years. I am the only person they wont bother for food because I am the only person who has never given in to them. I can sit right next to someone else on the couch with a plate of food in my lap and they don't even look my way because they know it ain't happening. Dogs are smart. \n\nI'm glad you and the dog have both found a new bud!",
            "I did not grow up around dogs, for a long time I thought I didn\u2019t like them. Any experience I had with a dog was not a pleasant one.\n\nThen one day, I became good friends with someone who had the *best* dog, RIP Albi. The sweetest angle. He was so sweet and gentle and such a good listener. I had no idea dogs what dogs could be like. Since then, I have met plenty of other great pups. It has also helped me look at the pups that get out of hand in a different light. It\u2019s not their fault.\n\nIt really is all about the owners.",
            "Yup dogs do train their owners. This is the perfect example of that. Some dogs are just too smart.",
            "Head on over to r/DogCultureFree.",
            "What a great update! Her owner sounds exhausting tbh, constantly fishing for compliments. Being demanded to agree that she's just *so cute* with no let up? Even if she is cute, anyone would start resenting the constant demand for validation. No wonder your irritation started extending towards the dog, and I'm glad you figured out it's not the dog at all.",
            "Great example of bad owner not bad dog. \u2764\ufe0f",
            "I was reading the original post and instantly got that the roommate sucks at raising and handling the dog, nothing wrong with the dog itself. Many of the comments were so blatantly off and unnecessarily mean that I think most of them were terrible dog owners themselves lol.\n\nVery happy about this update, OP! Love that you're loving the pup.",
            "Aww \ud83e\udd72 so glad to see a positive update, doesn't happen too often here & glad you've got yourself a new TV buddy, yay.\n\nCan't say I'm not a bit envious, I wanna dog sooo bad \ud83d\ude2d if anyone knows of the quietest breed ever we may be able to keep it a secret from landlords",
            "Lol I read the original and I already knew it was the roommate that was the problem. She sounds terrible. Good luck with her.",
            "I hear ya! Most newborns are like this. You are not alone. 4 hour stretches overnight at this stage is pretty great! Daytime naps are a struggle usually. It\u2019ll get better!",
            "I read your previous post and I kept thinking \u201cthat\u2019s not the dog it\u2019s the owner\u201d I\u2019m really glad to see this update. I was a dog sitter in college and a lot of my \u201cproblem\u201d dogs were only a problem for their owner.",
            "Love dogs, but I can't stand dogs that bark or whine or badger me or others during a meal. It's really bad behaviour and I have absolutely no idea why people like this behaviour or encourage it. My in laws have dogs who behave like this, I tolerate it in their home but really wish it didn't occur.",
            "The human is always the problem",
            "stop in the middle of conversations if the dog simply ADJUSTS its position when sitting to say \u201cawww look isn\u2019t she so cute?!\u201d I can only confirm that the dog is cute so many time in a one hour period before going insane. It\u2019s a constant stream of \u201cawww [dog\u2019s name] is so cute I love her awwwww.\u201d\n\n\nmy BFF and I do this abt our own dog all the time but it's ok because  we are both equally gaga over the dog.\n\nwe both know that each other is the only other person who will never get tired of hearing how awesome the dog is :)",
            "There is a saying there are no bad dogs, only bad dog owners.",
            "I'm glad you got it figured out OP. Reading the responses on your last post though was crazy. It's amazing to me how much bad dog behavior people don't think is an issue. Like a ton of the responses were that you should be happy that the dog got a loving home regardless of its behaviors. Um, what? I love dogs, however I do not like untrained wild dogs. We have a friend who has a husky and every time we come over it jumps all over me, raking it's nails down my arms, backs or legs. It mouths on me constantly and it can't be out away because it will cry and bark the whole time if she's seperated from us. It's not like this is a puppy either, it's just never been taught to not jump, or behave. Another family has a small dog but the family let's thr dog lick their feet constantly, so every time I go over, this dog tries to lick my feet and it's so fucking disgusting, I hate it so much.",

Sorry for not responding in that thread, real life's been a whirlwind lately, yay someone at the office testing positive for covid.\n\nLong story short, I did as redditors suggested and did a zoom call with my big sister, ostensibly to catch up but really to get a handle on how things have changed.\n\nMy sister was actually really great and supportive about my lifestyle changes. She apologized immediately for the 'jokes' when she saw how much weight I'd lost and was super supportive about me not drinking anymore and coming out of the closet.

My big sister, the one who's having the wedding, has always been my mom's favorite, but she says that she's opened her eyes to how my mom treats people and is planning to move away herself after the wedding (our parents are paying for most of it).\n\nI've agreed with my sister that I'm not coming to the wedding. We agreed that it would give mom a new target to make a huge scene over, and there will be an open bar at the wedding when I don't trust myself to be around that kind of thing. \n\nWe're now planning for my sister and husband to come visit me in my new city sometime after the wedding. \n\nThank you for all the advice and support!\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: zoom called big sister, she's great, I'm not going to the wedding but my sister will visit later",

        "selftext": "One of my work colleagues is a lifelong friend of mine. We lived on the same street growing up, went to the same school and when I needed a job after graduating university, she made me aware of an opening at the company she worked at. I applied, got the job, and it's been quite a few years since and we still work together.\n\nIt's a pretty small company, and quite male-dominated, so after we started working together we became really close. We take all our lunches together, we regularly stop by each other's desks for a chat, and we quickly became known round the office as inseparable.\n\nA year ago she got engaged to her long term partner, and I was ecstatic for her. She had a really tough time a couple of years ago (two family deaths close together) and I did everything I could to be a good friend to her while she was in the worst stages of grieving. She cried with me daily for weeks and I made sure she knew I was always available to listen. I also took about a third of her workload off her voluntarily, so she could take days off when she needed to without stressing about her work building up. So now that life has gotten better for her and she's always smiling and excited, it's really nice to see.\n\nEver since she got engaged, as expected, she's talked a lot about wedding plans, especially at our lunches. I know basically every detail. When she booked her venue she was really excited, but she refused to tell me where it was going to be, saying that she wanted it to be a surprise when the invitations came out.\n\nThe wedding is two weeks away now, and I've long since stopped waiting for my invitation to show up. I know when they were sent because she told me all about delivering them, and shows me every day the gifts people have started to buy off their registry.\n\nI feel silly for saying it, but the more I think about it, the more hurt I feel that I haven't been included. It's a big wedding, and she has invited some other people from work that I didn't know she was even close to. She hasn't mentioned the reason why I'm not invited, and at this point I feel too awkward to ask. I guess it's just a slap in the face because I really thought we were close, and now I'm realising that maybe we're not.\n\nThe trouble is, since all this I've started to really examine our friendship, and I'm wondering if she even cares about me at all. I can think of a hundred examples of where I've helped her work through decisions, listen to her vent, stood up for her when she's had issues with colleagues etc. Even tons of little things, like if anyone brings in cake and she's out of the office I always save her a slice so she doesn't miss out. But I can't remember a time that she did anything for me in return.\n\nNow when she talks to me, I've realised she doesn't even listen to me. When I'm finished talking she just carries on with what she was saying before, almost as if I'd never spoken at all. If we're ever talking about me or something I've been doing, she never has anything to say. She just kind of nods and then switches the conversation back to herself.\n\nI'm starting to think she couldn't care less about me, she just likes having someone around who she can talk at, and whoever that person is doesn't really matter to her.\n\nI've invested so many years into this friendship, it's really cut me deep. I feel used. It's also made being at work incredibly lonely, because she was my only friend.\n\nI've stopped having lunch with her and any time she tries to chat I politely bring the conversation to a quick end and go back to work. She doesn't appear to have even noticed.\n\nI do still wish her well, I'm still glad for her that life has turned around and she's so happy, but I'm a bit lost. I'm not sure if I'm being too harsh because I'm hurt, or if I even have the right to feel hurt in the first place, as I know weddings have a finite number of guests and you have to leave people out that you would invite in an ideal world.\n\nBut I'm not sure there's any way back from this either. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Am I being unreasonable or overdramatic? Should I just let the dust settle and see how I feel then?\n\nEdit 1: Just to clarify things that have been asked a lot or requested to be put in an edit - 1) She hand delivered the invites to other people at work so I know it hasn't been lost in the post 2) I haven't asked her about it because I'm a total doormat and scared of difficult conversations and 3) I invited her to my wedding, but that was years ago so it's possible she thinks things have changed since then.\n\nEdit 2: This has got a lot more attention than I expected, and my first ever gold from a kind stranger, thank you!\n\nI have read every single comment, thank you all so much for taking the time to give me advice. You have given me A LOT to think about.\n\nOpinion seems to be divided over whether or not I should confront the wedding invitation issue or just let it go. I am definitely going to make sure that it isn't a mistake, but as for getting an explanation why she didn't invite me I'm undecided. I'm going to have a think about that and the best way to proceed, but your thoughts have all been really helpful.\n\nIn terms of our friendship in general, I'm not going to be too hasty to write it off. I'm going to try and put my feelings aside and see if I'm right about it being one-sided. If it is then I will have learned a good life lesson, and if I see it as worth saving then I'll have to deal with that the best way I can.\n\nIt does seem the bigger issue here is my non-confrontational approach to my relationships. Some of your comments were hard to read but only because I know you're right and this is something I have to change. I've withdrawn from friendships before because they've hurt me and I've felt unable to say anything, and that's not really fair.\n\nIt's a general problem I have with uncomfortable conversations. Whenever I have to have them I basically descend into a panic, my mouth goes dry, I shake and I can't find the right words to say. If it's a bad enough problem that I can't ask a good friend a simple question then I can't ignore it any more and I need to work on this. Thank you for pointing this out to me as a real problem, I'm going to find a way to get better at it.\n\nI will post an update of what happens, thank you again!\n\nTL;DR My best work friend didn't invite me to her wedding, and since then I've started to question our entire friendship. I think it's permanently damaged everything we had, and I'm feeling really hurt, lost, and unsure of how to proceed.",

            "Why don\u2019t you ask her why you didn\u2019t get an invite? If you thought of her as one of your close friends, seems like it would be worth the effort.",
            "I think the people who have suggested talking to her about the invite have the right idea, but because of the other issues you mentioned (mainly the seeming lack of reciprocity and care), I wanted to mention something additional.\n\nI have no idea if this is what is happening with this person, but something I've slowly come to realize over the past few years is that - due to my nature - some people come to see me as a kind of Attention and Care Utility. Like just open the tap and you'll get a pretty good listener, and someone who can be counted on to really try to be helpful and empathetic.\n\nBecause I am so reliably this, and because I do this right off the bat, regardless of how  \\*I'm\\* treated, two things often happen:\n\n1. a certain type of person realizes that this is a service I provide that they don't have to do anything more than activate. Consciously or un-, they realize I do this \\*regardless of what I'm given\\* so they realize they don't have to use energy to be reciprocal with me.\n2. I do this automatically and without ever evaluating if the other person has earned this level of attention and care.\n\nNow, part of why I did this is because who wants relationships to be transactional?? And if I am a generous person, doesn't it require me to live my own values regardless of what I'm given?\n\nWell, I've started to realize that there has to be some middle ground. It doesn't have to be transactional, and I am going to continue to be a generous person who wants to provide a lot of deep attention and care...but  I need to make sure I'm not burning up that energy on people who can't help me renew it by returning some attention and care back to me.\n\nOk that's a lot about me, I'm sorry, but I just see in your description of what you've now realized if this might be a mechanism at work with this person and in your life. And if so, I've realized a by-product of this dynamic is that this kind of person, in addition to not feeling a need to reciprocate, per the above, also never feels the need to, for lack of a better word, do anything to earn my friendship.\n\nSo I could see this kind of person seeing their invitations as currency to spend to increase intimacy or impress someone they want to cultivate a relationship with but since you're already on board with providing hot and cold running care and attention, she doesn't need to \"spend\" an invitation on you.\n\nSomething I've had to do with some of these relationships is just re-frame them. I need to not think of this person as someone who can give me the kind of empathetic warmth and concern I might like, but they might be fun! They might be interesting, or they  might help the work day go by faster. But I no longer expect them to meet certain emotional needs, and I also, frankly, have put a bit of a limit on the hot and cold running care I was providing. Not punitively, but as self-protection. (And usually they don't seem to even notice! So I was wringing myself out for...what, exactly?!)\n\nAnyway, I hope I haven't gone too far afield of your original issue, just some things that the additional details really made me think of in my own life.",
            "I had a similar situation (sort of). I was best friends with a guy since we were 13. He had some success in his life and we remained very close. He ended up dating a woman who was/is pretty famous. A short time after he started dating her, I found out from my mother's friend (who didn't know that I didn't know) that they were engaged. She had heard about it on the news or from some website. I looked it up on my phone and found out they had been engaged for two weeks. I still sucked it up and congratulated him. I was very upset, but kept it to myself because I didn't want to ruin the happy time for him. He talked to me about the wedding and how it was going to be very small, in her home state. Only immediate family. I joked I was disappointed that I wouldn't get to see him get married (years earlier he had told me I would be a \"groomsman\" when/if he ever did), but that I understood why they would want to keep it small. Months later, they get married. I see pictures on different websites and his sister and mothers FB pages. There were well over 100 people present at that wedding. Standing up next to him was his college roommate (obviously not an immediate family member) and my heart broke. Then, it hit me: our friendship had been one-sided for years and I didn't even notice or cared to notice. When it was his birthday, I would call and wish him a happy birthday. On my birthday, I wouldn't hear from him or I would hear but he would make no mention that it was my birthday. Not finding out about his engagement and not being invited to his wedding opened my eyes. After that, I stopped making an effort and he seemed to notice and stopped making one in return. About 2.5 years ago, he emailed me saying he didn't know where the friendship went but would I help him with a new TV project he was working on. I used the excuse that I was too pregnant (I was) to give it 100% of my time. He didn't congratulate me or anything. That sealed the deal for me. \n\nMy advice to you is to ask your friend whats up. My guess is that this friendship is one sided like mine was, but either way, you'll have some  closure to the friendship. Don't wait years to get that closure because it will eat away at you.",
            "\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s been on my mind and I\u2019ve just got to ask: You\u2019ve delivered all of your wedding invitations and I didn\u2019t get one and why is that?\u201d",
            "have you asked her? An invitation could have gotten lost in the mail.",
            "I'm confused why, if you see and talk to her every single day, you didn't mention when you never received an invitation?",
            "this has happened to me so many times in all types of relationships at all stages in life. I\u2019ve honestly accepted that the few people that care are really the only ones. i\u2019m kind and people use that, i wont change myself to be accepted by someone else. it is not wrong for you to feel bad that you were not invited, but you should never ever regret being a good person.",
            "I just want to address you feeling lonely at work now. Instead of spending all of your time with one colleague resulting in a work bff, its better to have a bunch of colleagues you can consider your friend. I know it might seem too late to do that in your current office, but hey, you've still got a long career ahead!\n\nAfter personally being in a similar relationship dynamic for years, I realised that it's always better to spread your source of energy, time and happiness, and not depend on one person/thing in any walk of life. People change, values change. You're more safeguarded this way.",
            "So clearly she hadn\u2019t invited you and there\u2019s no missing invite as she hand delivered to other people at work. So at this point I don\u2019t think I\u2019d bother asking. It\u2019s pretty clear that she\u2019s using you as an ear to yack at over lunch but she doesn\u2019t see much actual friendship between the two of you. So if I were you I\u2019d just continue doing the fade.\n\nIt\u2019s super tacky to talk endlessly about your wedding to someone you\u2019re not inviting.",
            "Youre doing great already with the fade.  \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97",
            "You should ask her why you didn't get an invite. You've been friends for years, she's gone on and on about her wedding plans to you.",
            ">I think it's permanently damaged everything we had\n\nUnless there's been a massive, MASSIVE misunderstanding here. Like, she had a blank and thought she'd given you your invitation and received your RSVP already (highly unlikely since the wedding is only two weeks away, but I guess stranger things have happened), I actually think this has helped you open your eyes to how little you've gained from the friendship and how selfish this person is. I would go so far as to say there wasn't much there to damage in the first place, apart from, sadly, your own belief that this was a reciprocal friendship.\n\nIt sounds like while you're good enough as an emotional crutch when she needs you, you're not *quite* up there enough to attend her wedding when she doesn't. You may well have made the list at some point, but got bumped off as other people were thought of and yeah... I would be extremely hurt too in your shoes; she's being incredibly thoughtless and selfish right now. \n\nIf I were you, since you're beginning to realise how one-sided this friendship has been, I'd continue to pull away and make yourself less available to her. It's obvious to me that you were deliberately not invited, so I don't see much point in you bringing it up off your own bat. If she asks you if everything's ok (either before or after the day), you can then matter-of-factly tell her that not being invited to her wedding hurt you, but don't go much further than that. If she tries to justify herself, tell her it's fine but you'd rather just be left to carry on with your work.\n\nI wouldn't count on this happening, though. She sounds way too selfish to worry about anyone or anything other than herself and her wedding, and I wouldn't be surprised if you just kind of mutually faded out of each other's lives after this.",
            "You have to ask her if you are invited. If she says no then you will know exactly where you stand and can move on with your life. If she says yes then you can save yourself the heartache.",
            "OP you sound like a lovely friend, that any person would be lucky to have in their lives.\n\nHowever, I worry that you are judging your (ex?)-friend too soon. It sounds really strange if she would go on and on about her wedding, if she didn't intend to invite you. And her venue would only be \"a surprise\" if you would be there to witness it, no?\n\nWhat if the invitation got lost in the mail, or somehow got missed on their invitation list (you said it was a large wedding)? What if she's simply being a bit absentminded and in the clouds, not realising your silence or distance the right way (I can sometimes be obtuse without intending to be, I'm just a little absentminded and daydreamy by nature)?\n\nA more sinister option is some weird jealousy or opposition from the fianc\u00e9's side, but even that could possibly have nothing to do with your friendship.\n\nPlease, talk to her. Don't let what could be just a misunderstanding ruin what you yoruself define as your closest friendship.\n\nBest of luck - please keep us updated!",
            "[deleted]",
            "Are you guys so close that in her mind there wouldn\u2019t even be a question about you being a part of her wedding, that it\u2019s simply a given?",
            "A couple of interpretations jump out to me:\n\n1) She is uncomfortable with a person who reminds her of a time in her life when she was vulnerable.\n\n2) She is detaching in preparation for moving on.\n\nAdult friendship is tricky and in my experience much more transient than school or uni friendships. The truth is other relationships tend to take priority as we get older.",
            "She told you about her wedding plans, hand delivered the invitations to coworkers, and even after not inviting you she still has the audacity to talk about her wedding? Wow she\u2019s bold! Hopefully there\u2019s some mistake but I would for sure say something about it.",
            "If the friendship is already floundering, why not go ahead and put it out of its misery. Flat out ask, \u201cI\u2019m sorry and a little embarrassed to bring it up, but may I ask why I was not invited to the wedding? It\u2019s fine, I just wondered why?\u201d \n\nThat way you will know that it wasn\u2019t an oversight of some sort, and she won\u2019t have an excuse later",
            "I'm sorry you're going through this.\n\nI've felt the same way in the past where I've been the giver and others have been the takers. But you don't realize it until years down the line. I can tell you from experience that something like this changes you. It changes the way you form and continue the various types of relationships that enter your life. You become more cautious of giving--but only because you want to receive, too. It's healthy, and it's what you deserve.\n\nWould you be willing to update with us?",
            "I forgot to invite my best friend to my 21st. She obviously came because she knew all the details etc, and I was horrified when she slipped out that she hadn't recieved an invitation. Hopefully it is the same situation.",
            "Simply ask her OP. Say that you care about her and would have been honored to have been invited, but we\u2019re curious why you weren\u2019t invited and if she even saw you as a friend. \n\nWorst case scenario, you learn that she truly doesn\u2019t value your friendship and you move on. Best case scenario she says, \u201choly shit, did you not get an invite???\u201d  Sounds like a win win.",
            "Simply put she needs you at work as her buddy and that's about it.\n\nOutside of work she's covered by others & deep down she knows she doesn't have to \"work\"to have a relationship with you. Hence the invites I guess.\n\nSorry I disagree with everyone suggesting speaking to her. The woman is a fully grown adult & she is very much aware that you didnt get an invite --by your own words she refused to say where the venue would be at- till the invites went out-- this right here is telling. Even if you did say something, she'll what? I don't see her being honest about it & might even try to minimalize what she's done to make you feel silly \n\nIt sucks- a lot. You sound like me with several other people in my life. Frankly I try to stop doing the whole \"treat others as you would want to be treated\" because nobody every treats you that way...but I have a hard time NOT doing it & then I end up hating myself for it.\n\nGood luck!",
            "So I came here because I thought I was going to read about someone being unreasonable about not being invited to a wedding. But after reading, I'm 100% on your side. This person sounds rude and self-involved and like a terrible friend. If I didn't invite someone at work that I hung out with all the time, I would definitely NOT discuss my wedding plans with them. Especially since she invited other people at work? She should be talking to them about it then. The fact that she hasn't even asked why you've started to pull away or even noticed? Ugh. Remove your emotions from this relationship immediately. This person doesn't give a crap about you and you deserve real friends.",
            "I'm a quiet guy. I was new at a job a long time ago, really tight knit group. Our supervisor was getting married one year after I started working there, really big wedding in the best hotel in the city. Noone every approached me or invited me, and I didn't go - I thought I was a new guy, so didn't hold it against him at all. He told me after the wedding weekend he didn't see me at the wedding - and after I told him noone invited me, just went \"oh... You should've come.\" Just ask her, it obviously means a lot to you.",
            "I'm so sorry that she did this to you after making It seem like you were a valued friend. Unfortunately, the fact that she doesn't reciprocate your compassion and listening skills tells me that you are only setting yourself up for more hurt by bringing up your feelings about not being invited. The best thing for you would be to completely end the \"friendship\" and only speak about work matters. No more lunches, no more letting her confide in you and no more letting yourself be used by her emotionally. \n\nIF she brings up you being distant then, and only then, should you say something like \"While I considered us friends after all this time of being there for you, I realized, after you not inviting me to your wedding and not offering a reason why, that I no longer wish to be in a one-sided friendship. I hope you can respect that and limit your interactions with me to work related conversations. I'm sorry and I do wish you all the best.\" Otherwise you will continue to be disappointed and now that you've seen her and everything for what it is, continuing on the way you were would be foolish.\n\n I'm really sorry and everyday am let down by humans who can treat other humans like this. You seem like a wonderful and thoughtful friend! Surround yourself with people like yourself. Good luck with how ever you choose to end this, but please end it and firmly. \ud83d\udc9c\n\nETA - To everyone saying she should be asking her why she wasn't invited, I say this -\n\nThe time to do it is gone. She knows OP knows she isn't invited and SHE should be telling her why, OP shouldn't be asking. Its just the nail in the \"end this friendship\" coffin. The answer is, is that this girl is emotionally manipulative and a user. She didn't value OPs friendship in the same way OP did. If it were me, I wouldn't give her the satisfaction of letting her know I cared about not getting invited. She likes having the upper hand and enjoys how she manipulates people. Seriously, If she valued OP and their friendship she would have told OP why she couldn't invite her BEFORE she handed out the invites to their other co-workers. Since she didn't want to be mature, sorry but fuck her. That's so petty and rude.",
            "> I've invested so many years into this friendship, it's really cut me deep. I feel used. It's also made being at work incredibly lonely, because she was my only friend.\n\nThis is everything you need to know.  You *wanted* her to be your best friend, therefore she *was.*  Also?  As your *only* friend, how could she be anything other than \"best?\"\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot wish something into reality.  There were many things you didn't want to see because they contradicted your desires, would threaten the world you had created--so you noticed nothing.\n\nShe didn't really use you:  you offered and she took what was on offer.  She never thought of you as *her* best friend, nor was she ever obligated to do so.\n\nI think almost all of us have this ghastly moment of recognition, that we've been indulging in childlike behavior, believing that if *we* mean well and do something nice, then other people will automatically treat us in kind.  I believe this is especially prevalent in women because we are socialized to be endlessly nice and self-effacing.\n\nSo, yeah, she was never the person you thought she was--**but she never pretended to be otherwise.**  You were and (presumably) still are lonely, so you needed someone you could pour yourself into and there she was.\n\nI am so sorry, OP.  Please continue as you are and start finding *real* friends.  No, you won't find them immediately, but simply taking part in activities with like-minded people gives you a social life.  And never put all your eggs in one basket like this again:  it hands far too much power to the other person, whether they want it or not.",
            "Since the invitations are out  ask her about the venue again. It lets her know that you know you're not invited in a totally non-confrontational way and might force her to tell you why.

            "I\u2019m late to this thread, but I\u2019m going to offer a suggestion anyway.\n\nGet her a wedding card (no gift/check, just a nice card), and say something like \u201cI know I won\u2019t be there on your big day, but I still wanted to get you guys a nice card\u201d.\n\nThat way, if you ARE invited, she\u2019ll correct her error on the spot, and if you AREN\u2019T invited, you don\u2019t look petty by bringing it up (after all, you\u2019re offering well wishes and a token gift).\n\nIt\u2019ll cost 6-8 dollars (or whatever a nice wedding card goes for), but you\u2019ll know exactly where you stand, AND will have the high ground when/if you start wrapping up the relationship.",

I'm even the one doing the brunt of the planning and prep- if a friend or coworker of my partner had a fucked up address on the invite that didn't make it to them or if I forgot them somehow.. my partner wouldn't know unless directly confronted! Particularly since she invited others from the office it's not like there was a hard line on \"no work friends\" (which people do.. weddings are expensive!). Just ask her.

No thanks.. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t want you at her wedding and it took her getting married for you to see her narcissistic true colors after all of these years. She\u2019s self absorbed. You don\u2019t need that type of energy in your life.  \n\nKeep your interactions with her solely work related and keep your distance. The dust will never settle, because once she realizes that you don\u2019t want to deal with her anymore, the air between you will worsen. She might even act like she\u2019s been wronged to others in the office.  \n\nGet another job if it\u2019s hard to work next to her now. But, I\u2019d let this fake work friendship go.",
            "Looking for new jobs on a regular basis is healthy: it gives you an idea of where your industry is headed (trends in job postings) and what skills you should be building/focussing on. \n\nAdditionally, it gives you a good idea of what you're worth. The best way to get a pay bump or change in responsibilities is a new job. \n\nYou've been in your current position for a while. Apply to a few things. Interview around, even if it's just in an informational capacity. You aren't enjoying your current work, and the environment is strained. Sounds like it's time to put some feelers out.",
            "If her Wedding is 2 weeks away from now I wouldn't confront her. She didn't include you in a Bachelorette party or anything. You're just a coworker to her, not a friend. Now you know. She doesn't deserve your friendship, you're just starting to realize that it's all been one sided. She already knows or she'll catch on pretty quickly when you never have lunch with her again. It's her loss. Be nice to her but make things all about business, the only thing you should mention about the Wedding is congratulations and you hope that her and her friends have a wonderful time. Brush it off, she's not worth it.",
            "I wouldn\u2019t bother asking. The point has been made. If anything asking just forces both of you into an even more awkward situation. As hard as it is, I would just move on. The fact that she hasn\u2019t even noticed you distancing yourself is pretty indicative of the fact that she clearly doesn\u2019t value your friendship, it is one sided after all. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you but rest assured cutting her off will make room for someone who\u2019s worthy. Plus, if she\u2019s been that inconsiderate, it\u2019ll be even worse after the wedding. What happens when she shows up to talk about her wedding and tries to show pics and such? Since it\u2019s a one sided friendship, I would keep it strictly professional from now on.\n\nSometimes, those of us who are good to others expect them to be the same way towards us. As nice and idealistic as that is, some people are plain old selfish narcissists and care little for others.",
            "While I agree that asking her is probably the best course of action, I understand if as a non-confrontational person you wouldn't want to ask someone you still have to see and work with all the time. \n\nHow about just bringing up the fact that you're thinking of booking something (weekend away, flying lessons or whatever) on her wedding day. Don't just mention the date, make a point of saying something like, (I thought I might take a trip to ______ over your wedding weekend, I've always wanted to see ____). If she shifts uncomfortably, says good for you and then changes the subject, you know she never had any intention of inviting you. If she thought you were invited she'll ask why you're not coming...",

Even if they're not narcissistic etc. Lots of people don't actively listen.\n\nIt sounds like you're a warm and loving human being who's forgotten that others don't care as deeply or have as much empathy or appreciation for others as you do.\n\nPeople will ask you to listen to their problems. 100s of times. Cry on your shoulder. 100s of times. Then go home and never think about you. That's unfortunate. But it's life.\n\nAnd it's your job to never care more about others than they care about you. To be cognizant of that and be in sync.\n\nI'm sorry for what you're going through.\n\nRemember that people not appreciating you or your friendship doesn't mean others won't. And it certainly doesn't mean you don't have value. You can be the best friend in the world, but if you're friends with people who suck and are selfish then you'll end up feeling bad about yourself.\n\nGive your time and energy to selfless, empathetic, expressive, caring, loving people.

You always stood up for her, listened to her problems and cared for here, and this was not mutual?\n\nIf that is true, I would get out of this friendship. A misunderstanding one can clear up, but an unbalanced relationship not so much.\n\nI have had very similar experiences. A friend of mine I valued dearly, and which I did a lot for, stood me up on short notice at a very high birthday. \n\nWhen the initial hurt was over, this made me rethink the whole relationship and I realized that the feeling was not just as mutual as I thought, and that I gave way more than she did. I quit the friendship that moment. I never looked back, not even in anger. Nowadays I look carefully who I befriend - if it is an unbalanced energy hole, I put a stop to it at some point.",

It happens, I assume that in his mind he was moving into a different life. All I can say is it showed me what he was & what he though of our friendship, and I have not seen him since. I did try once when I was traveling for work to where he lives now - he said he was sick & couldn't get together.

If you think the only way to feel some resolution is by being direct, I might say,  \u201chey, your wedding is coming up! I\u2019ve enjoyed listening to your updates as you\u2019ve progressed in your plans. Am I out of line to think I might have been invited? No pressure, I understand that there\u2019s a finite number of people that can be invited, but I\u2019m trying to sure-up my calendar.\u201d  If you\u2019ve decided it\u2019s not worth it to you to be that emotionally vulnerable,  you might accept the idea that you are not as close as you felt. If you do this, I would try to create some distance, but keep relationship friendly and professional. You\u2019ve got a long history, and you\u2019re co-workers,  so it\u2019s probably best just to wish her well. Some people are givers and some are takers. You sound like a giver. She helped you find your job, and you\u2019ve been really supportive and kind. She\u2019s likely benefitted more from the friendship, but you can stop investing. You can give the time and emotion you gave to this friendship to other people, while maintaining civility. Something I\u2019ve had to learn the hard way is that  some people in my life are co-workers who I enjoy, teammates who share a hobby, some are likeminded in our volunteer efforts, and some have a many things in common with me and look after my feelings. The later I call my friends. Hoping you feel better soon, whatever the outcome.",

It sucks to discover the relationship wasn't what you thought, but now that energy has been freed up for other, more constructive things. And, I suspect, you will definitely be quicker to notice if someone isn't emotionally good for you. This is a good thing! Life is too short to waste it on energy vampires.",
            "Oh my gosh, I do not think you should ask her why you were not invited! It sounds like she is not as close with you as you think. I only invited a handful of my co-workers to my wedding, and it was a little awkward with a few other co-workers not invited. Sometimes there just isn't enough room. The problem with your coworker is she is your best friend at work! That's so bizzare that she wouldn't invite the person she spends the most time with at work. I would keep trying not to get stuck listening to her talk as often, and make other friends at work who talk with you instead of at you.\n\nGood luck!",
            "It's possible she didn't send you an invite because it was so obvious you were coming.  I would recommend that instead of giving her the cold shoulder you ask \"am I invited?\" directly.  If there's an awkward silence and a no then your cold shoulder is justified and should continue.   If it is yes she probably has a good explanation.   From how you explain it, it seems like you were an incredibly obvious person to invite.   In my experience sometimes when planning stuff like that it's easy to focus on the people who aren't as obvious + distant relations as opposed to best friends who are a given.",
            "She is so close to you she forgot she didn't invite you and didn't even think to hand deliver an invitation to you.\n\nFlat out tell her \"I haven't gotten an invitation from you. Is this intentional or did it slip your mind?\"",
            "OP please just ask her if your invitation was overlooked or if you were genuinely not invited for some reason.\n\n\nI spent weeks following up with my wedding guest list chasing up RSVPs from people whose invitations allowed up super late or not at all (some of them didn't even show up until after the wedding which was Annoying bc we sent them out 8 weeks in advance).   It would be really horrible if her to talk about the wedding with you this incessantly if you're not invited ...",
            "You should really speak to her about it. I had two situations I can tell you about that make me say you should speak to her. I had a college friend that I was close to that I thought didnt invite me to her wedding and I made a little joke to bring it up once and she said she sent one, but since it was the week of her wedding she just verbally invited me then and there but I couldnt trade work days to go anyway.. \n\nSecond one; I have a long distance friendship with someone that I knew from an online game I played at the age of 12; we dont talk as often because we have different lives in different places but she invited me to her wedding that was all the way in TX regardless of that. We actually met for the first time at her wedding; best thing ever btw.\n\nBut anyway, I'm trying to say you really should talk to her. The length of time you've known someone, how close you think are, made me think you were going to be upset that she didn't ask you to be a bridesmaid. If she invited other coworkers to her wedding, I believe she meant to invite you not just because you work together but because you two are friends on top of that.\n\nMail gets lost a lot, I share the same name as someone on the same street as I and I know I list my house number correctly to receive my mail - yet that other person is always giving me mail of mine from her mailbox. \ud83d\ude44",
            "THIS HAPPENED TO ME. I never got my invite, even went to the bachelorette. I made a reddit thread about it as well and got perfectly mixed reviews. I decided not to bring it up to her and while she was at her honeymoon in Jamaica messaged me saying \u201cwhy weren\u2019t you at my wedding\u201d I broke into tears! Idk who\u2019s fault it is but I personally never received an invite and I was too awkward too ask. This situation could go either way as my friend wasn\u2019t as cold to me at all as yours sounds but I would be blunt and ask her what\u2019s up.",
            "OP! I hope I'm not too late. I just got married in December and I found out just how stupid and unreliable the postal system is. Several people never received their save the dates or invites. You should definitely ask her if she sent it! It will NOT be weird. \n\nI really doubt she would continue to discuss the wedding details with you if she didn't invite you. I think it's very likely the invitation just didn't get to you. She's probably wondering why you haven't RSVPed to her wedding yet.\n\nIf you ask her and she tells you she didn't invite you, then you can be mad, but don't ruin your friendship by jumping to assumptions. Communication is key.",
            "You feel like she owes you? Nah, she doesn't have to invite you. Don't worry about it. Just be yourself and if you feel like listening to her, go ahead, if you don't, don't. I think she's a biiiiii.... but it's good she showed her true colors.",

            "You said that she hand delivered them to people at the office. Is it possible that she just assumes you will be going and she doesn't need to give you an invitation because you guys have been friends for so long?",
            "This doesn't make any sense. You need to talk to her instead of jumping to conclusions.",
            "I noticed a lot of comments are like, \"Why won't OP just say something?!\" But I can see why it's so hard for you to proceed. It's feeling unheard and unseen that's really problematic, not the lack of an invite. Even if your friend comes up with a valid excuse, it probably won't help you just put it all behind you and move on. The wedding situation changed your perspective of your friend.\n\nOf course this is a much more challenging issue to bring up than just saying 'Why didn't I get an invite?' But it's an issue that deserves attention and you have a right to talk it out. For tough situations like these, \"I feel...\" statements and being as honest as possible are good tactics, I think. You've come to a point where you're already distancing yourself if she blows up at you calling her out, and I think that's better than pretending nothing is wrong...but don't create too much distance before you try to reach a resolution.",
            "Ask about the invite. It's possible something happened to it in the mail. Hell, she could be having these same feelings as to why you haven't accepted the invitation yet.",

The part about all the talk being about them constantly really struck a chord with me. They want someone for emotional support but they don\u2019t want to put any labor into the relationship. I would straight up ask her why she didn\u2019t invite you though, I\u2019d be really interested to know why.",
            "Ask her questions about the wedding. Like details about her dress, food at the party, etc. If you were invited she will probably say \"you'll see it when you get there\" and you can mention to her that you haven't been invited.",
            "Honestly, it sounds like you're a friend due to proximity for this woman, not a friend through shared interests. Every instance of interaction you mentioned sounds like it takes place in the office environment, not with mutual friends or outside of work.\n\nI get that *you* don't have any other friends that you feel close to, and that you find relationships hard to deal with. A lot of people are like that, but others are not. You also pointed out certain patterns that indicate either this relationship is very low on her friendship scale, or she's on the narcissistic spectrum, or both.\n\nIf she delivered invitations to people at work, those are either people she also has a relationship with *outside* of work--or those are relationships she's currying to advance her career progress. There's nothing wrong with that; a lot of business is centered around relationships. But you don't have that to offer her, it seems.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with having a relationship that has specific boundaries. If you enjoy chatting with this woman *at work* just realize that that's the *limit* of the relationship--it's a superficial \"proximity\" relationship that won't last once it isn't convenient to your work flow. \n\nBased on what you've said, I guarantee that once she is promoted or changes jobs, and you aren't in the same office, the friendship will disappear. \n\nI'm sorry you invested more emotional work into it than she has, but now you know what *type* of a relationship it is, try not to take it personally. It doesn't mean anything is wrong with you, it just means your compatibility is limited with this person.\n\nWe all have friendships at different levels, and learning to recognize when you're putting more into it than the other person is willing to reciprocate is part of being friends.\n\nTake it as a life lesson, accept the limitation, and how *you* choose to go forward from here is up to you. It isn't necessary to confront her about the wedding; take the lack of invitation as a signal and move forward accordingly.\n\nGood luck to you!",
            "You sound like an awesome friend..She does not. I'd ask her why you haven't received an invitation and other work friends have, just incase it is a mistake. Although, surely, she would have asked why you haven't responded to invite yet, if she had have sent one out. \n\nIf she hasn't sent one, I'd definitely take that as a sign that it's a one way friendship and you are being used. Stay friendly with her, in a professional way, but, move on. Make new friends and don't invest any time in her anymore. \n\nYou sound like a nice person. I wish you well.",
            "I just want to warn you a bit about something. \n\nI have a friend who, when I ask her advice, she is always saying things like \"Go confront them!\" or \"You should let them know how you feel,\"  and when that is great advice for dealing with people who care about you, it really is not helpful when dealing with people who don't.\n\nOne particular example: I followed that advice with an ex-boyfriend who was being horrible to me after we broke up - like over-the-top rude in social situations.  I confronted him and got a slight look of satisfaction from him, like he knew he got to me. No resolution, no feeling anything other than anger at myself for listening to her and exposing myself to him.\n\nYour friend is acting kind of crazy with how rude she is being, and clearly showing that she completely lacks empathy.  Why confront her?  Do you think she'll suddenly realize she's an asshole?  I doubt it.  It takes major trauma for assholes to change, and you telling her you are miffed may not even register with her. \n\nYou kind of already answered the question about how she feels about you.  I think you should just move on and avoid her.  Be happy in the fact that you won't have to buy another wedding gift, or sit through another boring reception.  (She sounds like an asshole, and I doubt she would have the mental capacity to plan a wedding that was actually fun for the guests).",
            "You\u2019ve gotten a lot of great advice. I\u2019m going to concentrate on one of your edits. You described what happens when you are put in a position where you have to confront someone. \n\nHave you sought counseling for this? If not, you should. Or at least take assertiveness training. \n\nOne thing to explore is what your fear is. It\u2019s fear of something that keeps you from being able to stand up for yourself. \nFear of the unknown is very real. Fear of not knowing what\u2019s going to happen. Fear of being ridiculed. Fear of being successful. Fear of being ignored. \n\nAll of these lend to, what happens if any of these happen? It\u2019s possible you don\u2019t know how to handle the situation if any of those things happen. \n\nYou should read, a lot, about how to handle situations that you\u2019re uncomfortable in. Then put that into practice. Once you face these things and learn how to handle these situations, you won\u2019t be a self-described doormat anymore. \n\nGood luck!",
            "It\u2019s actually kind of telling about the true nature of the relationship that you describe her in the title as a \u201ccolleague\u201d and not \u201clife long friend\u201d so I kind of wonder why that is.",
            "As difficult as it may be for you to say, I think if you want to try and save the friendship, then you should mention it to her.\n\nI think it's really callous of someone to tell you all about their wedding plans, the invites, where its' going to be with you at lunch every day and then not even talk about why you weren't invited. She should have at least talked to you if she cared about your feelings.\n\nI feel like this is someone who has lunch with you seemingly everyday and chats with you a lot. They should at least be considering inviting you. Especially if they are using you as a soundboard for all of their ideas and excitement about their upcomming wedding.\n\nI personally think you need to address this or it will always be something that you have in the back of your head whenever you guys talk to each other.  If you don't you won't be able to get past it and ever feel like this person is your friend.\n\nAt least if you ask, you have a chance at knowing the thought process behind it and can maybe move past it. \n\nIs it possible she just forgot to hand you your invite? Maybe she thought she gave it to you, but lost it instead? I know I would be heartbroken if a friend felt slighted because I had misplaced their invite and forgot. \n\nDo you know if she has hit her RSVP date yet? If she hasn't, maybe talk to her. If you don't want to confront maybe you can wait until that date and then if she is your friend she would hopefully talk to you directly to know your RSVP plans if the invite was in fact lost.\n\nOtherwise you will need to address this and then consider what this means to your friendship moving forward. I just don't see how sitting back and allowing this situation to fester is going to allow for you two to continue being friends OP.",
            "Ask her today if you are invited to the wedding.  Do it face to face so you can read her expression and body language when you ask. Tell her you did not receive an invitation.  Stuff happens. Mail handling can be problematic without anyone realizing it. She may be wondering why you haven\u2019t responded to her invitation.  \n\nRegarding the quality of the mutuality of your friendship with her, ask yourself if your friendship has always been so one sided or if it has grown into one sidedness during recent years.  If it is the latter, I wonder if her distraction with her SO, the concept of getting married, and the wedding preparations have her brain so full that she is not responding in appropriate ways. \n\nI suggest resolving the wedding invitation part of things first, then wait a good while for her to come back to earth after the wedding, and talk to her about your friendship. \n\nSometimes, over time, people become more themselves.  It\u2019s not always a good thing. I\u2019m hoping she has just been very emotionally distracted for awhile which has led to her self centeredness  in your friendship.",

I started to comment by saying you should ask her straight out why you weren't invited, but after learning she *hand delivered* the invitations and has a bachelorette party you also weren't invited to it's pretty clear this was a deliberate snub.  She sounds like a narcissist... \n\nI agree with the other comments that she obviously doesn't feel the need to return your friendship, and is probably hoping you will ask so she can have that power over you.  \n\nPersonally I would just try and ignore it and just be glad you've finally seen her true colours before she drains more of your time and energy.  Keep work conversations to business and when she talks about her wedding just say \"thats nice\" and change the subject. Shut her down and make like you have better things to do than worry about her or her wedding.",
            "No comment that i could find through slowly scrolling and barely paying attention has mentioned that she has done at least one thing for you when she got you the job",
            "First, are you sure she didn't invite you? Maybe the invite was lost in the mail. If You really thought you were that close, you should be able to outright ask.\nIf she didn't invite you and the whole relationship is so one sided, maybe you should step back for good. It is entirely possible that you viewed the relationship at work as much more important than it was too her.",
            "Your invite could have gotten lost in the mail! This happened to me last year. They asked why I hadn't RSVPed and I was like, I thought I wasn't invited!",
            "Maybe it was an oversight from someone else. Talk to her.",
            "You NEED to talk to her.  Adulting is hard.  Take a deep breath.  Think about what u r going to say beforehand.   And ask.  You.  Can. Do. This.",
            "The only thing I can possibly think of is that she already assumed you'd be going, invite or not. Why else would she share literally every detail with you? And given how one-sided this relationahip is, she very well might not have even thought that you'd appreciate one.\n\nI think asking her (or maybe even her fianc\u00e9) about this is definitely the right call, but given what this has helped you see in her, slowly separating may be a good addition as well.\n\nBut if it helps, I don't think she's intentionally hurting you, there's just a good chance her self-centeredness is so high she just didn't realize you needed/wanted one.",
            "Maybe you can say something indirect like, have a great wedding, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the pictures, and then gauge her reaction.",
            "Listen, I really think there\u2019s a LARGE POSSIBILITY that you were intended to receive an invitation. You need to ask her because stuff gets lost in the mail, gets put in the wrong mailbox, gets lost in transport. It could be sitting underneath the couch at her place right now. You don\u2019t know. People who don\u2019t invite you, don\u2019t talk about planning with you to this extent. I think you might actually be letting your emotions get the better of you and you need to ask, because odds are she assumes your going and hasn\u2019t put second thought to not receiving your RSVP.",
            "I was in such a similar situation recently. You know what I really was surprised about regarding the while thing: it turned me into a cynical asshole. Co workers started banging, friends with both of them or so I thought. Gal was already engaged to a another guy. Guy and girl basically asked me to keep my mouth shut and I did. They are now married with a kid on the way. Was not invited to the wedding, realized when I saw on social media to RSVP if you got an invite. Looked back on my interactions with these people and realized they only reached out when they wanted something from me. Cut them out of my life. Wish them luck, but fuck that shit yo. Sorry about your situation OP.",
            "It's way more likely that your invitation got lost in the mail and SHE'S mad that you haven't RSVPed and haven't mentioned it. \n\nYou're both being ridiculous. Just ask her. \"This is really awkward, and I should have said something earlier, but I haven't received an invitation to your wedding. Should I take that to mean I'm not invited?\"\n\nIf she says yes, you can just say \"That's really hurtful. I've really been there for you and been listening to you talk about this wedding for a long time. It's making me rethink our friendship.\" (Which is what you're already thinking)\n\nThere is NO way that conversation is going to be more awkward than the first day of work after her wedding when neither of you have said anything. For the love of god, just ask her.",
            "It\u2019s super possible the invite got lost in the mail.... I really can\u2019t imagine someone talking nonstop about their wedding plans to someone who they didn\u2019t invite. \n\nBut considering it sounds like you\u2019re finding your friendship was totally unfounded to begin with, I\u2019m not sure if you even see a point in that at this point. It\u2019s okay to just cut ties and let toxic people go.",
            "Following. I wanna know what she says when you ask",
            "Just ask her if your invitation got lost in the mail. It probably was just that.",
            "Wow, that really sucks and it totally feels like they're using you to make themselves feel better. Reciprocating is a huge part of any relationship, and it just seems like this individual doesn't want to make the effort to have a deep connection with you. As someone who is an avid social dancer, and been to almost 30 weddings, you're not missing anything. People have lists and sometimes they just can't have everyone they want at their wedding.  Honestly, it hurts, but that shouldn't affect your friendship if you still want one with this person. The same thing has happened to me a few times with people that I would see once or twice a week for several years. IMO, if you're upset then bring up the invitation situation with the individual and see what they say. I'd be willing to bet, 1. They don't see you as a close friend and didn't think to have you at the wedding, or 2. They just couldn't accommodate any more friends at their wedding.",
            "There were two instances where I (F) was not invited to a friend\u2019s wedding (both male).  One I asked straight up, the other I found out many years later.  Both were because the future wife didn\u2019t like me / felt threatened by me.  Could that be your case?",
            "She's too selfish to have in your life.",
            "Just ask her, there's so many reasons why such a thing could happen. Just ask her so you know. I mean, she might be randomly mad at you, or perhaps it was just obvious to her that you're invited and didn't need an invite. Ask her directly, she's the only one with a proper answer.",
            "There's nothing else I can really say besides sorry. It sucks when you realize a close relationship is actually super one sided. I had one - we were childhood friends, but eventually we grew apart and then, suddenly, I realized we weren't even friends anymore. Broke my heart, but I have friends now that are REAL friends, not the type you out grow or need to talk to all the time to keep the friendship. \n\nI hope you can find friends who give as much as you do.",
            "OP if you can\u2019t even ask your \u201cfriend\u201d about the invitation then you\u2019re right to get the idea that this isn\u2019t much of a friendship. \n\nLife is too short to waste it on people like her. you need to take a stand for yourself even if it just means asking about the invitation. \n\nWe accept the love we think we deserve and if you keep acting like a doormat who doesn\u2019t even have the maturity to ask when something upsets her then you\u2019ll always get treated like this",
            "I would probably try asking her what happened in a non confrontational way. It's  \\*\\*possible\\*\\* that she didn't realize she overlooked inviting you. I accidentally forgot to invite one of my uncles to my wedding. Now, granted, it was an uncle I haven't talked to in years, but I truly felt bad about it when I realized I forgot to include him, and definitely did not intend it to be a slight. It just slipped my mind with all the other wedding planning stuff.  It's also possible that she likes you and would have liked to have had you there but the venue didn't allow for her to include everyone she wanted.\n\nHowever, it's also quite possible that the friendship meant more to you than it did to her or that she is a really self centered person. :(  I am sorry that you have been hurt by this. If you're still open to trying to work through this with her, I would try to have a calm discussion about it and give her a chance to explain at least. However, if you feel like you can't see yourself getting over this, maybe it's for the best to leave it alone and just distance yourself from her.",
            "Well it sounds like your not going to be friends anyway, so ask her why you weren't invited. Say you've been close for so long why didn't she invite you? She'll either be \"shocked\" that you didn't get your invitation, or she'll stammer and mumble something. Your friendship is basically over already. Theres only 2 ways this can end, she'll denie not inviting you, start an argument so she can tell everyone you were jealous, or you can pretend you believe her BS reason for not inviting you, and then you can continue your one way \"friendship\"  what you are is friend in need, when she needs something from you, she'll be your friend. Tell her you need something from her, a ride to the airport before work, or ask her to take on some of your work because you have to leave early for about 2 weeks for appointments. Ask her anything that requires her doing something for you, I'll bet she won't do one thing to help you. I've had \"friends\" like that before, sometimes we try to help the wrong people. For every one person who gives of themselves to help someone, there are 50 people who are happy to take, and give nothing back.",
            "She sounds like a narcissistic a hole don\u2019t put too much effort into people who don\u2019t care\nIt will only hurt you I have been there I get this.\nBut to me I would feel the same I wouldn\u2019t bother with this woman she seems to be a user/drainer \nThose people are toxic and not worth it.\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you\nBut there are so many others out there who would be better friends/people. \nMove on and if she wants to reach out to you then balls in her court she can make the effort next time..,and every other time after that",
            "No. You are not overreacting or being dramatic. Your feelings are valid since you've invested so much time and effort for her. So whatever it is you are feeling, it's perfectly normal. However, silent treatment or not recognizing the issue is not going to help you either. You have to talk to her and ask her why did she not invite you on her wedding. Tell her what you really feel and let her know that it hurt you. \n\nPlease remember this. Whatever her response maybe, whether or not you are going to give her another shot in your life, you should always thank yourself for being brave. Being brave in a sense that, no matter how many times you've felt used (by your dear friend) or felt disregarded, you're still here.... Breathing. Functioning. You are still you and no one can take that away from you. So what if you've lost a friend? I'm sure you haven't met your \"bff's for life\" type of friend. So what if she didn't invite you to her wedding? Heck, do not invite her too in your wedding! So what if you are feeling lonely? Atleast you know who really are those people who you should/shouldn't make an effort into. Atleast now you know who really cares for you.",
            "I think I would have to ask, I know there are some mixed responses but I would wind myself up wondering why I didn\u2019t get invited when she\u2019s invited other coworkers who aren\u2019t as close to her, and not me, the one who\u2019s there for her and spends the most time with her.\n\nHave your colleagues who are invited aware that you aren\u2019t invited? How have they reacted? Are they surprised? I wonder if one of them has mentioned it to her or asked her",
            "Next time you see her politely ask what happened to your invitation. Just drop it in a conversation like normal. Hey I still haven't got my invite maybe it's lost in the post? For example. Also you need to look into this friendship more. Try small things like asking for help with a project at work.  See how she responds. You may want to start cultivating more work based friends. Don't go full on stat with small things eg how was your day etc..  You will either make more friends or at least increase your happiness at work.  I know how deeply this has hurt you but it's given you a chance to look at this from an outsiders perspective. Yes she may have been using you but until now you didn't really see it.  You can reevaluate this friendship and see if it's worth saving.  If not then it's time to move on. She will find another person to vent to and you will find more friends that maybe you will even get along better with.",
            "A word of caution, OP. You are not only a friend but a colleague. As such you have been overly supportive of her, sharing her workload etc. People at the office must have noticed that, beside you eat lunch together and are/were openly friends. Now she openly disassociates from you, giving invitations to others but not you etc. Why suddenly she feels the need to do so? Are you no longer useful?",
            "Okay so, you asked if anyone had had a similar experience, and I have. I had a close knit group of girlfriends in high school, and we all stayed very much in touch through college/military for years. One of them, Danielle, started dating someone else we hung out with then. When they got engaged it was a big deal. At first, Danielle stated she didn't want to pick favorites, so we'd all just be part of the wedding party with no titles. Well, that didn't last. Shortly before the wedding I found out they asked my best friend Amanda to marry them, and some other outside friends to be the wedding party. What was I in all this? A guest. I was incredibly hurt. As i watched them plan and Amanda get her notary license I grew more angry, until one night Danielle called me and I let it all out. We had a huge fight, I told her how hurt I was that I wasn't involved when we had been close since 9th grade (there were 4 of us, we were inseparable for years). Lots of things were said and done that to this day I'm embarrassed by... But I don't regret telling her. We stopped talking after that for a couple months; I missed the wedding. Awhile later we reconnected and said our sorrys, and things went back to normal. We've since stopped talking for other reasons.\n\nI never really understood why I wasn't a part of it. She became a good friend again after but our closeness was never really the same. It's almost like a breakup--the same feelings of being betrayed and forgotten. I got over it but I never trusted her the dame way again.\n\nMy advice in your situation would be to ask. With the way you describe her behavior this could be a complete misunderstanding. But it could also be opposite. I'm hoping it's the former for you, and asking her why could relieve all the tension this has caused you. I know for me, knowing a reason helps me move on from whatever it is. I hope you two can discuss this, and I'd like to add please keep it civil. Friend fights can get dirty and cut deep since we know each other on a personal level others never see. Mine was years ago when I still went for the throat, and even though she and I no longer speak I hate the way I acted about it.",
            "You can just say \"hey, this is really awkward, but I didn't get an invite, and I just wanted to check that was intentional and it hasn't got lost or anything, because if you did invite me and thought I ghosted you I would seem rude\", that way you're asking because you don't want to hurt her feelings, not because you have had yours hurt. If she says she didn't want you there then you have to accept that she isn't your friend and let her go.",
            "I had a bundle of 40 invitations to my wedding returned to my parents address because of some mess up with the postage. They didn't show up until two weeks before the wedding even though I'd mailed them out long, long before then. Luckily for me they were all local and I could hand deliver and explain the situation, but there were several families who thought I was snubbing them. So much drama. \n\n\n\n\nBasically, your work environment is already awkward and you are a grown up who should use her words. If it's not a mistake then you can go full Ice Queen and not look back. If it is a mistake then maybe you're giving the bride a heads up that some of her invitations didn't get where the should.",
            "It would be quite fun to say something along the lines about how you're looking forward to going, especially if you know the location from one of the other coworkers who were invited or she let it slip. Make it awkward for her to have to outright say you aren't invited or just to see what she says. And if she does throw you a pity invite to try to save face, show up and have a good time with others so you actually get something from this relationship before you fade out on her. It's non-confrontational but still gets you that closure you might be wanting.",
            "I would DEFINITELY ask her if she'd sent me an invitation! She couldn't be that thick-skinned as to discuss the whole wedding with you, but not invite you.",
            "Many years ago one of my closest friends got married and a lot of her invites got lost in the post - mine included. It was quite a way from me, but I still would have gone. I didn't say anything for a long time because I didn't want a response that I may not have liked and in the end it was she who mentioned it, asking me why I hadn't sent an RSVP. Told her I hadn't got an invite and she was most apologetic. I didn't go to the wedding because I just couldn't make it, after all that, the wedding went ahead (a very stressful service, by all accounts - long story) and that's that. But 20 odd years later, we're still great friends and all is forgotten... (Also because they're no longer married & he's an arse!). \nIf you're as good friends as you suggest you are, you have to say something. For two reasons....\n\n1. Because good friends should be able to talk about these things. There could be a very good reason why you've not had an invite. It got lost in the post, it never got sent (by accident), or your *friend * really isn't such a good friend after-all. Either way, you need to know.\n2. Not saying anything gives this *friend * free licence to continue using you as their emotional crutch and the one to go to to tell the latest bit of news about this wedding. Especially if she is, in fact, pretending to be the friend you always thought she was, but may now not be. If you're non-confrontational, then you should be able to ask her without insinuating she's cheating at this friendship, or doesn't want you at the wedding. BUT you have to be prepared for the answer, which might be one you won't like. But at least you'd know for definite and you can make an informed choice as to whether you believe its a friendship worth continued investment. Good luck. Hugs X",
            " i understand this feeling completely as im going through something similar right now. It sucks realizing that someone you cared about and viewed as a best friend actually doesn\u2019t give a fuck about you. I don\u2019t have any advice bc i haven\u2019t figured anything out in my own situation, but i thought i\u2019d share anyway idk \ud83d\ude10",
            "If you consider her such a great friend, why aren\u2019t you communicating your feelings to her? You\u2019ll get your answer much more quickly and be able to move on with your life.",
            "My husband forgot to invite one of his good work friends to our wedding. When he was making the list, her name got lost in the shuffle. Everyone kept telling her it was obviously an oversight and to just *ask my husband about it*, but she wouldn\u2019t and no one else did either, and she didn\u2019t bring it up until after the wedding when she sadly asked my husband if she had offended him in some way. \n\nHe was absolutely horrified and apologised dozens of times, but also was a bit frustrated that she or someone else didn\u2019t just SAY SOMETHING. It was obviously an accident\u2014he didn\u2019t invite literally all his other team members at work and then gleefully cackle in private while talking openly about the plans to throw them in her face. \n\nWedding planning is a messy process and someone always slips through the cracks somehow\u2014envelope gets lost, person had the wrong address, whatever. \n\nI think it\u2019s much less likely that your friend is some kind of sociopath who is rubbing her wedding in your face, and much more likely that a simple mistake happened somewhere. \n\nI get being non confrontational, OP, but you\u2019re an adult and sometimes adults need to use their words and just talk about this stuff. She can\u2019t read your mind and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s actually happening until you ask. I don\u2019t mean to be harsh, but people are eventually going to stop sympathising with you if you consistently refuse to try to solve simple problems yourself before blowing them up into relationship-ending fireballs. \n\n\u201cHey, Kate? I\u2019ve noticed everyone else has gotten their invitations, and I wasn\u2019t invited. I\u2019m a bit hurt by that; have I offended you somehow?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all you have to do. And do it before the wedding. It might be awkward, but it\u2019s really the only way to handle this properly. If it turns out she *didn\u2019t* invite you, then she\u2019s clearly being beyond rude and you can politely pull away from the relationship and the wedding talk. Or you\u2019ll find out she\u2019s having a family-only wedding. Or whatever. Much more likely it was just an accident. Whatever the answer, you can\u2019t know and respond to it until you ask."

David and I broke up. I moved away and cut off contact with everyone. Also, turns out I'm gay. Life is good now.**\n\nShortly after this post, David and I had a sit-down talk in which I said I was no longer comfortable going over to his place. I showed him this post and how he was getting roasted in the comments. He agreed and started coming over to my place more. However, this became more lax with time and laziness and he started asking me to come over to his house, which I hesitatingly did. Basically, it backslid into how things were before, and he made no real effort to change anything. At no point did David consider moving out, and as far as I know, they're still roommates.\n\nIt's been a while now, so I honestly can't remember if John ever made an attempt at making an apology, but at any rate he never made an apology I deemed to be genuine and he always made me uneasy. No more serious incidents occurred. John never touched me physically. For this, I feel exceedingly fortunate.\n\nA few months after I made that post, I started wanting to move away for various reasons (mostly wanting a change of scenery and culture), and I realized that I didn't consider my relationship valuable enough to make me want to stay. That was over a year ago.\n\nWe broke up, I moved away, and in quarantine I've reconsidered my sexuality and am now dating a lovely, thoughtful, and supportive woman. My life is much better now and I see that that I was allowing myself to be treated in a very horrible and toxic way. I also see that everyone in that house was -- in a way -- gaslighting me into thinking that John's abuse wasn't so bad in an effort to not \"rock the boat\". No one, at any point, made any effort to stand up for me, including my supposed romantic partner (which, honestly, now disgusts me). I'm not in touch with anyone from that circle anymore and honestly, good riddance. I'm so relieved that I never have to see any of them again.\n\nAnyway, despite being in lockdown and living in a deep, existential anxiety, I'm very happy and life is drama-free (aside from the fact that I still have to come out to my family, lol). Thanks everyone for pushing me in the right direction.\n\n**EDIT:** I was not expecting this to blow up in the way that it has. \"David\", I know you have a reddit account, and if you're seeing this, I hope you're doing well. \"John\" is hella toxic. Good luck with everything.\n\n**EDIT 2: Seriously, this response is overwhelming. Thank you all so much for your support and well-wishes. I hope all of my future coming-outs go this well. <3**",

            "You are such a child. First off, in your initial post you said John attempted to sit down and apologize to you via text, but you ignored it because you had zero interest in making things better. So for you to say he never attempted to apologize is pure bs and a lie. I'm not defending the guy, but you're full of bs yourself.\nSecond, how do you leave a relationship simply because you want a change of scenery and culture?? No one just leaves a committed relationship that easily. Very childish. Very. You shouldn't have been in the relationship in the first place if its that easy to end it over something so minor.\nThird, no one in that house gaslighted you. Lmao. Everyone loves to throw that word around nowadays when they don't understand the true meaning of it, or have even experienced it first hand. \nFourth, no disrespect to your personal choices regarding your sexuality, and no disrespect to anyone who identifies as homosexual, but how do you all of a sudden reconsider your sexuality so drastically? Doesn't seem genuine. Seems impulsive, maybe you think its \"trendy\" or there's some other reason behind it.\nThis is gonna sound very judgmental and harsh, but between this post and your last, you need to hear it. Sorry if this hurts your feelings:\nYou seem very attention seeking, impulsive, and whimsical. John was an awful person, but I think you're core is just the same as his, you're just good at being covert about it. Have you ever heard of narcissistic personality disorder? You might have it.\nI was quite surprised with the responses you received in your older post. While yes, the situation you were in was toxic and bad for you, there were so many red flags about your own self displayed by your writing and how you talk about people and situations.Toxic people often attract toxic people, and they balance each other out.\nSick of people's bs.",

            "I'm a little worried how you pigeonhole yourself and your sexuality. The whole \"it's okay everyone, I'm just gay\" thing worries me. This is only because I am concerned that if you and your partner don't work out (which I absolutely hope you do, they sound supportive and lovely), it may send you into a bit of an existential spiral. You be you and love who you want to. As long as they treat you right and you treat them right, you'll be golden.",

I decided I'd have a talk with him, I told him that it was basically really damn inappropriate to find out I have money and start making demands. I told him I have no problems using my finances for our relationship but that he shouldn't automatically expect that I'm going to put out money on very expensive things for him, just because. He seemed very ashamed and agreed that it was a really crappy thing to do and he got carried away and a bit too excited. I told him I understood but to do that was very disrespectful to me and the time we've shared together because it made me feel like all of a sudden my money is what mattered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a little while it seemed all was well, then the other day we were having a minor argument over something that turned into a bigger argument and he said something along the lines of well you don't even want to use what you have for us so maybe you've never fucking cared about me. He got really quiet as though he knew that was a shitty thing to say and we didn't talk until 2 days later. I was really angry, I was going to talk things through with him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever this came the relationship fatality. He told a couple people we're good with, despite me asking him to keep the money quiet, that I was really rich and could afford tons of shit. How did I find out, Saturday we all went drinking together, he gets a bit too much in his system and orders an expensive bottle of wine, one of our friends was like who orders that shit, we're good with our beers and that's too expensive. Our other friend piped up and was like no it's good /u/FamilyHeiress is really rich, she can pick up our tab tonight, cue several other people who I've never told about my family's money suddenly grilling me on why I never trusted them enough to tell them about my money and oh, thought we were friends that kind of thing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI broke up with him the next day. He's been blowing up my phone all day but fuck him, I could have moved past what he said the other day when we were arguing but to tell people I specifically asked him not to something I trusted him so much with. Yeah, I've lost a 3 year relationship and am probably going to lose a few friends as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr talked to my bf, he said he'd make an effort, he didn't, told some of our friends that I was wealthy, they were shocked I didn't trust them with this, I dumped him, may lose some friends soon as well\n\n\nEdit: for everyone asking the bottle was 460\n\n\n\n\nOP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3j5fnj/boyfriend_28m_found_out_how_much_money_i_28f_have/",

He finally realized they didn't want to be asked to pay back the money so he said \"listen guys, I care more about our friendship than the money.

            "The easiest way to answer your friends (who don't really sound like friends, sorry about that) is to simply say, \"exbf was mistaken. My family has money. I do not.\" If they ask for expensive loans or whatever, you just say it's not in your budget. Talk about your budget enough and they'll get the hint. \"Oh, I sew this new Michael Kors purse/amazing 3d printer/rare book. Wish I could have it, but it's not in my budget.\"\n\nAll perfectly true. You set yourself a budget to live within, even if it's well below your means.\n\nOr get friends who understand that concept.",
            "This is an interesting cultural difference. \n\nIn my country everyone can really easily find out what the other person is making by simply asking from the tax office. They will give the information how much the person is paying tax from income and from other sources. It's all public information.\n\nEveryone in my workplace knows what the other guy is making and it's quite common to talk about it. Then I did the mistake of bringing up this topic with my US-colleagues. Their reaction was something akin to me kicking a puppy.\n\nThe other difference is that in my country, any kind of \"smooching\" of other peoples money is a very big no-no. If people go on a date, they usually pay their for their own food. Paying for other person's food is seen more as an insult (you *clearly* don't have enough money to pay for your food).\n\nI lost my point long ago, but it is very sad to find out this side of a person you've been with for a long time. But better now, than later.",

I feel I deserved it. \n\nMy hours sucked, so I'd get like 4 hours some weeks. This is what happens when you have an after school job at a place that closes at 5. It's especially complicated when you can't go to work because of sports. \n\nDespite this, my friends treated me like Mr. Moneybags. I was diligent on not paying for anything more than my fair share, but I was ridiculed for it. \n\n- One friend would buy pizza and share it with everyone but me...unless I paid him. He was happy to drink my soda, but refused to give me pizza like the others. All subsequent pizzas were BYO soda because fuck them. \n- Same friend was candid with others about what I made. Insert everyone hitting me up for a few bucks for lunch (so what - you weren't planning on eating lunch today so you brought none, but now you changed your mind?)\n- Whenever I didn't want to pay more than my fair share, I was called stingy. \n- No one ever paid me back when we were in a situation where someone only had a few bucks on them and I was smart enough to remember to bring a $20 (i.e. lunch at a cafe).\n\nI'm only friends with the one guy who bothered to make things fair for me, and he's on the other side of the country.

But (a) it wasn't his money, (b) he shouldn't have expected you to spend it on him, (c) he NEVER should have told people especially after you specifically asked him not to, (d) he ordered an expensive bottle of wine to show off like a dick, (e) your \"friend\" offered you to pay since you were loaded which is SO disrespectful and flat out preposterous, and (f) for any of your \"friends\" getting butt-hurt over not telling you how much money you have...it's none of their GD business.

            "Wow, that is just beyond shitty. Good for you for not taking any of that crap!\n\nA few years ago I inherited quite a bit of land when my grandfather died, worth maybe half a mil USD. I did tell people but thankfully none of my friends ever expected anything from me. The only thing that ever happened was that a week after I sold some timber and got a nice lump sum of about 20k$, one of my friends dog got extremely sick, like she needed an operation the day after at the latest or she would die sick. My friends sister (also my friend) who knew about the money I just got came to me and informed me of the situation and I immediately offered the 900$ to get the dog the help she needed. That was over two years ago, my friend has payed me back in full in small, monthly payments and her dog is still alive and well. They never expected me to pay even though the sister knew I could, when I offereed my friend the money she had no idea I had it and almost refused. After that I've recieved a lot of thanks for helping but my remaining inheritance has never been brought up again. That's a more reasonable reaction in my world..",
            "People who respond like that around money (buying expensive things just for the heck of it, spending thoughtlessly just because they can) are often the *worst* to actually let get anywhere near it. \n\nAs unfortunate as this situation is honestly getting to see this side of things before you do consider something more permanent (that might involve sharing finances in any way) is probably good. This man sounds like he's going to drain that nest egg dry and honestly his reactions seem a little immature just in general. \n\nAs to your friends: I see some people are say to deny everything. Just to provide an alternative perspective: I'd say if they're really friends, come clean with both the situation and why you didn't feel it important/a good idea to bring up. You probably have emotional reasons for wanting to keep it private, and as they have an immediately recent example of your now-ex getting weird over the money situation, asking for things, and making situations awkward to reference.",
            "Those friends are not friends. You can afford to lose them - just like you can afford many other things they can't (sorry, I had to :P)\n\nI come from lower-middle class, but I was fortunate enough to land a scholarship to a rich private school in a very wealthy city. Many of my friends had multi-million dollar vacation houses, had parents who were European royalty or who owned major foreign companies, and owned at least 5 cars, most of which were luxury class, etc. \n\nI always shamelessly enjoyed the perks of having rich friends:\n\n* House parties that made the Great Gatsby pale in comparison\n\n* High-speed cruising on the freeway in a convertible Maserati\n\n* Underage invitations to privately owned clubs\n\n* Many more...\n\n**BUT**, unless I was offered, there was never a time I would get something around them that I couldn't afford. I would never dare ask them to pay for anything of mine without offering to pay them back if I was short on cash that day. And never would I expect anything from them that is related to finance. \n\nIf people find out you're rich and treat you differently because of it, they're just shitty. But that sad part, is it's most likely not their fault. Both my parents grew up in relative poverty, so their outlook on money is very different. I'm fairly certain that, had I not been exposed to wealthy friends, I would have shared their mentality: *we don't talk about money because it's a hindrance and it prevents us from doing what we want.*\n\nMy rich friends saw the opposite: *we don't keep money a secret because it's what gives us our freedom.*\n\nNaturally, if these friends of yours were only exposed to the former, jealousy would strain the relationship. It's simply a product of their upbringing, but you can't do much a bout it at this point :(\n\nGood of you to move on, and I hope you find friends who aren't as effected by a simple convenience of yours.",

            "I think you did the right thing. From what I understand the house for you two was something he wanted not something he had bought already and wanted you to pay for it. People should try to split stuff when they are in a relationship if they can but he clearly just wanted you to buy everything for him ",
            "Good job! Now you can find someone who doesn't care about you for you money, but cares about you as a person!",
            "I'm sorry you had to suffer that. You have the opportunity to find someone trustworthy and less self centered now.\n\nThis is why you find out if they love *you* before they find out about the money. You get to know how they feel about you, and see if the money revelation changes them. You did nothing wrong, and everything right. He broke your trust first by digging, then by breaking his word to you.",
            "The proper response to \"why didn't you trust us enough to tell us about your money?\" was to point to bf and then his douchey friend. That should be a pretty obvious answer to that question.",
            "Wow...\n\nYou did the right thing, and congrats on purging your life of people who value money more than relationships!",
            "It sounds like he didn't like the little talk you had. He still felt that you should be spoiling him so he went and told your friends about how much money you have too. Your real friends might be upset that you didn't share that info but they'll get over it.  I hope you didn't buy that expensive bottle! ",
            "Wow, what a dickhead! Good on you for trying. You'll be ok.  :)",
            "OP I'm really proud of you! It's not only hard to break up with someone when they haven't done anything SPECIFICALLY wrong (cheated, were physically abusive, etc). And for you to do it so efficiently (for lack of a better word) and to realize you need to cut those mooching friends out too, is really awesome.",
            "You did the right thing...  Better to lose 3 years than be stuck with a tool.  The only advice I have is next time, once you can trust your SO, you should have the baggage discussion... This is where you both lay of your baggage, wants, dreams and expectations on the table.  This clears it down to the reality and the mask is off.  That's when the shit gets real and you decide to go from there....   My future wife and I did this on our 3rd date... Married 9 months later... Celebrated 19th anniversary a month ago.   ",

            "I can definitely see getting excited about finding out your SO is wealthy and overreacting, I could see that happening to myself. However it really crosses a line when you bring it up with people against their wishes. Money can cause some people to really change their behavior, and tap into some dark parts of their persona. That's why a lot of lottery winners are advised and often choose to remain anonymous. This situation is awful, but I can't imagine what it'd be like if strangers treated you like this.",
            "Money doesn't change people it just reveals their true nature.  Hell I had been with a girl for 3 years and she told me she was loaded first thought through my head would be, if we ever had kids I hopefully wouldn't have to worry about them being homeless or hungry even if the relationship deteriorated after the fact. I guess he doesn't know of the idea that the way you have so much money is you spend as little as possible.",
            "I'd say you're very validated in the approach that you took. You offered him an opportunity after he started making demands but now that he betrayed your trust and started venting his anger to your friends which is very fucked up. No reason to stay with someone who is so insecure and selfish. Good on you, take care.",
            "I caught this late. Your ex-boyfriend is a selfish and classless moron. I come from some money as well, I was taught from a very young age that people treat you differently if they know that. I was also taught to respect people regardless of the money that they have, judge them on their actions. \n\nMost of my friends never asked me for anything, even when they eventually figured out that I had money. I am pretty generous with my close friends but they never ask for anything outright, and they keep their mouth shut when talking about me to other people. They understand that I am the one that decides when/if someone gets to know about my situation.\n\nWhen it comes to relationships, I had a hard time trusting people so it took me a long time (I am 45) to find someone I trusted enough to let into my life (I had a disastrous LTR in my 20s that did not help as well, but $ were not a factor in that). My wife and I combine everything, I provide for most things but she would NEVER ask me to spend money on her. We have a great life and she loves me for who I am, not what is in my trust fund.\n\nYou learnt a harsh lesson but it will serve you well in the future. You may want to re-evaluate some of those friendships as well, they seem pretty shallow and untrustworthy.\n\nI feel for you and relate to your situation, most people think that everything is easy when you have money. They are wrong, stuff like this is really crappy to deal with.\n\nLike you said, fuck him. Zero Contact Plan and erase him (and some of those 'friend' perhaps) from your life.",
            "A guy like that, I don't care if he loves you or not, is not mature enough to handle finances. You would not want to be with a person who can't put his brain ahead but rather just keep on spending as it comes.",
            "Oh yeah, simple answer is to dump his ass.",
            "Please don't tell me you picked up the wine tab",
            "what a fucking asshole.\n\nnow you are on your way to finding a gentlemen. ",
            "did you pay the tab that night?\n\nbtw if i was to find out a close friend is rich i'd prolly ask as well how come you never told me. but i wouldn't make a big deal or get all aggressive. so if they simply said why didnt you tell us, or were (slightly) offended, i dont think that's a big deal. if they make a huge deal or dont want to be friends with you, that's kind of a not-friendship-material friend.",
            "I'm certainly not rich haha but this is just a lack of character on their part. I would never dream of acting like such a damned pirate. ",
            "He is a fool.  Its not his money.  Tell him to go get his own.\n\nThe only time it matters is if you are not sharing expenses fairly (and fairly does not always mean equally.)",
            "So sorry that happened to you. \n\nIt baffles me that your friends were offended that you didn't tell them how much money you have. And the fact that one friend assumed you would just pick up their tab after your ex wrongly ordered the bottle in the first place, is shockingly disrespectful to me.\n\nI an so sorry. ",
            "So...single now eh?  ",
            "Fuck yeah, good for you. It's not anyone's money but yours. You were very generous and he just wanted it for himself. Just sign a prenup before you get married to someone",
            "So you're single then...? Hello.",
            "Wow - there are so many better people out there, and you deserve better. I'm sorry your relationship ended like that, but it's great that you respect yourself enough to step out when someone treats you like that. ",
            "Soooo newly single and wealthy eh? You uh... Wanna go get a coffee and talk about it?\n\nHarr. I'm just kidding. I love my wife and kid. Sorry that money killed your relationship. Not everyone is like that. But I have no idea how one would find out that about someone without risking the entire relationship. Good luck.",
            "See... I'm the petty sort of asshole that, if I were in your shoes, would take that trip to Europe to visit family and friends, and take a shitload of pictures, and making sure he sees them. All the shit he thought of doing, like visiting the old Roman ruins or the Black Forests in Germany, just make sure he knows you're there. Rub that shit in nice and hard and deep. \n\nBut, also, 3 years was a hellova long time to spend with someone, and it really sucks it had to come to this. But in the end someone's true nature always comes out. Better now than before you had invested more financially and emotionally. ",
            "Bullet dodged.  I grew up in an area with a lot of people with money (I was one of the ones without it) and it's shitty how some people are.  As a kid I felt bad if a friend had to borrow a horse from someone at her barn so we could go trail riding together (I always brushed the horses and washed them if the weather was warm enough, so most people were fine with it), and I can't imagine WTF makes them think they should be entitled to you buying them things just because.  Eventually you will find good people, as long as you don't get offended at them offering you wine from Trader Joe's.",
            "Can I just say, what an idiot! My ex wife (nothing to do with the money) had quite a substantial amount of savings. In the 13 years we were together, I never once asked her for any financial help, nor did I ever assume that the money was now 'Ours' when we got married. As far as I was concerned 'That was her money'.\nEven when we divorced I never cited nor staked claim to her money.\n\nYour 'EX' sounds like a right knob!",
            "Sorry that happened to you. and fuck him glad you found out now. ",
            "That behavior is unfucking believable. I have friends that I barely know who always are very generous at the bar and buy a round on their turn without a single complaint. To expect somebody to buy a round is so incredibly disrespectful.\n\nTake when you are given but don't keep taking. That is called being rude.",

            "You dodge a bullet",
            "That sucks, but it's good you found out now rather than years into marriage. ",
            "A large percentage of people with little to no money saved are in that situation because they can't manage their own money and live within their means and save. When these people find out their friends have money they want to extend their shitty habits to their friends money as it is all they know.  I want to believe anyone can change, but I know far too many stories of painful failed relationships where they didn't.  You made another good financial decision by dumping him, I hope it doesn't cost you too much in the emotional department. Best of luck. ",
            "If you haven't seen it, I recommend watching the movie \"Holiday\" with Katherine Hepburn. It wonderfully shows how someone *should* react to hearing their significant other has a ton of money. ",

            "I've never been in your situation.. So, yeah... Grain of salt, and all that.\n\n\nOne thing I've always heard was that it's difficult for 'wealthy' people to find real friends (who aren't also wealthy). There's always a concern that people are treating them good because they want some '$'. Not because they really like you.\n\n\nFrom the sounds of what you said. Your Ex liked you before he knew... \n\n\nI can't help but wonder what the conversation would sound like if the gender roles were reversed? Which secrets are OK to keep from one another? Who gets to decide?\n\n\nIf you think he's trying to bully you into spending on him, kick him to the curb. If you think he's upset because you're keeping secrets... Well, that's up to you.\n\n\n Whatever your intentions were, keeping your '$' a secret, could it be argued that you were being deceitful? Not really the best foundation to build on.",

            "Goddamn, this is frustrating. At least it happened before marriage. Any friend who decides to be shitty to you because you don't want to spend your money on them, isn't worth being your friend in the first place. Fuck that.
