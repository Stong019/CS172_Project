        "selftext": "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9vjxrb/how_do_i_23_f_back_away_from_this_guy_31_m/) and original\n\nTLDR: I went out with a regular at my local cafe and it didn't go well. He's maybe a little unhinged. I don't want to lose my favorite coffee shop. How do I handle this without any awkwardness?\n\nSo I had been meaning to post an update about this for a while but never got around to it, and then last night something really big happened and I think its really important that you guys keep in mind that this is all happening in my second language, nobody involved in the story speaks English (Except Sarah a little bit).\n\nSo where we left off with my last post, I had had a conversation with Sarah about Derek that made me feel better. Derek later reached out to me, apologized, said he had drunk too much on an empty stomach and that he was embarrassed about his actions. \n\nI'm sorry you guys, but I agreed to hang out with him again, this time just over coffee. Things were fine and he further integrated me into the neighborhood by introducing me to the people he knows and inviting me to join other neighbors for drinks and such. He opened up to me about a traumatic event that happened to him in his past and about his mental illness. He brought me around his family and his nieces who were all lovely. Other people seemed to adore him. I really liked all of this and we quickly fell into a romantic relationship. \n\nDerek seemed to be almost flaunting the relationship around the neighborhood. I had one other conversation with Sarah where she asked me some questions about how I felt about him. I explained that I liked him but felt confused and that he was moving quickly. She told me, in English so I know she was serious, \"Take your time.\" soon after this Derek broke things off with me very suddenly, and rather forcefully. I found his sudden change of heart very confusing and upsetting. A week after he broke up with me I asked him to come over to my apartment to talk about what happened and we agreed to remain friends, since we'd have to see each other around the neighborhood. \n\nI spoke about all this with Sarah, who told me that she didn't know anything about it and said that she was sorry. About a week after I agreed to remain friends with Derek he invited me out for a drink, gave me a necklace, and we got a little bit intimate, but he clearly told me \"Do not talk about me at the bar.\" which I found very strange. \n\nThis is getting longer than I wanted it to be so I'm going to jump to last night. Sarah and the other woman who owns the cafe are a couple, they've been together for 10 years and they invited me to spend Christmas eve with them since they knew I would be alone. I brought up Derek, of course, and asked them why they thought that he wouldn't want me to talk about him in the Cafe. Silvia played dumb until we had some privacy and then she revealed to me that she and Derek had had a relationship while he was seeing me.\n\nAt first, he had lied to her and said that we were strictly platonic, but that lie quickly fell apart. Sarah said that she wanted to talk to me about it but never had the opportunity because we were always in the cafe. She apologized that some days she had acted cold towards me (which I hadn't noticed) and she said that after a few weeks she had insisted that Derek choose either her or me. Apparently, he chose her. Soon after that, she ended things with him completely. The next evening he invited me out for a drink to try to rekindle things\n\nSo Sarah apologized to me. She said she felt stupid and like a bad person, but that she had been feeling old and unattractive lately (she is 50). I told her that I wasn't upset with her at all, just shocked and that I was sorry I had been so oblivious to the real situation. \n\nSo, I definitely didn't see that coming. I'm not going to confront Derek about this, I'm just going to let it go and move on. Sorry for acting like an idiot. I wish I could say I've learned something but I probably haven't. \n\nMerry Christmas everybody.\n\nTL;DR: Derek and Sarah were together the whole time and Derek was trying to play both of us. Merry Christmas.",

            "wait, wasn't Sarah the one who set you guys up on a date? While she was dating him all along? Why would she do that?\n\nThese people sound strange OP. If you love the coffee shop that much, by all means - but I wouldn't be attending their family christmases and being all buddy buddy.\n\nAnyway, highly anticipated update! Thanks for sharing!",
            "So it seems like Sarah is a piece of shit too if I\u2019m reading correctly? She tried to set you up with someone while she was dating him (?), she knew you liked him and things were moving fast, AND she was already in a 10 year relationship with someone else. \n\nNot saying you need to cut her off, but I think it would be beneficial to expand your friend circle and meet new people. ",
            "Just FYI, I think you might have accidentally used Sarah\u2019s real name in the paragraph where she revealed their relationship to you! \n\nSorry this happened, though. It sounds like you might be better off avoiding all of them for a little bit, and maybe start branching out to meet people elsewhere. They all sound a little nutty to be honest. Best of luck! ",

            "OP seriously, after all the good advice people gave you in your last post, you still continue to make excuses for people who DO NOT have your best interests at heart.\n\nWe already told you that Sarah didn't seem to have your best interests at heart when she made excuses for Derek's behaviour, calling him a \"good boy\" even after you told her how deranged he acted during and after your \"date\". \n\nAlso the fact that she pushed you into seeing him was a bad thing itself. She should never have pressured you like that when you were new there and relying on her judgment. Especially since he was an unemployed 31 year old in the first place!\n\nHonestly I still think you're a little clueless for dismissing Sarah's part in all of this. Seriously, re-read both your posts and imagine if a friend of yours had written it all instead. What would you say to her?\n\nDon't trust random people in a foreign country, male or female, young or old, to have your best interests at heart. You need to learn to trust yourself and your instincts. \n\nIf you didn't already do so (and I bet you didn't, because you never would have given Derek a second chance if you had), please read *The Gift of Fear* by Gavin de Becker.

            "Honestly, just get away from all of these people and do yourself a favor.  This sounds like an absolute shitshow.  Why even get involved?",
            "Wait I\u2019m confused Sarah\u2019s part of a couple with the other woman who owns the shop, and was dating this guy in the cafe?  What?",
            "I always try to give OPs the benefit of the doubt but...this really reads like some exceedingly poor creative writing. The crux of the first post is about him seeing dead people, and then it never gets addressed again. Sara's behaviour is baffling throughout. Details are all really vague- Derek asks OP to stop talking about him in the neighborhood? Sara and her partner invite OP for Christmas and then Sara seemingly tells her then about her affair, but without her partner noticing? ",

            "Lol these people are horrible. I hope you at least learned not to continue a relationship with someone who was over the top and shitty right off the bat, because as you can see, that never turns out well!\n\nI know that these are the only group of people that you\u2019ve really latched onto in this new area but I hope you have the self respect to cut them out. There are better people out there. ",
            "I'd stop hanging out with the entire circle, coffee is a small price to pay for peace of mind. ",
            "This sounds like a bunch of small time drama.  Like Sarah was just feeling bored and decided to stir up some shit, and Derek is an immature weirdo.  It\u2019s probably best to move on, but I bet if you stick around these people, weird dramatic shit like this will keep happening.  Find a new hangout. ",

If you *choose* to continue going there and interacting with these questionable people, you need to stop complaining and live with the situation you have put yourself in.",
            "I remember your OP. I definitely didn\u2019t anticipate that you\u2019d end up dating this guy. Anyway, it seems like a messy social group to be a part of. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want much to do with them. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this sort of drama, with people dating and having crushes and secrecy, is a theme in the cafe social circle. And you, as the \u201cnew girl\u201d, we\u2019re a pawn to add some more drama. \n\nI actually wouldn\u2019t be shocked if Sarah and Derek had a flirtation before you even arrived, she did the whole \u201cWe both know we like each other, but let me set you up with my friend\u201d thing, and seeing you guys together ultimately only made her want Derek more. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting the whole story from Sarah, and why would you, especially in front of her partner she cheated on. ",
            "She was cheating on her partner of 10 years? Am I hearing this right???",
            "They\u2019re both assholes. Swiftly remove them both from your life and don\u2019t look back, you\u2019ll be much better off.",
            "You seriously need to hone your judgement/common sense skills.. holy moly..",
            "I'm older than you but take this with a grain of salt as obviously I'm not there in person to witness all of this.\n\nMaybe you haven't learned this lesson yet, but people would good intentions can still be awful in your personal life. Sarah and Derek, though they've made you feel at home and with friends, are pure drama (it seems). It makes no reasonable sense to encourage a 23 year old girl to go out with an older dude you're already dating. It's what kids in high school or college do when they're trying to believe everything can be cool if we're all just nice about it. In practice, you learn as you get older how ridiculously complicated that is and you can't just force your feelings to be one way or another because you want a certain situation to be true.\n\nSarah pushing you to give him a chance, him keeping from her what he was doing, him breaking up with you abruptly, Sarah inviting you around to \"confide\" the truth, Derek suddenly wanting to give it another go... drama and games. And they're pulling you into it. If you keep staying close with all of them, this Derek dating drama is going to be the main root of your relationships with them. It'll be the thing you always talk about and the main source of emotional confusion outside the relationships. This happened so many times when I was college.\n\nWhich is why I have a HUGE sideeye for 30 thirty year olds who engage in this nonsense. Most of us grow out or just get tired of that melodrama and opt for straight forward communication as we learn better ways to deal with interpersonal relationships. I'd put some distance in. Make new friends, search for a new space to hang out and avoid being a player in someone else's bullshit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Just reread Sarah is in her 50's? Run. A 50 year old woman encouraging this? No. There will be more drama piled on you and it won't be worth it.",
            "So... Sarah is a trash friend and despite people telling you to not get involved with either of these people and to walk away, you ran head on in. Sarah never cared about you and is playing you like a fiddle. Now you are saying \"probably wont learn anything\". You honestly need to seek some professional help because it sounds like a huge codependency issue.",

            "Are Sarah and her partner poly? Suddenly this story and how she\u2019s behaving make a lot more sense if so.",
            ">So Sarah apologized to me. She said she felt stupid and like a bad person, but that she had been feeling old and unattractive lately (she is 50). I told her that I wasn't upset with her at all, just shocked and that I was sorry I had been so oblivious to the real situation. \n\n\nShe is stupid and a bad person. Stop hanging out with her. Also why did you apologize to her? It is not your fault you were oblivious to a shitty situation. It might sound easier to just let it go but by sticking around these two, you're only setting yourself up for more of this. These people need to be cut off. Having no friends is better than having to deal with these two psychos. If you don't cut Sarah off what's to say she won't have another episode and try to make herself feel better by pulling another stunt. She is not to be trusted. Neither is Derek. \n\nStop putting yourself in situations that can easily be avoided. A cup of coffee is not worth the stress.\n\n",

I\u2019d say you need to tell her partner, except that you don\u2019t have evidence and the partner is likely not going to believe you, and cause you further problems. \n\nWhich seems odd, as this seems like a weird, close community so I\u2019m confused how they could even keep this secret. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you, you deserve better then that.

Okay let me get this straight, Sarah set you up with him while Sarah was in a long time relationship with the co owner, but she was also in a relationship with Derek?

I also get how a cafe can just click for you and not wanting to give it up.\n\nAs it currently stands, the drama is over if you let it be.\n\nTake a breath, put on your big girl panties and take a step back from these people.  I get not wanting to be alone for the holidays but things are progressing too fast with not just Derek but Sarah and her partner.  Now you know they aren't the friends they may appear.  So, keep it professional, polite and don't fool yourself twice.\n\nKeep reminding yourself you have only known these people for a short amount of time.  Tell yourself your safety and well-being comes first.  Don't let yourself mentally give them excuses or ruminate on the 'whys'.  Just say that 'they're not the kind of people I hoped' and move on.  Keep telling yourself you deserve better until it sinks in.\n\nOP, perhaps consider finding some meetup groups, try a few new hobbies, a group sport etc.  Maybe find some ex-pats in the area so you can speak your first language a bit.

And I want to be 100% faithful to my wife and this woman is NOT worth losing my family.\n\nSome posters said something may be missing from my marriage. and I thought about it and realized me and my wife don't spend that much time together.\n\nSo I talked to my wife about it I told her how I felt and what was on my mind and we had a heart to heart. We cried a little and I don't want to lose her we made a schedule and are going to work out date nights for us to spend more time together.\n\nAs for Talia.\n\nMe and her met up and I told her the honest truth I'm married and I don't want to do something I'll regret forever. I told her my feelings were getting a little to inappropriate and that maybe we should not talk outside of work.\n\nShe agreed and told me she started feeling the same and that we should limit contact. She said it's for the best and that I'm a good man because most men would have just let it continue but I didn't.\n\nSo we ended our friendship.\n\n\nIn the mean time I'm going to focus on my family and my wife and distract myself from thinking of Talia. Looking back it wouldn't have been worth it because my wife has been with me through everything.\n\nWhen I lost my job when my parents died when I needed surgery. She's had my children and sacrifices for them and takes care of them without asking for anything in return.\n\nAnd I'm happy with her and I couldn't replicate all those memories with any woman. She's the only one for me and I realized and appreciate all the things she does for me and our family.\n\nThat's the update and hopefully I'll never have to return to this sub-reddit again.\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: got my head out of my ass and realized how important my wife and family are to me. I ended my friendship with Talia and am going to focus on my wife and family now.",

Part of being committed and dedicated is to squash these things before they get out of hand.  It's going to happen, it's OK, it doesn't mean you aren't with your \"soulmate\".  Everyone has doubts, and human nature seems to want us to get out and not be tied down to one person.

            "I think you handled things well. I've seen it said a few times here and it's worth repeating. Everyone cheats for a reason. It's not always a good reason. It doesn't make it okay. It doesn't excuse what they did. But whether it's \"they're hotter than you\" \"I was drunk as fuck\" or \"we're just drifting apart and they were there to fill the void\", people have a reason when they cheat. This is important because you saw it coming up, and you've now realized the reason and are taking steps to fix it before something worse happens. And really, every once in a whole couples SHOULD take a step back and evaluate their relationship and make sure both partners are getting what they need out of the relationship. ",
            "There are good arguments for and against disclosing his feelings, it's a hard one. If it were me, I'd prefer that my partner didn't. But I can see how he's trying to be honest and move forward. \n\nThe bottom line for me though would be that he didn't act on his feelings, he decided to be honest and he's recommitted to our relationship. People are not perfect. I'd feel hurt and angry but I'd want to keep working on the relationship. \n\n\n\n\n ",
            "Dear OP, I think even realising your feelings and typing your original post needed great courage and strength from your part, and it's a pity that so many redditors readily set up an Inquisition and start judging so hard. It's only natural to feel these feelings and not everyone can so honestly and coherently arrange them and deal with them efficiently.\n\nIt's a loosing battle to compare something so fresh with daily routine. Because you're comparing the incomparable, the shallow and transient with the deeply rooted and timeless. You're lucky to have a wife who you are so close to and can share and understand each other at this level. ",

So now he is working with a woman who he is attracted to and who knows it and vice versa.  This is a ticking time bomb, and his wife has no idea this conversation took place.  This crosses the line to emotional cheating in my book.\n\n3) The right thing to do would have been to get another job or a transfer, then tell his wife the actual truth, that he was falling in love with a coworker so he requested a transfer.  \n\nI predict, and I hope I am wrong, that it is only a matter of time before he sleeps with this woman.",

Thank you all for your kind words, encouragement, and tough love \u2764\ufe0f also, I just realized my title is weird, (&amp;amp;) I think that\u2019s because I\u2019m on mobile and I copy/pasted the title from my previous post. Sorry about that! \n\n[original post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gq23vq/i_21_f_believe_my_boyfriend_32m_of_1_year_is/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) \n\nMy original post didn\u2019t get a lot of interest but there were a few people who asked for an update and I really just need to vent. \n\nThe night that I made my original post, Rick called me to tell me he was going to visit his brother who lives in a nearby city (Jolene also lives in this city). As soon as he called I knew what was going to happen but I kept my mouth shut because I wanted concrete proof. He was sharing his location with me &amp;amp;amp; I watched (and took screenshots of) him drive directly to her house, and stay there for 2.5 hours. I even texted my sister who lives about 20 min away from Jolene about it, and she drove there and took a video of his truck in her driveway. \n\nNeedless to say I was absolutely pissed. I cried to my mom about it, then went to his house and packed up all my stuff &amp;amp;amp; brought it to my parents place. Not long after I got back to their house he called me to tell me he was headed home. \n\nI asked him \u201cso are you going to tell me the truth about where you were tonight?\u201d \n\nHe acted oblivious, said \u201cI was just at my brothers, what are you talking about?\u201d\n\nWhen I said \u201cokay, if you\u2019re going to lie to me that\u2019s all I need to know\u201d he immediately started apologizing, saying he just went there for a visit, he just wanted to see her daughter, and he wasn\u2019t trying to hide anything from me.\n\nMy favourite part was \u201cif you would have asked I would have told you, all you had to do is ask!\u201d \n\nUmm, I JUST asked you, and you lied to me??? So he asked if I would come and talk to him in person the next day. \n\nThis is where Dumb Bitch Me \u2122 comes into play. \n\nI went the next day after work to talk to him. I asked him to be honest and tell me if he slept with her. He said no. We had a long conversation of him saying he fucked up but he didn\u2019t want to lose me, etc. etc. At the end of it basically we decided to still be together, but that it was going to take a lot for him to regain my trust. My one condition for him was to not talk to her, and if she did talk to him, or visa versa, I needed to know about it. I told him if that makes me a psycho bitch then he should just break up with me.\n\nSo for about 2 weeks we were still in a relationship but not spending near as much time together, saying I love you, or having sex. Basically it was like we \u201crestarted\u201d. HOWEVER during this time, she remained his best friend on Snapchat, and he continued to hide his phone from me. After two weeks I had gone to visit him, and we started talking about the situation. He was accusing me of cheating with someone to \u201cget back at him\u201d (with zero reason to believe this), saying he feels like he\u2019s walking on eggshells and that I don\u2019t trust him and he can\u2019t trust me. I asked him what he wanted to do about it because at this point I was so done with putting in all the effort.\n\nHe told me he wanted a break, and I told him I don\u2019t do breaks. So we decided for a week we would just have some time to ourselves, but the rules of a relationship would still apply.\n\nI left to go back to work, and that week he went and stayed the night at her house 3 times.\n\nThat week was so fucking hard for me, laying awake at night watching his location on my phone, knowing he was in bed with her. I barely wanted to exist, let alone go to work during the day.\n\nSo that weekend, I went to see him again and broke it off for good. I decided on my drive there that I was going to keep it simple and not blow up at him, so all I said was \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be together anymore\u201d. He hugged me, and his eyes got teary which was hard, but literally the next day him and Jolene were publicly dating, and still are.\n\nNow I\u2019m dealing with the aftermath of them turning certain friends against me as well. I\u2019m not sure what he says about me but I\u2019ve already had a few people \u201cunfriend\u201d and \u201cunfollow\u201d me. I guess I just don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s not blatantly obvious to these people that he cheated on me but oh well. I wish I could tell everyone the whole story, and show them all the screenshots, so everyone would see what they really did but I know that\u2019s not the right thing to do, and honestly it\u2019s not the kind of person I am. \n\nThe hardest part of this all has been the overwhelming feeling that I\u2019m not good enough. I have always struggled with my self esteem, but this has completely destroyed my confidence, and I feel utterly worthless. I can\u2019t get past the thought that I was just a placeholder for him until she wanted him again. \n\nTLDR: Rick went to see Jolene behind my back, I confronted him but we stayed together. He went and stayed the night at her house 3x so I broke up with him, now I am the bad guy and also Big Sad\u2122",

            "Those 'friends' who cut you out without hearing your side were never good people begin with.  Breakups are always hard but it does get easier and soon you'll find yourself stress-free from all the BS that came with having an idiot bf.\n\n\nSpend this time to love yourself and realise how amazing you are.",
            "One-day you'll find someone who loves you all if you and you'll look back laugh about this then never think of it again. It might be hard now but it'll get easier, he's 32 and acts like a 17 year old ...",
            "Him being an ass has nothing to do with you or your worth. Perhaps consider some counseling to help work on your self esteem. It can be helpful to have someone to talk to about those things. \n\nAnd there is no shade here, but please be extremely careful in the future about dating someone that much older than you until you\u2019re at least in your late 20s. Even then, proceed with caution. While not everyone in their 30s dating a decade+ younger is an abuser or a creep that is taking advantage of someone with less life experience and more patience for B.S., enough are that it\u2019s worth keeping your eye out for.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that things worked out this way, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve seen his true colors and dumped him without wasting any more time on a cheater. I hope you enjoy all the happiness in the world in the future.",
            "He\u2019s clearly taking advantage of you. I hope you get through this and find happiness. \u270c\ud83c\udffc",
            "Wow it's good that you threw out the whole man! You should be proud that you came out the other end of a shitty shitty relationship and that Jolene can continue dating a cheater. I went through a particularly crap break up which inevitably caused some division in my friend group (albeit not incredibly dramatic) but what made all the difference were the people I had as my support. I really relied on my closest friends/family in the months following the break up and I think that's what you need. People who cant see what he did was clearly wrong dont deserve your time and honestly blocking people online can really help you in terms of moving on (I did this myself 10/10 would recommend). Basically now it's time for you to look after yourself! You are worthy of love and you deserve everything! Take yourself on a nice date, buy yourself flowers, go out into nature, get involved in hobbies. You're living life without a dead weight on you anymore which makes you free to do whatever you want! Xx",
            "This is terrible. He sounds like a total loser. Hope you are alright.",
            "32 year old dating a 21 year old is 100% a loser",
            "How dumb do you have to be to cheat in your girlfriend while also sharing your location with her on your phone? I, for one, am happy that you\u2019re no longer dating a dictionary-definition **idiot**.",
            "Him cheating is not a reflection of you at ALL. \n\nHE is insecure and needs validation from other women, and it was easy to get from her.",
            "> I\u2019m not sure what he says about me but I\u2019ve already had a few people \u201cunfriend\u201d and \u201cunfollow\u201d me. \n\nHe already told you what he was going to tell them - that you revenge-cheated because you \u201ccrazily\u201d accused him of cheating with Jolene. When he accused *you* of cheating with zero evidence, he was test-running that story for the breakup he knew was coming. That\u2019s the narrative he\u2019s going with, I\u2019d bet my actual savings account. \n\nI don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to participate. But I\u2019d also remind you that defending yourself and telling the truth is not \u201cdramatic\u201d or unreasonable. If someone spreads lies about you, you have every right to clear your name. I do think starting a social media war is a bad idea, but if any of the friends who have unfollowed you are important to you, I see no harm in reaching out to ask them what they\u2019ve heard, and to give your side of the story if they\u2019ve been fed falsehoods. They might believe you, they might not, but at least you\u2019d know you tried.",
            "Dude you were dating a man 11 years older than you, and now he's turning your friend group against you? This must be the midwest..",
            "Look up Narcissistic personality disorder, triangulation  and smear campaign (he\u2019s smearing your reputation like he smeared his ex). Make yourself familiar with the disorder so you recognise the signs and don\u2019t attract another toxic personality type. \n\nJust be glad that you escaped before you were permanently entangled with this ass. His ex will be suffering soon just like you have been. \n\nAlso a word of warning, narcissists love trying to get back with their exes (as you know) so be careful he doesn\u2019t try and win you back just so he can do it all again.",
            "Go post them screenshots. it would have been fine if they just left you alone but if theyre going to turn the narrative they deserve to get the rug swept under them. Otherwise hope you find better people and friends to be around cuz breakups are hard yo. best of luck",
            "Just let it go. People know the truth, they aren't stupid. Its just that some people think cheating isn't a big deal and rather side with him. You don't need them.\n\nFrom your story, I pretty sure this guy was manipulating you the whole time. Why would a 32 y/o be dating a 21 y/o in the first place?",
            "I believe age gaps can work. I do not believe there is anything inherently wrong with an age gap in a relationship. But, in my experience, a 30 year old man looks for 20 year old women so that he can manipulate them. I feel like he took advantage of you. I'm sorry you went through that and I'm glad that you're out. \n\nThe Big Sad is rough. But please, if you can put it into perspective, know that you didn't lose anything of value. You truly didn't. You only gained from his departure in your life.",

            "[removed]",
            "V proud of you!!! I hope you are too. Just the fact that you didn\u2019t blow up on him says a lot. It\u2019s frustrating when someone fucks with your trust. But it\u2019s easier to just drop the loser and go be better off!",
            "I'm so so so sorry about this. You don't deserve any of this and I'm going to tell you something I wish id heard a lot sooner than 25 years old. You are enough. YOU ARE  ENOUGH. YOU ARE ENOUGH.\nYou are enough for you and absolutely no one else matters when talking about your self worth. I know it's tough now, but just remember that your self worth is defined by YOU. Not him, not your friends, not your parents. YOU. You define how you want to be treated and anyone who can't respect that should go.\nThink about those friends you call family im sure you think they're worth their weight in gold. I PROMISE they feel the same way about you & you deserve a partner who feels the same way.",
            "Hey, I'm a 21(f), if you need to talk about it, vent, or just need a friend to message, I'm here for you! \n\nYour ex sounds like trash, you sound like a trusting, empathic soul. Please don't think you're not good enough. Some people will think that the grass is greener, it won't take long before he realises it isn't \u2764\ufe0f",
            "He turned you into someone who feel the need to stalk your own boyfriend. That's not good, your trust is broken and there's nothing you nor him could do to change anything. I'm glad you've let go.",
            "YOU ARE 100% NOT THE BAD GUY, please understand this!!!!  \n\nYou\u2019re still so young and deserve so much better than a scumbag who can\u2019t give you his 100%. I promise you there is someone waiting out there, who will show you the love and affection you deserve. Time will mend your heart but please do not give him any more time and thought. You\u2019ve got this \ud83d\udc93",
            "You never had a chance with this guy. He still loved her, no matter how badly she treated him.  It was inevitable that he went back to her.  She\u2019ll likely slip again and mistreat him.  Just block him, drop his location finder, shut him off every way you can, and move on and find someone who treats you as his number one rather than \u201cgood enough for now\u201d.",
            "I don't get why you're not talking freely on social media about how hard it is to be cheated on.",
            "Girl, good for you. You broke up with this man in a very mature way when he deserved a lot worse. That speaks volumes about you. If there's anyone in this whole story with low self esteem, it's him. A respectable confident person never puts themselves in a situation to sneak around, hide, lie, cheat or abuse someone else's patience, trust and good will. And the fact that he was doing all of that at the age of 32 only shows you what a loser he is, and how \"far\" he's made it in life.\n\nAlso, don't let a bad experience with a messed up individual dictate how you're going to feel about yourself. In fact, work on building up your confidence and loving yourself after this experience. Assholes like him can smell the insecurity in other people, and they deliberately go for people with low self esteem because no one else would take their bullshit. \n\nYou deserve so much better, and you will find it, because you have your life ahead of you. The right people will always stay.",
            "He's manipulative. Those tears of his aren't for you, he doesn't care if he hurts you he just cares about serving his own needs and wants. I'm hopeful for your future love life that you're experiencing this harsh lesson at a young age, that you don't learn the hard way after a couple of decades spent in a vicious cycle with such a toxic person. Learn early how to spot a superficially charming, manipulative, unempathetic, gaslighting narcissist, how to read people for disingenuous versus genuine emotions (spot a liar better), and learn to trust your gut. Guys like this do tend to date younger than themselves by a significant age gap because they're too emotionally immature to have much success with women their own age (who, generally speaking, tend to be wiser to his brand of bullshit, though not always). Guys like him are emotional adolescents in the bodies of grown men. \n\nI'm curious: how old is Jolene, and when did *they* first get together?",
            "He\u2019ll do the same thing with her, once he gets the itch for the fun of sneaking around hits him again! Some people get off on the crap they put others through. Just find someone who deserves your time , he doesn\u2019t!",
            "1. He\u2019s a 30 something year old dating a 21 year old.\n\n2. Fuck the \u201cfriends.\u201d You honestly have more self-preservation than me. They weren\u2019t your friends to begin with. You\u2019re 21- you\u2019ll find better friends.\n\n3. If he cheated on you, he\u2019ll do it to her. \n\n4. You are so strong and have your whole freaking life ahead of you.\n\n5. If anyone\u2019s self-esteem should take a hit, it\u2019s his. Think of this as the universe giving you a lucky break-the trash took itself out.\n\n6. Cheating has nothing to do with how \u201cgood\u201d one is or how \u201cpretty\u201d one looks. Jay-Z cheated on Beyonce. Brad Pitt cheated on Angelina Jolie.\n\nCheating should only go to show how trash the cheater is. You are beautiful and capable and amazing!",
            "Why are you dating a 32 yo?  You\u2019re 21.  That\u2019s creepy.",
            "Geez, what a loser. Be proud that you left that clown, and dont even think you arent worth it, for someone else's poor judgement calls. And as for the woman he is dating, in what world does she live in, wherein she thinks he will be faithful to her? Anywho, that aside the point. Its hard to hear and even harder to do, but please just stand strong. You did nothing wrong, and you arent the baddie in this.",
            "Wow fuck him... fuck jolene too\nYou are twenty you're young let me tell you something in most cases theres no reason for your boyfriend to be so close to his ex.he will give you every excuse in the book.... they're friends.. he loves the kid.. fuck that. Any 32 yr old man with a girlfriend isnt friends with women. ESPECIALLY not a fucking ex.... he gaslit and took advantage because you're 20 and you didnt wanna look crazy... there was nothing normal about it. He was a coward to string you along\nLesson to take from this is: if your man is happy at home he has no reason to try to be friends with any of his ex's",
            "Omg you are more mature & have more integrity than he ever will. Jolene deserves him, WOULDN'T IT BE A SHAME? if he does the same to her.....",

            "He wants to build a stable of women that fulfill his individual needs without having to respect them as individuals.\n\nDoesn't really sound like a charmer.",
            "I felt this way too much. I\u2019ve been there. It was the worst breakup of my life. Because I NEVER felt closure. Because how can you ever say \u201cI feel fine that he cheated and lied about it. I feel fine that he made the rules to break them.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s been years and I\u2019m still dealing with the aftermath of having some confidence again.\n\nOne positive is it made me take ABSOLUTELY no shit from any man ever again.\n\nSo just know that you got this. It\u2019s gonna be hard, but you totally are going to get through it.\nYou\u2019re going to come out more aware from this. You\u2019re going to become so much stronger. And you\u2019re gonna kick the future\u2019s ass.\n\nI wish you all the best in your journey back to confidence. If you are able to, I would really recommend a few therapy sessions. Something like this is really hard to work out on your own.\n\nBest of luck to you! Also fuck fuckboys.\n\nAlso this is a grown ass man. What a gross motherfucker. Who, at 30 years old, gets a 21 year old, and then cheats on them. Like, bro you already scored what you wanted. You need another??? This guy is a pig af\n\n\nPs. You\u2019re so much more worth something than he is. You know the importance of a bond, of a commitment. You respect the rules. You tried to make it work. He was so spineless he had to lie. He was so worthless he needed two women at once because he feels so little about himself at 30. He knows he\u2019s garbage. Therefore he gotta act like trash.",
            "Girl, is it possible for you to get out of the small town? Because the world is so much bigger than 32 year old men who never grew up and a crowd of people who buy every word out of their mouths.\n\n\nI've stayed friends with my friends' exes over them on multiple occasions. If they didn't even hear you out then they're not worth your time.",
            "Your friends didn\u2019t cut you off. If a person can be turned against you without hearing your side, that person isn\u2019t a friend, nor is it someone you should want in your life.",
            "> I guess I just don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s not blatantly obvious to these people that he cheated on me but oh well. \n\nPeople who watch a 30 year old date a 20 year old don't care about the 20 year old. I'm  sorry you had to go through this OP.",
            "you are a saint. if anyone did that to me, i'd flip out. idk how you kept your cool facing him for the breakup because i would have torn him apart.\n\nanyone who chooses to cut someone out of their life over relationship drama without hearing both sides is usually an asshole by default. they're not real friends, nor healthy friendships.\n\nyou didn't deserve any of this. not a moment. you're better than all of them. keep your chin up queen.",
            "You should be proud of yourself! Him and his friends are trash.",
            "Took you a while and you put up with way too much, but it\u2019s good you ended it. \n\nI had to laugh at the dumb ass though, knowing his location was shared with you and then going to her place and then lying about it. \n\nLike others are saying, you\u2019re 21. You have so much time to have fun and party or whatever you feel like doing. Move to a big city and live it up. Enjoy yourself.",

            "Rick is a piece of shit, Jolene is a scummy woman, and you deserve better. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re enduring this. That\u2019s a terrible burden to bear, but know that it\u2019s a reflection of them and not of you.",
            "A relationship a) ended and restarted again and b) built on cheating and lies ain\u2019t gonna last anyway sis. In time you\u2019ll be grateful that the trash took itself out \ud83d\udc95",
            "Bad people crosses our paths, sometimes as bf, sometimes as fake friends. \n\nYou got rid of bad person, in my opinion. He was cheating on you, gaslighting, lying to your face. Clearly he doesn't respect you. The break up part is bad, but in time you'll realize that you are a good person that did all you could to try to save this unsaveable relationship. \n\nJust don't blame yourself. It's not your fault he's an a\\*. \n\nAlso, if those friends unfriended you without even hearing your side of it, I'm sorry but they are not real friends.",
            "I am so sorry that this has happened to you. I was married right after I turned 21 and had been dating him since I was 17. He was 4 years older than me. My X husband destroyed my life. He cheated on me with a girl who was a guest at our wedding. Someone who should of been a friend and this girl had people following me and threatening me for divorcing him after he cheated on me with her.(I had concrete evidence)\nThese feelings of not being good enough and being down on yourself will linger for awhile but you will get through it. The best advice I can give is to take this time for yourself and to be ok with being alone. Don't go out on dates or have sex with anyone. Your head is in a very fragile emotional state and you must rebuild yourself before moving on. \nWhen I was going through my divorce, I spiraled out of control and ended up in an abusive relationship for over two years; which led to severe PTSD and other mental/emotional issues. Don't let that be you. Take care of yourself. Get yourself good and don't worry about what these \"friends\" say. If they were your true friends then they would be by your side, supporting YOU.",
            "Omg count yourself lucky for getting away from this dude when you did. You\u2019ll be ok, you did the right thing. It does suck though. Cheating has nothing to do with the other person. Think about all the rich beautiful celebrities that get cheated on. It is a defect of him, not you!",
            "You will soon find that the relief of not feeling that anxiety and heartache while in that relationship far outweighs this current feeling of sadness. It will pass. Trust me, I have been through it. Stay strong, for YOU. You deserve so much more that what he was giving you. See this as a blessing because now, you have the opportunity for a brand new life! New man, new friends (:",
            "he played you and he played you hard. those were crocodile tears at the end, girl. learn from this never to give someone who does fuck all for you more than one chance.",
            "It\u2019s easy to fall into this trap when you\u2019re young that what a man thinks of you defines your self worth. A man wanting to have sex with you or date you does not make you inherently valuable. Think about women you really admire and look up to either in your life or in the media. What qualities do these women have? Do you think these women are valuable because of their marital status? Strive to be more like these women you admire. \n\nConfidence doesn\u2019t just materialize out of thin air, it comes from practicing regular self care and self improvement. Focus on your studies, career, friends, exercise - things that make you feel good and fulfilled.",

I had a giant group of friends, probably like 40+ homies that I\u2019d hang with on a weekly basis, I\u2019m 28 now... and you know how many of those friends I even talk to once a year?..... literally 1 of them, friends aren\u2019t at all what\u2019s it\u2019s cracked up to be, most of em will fuck you over anyway. Plus you\u2019re 21... enjoy life man. Go out, meet a guy that respects you, most importantly, don\u2019t loose hope and start being one of those people that are like \u201call guys are the same\u201d... cuz in the end. You gunna pass up a really good guy with that perspective. Aye. Good luck.",
            "I've been in a similar situation when I was around your age, dating someone about 10 years older thinking I was in love, but later found out I was only there to pass the time until he got back with his ex.  I know how horribly heartbreaking and hurtful it feels at the time but after a while, when you begin to love yourself again, find someone worthy of your love, meet some people worthy of your friendship, you'll look back and be like, \"yeah, I didn't really need him, anyway, but it was an experience.\"",
            "Fuck that cheating, lying, POS guy.  You deserve better.",
            "Next guy will need to prove himself to you. Don't give second chances and trust your gut. You've learned a lot from this relationship. Now cut it and everyone associated out of your life. Block them on social media and focus on you and the amazing life and goals you have ahead of you. \n\n*Have a mantra :* **\"This sucks now but it will get better\" \"I'm beautiful, I'm strong, I'm worthy, I can do this\" \"I can do hard things\" \"This is temporary\"** *Even if you don't believe it, it helps to hear it and say it until you do.*",

Girl the problem is not with you it is 100% with him. Sounds like this 32 y.o. man still doesn't know how to be mature and have a grown up relationship. I went through something similar and what really helped me was to just grieve (to get it out of my system), get angry (cause you're entitled to that), and it was after all of that where I picked up whatever was left of my self esteem and learned how to put my needs and feelings above others for once in my life. This was truly transformative and soon enough time faded that pain.  So anyways what I'm saying is that you should look after yourself, do what you want to, feel what you feel, and live your life. Your ex is going to be stuck in that cycle and perpetually unhappy but you will have moved on.",

You could have had all the power in this scenario with that one move.

You can do SO much better.",

The problem is not with you, it is with them.\n\nRick is not man enough to end one relationship before beginning another one.  Jolene apparently has such little self-worth that she is okay with be a side piece.  The friends who have dropped you are not friends.

            "OP, when I was cheated on I also took a huge hit to my self esteem and agonized for a long time about what I may have done to catalyze it, or what was \"inherently wrong\" with me.\n\nThe answer is ZILCH. Please remember that this guy is absolutely pathetic, pathetic and so is Jolene. Why on earth would she take back a guy who was essentially two-timing with a woman over 10 years his junior? Look up Narcissistic Personality Disorder (which someone already mentioned) and their actions might make a little more sense. I feel bad for her kid, who already idolizes a shitty dude and will have to grow up around their dysfunctional mess of a relationship and witness it implode in time.\n\nYou, on the other hand, have accrued some life experience which will make you stronger and more aware of red flags moving forward. What happened to you was very stressful and I suggest talking to a therapist to help rehabilitate your self-confidence moving forward (lord know that I wish I had!)",
            "Never take a cheater back. Leave the first time, scrape the sh*t off your shoes and move on. Taking back a man like this enables his behaviour.

Cheating is a character flaw.  \n\nLet her deal with his BS full time & take away the whole forbidden aspect of their friendship. And those so called friends ?  If they were real friends they\u2019d call you to hear your side of it. \n\nKeep your dignity, grieve the relationship but live your best life.  Be wary of the snap back - he\u2019ll come running back to you once things settle.",
            "You did the right thing by dumping him, and it\u2019s understandable you are hurt and sad. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, yet you were punished and hurt by the person you love. Add insult to injury, he\u2019s now with the person he was cheating on you with, and you\u2019ve realized that many of your friends aren\u2019t good friends at all. You really got the short end of the stick. \n\nIt will take some time to recover, and I encourage you to practice lots of self care and self love. You are not at fault. You ARE good enough.

Dont insult your real friends by lumping them in with that human trash.

But, with age and especially for a woman, you gain a certain wisdom with men as you get older. The first thing I would tell you is to try to date men around your own age. A significantly older guy has played the field with lots of women and knows how to manipulate them, especially younger ones. And there is a problem with older men that ONLY date significantly younger women. Women their own age see right through their bs and want nothing to do with them. So more than likely there is ALREADY some issue with a guy like that. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. You trusted him and still he lied to you. Don't feel worthless! He is just one guy. There are so many better men out there that are worthy of you. You my dear are not the problem. Just be careful that he doesn't come crawling back when she gets tired of his crap and plays with your feelings. X him and her and all their friends out of your life. You will be better for it.",

It will not work out with the ex and it could take weeks, months or years, but he will try. Block him on everything, and if you get a \u201cI miss you\u201d message even if he\u2019s still with his ex, delete and don\u2019t reply.

I went back to college. I was always athletic and fit, but I took it to a level that everyone thought I was 18. I built a career where I was very successful. Did things for myself financially that I never had before. Just knowing that I could do it all without help.... I was able to build myself back up! You can too.\n\nThe way you feel now is temporary. You weren\u2019t good enough? This guy sucks. This girl is now stuck with a cheater until he moves on to the next girl. You were too good for him. You\u2019ll find someone much better for you.

He and some of them definitely did some kind of smear campaign on me to a few other people I considered friends. The fact they believed it still galls me a bit, but my life is far better not wasting time on them and their fake ideas of friendship. It won't feel like it for a while, but this is an opportunity to improve the people around you.",

You go girl. You may feel like Dumb Bitch but in my book you rock.\n\nIn fact, this happened to me in both of my long-term relationships, so my advice would be to you to try to identify any red flags early your next go-around. I didn't. Nothing is wrong with you. I promise. These people are just really good at manipulating. Best thing I did was spend over a year single to rebuild myself.",

You are still young girl and he as 32 year old new exactly what he was doing. \n\n Trust me once a cheater always cheater, Joan will probably go through this soon too, not something I wish on my worst enemy, but she chose the lying man as someone trustful... watch it burn from distance and get someone better.

She didn't blow up, but as predicted, she didn't take responsibility either. But I've now done everything I can and can move on.\n\nNo one asked for this update, but I guess I wanted to give some of you \"told you so\" rights? I was able to use bits and pieces from almost every comment. From preparing myself for it to not go well/needing to hang up on her, to making sure I didn't fall into the trap of explaining/listing out past incidents. I basically said the following:\n\n\"I'm happy for \\[list of accomplishments she's had\\]. Unfortunately none of that erases 20+ years of lack of support and actions by you that clearly indicated I wasn't a priority. I'm not looking for explanations nor apologies. I've worked hard to make my peace with it, and I've worked hard to get our relationship to a point where I can maintain my mental health and have you in my life. So when you say it could be better, in my mind it's right where it needs to be. If that's to change at all, I have some boundaries that **need** to be followed: \\[list of boundaries, some specific but two big ones of *Respect my boundaries* and *Respect when I say 'No'*\\]. If you want us to talk more, I'm happy to pick up the phone. You have every right to ask things from me, but have to respect when the answer isn't what you want to hear.\"\n\nFirst question was if I thought our relationship was better before my stepdad came around - No.\n\nNext was asking for examples when she didn't support me. I told her she'd have to do some reflecting because she was there for the same events I was, and it's not fair to me to ask for that emotional labor. She said she had done \"lots\" of reflection and couldn't see it \"until \\[stepdad\\] came into the picture\". She pushed a couple more times for examples. \"Is it because I missed some events *your dad* was at?\" She stopped when I called her out the second time for deflecting responsibility for her actions. I told her multiple times during this portion that she doesn't have to remember/own up to anything, but she does have to live with the consequences.\n\nHer last question was, \"Is there any way we could ever push past this all?\" I told her this is what \"past this all\" looks like. She pushed back a little bit, but when it was clear that I wasn't moving an inch, the call ended with \"Well, thank you. You've given me a lot to think about.\"\n\n\n\nNone of her questions or responses were any indication she was worried that I was hurt. She was trying to find justifications I might listen to, anything to poke holes. There was part of me that wondered if she always recognized how much neglect there was and just didn't want to face it, but claiming \"lots\" of reflection and not having a single incident come to mind that didn't involve blaming someone else answered that question. While she was \"calm\" while she tried to respond, her tone was very tense. Worst case here she continues to try to push boundaries and I cut off contact and it's one less stress in life, best case she respects them and it's one less stress in my life (I know this is likely a case of she'll respect them until she doesn't). The important thing for me was that I was up front with her and set clear boundaries. I've done my due diligence to telling her how our relationship could \"change\" (I used \"change\" instead of \"improve\" very intentionally with my mother). I'm relieved. Ball's in her court and I have some answers. Thanks again for the advice, sharing of your own experiences, and encouragement. It gave me the confidence and a plan for that phone call.\n\nEdit: some typos\n\nEdit 2: I'm relatively new to posting on Reddit so forgive any etiquette missteps please. First, thank you to the kind strangers for the awards! My first. Second, thank you to everyone that commented. I'm both happy and saddened that I'm not alone. I appreciate the perspectives that everyone brought; it gave me some new things to consider. Third, thank you for the recommendations for groups, books, resources! I fully recognize this is just one step in a lot to finding peace and have some reading to do. Good luck to everyone who's going through something similar, whether it's family or friends.

I know she will not take kindly to my detachment and will respond with self righteous rage - the knot I know so well was tightening in my stomach.  \n\nAnd then I read your post and it was an injection of hope.  Like some cosmic best friend  reminded me that we already know what we need and how to maintain it for ourselves.  And that I'm not alone with my crappy mom and the baggage she's given me, nor am I alone in the pursuit of health.  I didn't know I needed all that until you gave it to me.\n\nThank you.",
            "I just want to say - I read your first post and it sounded so much like my own mother and I. My mom is also an addict (drugs and alcohol) and we\u2019ve never had a relationship. She was emotionally abusive and borderline physically abusive and also had a string of very violent boyfriends. She was diagnosed with cancer ~12 years ago and thought that would absolve her of all wrongdoing and we\u2019d have an instantly perfect relationship \u201cbecause she\u2019s dying and doesn\u2019t have much time left.\u201d She even had a similar blow up at me because I sent her a text last year on Mother\u2019s Day and didn\u2019t call. She even pulled the same line: \u201cWell, I\u2019m your mother, so you should call *me*.\u201d\n\nI only talk to my mom about four times a year. I don\u2019t think I could tolerate speaking to her more often than that. I know this hurts her, but it\u2019s what\u2019s best for me after being subjected to all of her shit growing up.\n\nEven though I know it\u2019s best, I do still feel a lot of guilt sometimes for \u201cdenying\u201d her a better relationship. I just wanted to say I\u2019m really happy you were able to advocate for yourself and your needs. It\u2019s really, really hard.",
            "Your mom is going to have to do a lot of work to ever get to the point where she can even recognize that her past (and present) behaviors were toxic and destructive. When people have self-defense mechanisms in place, they often see their associated behavior as positive or benign. She likely cannot remember what she did because her judgment at the time was so clouded. Many times, I've only been able to change my behavior when I see someone else doing something I hate and then it clicks for me that I do that too. \n\nSometimes too much damage has been done and sorry just doesn't make a difference. Sounds like you're in a good emotional place. If your mom had experienced any real emotional growth, she'd be proud of you for your boundaries instead of annoyed that you won't be her emotional crutch.",
            "Please check out /r/raisedbynarcissists and even better, /r/raisedbyborderlines - they've helped me a lot.",
            "Children always want to have a relationship with their parents, even when the parents have abused them emotionally, physically, or spiritually. We, as children of abusive parents say things like, when they get older, they will realise what they have done and they will be sorry and want to apologise and make up for it. I am sorry, but this is rarely the case. \n\nRight now, you still want that relationship with your mother, and your are bending over backwards, still trying to make it happen. It is great that you are giving her limits and boundaries, but you are still hoping when she is giving you clear signs that objective others can notice [I suppose, like me], she is not going to change - she is not taking responsibility, she does not see a problem in her behaviour, is trying to make you do the work [she is asking you to give examples of her behaviour when she knows full well what they are]. By saying the ball is in her court, you are still hoping, and you are not looking at the whole picture - you want the happy ending that will never happen. \n\nThe reason I say this is from experience. My mother [I rarely use this term anymore] is a narcissist. She did everything your mother did and maybe more. I kept telling myself, she would change, because I dearly wanted it to happen. I wanted a mother that cared. I thought that with time, she would mature, have insight into her emotionally stunted behaviour. I believed she would take responsibility for the nasty things she did - take responsibility and blame for the things that she did to the family and other people, but it never happened, no matter how many times we talked, negotiated, set boundaries, or whatever. She would always revert back to \"I don't know what you mean\", or \"your are being unfair to me\" or \"I didn't say that\", when all those things happened. Your mom is an emotional child who will probably never take responsibility for her behaviour, and you have to prepare yourself for that. You need to make a line in the sand where you say, \"this is enough, I will no longer do this anymore. I have given her enough chances\".\n\nI finally went non-contact. All I can say is I wish I did it years earlier. It is such a relief not having her in my life. I came to terms that she will never take responsibility for her behaviour because she is just a 3 year old in an adult body.",

Reading your words was like a description of my relationship with my own mom in many ways and I'm not sure I'd have been able to do so well as you did (I don't have conversations like this with mine... Avoid avoid avoid is my strategy). I'm proud of you. That could not have been easy to articulate/hear/stay composed for, but you did it. Wow.",
            "Congrats on setting boundaries.\nMy grandma doesn\u2019t respect boundaries and has done some less than ideal things she refuses to acknowledge. But my mom doesn\u2019t want to completely loose her from her life so they talk once a week on Sunday. And there are a couple of topics my mom refuses to talk about. She\u2019ll tell her mom to stop talking about it once and if she continues will normally  just say she has to go now. If her mom calls on a different day she normally won\u2019t answer the call and will text her that they\u2019ll talk on sunday. \nIt\u2019s not ideal and she doesn\u2019t always have fun on the calls but it\u2019s what she decided she could handle.  Keep up the firm boundaries and good job having the hard conversation and holding your ground!",
            "Well done! I had this talk with my mum January this year, and it sucks so I can empathise with you. Well done on taking that big step. Good luck with the enforcing of your boundaries going forwards (as I can imagine she will try to hoover you back to her in a month or so' time).",
            "This is such a great example of having and keeping boundaries. You did amazing OP! You should be proud of yourself! :)",
            "Very well done to you, op. I did a similar thing last year with a family member. Unsurprisingly, I don\u2019t here from them anymore.",
            "Hi OP! I remember your last post, and can I just say I\u2019m proud of how well you managed the conversation? You redirected when needed and didn\u2019t let your mom take over the conservation it seems. \n\nIt can be so difficult to set boundaries with parents, but is very important when it involves a parent that tends to have narcissistic tendencies. I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t blow up, and that you were able to confront her in a good way. \n\nSending you good energy and well wishes, stay strong and firm in your boundaries. You are valued and cared for!",
            "I was going to say that maybe she actually had no idea what she did wrong but almost anyone might at least guess that their selfish, alcoholic behavior could cause problems.\n\nIt sounds like you're doing exactly the right thing for your own health and wellbeing.",
            "Eventually, I'm going to have to tell my parents that I went no contact with my abusive sister (so holidays will look different).  My parents enabled a lot of that abuse, and it has strained our relationship.  The way you handled that discussion with your mom is amazing, and I've read this twice and saved this post so that when I'm ready/have to have that conversation, I can hopefully remember the maturity and grace you showed.",
            "It sounds like you did everything just right while prioritizing protecting yourself. I've recently tried several times to reach out to my mother to repair our relationship (which she broke) only to have to accept the truth: she doesn't care enough about me to take accountability for her actions. I can't forgive her until she admits everything she did and didn't do and actually asks for forgiveness. So that leaves us at an impasse. I think every woman wishes she could have that Lorelai and Rory relationship with her mother but the sad truth is that a lot of mothers simply aren't capable of that.\n\nI'm trying not to take it too personally. My mother is a psychologically damaged individual and her behavior is a coping mechanism. I actually feel really bad for her because she's never going to be honest with herself and is never going to do the work required to heal mentally. She's not a happy person and she probably never will be.\n\nAt least now, having gone through all this with her, I know what to do and what not to do when I hopefully become a mother myself some day.",
            "Very proud of you for standing your ground! It sounds like your mom is very emotionally immature. I would highly recommend the book \u201cThe Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents\u201d By Lindsay C. Gibson. I\u2019ve been reading it lately and it\u2019s changed my life. It\u2019s made me feel seen and given me strategies on how to maintain my mental health while having my parents in my life.",
            "Well done its tough when it is family. Our boundaries are often blurred.\n\nMy only comment is that sometimes our memories play tricks on us. It is proven that we remember things differently to how they happened and can often leave the things out that made us feel bad or we didn't want to remember. \n\nI have had a similar situation to yours with my dad and he didn't know any of the events that pained me so much when we had our chat. This bothered me as it caused me so much pain, how could he not remember?! \n\nSo i told him and he didn't have a clue as to these events. They were so etched in my brain but not his so Sometimes I think its OK to say 'like X or Like Y'. In your original post you mentioned she was an alcoholic and that may have altered her perception with it all or had a different perspective. \n\nEither way you did great and Good luck OP \ud83d\udc4d",

            "Wait... do we have the same mom?",
            "Can I just say you are great at explaining. The amount of details here is the first time I think I would be able to offer truly sound advice on a situation. Too bad you know what you\u2019re doing already (I guess that\u2019s a good thing though).",
            "Well done! I am so impressed with how you handled this and your emotional intelligence. I tried to have a somewhat similar conversation with my mother last year, but it didn't go this smoothly and we are now no contact, yet she still keeps pushing boundaries (e.g. going behind my back to find my address after I refused to give it to her). I'm saving your post just in case she comes back and I end up needing to have this conversation again. \n\nFrom your last post: \"trust her to be my mom - works for like 6 months - get blown up at because I don't want to take her recommendation for a trash can\", ***I felt that***. I was planning a wedding at the time, so there were a  lot of trash cans for her to have opinions on.",
            "You handled this magnificently. I really admire that. I wanted to thank you, oddly, because I struggle in a very similar manner with my own mom. I often feel very confused and hurt, with little knowledge on how to handle situations in a way that is fair to myself. The amount of maturity and self-respect you displayed is incredible\u2014and must have taken a lot of work, as it shouldn\u2019t have been your job in the first place to advocate for yourself to this extent, as she is *supposed* to be the parent. Either way, I\u2019m sure you know all of this. I just wanted to thank you, because I feel I am somewhere along the journey you have been on for years, and reading your posts helped me feel lot less alone and a lot more valid.",
            "First, this post was so helpful as an example of boundary setting. Thank you for laying out what you said, it was perfect. Second, I personally think your mom did better than many people would in listening to you, but most people don't change as quickly as your mother thinks she has. Hopefully this may bring some perspective to her perceived change, because as you pointed out, her reactions show she hasn't fully grasped the impact of her choices. She may need some time to process what you told her and learn from it, or she could continue to sweep it all under the rug in hopes you'll \"get over it\". I really hope it's the former, of course! \n\nEither way, you did wonderfully--it was healthy, strong, and empathetic. Thank you for the update!",
            "I\u2019m going to save this post because it is so well articulated, I could use so much of this if my mother ever cornered me into a conversation like this. Thank you and best of luck to you!",
            "Wow! You did an incredible job! Thank you for writing this all out. \n\nI\u2019m well past this stage with my parents, but it took me years and several attempts to be able to articulate my boundaries as concisely as you have.",
            "Proud of you! I did something very similar with my mother and was so afraid, I recorded the phone call. She went as far as to say I was sexually abused by my stepfather because I \u201cwas a difficult child\u201d, I put up a thousand walls between us and two years later she called me.\n\nShe has grown, completely owned up to all the abuse and her wrongdoings and what she wishes she had done. She cried, apologized. \n\nI\u2019m not saying this will happen to you too, but know that I didn\u2019t feel an ounce better, in fact I just felt worse because I new empathy for her and all the abuse she endured from both family and her husbands. I have found peace in knowing she will not continue to abuse my kid brothers, and proud that she is also trying to confront her mother (my maternal grandma) about the trauma she caused her.",

            "I feel like this is a complicated one. Drinking is often something people turn to out of desperation and trauma. It hurts the people around you, but it's a sickness too.\n\nShe's probably in serious turmoil inside and while it's not your job to fix her, and likely no-one can, it sounds like she's doing some serious personal work. She's given up drinking, she's dealing with realising that the love of her life is a jerk and that must be painful, and she's trying to repair things.\n\nMy mum apologised to me for a lot that happened in my childhood and that felt good but I'd realised long before that she was human, she'd had a shitty childhood herself and she was doing her best with the tools she had. She's now a fantastic grandmother but it didn't happen overnight to be who she is today, and honestly even tho she wasn't a great mum, she's always been a person I admire and who I got a lot of who I am today from.\n\nSounds like your mum is getting older, doing some personal work and trying to be a better person now. She loves you in the best way you can. Set boundaries so that this relationship doesn't hurt you, but maybe rejecting her is too much. Don't hold out too much hope that it's going to be sunshine and lollipops, but try letting it be a bit more than it is now.",

YES. I\u2019m glad to hear you stick to your guns and held those boundaries. It can be so hard.",
            "Your mom sounds a lot like mine. I had to set boundaries a few months ago and it was the hardest thing ever. I have been in therapy for almost two years now due to the impact my mom\u2019s behaviour. I was diagnosed with CPTSD and an anxiety disorder thanks in part to her shit parenting, histrionics and (clinically diagnosed) bipolar disorder. \n\nYou\u2019re doing the work to keep yourself safe and to heal yourself. It is hard but it is so essential for happiness in your own life. I liken reckoning with your abusive parent to taking on the big boss at the end of the video game: you can work on yourself only so far before you have to face the big boss and level up. Establishing boundaries with my mom was a huge breakthrough in healing my anxiety and being happy and functional in my other close relationships, even my marriage. \n\nI hope you soon begin to experience the benefits as well. I truly believe that when you grow up with no boundaries it becomes delightful to assert yourself and you can just keep going because it feels so good. Blowback is inevitable with these types of people, especially if she\u2019s just waiting you out as others pointed out. Prepare yourself for it, and stand your ground. From reading both your posts, I don\u2019t think your mom *can* actually understand how she hurt you, and she could never make amends with you in a way that could heal you. It sounds like you accept that, and the next step is giving yourself permission to grieve that relationship you deserved as a child and never received. Be kind to yourself, and know that everyone is worthy of love and respect just as they are.",

            "This was beautiful to read. Thank you for updating.",
            "You handled this very well. Was compassionate to your mother's situation, held true to what you were comfortable with and valued your feelings and politely, logically and fairly expressed yourself, your needs for a change in the relationship without shitting on her and getting caught up in emotions and the past.\nSo awesome. You did your research, thought carefully about everything and did what you thought was right. Really awesome. Hope things keep going well!",
            "First of all, mad props to you for standing up to your mother and sticking to your guns.  I (50M) have had numerous such calls with my father (75M), and they are excruciating.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with your mother's behavior in trying to push her agenda on you is her complete and utter lack of understanding of the 9th step.  Making amends is not a \"blanket\" apology, as you so eloquently put it.  An apology, several apologies, many apologies, these are just the beginning of the amend.  The purpose is to acknowledge specific incidents and freely admit responsibility with in intention of changing one's behavior.  It is, above all, an act of *humility*. \n\nIt doesn't sound like your mother does humility any better than my dad does.  Many times I have had to tell him to go back and do the 9th step, because completing this step once does not absolve the alcoholic from future transgressions either.  It's not a \"Get Out of Jail Free\" card forever, even if it is done right the first time.\n\nIt occurs to me that maybe your mother is not in a 12-step program.  If that is the case, then the chances that your mother will be able to rebuild her relationship with are nil.  If she is in a program, she needs to complete the 9th step.  I'd tell my dad to read it to me, which pissed him off, but it prevents him from weaseling out of his responsibility.  Making an amend I'd not simply an apology, and certainly not a vague, all-encompassing blanket apology.  Until your mother can make amends, she cannot complete the 9th step, to say nothing of the remaining three.  If she cannot complete the program, she will be incapable of having the type of relationship she wants with you, and you seem rightly unwilling to move forward without her accepting her responsibility.\n\nArmed with this information, you can now state you case with crystalline clarity.  She completes the 9th step, and then the rest of the program, or she is done.  If she does it correctly, those acknowledgements of her behavior must be accompanied by *her* making statements of how *she* will behave differently, *her* asking what *she* can do differently.\n\nA quick example: \"I apologize for not respecting your boundaries with regard to calling at 6:00 am. I would like to amend. What is the earliest time I am allowed to call, and under what circumstances may I call earlier?\". This kind of language is really gonna stick in her craw, language like, \"what am I allowed\" and \"may I\".  It means giving up control and becoming vulnerable.  It's terrifying, and on some level I sympathize with your mother, as I do with my father, but I don't tolerate his bullshit.\n\nThe kicker is that I am a clinical social worker, and I've worked with hundreds of substance abusers.   It is much more difficult when it is someone you love, and that person has hurt you so deeply.  I would be remiss if I did not make that suggestion that you talk to a professional about your feelings so that you are not facing this on your own.\n\nI apologize for this being so long, and I truly hope that you are able to gain some reinforcement and insight from my past experiences.  If there is anything I can do to help, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nGood luck and take care.",
            "This is a perfect example of lack of emotional maturity (your mom). She is making this entirely about her and unfortunately is probably not even aware of it, as most aren't. You did really well! I hope for her own sake she will reflect and become more self aware.",
            "Holy shit you and I might have the same mother.",
            "Hey /u/ElFriday, I only just read your first post and after reading the first paragraph or so, and I thought you were me. \n\nMy mother is an alcoholic, she's narcissistic, she's rude and abusive. She has the worst taste in men, and also Golden Child'ed my half-brother. She made next to no effort with me, unless it somehow benefitted her, and for the most part I had to learn to completely cut her off from me emotionally. \n\nHowever, it wasn't until last year I actually went fully no-contact. I'd tried boundaries, I'd tried calling her out on her bullshit, but ultimately she decided that making me her scapegoat for her poor and frankly shitty life choices was more important than trying to maintain the low-level relationship we had. \n\nIt's hard, and especially when you're brought up to be told how terrible of a daughter you are, how selfish and uncaring you are. How rude and disrespectful you are for asking for the basics. It's really fucking hard, the guilt initially made me feel the worst. But I can honestly say that one year on of no contact I am much happier. I still sometimes get those pangs of guilt when she tries to text me, or when she tries to use the rest of the family against me, but honestly, finally giving myself the power to shut her down and take her out of the life has allowed me to give me the power to reflect and understand how much she has hurt me. With recognising the hurt comes the process of healing. \n\nI really hope you're able to achieve what you want with your relationship with her. All I wanted to say though that despite what she and others will say, you're not horrible, awful, or selfish. You, we, well we deserve better, and sometimes that is the form of absolute silence from the mother's who have hurt us.\n\nFeel free to message if you ever want to chat, and good luck. \u2665\ufe0f",

I told her she'd have to do some reflecting because she was there for the same events I was, and it's not fair to me to ask for that emotional labor.\n\nIf you don't mind, I'm stealing this for my conversation with my mother!

Tell them that at least your brother still has a chance to make up with his son one day in the future; it's difficult to do that if the kid is buried six feet under.\n\n For proof you can google some cases of kids who died from dehydration while practicing sports, there are several but this sub won't let me link them.",
            "Your niece is very brave. You can't change what your family think, no matter how wrong it is. Just make sure you let your niece and nephew know that you are proud of them and on their side.

            "Well, it must be depressing to have the mouse you're torturing taken away from you, but really, he has nobody to blame but himself.  This whole idea that the person who tells is somehow responsible is ridiculous.  If brother had been a good parent, it wouldn't have mattered what niece said.\n\nPersonally, I have cut family members who acted like that out of my life, and it was the best thing I could have done.  I would recommend to you, and your niece and nephew, that anyone who is standing up for his abusive dad is someone that they shouldn't spend time with.  It says a lot about them that they are more concerned about the abuser than the victim.",
            "A \"traitor\"? Your family is talking like their 10 year olds. She did the right thing. Unfortunately sometimes you can't change the minds of unreasonable people. \n\nTake comfort in knowing who in your family you can rely in in the future.",
            "It looks like your nephew and niece now have a much smaller family of origin now. \n\nKeep in constant touch with them. Remind them both that your niece probably saved her brother's life and that they're both great kids. Tell them that anybody, no matter who, needs to be strong enough to face the truth about themselves. Tell them that people who cannot face the wrong that they do are weak. \n\nJust stay in touch, because those kids will need all the love, support, and validation that they're not getting from their family.

            "Firstly, your brother should be able, through therapy and work, get a chance to see his kids again. He needs to do both. I've seen a lot of stupidity in he name of \"pushing\" gifted athletes. It's done out of ignorance, not evil. You need to talk to your brother and he needs to be the one to end this \"traitor\" nonsense. Next, he needs to take responsibility for his actions and start to fix himself. \n\nI would suggest he gets therapy, and start meeting with some real athletes in FCA or a coaching organization, so he can understand how real athletes are made. Once he's made the effort, he will be able to approach his kids and the police. \n\nHe has to be the one.",
            "All you can do really is support your niece and nephew. She did right, and as well as you know your brother is a scumbag and he shouldn't be anywhere near children. \n\nIt sucks having a family who will stick up for an abuser, but that's not on you.

Maybe he ought to enter a program or see a psychiatrist who can awaken within him a sense of responsibility and remorse. Are your family members unhappy the two were brought somewhere where they can be raised safely? Maybe they need therapy as well. I'd suggest all of those things, just that way, and if they don't like it -that's just too bad. ",

It'll probably make your life easier not having to put up with them.",

            "Hearing how the family is sympathizing with the abusive father reminds me of how people sympathized with that woman who murdered like 11 of her children to collect on their insurance. Mary Ann Cotton, I think. Her trial was delayed due to her being once again pregnant, and she put on a great show of nursing the baby and crying when the child was taken from her that some people began to say how cruel it was to remove a baby from its mother. They seemed to have completely forgotten that this is the same woman who literally murdered every one of her own kids, and nearly every child under her care. People are so easily swayed when they don't really care. These people are feeling sorry for the father because they're easily swayed.",
