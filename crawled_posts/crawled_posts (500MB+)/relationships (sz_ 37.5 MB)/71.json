        "selftext": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/46vjbn/i29m_broke_my_wife28fs_heart_how_do_i_save_my/\n\nI had forgotten about this post and I am back to update so maybe seeing my stupidity could prevent someone else from making the same mistakes.\n I cringe when I read today what I wrote months ago and it seems ridiculous to me that I could have felt this way about another woman. I wrote that I would imagine my former coworker while lying in bed but in the end when my wife stopped acknowledging my existence waking up without seeing her face was just absolute torture. I really took all I had for granted until I almost lost it\n\nSo I took some of the advices and decided to court my wife again the hardest I could. Of course the first step was looking for another job, and it took me a month but I managed to find a similar position in another entreprise. I did what was suggested of taking over every chore and she stopped ignoring me but would simply stare at me with some kind of hostility and go on with her life. I tried flowers but she would leave them to die. My wife dominant love language is physical but I wouldn't dare try touching her so I went for telling her. I somehow realized it was really the content of what I wrote about the other woman which obviously when you are deep in a crush is amplified, that really hurt her. I tried engaging her in conversations so we could talk about what was happening to us but more importantly what I did to her but she remained closed off. And so I started writing her letters and would leave them under her pillow.\n\n At first I apologized for everything, for writing the post, for not putting an end to the crush faster, for making her feel like another woman could hold a higher place of importance to me and for not taking the initiative to change jobs earlier. For making her life hard by creating this situation which ended in her sleeping in the guest room of her own house, for making her cry and causing stress to her. \n\nThen I wrote her love letters telling her how much I loved her, how the crush couldn't compare to the deep love I have for her. I was chewed for saying I loved her because of our history in my last post but I was misunderstood. I meant that the love I have for her has gotten stronger with time. 5 years ago I loved her, but wouldn't have given her one of my organs if she needed for example while now I would without hesitation. Our history is what caused the attachement to grow stronger therefore no random crush could override that. I was awed in front of my crush and wrote sappy things about her but in the end I do not know this woman on a personal level while I have seen the worst of my wife and the love remains. \n\nI told her how beautiful she was and how impressed and proud I was with her development as a person since we have met, how grateful I was for her presence in my life and every single thing I was thankful for that she did and enhanced my life, how much I needed her and missed hearing her tell me how her day went, laugh at my bad jokes and basically just missed hearing the sound of her voice. This is a small sample but it must have taken a good 3 weeks of daily letters until she answered me back.\n\nShe answered with a letter of her own telling me how much I have hurt her with my crush, how I made her feel invisible next to that woman, how I never told her such loving words (until the letters) how much she hated me but also how she loved me and missed me too. Her letter allowed me to feel her vulnerability. After reading it I cried and went to see her, we locked eyes,she cried and we held each other for a long time. She started talking to me again then and softened. Honestly the possibility of the marriage ending just like that scared the both us. \n\nAs of today we are, to my surprise, mostly back to normal and actually I feel closer to her. We continue with the letters which have helped increasing our emotional intimacy. I make an effort to tell and show her my love. I am very grateful that she has given me a second chance and even more so that she has decided to put the crush behind us. We had maybe 2  fights since but she hasn't brought it up and doesn't punish me. It really wasn't the crush on itself but how I went about it and the lack of affection from my part in comparison.\n Maybe I am being optimistic here but I truly think we are going to get through this. We will be going to couple counselling after our vacation just to make sure things are really settled between us.\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: I managed to get my wife back after working on the way I conveyed love to her and we are doing alright.",

If I found out my SO was infatuated with someone else I would be extremely hurt. But all you are guilty of is having natural feelings of attraction for someone else, and reaching out to a community you trust about those feelings. Your wife is entitled to her reaction, and I don't judge her for it, but you are also entitled to your feelings. And if those feelings include attraction to someone else then that's not something you have to feel guilty about. Acting on those feelings by pursuing a relationship with this other woman would have been a betrayal, but you didn't do that. You felt attraction beyond your control, and wrote about it. Why is that something you should feel guilty about in and of itself? The expectation this community put on you to leave your job and beat yourself up even more than your wife already was made me feel angry on your behalf. Are we all so insecure that we demand people who are feeling natural, healthy feelings to flagelate themselves?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm happy for you that you have saved your marriage, and I wish you and your wife the best. I just also wish this community would have taken a more compassionate angle with its advice. I would have told you to do everything it takes to save your marriage, because that is what you want, but you are married, not dead. In all likelihood you will feel attraction to another woman again (and your wife will feel attracted to other men). And when that happens just realize your brain is doing what it is designed for, and that's okay. Celebrate it as a sign of being alive! Then take that awakened energy and invest it back into your marriage.",

They \u201cgot on\u201d, exchanged numbers (he didn\u2019t offer that, i had to ask). The million dollar rhetorical question: Did this happen while we were together? \u201cYes. Am I not allowed to get on with people?\u201d I left the room.\n\nMy mother works for a law firm and has sent me the names of immigration lawyers. I\u2019m processing everything I need to do before I make an emotional decision and potentially screw something up. The kindness-and humor- have been stabilizing and have genuinely kept my knees from shaking.

Honestly, it was a weird transition going from long distance to suddenly living together and married, but I figured that was something we\u2019d navigate together.\n\n\nThe last few months, I noticed  a change in his Whatsapp activity- constantly online, last seen time stamps at really early hours in the morning...combined with zero sex, zero touching, barely any talking,I tortured myself over what could be going on.\n\nLong story short: I confronted him about it, even used the name of the girl he was talking to (my friend was holding my husband\u2019s phone when a message from her showed up) and he denied denied denied.\n\nTonight, for absolutely no reason whatsoever, I decided to scroll through Venmo feed. Seriously I was just vegging out and scrolling.\nSaw my husband\u2019s name, and transfer to the girl\u2019s name with the title \u201cDamsel in Distress.\u201d \n \nConfronted him. Then he told me he\u2019s having doubts about this, about us. I do understand how difficult it has been to move from London to a suburb, but my empathy stops there. The lies continued.\n\nTells me he booked a trip to Denver last Thursday to see \u201ca mate\u201d. I look up the girl on Facebook, what do you know, she lives in Denver. He then admits he was going to see her while he was there. The ease with which he lies is unnerving...\n\nSo here I am. He wants to work things out. I don\u2019t.I don\u2019t trust he won\u2019t come back from Denver in July and tell me it\u2019s over, and here I was, waiting for him and twiddling my thumbs. He\u2019s controlling the situation, and my trust in him is gone. I want to tell him to either leave now, or plan to relocate to Denver bc he clearly has intentions.\n\nHow do I approach this? His \u201cI want to try to fix this\u201d rings hollow and leaves me open to be stomped on at his will.\n\nTL;DR: Husband has been talking to another girl, lied about it, cites difficulty adjusting here, has flights booked to go and see her, and only told me because I pushed.\n",

            "Your story unfortunately speaks to one of the most devastating and real possibilities within any intimate, adult relationship, and that is the fact that in your husband's doubts or \"adjusting to life with you\" he showed you who he truly was. In doing so, he also revealed the manner in which he forms/sheds attachments to the opposite sex. As you mentioned, you acknowledged within yourself that going from long distance to all of sudden constantly having to be around someone and stimulate them within the confines of a marriage daily was an arduous transition. That's difficult for anyone, no matter how solid of a foundation the relationship was built upon prior to the move to be together. However, despite that, you never expressed or engaged in any lecherous behavior/acts that would even remotely jeopardize your relationship with him. Unfortunately, he did and there's the crux of the issue and I'm sure what's hurting you the most. You were committed to the commitment and all that entails, while he was merely committed to the idea of you (evident in the fact that once you two were married and genuinely together physically, he began to secretly, mentally and emotionally, long for something/someone else). I genuinely applaud you for understanding what empty, hollow verbiage \"I want to try and fix this\" is. It's not dissimilar to someone purposefully breaking a precious item in your home and then lackadaisically declaring with no contrition \"hey, I want to try and fix that if I can.\" It could have been avoided had you respected my home and maneuvered through it carefully with full awareness and precision. My point is, this could have been avoided because he moved to you to be with you, not vice-versa so he should've honestly and genuinely ruminated on precisely what that meant.

He doesn\u2019t seem to feel guilty about what he\u2019s done. You married him when you couldn\u2019t know everything about him, so don\u2019t feel bad that you didn\u2019t see some parts of his personality.  \n\nI hope you will take right decision for yourself.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nElisa",

But Had said she would still be able to pay rent with her residual income. The time came and she was late. And only paid a third of what she needed to.\n\nWell I can\u2019t move right now. Luckily my name is primary on the lease. And She is legally subletting with me. I went over a new lease agreement. And it has a weekly amount she has to pay me to catch up on rent and continue paying rent.\n\nIf she preaches this contract in accordance with my state law. She will be evicted. She refuses to talk to me. She refuses to leave her room. I told her that I don\u2019t hate her and I still deeply care about her. But she has to pay or else she has to leave and I\u2019ll find someone else to rent the second bedroom.\n\nThe place we rented have rooms for each of us so that we could have a private space as well as time with each other. If she\u2019s not able to pay I\u2019m planning on affecting her and finding someone else to rent.\n\nMy heart is broken. With the planning this for over a year. And I know she\u2019s depressed. But she could go back to work tomorrow and make double what I do a day. With a career she\u2019s in she could still go back to work even after having quit.\n\nI loved her so much. And we had built detailed and amazing plans together. But she\u2019s just stopped moving.\n\nI know she\u2019s depressed but I don\u2019t know what to do for her. I\u2019ve tried talking to her I\u2019ve tried offering to help her. I\u2019ve offered to take her to a doctor. I\u2019ve told her that I\u2019m there for her. But I can\u2019t do this for her. It\u2019s like she\u2019s just given up.\n\nAnd I love her, but this is not the agreement that we had together. If she was willing to go see a doctor I would at least be able to work with her. And find a way to make this work. But I can\u2019t support somebody who sick and refuses to go see help. It\u2019s been a month and a half since she moved and it\u2019s been a disaster.\n\nI feel like there should\u2019ve been warning signs but there wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s like a flip switched and she\u2019s turned into a different person. I\u2019ve lost my girlfriend. It\u2019s like she\u2019s dead and there\u2019s this shell standing in front of me.\n\nI don\u2019t know what else to do... i\u2019ve given her all I can afford to give emotionally and monetarily and unless she\u2019s willing to help her self I\u2019m done.\n\nTLDR: girlfriend did not pay the rent she promised she would. And has severe depression. I\u2019ve tried to help her and I have no more to give.",

I've noticed you losing interest in hobbies, isolating and turning down social activities, you've stopped taking care of yourself and you have some reason why everything \"can't\" be done. That's depression and you need to go back to your doctor. I'll go with you if it'll help.\"\n\nCue non-committal noises. \n\nSome examples: he's been getting chronic, debilitating headaches. He's always had headaches since I've known him bit they're getting worse and more frequent. By a lot. He says they're tension headaches and chiropractic has helped in the past? Has he gone? OF COURSE NOT! He \"can't\" because his old chiro retired, he \"can't\" because he doesn't know which ones take his insurance, he \"can't\" because his work schedule is up in the air (it is to a point but he has EVERY MONDAY OFF). Instead, he just lets the headaches eat his life, calls in sick to work, cancels plans and complains. At this point it IS just complaining because he won't DO anything about them. \n\nSame with his teeth. He has broken teeth, cavities, a missing crown. I can't even kiss him anymore because I take immunosuppressants and I can't contact the infection he has. He \"found\" a dentist 2 months ago...... and never called. \n\nHe got new glases late last year and the RX doesn't suit him. He \"can't\" go back and have them remade, he'll just get new ones in January because he gets a free pair every year. It's now February. He's made no motions to do that either.\n\nI can't be his nurse and his mother.

            "I was in an eerily similar situation a few years back.  Girlfriend moved to my state after having an LDR for several months.  I was 21 at the time, she was 18.\n\nI had a crappy entry level job at a call center and she snagged a job at the same place.  Things were pretty good for a while until my car died/was replaced and we moved into an apartment for just the two of us.  With 2 incomes it was relatively easy to make all the bills.  Then she quit because of depression, anxiety, and a lack of willingness to get help.\n\nMoney was tight, but she always wanted nice things like sushi, and stupid 21/22 y/o me was too stupid to say no most of the time.  When I DID say no with the reason of money, she would berate me saying \"MONEY ISN'T EVERYTHING\".  From that point on I didn't talk about money.  After several months in the apartment, I asked my dad for help and we moved in with him and I paid to break the lease.  In those months and the ones that followed, I ended up in severe credit card debt and took out perpetual payday loans (back before the APR was capped in NV, so it was like 800%).  Credit cards defaulted, went to collections, life was shit.\n\nI dealt with her for two more years.  My mistake there.  Eventually I realized how toxic she really was, and figured out how to convince her that it was her idea to leave (she didn't want to leave me in the debt she helped cause, but when she finally got and quit 2 other jobs she never helped fix it).  I let her go.\n\nAll I can say is that love is blind and stupid.  We all make mistakes but the best thing you can do is try to assess the situation early and cut out toxicity.\n\nBest of luck, kind redditor.",
            "I'm sorry, but a lot of people on here seem to not get severe depression at all. Yes, this situation might be problematic, but as someone else already stated: never move into a flat or house you can't afford on your own.\nYes, she probably should see a doctor.

            "This is one of those trials that will make or break your relationship. Both of your actions and attitudes point towards \"break\", imo. It didn't read like a true partnership. Unless you all find a compromise-sacrifice situation you can both live with, there's no saving the relationship. She also has to be willing to contribute. That is her end of the sacrifice. You cant be sacrificing everything for her while shes unwilling to.sacrifice anything. This is exactly why you should always live with someone before you marry them. My husband currently owes me money for rent, I've been covering for him for months while he was trying to find a good job. I've made many sacrifices for him and for us, and he eased my burdens in ways he was able until he finally got a good job. Partnership means picking up the slack when your partner needs it. She also has to be willing to do that. It can't all be on you. Is she applying for jobs? Is she seeing a doctor? Those are the efforts she needs to be focusing on. I just wonder if you even love her as much as you say, or if you're hung up on the idea of love. You love all the dreams you have together, but do you love the reality of what you all already have? Are your future dreams as important as your money now? Does she contribute anything at all? Housework, cooking, does she, at the very least, make you laugh?

            "Don't burn out trying to keep someone else alight. \nHorrible situation. I really really feel for you. ",
            "How long has it been going on?\n \nYou are not obligated to be a doormat for her, but people who are in love someone tend not to make decisions within a month to kick out a partner due to depression. I waited for years to kick out my ex husband and I didn't even love him. Not saying anyone should wait years and I may be getting the wrong impression, but it seems like she has no real status in your life above a room mate or a business partner you made a deal with. \n\nNot saying her behaviour is okay, it's not, but I'd be feeling SO ridiculously alone if my partner was considering kicking me to the curb while I was having a breakdown. \n\nCan she not move into your room if money is such an issue? Nice to have your own space, my boyfriend and I have separate rooms too. We watch TV/netflix, cuddle for hours, have sex and then I sneak off to my bed to get better sleep for my own sanity. Plus I can keep watching TV and not keep him awake, and just have my own place to retreat and have alone time. But my bf owns the house. I pay him some rent but he doesn't need the money. I have anxiety/depression/exhaustion/chronic fatigue etc and I worry I won't be able to keep going forever. He 100% knew about it all before we moved in together. He says I don't have to work forever and he's willing to support me at some stage but I obviously don't want to cause that kind of stress in his life. It's nice to know that we could fall on each other if we really lost it though. That's life partnership though, compared to dating. \n\nSo I understand your situation from both sides. I had a very lazy abusive mooching ex husband who claimed to have depression (he was violent too) and now I'm depressed, anxious, exhausted and worry I'll break down and not be able to take care of all my responsibilities. \n\nI think maybe she needs some time. I wouldn't feel comfortable to talk to you about it if I sensed you were going to kick me out and get another boarder to replace me. I wouldn't feel like I was even in a relationship with you. I know she has messed up and broken plans/promises, but maybe she's dealing with sonething serious that you don't know about. \n\nIt's up to you how you want to live your life and up to you what you will put up with in a relationship and for how long. You just need to make sure you're honest too, make sure any partner you have knows that if they fail to meet financial arrangements with you or quit their job then it's over in X amount of time, that you expect 50/50 type of arrangements and you cannot/will not ever financially support a partner at all. Because it's actually not a bizarre thing in some relationships, so you have to be clear. Also she should of been very up front if this was a pre existing issue of hers. \n\nUltimately when you are planning to kick someone out, then the love is probably not there. It's very hard to love someone who's being abrasive and not contributing. Maybe if you had been together longer then you'd feel differently about the situation but it's only been around a year. This is why I waited 3 years to move in with my boyfriend, I just wasn't sure how I would go or how everything would be... Didn't trust myself, relationships or life in general, so I had to take it slowly. \n\nI may have missed some details but you said you wanted this nice new place, had you lived together somewhere before? If not, best you move into a cheap first place together so that finances aren't such an issue. You said you guys planned all this for over a year, and said you've been together just over a year. Moving in together isn't usually planned out in like the first week of a relationship.\n\nAlso \"seek professional help\" is always such a generic suggestion. I've suffered quite severe mental health issues for most of my life and I have tried countless psychologists, psychiatrists, GPs, medications, natural treatments, exercise, psychiatric inpatient treatment, etc etc. It annoys me if people claim I \"refuse\" to get help. I have done everything in the book to get help and it didn't help. Seeing a professional is not going to automatically fix or even help everyone. I tried again recently and the expensive psychologist said she doesn't think she can help me and thinks I'd be wasting my money to rebook. It's not the first time. It's not because I'm defiant in any way, I'm very receptive and try anything. It's when I keep returning and saying I don't feel any different, they eventually turn me away. \n\nGood luck, hope you both find what you need. ",
            "There is a difference between not being able to afford it on your own and not wanting to allocate that much of your income to rent (probably a decreasing the quality of living for both of you).\n\nI had a similar situation. The lease was in her name, and she was working two jobs in order for us to qualify for the lease. She had some physical and mental health issues, called off and and eventually was unemployed. I had to choose whether to move back to my parents house, save money, pay off my student loans. Or stay, struggle and support her.\n\nI stayed. Honestly looking back it was a terribly made and irrational decision, but I decided I was okay with a financial loss to stay with her. I didn't think I would be able to look my friends in the eye again if I told them I abandoned her.\n\nShe bounced back and forth a few more times. I tried to pay off the credit cards and save a bit when she was working, tightened the belt when she wasn't. Eventually my income was enough to buy a house. We got married. She's still the love of my life, and last year she gave up on working and focused on being a home maker instead. Money is still tight, but it's getting better every year, and I'm really loving not having to do dishes, laundry, shopping, etc. I never envisioned being a sole breadwinner, but here I am and it's not a bad life. \n\nSo my suggestion to you, as an accountant, is to evaluate the whole transaction of the relationship. Just because it's a financial loss doesn't mean it's a total loss. But you also are responsible for taking care of yourself. It comes down to- how much is she worth to you? Do you have faith that she will recover, or are you able to accept if she does not?\n\nThese are questions I suggest anyone asks before moving in together, because if you aren't willing/able to support each other moving in may be a bad idea.

I have gotten a master's degree since we've been married, but I can't use it because I have to take care of my child. This is a son from my first marriage. His dad isn't around. I feel like a bunch of this shit is not within my control. We have 4 other kids. I am burned out. I know he is too, but fuck I do try. Hard. I ask for exactly what I need. I'm sure he's exhausted. I am too. I never withhold from him though. He would say I am like a child he has to care for. I don't agree because I take care of everything for the kids, basically, all cooking, cleaning, he doesn't do jack shit but the yard work. He does work hard. So do I. If I had more emotional support and attention I could do so much more for the family, but he's not willing to give more. I wonder what his perspective would be though. If y'all could read both sides. Who knows? All I know is this is different. If she won't even go to the doctor... Come on. I am actively trying to get better while caring for 7 people (including myself). People with mental illness need love and support and if you truly have nothing left to give you have to take care of you first and foremost, but if you're just unwilling because she's not trying...be honest. Because if you kick her out and you break up you at least owe it to her to be honest so she can find someone maybe who is even more nuturing than you are, and/or realize she needs real help and get it. I share my experience because I get how she feels. A lot. She probably is so ashamed she doesn't have the money. Even still, I wouldn't do nothing about it. I guess that's the difference.

After about 1.5 years working there, I was out of a job. My closest friend at that job was Beth. \n\n\nBeth and I decided we were going to make a team effort at finding new jobs, since we knew we were going to be applying at the same jobs anyway. We have very similar experiences and backgrounds.\n\n\nShe and I were incredibly diligent with our job search. I can't stress this enough. I had written six unique cover letters and resumes that served as templates--they highlighted my experiences in ways that catered to the jobs I was applying. Each template had a label and a description. When I applied for a job, I would read the description, match that to whichever template was the most suited, and applied, etc. \n\n\nBeth did the same thing with hers. We also were incredibly diligent at editing each others resume/cover letters for spelling errors. I know that I read mine over and over and over again, since we all know grammar mistakes are the quickest way to get your job application sent to the trash. \n\n\nSo, here's what happened. It has been six months. I've been incredibly unsuccessful at landing a job, while Beth got one almost immediately. Even though I was unemployed, Beth helped me all the time, reading over my letters, sending out recommendations on my behalf, everything. \n\n\nWell, guess what? Beth sabotaged me. In my cover letters, she snuck in a \"you're not really reading this, fuck you\" just smack dab in the middle of my letter. This was AFTER I had poured over every detail for spelling errors. Since I discovered this, I tried to confront her about it, and she has been avoiding me ever since.\n\n\nIs there anything I can do? I have literally applied for HUNDREDS of positions, and I'm worried that I'm just permanently blacklisted. I'm so angry and so hurt.\n\n\n**tl;dr** My friend, who was supposed to be helping me get a job, sabotaged me intentionally by sneaking in \"you're not really reading this, fuck you\".

Tell her that her actions were horrible, you expected better from her, block her on all social media, delete her number (or, at least, keep a copy of it in an address book somewhere out of reach before deleting) and tell all your friends about the time you trusted somebody who turned out to be a snake.  Redouble your efforts on applying for jobs, write new cover letters from scratch, and hopefully you'll be able to get a new job.\n\nI don't believe in karma, but I do believe that nastiness like this has a way of catching up to people.  Even if nothing happens as a direct result of her burning you in this way, it does show a certain poverty of spirit that will mar all her relationships, not just this one, and eventually somebody will discover how petty she can be and will implement consequences on her.\n\nJoke option:  Send her an angry diatribe, write 'you're not really reading this, fuck you' in the middle of it.",

Slightly rewrite each cover letter to adjust to the criteria of each job.\n\nSix templates is not going to cover the requirements of every job, or most jobs even. It's possible you wouldn't have been getting much work anyway using such generic cover letters. Employers would probably notice you are just sending templates, it's a bit obvious.\n\nIf you apply for a new job with the same firms you've applied for, right at the top of the email mention that someone had previously edited your cover letters without your knowledge and hence the previous bizarre cover letter.",

            "Well what a crap head Beth is. Cut her out of your life and move on.\n\nRewrite your resume and cover letter templates. Start from scratch with brand new files and new designs. Maybe create a new email address or get a new number if possible. \n\nThen work from those templates but always be super thorough and customize your response to each application. It's on you to proof before you hit \"send\". I always store my templates in Word and proof there. Then when everything looks great I PDF each document and the PDF versions are what I send. \n\nBasically you need to start over and act like it never happened. There will be no blacklist and honestly most companies get hundreds of applications for jobs so it's possible they never saw your application anyway.",
            "Although it's terrible I don't think it will be the end of the world. I would take your new cover letters and send them to all the companies you applied to before.\n\nRemember most tech organisations have HR staff that pour over received resumes and throw away the unsuitable ones pretty quickly. Most likely they would have seen the fuck you and just dropped your application without much care.\n\nWorst case scenario, they don't reply again. Best case scenario they don't remember you and you get an interview.\n\nAlso be wary of your \"friend\" at the very least warn any mutual friends you have and make sure she hasn't don't anything else that could have sabotaged you that you haven't noticed yet.",
            "All I can say for Beth is never speak to her again. Purge her. Block her from everything, don't rise to her level and attack. Awful people like her have a fantastic way of twisting things to make themselves the victim. If you attack her in anyway she'll justify her actions. If you block her and move on. She'll have to spend the rest of her life knowing she did a super shitty thing, and she'll have no good way of justifying it. At least that's how I've looked at it when people have done something horrible to me. ",

Don't reach out to her, don't contact her, act as if she doesn't exist. There will come a time when you will have an advantage. Maybe not next year, maybe not 5 years from now, but that time will come, trust me. In my 20s I had some bad experiences with some coworkers/friends (although to be honest, nowhere near as bad as yours). I minded my own business and did my own thing. I'm pushing 40, but I came out ahead by so much, it's not even funny. Living well is the best revenge. I cannot emphasize this enough. Having a great career will be the best thing you can do for yourself. The rest will follow. I'm rooting for you.",

I've gotten interviews for every job I've ever applied for, and hired at 90% of them. As someone who's also been on the other side and has had to look through dozens of resumes, it's easy to spot the generic \"shotgun resumes.\" There's plenty of jobs out there, but people are looking for those who stand out, not those who just mass-produce applications and use the same generic cover letter.",

            "First, you're not effectively using a cover letter.  The cover letter is your chance to tell each employer why you are **PERFECT** for that job, beyond your resume.  If you're just using a template, (even one of several templates) you're missing a chance to explain why you're a fit for that specific role.  Take the job description or posting and look at what they really need, what's the pain behind the job (is the business growing? do they need someone who is really good at working with the sales or creative teams, and so needs to be able to understand their needs and translate that into your work? etc.) and answer why you're a good fit beyond the *\"I did x for x years and I'm so reliable, dependable, and fast learning.\"*\n\nSecondly, now you've learned a valuable lesson.  Don't rely on anyone else for things like this.  You should have known that you'd be competing with Beth for jobs.  I would cut Beth out of your life.  She's a slimeball.\n\nThird, you need to connect with employers beyond hiring fairs.  I doubt you're blacklisted - in the tech industry, you've applied for a lot of jobs that the recruiter isn't likely to even remember your name.  Actually, people not reading your cover letters is still likely a bigger issue for you than the \"fuck you.\"  Can you do internships?  Fellowships?  Get creative.  Go to events in your industry - not just networking events but classes, conferences, etc.  Anywhere you can get in.  Use linkedin to research who your supervisor might be at the type of job you want and get in touch with them.  If there are recruiters out there who you offended, telling them that your friend sabotaged you when she was supposed to be applying for jobs for you is not exactly going to be impressive.",

That's an advantage you lose by drawing attention to it. \n\nSay you do go scorched earth, then what? Beth probably gets canned, true enough, but people will forget her looooong before they forget you. You'll be that (intentionally harsh here) idiot who didn't proofread her cover letter, let some jackal fleece her to get a leg up, then whined and lashed out. Some people will actually hold that against you much more than what she did because, warped as it may be, she looks like someone willing to do what it takes to get ahead; a winner.

Fortunately, no one has met you in person yet. ",

Say it was a very immature prank on behalf on a very immature friend and that is all, and apologize for the unprofessionalism. Don't elaborate. Don't attach an updated resume. Just an apology. \n\nSecondly, I can't even begin to imagine what kind of scummy person she is. I would tell her off once, and cut her out of your life unilaterally.  I would never condone doing something publicly, but dear god if you see her out I would call her out loudly and humiliate her. If not karma is a bitch.",
