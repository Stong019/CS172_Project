My buddy's girlfriend was making out with another guy and you need to help me, ya know?\" \n\nHe of course agreed and asked me on a date afterwards - I'm taken so I obviously said no, but I did show the footage to my friend who dumped his girlfriend.\n\nJust kidding. I went back to the pub and politetly asked the manager for footage of that night. He agreed to show me (!!!!!!!!!!) and then I showed it to my friend. I left a really big tip and I wanna give a shout out to u/reelniggaonehunna for the idea. Thanks!!!!!!!!!!\n\nMy friend was devastated, of course. He had been dating Candice for 8 years. But he said \"I knew you weren't lying, I just couldn't accept it\".

            "You are a good friend.  Everyone can use a friend like you.  Cheers dude.\n\nEdit - seriously, after he said what he did to you, you responded not with \"fuck you forever, you asshole\", but with \"ok he's in a bad place, can I still help him\".  Good shit",
            "Nice job!!!\nHe should be thankful you had his back",
            "Good he dumped that trash! You are a good friend.",
            "from personal experience, you might not be out of the woods yet. I did this years ago and after a few months they got back together and then my friend wasn't allowed to hang out with me anymore because I was a bad influence on him apparently. But fuck them, they deserve each other.",

            "I'm a little bit shocked at the whole positive feedback as far as the comments are concerned. I am happy you proved that you were right, but to me you need to re-weigh what you're willing to do to save this friendship against what you think your friend would be willing to do to save this friendship. I think you need to realize the fact that his reaction was to lash out at you rather than to ask if you have evidence. Saying \"I don't believe you\" vs \"You're gay and just want to get in my pants\" are 2 vastly different reactions. It may just be me but for the latter, I wouldn't be willing to walk back to a bar and get evidence to prove myself right just to save the friendship you both share.",

After my first post on a Tuesday, I had asked my husband if he\u2019d go on a little weekend getaway with me. We went to a cabin up in the mountains, neither of us had cell phone service. I planned for that, as I wanted to make sure I had his full attention. The first night went fantastic, and I almost forgot everything about my concerns with my sister.\n\nWhen we woke up the next morning, we cooked breakfast together but he was rather quiet. I asked if he\u2019d go on a little walk with me, which he agreed to. When we reached the lake, there were some large rocks that you could sit on. We both sat on the same rock, and we sat there in silence for what felt like forever. I finally got the courage to bring up the concerns I had with my sister and him, and his face went white.\n\nHe admitted to falling in love with my sister, he said that it all started because of how much they have in common. They spend more time together at work, than he does with me at home. He said he feels like he can talk to her about anything, and it never gets tiring. He said he\u2019s never felt more alive than he does when he\u2019s with her, and they started having a physical affair in October. The emotional affair began in June (after working with her for a couple of months since the end of April). He apologized for hurting me, and deceiving/betraying me.\n\nI asked him what he wanted to do about it, and he said that as much as he knows it will hurt me to say - he no longer is in love with me. The most painful thing I\u2019ve ever heard in my life is when he said that the way he feels for her, made him realize that he\u2019s never once felt that way for me even at the time when he loved me the most. He said it\u2019s not comparable by any measure, and he doesn\u2019t feel right staying married to me.\n\nWe are splitting in agreement that the marriage is over, but yes I am heart broken. They have both applied to transfer jobs to a different city with the same company, and he offered to let me keep the house. I told him that I didn\u2019t want the house, because it reminds me of him/us. We have split the finances, and he is giving me more money than he is taking. We are getting ready to list it for sale, and I have been packing and doing odds and ends like painting. He said I could keep the full amount of the house sale. New carpet/flooring comes tomorrow, and the movers come this afternoon. I found a small house for myself to start fresh, but I know it will take some time for me to not be so heart broken.\n\nMy sister on the other hand is not handling it as kindly as he is, and she is gloating. She even \u201caccidentally\u201d sent me a photo of both of them where you can tell she is in heaven because she won him away from me. She changed her profile photo to a picture of her taking a selfie of herself smiling very smug, as he is kissing her forehead. I unfollowed her on TikTok because now she\u2019s posting videos and photos of them together, some of them are from months ago and it kicked me in the heart. I asked him if he could please ask her to stop, he said he\u2019d talk to her about it but nothing has changed. I have removed myself from social media for now, except for reddit.\n\nMy mother is favoring my sister's side, saying that she\u2019s not posting those things to \u201churt me\u201d, and my sister deserves to be happy. My mom said it\u2019s my fault for looking, and I need to stop being so petty. My father is taking the white flag, and said he\u2019d like to stay out of it. He said it\u2019s not right what my sister did, but she\u2019s still his daughter. He said he won\u2019t accept their relationship, and he is here for me for whatever I need - but he won\u2019t be in the middle of this. I respect his decision on that, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not an easy place to be in.\n\nThank you all for the kind words, and all of the advice that was given. I probably didn\u2019t add everything, but my brain is kind of foggy at the moment.\n\nTL;DR: My husband admitted to being in love with my sister, and having an affair. He asked for a divorce, and they are pursuing their relationship officially.\n\n**Edit:** For those thinking that this unrealistic because it was magically resolved in 18 days, it is far from resolved. They are moving to a different office because he said he feels guilty, and doesn't want to be near me. They have not transferred yet, because they can't for a while due to lack of openings. I worded it wrong, which is my fault. I wanted to update as much as possible as to try to put closure to this for those asking for an update. Also, I am NC with all of them except my STBX at the moment and will be for a long time, if not forever. I will be NC with him after the divorce.",

            "My sister likes to steal men away from other women too. Trust me, it\u2019s not going to last.  She\u2019s going to get bored once she realizes it\u2019s not \u2018getting\u2019 to you. I give it 4 years max. \n\nI warn men I\u2019m in a relationship with how unfortunate she is, only one has ever fallen for it. Her friends don\u2019t always realize it soon enough so she\u2019s gotten a few of theirs. \n\nThe best revenge is living a good life. Don\u2019t let her see you sweat.",
            "Woah. I\u2019m so sorry. That is just awful, from all of them.",
            "OP I'm so sorry you're going through this and clearly your sister takes after your mother, as your mother doesn't think her daughter being a POS is any concern and you should just get over it.\n\nIs she just expecting you to be happy at family gatherings, but I can guess that you'll get the ultimatum from your mum, they're always going to be welcome and you come or don't.  Way to parents not holding their children to account for shitty behaviour.\n\nYour ex is also a huge POS.  I wish them paranoia and a lifetime of itchy genitals on your behalf.\n\nYou do what is right for you/your mental health. At that may also mean going LC with your parents as it doesn't sound like they support you at all.",
            "My heart sank. I felt the heartbreak, and the betrayal not only by these 2 vile people but from her family as well. I\u2019m so sorry Op, I can\u2019t imagine.. I wish I was your friend IRL.. no one is fighting for you. People make me sick.",
            "The fact that your (ex-)husband isn't shutting your sister's behavior down shows very much that he isn't \"handling this kindly\". He is giving you the money for the house *for himself*, to absolve himself of the guilt he might feel or to look less shitty in front of the people who might take your side. \n\nIt has nothing to do with you. If he had any love (even platonic love) or respect for you, he would have broken up with you before starting a relationship with anyone else, no matter with whom. Your sister is more open about her not giving a shit about you (or even hating you), but he isn't any better. We are the company we keep and this woman is the one he has chosen. \n\nI think you need to take a big, big step away from your whole family, including your parents, after you're done with the divorce and thus not needing to stay in contact anymore. It sounds like none of these people really love and support you - quite the opposite. Please find yourself a good therapist and a healthy support network in form of great friends who have your back.",
            "I know exactly what's going on.\n\nYour sister is a spoiled narcissist brat.\n\nYour husband is being love bombed by her. Your husband does not realize that he is not in a real relationship with her.\n\nI give it six months before he's in for a world of shock. Her mask will slip, and the true abusive nature will come out. \n\nI don't think she even likes him that much. He provides her value because he belonged to you, her own sister. She's probably been jealous of you her whole life and has been validating her own self-worth by putting you down. Your parents have gone along with it, haven't they? \n\nNow that she has him, she will look down on him.\n\nWith a year he will either be in a miserable relationship, or seriously regretting what he has done.\n\nThere are no winners here. And what he did was clearly wrong.\n\nHe was tested, and he failed. He is going to lose everything.",
            "this is brutal, OP, i am so so sorry for what you're going through\n\ni hope you can find some peace and really take care of yourself! you deserve it!",
            "I'm so sorry OP, the betrayal must be so hard to bear.  Your husband is a coward for making you confront him and end the relationship. A better man would have confessed about an emotional affair and ended things amicably before taking things further with your sister.  You are truly well rid of such a weak man and deserve a love more intense and lasting than his lukewarm feelings. \n\nI'm glad they are moving away so they are not in your face all the time, but know that this will not last forever for them. Your sister is gloating now, but the novelty will quickly disappear as they settle into normal life. She'll then be off looking for more intrigue and excitement.\n\nYour sister is truly your mother's daughter. Did your mum already know about the affair? You are mourning the end of your marriage, in the most horrible way, and it is not petty to be upset at your sister's gloating in the triumph of her betrayal. Please go no contact with her and only communicate with your dad. *(Edit: I'm glad to see OP has gone NC with both parents. Dad needs to prove himself as not taking sides is still taking the sister's side)*\n\nI'm so proud of you OP, you know your worth and took action with your life. Take care and aim for the stars.",
            "I'm so sorry for everything you're going through. Your ex-husband was extremely cruel in all the details he gave you regarding their affair, especially comparing your sister and you knowing all about your own relationship with her.\n\nGather your friends and tell them what has been happening so that your side is the one that comes out first and they're here to support you. You will probably feel alone in the next few months so I hope you can surround yourself with people who care for you.\n\nI'm sending you all the good luck, hugs and positive vibes your way and wishing you the best for your life rebuilding.",

            "PETTY. YOUR MOTHER CALLED YOU PETTY.\n\nWell now we know where your sister comes from.\n\nGet rid of all of them and start fresh. You don't need these vultures in your life.\n\nAnd eventually your husband is going to realize that without the \"thrill\" of a secret relationship there is probably nothing there.\n\nI hope you can find peace.",
            "Wowwwww I\u2019m so, so sorry. That whole situation is so awful. And I\u2019m sorry your parents aren\u2019t taking your side, especially your mom who has taken your sister\u2019s side. That\u2019s so unfair. I hope that now you find someone who truly loves you and would never hurt you. The trash takes itself out. It doesn\u2019t feel like it now, but they both did you a favor. You deserve to be loved fully and completely by someone who would never betray you.",
            "Take everything he offers. All the money.  Once you settle in your home, cut all of them off/block them for at least 6 months(but your sister, honestly, I wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with her ever again) and maybe do some therapy and check out some new hobbies and activities to make new connections and friends.

            "NoCo your Mom.  Completely. \nShe\u2019s made her choice, and it isn\u2019t you. \n\nThere is no White Flag.

            "Oh OP, I am so, so sorry. Your update made my heart hurt for you. Your husband and sister are awful people. Your sister is also evil and spiteful. He is so freaking stupid and in the middle of the affair fog. Once he\u2019s stuck with your witch of a sister the blinders will eventually fall off. She will also get bored because he\u2019s no longer the prize he was when he was your spouse. She will find a new prize to have to win and leave him the same way he\u2019s done you. \n\nHas she always been jealous of you or was perceived as the golden child? I just can\u2019t imagine ever being happy to have stolen your siblings spouse and taken away their happiness. And I\u2019m disgusted by your parents. They can still love your daughter while condemning her actions/choices. The ex would never again be welcome as a part of my family. I have two children and would NEVER accept their behavior just because they\u2019re family. Actions have consequences and they should see more nasty ones for their choices. \n\nYou sound like you are handling this with so much grace. I would have a really hard time not responding to her posts with things like \u201chope my sloppy seconds are satisfying to your black soul\u201d or \u201chope I tasted great on him.\u201d  I\u2019m sorry but I really would want to rake her over the coals. I would probably post myself exposing their betrayal so everyone would know they didn\u2019t start up after you separated. You apparently are a better person than me. \u2665\ufe0f\n\nI wish you nothing but peace and happiness as you move in to the next phase of your life. That might happen more if you separate yourself from your mother, and maybe even your father, and surround yourself with people who do not support the behavior of your sister and ex. All the best to you.",
            "What a coward to wait until you bring it up to turn around and say shit like that. How can he claim he never felt as strong about you as her but those feelings weren't strong enough for him to tell you so he could be with her out in the open..... my prediction is it will not last. Soon he will find someone else and do the same to her. I'm so sorry your sister and mother don't respect or love you. Sounds like your sister ended up just like your mum.",

            "I am so sorry to read this update. I am so, so sorry. I also believe that your STBX and your horrible, evil sister will get their comeuppance eventually. In my (well over) over 6 decades on the third rock from the sun, I have seen VERY few relationships or marriages that begin with affairs continue happily. These are relationships that begin with lies, deceit, and hurting innocent people, and those things really do poison relationships over time.\n\nYour sister, having intentionally dazzled your STBX and won her prize, will get bored with him and move onto bigger, better challenges. Your STBX, having thrown away someone who loved him for himself and not for the challenge of stealing him, will eventually realize that he threw away gold for glitter. Your mother has lost a daughter (you should go NC with her and make it stick), and your father? He's lost a lot of your love as well, and all he has is a narcissistic other daughter who will never do anything out of genuine love.\n\nPlease, please cut all these people out of your life and build a new life with friends who become your family of choice. You are still so young, you have all the time in the world to build a new life with people who love and value you. I wish you all the best. ALL the best. Oh, and when your STBX eventually comes to you crying because what he threw away has hit him hard, don't offer him your shoulder (or anything else). He made his terrible choice. He gets to live with it for the long haul.\n\nETA: OP, a few other commenters have mentioned family gatherings. I'd suggest you avoid ALL family gatherings for at least a few years - certainly, avoid them until your STBX and your piece-of-work sister end their own relationship (which they almost certainly will), and even for a few years after that. Then, I'd avoid anything where your sister is present for at least a decade or so. Block your sister on social media and make it stick. Maybe block your mother too, if she's reposting your sister's garbage. Your sister's target was you, not your STBX. Eventually he is going to realize that, and by then it will be far, far too late. I wish you your best life going forward without these horrible people in it.",

The therapist will help you work through the complicated layers of emotions you're facing regarding the double-betrayal, the family stuff, your feelings of self-worth, all of that... and the group will allow you to talk openly about what has happened in a non-judgemental setting where you'll see that you are **absolutely not alone**.  AND, that group can also give you hope because there will be people there (usually facilitators/group leaders, etc) who have come out on the other end, and are happy and thriving.   You can be happy and thrive again too.  \n\nYou can and will have a great life despite this.

Your dad needs a spine, but he's still living with your mother so I get the self preservation tactic. A little. \n\nMy heart breaks for you, but at least you have the answer and can move forward. You don't want a disloyal husband anyway.  Continue being NC with sister and the treacherous ex. Go LC with Mommie Dearest, also.\n\nJust take it all one day at a time, one foot in front of the other.

You deserve to be surrounded by warmth and support - and your whole family seems to think you don't deserve honesty, faithfulness, kindness, loyalty.\n\nInstead of a house in the same town, maybe consider something different - is there a town far away where you can really dig deep for a new start? Find love, find friendships, hobbies, and work somewhere your parents can't stab you deep? Where you can get therapy,  and never worry or think about your sister again (aside from, \"thank God she's out of my life)?\n\nAfter time goes by and the shine wears off, these two are going to get a sick feeling inside. Sister took what was precious to you, and that was her motivation. Now that she \"won\",  her sparkle will die down, unless she can somehow keep salt rubbed in your wounds (so stay off social media), keep her blocked everywhere. She NEEDS to keep you reacting for her pleasure to continue). Once he realizes he was just a trophy to prove she was \"better\" then you, he'll start picking up her character flaws. He'll realize what he did. He might come begging back someday. Don't be where he can find you, once everything is completed.\n\nHealing will come from moving forward slowly but surely. Lean on people who aren't your family. Love yourself, and realize you've been surrounded by pathetic folk. Create your own family, and leave these behind. \"Sorry, won't be in town for Christmas, I'll be traveling\".  Permanently. \"Gosh I'd LOVE to have a sit-down family being where we talk about me needing to be happy for sister. How unfortunate I'll be going to work seminars for the next month.\" Make things up as you please until your comfortable ditching them completely.\n\nFind the real love of your life, and don't make any instructions to people back home.

What a worthless egg donor.\n\nYour ex is an idiot.  Your sister is only pretending to like him so she can sate her sadistic appetite with your pain.

It's like hard drugs, they make normal reality seem boring in comparison, but it's not real, and that effect won't last, and it trashes your life. That's what he's chosen.

Just a normal life - can their relationship survive the ordinary? And what is to love really, how can he love the person who gloats in their siblings misery, really? They might stay together or not, but both of them just got the prize they deserve, so let them bath in that mud together.",

            "Given that your sister is gloating, this suggests that your sister has serious jealousy issues with you and that their relationship is completely fake. What I mean by that is that she has portrayed herself as being perfect woman for him. This type of behavior is not sustainable, and will fade over time. I guarantee in the next 12 months he will try and come crawling back. Do not let him! Move on, and I guarantee you\u2019ll be happy without him, even though at the moment you\u2019re heartbroken. And as for your mum, she sounds absolutely horrible, and I would consider going low or no contact with her as well.

            "I know you have had a ton of comments and probably don't want to hear another one, but your sister is being incredibly cruel and your husband is an idiot. The fact that your sister began this affair and is now posting about it tells me that she is not a good person in her soul. That will come out and at some point down the road your husband is going to realize the huge mistake he made. Whether he ever says it out loud I don't know, but the woman that he thinks he loves is not real and at some point down the road he's going to realize that the woman in bed next to him is not a nice person. I am a mother of adult children and I understand the difficult position that your parents are in BUT Your mother's refusal to see the intentional cruelty of your sister posting couple pictures online is willful blindness. It could be that she just doesn't understand the realities of social media. But damn that is cold for your mom not to offer sympathy and support when you so desperately need it. I really feel for you. I can't imagine the depth of your pain right now, your sense of injustice and betrayal. I strongly urge you to find a good therapist. You're going to need one to get through this. Good luck to you.",

            "Your sister moved back home with no partner, no job, no house, no plans\u2026\u2026 then decided she wanted your life. It must have looked pretty good, Revolutionary. A person *who would even do this* is of such low character that there is something rotten inside them, and genuine love & happiness will continue to elude them. Thats why they\u2019re changing location: they want a fresh start where people won\u2019t know how they started together. They are the lowest form of cheater there is by choosing family to cheat with. And cheaters are already looked down on. If your partner can\u2019t trust you, why would anyone else? I hope this process is over for you as fast as possible. Your parents may realize they backed the wrong sister when she blows town, leaving only destruction in her wake.",
            "Here's my bet: at 3-6 months after living together, they're going to see some true colors pop up. They probably won't last a year. \n\nYes, some people are more exciting than others, but typically \"exciting\" goes hand in hand with \"toxic\", as we have seen with her severe lack of empathy and gloating towards you, *her own sister.* Disgusting.\n\nSafe relationships are often times more boring. \n\nOh well, that's life and he's now gonna find out the hard way.\n\nWanna accelerate their demise? Be the coolest person about this. Congratulate them at every milestone. Be chill and mature. Be happy for them. Because once her toxic shit crops up, he'll be looking back at what he could have had.\n\nTheir relationship will no longer be taboo with your blessing. You will no longer be this exciting hurdle for them to overcome.\n\nI've been in your shoes a few times. I'm boring and safe.

She wants to rile you up, make you the crazy ex she can gloat over, the loser she got one over on - but you\u2019re not giving it to her, and when whatever high she gets wears off (probably much sooner because of your lack of reaction), she\u2019ll drop him for someone else.

And your ex must be an insecure, spineless little worm (Ew...)\n\nSo you lost your gross ex, your toxic conniving sister, and completely disloyal and unempathetic family, all in one. Eventually, your ex will realise what a complete fool he is, and have to sit with the disgusting feeling of realising what he did for someone that it really isn't true love with. Your father will learn to regret his inaction one day and it will make changes in your family. Your sister will be disgusted with herself when she realises what an empty cavern of a life she has, built for years on nothing real, as she ticks away her years simply feeding her sadistic ego. She clearly is obsessed with you, and jealous to her core. It shows that she knows you're a full person, and she wants to tear down all of this.\n\nWell she can keep your loser ex. You're going to meet somebody 10 times hotter that has completely blown your expectations out of the water, and you're going to be filled with peace and satisfaction with your life, and you'll recognise them with every cell in your body what bottom-feeding scum they are. And you were a big fish in a small pond.\n\nFocus on you. Buy some clothes that you've never felt brave enough to wear. Experiment with your style. Pick up that hobby you always said you wanted to do. Get your nails done or paint them a pretty colour yourself. Maybe take a solo trip to a place you want to see. Write poetry. Cry for hours and feel the pain.\n\nYou now have a lot of empty space in your life with the loss of all these cowardly people. The space will make you feel very lost and alone and depressed. Find a therapist if you're financially able. Prioritise friendships (don't even worry about relationships at this time.) But in this space you'll eventually fill it with beautiful things.

        "selftext": "\n\nHello my friends near and far, I have never really used this before, so I apologize immensely for being unaware of certain posting criteria! I hope you are all doing well, and I thank you for taking the time to read this post!\n\n\nI have been with my partner for 7 years, we initially met online, and after meeting in person a few times, and realizing our affection for one another, we found it promising to move in together. I moved from California to Pennsylvania to be with him throughout graduate school. All was seemingly well during this time. I have never really had any reason to not trust him. I encouraged him to very much so, to try his best to make friends, or to explore hobbies on his own outside of the various ones we share, because I have my own passions, and I found we connected most when we met in the middle through conversations about these passions, through the act of explaining or showcasing what we've taken in or learned. \n\n\nThroughout these 7 years, he has struggled with very low self esteem, and though I don't necessarily think of myself as the pillar of self love, the depth of mine doesn't reach the low perception of his self value. Because of this, he has seen and stopped seeing, both a counselor, and a therapist, and has been on medication to help for the last 6 months.\n\n\nThings where seemingly well between us, and continued to be pretty fluid. We continued to share things, and take long walks, and where pretty open ended about where we stood in the relationship, if one was feeling a bit of an ebb, the other would pick up more of a share, and vice versa. \n\n\nHowever, things took a bit of a dip about 2 days ago, when I felt the ebb, and asked him about it. Initially, he said there was really nothing wrong, and perhaps I was just feeling this way because with our schedules we haven't been able to see one another for long periods of time like we are used to, which is true. But the feeling continued to irk me, and when I asked about it a second time, he confessed to me, he had begun talking to another girl from another country, via Instagram direct messages, and though things between she and him never crossed the boundaries of platonic friendship, he really loved the initial rush of someone asking him questions about his favorite movie, his favorite album, his favorite book, all things he and I already know very well about one another. I asked if he'd sent any selfies, or anything, risqu\u00e9, and he said no, though I can't confirm, because he deleted the messages, a good deal of me believes him, because of how open he was about the initial conversations to begin with. We slept apart, and I just felt really confused the entire night, because I couldn't really resonate with wanting that sort of attention from someone else. If anything, his yearning for that type of attention, sort of hurt. It felt like I wasn't doing enough, or giving enough.\n\n\nThe next morning, though I don't have an Instagram, and am not on the app, I went to check his using the desktop version, and found that posts where he once called me 'the love of his life' or a specific post with a gift I gave him that once said 'greatest gift from the greatest girl' where still on his profile, but the words, 'girlfriend' or 'love of my life' where completed erased. With this realization, my confusion and hurt turned to very real heartache. I called him and asked if he had deleted these words from the specific posts, and with shame, he said yes he did. When I asked why, he said it was because he just didn't want the attention from the girl asking him about himself to be disrupted if she found out he was in a long term relationship. I guess this is where, I asked the obvious and questioned why someone who is just asking about your favorite books, movies, etc, would be driven away by the fact that you have a girlfriend. And he said he didn't know why he did it, and that it was a massive mistake.\n\n\nAt the risk of seeming toxic, and I will take full accountability for seeming so or being so, I asked him to please deactivate his Instagram for the time being while we sort through this, his twitter as well. He did, and though I was feeling a bit of relief about that, I couldn't help but feel a bit saddened that he didn't choose to do that on his own for the benefit of our relationship, he had to wait for me to ask. Which again, just made me feel like such a toxic and controlling partner. Two things I always strive to be so far from.\n\n\nWhen he got home from work, we discussed everything at massive length, and he continued to swear up and down, that these conversations pertained strictly to music, movies, and books, and he didn't have interest in her, just interest in the initial rush of the attention he was receiving. We read a few articles, and he broke things down to me as his self esteem has never been lower, despite his career as a doctor being at a high, and his finances in order, he felt things with his music weren't taking off, and with that came a feeling that he wasn't special, and it was nice for someone to make him feel that way. I felt shame and asked him if I wasn't doing enough or giving enough to him to make him feel that way, he said, I defiantly was, but my love, and attention and affection, became a pillar he could rely on, and got used to, so with new attention came a rush, and he liked that. \n\n\nI asked him if he wanted to be single, and find that rush in dating new people, and he kept insisting that that's so far from what he wants. He wants to remain a couple, and do all he can to work on these things together. Though I can't help but correlate that feeling he enjoys with the feeling of a first date. Which hurts of course. I told him I didn't really see how we could move past this because there was nothing much for me to make an attempt to work on moving forward. This seems to be a self stemming problem, that I emphasize with, but just don't want to be on the receiving end of the counter effects. \n\n\nSo though it is incredibly uneasy to begin to think of how difficult it'll be to begin again, it is just as difficult to think about how difficult it would be to stay and try to rebuild back up an issue that I feel like just a bystander when it comes to. \n\n\nThis has all been very painful and if this comes to an end I just want it to be as civil and as possible. He deserves to love himself, but not at the expense of the love we have between us. I deserve love that is stable and comforting, and not laced with newfound paranoia. \n\n\nDespite this all, my heart is still very much in this of course, and he has been very vocal about how it was just one mistake, nothing happened, we can work through this, etc. And I secretly keep hoping he will make a step, any step really, to showcase these words and implement action, seek a new therapist, find the two of us a relationship counselor, buy a book on self help or on how couple conquer affairs, anything, anything at all, without me having to be the one to ask him. I just want him to have that yearning that he continues to say he has, but instead of saying it, I was him to show me. \n\n\nDo you think that makes me irrational or just plain dumb? I believe to be in a state where I can handle either answer. Or something completely different just the same!\n\n\nDo you all think I'm blowing something completely out of proportion? Given how this was an exchange of conversation between him and another girl for just a few days, and his erasure of me on his profile was only for about 2 days? \n\n\nAlas, we have come to the very end of this post, if you've made it, I can not thank you enough for giving me your time, if you take the time to post, I can not thank you enough for giving me your efforts. This has been a first in this relationship, this has been a first in my life truthfully, and throughout writing this I just felt completely vulnerable and isolated. So, if you've given me your time, thank you, thank you, thank you! I hope what happened to me, doesn't happen to you, and wish you all things gracious and good and completely fulfilling my friends! Best of luck, and all of my love and gratitude.\n\n\nTL;DR I've been in a relationship for 7 years, my partner recently and unexpectedly kept posts on Instagram that showcased us as a couple but deleted the words beneath them that included the words 'love of my life' and 'girlfriend' in order to continue to receive attention from another girl who lives in another country, who he says he shared a platonic relationship with via Instagram direct messages, and really only enjoyed the aspects of her asking him questions about his favorite things and giving him validation. He says he only erased those specific words in order to keep the flow of validation coming. He doesn't want to end things or see other people, I am a bit unsure about where to go or what to do.",

Just as concerning as him deliberately hiding you to gain the attention of another woman is his refusal to answer the question of why he did it when you asked directly.\n\n> And he said he didn't know why he did it, and that it was a massive mistake.\n\nPardon my French, but bullshit. He did it because he wanted to look like he was single so that he could entertain a potential romantic relationship with this other person. It's not lost on me that you two met online as well. If he can't even admit that was his motivation, there's every chance it will happen again.\n\nYou sound like a smart, empathetic, thoughtful person and you deserve someone who treats your love and respect with the care and reciprocity it deserves. He is not doing so.\n\nGood luck.",
            "So basically, you supported him through med school and his residency, and now that he's a fully-trained (or close to being so) physician, he's emotionally cheating on you because that's something he can fit into his hectic schedule.

Of course he doesn't want to break up with you - I bet you take care of all the domestic stuff for him so he never has to worry about grocery shopping/food-prep or doing laundry or cleaning the house.\n\nClassy.  Super classy.  Kick him out - you should not be forced to find a new place if you can afford where you're living on your own.  You have lit yourself on fire to keep him warm, and in return, he's erasing you for a fantasy.

I felt that my heart wasn\u2019t into it and I kinda missed the rush of meeting a new person. \n\n\nJust like your bf, I started to message with strangers because it was giving me that feeling of excitement that someone new was interested in me.\n\n\nAlso, just like your bf, it was the opposite sex who was asking and complimenting me, boosting my self-esteem. \n\n\nAsk yourself why doesn\u2019t he text some random guy, but a random girl. If it was just about someone being interested platonically then it could be a male friend, right?\n\n\nWell, the point is that it\u2019s not just about making a new friend, but about being bored with your partner and wanting a romantic or sexual thrill. \n\n\nI can guarantee that they were flirting and he is perhaps even more excited about the fact that going behind your partner\u2019s back is taboo. \n\n\nAlso, same as your bf I was deluding myself and my partner that it\u2019s just a little thrill and all\u2019s good. It wasn\u2019t. No-one would do that if they were content with their partner. \n\n\nYou can try to force yourself into believing that it is harmless and can be worked on. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s either preparing for breaking up or cheating.\n\n\nI broke up before it escalated, but what do you know - I began dating the same guy I was texting.\n\n\nIt\u2019s up to you to stay in this relationship, but to me it\u2019s clearly the end of what you two had.",

Love should be reciprocated. And effort needs to be honored in whatever way. This is a two way street. I personally find his behavior and reason for this mess up quite childish. Why risk a perfectly fine relationship for some novel and random attention. He needs a wake up call regarding this! \n\nHe needs to work on his self esteem. And you are right. Actions are always more important than words. If he doesn't show you he wants to change    you need to think about some consequences (give him a much needed \"wake up call\". He didn't really cheat on you so I think this is definitely salvageable. Couples counseling may be an option. \n\nIn case you work trough this then another aspect  is the \"routine\" seems to be strong in your life/ relationship. Maybe you could work on getting some fresh wind into your love life? Plan some fun dates, try something new. Do a lovey-dovey weekend trip.  \n\nYou are not being toxic.

I'm sorry but he doesn't get to pursue another woman and still keep you in his life. It doesn't matter that it only went on for a few days, it's the intent that matters. He consciously engaged another woman with romantic/sexual intent because your attention wasn't enough to scratch his itches, and he minimized his relationship you to further her interest. How far would he have gone with this had you not caught him? He wouldn't have deleted their messages if it was just platonic either. Low self-esteem is no excuse and \"I don't know why I did it\" is bullshit.\n\nThis is one of those things that once it happens, it changes the relationship forever and even if you try to reconcile, you'll never really be able to trust him again and you'll just drive yourself crazy trying to. Every time you see him online you'll wonder who he's talking to, and if you ask and he says no one, you won't believe him cause he had no problem being shady before. You'll ruminate and worry over ever female friend he makes cause he's shown you that his intentions with other women are not innocent.

            "While not the exact same situation, when my longish term high school boyfriend went to college, I found out from a mutual friend (who also went to the same college) that he refused to tell anyone there he had a girlfriend.

I can\u2019t imagine pretending I wasn\u2019t with my husband. I get it\u2019s really fun to make new friends and get that rush of excitement and new connection and being liked. But I have experienced all that with new friends while being completely open about the fact that I\u2019m married. The only reason to hide that is to lead someone on romantically. It sucks. It hurts. But this is indicative of a huge issue. It was \u201conly two days\u201d but he did not choose to fix it on his own. You made him. He changed it once YOU confronted him. It\u2019s up to you how you want to move forward, but I would really encourage you to think about whether you want to invest this much heartache in someone who seems to have so little investment in you.",

I don't think irreparable damage was done after only two days. but he MUST take steps, like you said. \n\nLet me first of all talk about what your partner felt when he was talking to this other person. It's called \"New Relationship Energy\" and it is a heady drug. But an important thing to note, is it FADES! It always, always fades. So while it is a rush now, that's all it is, a short term, rush. Like a drug. Since it seems like he's a Dr, you can even compare it to that. I mean, it's not a BAD thing. Just a short-term thing. It's all brain chemistry.\n\nNow for the meat of your message. I know what it is like to be with someone with low self esteem. It is really, really hard to explain to other people. That word, \"Low self esteem\" gets thrown around so much, and it doesn't mean what a lot of people say it does. Because it goes SO DEEP. It took me years and years before I had an inkling as to what it meant. He very likely believes he doesn't deserve to be with you. He doesn't deserve your kindness or your awesomeness. He could be sabotaging your relationship (w/out knowing it). That, coupled with someone else paying attention to him (What? Me? I'm nothing, I don't deserve anyone to listen to me, and my partner is so beyond anything I deserve, I'm going to talk to so-and-so, etc) sets up a spiral of self sabotage that proves to him he doesn't deserve happiness. He might not think he is worthy of getting help (therapy) or any kind of self care. Low self esteem is really serious. The negative self talk going on in their heads is so damaging. I wouldn't be surprised if he hasn't shared some of the bad stuff with you. You both are still pretty young and it took a long time for me to hear how bad it was. Because it can be bad. I'm not saying it necessarily is for him, I'm just saying it can be. \n\nNow NONE of this is to get him off the hook. He absolutely needs to step up! He needs to get back in to therapy. If who he was seeing wasn't working, then keep seeing different ones until someone clicks. And for sure couples therapy! But you do need to use your words. He won't be able to read your mind. I know you want him to just \"figure it out\", but his mind is probably racing with guilt and sorrow and he might not figure that out. So ask him to set up therapy for himself and you, tell him that is a condition of you two staying together and give him a timeline. If he doesn't do it, then walk away with your head held high.\n\nBut you also don't need to do any of that. You can absolutely walk away. This is just if you want to try to save your relationship. If YOU want. You can leave for any reason at all. With your head held high.\n\nGood luck. Feel free to PM me if you want to talk. I haven't been through your situation, but I have other experiences if you have any questions.",

Like taking the wedding ring off to go into the bar and chat up women or men while away on a business trip, \"I own a little condo in Mexico\" with no mention of the house in New Jersey with the wife in it waiting for them at home Huge.\n\nI'm sorry, but he's looking elsewhere and hasn't cut you loose yet only because he hasn't found anyone else yet who is  sure thing. But this is definitely a ticking timebomb for when he does take it beyond emotional affair into full-blow leaving you for someone else land.\n\nReally sorry, but if he had come clean on it and confessed and wanted to do couples counseling I would say stay, but he didn't do any of that.\n\nThis isn't looking good and I think you should actually accept that no matter what you do the problem isn't you in the first place. He does want to be single, he just wants to make sure there's someone else for him to be single to before he leaves you. On that note if I were you I would probably start mentally figuring out what to do next without him.\n\nAlso read your post again and please pay attention to how you've buried yourself and what you need from a relationship in focusing on what he needs. Where exactly do you fit into all of this if your partner has so little going on for themselves and in their lives that they'd rather hurt the one they love simply to get attention from a near stranger?

It was hard for ME to stop and I actually couldn't.  Like your partner, I kept insisting to mine that it was all harmless.  And in theory it was was.  I wasn''t going to do anything IRL.  BUT -- it tool all my emotional bandwidth and made my partner feel like he was in second place.\n\nWe had a bad breakup over it when he finally had enough.\n\nNow 10 years later, I've realized I had feelings I couldn''t communicate to him at the time.  It's all complicated, but I didn't get enough validation from him, I did like it from a range of people, and it was a lot of messy internal emotions.\n\nI am now in an open relationship (very commited, very happy.)  I now have the best of both worlds.  My bf and I are both allowed to get some attention//validation without a problem and we can set limits for each other.  \n\nThis might end up suiting your partner at some point (but sound like not suiting you.)\n\nAnyhow... long way to say -- he may have some complex emotions/issues that you are either ready to work with or not.

It sounds like you need to decide on your own if this is worth trying to save. It may be beyond that, idk because I'm not you. If you decide it is, then get the ball rolling ASAP and get yourself into counseling / look into alternative living situations / let your friends and family know that you're going to need extra emotional support for a little while you figure things out. If not, get the ball rolling on some couples therapy. If you're on the fence (and it sounds like you are), know that extreme self-esteem issues and self-sabotage do go hand in hand and, if this is going to be a life-long problem with him (it might), you need to consider this.

It is good to see you standing back and looking at this from a good perspective. Sometimes as a person with low self esteem we tend to feel that rush of someone taking an interest in your life.  It makes it feel like you are worth something even if you have a loving partner this outsider interest makes you feel wanted it's a boost to your own ego.  He obviously needs help and should definitely look into getting counselling. At your lowest point it can be hard to ask for help.  You know you need help and are screaming out for it but taking that first step towards help can feel like climbing a mountain.    I know you probably don't want to do this but you could help him with this.  Tell him you will go to meetings 3 him if he wants and that he has your fill support in his journey to get the help he needs. Don't push too hard,  I am glad you are both adult enough to talk through your issues but he obviously needs a little more outside help.  He should not of been taking top this girl and basically leading her on but he never seen it that way.  You are his strength and without you he may fall alot further that he even realizes. I don't say this to put pressure on you but to make you understand that if you still want to be with him that you are his rock. You need to sit him down and discuss your feelings with him about everything. (If you want this to work) reassure him you still be there for him.  That yes the feeling of an outside interest may make him feel good but that it hurting you.  Give him a specific time table and say ok you I would like you to get counselling within 6 months for example.  If he is unwilling to do so you will need to evaluate your relationship. I know personally what self esteem can do to you.  You don't see that your hurting this person you love, the rush of a new interest can make you feel high as a kite but at the end of the day you know that without your rock you would be nothing. Hopefully if he gets you can both grow from this experience. Tell him that deleting these messages makes him look guilty even if he is innocent and that he must break off contact south this girl.  He can block her from social media, he must get help and you both need to move onwards with your relationship if that's what you want.  He may require you to support him in his quest for counselling but do so with an open heart.  Remind him you love him and the reasons why you do  good luck to you both",

He knew what he was doing was wrong, it doesn\u2019t matter why he was doing it in the first place. \n\nJust because he has low self-esteem doesn\u2019t give him license to do things at your expense and open the doors to emotionally cheat with someone else.  He could find a much healthier way to make friends without having to lead someone on.

If he can't see the wealth of life he has around him and how much you care about him, then he will only continue to drag you into the morass. At the very least, if you stay with him, he needs to find a hobby to provide that rush and self worth. Make him get into Jiujitsu.",

He also seems to have the emotional maturity and integrity of a teenager. I would move on to greener pastures. At 26 years old, there are plenty of other fish in the sea.",

Some people need constant newness to get that feeling of validation. \n\nIf he's already going to therapy... I don't know how much help new therapy will be. If he doesn't suggest you go to couples therapy, I wouldn't. You can't make him try. Him saying he wants to keep you doesn't mean he wants to keep you. He has to show you. \n\nI was with a guy for almost 4 years. He started cheating on me, saying he just met some girl platonically but loved me, wanted to be with me. Going so far as to say he wanted to get married so he bought a ring, and continued to cheat on me & gave me the ring/took it back several times over the course of a year until I finally stopped listening to what he said and paid attention to what he did & I left. \n\nObviously, you have to do what feels right... But it sounds like he's using you as a crutch while he seeks new... And I hate that this is happening to anyone, because it's hard to make a decision to leave someone you still love.",

            "I\u2019m sure you have tons of comments, but I wanted to add my two cents.\n\nIt\u2019s not about overreacting or if you\u2019re wrong or right for feeling a certain way. It\u2019s just how you feel.\n\nIf he does something that makes you feel shitty, then that\u2019s the end of the sentence. You are within your right to ask him to no longer do it, or at least tell him you\u2019re not comfortable with it. It is then up to him to take it or leave it. It\u2019s not about right or wrong. It\u2019s just your boundaries. You could probably tell from the comments that what you\u2019re saying is nothing close to toxic. Toxic would be saying or doing something to harm him. So really, what he\u2019s done is toxic. \n\nPeople often refer to things related to cheating as \u201ca mistake.\u201d Regrettable is the better word, but I wouldn\u2019t call them a mistake. This isn\u2019t accidentally dropping a glass cup. He remembered the posts, he went back and looked at the posts, he thought about it for a moment, he removed your presence from the posts, he had time to think about this choice, he continued to talk to her, etc. This isn\u2019t *a mistake*. This is a series of choices. Bad ones, but conscious ones. \n\nYou never want to be with someone that needs external validation to love themselves. That is a void that will never be filled. A sinkhole to the core of the earth. Soon, she won\u2019t be enough either. She will become another reliable pillar as well or he\u2019ll grow tired of her too. Everyone loves to be complimented and loved. Being cared for and taking care of loved ones is a great joy in life. But at your baseline, you need to like yourself and even love yourself without someone telling you too. He should know his hobbies are interesting and go find people who share those hobbies. He doesn\u2019t need to share it with some pretty/random girl to feel good about it. \n\nHiding you is major. I do believe that points to greater trouble if not now, down the line.\n\nSome advice that I\u2019ve gotten from reddit that is very true: listen to the actions, not the words. I think it\u2019s great you wrote out everything in your post, because you eventually got to the point that said you wished he would take the initiative. Exactly. He hasn\u2019t, it was all you. Why? And if he did take action first, how long would it last past the initial guilt? A month? Two?\n\nLast thing I want to say. Don\u2019t let him blame this on his depression. When my ex cheated, he claimed he was depressed and that was how he handled it. Load of bs. One thing I unfortunately know, and have spent more time experiencing then I like to admit, is depression. When I was at my lowest, I watched anime, ate, and didn\u2019t talk to people. Not everyone behaves the same, I know. But depression doesn\u2019t make you do new things, and can\u2019t be blamed for these kind of actions. This is all him.",

It was some other girl I didn\u2019t know. But when I clicked on the photo, I noticed my comment was gone. And after refreshing instagram to make sure it didn\u2019t glitch, I came to the conclusion that he deleted it. A little bit later my boyfriend texted me saying we\u2019re over...  I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s gonna dump you but this is not good behavior for a relationship that\u2019s gonna last a lifetime.

            "This was beautifully written and shows that you are more than capable of expressing what you\u2019re feeling clearly and in a straightforward manner. I think that his self esteem issues might be too far away for you to even help him, if that makes sense. I used to be this partner (though I never sought validation from someone else, just my own partner) and it always drove them away. Needing that constant validation to just be happy is going to ruin this relationship. I don\u2019t think he has to be totally in love with himself to be able to love you, but I do think he needs to be much better off with himself before he can handle this relationship. You care so much about him and his feelings, but he didn\u2019t stop to think about how his actions would make you feel before he did them. He didn\u2019t feel bad about deleting the comments until he got caught. And, the first time you asked him what was wrong lied and told you that everything was fine. This is very clearly not a 50-50 relationship. You are giving so much more and receiving nothing back. I think a break would probably benefit the both of you, no matter how hard that will be.",

I would do some intense soul-searching and ask yourself if you are okay with being with him if he doesn't take the actions you want, and even if he does, are you okay with being with someone who relies on you so dependently and is so unhappy with themselves, they're willing to use other people?\nI would have a talk with him about what it is you want from him to make it up to you and to make himself better, but tell him that you aren't going to push him towards these things. If he decides not to do them, then leave. Either he improves and goes back to counseling and therapy, or you move on amicably.\nStruggling to love yourself is one thing, manipulation is another.",

He has his problems but if he loves you enough, he should be proactive to find a solution to it rather than just putting more weight on your shoulders. Cool down, think this over, tell him to take actions and win you back, let him be the one proposing new things to do, etc. Because if he is too worried about having your attention on him rather than  in another person (because you can have the so called \"rush\"too), he won't have time for another.\n\nDamn, people are all like this, never let someone have you for granted, it sucks.",

So the minute someone else shows an interest in you outside of those elements you get an adrenaline rush and the attention can become a drug.\n\nMy partner and I ended up going to a joint relationship counsellor to accurately convey our emotional states and needs to each other. Our love language. We found what each other lacked in the relationship and retuned our day to day interactions. This process took around 2 months of weekly sessions. \n\n5 years later and we have never been stronger. \n\nBest of luck x",

You cannot replace that rush of excitement and you cannot be his only source of self esteem.\n\nI\u2019m a recovering addict, and one of the quotes I remind myself of often is \u201cOur lives have only known excitement, anxiety and depression.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m not calling your SO an addict, but I think it\u2019s human nature to wrestle with these emotional states and if we\u2019re not aware, it\u2019s easily to fall into \u201creaction mode\u201d. Your SO needs to stop looking outside himself, and to others, to fix a longing that\u2019s inside of him.

And him saying it was a \"big mistake\", having deleted the messages they sent each other? Come on, that sounds extremely fishy.\n\nI think you are being way too hard on yourself and too easy on him. You aren't being controlling, not at all. On the contrary, he is acting weird and suspicious, he gave you every reason to doubt things and ask him to deactivate his accounts for a while.",

            "I honestly don't know what to tell you. I understand the feeling of loving someone and being unsure if they still love you back. The thing is do you want to keep fighting for a relationship if he's already decided to move on? As easy as it is to say \"break up with him\" it is not that easy in real life. There is still a chance for this to work out if he puts in the work too. I wish you all the luck.",

He deleted any sign on his Instagram that he is in a long term relationship. That is a BIG RED FLAG.\n\nIt doesn't matter what him and that girl have been talking about. The fact is, HE is not fully invested in y'all's relationship. He should be PROUD to let people know about his amazing girlfriend, not trying to hide her in order to get attention from some stranger half way across the world.\n\nYou are right. It's a problem only he can solve. However, he has shown it's not something he can solve while in a relationship. Only YOU will get hurt in the end. You can choose whether to give him a chance to work on himself, but I feel like you deserve someone who doesn't take you for granted and who is more stable.

            "  I'm kinda old school when it comes to the dynamics of a relationship. And in my relationship there are 3 entities...him, me, and the relationship. I believe the best relationship is the one where both parties make independent decisions that are best for the relationship, not thmeselves. With social media, it's so easy for one partner to feel guilty about asking the other partner to monitor their behavior because we're taught these days that everyone has a right to, blah, blah, blah, and we're the ones with the problem of insecurity. Point is, what he did was make a selfish decision, no matter the reason, and he did not put your relationship first. Does he ever put it first? Sometimes the question isn't \"was it right they did that\", or \"is it wrong that I feel this\", the question is, \"Am I ok that this person makes his personal needs/wants a priority over what's best for us. \n  I guess I didn't really answer the question but I want you to feel more confident in what you're thinking and feeling. It's not what's right and what's wrong it's is whether the decision was good, bad, or neutral for the relationship, IMO. \n  Good luck \u2665\ufe0f",
            "Hey OP, you're 7 years in. I can tell you my experience dating someone like your boyfriend for 1.5 years. My exbf suffered from low self esteem as well. He required constant validation from other women in his life (his exgirlfriend with a very long drawn-out breakup that morphed into FWB scenario that morphed into \"best friends\" when we started dating, a random girl living in a different state who used to hike with him, a girl who played chess against him, etc, etc). \nAnd of course, all of it was my fault because I had a full schedule with gradschool, evening language courses and was happy with a well rounded life. \n\nMy point is, even if you are a person with relatively clear boundaries and priorities in your mind, your SO's confusion/lack of self esteem/yearning for a certain \"je ne sais quoi\" will mess everything up in your head. \n\nI broke it off. It broke my heart but the relief that I didn't have to care anymore, I didn't have to feel guilty/ that I'm not good enough of a girlfriend, that was worth it. I really wanted to marry that guy. 2 years later, I don't even think about him anymore.",
            "Dump him. He already screwed whatever trust you might've built over 7 years by doing what he did. What he did might as well be cheating. It's only a matter of time before he dumps you. You're no longer interesting to him.",
            "I've read through your posts and you seem like such a nice person with a kind heart. I hope everything works out for you.",
            "This literally made me make an account just to pass comment in the hopes OP gains some solace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had a very similar scenario happen to me a few years ago. My partner and I had met online, dated almost immediately, whirlwind romance for the first year. I developed a chronic condition in this time and he was endlessly supportive. Regularly referred to me online and gave me no reason to question his fidelity. All good. \n\nWithin a month of us passing our lavish first anniversary (and Christmas/my birthday to boot) I noticed a few odd things online. He had deleted my graduation photos with pictures of the two of us. He hadn't mentioned anything about our first anniversary, just that he had gone to the cinema proverbially alone. He did the same thing on Valentine's day, no mention of me. He deleted photos of us together, even if I wasn't in them, just because we did something together. I had only previously pulled him up on some flirtatious behaviour once with an ex-colleague of his months before so this was getting very strange. He'd gone from telling everyone I existed to actively removing me from life overnight. I moved city for work (landing a dream job opportunity after months of unemployment post-graduation) but I didn't initially see this as an issue as for the first 8 months we were a LTR anyway. Moving away made all those niggles into huge f---ing potholes. Fast forward 6 months, I was 10kg lighter from stress and barely able to eat from anxiety. I had found he had an Instagram and Snapchat (I did not use these apps nor did I have ANY idea he even had an account) and portrayed a bachelor's lifestyle. Even things I did for him he somehow angled to be 'random' occurrences. I have never been a jealous person but I was actively stalking him daily, running to the toilet at work to have panic attacks 2-3 times a day. Considering this guy was going to come move in and was looking for a ring (supposedly) this was a huge shock. Eventually tracked down all the girls he was messaging on Instagram (got to love an eidetic memory) and had one of the women honey trap him. Solidarity within sisters. I needed that proof right there in front of me 'live' before I would admit to myself that this was all happening right under my nose for as far back as I could trace (initial few months of dating). In my books we were together for 18 months.   \n\n\nHe is now with a girl/woman who looks 10 years his junior who clearly has no idea what his character is like, just like I didn't. I am still hilariously bitter to this day as I was made a fool of by someone I adored. This bitterness mainly stems from the fact that his entire family have just accepted that this happened without consequence, despite meeting me afterwards to hand over his things and seeing the mess I was. There was no punishment for his cruelty and he lied to his friends (whom I never met) that we'd broken up because of distance. \n\nNow I'm in a much healthier relationship with a man who calls me on my shit. OP - dump him. He is racing for a high like an addict - even if he isn't cheating now, it won't be long till the conversational vilification isn't enough.",

He was arrogant enough to think he was smarter than you; when we choose to lie or deceive that is the choice we make. \n\nHe is also continuing to take responsibility....while still telling you all about his struggles with self esteem, his music not working, not feeling special...yes I am rolling my eyes.

It's okay if this is too much to work past. like you said - there's nothing for you to really work on. All that is going to happen with time passing is you are going to continue to think about your situation and be at least as hurt as you are now. There is no way to get over this unless he completely changes - any slight thing will make you think of this instagram fiasco again. \n\nI am a pretty cynical person so I'd find it hard to believe I happened to find out about something JUST in time that nothing happened.

            "He's trying to cheat. My ex wife did this to me twice. The first time I found out, I forgave her and we worked through it (marriage counseling).  A few years later the second was with another man across the country, she was sending inappropriate pictures and they were talking about meeting. It will escalate! Get rid of him the first time unlike me.",

I felt like telling him what to do to help me feel secure was doing all the work for him. She told me to look at it differently, I am telling him directly what I need and he is making the choice whether or not to do it. So my advice is this: tell him what would make you feel more confident, see a therapist, make an effort, etc. and see what he does. None of what he did is okay, and I'm not advocating for you staying or leaving, but he'll show you what you mean to him in the coming weeks and months. Take what he shows you and make your decision from there. And no matter what happens, you'll be okay.",

Ask yourself if this is something YOU can overcome, and if so, what do you need from him to do so (i.e. his proactive effort to fix things and show remorse vs you having to suggest it). You cant get back a moments passed, so make sure the time you still have is the most that YOU can make it. Good luck.",

I would call his actions emotionally cheating. Even if there was nothing risque between them, he still was going to her for that emotional rush. I would understand his side a little bit more if he hadn't edited those posts, but the fact that he did was a major no no. If he wants the rush of being asked those questions then he should find friends, join clubs that interest him, but instead he went about it the wrong way. \nYou're not responsible for his happiness and for pulling his weight in the relationship. If he's not doing that on his own then it is a clear sign that he does not value you. I wish you the best OP and applaud you on your communication skills with your partner as well as your dedication in your relationship.",
            "Hi! First of all, I think you handled the whole situation with a lot of grace. You gave him time to explain and you seemed pretty civil about the whole thing, so kudos to you for that!\nWhile I respect your boyfriend for coming clean, I still think his behaviour is a form of microcheating. \n\nThe rule is this (at least in my books) if you feel guilty about it - you\u2019re probably in the wrong.\n\n\nThe way you described your conversation he seemed very guilty and while he explained that he liked the initial rush (which I understand - as after 7 years in a relationship you know everything about your partner and vice versa) he should have talked about it to you.\nI honestly don\u2019t know what to do next but I don\u2019t feel that you\u2019re overreacting at all.\n\nWhether you choose to get counselling and / or try to work through this together, I wish you the best of luck!",

            "IDK, my gut tells me he\u2019s playing on your sympathy to low self esteem and depression, probably has been for years.  You say his \u201cdoctor career\u201d(sic) is going well and his  finances are in a good place, I take it he\u2019s been a starving college student racking up some/much debt, this sounds too good to be true for a depressed 28 year old with low self esteem.  His \u201cmusic\u201d can\u2019t possibly be something he actually thought he\u2019d have time for at this point, my guess is it\u2019s just another card he\u2019s using to play on your emotional generosity which just happens to come with easy sex and some if his expenses paid.  \n\nBut then I wonder if some of his \u201cinsecurities\u201d are your projection.  You sound like you\u2019ve been successful getting help you need (that\u2019s not easy)and your expectations of his desire doesn\u2019t seem wrong to me. \n\nBut at this point I\u2019d  get my ducks lined up for my independence while simultaneously seeing what he does with no more relationship ship related requests from me.

            "I want to say first that under these circumstances it isn't toxic to ask someone to get off of social media if they're doing things that are damaging to your relationship. I think it's best that he doesn't use social media for now because it's a form of self-medicating, rather than seeking validation and help from a therapist you're seeking validation through attention/flirting. Just my opinion but I think social media used that way is toxic.\n\nI know you mentioned that you both seem to pick up the slack when one of you needs it, but what would you say the ratio of that is? When is the last time he did? I'm asking because I couldn't help but wonder if he has started taking advantage of your readiness to carry the weight of the relationship, because that could be why he isn't showing any signs of bothering to help himself. Maybe he's gotten used to you holding his hand the whole way. \n\nI know you don't want to have to spell it out for him, I don't blame you it must be emotionally exhausting to deal with this. But maybe you should explain that you're feeling that his personal issues are straining the relationship, to the point that he is seeking attention from strangers while hiding that he's with you. That isn't something that you should have to deal with, of course we should stand by our loved ones when things are hard, but when they start turning to someone else that crosses a line. Explain this, only once, and add that it's up to him to get the help he needs and find the motivation at this point. Then let him find his way. If he doesn't then it won't get better, because no matter what you do he can only make change if he wants to.\n\nI really hope that if you do decide to go this route that he realizes that he's been relying on you too much and needs to do this himself. Good luck to you both.",
            "Emotional cheating is just as much cheating as physical. He wanted something from this girl and it was enough to hurt you. \n\nI think the biggest question here is if you think you can forgive him. Are you really happy with him. I don't know how I would feel after something like that. Maybe take a friend and go away for a weekend and think about thinks.\n\nI think you need time away from him to really make a decision because when you're right there with him it's going to break your heart. Either way I wish you the best and just know that this wasn't about you. Personally I think you deserve better. But I know that it's not easy to just give up 7 years.  I wish you luck.",
            "Wow. Reading all of that I'm surprised at how self aware you guys are about your feelings and thoughts. You can be rational but also feel emotions, I'm usually at the extremes so it's very beautiful and inspiring to read your thoughts.\n\n I think what you are feeling is absolutely valid. Some people would say you're exaggerating but when it comes to feelings, people have the right to feel whatever they do, it's valid and doesn't need justification, specially if you have given them as much thought as you did. I would feel the same, because it's only logical to feel you're not enough when he needs something or someone else to feel good. Its a difficult situation because, like you said, his thoughts are something you can empathize with. But that doesn't mean you deserve the consecuences. I don't know what I could tell you cause you seem to have reflected enough about it and what's left to do is from your partner to turn his words into actions.\n\nI know you would prefer he did it by himself but I think if you told him what you wrote here, that you would feel better if he proved he really wants to change or do something about it. Don't tell him examples or what to do, just say you need more than words to rebuild the trust. Hope you guys can figure this out.",

            "You are not responsible for anyone else\u2019s mental health. I learned this the hard way, but you don\u2019t have to. I met the former \u201clove of my life\u201d while I was an undergrad and he was in grad school. He was perpetually depressed, suffered from low self esteem, and had a habit of living in the past. If it weren\u2019t for me he wouldn\u2019t have finished his masters degree. Eventually I moved from CA to PA to be with him. He had found his dream job (with a hard nudge/shove from me) and was feeling better about himself. He was in a management position in charge of a team of young, idealistic undergrads who adored him. He was finally standing on his own, and then he realized he didn\u2019t want me standing next to him anymore. He\u2019d started a relationship with one of his young colleagues. She was young, and everything that I wasn\u2019t, or rather everything he\u2019d told me he\u2019d prefer I not be (edgy, tattooed, chainsmoker with a potty mouth and a bad attitude, weirdly now that I\u2019m free I have all of that except the attitude and the smoking). She read all of the books he gave her, she shared his ideals... (he forgot that I did too, and had since the beginning). He told me that she made him feel things he didn\u2019t feel about me anymore. She was new and exciting. I was comfortable. He told me that he loved me and I could stay if I wanted but he wanted to pursue something with her. I chose to leave. She dumped him almost immediately when the excitement of being with an older, spoken for man wore off and he ended up right back in the depressive hole I\u2019d spent 4 years pulling him out of. I\u2019m not saying that you should break up, but you need to lay all of your cards out and find out what you each want and where you see yourself in the future. He definitely needs to learn to build himself up instead of relying on you or the new girl for affirmation.",
            "He\u2019s been fostering an emotional affair. If his intentions are truly platonic then he has no reason to hide your relationship from this girl, nor to delete some of their communication.",

            "You are definitely not being unreasonable!

I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years, and although I think I miss that \"rush\" more than he does, I've never actively sought it out because I know it would do irreparable damage to our relationship. \n\nBottom Line: You need to trust each other, and it sounds like you can't trust him! He's doing these things to get attention from people who AREN'T YOU. You sound like a really caring person and it seems as if he's taking advantage of that. If he can't treat you like you're enough for him, I would leave. I'm so sorry you're going through this!",

He has a LOT, I mean a lot of growing up to do and it's going to be up to you whether or not you feel like pulling the majority of the weight in this relationship , waiting, hoping he catches up with you.\n\nI don't see his actions so much in the light of deceit, being a cheater,etc as I get the feeling that he's just very childlike emotionally. He hasn't developed a strong sense of self or of confidence (and tbf, at nearly 30 , this is abnormal), he needs instant gratification and is emotionally high maintenance, he also has what seems like a juvenile understanding of commitment at best.\n\nHonestly, if you love him though, you love him. However, I wouldn't put all my eggs in his basket, so to speak. I'd suggest shoaling up your support system and looking into alternative housing plans should it become too much. So, if you love him and want to stay, then go for it, but make sure you are looking out for yourself by developing a plan b.",
            "Whether he does have actual interest in this girl, which is very likely, or not, he is not emotionally ready to be in a relationship. If he feels the need to erase your relationship of 7 years  to get attention from a random girl, he has a whole level of self help to work on. I get it. You feel guilty or obligated to support him or understand/justify his actions because of his self esteem issues. I\u2019ve been there and let someone do so much awful things to me because of that empathy. But it\u2019s not your responsibility. He needs help and he should not be in a relationship.

This was premeditated, deliberate action to manipulate both you and this person who has no idea of the kind of person she is *really* talking to. I think if she understood things from your perspective she'd be just as angry for you as everyone here. He is *using* people, and that's not fair.

            "I actually have had a very similar experience with a previous boyfriend who was also a doctor. He also had issues and saw therapists and took medication. While we had a great relationship, and got along so well, I found out he was messaging other women. It was seemingly platonic, never trying to actually meet up or initiate an affair, but still somewhat romantic. He explained the same thing about the \u201crush\u201d of meeting someone new, but he didn\u2019t want to break up or be single. After some thought, and conversations of really what he was getting was a type of validation that I no longer give. Stemming from previous issues in his life, that rush of validation of a woman being interested in him really had nothing to do with me, but his insecurities being fed in an unhealthy way. But, by doing this he is creating a detachment from you, but still wants you to stay because you feed a different validation. In the end, he is quite selfish, and wants to be able to keep all of these unhealthy validations to ease his insecurities. Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have gone through the lengths of hiding you from his Instagram. It\u2019s almost compulsive, and he will continue to seek these \u201crushes\u201d. Even though they are seemingly harmless, it really is a much bigger issue that will most likely be hard for him to overcome. I was unable to work through it with him, because of the detachment it created, and also I felt used. He wanted me to keep being his girlfriend, but I knew it was only because of what it meant to his insecurities, not because he actually loves me.",

And it was really hard to move past and I honestly couldn't have if my partner hadn't completely turned around his actions and been completely transparent with me moving forward. While everyone on here is right, he lied and betrayed you. So now you have to decide if you can live with that. I just wanted to give you a scenario in which it could work.",
            "Hello friend! I looked at your post history, you have a long history of helping others through tough situations and freely giving care and concern to people you don't even know to try and make their life better. You really care about people and helping those people, and so I imagine that when you are facing this obstacle with the person you care the most about, it might be really hard for you to focus on you instead of trying to help him.\n\nThe important thing to remember here is you are the victim. He may be fighting battles of his own with depression or self esteem, but that does not give him the right within a long term committed relationship to victimize you. It especially doesn't give him the right to brush it off as no big deal, just a friend asking about his favorite things. It extremely doesn't give him the right to hide that you exist so that someone else can inflate his own ego or self confidence. \n\nYou're completely validated in feeling like the person you put everything into, should put their all back into you. You should be taking care of one another instead of you just taking care of him. You should decide not just what kind of relationship you want going forward, but what kind of life. You got together young, people change and he may have changed in a way that's no longer compatible with you. \n\nHe may also just not understand who he is after changing. He may completely intend to not want to be single, but it doesn't mean that is what's best based on his actions.\n\nThere are no answers here, that's for you to determine, but I do hope you take care of yourself first and know regardless of how it turns out that you can and will be ok, even if it's scary.",

            "In my view he is disrespectful of you and I'm wondering why are you continuing to this and why you're still there. Being an adult that values being in a committed relationship and respectful of their partner means that you deal with the challenges of the relationship with an end goal in mind. You don't set up yourself to be enticed. He's selfish and disrespectful, and maybe immature. He's not ready for a commitment.  Move on and save yourself future heartaches.",
            "At risk of sounding like a cynical asshole, my opinion when I got through all the main points here is that it seemed like he was using your relationship as a placeholder in case something else comes up (i.e. new girl, new relationship), and is getting used to his new position in life (being a doctor, finances, etc.) and all that comes with that. That's my opinion of the worst case scenario.\n\nLess cynically, he might be reaching out for new relationships in the forms of the new friends, or platonic flirting, if that's a thing. This could be seen as healthy in the same way that you enjoy finding different hobbies to talk about with each other. He could then bring this newly found energy to you the next time you feel an ebb.\n\nEnd of the day, I'm just a random person on the internet who felt like sharing my opinion so take with much salt!

People tend to think of their partners when in comes to relationship when all that matter is your perspective. Do your part and if they don\u2019t reciprocate then you know better then. If you stayed honest and loyal then expect the same. If they fail to do so then express yourself, your disappointment. Let the person who does you wrong exert effort to make things right.

You wrote: \" He deserves to love himself, but not at the expense of the love we have  between us. I deserve love that is stable and comforting, and not laced  with newfound paranoia. \"\n\nFirst of all, I absolutely 100% agree with your second sentence, about what YOU deserve. However, I have to disagree with your first one. Yes, your partner does deserve to love himself, EVEN at the expense of his current relationship. Denying him that in order to save the relationship for yourself is toxic. That being said, if his actions hurt you, you have every right to feel hurt and make your own decision about whether you want to stay with him under those circumstances or not.\n\nI wish you all the best for finding the right decision for yourself, and for finding happiness. Just please do not try to force someone to change for you who doesn't want to change (also, don't hang on in the hopes of change if he shows no signs of actively trying to change--words don't count if they're not followed through on).",

Need advice!\n\nSo my girlfriend and I have been together for about two years. We have a great emotional and mental bond and get along wonderfully. I realized that for me, the sexual chemistry was really low from the beginning. I thought we could work on that and that it would come with time. Unfortunately it did not and it breaks my heart... We have sex somewhat regularly but usually I'd rather just cuddle and watch a movie or do something else with her. Even things I loved doing with previous partner rather turns me off with her. I can't even go down on her because the taste is irritating and that was something I loved to do.\n\nAs hard as it is, I feel like she deserves someone who's as much into her as she is into me. I don't want to end up in a long term relationship where both of us are unsatisfied with our sex life, even if all other domains are well. I feel like I can't give her what she wants and needs.\n\nThe thought of breaking up will probably already hurt her very much. She's planning a future with me and talks constantly about moving in together, starting a family etc. I'm afraid that telling her that the sexual chemistry does not work for me will shred her self-esteem and I really want to prevent this. I think my girlfriend is wonderful and beautiful but it somehow doesn't work for me sexually. I had flings with girls which were way below here judging by the looks with which the chemistry was not an issue. So how can I explain this to my girlfriend without completely devastating her? I really hope for some advice!\n\nEdit: Holy... This blew up way more than I thought. I will try to answer as many questions as possible.  \nSo, some clarifications: I am not 100% sure yet if a break-up is the way to go. If it is, I have not accepted it yet just now. I will therefore talk to some people in my support net and try to get some time to think on my own.   \nPeople thinking I have not tried working on this: I did. She realised that I am reluctant to sex sometimes. We tried to spice things up with toys, different places, etc. I cut down on self-enjoyment. Hell I am open to seeing a therapist. However, I am not sure if any of these things can affect the sexual chemistry.   \nAnyway, I will try to make up my mind as soon as possible and let her know as soon as this happend.   \nThank you all for your advice! It is really appreciated.",

            "I was kind of at the receiving end of this recently, even though I was the more enthusiastic sexual partner and my ex was lower libido.

It hurt like hell, but that was the point I also ended the relationship on.\n\nAfter breaking up I realised I could finally be free of insecurity, as him losing attraction to me was *his* issue, not mine. I just need to find someone who finds me attractive as I am. I can also now find someone who is sexually compatible with me!\n\nJust do it sooner rather than later.",

            "I have been told by an ex explicitly that our sexual chemistry was bad and off and was given way too much info about what he disliked about me and what he liked about other women. It's so not necessary and it will be hurtful for no reason. It is completely reasonable to just say that the relationship isn't working for you. It's not okay for your partner to try and negotiate out of a break up. It's disrespectful and it's a violation, so if this happens you do not owe her more of an explanation.",
            "There is no \"nice\" way to break up. You just gotta rip the band-aid off and do it. Have you ever talked to your gf about your issues with the sex before? \n\nWhen you break up, you can say as much or as little as you want about why you're breaking up. If you don't feel comfortable getting into the specifics, then saying something like \"the relationship wasn't working for me and I'm ending it\" is all you need to really say.",

            "My experience is, sex can be improved, but physical chemistry can't. Attraction is a \nweirdly random element and you can't make it be where it isn't. My experience is also that it's not a good idea to date people who are much more  attached to you than you are to them.\n\nShe deserves all the honesty and kindness that your most valued friend would. There's something missing from your relationship. She knows that already. I was finally able to see my ex husband clearly when he said to me, \"Sex just isn't important to me. It's like scratching my butt.\" He wasn't just placating me, he's genuinely a low libido person. It helped me let go of the idea that we were ever going to have the kind of relationship I wanted.",
            "Exactly what do you mean with sexual chemistry?

            "I have a question that needs answering before I can go further. \n\nAt the beginning, you said the sex wasn't good but you thought you could work on that. By the end of your post you're asking how to tell her there's no sexual chemistry and you probably need to break up.\n\nYou see my problem? If you guys have been working on your sexual chemistry, wouldn't she already know it's not working? What \"work\" did you do?\n\nOnly two possibilities I can think of. One, you never did work on it, or two, you worked on it but didn't tell her, hoping to guide her to the right answer. Both of these possibilities are unsatisfactory. \n\nYou can't work on a problem as serious as this without her involvement. And if she really was unaware, you're asking how to drop a bomb on her head without crushing her. Bombs on the head crush. No way around it. If you're asking for some smooth talk to make this easy on you, well, some ways are better than others, and we can get into that, but I'd sure like to have the answer to my original questions: what work did you do, and was she involved?\n\nLook forward to your reply.

            "Is there anything she can do to make the sexual chemistry better for you?",
            "Well, then you'll have to simply have fallen out of love with her. That's one of those tricky things that can just happen and it sucks but there's nothing to do. There's nothing wrong with her, but your feelings just aren't there. That's what you tell her. The sex issues are because your feelings are gone, you can tell her, rather than the other way around.\n\nAnd good on you for not wanting to mess her future sex life up.",
            "So as I'm reading this, she is often initiating and you aren't feeling it? So it's not a matter of her not wanting sex. Has it always been this way or has something about her changed? Has she altered her appearance/gained weight/changed her diet so that her body chemistry is off etc? It's ok to not be attracted to her anymore or does she not do what you prefer? \n\nI agree with you, that if everything else is going well, she is going to want to know what is up.\n\nIt's unfortunate you have let it get this far into a relationship, unless this is a new issue?",
            ">We have sex somewhat regularly but usually I'd rather just cuddle and watch a movie or do something else with her. Even things I loved doing with previous partner rather turns me off with her. I can't even go down on her because the taste is irritating and that was something I loved to do.\n\nThis is not something you can force and it's too bad you let it carry on for so long. My dude, I declined second dates with men who didn't smell right when I hugged them after a first date. You should not even try to carry on with someone whose smell or taste irritates you or is repellant to you.\n\nIf someone doesn't smell or taste good to you things simply won't work, that's how important smell/taste is to good sexual chemistry. This doesn't mean, however, that the person smells bad, but rather that they don't smell right or good to *you*. But no matter how you phrase it she's going to take is as a personal flaw against herself, so it's better not to mention this specifically. Just say that you don't feel chemistry with her to the extent that you'd rather cuddle or watch a movie rather than sex and that's not fair to her or you, and you don't want to waste any more of her time.",

You needn't give her the total truth because that won't help anything. You're breaking up because you feel incompatible. Say that and be clear. I got a vague explanation and after 3 months, I sill feel like I don't really know why it ended. So be clear in your explanation, it'll be easier for her.",
            "Why ruin a particular relationship because you\u2019re not into sex as much? \n\nSure it\u2019s different with flings. They\u2019re flings.

That\u2019s crazy. \n\nYou have sex cause you enjoy and love that person. \n\nWhat it seems to me is you view her more as a friend than as a partner which is turning you off from sex. You love her sure and care about her but the intimacy you want with a partner just faded away. Which is natural. \n\nSo if that\u2019s the case you don\u2019t even need to touch the sex chemistry because a relationship shouldn\u2019t ever die by the sword of sex alone. There\u2019s always a reason why sex with someone you\u2019re with isn\u2019t what it used to be. \n\nEither way the break up nuclear option is going to hurt no matter what. Stop trying to be a hero about it. If you\u2019re considering breaking up over lack of sexual chemistry than that reaffirms my belief you just don\u2019t see her as a partner and you\u2019re looking for a cop out excuse for it. There isn\u2019t. \n\nIt\u2019s better to be hated for being honest than being a liar. So if that\u2019s what you want you owe it not to waste their time.",
            "Ick, this is so messy and I feel for both of you. I once had an ex of an only 8 month relationship break up with me and the reason he gave me was that I sucked in bed. I don't think that's true, but it's stuck with me the past several years. So if you do end up breaking up, choose your words carefully and place more emphasis on the fact that you both physically deserve more. Let it come from a place of wanting different things physically and not that there is anything wrong with her. It's going to devastate her either way but just... Choose your words so carefully so she doesn't end up with several years of self esteem issues.",
            "I don't mean to condescend to you, but if sexual chemistry is literally the only issue that you need to fix there might be options you haven't explored. You mention things you used to love doing with a former partner turn you off with your current one. But what about exploring things that you either didn't like with previous partners or haven't even tried yet? How about going to a sex shop together? Etc. You also mentioned going down on your girlfriend - you could use flavored lube to change the taste if that's an issue. And so on.\n\nTo me, the fact that sexual chemistry is off and everything is is great (per your description), the issue seems likely to be a deeper intimacy or communication in nature. My advice for ending things in this case is to just tell her the truth. Honesty is the best policy. Tell her she's a great woman who you just don't click with in the right ways. You don't need to say more than that. \n\nBe gentle, tell her you love her, but that it's just not going to work out. Get it over with as respectfully but amicably as you can.",
            "Why go into detail at all though?",
            "You can have an \"it's not you it's me\" conversation which won't shred her self-esteem but also won't lead her to believe you are going to change your mind or anything to that effect.\n\nYou sit her down and tell her that you find yourself being attracted to other people; and wondering what it would be like. You don't want to cheat and yet these thoughts are leading to a lot of discontent. You would feel more comfortable being single, and if possible, remaining friends at some point in the future. \n\nTell her that you honestly feel like she deserves to be with someone who doesn't fantasise about anyone else but her, and therefore you love her too much to hang on to her (no matter how comfortable the relationship) when you are taking up her attention that should better be spent on someone who more adequately returns it.",

            "Seriously, this is the best example of a genuine \"it's not you, it's me.\" You love her, she loves you, but this issue isn't working out and it's not a small or shallow thing. For one, it seems like it's changed things for you where you love her more like a friend than someone you want to build a life with, even though you seem to feel like you could because she's great. But she deserves someone who wants her passionately (at least sometimes), but you just can't be that someone \n\nIt will hurt. Almost every breakup does. Don't drag it out. Be clear that it's over and she deserves someone who loves her and wants her the way she deserves. You can't make yourself feel what you don't feel - you love her, but not like that, not really, and you can't change that.",
            "Sorry to hear about what you're going through, it sounds hard. \n\nYou have an avoidant attachment style. You will always find something in your partner (no matter who they are) and think there is an ideal partner that's better out there. You are  focusing on things you dislike to emotionally distance yourself. It's not necessarily your fault because you can't control these things if you're not aware, but it can be changed.

Because that's fixable and it happens to every woman at some point. The sexual chemistry is a different story but you need to understand that you can't protect her feelings during a breakup. I like the idea of a nice peaceful breakup where both parties involved are mature and don't throw a fit, but that's rarely the case. You just have to do it and hope for the best for her feelings because you're going to hurt them, there's no getting around that. Definitely don't be a jerk and be civil about it, that's the best you can do.",
            "I don't wannabe that guy, but it seems to me that you are the problem. Granted, that is a chemistry issue, regardless of who the main source of it is. But I just wanna be clear here that if you want to fix this, you need to work on yourself, but it sounds like it just will not happen. You want her as a friend is my interpretation. It's a real shame too, because she seems to be far more into you than you are into her. \n\nYou might be damaging her self esteem by breaking up with her, but that implies that she is the problem. I think she just needs someone who will give her the proper love. It doesn't always click, and you don't have to feel bad about that, but my main point is that her self esteem is the barely the tip of the iceberg. You will break her heart. Be honest with her, but please do not frame it as her being the problem, because she isn't. It's the way you see her.",

It could be you or the combination of you and her, and it's nothing about her specifically. The ephemeral quality you want just doesn't exist and that's all that you know about it. Don't start shredding her ego by saying she tastes bad, is annoying, is overweight, or whatever the reasons you think might be the source of the poor chemistry. \n\nSecond point is that it's not going to get better. I've had a bunch of relationships and I find that sexual chemistry might get better for the first few weeks or months but after that it stays the same if you're lucky or it goes downhill. After two years the sexual chemistry is what it is. If it's bad for you it will be bad for you in a year or in ten years. Better to break up now while you two are still young rather than wasting more of your prime years. They go by fast and never come back.",
            "What exactly is not good chemistry with you and her. I just dumped my boyfriend because he\u2019s very shelfish sexually. Not all the time, but a lot. If I\u2019m with a man, and he gets off, and doesn\u2019t care about me bye bye time. I did love him, but if you\u2019re not happy, you\u2019re not.",
            "Honestly, sometimes the chemistry's just not there--especially with the off-putting taste thing. I was in a LTR where my SO's body odor made my stomach turn. Not a hygiene issue, just my pheromones and his pheromones didn't agree. And I just kind of put up with it because we got along so great emotionally. But the sex never got good. It was always clunky and awkward and just fine at best. Even when we both came, it was never fully satisfying. Just going through the motions. It was like our bodies couldn't communicate with each other if that makes sense. We dated for 5 years and tried everything, and it honestly never got better. We ultimately just stopped having sex and then finally broke up. I don't know how to help you break the news to her, because I was ultimately never able to--we ended up breaking up for other reasons--but I do think it might be better to just rip the bandaid off now.",
            "Hey man--I don't have any great advice to offer, myself. But I wanted to drop a comment to let you know that I just recently experienced this with a girl I was dating for about three months. I loved spending time with her, she was gorgeous, and I really enjoyed laying around with her and being affectionate--but whenever things started getting sexual...that part of my brain/body just wouldn't rev up. It was really tough to figure out considering how much I generally liked her and connected with her, and I spent a good period of time feeling ashamed and thinking something was wrong with me physically until I eventually realized these situations are just out of our control. \n\nThe emotional chemistry can be there, the social chemistry can be there, and then the romantic/sexual chemistry can be absent for whatever reason. It is what it is. I think it's great that you're trying to be so considerate of her and her feelings, but you need to realize that she very likely knows that something's up. In fact, she may be talking about moving in and advancing things with hopes of fixing things between the two of you. The kindest thing you can do for her is to rip the band-aid off, maybe make it as simple as \"I want to be considerate of your feelings: I don't think we're as compatible as we'd hoped\". And then give her the space she needs to move on and heal. Maybe you two can still hold a friendship down the road, maybe not. But she's in a really hurtful place right now, and you're the only one who can help alleviate that.  Best of luck to you.",
            "You sound like you\u2019re judging yourself. Like, you doubt that sexual connection is a good enough reason the end things. I think you have to come to peace with your reasons before you\u2019ll be comfortable communicating them with her. \n\nFact is, if it\u2019s important to you, it\u2019s important. Who wants to start a long-term relationship by denying an important part of who they are? You really think that\u2019s a loving thing to do to her? Giving her two thirds of yourself? \n\nBe as honest as you want, but at the end of the day, you\u2019re going to have to get comfortable standing up for your own feelings with yourself if you\u2019re ever going to have the confidence to communicate them with her.",
            "If you are not attracted to her you need to break up with her. Full stop.",
            "Have you thought of visiting a therapist together? Therapists are there to make aspects of relationships better, right? Most couples think of fixing the emotional facet of their relationship, or their communicating skills. That's only one small part that makes up a complex relationship. As you said, you guys have a great relationship other wise, maybe seeing a therapist would help you with the physical intimacy facet of your relationship, or help with your sexual skills. Having a well rounded relationship is important!",
            "i wouldnt bring this up.  make up some other bull shit \"its not you its me reason.\" and move on and dont talk to her again.  its actually the nicest thing you can do when faced with a round robin of dickish options.",
            "OP, in a comment you said you met someone else that you're attracted to. You'll probably go for this girl once you break up. She is going to compare herself to her. There is nothing you can do other than be less selfish and end things quickly and stop wasting her time",
            "Don't worry about her self-esteem, just tell her the truth. Once she knows what your issue is, she'll happily relieve you of your relationship.",
            "I hope to God you are not my boyfriend right now. Certain things you said are accurate but THIS ISSUE WOULD BE NEWS TO ME. Please please talk to your girlfriend before you break up over it right away. Talk first (see what she has to say) before you make your decision. And please don\u2019t be my boyfriend -.-",
            "When I was broken up with the nicest thing I was ever told was the one that went straight to the point without adding any \"why\" to it. A simple, \"I have come to realize this relationship is not working for me and I don't want to waste your time, because you deserve someone who is all in. And that someone isn't me.\" Then he left, I cried because come on no one can do a breakup that leaves people smiling - that's just nuts to think one could even - and he didn't stay in touch or try to ease anything or be \"friends\" or any of that. \n\nAt first I was like, \"How can he be so cold,\" but around week 2 I realize he'd actually been so much nicer than the one who wanted to be \"friends\" and kept me on the hook for months unable to move on fully. I got over it a lot faster, because there just was no hope or ambigouity or any of the \"I can fix this\" that I had experienced in other breakups.",
            "I can't be the only one thinking OP is literally too cowardly to open up about this to his GF and would rather leave the relationship than try to work on it. \"Thinking it will come with time\" is not really trying to make things improve. Yeah maybe you're right and your sexual chemistry doesn't work. But dude, for two fucking years you've kept this up? Maybe you should actually try to work on it instead of whimpering on Reddit tbh. That being said, if you really don't feel like working on it, you should leave rather than waste her time anymore. Honest, this just feels sad. \n\nAlso, it honestly seems like the sexual chemistry issue is more on your end, why do you think it'll shred her? Has she shown insecurities about this issue before?",
            "\"Hey X, I need to talk to you. So, I think we should break up. I just don't feel like this relationship is making either of us as happy as we deserve. I feel like there's some areas that we just aren't as compatible as a couple should be. I think this is what's best for us both. The last thing I want is to hurt you, and I'm sorry for that, but I think we'll both be happier this way.\" \n\nThat's how I'd do it, honestly. Just be honest, blunt, but not unnecessarily harsh.",
            "I would just tell her that you don\u2019t feel compatible with her and leave it at that. Maybe lie and say you realized you have different life goals.\n\nDon\u2019t try to stay friends with her. Go no contact.",
            "There isn't a nice way to break up with anyone.  Just tell her that the relationship wasn't working out.  And spare her the details because they will hurt her even more.",
            "Chemistry is a weird factor in relationships that most people don't actively think about but exists. You can be mentally attracted to someone, even visually attracted to them, but have zero chemistry with them. Something in our monkey brains gets activated when we have good chemistry with someone. It could be pheromones or scent or just the way their skin feels, but some people activate it and some people don't. It's not something you can learn or change. \n\nYou're not a bad person for feeling like this. It's primal, biological and part of our basic mating instincts. If you explain it to her like this, I don't think it would be too harsh. Tell her you think she's wonderful and beautiful, but you just don't have that weird thing that neither of you can control. \n\nAnd, to be honest, it may be a blow to her to hear this, but it's much worse for her in the long run if you stay and constantly subtly reject her sexually. That will lay a huge toll on her self esteem. It's best to end it before you shred her like that. As the saying goes, you have to be cruel to be kind.",
            "I had an ex in your shoes. He hated the way I tasted, he told me sex was a chore. We dragged out the break up over 6 months. We hashed out every possible option. Dont do this op. Idk how many assets you share, but if it's few and you can afford to move out tomorrow, I would.",
            "You absolutely need to break up with her and you should probably not share the specific details of why. I have been in your shoes and spent 2 years dating a guy I didn\u2019t have good chemistry with. And it is literally a chemistry thing\u2014he didn\u2019t smell good to me and the attraction I had towards him felt...hypothetical? He was objectively more attractive than men I\u2019ve slept with and had chemistry with but I never felt the actual pull of sexual attraction towards him. \n\nEveryone telling you this is a question of trying harder/being more creative/etc. has never been in this situation. Those things work when it\u2019s someone you have chemistry with and have gotten bored or stuck in a rut. But when it\u2019s fundamentally not there I really don\u2019t think you can force it. \n\nThere is no need to tell your stbx that her smell or taste is off. It is a compatibility thing, nothing she can change. Tell her you love her very much but you don\u2019t think you\u2019re compatible as long term partners. And if she digs deeper, tell her that in spite of the effort you\u2019ve both been putting in to having a rich romantic relationship, the passion just isn\u2019t there, not because of anything wrong with either of you, you\u2019re just not compatible. And then cut contact. Yes she will be devastated but she\u2019ll move on, and at some level she already knows this is an issue and is upset about it. Do her a favor and get out of her way so she can meet the guy she really is compatible with\u2014and let yourself do the same. \n\nThe guy I dumped over this is now engaged and looks super happy with his fianc\u00e9e. And I\u2019m married too. You\u2019re both gonna get through this just fine.",
            "Against the grain here I think you should talk with her and start at square one. Sounds like she has never heard a lot of this, and if she has maybe she doesn't completely understand. Fight it out, if the fight goes up in flames with neither of you conceding any grounds to each other nothing will improve after if you feel like there is still more there to explore and she does too that's a good sign for the relationship. \n\nHonest question, do you feel resentful? Because maybe the reason you don't want to do things with her is because you are resenting her for other parts of sex that are meeting your needs. \n\nAs a final thing to maybe help you guys download and app called kindu for couples, it's basically tinder for couples. Buy the kinky pack, and buy the date pack each a dollar and both of you do them. Maybe you'll find that you two just don't have direction.",
            "I (F) think that you can explain it to her almost in the same way in which you explained it here. Tell her she\u2019s amazing in many ways, tell her what you like about her, but that you\u2019re just not feeling it and that you wished you did. That you\u2019ll lose a great girl, but you think it\u2019s better to end it as you can\u2019t change what you feel. For the sake of her self-esteem I would talk about chemistry but not about sexual chemistry. Even with the knowledge that it is due to compatibility/chemistry and not my fault, I\u2019d feel super bad if my bf told me (or if I figured out) that the reason of a break up is sexual. It\u2019s great that you think about the best way to tell her and that you\u2019ve tried to work on it. Good luck :)",
            "If you have a great emotional and mental bond as a foundation, don't you think that you two could work on the sex part.  Seems like you have the most difficult part of a relationship working.  Sex is part of a relationship, but not the most important part.",
            "Probably contrary to most commenters here.....\n\nI\u2019m curious why you think a breakup is your only recourse. Have you ever been to a sex shop / toy store? There are a million and one ways to have sexy time with her. Everything from foreplay to PtoV. Get her a vibrator, nibble her neck while using it, etc etc. It sounds to me like you aren\u2019t putting in the effort to bridge this gap to make it comfortable and fulfilling for both of you. \nDon\u2019t like going down on her because of taste? They make an edible lube for that. Use toys if that\u2019s still off the table. \n\nProbably the most important part of sexy time is aftercare. When you guys are finished with whatever sex you had, go cuddle. Always go cuddle. It seems to be the most rewarding aspect for you as well.\n\nIf this is literally the only reason you\u2019re considering breaking up, I would take a breath and see if you can\u2019t put in more effort. \n\nGood luck!",
            "I had to let a guy go over this. We loved each other tremendously and found everything pretty much worked but the physical. Eventually I open heartedly just told him how much I sincerely cared for him, but that I couldn't change that I didn't feel a strong sexual attraction to him and that it wasn't fair to him or to me.  I remember saying something like: you deserve to be with a woman who is going to rip your pants off when you get home.  \n\nRegardless it wasn't easy and sometimes a floating memory still aches that it was something as \"simple\" as physical attractiveness that held a potentially amazing relationship together. Sometimes I still wish we could figure it out, but it's just someting that doesn't change.   Sorry OP, this is not easy and I commend you for taking it seriously. I can tell you care about her.",
            "2 years ? Isn't sexual chemistry something that is obvious instantly ? Regardless, you need to tell her what you've told us. She'll get over it.",
            "Hon this isn't hard, just don't say \"you're bad at sex.\" Because she's not, you just don't feel the vibe. That's fine. Say this. \"You are amazing. But I'm not in love with you. I know this is shit. I really want you to be happy and I can't give you what you deserve. I'm so sorry. I don't want to hurt you but I also don't want to lie. If in six months or so you want to be friends, I'm here. But if you never want to speak to me again, I understand.\" And that is it. Just go. Don't act like this is her fault in any way. There are guys out there who will love going down on her. So don't make her feel insecure about her smell--that's a you thing. Just rip off the bandaid so the both of you can get on to finding the person who fits best.",
            "So in two years time you haven\u2019t gone down on her hardly and avoid sex with her? Now she is planning her future with you at almost 30 years old, and you\u2019re not sure about a breakup? You can\u2019t force these things. \n\nHonestly, spend the next week or two sorting your shit out, and then make a decision. It would be horrible if you put in another two years and then decide you wish you had left sooner because now she\u2019s in her thirties wanting marriage and kids.",
            "I think you\u2019ve gotten some great advice here and if you genuinely just aren\u2019t into her sexually... yes, let her go, and soon. You can\u2019t stop it from hurting. \n\n\nI\u2019m curious about your relationship with women and sex, though. You mention chemistry with less attractive women, etc... just wondering if perhaps your brain is wired to not feel intense sexual attraction to a woman you see as \u201cpartner material\u201d? It\u2019s just something I\u2019ve come across\u2014 some guys have an ingrained Madonna/whore complex and find it hard to sexualize a woman they see as a potential wife or mother of their children. \n\nJust something to consider because it sounds like you really love her. Sex is critical in a relationship and I don\u2019t think dragging it out is a good thing, but if what I described might be the case therapy could work.",
            "As someone who is often the YOU in this equation: THERAPY. Trust me. Lots of things in previous relationships would have worked much better then if I'd even been *aware* of what my sex issues were.",
            "If I were her, I would prefer that you be honest about it. It would be worse for her self-esteem to beat herself up over never knowing what she did wrong or why it didn't work and it could become messy- aka her pining for you back bc she thinks she can make it work. You sound like a good person and I'm sure she knows that, and you both deserve a clean break. I would word it similarly to the way you did here- that she is a wonderful person and you truly want the best for her, you just don't feel sexually compatible and don't want to waste her time staying with you when you know deep down there isn't a future, when she could be out there finding someone who is right for her. Yes, it's an awkward conversation and yes, it may hurt her, but if you tell her all the good things about her too, that might help self-esteem a little. It's not either of your faults if the chemistry isn't there, and from your comments below about her asking about sex, it seems like she already knows how you feel.",
            "Why dont you just be honest with her. Tell her the truth. Dont blame it on her just say the sexual chemistry doesnt match. She shouldnt take it as her fault and if she does then thats her problem not yours. As a girl myself id hate being lied to more then anything cause if i found out i was lied itd most definitely lead to me thinking it was actually me that was the issue and i never got the chance to try and fix it or atleast be told about it.",
            "I think before you do anything, you need to figure out what sexual chemistry means to you. I know it's hard to define, but look hard for answers and solutions. \n\nThe worst thing that can happen is that you leave someone you love for a problem you think may be fixed by another person - to only realize perhaps the problem wasn't what you believed it to be. \n\nI just want to throw this idea out there just on case you haven't considered it. \n\nTldr - define how you view sexual chemistry and make sure that's the problem and not a symptom of something else.",
            "\nBecause you don't tell her the real reason...you just say \"we're not a good match for each other\" or \"I need space\".  While not a perfect reason, they are reasonable reasons to end things with someone.",
            "Just tell her you two are not compatible. You can say \"we are not sexually compatible\" but maybe leave the 'sexually' word out if you don't want to hurt her ego too much. I've told guys we aren't sexually compatible and it did not end well. Ego was shattered. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaha you should have seen another post on here where a girl said her man broke up with her cause she was \"too good at sex.\" Ah man... if only she knew guys like you and many others are looking for that lol.",
            "I would say what you said here, she is beautiful and is more than likely a great person, but you have to consider yourself in the end too. It will hurt no matter what, but I think as long as you tell her there's nothing wrong with her, it will be better than just not explaining anything. I had a relationship that just didn't feel good, something was missing. I am a better person for letting it go. The person was wonderful, but I ran into the same situation. Do what you need to do.",
            "Honestly this if you want to give her a reason just say \"I dont feel like we are compatible long term\".  \n\n\nShort, sweet and to the point. It doesnt mention where the compatibility issues lie but if you say that sex issues come up often and she frequently feels rejected by you shes going to quickly understand what you mean if shes a smart woman.   \n\n\nSex incompatibility is a perfectly good reason for breaking off a relationship. Its MUCH better to do it now than married with a house kids and a white picket fence.",
            "I think you should stress how this is your issue. Don't blame her. Its you that doesn't want to have sex and you don't know why. Make sure she doesn't take this on and feel insecure, it is nothing to do with her. And your post sort of puts the blame on her, I don't think you mean to, but the way you word it does. Please explain that its your fault, you don't know why you feel this way, you don't know what's wrong etc. I think that might make her feel better. \n\nI understand not having a spark with someone, I've had that before, but I thought it was to do with me, like my standards were too high or something, even though, like you said, I'd had a spark with people I found less attractive physically. Chemistry is a funny thing. I spent 12 years thinking I just needed to try harder! So much wasted time. Good luck. xx",

            "I think you need to be honest without being too detailed or mean to her. Personally I\u2019d say something along the lines of:\n\n\u201cListen, there\u2019s a lot of things I\u2019m happy with in this relationship, but it\u2019s no secret that our sexual chemistry has been lacking since the beginning. It\u2019s nothing that you\u2019re doing personally, but I believe that sexual chemistry comes naturally and after two years, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s something we\u2019ll be able to fix. I want you to be happy and be with someone who you can have a great sex life with, and I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t think I can be that guy for you.\u201d\n\nI know that\u2019s really long, but you get the gist. I think it\u2019s really wrong to break up with her (after 2 years) without giving her some clue as to why. It\u2019s going to hurt either way but I\u2019d try to be honest without going into details (i.e. saying that she doesn\u2019t do something well enough, etc)\n\nSorry man, hope all goes well with you. I\u2019m sure this sucks for you too but like you said, you can\u2019t fake sexual chemistry.",
            "You can't spare her feelings. You can avoid being unnecessarily mean, but you cannot prevent her from having hurt feelings. It doesn't sound like she's unwilling to try things with you or be open or adventurous, so I fail to see what good would come of therapy specific to this. Ya'll just don't 'click' in that way, and that would absolutely be a deal breaker for me. I just wouldn't have waited two years to tell her that.",
            "I hope that'll help you but I had this problem with my ex as well. I thought that the chemistry would eventually appear someday but after my ex pointed out that he could see I had no real desire to have sex, I had to admit to myself that we needed to break up.\n\nThe thing is, I could see that my ex was blaming himself for that, asked me if he wasn't attractive enough or if there were things he could change. We already tried to improve things sexually but it was just the chemistry on my end really. So I knew that admitting to him that there's a lack of sexual chemistry would just kill him, while it wasn't even his fault. I decided to break up telling him that it just doesn't work out for me, that I see him more as a best friend than a partner, instead of pointing out the physical part. It's just the truth without giving away too many details. I think I wouldn't like hear myself that someone I've been dating for 2 years wasn't physically attracted to me enough, I'd rather have them just to stop to 'I don't see you that way but care very much about you'.\n\nEdit: forgot a few words to make sense...",
            "Shit man. If you\u2019ve tried and it doesn\u2019t work there\u2019s really no point staying together. Sex isn\u2019t everything but it\u2019s important and you\u2019re right, she does deserve someone that lusts for her. It helps the connection",
            "When you break up dont include that it's because you don't enjoy having sex with her, use a different truth for example you honestly don't see a future with her. Will it hurt? Hell yes. Will it shatter her self esteem? No?",
            "Don't tell her why. Just say you aren't happy. Ending relationships is like working in an at will state. You can be terminated without cause at any time.\n\nYou don't owe her a spreadsheet worth of reasons.",

            "I was in this exact situation with my last girlfriend and did not want to hurt her either. \n\nI lied and told her the break up was for other vague reasons which never gave her any closure. If I were you, I would be upfront and tell her the truth. \n\nRather she has one thing to process rather than thinking it\u2019s multiple things and not knowing.",
            "I once tried to make it work with a really smart, funny, successful girl who I simply wasn\u2019t physically attracted to. Once I realised the feelings of physical attraction weren\u2019t going to develop, I had to end things, but there was NO WAY I was gonna tell her the real reason. Made up some bullshit excuse and ended things, she was upset but probably not nearly as crushed as she would be had I told her she just really wasn\u2019t doing it for me in the looks department.",
            "Bro its rough, I feel like I blacked out and types all this lol, you are describing my exact situation. I (m27) love my girlfriend so much. She (f22) is smart, determined, ambitious, funny as hell, agrees with me on almost everything.... she is my absolute best friend. \n\nBut I dont and never have enjoyed sex with her. With previous girlfriends and flings I was insatiable, always wanting sex and ready and willing to try and do anything, whenever. With her, I would rather do anything but have sex.\n\nShe has noticed this, and has complained about it. She has a strong sexual appetite. I now live my life forcing myself to have sex almost every night, when 9 out of 10 times I have no desire to. I do this to spare her feelings because I love every other aspect of our relationship. It's a sacrifice I feel I can live with to have my best friend around.",
            "Honesty is the best policy. Sexual chemistry is really important and just because you don\u2019t feel as attracted to her (sexually) as you\u2019d like, that doesn\u2019t mean someone else won\u2019t in future. If she is secure enough, she will be able to understand that without it \u201cshredding\u201d her self-esteem.",
            "Sometimes we think it's about chemistry but I'd wager its comfort and familiarity mixed in with some interpersonal gripes you've probably supressed. Open honest communication is vital, more than chemistry.\n\nWhat's more concerning is that you haven't felt comfortable to openly share how you feel about specifics. Life is exceptionally messy and awkward at times, certainly in a relationship too. So you've got to learn how to speak about these sensitive themes with your partner. Why? Because even if you do part, it's certain that Something will eventually piss you off, trigger you, or make you uncomfortable in the next relationship. It's life.\n\nYou're not obliged to stay. And should always go with your gut. I think the bigger issue is not feeling comfortable enough to share your true feelings with your partner.",
            "As sad as it is, you do get to break up with anyone at any time and while it might be hard for your partner to get no specific reason you could simply say something like: \"I've been thinking about this for awhile and it wasn't an easy decision to make. I love you and I don't want to hurt you but I no longer want to be in this relationship.\" \n\nIf she does a whole lot of wait but why you can simply say that you don't think the two of you are compatible long term. If she asks for examples, say that you don't want to hurt her feelings and that your mind is made up\n\nThe only reason someone needs specifics on why you're breaking up is if there's a chance to work on the relationship. Otherwise, it's just painful and useless info. \n\nI know this is a difficult and sad thing to have to do, but the respectful thing is to do it. As you said, she deserves to be with someone who's over the moon about her, and you deserve to be with someone you're excited about, too. \n\nGood luck",
            "Before you decide anything else you should consider consulting with a sex therapist. You seem to find her beautiful and that she deserves someone who enjoys having sex with her, which makes me wonder if there\u2019s something emotional going on with you that is causing your lack of sexual chemistry with your partner. While it might end up being insurmountable, if you really love this woman than you owe it to both of you to consult a professional before you end things.",
            "If you do break up with her, don't tell her the sexual chemistry is bad. It will fuck with her head, there really isn't anyway around that. I would just tell her you don't feel the same way about her as you used to and you don't think you can continue a relationship where you don't see a future. That's it. It's not a lie, but it's also not a truth that will fuck with her head for years and make her second guess her sex drive, prowess, skills or feel self conscious even after she no longer cares about you. Take it from someone who was told this by a less-than-tactful ex",

            "You both deserve to be with people who love having sex with you. By hanging around hoping you'll somehow learn to have chemistry with her, you're just hurting both of you. \n\nDon't make the breakup about the sex. Just tell her that you care very deeply about her, and that you love her, but you know you're both just not meant to be.",
            "I honestly feel like I am in the same situation as your GF.  Me and my GF  have been together 2 years about and everything is fantastic besides the sexual chemistry.  I feel I am way more into her than she is into me and it feels devastating.  She denies it but she is the one who seems to prefer cuddling a lot of the time and I cant keep my hands off her.  Sometimes the sex is great and sometimes she has a hard time getting off which really hurts my self esteem because I try so hard to pleasure her to the best of my ability.  I want to make it work with her so bad but sometimes I feel she isn't sexually attracted to me as she was with her past partners.  Any advice on what I can do but be greatly appreciated - I think I need to be more sexually confident but it can be very difficult at times and I don't think it should be in a loving/committed relationship. \n\n  \nSorry you are going through this, I feel I can relate to your situation from the other side.",
            "I would just say the relationship isn't working for you and you're not ready to settle down. Yeah it's not the truth but in this case the truth serves no one. \n\nStop stringing her along if this is how you truly feel. If you claim you don't want to hurt her, you should have ended it ages ago. Stop being selfish and scared and let her move on.",
            "White lies, give a different reason.",
            "you begin as soon as you can, delaying only makes t worse. and begin knowing its not her, its you, all you. the blame is never the other persons fault. it belongs to us. no matter the reason. if she fucked around on you, its your job to forgive. if-you cant forgive, its your fault. if she continues to fuck around on you, its your fault for being with her after you forgive. you re not attracted to her, again thats on you. if-you think she taste bad,and is not clean you should tell her- nicely. if you don't again-your fault for not-saying anything are you getting the point? i made this pretty dark but-what it comes down too is-this : i adore you, i do. your a wonderful girl and someone is-going to be very lucky one day. but i am not the one. i cant give you what you deserve, i just don't feel it anymore. my emotions have changed and i see you as very sspecial but-something in-me has changed, in sorry.",
            "Do you know for sure that it's a matter of sexual chemistry and not a matter of your sex drive/libido?",
            "Well, here is my two cents because while I find some of this information helpful for you, I do feel like some of it is a bit off and some people may be slightly holding on to some resentment towards past exes. However, that is strictly my opinion just as is what I am about to say.... take with it what you will. I, myself, am a very sexual person! I enjoy experimenting, fulfilling the occasional fantasy and so on. I have been in your position and I have also been opposite of your position so I want to leave you with a couple of things to consider and think about...\n\n1. From your position, you said everything else is on point except sexually, then I\u2019m sure based on her future plannings she is going feeling the same (minus the sexual part) so if you are too vague in breaking it off if that\u2019s what you decide to do, she is going to feel as the whole relationship was possibly a lie. When there is no real or valid explanation given when you think things are good as to why someone you love and care deeply for and planning a future with has just dumped you, you feel deprived. Deprived of knowing what you did wrong or what you made you change your mind after all this time, which could lead her to possibly questioning EVERYTHING about herself. Was it this or was it that, or did I not do this enough or did I do that too much, ect. I\u2019m not saying you have to go into every little detail, just be tasteful about how you put it. That way in time she could grow to understand and know that she was still a wonderful girlfriend and that you two were just simply not compatible in that particular area. \n\n2. This one is fairly short and simple. Some people just are not compatible. Simple as that... My ex husband, who treated me almost like a queen (he did have his downfalls tho, but few) but the sex was less than desirable. He was handsome, fit, great body, but our ideas of sex were opposite ends of the spectrum. I tried early on to break him into things I like and how I like to be handled and treated  but he never could, and he was very quiet, I expressed them to him as well. And if you are thinking I sound greedy not taking his interests into concern, I did, his only two requests were he liked me wet coming out of shower or pool, ect.. (he thought it was sexy and turned him on) and he loved to give me oral all the time, which eventually became a turn off. I love giving oral and pleasing my partner but he was never that big into receiving and trust me when I say I have the kind of mouth that you don\u2019t forget,  and leaves you wanting more.  We stay married and I tried to get past it and eventually like you I came to not want sex anymore or at least with him. But he did, and it added so much strain, in the end we were just not compatible. There is such a thing. If you love her and everything else is a \ud83d\udcaf and it hurts you to think of leaving her or hurting not just for her but you too, and there is counseling then I say go that route, give a \ud83d\udcaf efforts and if it doesn\u2019t work out then you leave with no regrets.  My ex husband and I are with other people now and very happy. He has remarried and I\u2019m am with the love of my life! My main point here is some people are just not compatible. Best wishes, good luck.",
            "Wow I am in an incredibly similar situation, but I moved in with my girlfriend and I have about seven months left on my lease.  Almost a year ago we tried speaking openly about our sex life and what we could do to improve it, but over time things just kinda went back to what our natural chemistry seems to be. Now I\u2019m at the point where I\u2019ve dug myself into a hole hoping that things would improve.",
            "Girl here. Just be honest and say it isn't working out, and that you feel you want different things than her. You don't have to specify the sexual chemistry.",
            "You are wasting her time, just break it off fast",
            "It sounds like y\u2019all are basically just great friends, considering the sexual chemistry is not there. If you\u2019ve worked on it already and still feel the same way, I would  definitely have a conversation with her sooner than later. It sounds like you love her but maybe aren\u2019t *in* love with her, and that\u2019s definitely a necessary component of a long term relationship. Don\u2019t ignore your gut feeling regarding this relationship, that is my best advice. Good luck.",
            "Communication is key. Have a conversation with here where both of you describe your sexual needs, and evaluate from there.",
            "well. I just happened to login to reddit here, but I would suggest 2 things that will change it all.\n\nG, you really need to let her know what it is, without making the energy fucked. if you feel ready w no nerves itching, then its best to keep the energy stable and stay honest. if you do this right, she will literally understand and you shouldn't even picture her self esteem being destroyed, for the best results!",
            "A bad tasting vagina could be a symptom of bacteria overgrowth... look into it.",
            "Just tell her a very simple and short version of the truth.  Telling her you don't fancy her sexually will hurt but it will also make it easier to split.  Shed some tears and keep it moving man. Time will heal. There are billions of women. Move on. It's NBD.  Don't over think it.  Sex is important. It's not everything, but it's important. Good luck.",
            "Are you just not attracted to her?",
            "Just dont go into the detaild of why exactly you are breaking up with her. That will definitely destroy her.  Go along the lines that you no longer feel the spark you had from the begining and that it is best to part ways. Then go from there as soon as she respond.",
            "Trust your gut instinct, if you don'tlike her smell then your body are probably telling you that you two aren't compatible. The body is weird but your gut instict is often right",
            "Sexual incompatibility should be a deal breaker. She's at an age where she'll want to settle down and she does deserve someone who thinks she's the end all be all.",
            "I was you in this situation and it got to a point where I was repulsed by the other person and even though we had previously got along really well, my temper started to get shorter and shorter with them. I guess that came from a mixture of wanting to be intimate and not being able to and guilt for wanting to leave an otherwise fantastic relationship. The problem I had with him though was just general bo and mannerisms. \n\nWe split, had a few months of no contact and now we're really good friends.",
            "She'll get over it eventually. Rip the bandaid clean off and don't sugarcoat anything. Don't breakup with her with one of those excuses like \"It's not you, it's me\" or whatever else they use. Tell her your direct reason why so she doesn't have to sit and wonder about what went wrong. Not everyone is meant to be together. Sexual chemistry is an extremely important part of any relationship. Without proper sexual chemistry, a relationship will not be happy. \n\nYes, she will cry and probably hate you but guess what? You told the TRUTH and that's all that matters. In the end, she will thank you when she finds someone who does have good chemistry. You need to focus on yourself and what makes you happy. Good luck!",
            "You can't break up with someone without hurting their feelings.",
            "So this is a thing that happens. I'm not crazy.",
            "...you don\u2019t have to share that you\u2019re breaking up with her because you\u2019re lacking sexual chemistry like that. Just say you\u2019ve lost the spark and she deserves that.",
            "I think if u don't enjoy her taste and smell it is maybe bc you are not a good match genetically.  Your subconscious is trying to tell you something.   So you are really doing your future children a favor.   Maybe she has not had good chemistry with someone yet so she doesn't know the difference but you do.",
            "I would just tell her that you realized she is more like a good friend to you. You enjoy spending time with her but the romantic feeling just isn't there for you. I don't think you need to bring up sex specifically. You didn't say she's just so bad at sex that you don't want to have sex with her, it's that you just don't feel that way towards her. I certainly have no desire to have sex with my friends. She might be feeling something is off as well and just has been afraid to speak up. Best of luck to you.",
            "Just tell her you lost romantic attraction to her and view her as a friend so you don\u2019t think a relationship will work out.",
            "You are going to shred her self-esteem either way.",
            "Going through similar situation good luck",
            "Idk don't tell her why? \n\nJust say it's not working.",
            "You should date for love, not for sex. If you choose sex over love you know you are either a bad person or you have no right to be with her in the first place. Fooling yourself and worse, fooling her, into believing you are in it for love while in fact you are too narrow sighted to see the bigger picture isn't wise. It's a scummy thing to do.  \n\n\nSo, now your options to fix the problem and keeping her. But in any case you MUST tell her what is going on and what you are planning to do to improve the situation:\n\n1. You find yourself psychological help and see if you can improve as this is you causing the problem, not her.\n2. You suck it up, and find a good reason to stay with her so you won't hurt her.\n3. Get a sex specialist (no, not that one from the corner of the street, I mean a counselor that specializes in the sex and love topic) Visit together and help each other in improving things.\n4. Buy her some expensive flowers (red roses seem to be doing excellent with women), for the sensual part (yes that means teasing her instead of shoot and go), there should be enough great tips online that you could use or adapt to your specific ideas. It wil completely surprise her to start with, it may end up in very hot sex if you do it right and by doing it not too often you may end up bringing some sexual tension between the both of you that works for you both. Well worth to try out. Not going to hold your hand and tell you what to do, you need to learn in your own way to do this. Women go crazy for a man that puts in effort for them and goes to full lengths to completely swoop them off their feet.\n\nIf you refuse any of these steps, then you void the relationship by default. There is no reason to think you are in a healthy relationship if you refuse to work on it while she keeps trying. You will hurt her by giving her false hope if you don't do something to fix this situation you are in.",
            "I'm going to level with you. This sounds like the women you should have and hold forever. If it's just the sex and not the intimacy that's the issue, don't leave her, have a real conversation about sex with other people. Don't assume you are doing her favors by keeping your feelings from her. Be honest and truthful and what happens from that will be the best for both of you.",
            "Chemistry is about both parties. There\u2019s nothing wrong with her or you. This may break her heart but if you express it right her self-esteem should survive. \nEdit: I came back after reading through the comments of others and I think you can probably phrase it sensitively. Saying it\u2019s just not working out will leave her with too many questions but perhaps you can tell her that it feels like the two of you are more suited to friendship or that you feel too familiar to continue to be romantic.",
            "\nThe only way to make it \"easier\" is to make the problem known and try everything you can, as a couple, to fix it. If you cannot fix it, then hey, at least you tried. That's harder to do, but easier to accept.\n\nWhile it may be hurtful to tell her why you're breaking up, would it not be equally hurtful to not tell her?  If she knows the reason, no matter how crappy, she can at least conceptualize it and hopefully consider it in future relationships so she doesn't make the same mistake twice.\n\nBut if she has what is, in her mind, a perfect relationship, and then you just dump her with no reason, I can't see how that doesn't shatter her understanding of what makes relationships work. What I mean is, even if she finds the perfect man, how will she know that he's not going to dump her just as fast for no reason at all?\n\nHer self esteem is going to take a hit either way, imo. Might as well be honest about it.",
            "I get it. I\u2019ve also experienced once the attraction goes, the body chemistry literally changes and when I kissed my then bf, it was an unpleasant chemical/almost vinegar taste vs how awesome it was earlier in the relationship. This has happened with several bfs when the magic had gone, or if it was never there to begin with. When the attraction is there, everything tastes good...",
            "This has happened to me! i was the guy in a great relationship with a great girl that i just didn't have sexual chemistry with. Didn't in the beginning, didn't at the end. Thought it would change, but it just didn't. We still regularly had sex, but i would decline at times and she took that poorly. Looking back, i don't think it was something that she could have done. I broke up with her and went to great lengths to try and make it mutual. But it was so hard. She was super mature but took it hard. \n\nMy advice? Take a break. A clean break. But leave the door open as mature a way as you can. Dont send mixed signals, be clear, and err on the side of caution (cleaner is better). I say that because, I'd say about a year later, I dated a few other people, and I came to miss the non-sexual qualities about my ex. Idk if i would have eventually disliked the sexual part of our relationship again if we gave it another go, but i definitely felt like I was willing to put it aside after dating other people. I felt like it was a dissatisfaction born from who i was when i was dating her, that as time went on i changed, and my perspective of what I valued in a relationship changed over time in a way i didnt foresee.",
            "Don\u2019t break up with her. Talk to her. With open communication these things can absolutely be fixed and she would probably be happy you did talk to her as I\u2019m sure she\u2019s feeling the same things you are but doesn\u2019t know how to approach you about it. No need to throw something away that can be something great. Relationships are work and uncomfortable conversations need to be had to grow.",
            "Honestly see if she will go get checked for a possible yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis.  Sometimes vaginosis will be subtle and but still have a bad smell/taste and people don't get it checked.  I would try this before breaking up with her.",
            "It seems to me that you\u2019ve already made up your mind and mentally moved on from this relationship from the way that you describe it, as you are not questioning your decision or if it\u2019s worth salvaging. That\u2019s ok you shouldn\u2019t be with someone you don\u2019t want to be with, for both of your sakes.\n\nI think that everyone else\u2019s advice is the way to go - just explain to her that you\u2019re grateful for the time together but it\u2019s not working for you and you want to end the relationship. I have done this before without giving a specific reason/personal \u2018flaw\u2019 and it went fine, my ex was upset but he accepted it after I just repeated that I was sorry but couldn\u2019t go on.\n\nThe worst thing you can do is be with someone you know you don\u2019t want to be with, I\u2019m sure in the end she will see that too. She can survive without you.",
            "So here's my two cents from being the girl in a similar situation. My ex-fiance had a low sex drive and though we had a good enough sexual chemistry in the beginning, after a year or so I'd be begging for some kind of sexual intimacy.\n\nIf sex is already an issue even though the rest of the relationship is good, then she knows there's a problem. The question you need to ask yourself is if you are willing to try unconventional solutions (open relationship, swinging, sex therapy, etc). I would have done just about anything, including completely rehauling my diet just so my lady bits taste better to my partner.\n\nAll that being said, if you do decide to move on and pursue life apart, then definitely make a clean break. Don't stay friends. It is too painful. I'm 3 years out from that breakup and still not over it. \n\nGood luck.",

He called me just to chat this evening, and told me all about his trip but how excited he is to see me again. As we were talking, I realized I really like this guy and suddenly I felt this weight falling onto my shoulders. I had to tell him.\n\nSo I told him about 30 minutes ago over the phone. First he laughed, and thought I was joking about being pregnant. Once he realized I was serious, he got quiet, but kindly asked me to just run him through the logistics of what was going to happen and what it was going to do to me.\n\nHe was genuinely concerned for me and my wellbeing, and kept saying how thankful he was that I told him. He said he'd be there for me through the whole process, and that I don't need to worry about it changing anything between us. He was rather impressed by my matter-of-fact and practical approach to the matter- and that I had the appointment and funds covered without even talking to him.\n\nI honestly think this just showed me that he is a really good guy and wants what is best for me. He seemed to appreciate my maturity and mostly appreciated me telling him.\n\nThanks so much to everyone who encouraged me to do this. It was 100% the right decision, and I feel even more sure about a possible relationship/future together!\n\nEdit: Wow this blew up! Thank you SO much everyone for the thoughtful comments and advice.

Have things like soups, crackers, jello and other easy, gentle, foods on hand. If the clinic doesn't give you pain meds, make sure you also have a bottle of Tylenol or your favorite OTC pain reliever on hand, too.\n\nIf your FWB (easiest descriptive to use) wants to help and be supportive, gathering up those foods and pain meds might be an inexpensive and personal way for him to help.\n\nAlso, and I don't mean to scare you, but any medical procedure can go wrong.

You should defiantly ask for a small prescription of pain meds just in case and take the pain meds they offer at the procedure. It was a bit painful during. I cried a lot after and was really surprised how upset I was but hormones. Make sure you take at least three days off to get lots of sleep just in case. Also sometimes after its perfectly normal to have to massage your uterus if things are backing up.

Good luck with the procedure and i hope everything with this guy pans out well :3 he seems like a reasonably nice guy. ",
            "If your doing the pill abortion, get ready for the worst pain of your life. Like no joke, 9 hours of excruciating pain. Abortions are different for everyone, but I was on my hands and knees in the bathroom for hours. I suggest setting up a mini bed in your bathroom near the toilet incase you get exhausted of throwing up so you can take breaks. Instead of running back and fourth from your room and toilet. Don't even know you girl but you are way way way stronger than you think and ready to take this on. Good luck, oh and popsicles! Those were my friend during the time I couldn't keep solids down.",
            "It's heartwarming, it's good that he was caring in his response. With that said, if you did want to keep it secret there wouldn't really be anything wrong with it. Especially if you were a lot more distant with this FWB of yours.",
            "I'm glad it worked out great for you!",
            "Really great job with working through the this. My only advice would be to seriously consider inserting an IUD or some other form of LARC (long acting reversible contraception), so that the next time you get pregnant it is because you make a conscious choice to get pregnant.",
            "Aw, good for mike! It might be something one would think should be common kindness, but it's not common at all for someone to react to kindly to that situation",
            "He seems like a good dude :)",
            "This guy obviously really likes you. Almost no one who just feels casual about a girl would react this well.",
