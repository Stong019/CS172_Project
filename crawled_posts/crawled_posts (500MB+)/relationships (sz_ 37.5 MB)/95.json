She was taking care of me so sweetly, and when we were lying in bed together I felt so happy I just had to tell her. She said for her this is really serious thing and she needs some time, but wasn't weirded out or feeling pressured or anything, and instead was happy. I was perfectly fine with that and mentally accepted that 'OK, if things keep going well I can wait however many more weeks or months it takes her to feel comfortable saying it.' \n\n\nWe spent a romantic weekend mostly just cuddlin' and fuckin' and taking nice walks. Monday morning when she was getting on the bus to work and we were parting ways she said 'Goodbye, I love you' so matter of factly and out of nowhere my heart almost exploded. I was going around with the goofiest smile plastered across my face all day and wanted to sing and dance in the rain. Happiest I've ever been in my life. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: She loves me back and the whole world is roses and sunshine! :D Thanks for reassuring me it wasn't freakily-too-soon",

            "As someone who fell stupidly in love with her partner.. Two WEEKS into talking... Two years later? I still am stupidly in love with the same person.. And I literally LITERALLY told him. 'You're going to think im some crazy freaking lady... ' Because I felt that I wanted to say it, stopped myself from doing though, even though it wanted to come out. I thankfully escaped the dreaded blurting it out. BUT, He coaxed it out of me only to say the same thing right BACK. We honestly couldn't be happier :)! Congratulations! I'm happy for the both of you! Keep smiling and make sure you keep letting her know just how much she means to you!",

I'd always say, \"yeah we should totally date\" and smile at her.  And at the time I always wanted to say \"yeah, but really we should totally get married\".\n\nAnyways, months later I proposed which is when she told me every time she had said we should date, really she was saying we should get married in her head, but she didn't wanna freak me out.\n\n<3 good luck you two <3",

So I held out...for about two weeks, and then one night I just blurted out: \"you don't have to say it back, but I need to tell you that I love you\". He didn't say it back then, and I was okay with that. I never wanted to pressure him into saying something that he didn't really mean. A couple of months later he answered: \"I love you too\". :) And he's still my boyfriend almost two years later, so I can't have messed up too bad.",

I was deathly afraid of revealing my secret, though, in case she were scared off. I could barely contain it, and would look at her, and my lips would say that I like her very much, but my eyes said that I loved her, and she KNEW what my eyes were saying.\n\nEventually it just came out and wasn't even a huge deal after that, just a burden gone, a loose end tied up. One less thing to be uncertain about.\n\nI still love her :)",

I tried to assemble his dresser while drunk. He took a nap. I gave up and went to angry nap next to him (angry at dresser. Not him). When we woke up we were talking and saying how we \"really really really liked\" each other. And he just said it, that he loved me. I couldn't say it back right then. But the next day I did. :)",

He's so sweet and caring and just... wow! I never thought I'd love someone as much as I love him. I've never felt this way for a partner before and it's a bit overwhelming but it's An amazing experience all the same! He said it first and I was just shocked... he was scared I was going to reject him. I was like, \"No! You don't understand dude! I have such a strong and intense feeling for you and have for awhile and I didn't know that you felt the same. I love you too!\" \n\nJust go with your heart would be my best advice on this!",

She eventually started a verbal disagreement about how my husband could have done better than me etc. I tried to keep my cool and ignore her, but she eventually started screaming and my husband had to tell her to calm down and intervene.\n\n\nI ended up going to bed (their guest room) and my husband and her husband stayed downstairs watching TV while SIL did the dishes. I dozed off and was awoken a while later by someone touching my hair. I sleepily thought it was my husband and rolled around and saw SIL snipping my hair with scissors. I immediately pushed her away and she ran out of the room. I went downstairs and informed my husband and his brother and showed them the cut strand. They both said that SIL \"is immature and not let her get on your nerves\".\n\n\nI do not understand how they can be so passive and not think this is a big deal?!?!?! Am I overreacting? This is NOT normal behaviour for someone who is nearly 40 and I am so angry that she cut my hair while I was sleeping. I told my husband that I no longer want to visit her and he told me that I was acting like a drama queen and sinking to her level.

            "You SIL needs professional mental health help and your brother and husband are complete morons for enabling her behavior by telling you not to let her get on your nerves. Your husband is spineless and unsupportive and a total asshole for calling you the drama queen.",
            "What. The. Ever loving. Fuck?\n\n>Am I overreacting?\n\nNo. \n\n>I told my husband that I no longer want to visit her and he told me that I was acting like a drama queen and sinking to her level.\n\nHe's an idiot. What the hell kind of passive doormat lets a person get away with disrespecting their wife like that? I can't even imagine the shades of red I would see if my sister did that to my wife. All the rage. Forget the wife thing but just basic personhood. Whats next is she going to sneak ex-lax in you food and you just need to get over it? I'd be in a fucking hotel by now.",
            "Time to screencap all these comments, print them out, and shove them at him because he's so used to her demented behavior that he can no longer tell when she's being COMPLETELY INSANE.\n\nIf you do that, let me just take the time to say: Mr. \"Husband\", this is not normal. This is not healthy. This is not something people do. And if you can't see that, then your wife has EVERY reason to disengage herself from both your sister AND YOU. Because this is unhealthy and dangerous. And if you have, or want to have, children, what sort of message does this send that nearly **40 year old** Auntie is \"normal\" and \"reasonable\" for *going after another women with scissors while she slept*.",
            "Your husband is out of his fucking mind if he thinks you're the one being a drama queen. What she did is technically assault and battery. Does it rise to the level of a reportable offense? Probably not, but it's a pretty solid indicator that she's not afraid to physically escalate a dispute.    \n   \nEdit for the pedagogues.",
            "Your husband and her husband are certainly enabling her, if not completely ignoring a serious mental health issue. She has the power in those relationships. They won't confront her about her behavioral issues, they instead *tell the victim to not let it get on their nerves*. I know hair can be a materialistic thing, but I would just not feel that safe around this woman. What limits does her hysteria and lack of responsibility know? Cutting your hair, to me, is disconcerting. It is a personal attack - it is a form of violence, it's serious shit.\n\n* I no longer want to visit her and he told me that I was acting like a drama queen\n\nFucking, really? This might be a sign of just how much he does not want to confront the issue. Your concern *for your personal safety* is not being a fucking drama queen, it's being a mindful god damned adult about the situations you find yourself in. **You're being completely reasonable.** \n\nIf she's not going to do anything about her behavior; and the two men who have some of the most potential to get her attention about it are resigned to do nothing, then it makes sense to remove yourself from it all. They won't defend you, and your husband even invalidates you, you're the only person looking out for you and I wouldn't back down. I'd rather go through a divorce than be married to someone who's, well, committed to enabling this much deficient mental health and behavior.",
            "It's a big deal.\n\nI think it's more concerning that your husband thinks you're the one being a drama queen when his middle aged sister decided to take it out on your hair. Be firm, explain how it's not okay, and I'd highly suggest ignoring your SIL. It's apparent that she's not mature enough to handle any adult relationship.",
            "What if next time she takes the scissors to a different part of you? This is not the works of a stable person. I can see if she were a child. Not an adult. She needs help, and your husband needs to open his eyes and grow a pair, sorry to be blunt.",
            ">I told my husband that I no longer want to visit her and he told me that I was acting like a drama queen and sinking to her level.\n\nThis dismissive attitude is very likely an enormous contributor to this woman feeling like it's OK for her to do whatever the hell she wants. No one bats an eye at her atrocious behavior, she's getting away with no consequences. \n\nYou should refuse to be anywhere near her, as she might escalate the aggression and actually hurt you. No exceptions made, no christmas, no birthdays, nothing; if she is to be at a place, then you're not going. If she shows up, you leave. \n\nMake it clear to your husband that you've had enough. Show him this thread, there will be plenty of people outlining exactly how harmful it is for him to be so dismissive of her action and how he should have your back. Good luck.",
            "You married into a family of weirdos. Your husband does not stand up for you at all. At first he makes you go visit SIL, with a history of being rude and condescending to you, then when she says her brother could have done better to you, what a good husband should do is get up and leave with you, not just sweep it under the rug, and the cutting hair thing is one of the weirder psycho things I have read on here and doesn't need much commentary.\n\nIf this is the general attitude of your husband I suggest you reevaluate your marriage.\n\nThe only positive thing you might be able to draw out of this, if you are into sadistic glee is that SIL probably did this (along with undermining you) is because she wanted to make you uglier, which means she is jealous of you because her life sucks. ",
            "That might be considered assault and I'd call the cops. If your husband won't stand up for you, I'd tell him marriage counseling is required if he wants to continue to be married.\n\nAnd NEVER speak to SIL again. ",
            "That's assault and you should call the cops.  Your husband should be supporting you on this.  He should also have your back when she starts on how he could do better than you, what the hell is that?",
            "> Husband thinks I am being a drama queen.\n\nNope. Nope nope nope nope. If husband fails to understand how wildly inappropriate and in fact *criminal* SIL's behavior is, then he is either a complete moron or at the very least in need of a serious dose of reality checking. What SIL did qualifies as assault and you should make sure Husband is aware that you have the right, by law, to pursue charges against her.\n\nBeyond the law, though, your Husband needs to have your back in all things, especially when it comes to the behavior of his bratty sister (however old she is). You need to make it absolutely clear to him how disappointed you are in his inability to stand up for you. That is totally not acceptable.",
            "Your husband needs to stop enabling his sister and support you, his wife, the woman he chose to be his partner and his #1 priority.\n\nEven if you don't believe in the bible or any sort of religion, when I used to go to church there was a quote I learned that always stuck with me.  It says something like \"a man will leave his mother and father and become one with his wife, forsaking all others.\"  To me, that means that when a couple gets married, they become a team, and no family member should come between them.  A spouse should always support their significant other.\n\nI would sit down with him and make it clear that you feel completely disrespected and unsafe around his sister, and that he needs to decide whether he wants an adult relationship with you or whether he wants to remain a child with his family.  Coexisting is possible, but not when she has free reign to treat you however she likes and you are expected to be the \"bigger person\" and take it.  That's not fair.  He is taking the easy way out and ignoring the problem instead of backing up his wife.\n\nI would suggest counseling because an impartial outside party can clearly see that her behavior is wrong, and their advice will probably get through to your husband a lot easier than if you try to handle this yourselves.  It's not right, but since you have a history of bickering with his sister he may see your complaints as \"drama\" and \"over exaggerating\" until they are examined by someone else.\n\nFinally, I would also suggest you do your best not to get drawn into these sophomoric arguments with your SIL.  Try your best to politely defer her.",
            "I would be taking a serious look at the state of my marriage after this.",
            "You are completely in the right. Picking fights with you, and then attacking a part of you when you are asleep, unconscious, and completely vulnerable is not an acceptable form of behaviour for a 40 year old woman. A person who is supposed to be an **adult**.\n\nI don't believe that this situation has to end in divorce, but what I do believe is that you have to set some hard boundaries right now. Something like this:\n\"I may not be able to change your mind about what you're sister did to me was completely unacceptable, and so are you for defending such behaviour, but I will never be going to (SIL)'s house again. You can whine, make a big fuss, and be angry at me, but I will not go to a place that makes me upset, and where I feel unsafe. Also, if you ever trick me into going to a place where she is present, that will be the end of us. Pick me, or pick your sister, I'm not going anywhere near her ever again.\"\n\nIf you feel the need, I also feel that a restraining order would be in good taste.",
            "You....*YOU'RE* the drama queen?\n\nIf you reacted by screaming and leaving and slammed the door behind you while cussing up a storm you wouldn't be a drama queen as that would be completely justified. SIL is crazy and your husband is an unsupportive doormat.\n\n\nNope nope nope",
            "**This woman was doing something to you while you were sleeping WITH SCISSORS.**\n\n**Today it was just cutting a strand of hair. Tomorrow--if nothing is said or done about this--it might be your earlobe.**\n\nYour husband is immature if he doesn't understand how something like this could progress. \n\nA person cuts your hair while you are sleeping because they are too scared to do something more. So they cut your hair. If they suffer **no** consequences for **violating** you in this way, they might decide to **level up the violence**.\n\n",
            "I pride myself on my kung fu master patience. But if I woke to someone cutting off my hair, even I would forfeit personal responsibility for my reaction. It would be explosive to say the least.\n\nThat is an assault on your person that speaks to your SIL's capacity to harm you as a response to her feeling wronged or upset. And your husband is treating this as though you two were feuding 10-year-olds, certainly not that his wife was a victim of a physical attack by a 40 YEAR OLD WOMAN.\n\nIf he refuses to protect you from his family, then you have to protect yourself. You are not sinking to her level by refusing to ever be in the same room with her ever again. You are distancing yourself from a nasty, malicious woman who has demonstrated that she will gladly respond physically to any perceived slight.\n\nSo, no, you are hardly overreacting. Shame on your husband for not supporting you, for not being the partner he should. His behavior is as abysmal as his sister's. Prepare yourself against ever seeing maturity run in that family.\n\nLet your husband visit her alone. Maybe she'll give him a nice haircut he can show off around his workplace.",
            "They are being passive, because they perceive you as \"weaker\" and think they can push you into compliance easily whereas they can't with SIL.\n\nI would talk with the cops, like everyone suggested. I'd also tell your husband that if he can't take your side on this one, that you're leaving him for good. She's verbally abusive, which is bad enough, and now he thinks YOU are being dramatic for being disturbed that a grown ass woman cut your hair while you were asleep? The second she said he could've done better than you should've been when he got your things together and told her that she can no longer be a part of his life if she continues to choose to treat you like that.\n\nWhat is it going to take for him to realize the SIL is the problem? Will you need to get stabbed or seriously injured for him to see that?",
            "Not at all being a drama queen, I would be absolutely livid he said that. She's a fucking crazy bitch, DO NOT VISIT HER AGAIN. \n\n",
            "You're not overreacting. You should report her to the police. If she could do that to you, I'm concerned for your safety.",
            "OMG, my first instinct would have been to punch her in the face.\n\nWho the fuck acts like that? People who don't get called on their shit, that's who. \n\nYou are not a drama queen or sinking to her level by not wanting to associate with a toxic person. If your husband wants to see her, let him. However, I wouldn't spend another minute with someone without normal adult boundaries.\n\nI would also have a hard time being married to someone who didn't take this seriously. ",

You are in the right but if you appear like a whistle-blower, you will be seen as the cause of something trying to tear the family apart.

You are not sinking to her level by deciding to remove her from your life. Why would any rational person put themselves in a situation where they are unwanted and will be subjected to abuse? Tell your husband that his sister has destroyed any possibility of a relationship between you two and that you will have nothing to do with her until unless she changes her ways and makes a genuine effort to have a normal relationship.

This isn't something that a 40yo should be doing, that's 14 and under behavior (and that's being generous). \n\nAdults communicate their issues and through communication they are solved, not through such unhealthy measures as to go and cut someone's hair. Go in reasonably and say that you feel disrespected for his disregard of your well being and that you're not going to allow such misbehavior to be tolerated, tell him that it was a malicious act and that well-functioning adults do not interact in that manner. \n\nGoodluck, keep calm but be assertive and firm. Do not let him brush you off and tell him \"Don't brush this off, it's important\" if he attempts to and if he does you need to show him how important this is in whatever way is going to really open his eyes to this issue (i.e. Counseling session, or telling him that this is something that makes you consider separating that not only did he disregard your well-being but he blamed YOU as a victim.)",

Full stop.\n\nThis is not even just a question of comfort, or boundaries, or emotional violation.  This is a question of, yes, safety.  Questions about SIL's character (\"she didn't mean any harm\") are now totally irrelevant.  \n\nThe relevant facts are that she was using **scissors** on your **head** while you were **sleeping.**  That is all. This is just plainly, physically dangerous.  Questions about why she did it, or what she meant by it, quite simply do not matter now.\n\nIf your husband and his brother want to treat this as something un-serious, then they can do so without you.  The boundaries on what can and cannot happen to your body are **not** up for debate.  Again, I cannot possibly put this strongly enough.\n\n(God forbid that she try and pull this shit with someone who could be a survivor of physical abuse or of sexual assault.)\n\nIf they feel that SIL's behavior is \"immature,\" then you might point out that one way for her to mature is to learn that there are consequences to her actions--consequences like alienating a family member to the point where you are no longer comfortable staying with them.\n\nAnd \"immature\" or not, you might also remind them that, as a mature adult, you can decide not to put up with people who are being shitty--there's enough of them which can't be avoided, and nobody needs the optional ones.",

TLDR was: my sister flounces around in her panties and regularly tries to engage with my boyfriend sexually, whether I'm around or not. It's extremely disrespectful and annoying and I'm sick of it.  \n\nThank you to everyone who responded to my last post. Even though I was seriously pissed off (as I'm sure you could tell), I carefully read each comment and thought about it. Thank you all for your advice. \n\nOut of the three main options--talk to my parents, confront my sister, or have my boyfriend shut her down--I decided to take two. I contacted my parents first, which was very difficult for me, and told them about what had been going on and that I was going to kick my sister out. I said it in a \"no arguments\" way, just a statement of fact that her behavior was completely unacceptable and that I had given her many chances in talking to her about it. I said I was telling them first so my kicking her out wouldn't come out of the blue for them and they could help her find someplace else to live if they wanted to. I did not send the screenshots of her FB convo because 1) I never took the screenshots and 2) I didn't feel any need to prove anything to them, it really felt like my decision whether they believed me or not. \n\nTo my surprise, my parents actually believed my side of the story, though not for the reasons you would think. \n\n1) There had apparently been an \"incident\" at a recent family reunion that I didn't know about because I'd been unable to go. Our close cousin, Bea, who is one year older than me, brought her boyfriend to our annual family reunion to introduce him to everyone for the first time. Apparently Hannah shamelessly and openly flirted with Bea's BF in front of everybody--in front of Bea, in front of our parents, in front of Bea's parents, all of our aunts and uncles. I don't know *exactly* what Hannah did, but according to Bea (who I asked about it after) she was very obvious about it, trying to touch him a lot, sitting next to him whenever Bea got up to go somewhere else. Etc. It was just very obvious.\n\nEveryone witnessed it and it was the gossip of the family for that entire day. My aunt and uncle (Bea's parents) were disgusted with her behavior and judged my parents for allowing Hannah to behave that way. ALL OF A SUDDEN my parents cared about what she was doing, because now it was affecting their reputation with the family (the most important thing to them). So apparently they were pissed at her for what had happened and had taken her car away for a few months prior to her coming to live here.  \n\n2) My parents don't want anything to endanger my relationship with my boyfriend because they consider him to be a \"catch\" (white, handsome, going to law school) and want us to get married and have smart babies. :| So they don't want Hannah to ruin that.\n\nMy parents said they would talk to Hannah and beat it into her head that she could no longer act that way and that she was close to fucking up her living situation and our relationship. They begged me to give her a second chance and to give her time to change once they talked to her. I told them I'd think about it, but once we hung up I decided I didn't trust them to *actually* talk to her (call it 18 years of experience)... \n\nWell, whether they talked to her or didn't, the very next day Hannah posted something on her facebook to the tune of \"Sometimes you can't let other people get in the way of love! ;)\" So I sat her down and decided to have a talk with her myself. \n\nI told Hannah that if she didn't cut out her behavior immediately, I was going to kick her out. I told her that I knew about everything and that it sickened me that she would not only disrespect me by trying to seduce my boyfriend, but that she would freely backstab her own sister just to get with a guy. I told her that it made me feel disgusted knowing that she had a childish infatuation with my boyfriend, but that even if she did have feelings she couldn't help, she needed to learn how to control them like an adult and RESPECT ME, my relationship, and my home. \n\nHannah mouthed off and said that my boyfriend was going to leave me anyway because I didn't put enough effort in looking good for him (I don't wear makeup every day, only on special occasions or on dates when I want to look nice for him, and my clothes are pretty plain) and that there were dozens of women in this city that could catch his eye. Then she said that she didn't have to listen to me, fuck you, you're not that much older than me, you're not my mom. She said, word for word, **\"I'm not a kid anymore, I can do whatever the fuck I want.**\"\n\nSurprisingly I kept my cool and told her that was true, there were adult consequences to her actions, consequences which could range from getting kicked out and having to move back home to getting her ass beat. She was in the real world and couldn't get away with her shit anymore. \n\nShe said \"I couldn't kick her out because it was illegal\" and that she could do whatever she wanted, and doing whatever she wanted meant \"being herself\" around my boyfriend. So I told her that she had 30 days to evict the apartment. \n\nShe stormed off. I contacted the landlord and made sure that everything was square (she's not on the lease so they didn't give a shit) and told my parents that it was final, my sister had to be out of the apartment by the end of the month. They didn't say much and seemed stunned that she would \"suddenly\" act this way. They think the influence of the big city is causing her to act out... Whatever. \n\nI chose not to involve my boyfriend further because several people said that this was between us (me and Hannah), and they're right. I don't want him unnecessarily uncomfortable/forced to do something he doesn't want to do, though he has voluntarily offered to talk to Hannah and shut her down in the past. I personally don't think it would do much to stop her anyway, given her reaction to my little lecture. So I left him out of it. \n\nI am getting a small nannycam to monitor the apartment while I'm away however, to make sure 1) Hannah doesn't break anything and 2) to protect myself and my boyfriend in case she decides to make any false accusations against either one of us. At this point, I wouldn't put it past her. I seriously have to wonder if my sister is just a huge fucking bitch as a result to being hopelessly spoiled, or if there is something going on with her. I really don't know, but I'm fed up with her acting this way when *I* did her a favor in letting her live with me. \n\nSo, that's that. Hopefully I don't have to update again and she moves out peacefully... Thanks all for listening to me rant. \n\n**tl;dr: I called my parents, they believed me about Hannah due to some past behavior but begged me to give her another chance. I talked to her, she blatantly told me to fuck off. I'm not giving her a second chance. She has 30 days to move out and I'm getting a nannycam to protect myself, my belongings, and my boyfriend. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with her honestly.** \n\n**EDIT: So far I haven't heard from Hannah herself because I've been at my boyfriend's pad, but my parents tell me that she will be out of the apartment by the end of the week. Her facebook is a whiny crying shitstorm of \"LIFE IS NOT FAIR\" \"NO ONE UNDERSTANDS ME\" \"YOU CAN'T FUCKING TRUST ANYBODY, NOT EVEN FAMILY\" and \"MY LIFE IS RUINED\". I have hidden her from my feed and I am going to watch anime with my boyfriend. I have already served her formal eviction papers as of today; thank you all for your suggestions. \n\nAlso: some people seem very upset that I alluded to my parents thinking my boyfriend is a catch because he is white. To the point where I'm getting very redundant PMs about it. Let me be clear: I am not white, I am Asian. However, I do not hold my Asian parents' viewpoint. My boyfriend's race does not matter to me; I think he's a catch, not for those reasons, and I love him for who he is. My parents are old-school racist Asian people who objectify people (including their children) and reduce them to basic, simple attributes that are categorized into \"approved\" and \"disapproved\". A strong handsome white dude happens to fall into their category of \"yay.\" They also think I'll never do any better than him, so all in all it's a pretty fucked up way of thinking for both sides. You can see why I don't talk to them much. \n\nI never condoned this attitude and I'm fully aware of how racist it is, but there's nothing I can do about how they--and a large aspect of the culture they come from--view the world. I'm quite tired of people getting worked up about that one comment and thinking that *I* subscribe to that line of thinking. I do not. Thank you.**",

I am very glad she escalated to the point where you had to follow through, because it looked like you might wimp out and let her stay.  No, she goes.

First, thank you for all the kind words and great ideas. It really helped me get some perspective on the situation.\n\nFirst off, Sammy and I had a wonderful Thanksgiving. We spent  it out of town in a small skiing town. It was a great weekend and we spent a lot of time talking and discussing what to do about my family. Sammy was still pretty hurt over the matter but was adamant that I shouldn't cut all ties with my family.  I told her that all depended on my family.\n\nMy mom was in denial that I wouldn't be coming to Thanksgiving. After my last post, I let her know Sammy and I wouldn't be attending. She brushed it off until the day before Thanksgiving when she called to make sure I was bringing pie. I reminded her I wouldn't be at dinner and she broke down crying. She told me she was sorry for hurting Sammy and would like the chance to apologize. I let her know she'd have a chance after Thanksgiving. \n\nAfter we got back from our Thanksgiving trip, my parents came over for dinner. I had okay'd this with Sammy. She thought my parents deserved a chance to make this right and frankly, I think she really wanted to mend things with my family. Dinner was, awkward, to say the least. My dad started out by offering Sammy a genuine apology. He told her he was extremely embarrassed and genuinely wanted to make things up to her. They had a nice chat. The talk with my mom, well, that went okay. My mom cried through most of it and tried to reinforce that she was very sorry. I couldn't tell if she was sorry or just upset that I was taking Sammy's side. I don't think Sammy was convinced either.\n\nA few days after dinner, my mom called Sammy and asked her to lunch to talk by themselves. Several comments in my last post mentioned that my family probably felt Sammy was annoying simply because they felt intimidated  or projecting their own issues on her. I think that was spot on. Sammy went to lunch with my mom they had a very long, good talk about everything. She said my mom felt jealous that Sammy was so educated and had the chance to get an education. And Sammy admitted to being jealous that my mom has a big family. Sammy opened up to my mom about the situation with her own family and living on her own since she was a teenager. I think that hit my mom very hard because she's always been surrounded by a big, loving family. And, I think she was horrified by her own behavior towards Sammy, who wanted to be a part of the family. Overall, I think things are better between my parents and Sammy. \n\nMy younger sister reached out to Sammy after Thanksgiving. I don't think any of my siblings expected me to ditch family dinner and I heard they were pretty upset I went on vacation instead. My sister apologized over the phone. I don't know if it was enough, but it was a good step. Sammy says she's feeling pretty neutral about my youngest sister. She said she feels like my sister is more sorry she was caught, but Sammy appreciated the apology.\n\nMy brother had to endure a very uncomfortable few weeks at work, while Sammy was traveling. I think by Thanksgiving, he was confident that Sammy wasn't going to screw with his job. When Sammy got back to work after our vacation, he went to her office to apologize. Again, I think he apologized just to appease us. But, he did it in person and didn't try to cop out. Like my sister, Sammy feels neutral about him.\n\nMy other sister (my brother's twin) is the only hold out. She hasn't given Sammy an apology and seems pissed that she no longer has a built in free babysitter. She's doubled down and said she has nothing to apologize for and Sammy is the one causing troubles. This has caused a bit of a rift in my family. My parents would like Sammy and I to come to Christmas dinner, but I'm not interested in being around my sister right now and I'm not going to subject Sammy to that. My parents have even suggested that my sister should stay home to make us more comfortable in coming. While I appreciate the sentiment, I would feel guilty about my sister being alone on Christmas (her kids will be with their dad). Sammy and I have plenty of offers from friends, my sister would probably not be able to find a place to go on short notice. Sammy has told my parents she would rather not create a bigger rift and we'll come over at another time. Sammy told me, privately, that while she has forgiven my family, she's not all the comfortable hanging out with my family just yet. I'm perfectly okay with this, I feel like taking some time from my family will be a good thing. Sammy and I are still deciding where to go on Christmas, probably to my best friend's house.\n\nThe best part of the update: My best friend's wife went ring shopping with me. She let me go to all the chain stores and balked at the prices for the same ring in every store. She eventually took me to a local jeweler and we discussed a custom ring. The jeweler completely understood what I wanted and I decided she would be great at designing a ring. She's pretty backed up with orders, and said she'd be able to get to it in January. A few nights ago, she texted me a picture of a stone she had found, to see if it fit what I had in mind. Sammy saw the text and it led to an impromptu proposal. She said yes! So, now I have a fiance! We haven't really told anyone yet. I'll tell my family at some point. But for now, I'm enjoying sharing this time with her. \n\nSo, things are okay. Better than I hoped since my last post. I'm very sad about my sister because I miss her and her kids. And I miss my family. But, I feel good about my decisions. I feel like things will get better with my family, except my sister, in time. Sammy liked the idea of a destination wedding next summer, but we haven't even started any planning yet. Sammy told me after everything that's happened with my family, she feels confident that I have her back and that she finally has me as her true family.\n\nTL;DR Parents, brother and sister apologized and tried to make things right. Other sister is holding fast in her assholishness. Proposed and now I have a fiance. ",

Your post broke my heart so much, but how you reacted amazingly made it all better. I wish you guys the best.\n\n3. Your family can fuck off, MY GOD. I'm glad they are coming around, but MY GOD.

Hopefully you can arrange a visit with the rest of the family, without the sister. That way you can bond and start to rebuild those relationships, since Sammy really seemed to appreciate them before shit hit the fan.",
            "Thank you for happy-updating us; this is great news :)  I'm so glad your mother, particularly, warmed up to Sammy. Half-hearted apologies from the others at least tells you they know they were out of line.  Your other sister will either grow up and learn to apologise or be uncomfortable at every family gathering ever.  Her choice.",

Sounds like she could use some time to herself to think about things. \n\nThat said, your current plan sounds best. If your fiancee isn't up to spending time with your family again then there's no reason to force it. So enjoy your holiday. :)",
            "This may sound odd but I believe after a few years of marriage and maybe a child or two of your own the two of you will look back on these events and be grateful for the lessons learned from them. And I'm not talking about a \"silver lining on a cloud\" kind of thing. I think the entirety of this experience - especially the ugliest and most difficult parts - will end up being a real foundation for you both. I'm very happy and extremely optimistic for you both. ",

            "Merry Christmas to you and Sammy! I'm so happy to read your update. I've had similar things happen with the family of an ex boyfriend, except they said the things right to my face. And no one ever apologized. I still think about it sometimes because it really hurt. As someone who has been there, thanks for standing up for Sammy. It takes a lot of character to stand up to your family and I've met many adults who aren't capable of it. Your reaction shows a great strength of character and a great love for your SO. I think the future of your relationship looks very bright. Congratulations on your engagement!\n\nAs for your sister, pride can be a very destructive emotion and is likely what's keeping her from apologizing. I hope she can learn to put it behind her so she doesn't lose her family. Learning to apologize isn't easy for everyone but it's central to having healthy adult relationships. I'm sure it's really painful for you to see her act this way. Please give us another update and let us know if she eventually comes around. I think she will. ",
            "This is adorable and sweet all in one! :) It sucks about the bitchy sister but... Fuck it. She'll stew in her own bile until she gets burnt out.\n\nI'm glad you and Sammy are together now. I remember reading your first post and wanting an update so bad.... I'm glad it turned out to be alright, in the end! Hopefully the coming months go well, that 2016 is a good mistress to you and Sammy! :)\n\nAlways welcome to Reddit, my friend. Have a Merry Christmas! ",

            "Congratulations on your engagement and not letting your family get away with bullshit. You and Sammy sound awesome.\n\nArmchair psychology: it looks like your siblings are between relationships? Sounds like Sammy is \"annoying\" because she exists and you guys have a separate life from them.  ",

            "I had an ex who let his family bully me, it's definitely part of why I made him my ex. You handled this perfectly! You stood up for her and did not back down, this made me smile. You sound like you're a great couple, and congratulations to you both.",
            ">My dad started out by offering Sammy a genuine apology. He told her he was extremely embarrassed and genuinely wanted to make things up to her.\n\nProps to your dad. Apologies - genuine ones - tend to be uncomfortable, and since you know him better than we do, I assume you're a good judge of how he felt. It was probably hard for him to do what he did. It's a shame that the comments had to happen, but it's a good step toward making things right again.\n\nMoms are funny, and I think my mom would react like yours. She's probably deep down ashamed at taking part in the comments, but also wants to keep the family together, even if it means not confronting your sister. My mom does this with my brother all the time - he does something terrible, or says something out of line, and she requests we all tiptoe around him until things are right again. \n\nCongrats on the engagement. You sound like the two of you will be an awesome team!",
            "Glad everything has gotten better since the OP, but I'd like to focus on this jeweler texting pictures of diamonds to someone about to propose. Talk about danger zone.

He doesn't deserve a ribbon or anything, but he tried defending your girlfriend and gave the most sincere apology.  Don't forget to wish him a merry Christmas and let him know you love him. ",
            "So many times here people fail to realize that their partner should be the most significant and important person in their lives, or they pay it lip service but don't actually follow through when the chips are down. Reading what you wrote, I'm glad you and Sammy found each other. Have a great time at your friend's place.\n\nOn a side note, be aware that any apology coming from your sister at this point after the holidays may be because she misses the free babysitter. Even if she does pay lip service to the apology, I'd probably recommend putting a stop to the baby sitting service until Sammy actually feels comfortable hanging out around your sister again.",
            "This is wonderful! Both you and your fiancee are really fortunate to have found one another and be able to find a solution around a problem. Can't say the same about many other couples, including myself, basically my boyfriend walked out of a perfect relationship at the first sign of trouble. Yeah it's heartbreaking but it made me appreciate the relations and people who are willing to fight for the relationship. Because of this I do feel the need to remind or just point it out to people who have such wonderful partners how fortunate and blessed they are. I wish you two all the best man! And hopefully the last sister comes to her senses soon! :)\n",

My husband and I have been stabbed in the back my a few people in both of our families. It hurts like Hell, and is a huge slap in the face. We've since learned that we (along with a few close friends) are the only ones we can depend on, and that's ok with us. Our communication was pretty damn good to begin with, and now it's off the charts. We're more open and honest, and constantly making sure the other is at ease. We know how to take care of our shit, and I think it'll be easier in the long run. Yeah, it sucks, but what can you do?  \nCongratulations to you and Sammy both, and enjoy your Christmas with your friends! ",
            "Maybe you should go to Christmas wig your parents, but with the insistence that your sister cannot attend. She was rude and is ignoring the consequences, so the consequences should be made more severe so she can't ignore them. Your parents need to take your side on this.  ",
            "I just want to say, you are a freaking AMAZING partner! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you and Sammy. I so internet Love you guys right now...\n\nAs a gift, you should show Sammy this thread. It only shows what an amazing bf and partner and how lucky she is to have someone like you. Sammy Rocks, You Rock! Congratulations and Best of luck in the future!!!!! ",
            "You should have a conversation with your sister, or if you can't do it in person then do it in a letter or online messaging.\n\nRemind her of the things your fiance has done for her.  Find out why she is being stubborn about apologising.  Tell her you can totally understand it being difficult if she is just too embarrassed to do it but remind her that if it is that embarassing to her that it is worse for Sammy that she won't apologise.  In the conversation tell her, or remind her, that you've proposed (or intend to propose) to Sammy and that she WILL be part of the family and you'd really like the rift to be closed.   \n\nYou can think about asking her to apologize for your sake as asking this in this way has good and bad points with the bad being chances for an even less sincere apology.\n\nI'll say one thing that isn't any of my business, but I'll say it just because you mentioned it in your post.  I'm not crazy about destination weddings and don't think most people should do them.   I feel it puts a real hardship on friends and family who either don't have the funds for the travel or the ability to take enough time off of work for the travel or both.  Of course this depends a lot on the details of the destination, who you intend to invite and the financial position of those being invited.",
            "I wish your girlfriend was right here so I can tell her to just love you and the rest doesn't matter.

So, what I'm saying-it's nothing on her-it's THEIR problem.\n\nWhat is sad is what you said about her family and how she never really had one--it's not unusual to seek it out in other people but I hope that instead she digs in deep into her own heart for that love she never got..and you will help too.

Your instincts are spot on and you've already set exactly the right precedent. My aunts and mother have had a rocky start, but for what it's worth, everyone eventually worked things out and we now enjoy holidays together as a family. ",

Obviously I know he's not perfect and I'm keeping an eye on that side of things too, as it's easy to get swept away.\n\nHe's very attractive, well spoken, well-read, open about his interest but not over doing it. Fantastic kisser. We're in the same industry and have similar life plans. Lots in common as far as interests. Hell, even similar ugly-duckling stories. He's been super respectful anytime I mention a boundary of sorts. I have a few as my last long-term relationship was quite abusive. Luckily my ex has been out of my life for 2 years. FWIW - I haven't mentioned my ex yet, just vague things like \"oh do you mind not surprising me from behind? I'm a bit jumpy.\" This isn't my first time dating since my ex and I have plenty of  (positive!) dating experiences from before him too. I really shouldn't feel so... Almost starstruck.\n\n**I just feel like a teenager again. Half the time I don't know what to say I'm so flustered. How do I get my nervousness under control and just enjoy the moment?** If this doesn't work out I'll be fine - I'm not so worried about my heart so much as trying to act like myself and less struck on dates! \n\nTL;DR: Met an awesome guy. Obviously trying to keep my head, but how to I stop losing my thoughts and wit while we're talking?\n\nEdit: Wow I was not expecting so many responses! Thanks all - it's great hearing stories of folks in similar situations, as well as some tips and tricks I can use to stay appropriately excited. Really appreciate the kindness shown!\n\nEdit 2: I should have phrased it like I'm not used to being so attracted to someone. I'm quite confident in myself and his interest! But that doesn't help me when he does something very goofy and charming and I'm a bit lost in how attractive he is. The limerence is strong haha. All the same the answers have been super lovely and encouraging!",

            "Oh gosh this could literally be me talking about my new situation (dating a guy for 2 months, no commitment yet). I have also had a previous abusive SO, have had some positive dating experiences the last 2 years. Like you I\u2019m nervous a lot of the time/being a bit of a dork to say the least! I literally have only had bubbles of feeling less flustered through spending more quality time together. Example: spent a day walking and chatting in some beautiful scenery and felt actually relaxed all day. \n\nAnyway, as my mum would say, you can only keep being yourself! I hope things go well for you he sounds lovely",
            "I\u2019ve known a lot of women who have literally zero idea how attractive, fun, interesting, etc they are... I mean hell, I was one too as a teenager. \n\nOne of my best friends from high school is truly GORGEOUS though. Face, hair, skin, eyes, all of it, STUNNING. Legs for days, basically the classic model figure. Always had dudes interested in her, but grew up very sheltered so she was a bit stunted. Anyway. I always figured she knew how beautiful she was because like - how could she not? Then one day in our mid twenties, she mentions that she\u2019s been seeing this guy for a little bit, and she\u2019s nervous all the time and feeling insecure because he\u2019s smart, attractive, and he\u2019s a lawyer, and I quote \u201c...I\u2019m, just, uhh, me\u201d and then referred to herself as a bumpkin. I lost my shit. I was like WHAT did you say?! Smart, successful, attractive dude wants to date a beautiful, kind, funny, self sufficient and hardworking woman?? BIG SURPRISE, LADY. \n\nIt really shocked me though, because I think she knows she\u2019s generally pretty, but is very self critical and just also has some self worth issues. She\u2019s always dated men they weren\u2019t quite on her level in some way, and it made more sense to me why after this convo. Once she was finally dating someone that WAS on her level she didn\u2019t feel like she was enough. \n\nAll this to say: this guy probably thinks you\u2019re attractive if he\u2019s dating you, and it sounds like there is also a real connection beyond the attraction here. Don\u2019t try to find reasons why someone shouldn\u2019t like you! Recognize that you\u2019re a catch and enjoy being with someone who is ALSO a catch.",
            "Honestly, he might think this about YOU! Lots of girls don't realize that the guy thinks the girl is out of HIS league. Just try to be more confident, enjoy the relationship and try not to over analyze everything, especially in the beginning when both of you are reserving your true selves from each other.",
            "Just because you think you are less attractive, doesn't mean he does. Personally I've always preferred people who are uniquely beautiful, as in, they are not what is widely considered beautiful. For example Im not generally into women who are blond, have large breasts, wear impeccable make up at all times, etc (there's absolutely nothing wrong with anyone who is, just isn't my cup of tea. I'm much more into women who have that rock climbing body, like to get dirty and have fun outdoors, and go light/no make up most of the time). \n\nHe may also really like your personality. When you really like someones personality, it makes them seem much more physically attractive.\n\nI think you will feel less worried if you can stop thinking of yourself as \"less attractive\". You may not have classic good looks, but that doesn't mean you aren't beautiful.\n\nI'd like to add that I'm happy to hear that you are aware of, and looking out for warning signs and are reminding yourself to not get all swept up in the honeymoon phase.\n\n*Edit* a word",

And he is still SO attractive to me, like \"out of my league, how did I manage this\" attractive \ud83d\ude05 \n\nmy advice is to stay cool and do your best to not spend TOO much time together in the beginning. I'm really independent but I struggle with allowing space during the new relationship energy stage. The best thing I did was allow things to happen organically.",

She's smart, funny, kind and our values align.  It just works.  I had a work colleague meet us separately (my wife was consulting to my employer) and then saw us together a couple of times, and he made the comment that he couldn't figure out how we were a couple seeing us separately, but when he saw us together and how we interacted it suddenly all made sense.\n\nIt's held together for 24 years now and we're as strong as we've ever been.  I guess where I'm going with this is don't second guess his feelings.  Being attracted to someone comes in a lot more forms than just physical attraction.",

            "I\u2019ve actually found that the people that bring out these strong feelings aren\u2019t the right ones for us. if you feel like you\u2019re not good enough and you need to somehow measure up- then it\u2019s not a good sign. \n\nIn my experience it\u2019s the slow burn that\u2019s real. The person you feel calm and comfortable with that you look forward to seeing each time. \n\nIt\u2019s a more relaxed feeling than the heightened limerence that it seems like you\u2019re experiencing.",

Things might end up in one way or another, but at least twenty years from now you\u2019ll be happy that you were able to experience such a profound feeling and did all you could do savour it.

            ">how to I stop losing my thoughts and wit while we're talking?\n\nWhat kind of dates are you going on? Dinner dates? It sounds like he is very charismatic and you're probably not the first one to be starstruck by his manner... but after the first date you should be able to get over that, as you learn more about him as a person and as you see him under different lights. \n\nI'd suggest planning a date where you know you can shine, where you know you will be at your most charismatic and confident. Having an activity planned can help, especially if it's something you're good at (and new to him). You'll be focused more on the activity and on how good it makes you feel, instead of freaking out about how perfect he acts. You can also try for more casual settings - go for a walk, meet for early morning coffee, etc. That way you get to see what he's like on a day to day basis.\n\nI'd also recommend writing down your feelings in a diary or journal. Before and/or after each date, do a brain dump of your feelings. Writing before can help make you more confident and less anxious during the date. Writing after can help you reflect on the pros and cons of the relationship.",

He was also wildly talented on guitar, better off financially, had the best dog I ever met.\n\n6 years later here we are zoom calling our baby niece and nephews and wrapping presents for our 2 cats and 2 dogs.\n\nYou get over it after awhile. I still have giant self esteem issues but I never make that his issue, ever. And hey, I might not be his level hot, but I am a super awesome human who with kickass hobbies, who does interesting things and has informed opinions. So that goes a long way.",
            "The first person I seriously dated after my divorce, I was a MESS of nerves.  The day after the first time we slept together I almost had a panic attack.  I was in my mid-30's...\"too old\" to be freaking out like that!  I've been with him now for more than four years and we own a house together.   I still think he's hot AF and a great catch, but as we've gotten to know each other, he was vulnerable enough to let me see all of his flaws.  Even though he's objectively attractive, and funny, and smart, he has a lot of insecurities as well.  Looking back on our first couple of months,  knowing who he is, it's laughable to me that I got so flustered.  We're both awesome but not perfect.  \n\nSomething I had to keep telling myself during that time - if he gets turned off or chased away by me being me, he's not for me.  If he's for me, then he'll be wowed by my strengths and forgiving/amused by  my weaknesses.  The sooner I start being myself, the sooner we'll both figure out if he's for me or not.  Turns out this one was!",
            "Listen to the single smart female podcast! It\u2019s been helpful for me. She talks about hyperfocus with men (something I reeeaally struggle with when I decide I like someone). She talks about \u201cmantourage dating\u201d and how it\u2019s important not to settle too quickly with someone and to keep options open in the early phases. It\u2019s the first approach that has helped me reframe dating in a way that is helpful to me. I kind of wish there was a subreddit to discuss this approach with other women who are trying it.",

            "It's sad to hear this.....maybe know your worth. Confidence is KiNG and is the MOST attractive trait IMHO.

Since it doesn't sound like you're way richer than him, you're probably just wrong about him being way more attractive, he's probably around the same attractiveness level as you. You probably either have self esteem issues where you're seeing yourself as less attractive than you are, or you're seeing him as way more attractive than he is because you're crazy about him right now in the honeymoon phase.

            "In this day and age, unfortunately, it is typical for a high-value guy to date down in terms of looks, because the sexual marketplace is awful for 'nice' man. He had some bad rejections in the past, lost (or never gained, really) confidence, never had enough XP with women and is afraid to approach his league. Of course, a genuine interest from a person of an opposite sex blows his mind. Your caution is justified no matter what the other commenters are saying. This situation is definitely more complex than \"he's into you, forget your insecurities and enjoy it\". I'm not saying you should dump him, but watch out for his coming realization that he's valuable (and his value's gonna grow, and yours is already deteriorating). You should try to make him realize that being with you gets him more than being with a handful pretty young chicks... Good luck",

Is only important in the sense that he is communication what he things is important for you to hear, or in more manipulative persons, what he thinks will get him from you what he wants. But right now he is performing to you and dazzling you with his looks and history (he know that he got them and he is using them everyone does), enjoy it, but don't fall for it. He got lines, things he says, theories that he needs to tell you so you see him in his best light... Let him, but...\n\nThe most important thing to know how he is (and his relation to you) pay attention to **WHAT HE DOES,** \n\nIf he is on time, if he pays attention to you, if he is careful and caring with you, if he does what he says he'll do, how he treats the ones around you and others than you, staff in a local, his family, other friends, your family... Don't try to make it a story, do it like a log and try to analyse it in cold after... \n\n\nHe entered, opened the door, waited i was seated, asked me what i prefered, listened to me, didn't interrupted (Friendly Banter even), was cordial and loving but respected my boundaries, wasn't pushy, wasn't needy, was friendly and reasonable with the person serving us, keep attention on what i asked for, asked if i was ok, listened and acted on what i answered, asked about what i said in other conversations earlier, do i have to repeat myself with him? is he sorry if i repeat myself and he sees that he did knew something but wasn't paying attention?... \n\nA Man, if has the \"high ground\" (from looks, status, power or relationship dynamics) or has the \"gift of word\" will/can twist a women into believing anything in a relationship, but can't hide his actions.

Don't underestimate how powerfully attractive these intangibles can be. He likes you!

            "noble kava or maybe a weaker supplement of ashwaganda can act as a mild to moderate mood health aid. Noble kava is mostly internet-order but ashwaganda is at Walmart. It's similar to St. John's Wort but safer long-term and has other health benefits. It takes the excitability of anxiety and mutes them down into manageable chunks rather than overwhelming waves. Doesn't mute the good times, just the annoying flare ups of nagging negatives. Kava is more similar to St. John's Wort in short-term use but is much stronger.   \n\n\nBest of luck in your love life.",

            "Don\u2019t worry about being nervous all the time, it may actually be a good thing! My SO told me recently that he could tell I was nervous on our first few dates (I thought I had hid it well \ud83d\ude05) but it was actually attractive to him :) It made him realize that I was really interested in him, especially because he thought I wasn\u2019t at first.

            "My opinion is, allow yourself to enjoy that giddy happy energy! If you spend time together you'll gradually become more comfortable and less nervous. All relationships go through different phases, and in my experience giddy nervousness --> feeling completely at ease is a common progression. At this point it's quite possible he's feeling the same nervous energy you are - regardless of attractiveness (which is arbitrary anyway), he's clearly into you! Embrace the awkwardness!\n\nIn regard to attactiveness, if he saw it as a problem he wouldn't be pursuing the relationship. If it's not a problem for him, then try not to *make* it into a problem due to your own insecurity. He has the right to decide who to date, and he's chosen you - do both of you a favor and accept his decision. \n\nAlso, it seems to me like you're a bit overly defensive and afraid to let your guard down due to your last relationship. That's totally understandable! But try not to let the paranoia go so far that you can't enjoy this relationship. If red flags start coming up, don't ignore them of course! But if things are going smoothly then you can let loose and freely enjoy every happy moment.",

            "You've got a bunch of good answers already, but I will say I had almost the exact same situation as you (prior ex from abusive relationship, shared trauma, leftover ptsd) and met my current fiance, who at the time to me was \"far more attractive\". You kind of start out starstruck before you realize you actually are dating someone who is your equal for the first time and it feels right. I would not worry too much about it, I was kind of socially inept at first just because I couldn't take it (literally just like you) but then got over it as we got used to each other, it took a few months.",

Like setting small goals and writing down if it is achievable, timely, reasonable , what you have to do to complete it and dates. Stuff as simple as making the bed.  Also you could work on self-improvement. I suggest this because when you were describing his attractiveness everything you named were character traits. So maybe it\u2019s a clue for you to work on improving yourself so you shine and feel like you are more on his level and he won\u2019t feel out of your league.",

I was genuinely wondering why he was interested, especially as I was very unenthusiastic about our first date and turned up looking like absolute crap, only to find out he was wonderful and turn into a gibbering idiot. I even wondered whether he could be secretly gay and using me as a beard \ud83d\ude02 (he's from a country where homosexuality is illegal and punishable by death). I know now how stupid that sounds and I'm pretty sure my relationships before him knocked my confidence more than I realised at the time.\n\nAnyway, we're heading towards our third anniversary, living together, and I'm still deliriously happy. I've discovered that he's actually NOT perfect and sometimes gets right on my tits, but I prefer it this way - he's no longer on a pedestal and even after seeing his less enjoyable traits, I still adore him.\n\nEnjoy the giddiness. It's a lovely feeling and I still get it now."
