        "selftext": "So last night I had some people over to to celebrate moving into my new place. I had some family and friends, including my sister and my mother. \nWhen I was growing up with my sister, she would often steal from myself and other family members. Money from my mom's purse or dad's wallet. She'd sneak into my room and take things. Steal money from our grandparents, etc. We aren't very close because of this, and I always try to keep an eye on here when she's around. \nDespite this, I decided to invite my sister over because she doesn't live to far away, and I know my mom would have been upset if I didn't. I put all of my watches and valuables in my safe, but I left out the watch I had planned on wearing that night(but ended up not wearing it and leaving it on my dresser)   \n\nAt one point during the party my sister asked me where the bathroom was and I pointed down the hallway and told her the bathroom was on the left. A couple minutes later I went to go grab something from my room and saw her come out of my room as I was walking down the hall. She gave me this startled dear in the headlights look and said she was looking for the bathroom and walked away really quickly. I immediately got worried and went to do a quick look around my room. I immediately noticed the watch missing from on top of my dresser. This isn't some cheap $20 watch, I paid over 30k for it earlier this year. I left my room and went straight to my sister to confront her. I pulled her off to the side so it wouldn't cause a scene, and told her that I knew she took my watch and if she gave it back right then I wouldn't call the cops. She got extremely defensive and started yelling about how she didn't take shit from me, and how I'm an asshole etc. At this point, a lot of people were staring and listening us. She told me she was leaving and started heading toward the door. I knew if she left I might never see my watch again, so I grabbed her purse from her and dumped everything on the ground. Sure enough, there is my watch right there on the ground with the rest of the stuff from her purse. My sister screamed at me and called me a fucking asshole and scooped up most of her stuff and ran out of my place. My mom followed her out and ended up not returning to the party. \n\nSo after an awkward rest of the party, I got a call from my mom. She was mad at ME! I got some long lecture about how I \"didn't need to humiliate my sister in front of everyone at the party\", how she couldn't help herself, and that my sister is crying and upset now because of the \"scene I caused\" She also got mad at me for going through my sister's purse and told me that I should never look in a ladies purse and that it was a complete invasion of privacy.  First of all, I tried to pull my sister off to the side. She was the one who started yelling at me and causing a scene that made everyone look over at her. I also wouldn't have had to go through her purse if she didn't STEAL FROM ME and deny it and try to leave. I'm not just going to risk losing a 30k watch because I \"shouldn't look through a ladies purse\" So now my mom wants me to not only apologize to my sister, but to tell all the guests that were there that it was a big misunderstanding and my sister didn't take anything. \n\nI'm really not sure what I should do about my mom. There is no way I'm going to apologize to my sister. She should be the one apologizing to me. And I'm certainly not going to lie to my how guests to get my sister out of the awkward mess she created for herself. \n\nI also don't know what to do about my sister. At this point I'm pretty much just done with her. I think she should be the one apologizing, but I doubt she will ever do that. \nThanks in advance for any advice!\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: \nHad family and friends over for housewarming party.\nCaught my sister trying to steal a 30k watch from me.\nEveryone at the party saw me confront my sister and find the watch that she took in her purse. \nMom wants me to apologize to my sister for embarrassing her and wants me to lie and tell the party guests that it was a misunderstanding and that my sister didn't actually steal from me.",

            "\"Mom, [sister] was about to steal $30,000 from me. That is not some small thing. I would have sent her to jail for that because any sister that would so callously just steal from me is no sister of mine. By asking me to apologize to her, you are enabling her behavior and making it seem like she got a pass. You need to understand that I don't owe her anything; SHE is the one that needs to apologize. I love you, but I am not bending on this and I will end any future conversations about this by leaving or hanging up. [Sister] does not deserve sympathy for being embarrassed; she's lucky I'm not reporting this to the police.\"",
            "If you want to be snarky, you could point out it'd have been even more embarrassing for your sister to have been arrested.\n\nHonestly, I don't have good advice for handling your mom.\n\nAs far as your sister goes, it's time for the kid gloves to come off. If she steals from you again, treat her like the theif she is and call the cops.\n\nEdit: Don't bother lying to the guests. That'd be enabling.",
            "\"Okay, Mom. I'll apologize to her for embarrassing her when she tried to steal a $30,000 watch from me. But first I'm going to call the cops and report it. OR she can apologize to me and I won't call the police. Which would you prefer?\"",
            "She's a 26 year old woman and still has her mother fighting her battles. This is stuff teenagers do, if it was me I'd report it to the police still after the way they've treated you.\n\nYour sister needs to grow up and your mother shouldn't be treating her like a 10 year old.",
            "Sounds like both your mom and sister are banned from your house from now on. Your sister can steal your moms things all she want, she doesn't get to steal yours. If you have other valuables in the house, you should look around. Things like a checkbook can hide in a backpocket. ",
            "She would get an apology over my dead body.  Never, ever, ever!  It serves her right to be publicly humiliated.  I wouldn't let her back in my house again and I would tell my mom to piss up a rope if she is going to defend your sister, no wonder she constantly steals.  Your mom feeds into it being acceptable. ",
            "\"Sis, I'm sorry you are a criminal, a thief and a liar who has been enabled by our delusional and irresponsible mother for years but I'll be fucked if you're going to rob me of something I worked hard to pay for. I'm done with both of you. Count yourself lucky I'm not reporting this to the police. I will do if it ever happens again.\"",
            "Wait, why did your mom say your sister couldn't help it? What makes your mom think your sister can't help stealing?\n\nThere's obvious history here, that you even mentioned, of her stealing. Has your family just always swept it under the rug and enabled it?",
            "I know I'm missing the point of the story, but you're 24 and you can afford a 30k watch? Holy fucking shit.",
            "Explain to her the whole situation. She probably got sister's fucked up version of it. Tell her she came out of your room looking suspicious and uir watch was gone, you pulled her to the side as to not humiliate her, and when she tried to run away, you got your watch back. Also explain how rxpensive this watch is. No matter what you do, do not apologize to either of them. Don't do it",
            "Flat out tell her that your sister is no longer welcome in your life and if she chooses to defend her she won't be either. There is no other method of recourse with people like that. ",
            "You could..point out that she is enabling your sister with this BS? Your sister is a thief and a liar. Covering up her actions, making them consequence free, does not help her. \n\nI would say calmly explain to anyone who asks that your sister has a problem, explain what it is, and explain what treatment if any she is getting (not sure if she is just a shit or if she is a klepto, but even a shit needs therapy, not lies).",
            "I was in a similar situation to you a few years back.\n\nFirst, you are at the point in your life where you will have to deal with your mom as another adult sometimes, rather than as a parent/nurturer.  You are past the point where you can look at her as a moral authority figure in your life and you're going to have to be critical of her actions (inwardly, at least), not as an angry/rebellious teen but as an adult who may very well have better judgement than her.\n\nSecond, it isn't uncommon for mothers to take their daughter's side over their son's regardless of what is right or wrong or best for the family.  \n\nIt also isn't uncommon for people trying to hold their family to get angry at the that the person who was wronged and is complaining for not pretend like nothing happened rather than try to get the one damaging their family to stop.  Your mom might think leaning on you is the path of least resistance, especially if your sister is especially unstable or stubborn.  \n\nYour mother also might be taking you sister's side because she feels her reputation is at stake while you seem to be stable and established.  There is a small chance that, if she is old-fashioned enough, your mother might even be worried about this effecting your sister's chances of getting married.\n\nTry not to take it too personally that your mother is basically acting insane here.  Don't put up with it, but realize this kind of behavior isn't a reflection on you.\n\nUltimately, this is going to be a make-or-break situation for your relationship with your mother and sister.  Your sister is wrong for stealing from your and your mother is wrong for taking her side.  If you give in even a little bit, they will never stop walking over you and they will never treat you with respect.\n\nGive your mother a chance to apologize and don't argue with her about this.  Limit your contact with her until she comes around.  Deal with with her separately from your sister and don't let her be your sister's advocate.  Again, don't let her argue with you about this, you don't need to argue with her, and it will just be bad for the family and make it harder to resolve the problem.\n\nAs for your sister, I would cut contact for a bit.  Maybe communicate via email or phone if she wants to.  Something is wrong with her if she is doing this, and she is just going to be a destructive force in your life until she gets herself together.\n\nRecommend to your mother that, if she really cares about your sister, she must enforce some kind of consequences upon her actions.  Your sister could be in debt, using drugs, or lashing out for attention; she might need counseling.  It is your mother's job to to get her some help, not to cover up her mistakes or ask you to lie to your friends for her.",
            "Both your mom and sister are completely insane and you would be better off without any further contact with either of them. \n\nYour Mom's logic: deal with your sister's lying by lying to a bunch of your friends. Wow, amazing advice Mom!",
            "This is what you do: silence from your part. Not a word, not a reaction to a phone call or text. Silence. When they jack up their reaction to your silence, you say this,\" I'm still mulling over going to the police about this\". Then silence again. Cut the sister out of your life for good, and if your mother agrees to never talk about this again, maybe - *maybe* you'll let her (your mom) back into your life again. Anyone who enables a thief like this is being a rotten parent. ",
            "Checking in from /r/watches . What kind of watch? Patek? ",
            "Don't lie to the guests. That might ruin your family's reputation and lose their trust. Just tell them what happened as is. ",
            "Damn dude what do you do at age 24 to be able to afford a 30k watch? \nWhy has your sister always been stealing? Is it some mental disorder or does she just not make enough money or something?",
            "Your mother is in denial, I'm sure. You're an adult now. Just simply be honest and straight to her about the situation. Tell her your your sister is no longer welcome in your home.\n\nDon't apologise to your sister. Don't welcome your sister back into your home until she gets some therapy (or maybe never, it's up to you).",
            "Does your mom expect you to say \"Sorry for catching you stealing my 30,000 dollar watch.\" Haha",
            "As you have plenty of witnesses try the following:\n\nMom my sister attempted to steal a $30,000 watch from my home. I have witnesses that it was in her bag when she attempted to leave my apartment. Unless I receive a written apology from her and you in the next 48 hours I am taking the matter to the police.",
            "The value of the watch is inconsequential. She stole from you. She is a thief. End of story. Don't mention the value of the watch because that just raises the lower bounds of \"acceptable transgressions\" in your sister's behaviour. Any kind of theft is completely unacceptable. ",
            "tell your mother to go to hell. she's a fucking idiot, I can see where your sister got it from",
            "Everyone seems to have covered how absurd it is that your mother is demanding you apologise for embarrassing her. Something that I haven't seen mentioned though is the privacy issue. She thinks that you \"shouldn't look through a lady's purse\" what about going through someone's closed room when you are a guest and stealing personal items worth 30k+?\n\nI think going through a purse is equivalent to going through a room probably less of an invasion of privacy than that. When you have probable cause and precedent for her stealing a watch of immense value I think you are well within your rights to search her purse in your own house.\n\nIf she wants her privacy respected she should have respected yours.\n\nAs far as causing a scene, she clearly escalated the situation and if she didn't want to be embarrassed in front of everybody she shouldn't have stolen the watch. Actions have consequences, being embarrassed was the best possible outcome for her. She should really have it iterated that what she committed could be classed as grand theft which could carry prison time. You were being lenient in trading prison time for embarrassment. If she can't comprehend her mistakes beyond that I think she is beyond your help. If she doesn't change she will end up in prison eventually when she robs someone who isn't family.",
            "Lol-your mom is cray cray.\n\n\"No mom, I'm not going to apologize to my sister for catching her in the act of stealing my watch, a class (whatever it is in your state) felony.  She is lucky I didn't call the police.  if you continue to try to force me to do this our conversation is over.\"\n\n\"but\u2026\"\n\n\"good bye mom\"\n\nDon't ever invite your sister to your property again.  never.",

            "The bigger question is why OP's sister hasn't gone to therapy for her kleptomania. Or is she stealing for money, which wouldn't make sense because it seems like OP's family is rich if he's able to afford leaving around a 30k watch. \n",
            "Tell your mom she should be glad you haven't reported it to the cops, and that if she wants to keep your sister out of jail, she might want to teach the sister not to steal, because even if you don't, the next time your sister tries to commit grand larceny, someone else will.",
            "You seem to care deeply about your family. If you're willing to reconsider financing family therapy this may be a really good way to go: \n\n\"Mom, I'm on your side here. Sister embarrassed you, me, and herself. She owes both of us an apology. \n\nI understand that it is difficult to have other people see that a member of our family is able and willing to steal from her own flesh and blood, but ultimately neither of us is responsible for her behavior, as long as we don't continue to enable her. She is lucky she chose to steal from someone willing to only embarrass her a little, but as a 26 year old, this kind of behavior will eventually land her in prison. Neither of us want that, and in spite of the things she has put us thought, I do want to help her. \n\nThat help will not come in the form of an apology and an attempt at sweeping her behavior under the table because that will do no real good. It is time to try and fix this for good. I am willing to finance group therapy for the three of us (or if you're willing to reconsider your choice not to fund solo therapy, offer that up instead) so that hopefully she can work out these issues before they do real harm to her, and before they do irreparable damage to our family.\" \n\nThis way you show that you care, you empathize with your mother, and you look like the good guy by offering help (whether she accepts or not). You'd be giving her a chance to take responsibility for her actions. \n\n\n",

Because I kind of get it, she's trying to keep the family together, she's trying to keep her daughter's reputation, etc. If I had to guess, I'd guess your mom isn't stupid. She can't control the daughter and she's doing the best she can. Obviously we know she's just enabling your sister's behavior. \n\n\nI don't have a whole lot of advice on mom I guess. I definitely would not apologize to sister though. No way. ",
            "You just have to stand your ground.  Explain what happened and leave it at that.  The mother may be upset but it has to happen.\n\nAs for the guests, I would just say it's a personal matter than you don't want to discuss.  They'll forget about it after a while.  ",
            "Cut your sister out of your life.  If your mom give you shit about it, tell her that she shouldn't have raised a thief.  Your mom will probably get even madder, but you definitely don't owe your sister an apology and your mom is out of line.",

Let her know until Sister has gone to therapy for kleptomania and has shown herself to be \"recovered\" and apologized for everything, you will not be spending time with her. \n\nAs for how you go forward? Tell your mother you no longer trust Sister at your place and she is not invited to any events you host. If you mother makes a big deal about it? So what. Better than the drama of having your guests watch you dump your crying sister's purse open for a watch.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it cost $2 or $30K, it is embarrassing to have to do that to another adult and makes people uncomfortable.

I'm **not** apologizing for her criminal behavior. Frankly, I'm not even sure if I want her in my life any more. She embarrassed me in front of my guests, family, and friends, and is not invited to further events at my house. If she tries to steal something from me again, I'm calling the police. I'm done dealing with her criminal behavior.\"\n\nYour mom will probably get upset at that; hold your ground. Your sister has betrayed any trust you might have once had in her, you have no need to take her back into your life.\n\nAnd don't say shit to the guests.

This isn't particularly mature behaviour, and between that and your sister's thieving habit I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't want either of them in your life.\n\nHowever, if you do want to keep the peace with your mum, don't bother arguing about how unreasonable she's being - she'll only entrench herself in her position. Perhaps just don't talk to either of them for a while so they can calm down, then reach out to your mother again, invite her for dinner or some such - she may well have realised her mistake by then, maybe even want to brush the whole thing under the rug. Which is sometimes the only way to deal with this sort of pride-based falling-out. But if you want to bring it up with her at that point, maybe phrase it in terms of what's wrong with your sister and how to help her - after all, it sounds like she REALLY needs to get some.",

        "selftext": "Hi!\n\nMy daughter \"Lily\" is a wonderful, kind and accomplished HS student who came to me with a request back in September when the school year started.  Her friend \"Rose\" is from a very very religious, almost cultish family similar to the Duggars. Women are required to dress very modestly, stay home, have a bunch of kids, defer to their men etc. Sports, music, dance, books and pants are forbidden for girls.  Rose has 6 younger siblings that she cares for and does a large chunk of household work.  Rose's father is even employed by said church.\n\nRose just found out over the summer that her parents had decided not to let her go to college - by that they meant that they would not provide a single penny of financial support, not allow her to live at home if she chose to go to college (aka disown her) and most importantly, they would never give their information for FAFSA, so Rose can get grants and loans.  Of course, she would be banned from the family forever if she chose to attend college\n\nAs many of those reading this are aware, it's damn near impossible to get financial aid without FAFSA.  I work in the admissions department of the largest and highest ranked state university in my state, and Lily wanted to know if I could help Rose navigate this issue and come up with other options for her to go to college. Rose, very bravely, had decided to defy her parents and risk being disowned in order to get an education.  I agreed to help her and we have been meeting up twice a week (Rose made up a fake bible study group to stay back after hours, her mom just had a baby is quite distracted to even care) since then at my house.\n\nI have grown quite fond of Rose- she is incredibly hard working and courageous with zero support from anyone.  I enjoy our twice weekly meetings, when I usually make dinner for the girls as well.  Rose recently confided in me that she wants to try \"sinful\" things because well, she is a teenage girl I guess. Here are the list of things she wants to try and how I feel about them.\n\n1.  Make up - Rose wants to wear make up ( a strict no-no), especially bright lipstick.  I am ok with this because most teen girls like to experiment with make up and I don't think red lipstick will make her a whore.\n\n2.  Tampons - Rose is forced to use thick, bulky maxi pads by her mother because Tampons will take her virginity.  Again, I am fine with this because I don't think your choice of feminine hygiene products reflect your character.\n\n3.  A 2 piece bathing suit/bikini - This is a big one! We have a pool at home (too cold now) and she has seen Lily wearing and walking around in one when it was warmer.  Rose wants to know how it feels to wear one (she can't swim btw - her dickwad parents don't allow ANY sports).\n\n4.  Ethnic food - Our family loves Thai, Indian, Mexican and other \"ethnic\" meals.  I used to occasionally order in when Rose was over, but she always turned down the food because she was told that these countries/cultures were \"satanic\" and their food would turn you evil or gay or whatever.  She now wants to try and explore other food.\n\n5.   Wine - This is tricky.  Because I work in a college, I see first hand how kids from overly sheltered families go crazy with alcohol when they get to college.  My husband and I want to avoid this with Lily, so we let her have a small amount of wine with dinner 1-2 times a month. Well, Rose wants to try alcohol (also a huge no-no) with Lily.  Unfortunately, I don't want to risk giving alcohol to a minor and I plan on declining this request.\n\nHowever, my husband is wary of allowing Rose these experiences in our home.  He thinks that we are explicitly undermining Rose's parents and no matter how crazy they are, it's still their right to raise Rose how they see fit until she turns 18.\n\nI disagree with him mainly because I am already helping her defy her parents's decisions re: college (he is ok with because she will be over 18 when she moves out.  Plus, I can sense that she is depressed about not being like the other kids and it's definitely affecting her self esteem and general happiness. \n   \n**tl;dr**: I want to help daughter's friend experience normal teenage life, husband is not too keen on it.",

            "As someone who grew up in a crazy, cultish church, let me just say how wonderful it is that you are willing to help this girl. \n\nThat said...tread lightly. Be extremely careful how you help. If her family gets wind of your \"interference\", it is likely that they will send her off somewhere else to live with friends or family. The more of these forbidden things you help her with, the more likely you are to be caught. \n\nEven if she washes her face clean, there's likely to be a trace of mascara. Even if she is very careful, she's more likely to slip and mention how she loves Thai curry. Or say something about how easy it is to run in pants. Or hum a bar of Taylor Swift's latest song. \n\nLastly, if you do choose to help her, do not under any circumstances break the law to help her. ie the alcohol. Crazy religious nuts often understand the law better than you think, and if they believe you to be \" leading their daughter a stray \", they may have resources to come at you. Your husband works for a university.  He does not want a contributing to delinquency charge against him. \n\nRemember, these people think that they are right and that you are influences of evil. They will do what they have to do to keep their daughter \" safe\" and \"righteous\". They will also question your motives for help.  Why would you bother? Is it sexual? (Not saying it is...just saying what may be brought up.)\n\nIf you are caught,you will be less likely to help her live a normal life as an adult. ",
            "Ugh, this brought so much back for me. I had that childhood but even just 7 years later the memories seem far away, like they belong to someone else. Bless your heart for giving a fuck about this girl. To this day, I remember that most people knew just enough about us to just think we were an incredibly well-behaved, if odd, family. But I do remember once a woman and her husband who lived in our neighborhood that we really liked, offering (in a really cryptic way) that if I (and my other sisters of similar teenage age) ever needed it we had a place to stay, we had one with them.\n\nAt the time, I was so damn brainwashed I was puzzled as to why she offered. I didn't rebel against the lifestyle of my parents until I was 18 and it was as if the scales suddenly fell off my eyes. I moved to a large city and lived among normal people, who my family had convinced me were all lesser, and amoral, and discovered the pack of lies and brainwashing I'd been fed. That said, I had been deeply depressed and suicidal since the age of 13. When I realized later in life that even just one person recognized the hell of a life we lived, that someone cared - well, it made a difference in my mind. That was one bright spot in a time in my life where there weren't many.\n\nI struggled with the FAFSA issue as well. First two years after I was cut off from my parents, nobody would provide me parental info. I hate the way that system is set up, it's garbage. Half of the people I know their parents didn't even contribute to their education. The ones who were in my position even were told there was no recourse. It was infuriating and upsetting at a time when I was dealing with a lot.\n\nEither way, thank you for your compassion for this girl. She will never forget it. Morally or on principle there is nothing wrong with what you're looking to do. I think your husband is wrong about \"undermining\" her parents. But practically speaking, if her parents find out and make her life hell or kick her out, are you going to offer her a place to stay? I will say that at least right now she's allowed to see and spend time with a normal kid like your daughter. We were never allowed to have friends because they might \"corrupt\" us. If Rose's family decides after all this that she can't hang out with your family or any normal people anymore, that would be horrible for her at that age where she's yearning for freedom. Just things to think about.\n\n",
            "First off, you and your family sound great, helping Rose in these regards is a wonderful and important thing to be doing. I'd agree with you that you should encourage and allow what you've posted about here. It sounds like Rose is in an incredibly stressful and quite toxic environment at home, and anything that you can do to help her out, let her experience what she should be able to, etc... is a great thing. ",
            "I think it's a good thing you want to help her. \n\nI suppose in doing these things you are undermining Rose's parents, as your husband said, but thats not always a bad thing. For example, if Rose's parents physically beat her and you allowed her to hide in your house til they calmed down it would still be undermining them, but that doesn't mean its a bad thing. I'm sure your husband would agree with that. Rose's case in reality may not be so extreme (at least physically) but I think her case justifies it.\n\nSome may say she should just wait a couple years to do these herself, but to a depressed teenager that would feel soooo far away. I really feel for this poor girl.\n\nThe most concerning issue I srr with this is that if Rose's family found out she did any of this stuff she would likely be thrown out and disowned. That's serious shit. If you're careful it'd probably be avoided but that's still a big risk.\n\nIf you go through with this I really think you should get your daughter to teach Rose how to swim when the weathers good enough. Thats dangerous as hell that she doesn't know how. Not knowing how to swim could actually kill her one day.\n\nAlso, if you go through with this just be sure you never ever give her alcohol while she's underage. If her parents found out they'd go to the police.",

            "You might want to xpost to /r/legaladvice also. They might know if she can seek emancipation from her parents which would also help with college. And if the parents find out what is going on and decide to try to take action against you. ",
            "Dude, I was this girl. I am forever grateful to my friends mom who would let me do things with her daughter and cover for me. She saved my life in more ways than one. And when I was disowned, she let me stay for a week while I got things figured out. Then later she helped me move into college.\n\n\nRose can do anything you listed in your home and you can claim ignorance. Maybe don't give her wine as that is against the law. In some states parents are allowed to give their own children alcohol at any age, but not to other people's children. \n\nBut seriously, she's 16. If she chooses tampons at your house there's nothing you can do. And who in their right mind considers Chinese food satanic? Nobody. You wouldn't have known.\n\nAlways be able to claim ignorance of parental rules.\n\nYou're not undermining her parents. You're being a gentle place for her to grow. Because she will be leaving that family - she can grow with you or end up alone and in a bad crowd.\n\nPlease, don't just talk about her weirdness and her families ABUSIVE behavior and refuse to assist her.\n\n\n",
            "This is tough but I think her family is pretty neglectful. Not to where it'd be criminal - but obviously it's having a bad impact on her.\n\nI would say if you trust Rose will not tell her parents and can keep stuff secret, then yes let her do those things. Except the wine. You don't want to get into legal trouble. Let her try make up, just have her remove it before she goes home. Give the poor girl some tampons, but keep in mind her parents could see them in the trash - might want to discuss that with her. Teach her how to swim - she could drown one day without that knowledge. And yeah, let her eat your dinners. Just no wine.",
            "It sounds like you have a new daughter, if you want her.",
            "I'd say don't facilitate it but don't police it. So if Lily lets Rose try out her makeup or try on her bathing costume...you don't know about it, right? No harm, no foul. And if a few tampons go AWOL from your supplies, golly gosh, you just never noticed.\n\nHowever, I agree that you definitely shouldn't give her wine, and honestly I wouldn't buy her \"forbidden\" foods, either.\n\nYou're already sticking your neck out very significantly by helping her with college applications, and I think it's a wonderful thing you're doing. But what you need is a) the justification that you're doing something for her objective wellbeing, as with college or b) plausible deniability. Otherwise you're just outright defying her family's parenting choices, and they could come down on you like a ton of bricks with some degree of justification.",
            "One thing I would point out is that you've taken on a great responsibility here, in that if her parents disowned her, you would be responsible and should, ethically speaking, take her into your home and allow her to continue with the life you have given her. \n\nGiving her opportunities that lead to her being kicked out of home and then not taking responsibility for the repercussions would probably destroy her completely.\n\nI should also mention that I agree entirely with your decision here, you're doing an amazing thing for her. I don't agree with your husband. It sounds like you have a great balance in letting her try new things out without letting her run wild.",
            "Hi!\n\n My mom is in a cult and therefore I have to file my FAFSA without any parental info. My dad is dead so that's a dead end (no pun intended). So. Here's the thing. \n\nShe can file as an independent through the school, which will give her more access to loans, scholarships and grants - she just has to refuse to put the parental info on the FAFSA. All info, even their social security numbers. \n\nOnce she's done that, she can file a dependency override where she'll have to submit a letter describing her situaton, third party letters, and anything else that can help to prove her situation. In my case, I had to get police records, death records, attend counseling to get a letter from a psych saying I was working to distance myself from the situation, and more.\n\nSome universities will go so far as to provide housing and waive tuition for students stuck in situations like these, so it's worth it to bring up. \n\nIf she has a specific school in mind, she can call and ask about this process and I'm sure they would help her work through it. Many universities also have legal teams that do free legal work for students or can at least point you in the direction of someone who can. \n\nThe important thing to note is that if she's under 18, now is the time to file for legal independence, aka get emancipated. If she waits until she's 18 or older, though she's legally an adult, she won't be considered an adult by schools until she's 24, married, or has children - unless she goes through the rigorous and time consuming process of filing for a dependency override that I described earlier. \n\nThe one issue with waiting and filing for dependency override instead of getting emancipated is that in the process has to be done every year with updated info and letters and everything.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding that, feel free to ask! \n\nBest of luck! ",
            "I think that you may want to hold off on the alcohol until she is 18, or outside of her parents' house. \n\n\nThere are ways for her to emancipate herself, and get the parental information requirement for FAFSA waived. That process is a PITA though. Have you thought about offering Rose a place to stay while she is in college? I think the cheapest option would be for Rose to go to community college for two years while she works through getting funding. Does she know what she wants to do? One of the best places I have found to make an informed career choice is bls.gov.",
            "This girl and your relationship with her are important and valuable, but let's not everybody forget that the most important and valuable relationship here is the spouse. \n\nWhat advice would /r/relationships give if the husband wrote in about the same situation? \"Your wife should <what would we suggest?> if she respects you.\"\n\nSome initial advice from that perspective: listen to and empathetically validate (without judging correctness) both his *opinions* about the girl and his *feelings* about your disagreement.\n\nYou're getting a lot of ammo here to prove that you're \"right.\" But in the long run, it's more important to be loving than right. Work to convince him, sure, but be really wary of using that ammo to shoot him personally, or worse, *pushing ahead with actions you know he disagrees with*.  That would be solidly disrespectful... are you willing to do that to your marriage, for the sake of this girl?",
            "As an 18-year old who grew up in a conservative Christian family (ie. no Trick-or-Treating because \"Halloween is the Devil's holiday\"--and no Harry Potter, because \"it's about witchcraft!!\") I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to be able to experience normal childhood or teenage activities. While I understand your husband's hesitation as a parent, I sympathize with Rose. It's an incredibly alienating and lonesome feeling to know that the only thing holding you back from going to college or making choices about your lifestyle is your own parents. From a young age, American culture tells children and teens that parents are supposed to support you and your choices. The dissonance between strict religious parenting and the parental models around Rose probably prompted her to go to you. Rose sounds like a level-headed 16-year old who is ready to make her own decisions. As long as she's careful not to leave traces of Mexican food or primer on her clothes, I'm sure her partaking in these normal activities won't hurt her relationship with her parents, and she'll definitely appreciate you for the supportive environment you've provided her with. ",
            "Even if you don't give her makeup or curry, I bet you would really help by giving her ideas. The idea that she chooses her own path. That her parents' job is to prepare her to be an independent adult in the real world. (Let her reach the conclusion that they've failed her on her own.) That she can have likes and dislikes and passions. That there are a thousand religions out there, and they all sincerely believe that their way is correct. \n\nAnd heck, maybe your daughter could wear very modest clothes and no makeup and eat whatever isn't considered Satanic sometimes, and show her friend that she can still be smart and powerful and feminist while choosing to do those things. That the choosing is the point. The friend probably feels ashamed sometimes because of how differently she was raised, and needs reassurance that she can choose to keep some of her upbringing, or none of it, or most of it, as long as it's honestly what's going to make her the most happy.",
            "As a girl from a religious cult family, thank you for feeling concerned for this girl. You are a wonderful person. Listen to the advice from the top comments: avoid legal trouble, but make your home a safe place for Rose to be.",
            "There's this weird attitude in the US that parents own their children and can control their development and everything about them until they're 18. While there is some aspect of parenting in that, there also needs to be the understanding of autonomy of the child, which I think a lot of parents get right. Her's don't. I say this to argue your husband's POV. I think you are right to support her autonomy as a child with rights from your position. Her parents do not own her. Parents do not own children. They raise them (Look up UN Convention on the rights of the child. Some interesting ideas about this kind of thing).\n\nYou can support her rights as a child, not as an adult (alcoholic beverages), to develop into someone who can navigate this world. Her parents are being neglectful in not allowing her that. You have a great opportunity to help her do so. \n\nLike other posters have said, you have to tread lightly and facilitating it through your daughter is probably the best way. But do let her know that you are available for her to ask questions, to be a sounding board, to have adult support, and other appropriate things that won't put her at real risk with her parents. Be a mentor. Make sure your daughter understands that you have to tread lightly but that you do wish to support her friend and it isn't as a parent, but as a mentor. Make sure she understands what that means and that there are limits to what each of you can do, and that many normal teenage things that she may be allowed to do may need to be off the table with her friend because they would put her at serious risk of isolation and jeopardy of being able to go to college and leave when she is 18.",

It might feel like it's not your place. But remember: imposing all these crazy restrictions wasn't really her parents' place, either. She's a young woman now, not a toddler. While her legal rights are limited, we all know that *morally,* it is well within her rights to want to wear lipstick.\n\nWith the exception of the wine, there isn't a damn thing her parents could do to you over any of this. Worst case, they stop letting her come over. There's no law that says you can't feed somebody else's kid Chinese food. ",

            "In general, parents should be given broad leeway to raise their child as they see fit. They are given the benefit of the doubt in these things because it is assumed they are looking out for their children with pure intentions.\n\nHowever, there's a line. Some things are objectively bad for the child, and at some point, that becomes child abuse. Once that happens, all the other decisions the parent wants to make for their child are called into question. Abusive parents forfeit the benefit of the doubt that they are trying to do what's best for the child.\n\nIn Rose's case, one could overlook all of the items you mentioned as potentially reasonable parenting decisions, **until** they banned her from even exploring the possibility of further education. In my opinion, that is simply abuse, with no possible justification. Given that one very abusive position, you are under no obligation to support *any* of their other questionable parenting decisions.\n\nAs an analogy, consider child A who has very strict diet considerations but otherwise loving parents, vs child B who has very strict diet considerations and is being physically or sexually abused by her parents. In child A's case, I think it's reasonable to consider her parents' wishes with regards to diet. In child B's case, the diet restrictions are put in an entirely different light and do not need to be considered.",
            "To be perfectly frank, what her parents are doing to her and the other girls in the family should be considered a form of child abuse and it disgusts me that people like this can shield themselves from being prosecuted because of \"religion\". We're always calling the middle east out for their treatment of women, especially when they deny them education and force them to become servants to their husbands, but we let the same bullshit fly in our own countries because, apparently, it's ok if you're motivated by a religion other than Islam. \n\nWhat they're doing to this girl is mental and emotional abuse and it's so clear from your post that she's trying to escape it and give herself a better life. If she's undermining them by lying and sneaking around to try and get into college then she's obviously begun to weigh the pros and cons of doing so and is coming to the conclusion that she would rather leave her family to have a happy life of her own than stay with them and be sucked into a life she's not happy with. I wouldn't necessarily give her alcohol if she's under the legal age limit (or just come to Canada, the legal age is 18-19!), but definitely help her with the rest. If you don't continue to help her, very soon her life will be nothing more than becoming a servant and brood mare for some equally brainwashed man and this cycle of brainwashing and abuse will continue to all of their children as well. Someone needs to step up and break the cycle - I'm very happy that it's been you. \n\nIf you're interested, there's a very good podcast out there of Sam Harris interviewing Megan Phelps-Roper, a former member of the Westborough Baptist Church, which goes into detail about her upbringing in a brainwashy-type cult such as this one.

But what she likely needs to do is the same thing I had to, apply for independent student status. What is required for this is three typed letters from respectable sources ( I.E. Adults, such as yourself, who know her situation. Teachers work very well too. So yeah, she will need three adults to write her situation, that they are aware of it, and that independent student status is a necessity for her to be able to go to school. Then she will need to go to the IRS office and get a 'verification of non-filing', it's just a piece of paper that states she's never filed taxes.

Explain your reasoning behind the denial, though. However, it would also worry me that she would have zero experience with alcohol coming from an anti-alcohol family going into college. When it comes time for her to leave, I think you, and possibly your daughter, should sit down and talk to her about alcohol. Don't try to scare her, just be realistic with her about drinking alcohol.

Like changing in to clothes at school, but forgetting to change out before getting home.  You can tell her you won't stop her from wearing make-up, and tampons, but you won't help facilitate this.  Again, she's risking college education for some really minor things.\n\nFor the swimsuit, can she not even wear a one-piece?  If she can, just show her how to swim in that, but if she always changes out and leaves the swimsuit at your place, then there's really no harm in letting her wear what she wants.  NO PICTURES.  Not of anything she does at your place.  They will find their way to social media.\n\nI'd let her eat what she wants, it's pretty easy for her to not get caught, and it's her body which is something she needs to start taking control of.

You don't have to give her alcohol to teach her about it. I would focus on teaching her health body image and drawing her own conclusion.

When I was about that age, some trusted adults (family friends etc) started to figure out what the score was with my parents and took pity on me. They started coming up with reasons to get me out of the house and away from my parents, taking me to experience some (safe, innocuous) things my parents wouldn't have allowed, and just talking to me.\n\nIt was such a hugely valuable thing to me at that age to be able talk to these adults who treated me with some dignity and respect and trusted me to be able to make some choices for myself.",

It sounds as if that's a bit dodgey in general there? Here in Europe a lot of children are brought up to drink alcohol responsibly and enjoy it and they learn to respect it. But don't do that if it's actually illegal there.\n\nI don't see why she can't be given tampons as long as she's told how to use them properly! It's impossible to do some things wearing a pad. And if she hides the trash properly her parents might not find out.\n\nIt's good that you want to help her but while she's still a child you should be careful about going against her parents wishes, even if they seem stupid. They might disown her and cut you off if they find out you do these things. So helping her get into college (if she starts when she's an adult) is fine. But like someone else mentioned, you 'don't know' if the girls are trying on makeup in your daughters room, you might not notice some leftovers go missing or some tampons go missing.

            "We obviously can't tell you what to do...in the end you need to set boundaries. For example giving her alcohol could turn out horribly for you if someone found out, BUT what's to stop her from having a drink with her friend? Nothing. You can't check on everything. That's my stance on this. About the other stuff...none of it should have any legal consequences, but I'm not an expert.  \n  \nAs for undermining the parents' authority. As you said, you are already doing that and we can all agree that SOME form of parenting needs to be undermined. They effectively want her to be a stupid little stay at home mom soon. They are preventing her from getting an education. To me that in itself should be legally punishable. I'm so sorry that the education system in the US sucks so much...unfortunately there is not much she can do until she turns 18, right? Maybe go to another country, study there, if possible. I dunno. Anyway you're doing good, just be careful. I may assume that your husband is not so much concerned about the undermining part, but more about the \"omg, there are religious nutjobs with pitchforks, torches and GUNS on our lawn!!!!\" ;)",

A friend of mine did that, so she was able to do FAFSA. Can you help her find a social worker or someone like that to help her navigate that? Also, are you prepared to allow her to live with you and provide support? Even though my friend was able to get access to financial aid, she still had to navigate university holidays and summer break. She said she was often homeless during these times.",
            "How do you know about these rules? Did the parents allow her to visit only after you were informed of all the no-no's or did you hear about them through your daughter and Rose? If it is the latter, I would say just live your life normally and offer things that you would to any other teenage guest in your house. There is deniability there if you need it. That doesn't solve the problem of her being banned from your house when she gets caught though, because she will. What does Rose think will happen? Is she sure that she will be disowned and kicked out? If so, it is your responsibility at that point to help her because you facilitated the behaviors that caused it. I would worry that there would be scarier consequences, though, like others have mentioned. I wouldn't be surprised if the solution to these kinds of \"sins\" would be isolation and retraining, not kicking her out of the house.\n\nI think if I were you I would have a heart to heart with Rose and get as many of her thoughts and opinions on the possible outcomes as you can. Then, contact a group that helps children in her situation escape, they may have some strategies that have worked before. Combine info from these sources and come to table with your husband to discuss what you have learned. Real information as opposed to speculation or guesswork will help you make a good decision for your family as well as Rose. You may be signing your family up for a long term or possibly lifetime relationship/commitment to this girl and they have the right to know what you are getting them in to. As sad as the situation is, your first priority is the happiness of your own family. \n\nFrom a purely emotional standpoint, I would do everything in my power to help her (sounds like you really enjoy her as a person and she is a welcome addition to your family) and would plan on inviting her to an annual Foods from around the World Christmas celebration every year forever, which would include wine after she turns 21!!",

They want to deprive her of education and with it the tools to support herself on her own. So that she would be a slave to some man. I have a daughter too, and the thought of this makes my blood boil.\n\nSo forget the wishes of those other parents. They are stunting their daughter's growth into adulthood and that is just wrong.

The fact that they wish to restrict her freedoms and education would be awful regardless of motivations. If they believed this and encouraged it but let her choose, that'd be different, but they're taking away basic freedoms. \n\nCould your family help this girl that far?",
            "I can see your points as well as your husbands.  The thing you two have in common is wishing to help Rose out.  Now, how to do that is the big question.\n\n\nI think the answer lies in examining whether or not you believe that Rose's parents do her any good and deserve some credit.  Would you rather see Rose go into a foster situation or would you say she's safe enough for the short period left before she could go off to college and make her own life?\n\n\nIdeally, I think what you do with your own daughter, in terms of wine once or twice a month, is somehow the answer for Rose.  I don't think it's realistic to indulge her every whim at all times, but occasionally exposing her to something 'worldly' would be good.  If Rose wants more typical experiences, she needs to be open to multiple relationships and a social group that supports that -- not just one family.\n\n\nAlso, don't compromise your legal position.  If your laws state that providing alcohol to minors (who are not your kin) is a crime == don't do it.  \n\n\nAlso, I'd avoid conflicts with the parents.  Rose will suffer from this.  You do not want to trigger the shunning.  That is a part of her journey that needs to be within her control because frankly she has to live with it 100% of the time.\n\nThough, I don't advocate any type of church, there may be some protestant pastor out there how would be willing to advise you.  Pastors have the benefit of being educated in the ways of cults and the ways that religion can be toxic to people and families -- that said, be sure to do your homework because you don't want to talk to someone of a denomation that is legalistic and xenophobic like the one Rose has been brought up in.  A lot of modern pastors are trained counsellors with a great skillset.  Considering the situation, they shouldn't try to push any religion on you either.\n\n\nI wish you guys all the best.  I know what it is like to grow up in a strict and cult-like religion and to be inevitably shunned for things that really are part of normal development and teenage experimentation.  I know that despite the simplicity of what needs to happen is easily apparent, that the emotions and consequences are a lifelong complexity to heal from.  That said, we all have a choice to make.

They are the American Taliban and it is their loss if they punish their daughter for seeking an education. The girl deserves better, and you are her salvation. Good job OP. You're doing it right.

Once she moves out she'll be able to do all these things on her own but since she's a minor you need to be careful with her parents. It would be seen as very disrespectful to them. ",
            "She needs to be super careful till she is 18. At 16, they can claim she ran away from home and have her dragged back by police, or move her to somewhere isolated. At 18, the police will shake their heads and do nothing.\n\nThere may be support groups around who are ex-members of her church, or a church similar to hers. It could be very helpful to her to get in touch with these people.\n\nI also wonder if at age 18, would she be able to legally compel her parents to give up the FAFSA info? It may be worth talking to a lawyer about? \n\nThe main thing is that she's already never going to experience normal teenage life. It's a hallmark of teenagers to be impatient for adult freedoms, in her case that is exacerbated by not even having normal freedoms. But impulsiveness in this circumstance could set her much farther back than what a typical teenager risks when defying their parents. \n\nTwo years seems like forever when you're 16, but she needs more than anything to keep her head down and get her ducks in a row. Some defiances of her parents rules may help with this, but as others have pointed out you and she both need to be very careful about what you enable. All her careful plans will be useless if her parents move her out of state to a \"retreat\". \n\nSome foods can change the way you smell - so if she wants to try food she should be very careful of what she tries. If she tries a bathing suit on, she needs to remember to keep out of the sun lest she have to explain an odd sunburn pattern. Test make-up and make-up remover on your daughter first, to make sure it can be fully removed, and also don't forget to patch test before applying it because an allergic reaction would be awkward to explain too.\n\nWine - well, it's tricky. Does she want to get drunk, or does she just want to try a few sips to defy her parents? Personally I wouldn't, just because of the liability it puts you both at - her parents can't do anything to you if they find out she wore make-up or a bikini but they can definitely come after you for the alcohol.\n\n",

(Parents had issues w me only.)\n\nAnyway, I went to a very small college that accepted that I was an independent student with no parents. Yes, it took some work, but they did what had to be done. I ended up working for the financial aid office all 4 years to show my gratitude and help others. \n\nIt isn't impossible. It can be done. Especially in smaller colleges with more leeway and personal touch. For her, she might want to consider getting emancipated if her parents are going to cut her out in two years anyway as it will legally help her in so many ways and will help her a lot with college. Then, she can make her own decisions and you don't have to be responsible for her disobeying her parents. \n\nI would recommend you get her in touch with her school therapist and make sure the therapist keeps confidentiality so she can discuss her options.

This could be what saves her from a life of what she's already know for 16 years...\n\nTo give more perspective - \nOP, I grew up in an extremely strict Mormon household. We were fundamentalists, but I was so isolated from the world that I did not learn very normal or basic things until years after I left home. For example, I  was never allowed to have non Mormon friends, I couldn't so much as step into my own back yard without permission and an older sibling to watch over me until I was around 19, etc.  not nearly as bad as rose. But, I lost out on so many importa social and cultural developments that even today I, 6 years since I've been on my own and out of that environment, I struggle greatly with any social interactions and normal social behaviors like empathy, as bad as that sounds. I have pretty bad anxiety from all things social because I don't know how to deal with it. It doesn't come to me naturally. \n\nGiving this young girl a safe place to learn very normal things, where her family can't further punish her for natural curiosity, makes you a saint. Don't give up on her. If I struggle with any and all things social and cultural even today, and I didn't have it nearly as bad as rose, imagine how much harder it will be for her than it has been for me. I cannot emphasize enough how many negative psychological and emotional effects there are from growing up in extremely restrictive and insulated households. Save her by giving her a safe place outlet and helping guide her in normal things. \n\nNormally I would say people don't have a right to interfere with other people's kids, but I definitely consider that life on par with abuse. I often have very bad anger and flashbacks over my own childhood. Help rose move on from that. ",

Parents have a responsibility to protect them but allow them to grow in to their own people, not little brainwashed mini-me(s).  \n\nIf this cult (and let's be honest, that's what it is) said that husbands impregnated their own daughters, would he still be so quick to say they have a right to do what they want with their kids?  Based on their other prehistoric beliefs it wouldn't take much prying to discover they believed in physical abuse as reprimand.  \n\nBeyond hypothesising about physical abuse, there is clear psychological abuse already going on.  They are limiting their daughter's educational and personal growth opportunities and threatening her with abandonment if she doesn't follow their wishes.  That is emotional abuse.  She is being psychologically manipulated.  If your husband can't see that, then I'd question his integrity as a person.\n\n",
            "Let me start off by saying that I've always prided myself of being moral. Also, I believe that parents have the right to raise their kids however they want.\n\nWith that said... I feel like most things are similar to science: there's that one exception.\n\nSure, their parents have the right to raise Rose however they want. I can't say anything. But if her parents were to raise her as a racist/extremist, I'd interfere if I could. Maybe not actively, but support her if she starts doubting/rebelling. \n\nI'd definitely do all of the above except the alcohol part due to legal reasons. Tell your husband exactly what I said.",
            "I believe she could declare her self free from her parents imanciplate( totally spelled wrong) so she is no longer needs her parents info for fasfa. At least you can do it in NY.",
            "Definitely help her and let her partake in all of those things you listed! When you said \"sinful\" activities I thought you meant something legitimately sinful, not ethnic food lol. None of these things are harmful and arguably necessary for a teenage girl to experience in order to grow up normally! \n\nYou probably know a lot more about the FAFSA thing than I do but maybe there's someone you can contact in these situations where parents refuse to provide their information and the child can bypass it somehow.",
            "Morally you're doing the right thing, especially since she has expressed the desire to leave her family.\n\nLegally, you're setting your self up for a huge lawsuit. Help the girl as an adviser capacity for college needs but do not encourage \"sinful\" behavior in your home- however ridiculous you might view it. Her parents could slap you with a child endangerment lawsuit, even if its false.\n\nYou can teach her about coping mechanisms to handle her situation or find a support group for her, but honestly she's asking too much of you and your family already without understanding real-world repercussions. \n\nThere's not much you can do to help her aside from being a free adviser since her parents aren't outwardly abusing her.

            "Would she be able to become emancipated?",
            "I'd side with your husband to an extent. A lot of it is fine to let the friend experience - what you have for dinner is your business, make-up can be washed off, if the girls want to play dress up and try on other clothes/bikinis who cares. Wine would simply be wrong. My own kid has only tried a sip here and there and that's it - if I found out she was being fed alcohol at a friend's home she wouldn't be going there again and I'd be tempted to call social services. The tampon thing, dunno, overnight and only in your home (not left in to return home) probably not an issue, if there's no chance of it making any physical change ... you'd feel a lot less heroic if she gets murdered by some crazy uncle just because she's not a virgin, or even if her whole family feels shamed or cuts her off or whatever because you decided your culture is better. In two years though, game on. Whatever she asks for, it'll be nice for her to have support.",
            "Unfortunately, both you and your husband are right.\n\nI say let her explore since she's already chosen to go down the path of disobedience by going to college. It's better now with someone to reign her in than like most asshat kids that go crazy because of the sudden freedom.\n\nBut you also could get into some sort of weird trouble. Who knows how things could get twisted and it could be taken way way out of context.",
            "This may be a stupid suggestion, but what does community college look like in your state? I'm in Oregon and a law recently passed that for qualifying students tuition is free in community colleges. I know cc may not be the most glamorous, but she can get her associate's while she waits for FASFA to consider her independent.",
            "She sounds like she has already seen through most of their lies and brainwashing as soon as she was told she can't go to college.\n\nI would say give her all the help she wants and needs, and I would definitely say bring up the offer of her moving in with you when shit hits the fan.",
            "I am so excited to answer this! BUT I am at work so need maybe up to 24 hours? I hope that you will still read my opinion as I really value those years. I am 45 and grew up in the middle of nowhere/beautiful place in Scotland! Now living successfully in London, life isn't an easy thing but I hope I can help from maybe a completely different cultural background.",

            "Do you mind if i ask what denomination Rose's family is from. I'm a non-denominational christian and all of those \"sinful\" things you listed seem completely normal to me. Quite frankly, I'm appalled by Rose's parents not supporting their OWN DAUGHTERS education. ",
            "I didn't read through all the comments, so someone else might have already mentioned this. At least when I applied for FAFSA, if you did not live with your parents their information was not required. I had to do it this way and was eligible for aid because my own single income was so low. Good luck to her. ",
            "On the FAFSA form, state that you are not a dependant of anyone. If they're cutting you off, you aren't. If they claim you as a dependant, they have to prove you are their dependant. Since you're cut off, they can't. You don't need family information.\n\n\nAm I taking crazy pills or are all you people dealing with a totally different FAFSA than the one that exists in real life? Parents can't stop you from getting FAFSA.",
            "Not a parent, but my initial reaction is: \n\n1) Woohoo on you for helping this sheltered child\n\n2) Like you, I think I'd draw the line at alcohol, because that's a legal issue that the parents could easily bring down the law on you for, but as far as everything else, as long as you're fine with Rose's parents disapproval and whatever they may say/do about it, and Rose is aware of the risk, there's nothing \"harmful\" there. ",
            "I totally understand your reservations...but if you didn't know her religious background then why would any of those things(except the drinking) be out of the ordinary?\n\nIf she and your daughter hangout in your daughters room and she happens to put on make-up, well that is totally out of your control. If she wears a bikini in your house while you're not there...if she eats a samosa because she CHOOSES to eat it herself (I could go on), how can you enforce rules that you don't really know the full extent of? When I was 16 my friends and I would entertain ourselves, presumably you aren't part of your 16 year old daughters friendship circle? \n\nThe flip side is, that her parents may attempt to blame you or your daughter for leading her astray and stop her from being at your house. However, it sounds like these are things she wants to explore and not something she will run home to her parents about.\n\nI would say, treat her like you would treat any of your daughters other friends. ",
            "Really wonderful what youre doing for her, you could always get non alcoholic wine?",
            "Hey there! Y'all are wonderful people :) as the top comment suggests, there may be ramifications to your decisions if they find out. I would think about when whether or not you're willing to take her in and help her through the process of emancipation if indeed you'll provide alcohol or other serious things her parents may disown her for. Any help at all for such a situation is usually great! But some things may be too far for the parents and they could seek legal action as well (assuming they can find a lawyer who isn't the devil's henchman). You're doing great so far! But just think it through because we all like to leap without looking when we see someone in trouble :/",
            "I feel like the college thing is great. The other stuff I would be super careful, especially drinking because they can have you arrested for that. IANAL but underage drinking seems like a serious offense. It might be better to just talk to rose about drinking responsibly so she doesn't get hurt when she goes to school. Explain that there's nothing wrong with alcohol and that she shouldn't let anyone pressure her.",
            "I think what you are doing is awesome, but please be aware of the repercussions Rose could face. If her family found out there could be a chance she could be kicked out and disowned before the whole college thing is a problem. If that happens maybe have her move in with you and become her foster parents or maybe she could move in with a less crazy relative? Either way I wish you and her the best of luck!",
            "There's enough advice in here to go around, but I just wanted to say that I am really happy you're there to hopefully break the cycle of abuse.  Yeah, I said it, I consider what her parents are doing to her as abuse.",
            "I think your husband is right on this. I think you can help her with preparing for college but you should not condone her doing any of those things her parents have forbidden her from doing in your house or with you and your daughter. I agree that these restrictions they've placed on her are ridiculous, but they are still her parents and it is not your place to decide how they raise their daughter. To them, this is a \"normal\" way of raising a child and your way of raising a child is strange (although I'm sure they would use other words) and is not what they think is best for their daughter. From your perspective, the way you raise your daughter is normal and you might not like it if another family began introducing your daughter to things which you find strange and think are bad for your daughter (even if your daughter suggested them). Normal is relevant and to this girl's parents, you letting her daughter eat Thai food might be the equivalent for you of another family teaching your daughter satanism. If she wants to do these things on her own then that's fine, but just because they're legal doesn't mean you should let her do them is your house (and don't give her wine obviously).\n\n\nWhen she's 18 it would be fine, but until then you should be respectful of her parents' parenting decisions as long as they don't endanger their daughter (which it doesn't sound like they do)",
            "You should undermine their parenting ",
            "The ones I feel are acceptable to allow her to experience is ethnic foods, and instead of bikini - learning how to swim.  You can show her different types of pads that aren't as bulky, for instance, so you're not exactly defying her parents and if she chooses to get tampons from your daughter... how would you know? \n\nI would try to maintain as much of a supporting role while still respecting her parents wishes until she is 18. However, if she truly wants to separate from them then she could ask you for support to find a way to become emancipated from them - that also may help with the college/university admissions. \n\nI think it's one of those cases where it would be good to talk to her about toeing the line for the greater good, and learning how to overcome obstacles without disrespecting her parents who provide for her. It is part of her culture and some of the things she wants to do are not of any real benefit to her - make up, wine, bikinis... those are all risky teen behaviours and not of a benefit to her future. Learning how to swim, what ethnic foods taste like, and getting a higher education can only benefit her future so in my opinion acceptable. \n\nTread carefully and don't say yes to everything just because you're helping her with the college admission stuff. ",
            "So because you're ok with what she wants to do you let her do it. \nBut basically it comes down to what her parents want. She's not 18 and she is not living with you and you don't have legal gaurdianship over her. If things are so bad at home and want to help so much then call Social Services and take her in under a foster care type situation. \nIf not then holy crap respect her parents desicion a and authority in her life. You would expect other parents to respect yours. \n",
            "I'd be counseling rose on how to get emancipated and also how to get it in writing that there will be no college support. she's gonna be disowned anyway, may as well prepare ahead of time. with documentation of unwillingness to pay for college and threats of disowning, it should be easier to do FAFSA without parental info",
            "Just to address some FAFSA things: \n\nYou should look at her gaining emancipation from her parents. She needs a job and some paperwork, but she wouldn't need her parents for FAFSA.\n\nIf they kicked her out she can claim homeless teen. It would also keep her from having to put her parents on the FAFSA. \n\nAnother option, I joined the military so I don't have to list my parents on my FAFSA. \n\nThere are ways to not have to list your parents on your FAFSA but Rose will need help navigating the situation.",
            "I just want to thank you for what you're doing. Its so amazing and awesome that your family is helping her escape something shes being forced into but doesn't want!! ",
            "I'm with your husband. This isn't your kid. You don't get to decide which ideals she should follow or how she's raised. Even if the vast majority of us would agree that what you want for her is far better than what her parents are allowing-- that's not your decision to make.\n\nWhat if some other parent had different ideals from yours, and secretly let your kids do those things you've disallowed? Their opinion of what kids should be allowed to do is no more valid than yours.",
            "Please let her decide for herself. My parents were very religious and I was brought up with some insane rules and in some cases just deprived of normal experiences (they were also abusive). I would have gone nuts if I hadn't been able to choose to have those experiences at friends' houses.\n\nI think there's a line between a) choosing how to raise your child and b) depriving them of normal experiences. \n\nMake-up, food and tampons should be her choice. Not yours or your husband's but HER choice to make when away from her crazy parents. ",
            "Have you talked to her and your daughter about your fears of her going off the rails with the sudden freedom. See if you and they can come up with way to keep in it all safe but still free. Learn about moderation and keep eye out for eachother. She's likely lived with demands but not with someone asking for her opinion. So word it the right way.\n\nDepending how cultish maybe get her self defence classes or help memorise legal numbers or escape plans and how to deal with stalkers. ",
            "If emancipation is an option, I'd suggest it. My family refused to give me their info for the FAFSA, and I ended up with private loans at 10.5 percent interest.  ",
            "I think there are two things going on here. One is short term, one is long term. Rose should absolutely get an education. Assisting her with paperwork because her parents suck is the right thing to do. She understands the risks, and accepts them to live her life to the fullest. Good on you.\n\n2. life experiences. All the things you've mentioned, make up, bikini's, ethnic food, wine, feminine hygiene products, those are all things that are not critical right now. One can live a full life with one piece bikini's, maxipads, and country style cooking. It does still suck her parents are like this, but I think you risk her future in terms of exploring things today. Tell Rose she's a great kid with a good head on her shoulders and you want to help her have a bright future. That being said, it isn't your place to defy her parents, even though you understand they are being overly restrictive. Tell her you are doing the school stuff because you feel it affects her future, and she does need help. Tell her the other stuff, she has a long long life ahead of her to do and experience things, and she just needs to hold on until she has more independence and freedom from her parents.\n\nYou should really be thinking minimal interference. If it wasn't a big issue like college, you shouldn't interfere at all. Having puritanical restrictions isn't child abuse, its just shitty parenting.",
            "I think you should sit down with Rose and let her know what is okay and what isn't. You should come up with a plan and let her know that illegal activities, such as wine, drugs, etc are not acceptable in the house because it risks your job.",
            "She's a minor,  do not get involved in these things. They have ultimate control over Rose and can make her life a living he'll.  Being grounded permanently for two years or being shipped off to boarding school are real possibilities. \n\nIf her parents make her life a living he'll you will regret helping out. ",
            "Absolutely no on the alcohol. Her parents could get you arrested if they found out. I'd also disagree with the two piece, because the benefits don't outweigh the risks. Makeup and even tampons can be dangerous too because her parents might find out. Since she's still a minor, her parents might forbid her from coming over to your place. It seems like she really needs this \"safe space\" you created for her. Jeopardizing it would cause more problems in the long run. Try to explain that to her, and offer to help her experience these things once she goes to college.",
            "I know it's not the main question here, but I wanted to point out that there is a way to get money from FAFSA without parental input. If her parents will not be supporting her in college, she can call them and explain that and if she can prove it, she can possibly get the full amount covered. ",
            "You should let her do all of this except have wine, there won't be any legal repercussions because none of it is illegal.",

            "Growing up, my friend's mom went Born-Again Christian. Here's a story: We learned this one night my friend C and I were prompted by my Dad to go \"Pumpkin' Stealin.\" I mean, I get where my Dad was coming from--he thought it to be fun misadventure--at no time did I think my Dad condoned all pilfering. No. It was more sneaking into farm fields and snagging a pumpkin. Anyway I was lumpy and the farmer was home and saw me all being lumpy in his field. When my Dad pulled back up to collect us he got berated and what not and drove off. The farmer pulled his lisc. # and a bit later a cop showed up to the house and what not, who then called my friend C's mom. \n\nC's mom showed up livid, and preaching endlessly about how we were terrible sinners and setting a terrible example for her Christ-like son. The same Christ-like son who thought going pumpkin stealing was the greatest novelty since sliced bread. \n\nAnyway. This lady never really forgave my parents for this little blip. She even went as far as refused to allow us to be friends for about a year or so. He was never allowed over at my house again. And then, for a long time, I was only allowed to go to his house if also tagging along to Church. \n\nAnyway. C and I stayed friend through high school (though he was home school). Yet, despite his mother's christian indoctrination, he ended sleeping with his 1st girlfriend at 15/16, then off to smoke weed and drink, then off to do opiates, and then entire time degrading into a snarky asshat. I mean, C talked back to everyone, all of the time, about everything. It became intolerable to be around him (and so I stopped). \n\nNow, C is a bit better. He got off the drugs. Still somehow believes all the church nonsense but hasn't actually gone, nor followed any of Christian practices basically ever. His brother last I heard was in his early thirties, still living at home, had two DUIs (he actual wrecked into a guardrail, lost a wheel, and continued to drive unknowingly) and a prescription/coke problem. \n\nWhat I'm saying is--despite my Dad being a goofball, the religious kid ended up being the asshole. He's the one that got me into pot smoking! Ha. \n\nMaybe have a candid conversation with your daughter, explain you are going to play \"dumb\" about some of their activities--you know, no idea they snuck Tandoori chicken and Skype'd a boy. Ugh. The humanity. \n\nAlso, I'd recommend her the book Blue Like Jazz by Donald Miller; its for a Christian audience, but is fairly \"liberal\" in its reasoning. I think it would resonate with her background, while also leading her to make her own decisions in a healthy way. \n",
            ">Wine - This is tricky. Because I work in a college, I see first hand how kids from overly sheltered families go crazy with alcohol when they get to college. My husband and I want to avoid this with Lily, so we let her have a small amount of wine with dinner 1-2 times a month. Well, Rose wants to try alcohol (also a huge no-no) with Lily. Unfortunately, I don't want to risk giving alcohol to a minor and I plan on declining this request.\n\nYou can still talk with Rose about responsible alcohol usage.  Tell her what you've seen and talk about your own alcohol usage.  My DH and I like to drink, but it's rare for us to do it out of the house because we're cheap, but I have talked about how it's OK for someone to have a beer or maybe two with a meal and then drive, but it's important not to drink more than that because impaired driving is bad.  \n\n\n",
            "She's going to be like fish in a barrel for the dudes at the college she'll attend. See it all the time in my country (especially muslim and christian girls who leave home for college).

            "Dangerous game. \n\nI agree with the college thing. That is her decision, for adult years and it's her name on the applications. \n\nBut you are talking about severely undermining someone's wishes for their children. We aren't talking, \"I provide love for a child of alcoholics\". It's a justification based on not agreeing with their way of life. \n\nYou are also getting your information from a 16 year old who is invariably adding their own desires to the tales of their upbringing. \n\nThink of it this way... Some parents have the philosophy that teenage drinking is OK at their home, because they are going to drink anyway, right? So they welcome your teenage daughter to their home, allow her lies and she gets drunk. \n\nWhat's the harm, right? I mean, it's not your desires for your child so someone has decided better than you. \n\nI don't think supporting her behaviour is in the best interest of her life. ",

            "It's a really tough one. I'd really want to allow it, too, but I think your husband is right to an extent. I don't think I'd allow things like the make up and the swimsuit because it does have connotations to the less open minded. We're all safe in the knowledge that wearing make up or a bikini isn't an expression of sexual intent by default, but western societies do seem to have an innate fear of sexuality in their young women and her church is an extreme rxample of that. That makes it much more dangerous a rule to allow her to break in your presence than the others. You don't want them to get wind of it and twist your motives.\n\nI would encourage her to try to get an understanding of other cultures, though, and share in unfamiliar foods and music, or similar. \n\nThe reason I say this is because for her personal growth, understanding culture will be more broadly beneficial to her than trying on a shade of lipstick. She'll be eighteen soon, and then she can make her own style choices. In the meantime, they can't realistically accuse you of sexual deviance for sharing your family's curry night.",
            ">However, my husband is wary of allowing Rose these experiences in our home. He thinks that we are explicitly undermining Rose's parents and no matter how crazy they are, it's still their right to raise Rose how they see fit until she turns 18.\n\n\nYour husband is right.\n\nNo matter how much you may disagree with the way her parents are raising her she is their child not yours.\n\nEdit:  If the situation were reversed, how would you feel about them allowing your child to do things they knew you disapproved of?",
            "No one will ever see this comment but I have to say it. I find the idea of helping another person's child disobey their family's principals just because you don't agree deplorable, reprehensible and hypocritical. How the hell would you feel if some one didn't agree with the way you raise your children and the restrictions you put on them?\n\nTwo piece bathing suit? Make up? These are all things that aid in sexualizing a person. You are living in denial if you think revealing more skin isn't sexualizing. Not to mention make up makes young girls look older and emulates arousal with red lips and flushed cheeks.\n\nTampons is not just about \"keeping your vagina\" pure. It's also about toxic shock and being brand new to feminine hygiene. Limited in bathroom breaks and suspectable to peer shaming (girls with tampons were called sluts because kids thought it meant you didn't have a hymen anymore). \n\nThe wine is relatively obvious and illegal. But hey you clearly think your morals supersede that of others and you feel entitled to \"save\" other people's kids from their parents.\n\nI'm shocked not a single person in this thread has stood up for the actual parents and actually addressed the real practicality of putting limiters on certain behaviors. Most of those things have very little to do with religion and maybe if you didn't slather it in prejudice and took their beliefs out of the equation. You might realize how very wrong what you are doing is.\n\nSeriously how would you feel if another parent gave your kids weed and gave them a place to have sex with other students. Let them dress up in lingerie, took them to get birth control, buy sex toys and watch snuff films? Just because they didn't agree with you that a sixteen year should be restricted or limited from those things. ",

        "selftext": "He is a redditor so I am changing some minor details and names. Apologies in advance for a long story.\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been studying together at university, and while he is studying part time, working part time and engaging heavily in his amateur acting career. While I am studying full time and working part time. We share one subject at uni together. On top of this he is trying to pick up another hobby while looking after his grandfather who is in his final stages in a nursing home. As you can imagine, for the past 6 months he has very little time to cut out of his week to spend with me. None, in fact. I have been fine with this for the most part. I have been driving 45 minutes 3+/- times a week to get to his house so we can steal a few hours together, but he doesn't have time to spare. This is an inconvenience I can live with. \n\n\nHowever he has been asking me to do a lot of other things too; He has frustrated me multiple times with demands that I visit his grandfather (Who does not recognise me) for two hours, which turns in to 4.5 hours. Or help him with a family matter, which lasts 5 hours or so. Every time this happens, he promises he will drive me home, and every time he says he doesn't have time anymore and I need to catch the train home (1 hour + walking). I have spoken to him about how this is unfairly effecting me, and he seems to take it on board, but just forgets again the next time he needs something.  \n\nAfter forcing me to spend $600+ on his best friends' destination wedding, the weekend before we both had two major exams due, He demands that we switch our exam times because he didn't spend enough time studying and he needed the extra day. I concede and he squanders his spare day sleeping because he \"needed it.\" \n\nI take my classes very seriously and I feel very fucked over by his demands. I understand that family matters/best friends are important things, but he has eaten in to hours and hours of my study time, and my grades are dropping. Not only that, but it's effecting my emotional health also. I have expressed to him that it is effecting me badly, but he tells me I'm being very unsympathetic and selfish. \n\n\nWhat's more is that I have about $10K in savings. He recently became aware of this and has demanded that I help him pay his bills because \"we're a team\" (He is broke). I helped him with a few, but drew the line after $500 because he is very irresponsible with money and there's only so much I can pour out before it seriously effects me. He is also demanding that I give him access to my bank account because \"we are in this together\" and he wants to marry me one day so we should \"start sharing now\"\n\n\n\nI don't really know what to do. I want to be a good girlfriend and do what he needs me to do right now, but it's beginning to effect my health. Should I be giving him more money? Am I being selfish with my time and funds? At what point is it reasonable to say no? \n   \n**tl;dr**: Boyfriend is demanding all of my time and money, while making no sacrifices for me. ",

            "I understand how hard it must be to reconcile over 2 years of a good relationship with how he's acting now, but are you really surprised that virtually everyone is begging you to run from this man?

I don't think he's going to go back to the way he was before. If you can't just break it off, maybe make one last ditch effort to get through to him. If he says you're a \"team\" he should be open to communication. ",

He found out and managed to blow through my $8,000 in 6 months time, saying once we got married he would support me so what did it really matter in the long run? After those 6 months were up, he dumped me saying I wasn't going anywhere in life (I hadn't graduated yet) and he needed someone on his level. \n\nI never saw a penny of that money. Don't do it.",

            "I have been with my SO for 5 years, so some of these comments saying \"you're not a team until you're married\" upset me a little bit. You and your boyfriend are not a team, but for an entirely different reason than \"you're not married yet\".\n\nYour boyfriend is, in short, manipulating you. He is manipulating you for your time, your money, and a lifestyle that caters to his. He doesn't get enough time to study for *his* exam, and asks *you* to change *your* exam time as well? Why? What good does that do for either of you? Honestly it doesn't make any sense to me. It benefits neither of you to have you also move your exam time.\n\nAs for the money thing, I actually dealt with something very similar, on a much smaller scale, with my sister. Long story short, she manipulated me to do shit for her when she had no options to do things for herself, found out I had $300 in cash from my birthday, then the very next day asks to borrow money from me. This was when I was 17 years old, and she was 23. I was still in high school, and very traumatized that my sister would ask such a thing from me.\n\nBut here's the thing; I also have 2 older brothers, and I called the oldest one to tell him what had happened, and I was crying about not knowing what to do. His advice was simple; *\"She is broke, and she isn't getting her shit together. Don't let her borrow any more money. If you give her money, you are enabling her behavior of taking money from other people instead of providing for herself. She doesn't understand that money doesn't just appear out of nowhere when you need it. Next time, just say no and walk away. You don't need to explain yourself.\"*\n\nSo, that's my advice to you. My situation happened 3 years ago, and my relationship with my sister is, honestly, irreparable. Of course, there was a lot of manipulation involved that added to the money thing, which is what ultimately ruined the way I feel about her. Whether you want to break up with him or not is up to you, but I would suggest you seriously consider it, as his position in your life is toxic to you. He doesn't seem like the kind of person who keeps his promises, and I fear that he will always tell you that he \"promises\" to change for you, and then never will. And one day, he will eventually say things to turn it against you, \"You want me to change, that's not fair!\" etc.\n\nThink long and hard about that decision. But, really, do not give him any money whatsoever, at least until he gets his shit together.\n\n~~(Also I don't wanna be \"that guy\" but the word \"effect\" is a noun and you were looking for the word \"affect\" in your post sorry I just couldn't ignore it D:)~~",

            "Amazing how bad some of this information is. Firstly you don't need to be married to give someone access to your bank account, like saying a few words changes the meaning of a relationship like hey you said to god that you loved me forever so here's my bank account and all my time because before I wasn't committed cause these words to god only prove my love now. \n\nA relationship isn't based on marriage but more so on how 2 people are and how they act with each other. \n\nFirstly, you should always have your own bank account that your pay comes in and a separate account/joint account to pay bills, food, insurance and rent. Never have a joint credit card either. You never know what life will throw you and the last thing you want is for someone to have access to all your money and savings. \n\nThe important things you should always feel and ask yourself is:\n-Does he make me feel special and happy\n-Does he reciprocate the time and energy I put into this relationship\n-Do I feel loved and wanted in this relationship\n-Does he treat me right\n-Does he take me into consideration\n-Am I happy with him (not future or past but presently)\n\nFrom what you have written it does not seem like a healthy relationship at this time. He is not taking you into consideration, taking time to be with you and love you, he asks for money, and puts you second to his needs. Maybe you had a healthy and loving relationship at one time but this is not healthy or a good relationship. As you mentioned your grades and health is suffering. Being young you do not need this. Just think if you have a future with him and this type of scenario happens, this is how he will re-act, this is not how you want your significant other to treat you when something bad happens as there are always dark moments in relationships. Take 30 minutes and ask yourself those questions and see how you feel. If you feel that he is worth it than you have a long battle ahead of you as you are the 3rd wheel (him and his family first) in his mind. Understandable that one of his family member is dying and he may be acting out of character a bit but disrespecting you, your time and your feelings to the point that he is doing (from the examples you gave us) is just plain wrong and not what a significant other should act towards you. \n\nWhat hits me the hardest is that he is saying ya I will marry you so give me your money. Marriage is supposed to be a loving topic that you cherish and talk about with passion and love. Not hey I will marry you so lets have a bank account and give me your money to help me out cause I am broke. Yikes, this does not sound like a healthy relationship at all. Not now anyways.\n\nYou are not being selfish, you can always say no to your significant other as that is what you are allowed to do in a healthy relationship, and your money is yours you worked hard for it and no its not selfish that money is for your education and therefore spoken for and not his to take.\n\nGood luck.",

You're only 21, and already seem to be surpassing him in maturity -- and he's five years older than you. He seems to keep asking for more because you keep giving more. Draw a line. If you're not ready to break up with him altogether, tell him that you need to take a break. Take a few weeks to focus on yourself (exclusively, without wondering whether or not he's okay. He's a grown ass man, he can take care of himself) and see if it makes you feel better. During that break, start work with a therapist to better understand how low self esteem might be a factor in what you're tolerating, and the decisions that you make which you *don't want to do* but keep making anyway. It is not selfish to prioritize yourself and your studies over visiting one of your boyfriend's relatives; he would have no problem making a decision to choose him over you. ",

Saving vs spending everything are very incompatible mindsets. If you get to a point of wanting to give shared finances a go, don't go in with everything right off the bat. Start by opening a shared set of checking and savings accounts separate from your already saved money (and if you get your paycheck direct deposited to the joint account, schedule an auto transfer (or auto-money send so you don't have to link the account) on payday to your personal savings account as well so you don't lose pace on saving if things go badly and that money can't be spent before you get to it. \n  \nGet his attention and make it clear that this is serious, can't wait, and will require his undivided attention for a couple hours so you can have a serious sit down about your relationship. Make it clear that things need to change, that you're happy to take care of one another and support one another, but that it needs to go both ways, that while you understand him needing a bit extra while his grandfather is ailing, it has been *all* about him and you've felt taken for granted, been mislead (with the promise of a ride home), had him change agreements because it suited him even though it adversely affected you...Lay out what changes you need. Focus on the most important change first. All changes at once would be setting him up for failure. Just ask him to really work on the one or possibly two biggest things that affect your level of relationship satisfaction. Once those get under control, move on to the next biggest. \n  \nSide note: you used effect a lot when you should have used affect. The easiest way to remember the difference is \"to*a*ffect is to produce an *e*ffect on.\" So his inconsiderate nature is negatively affecting you, the effect of which is a decline in your relationship satisfaction. \n  \nEdit: phone typos up the wazoo!

Next time you go see him, leave your card at home. Tell him that he has been so selfish that now you have to step back and be selfish and take care of yourself.

You will never change anybody. This is who they are deep down inside. But theyve been perfect the first 3 years we were together. The truth is they had you under their thumb and the mask starts to fall off. Most people aren't generally \"Bad all the time.\" They have good days. If they acted like that from the start than they wouldn't ever be in a relationship.  You will see the true nature of a person eventually. I'm sure if you think back long and hard you'll think of \"Red flags\" at the start but you didn't realize it or you weren't paying attention. I don't care what your going through. It doesn't excuse you or give you the right to abuse somebody or treat them the way he's treated you. I've seen a lot in my young life, maybe even some more than people twice my age have seen.

            " I was ready to be on your side when I read the title,  but then after reading the post,  I'm not so sure.  You titled your post saying that your boyfriend is requiring you to make sacrifices,  leading me to believe that he gave you an ultimatum of \"do this or its over\".   But according to your post that was not the case.   He asked you to go out of your way to spend time with him and you did.   He asked you to help him out with his bills and you did.   And now you are upset and want advice because he is still expecting you to do the things that you have done in the past,  but you don't want to anymore. \n\nMy advice based on this is simple.   Stand up for yourself.   If you don't want to do something.   Don't do it.   You know that when he asks you for some \"quick\"  favor,  it will take twice as long and eat into your study time,  then don't do it.   Don't want to loan him money to pay his bills?   Don't.   It's your money and unless he has access to your accounts,  the o ly way he can get it is from you.   So if you don't like how he manages his money,  don't give him any and it won't be a problem. \n\n And your grades are slipping because you are not prioritizing your studies.   Blaming him for your falling grades isn't fair.   You dont HAVE to do any of these things that he asks.  You worked hard to get where you are and blaming someone else for derailing you from your path isn't going to do anything.   He didnt beat or leave you in a physical stare that makes it impossible to get your work done.   He hasn't taken your books and notes and made it so that you are unable to study.

I've already said she is perfectly fine to buy in to the property provided she contributes the same amount, at which point I will put her on the mortgage, alternatively she is fine to pay her share of the bills and the flat stays in my name. Finances are always a sensitive issue but I wouldn't compromise one inch on things being fair, and the thought of giving someone access to all your savings is insanity. Don't ever be a doormat financially, people will happily walk all over you given the chance.",

This is a time of life when a person needs to be very self-focused... but (a) that shouldn't be to the exclusion of all else, and (b) that shouldn't extend to the assumption that everyone else, including people in the same situation, are likewise focused on him. \n\nI would sit down with him, and have a serious talk about the fact that you need to be concerned with your grades, and your health, ahead of his and his grandfather's, particularly when he himself doesn't seem half as concerned about his own grades as he does about his convenience. The statement, for example, that \"I'd love to come with you, but I need this time to study for a class\" is completely reasonable. **He isn't making sacrifices for you; he's treating your relationship with the same distant and inadequate attention that all of his other overly-stretched pursuits get,** and honestly? \"I sacrifice for him, and he does for me\" isn't the best way to get through school. You both need to focus on your academic concerns and study. And if studying for the class you share doesn't synch up, i.e. you're prepared there and need to study for something else? It doesn't need to be \"studying together\" unless doing so is somehow beneficial to both of you.\n\n**If he doesn't understand this, it might be time to break up.** Your boyfriend multitasks beyond his ability to keep up with things on his own, so nothing gets the specific amount of attention that it needs, and he's looking to you to make up the difference for him. Attending class full-time and working part-time sounds like a minor stretch to me as it is; you really shouldn't be taking on more responsibility.\n\nSpeaking of making up the differences and more responsibility, **do not pay his bills or turn over access to your savings account, for the love of God.** As a male who spends irresponsibly of my own money, your $10k will disappear overnight, whereupon this over-stretched, immature, self-centered person will expect you to stretch yourself still more thinly for his convenience. \n\n**I know plenty of married people who maintain separate accounts and who have their own lives.** I personally consider this healthy. Usually there's a separate joint account. In the past, I've had live-in girlfriends who were more responsible with money than I was, and I simply gave them my half of the expenses, which they handled. This they were quite happy to do; mind, they weren't nearly as burdened with other obligations at the time as you are right now, and I wasn't so bad as to take cash destined for the landlord and spend it on the way. **Joint accounts are not appropriate for a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship.**",

            "I know a lot of people on here are giving you advice, like break up with him immediately, and it might not be bad advice but I would definitely take it with a grain of salt, since the people here don't really know your life or your history together. \n\nYou two have been together a while, and extreme stresses like you've described have been known to bring out the worst in people. What I would do, and I would sort of think of it as a \"test\" in a sense, is to be more assertive and take care of your own needs. Don't go out of your way for him anymore, and just do what you need to do and make yourself your number one priority. That isn't really the test, that is something you should  be doing already.\n\nThe test is, to see how he reacts to this. You already mentioned that he has called you selfish and such when you've tried to assert yourself previously. This is huge red flag. It kind of sounds like you've been a little \"too nice\" to him over the course of your relationship, and because of his stress he's probably not able to think as clearly so he's started taking you for granted. \n\nSo, what I would do, is to start asserting yourself, don't give him any money, and possibly distancing yourself from him, by just not really making a huge effort to see him like you have been. Make it clear that you still love him, you aren't trying to hurt anybody, you are only taking care of yourself and your own needs. It might even be a good idea to talk with him about your feelings and fears. (if you feel like this would be a bad idea, that is another huge red flag, since you should be able to talk about anything in a healthy relationship)\n\nI can see one of two more likely scenarios occurring...\n\nIf he loves you,  this should be a wake up call, and he realizes the way he has been acting, and be afraid of losing you.  He will realize that you have needs that are just as important as his. He will miss you and will start making a more equal effort to see you when he can. \n\nIf he is just using you, he will guilt trip you, call you selfish and use whatever other means he has of making you feel bad if you stop giving him the things he wants. You've mentioned that he's already been doing the above, as well as pressuring you to do things you (probably rightly) aren't comfortable with, like \"sharing\" your savings with him.  You have to remember, you do not owe him anything. For a relationship to be healthy, it has to be consensual, respectful and voluntary in every way. A partner should never demand anything in a relationship, and neither of you owe the other anything.\n\nIf you continue taking care of your own needs, and he continues disrespecting you, guilt tripping you, or even threatens to break up with you, this is a good sign that he is only using you. If he breaks up with you because of this, I know it would be very painful, but it would be good to think of it as if you have dodged a bullet, because that would be exactly what it was. If it's very clear that he's not going to change and he is offended at you taking care of yourself...well that seems pretty obvious that he does not care about you.\n\nAlso, someone else mentioned elsewhere in this thread, that it might be wise to look at the situation as an outsider. Imagine that someone you care about like a sister or a friend were in the same situation as you. What would you say to them? What advice would you give them. In the end you are the only one who can know what is best for you and your life. \n\nI apologize that this post is long. It just kind of struck a chord with me since I've been through very similar situations in the not so distant past. I have cut out many abusive people in my life,and it was not  easy. Sometimes it is still not, and at times I still ask myself if I made the right decisions, especially since I loved and cared about those people a lot. \n\nThen all I have to think about how shocking it was to see how little they actually seemed to care about me  when I started asserting myself in even just simple ways. Just telling someone I couldn't help them because I needed to get a full night of sleep for example, or getting guilt tripped telling someone I couldn't loan them money because I needed it (And they had a history of not paying me back). I was literally killing myself for other people at one point in my life, I didn't know how to say no, and one day I decided enough was enough and it wasn't worth living like that. It was very scary and painful at first, especially the first time I said \"no\" to someone about something small. The people who cared about me simply accepted my response and my boundaries with no hard feelings. Those who couldn't do that are no longer in my life.\n\nRelationships are never easy, and not black and white by any means, but there are some obvious red flags that should make you take a step back, and do some further investigating before moving forward with any sort of relationship.\n\nI hope everything goes well. Good luck.",

If you say no, he may walk away, and that is a risk you want to take, because you don't want to be with a person who just wants a doormat not a partner. \n\nThe boundaries he has crossed which you have let him cross:\n\n- Your studies come first. End of story. You are investing in your future. \n- Your savings are for your education, room and board. You two are not married, not engaged, and you aren't even living together.

A team is when both people are working toward each other's best interests. A team has each person bringing all they have to the table. In your team, you're the only one contributing. That's not actually a team. It's more like a parasite-host relationship.\n\nIt won't get better. It doesn't matter how lovely he is the rest of the time, or how long you've been with him.

            "> How do I convince my parents to leave me alone, and get them to understand that forgiveness isn't forthcoming for a very long time, maybe ever?\n\nI have an honest question OP, and while I understand there's a cultural barrier here, you've been living 3+ years in Europe, so I hope you'll be able to get where I'm coming from: why do you need to continue being so close with a \"family\" who don't give a **shit** about you needing to live in exile for likely the rest of your life? A family who will defend and coddle a thief who had not only broken the law, but **willingly** used your name in order to incriminate you. I won't insult you by asking whether you fully understand just how targeted you were, but I do need to ask you  whether you see that your family is being every bit as complicit as him by asking you to forgive him, for the sake of \"being a family again\", without having him take steps to clear your name.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is, you now have a completely different life ahead of you that what you envisioned. I'm assuming you're financially independent from your family or working on it. I understand you more than you know (I too fled to Europe from a different culture, from an unsustainable political situation in my country, without there seeming a possibility of ever going back, except I've already been here for some 15 years), so please don't dismiss this when I say that your life is not only not over, but can actually turn out to be fantastic, especially given how young you are. You had a fiancee who, while I understand was indeed under enormous social and familiar pressure, decided to leave you rather than take the leap and plan a life with you in Europe, which, while I understand it's a lot to ask of someone, in my mind it shouldn't be out of a fiancee, certainly one who was willing to live separated from you for 3 years. I'm sure she's a lovely person, but when push came to shove, just like your parents, she failed to see the bigger picture when a conflict arose between a hard situation and this mythical idea of \"family\".\n\nThis long-winded comment is to a) reassure you that you **absolutely** will to get a life that, while not what you envisioned when you were a child, with a bit of luck will surpass it in happiness and unexpected freedoms, even when you don't see it right now because to fully culturally acclimatise to a new country takes just a little more time than you've been here, and b) to help you see that dealing with your family is easier than you thought:\n\nWhat you do is (on the phone with your mother): \"hi mother, from now on I will ask you that you respect my decision not to speak to my brother who dishonoured me so criminally that my life can never be what I envisioned. If you cannot do that, I am afraid I will need to interpret that as you actually not caring about me, and I will act in consequence with that, meaning that I will no longer be speaking with you either. Talk it over with Father, and please let me know if your decision; dealing with the consequences of having to make a life for myself in this foreign country takes a lot of effort that I cannot afford to continue being in contact with \"family\" who I don't feel are at least empathetic to my situation, and the way I measure that is via actions\".\n\nAnd then follow through. I know this is almost unthinkable for a son to say to his family in Asia (especially SEA), but then again, I assume it was also unimaginable for you that a) your brother would willingly incriminate you, and b) that your family would fully stand behind him, am I wrong?\n\nHorrible as this might seem to you, it's time, and necessary, for you to start thinking about what's best only for yourself, given that your whole family had betrayed you. You're in a foreign country, and will need to make it your home now. This will take time, but you will get there, and in 10 years time I can promise you you will look back at this, and not fully comprehend how you were willing to put up with so much bullshit after having being hurt so badly by ask the very people who were supposed to love you unconditionally, and if you work hard (it seems being highly educated is something you've already got), you'll have a life that's comfortable, rich, and fulfilling, to an extent that you can't imagine today.\n\nBest of luck.",

            "I am quite familiar with these types of family culture, they also exist in other places than Asia (assuming OP is from there). If the family is strong and stable, having them in your life is a blessing. But sadly, the world has bad people everywhere, even in families. \n\nI have a good friend who had a bad family situation. It wasn't fraud, but her mother sold her out when she was a child. She had to endure years of abuse even from her own father. Her mother happily cashed in the money from other \"clients\" while her poor daughter was crying from pain. Her two brothers were not effected and got fancy toys from the money their little sister \"earned\"...\n\nLuckily, the girl managed to graduate high school and made it to college through a scholarship, which also allowed her to study abroad. Later she managed to find work, got married and built a decent life. However, the trauma from her childhood left traces. She suppressed all her pain and had a breakdown a few years ago. Therapy followed, thankfully she doing better now. Ever since she left her country however, she has been in very low contact with her family. Her siblings were also trying to pressure and guilt-trip her to forgive them, but she refused and eventually cut them all off completely. \n\nPoint is, culture is one thing, but, as the example above shows, it doesn't stand above the law and morality. Yes, family is important, but that requires that it also acts like one. \n\nNot sure if this will fully apply to OP, but many people who were raised by narcissistic parents have to face similar issues. I strongly recommend OP to check out r/raisedbynarcissists \n\nOn a final note, OP, ask yourself how you would react when your best friend did this to you? You would most likely not want to see this person again. Apply the same logic to your family. Other than that, make sure you build a new life, find a girl who loves you and perhaps start your own little family in the future. You deserve to be happy, free from toxic people.

He lived for three days and passed and it was the worst experience of my life. I was holding him when he died.\n\n\nMy wife is an absolute mess. We made the guest bedroom into the baby's room and she goes in there and screams. I'll go home and she'll be laying there with the things we bought him and bawling. She won't go anywhere, she barely eats or speaks to anyone but me. She does go to greif counseling, but it's not helping. I did go to a session with her once, she's mad at me because I was holding him when he died. While I understand her anger, it's misplaced. Because that was incredibly hard and I'm still having nightmares about it...\n\nWhen I suggested maybe we should donate the stuff she had a meltdown. I could go on and on about all the things she's been doing since the loss.\n\nTL;DR older parents, baby died of unexpected heart issues and wife is beside herself. Greif counseling not helping.\n\nEDIT:A few people have asked, and, she doesn't work. Never has. My son describes me as \"loaded\" got into the internet before it took off. \n\nAll I'm saying about her greif is she hasn't improved at all. She was this upset six months ago. I want her to grieve, and I'd never take that away from her, but I also want her to get better... I love her.",

            "Therapist here. \n\nThis is definitely complicated grief territory. It sounds like she needs a higher level of care. \n\nDo you feel able to talk to her about your concern for her? Maybe you could ask if you could come to a counseling session and talk about next steps with the professional. \n\nMany times insurance will require a referral from a counselor to progress to a higher level of care. They have day programs that range from spending all day at a mental health facility for weeks on end to half days or a handful of hours a few times a week. \n\n",
            "I had no idea how difficult this would be. She's heartbroken, and so am I. I knew the second he was going to die because he got really tense for a few minutes and was gone. It was such a weird experience. Ya know since he wasn't planned I didn't think it would hurt this bad, but it definitely has.",
            "Maybe this is a really dumb suggestion, but when my baby sister died at three weeks old, my parents packed up and left for the beach for a couple weeks. They just wanted to get away.  It wasn't a celebratory vacation by any means but it took away the constant reminders for a few days. It wasn't an elaborate get away, they just packed the car and went to a quiet beach town during the off season.  Certainly won't be the cure all for this, but something to think about. I think having another child (me) that they needed to care for also helped them keep it together. Maybe you two could go visit your kids at college more often? \nAlso, it's been 22 years since my sister died. My mom has had bad anxiety ever since and she's never gotten help. Honestly, when we got the family dog (who is mostly her dog) it really helped her a lot. I know now would not be the time, but maybe consider it a long time off from right now. \n\nThese are just simple suggestions that you could do in addition to therapy and maybe medication. I wanted to pass along what helped my parents because while they will never forget, I think they have healed the best they could for what happened.  ",
            "First, I think there needs to be recognition from both of you that this is going to take time. A lot of time, maybe years (although I would warn you not to accept the severity of this grieving for years, I am just stating the wound could be fresh for a long time). \n\nThe grief counseling might not work right away. But please, continue to encourage her to keep going. I would recommend counseling for you as well, to have a safe space to work out your loss, and to have a safe space to worry about your wife.\n\nFor right now, just be there for her. Allow her to grieve (as long as she poses no danger to herself). It doesn't seem like she is ready to move the baby's things, so I wouldn't suggest that again for a while. \n\nTake care of yourself, and be supportive. Cook her meals even though she is barely eating. Remind her she is loved, every day. Attempt to do little things to make her smile, even for a moment. \n\nThese types of wounds never truly heal, we just get strong enough to move through the pain. If you're here for her in her time of need, she is going to appreciate this immensely when she looks back on this time. \n\nPlease reach out to your children as well and make sure they are doing well. They lost a sibling, and from personal experience I know that watching your parents go through something like this is horrifying. Make sure that they have access to any help should they need it, and that they are doing okay in their lives. \n\nI wish you the very best. ",
            "You need a better (or more intensive) grief counselor. \nI'm so sorry, OP. This is one of the most devastating losses a human can experience. I can't imagine. \n",

            "My parents lost their son and my brother in a nearly identical situation. Normal pregnancy, no warning. Then he was born and he had a problem that no one had seen, he lived a few days and then was gone. \n\nIt's very hard. Even now, thirty years later, my mom still aches for the baby and visits him regularly in the cemetery. And my dad, well i don't think he does. It's very different. \nMy mom has told me about it, and she said that it hurt so much to lose him that she wanted to leave my dad despite their happy marriage. And it all came down to how my dad handled it, handled her, that saved them and their marriage in the end. And i'm sorry, but now you have a huge responsibility that has been handed to you. \n\nYou are going to have to let her grieve. To let her scream, to let her cry, weep, beg, plead, and fall asleep on his bedroom floor. And then you are going to have to pick her up and carry her to your room, and tuck her in. Kiss her forehead. Run her a bath. Give her time, space. Cook for her even when she won't eat it. Lay with her on his bedroom floor and just don't say a word other than I love you. Take her to his grave in a few months and leave flowers, sit for hours or never leave the car.\n\nIt's going to hurt and it's going to be hard. So hard. And i'm sorry you've got to take care of her while also grieving. But you've got this.\nGood luck. Really. ",
            "As a parent who has lost my 19 yr old daughter, I understand.  Losing a child at any age is the most devastating dehabilitating loss that you can ever imagine.  I will break down my experiences into sections for both your wife and your.\n-+Wife-this loss is like nothing she will ever have known.  She has lost a piece of her that she carried inside for months, that she has already lived for months, that she had planned a future with for years. I cannot say this enough... There is no timetable for this grief.  She is probably still in shock yet and will be for a while. Unfortunately, the sense of loss never truly goes away.  You don't get over this grief.. you just find better ways to deal with it. Give her time, lots of time.  There will eventually be days where she starts to talk to you. I can't stress this enough... JUST LISTEN! Don't talk, interrupt, let her vent her hurt.  Cry together. This may be the most important thing you can do. \n-+You-take the time to grieve.  I know from experience that father doesn't get near the support.  Friends will ask how she is doing and never ask about you.  Society says the man should be strong, take care of the wife and family.  I cannot stress this enough... give yourself time to grieve.  You don't have to be strong.. let your wife and family see you cry. \nFor both of you-this has fundamentally changed you.  Discovering how takes time.. years tbh.  Make sure and turn to each other for support, as well as from friends/family. If there were any serious issues in the marriage beforehand this will just magnify them for quite a while. If you want to talk, pm me. Good luck and again, I am so sorry for your loss. ",
            "Wow, first of all, thanks all for the support second I think some of you misunderstood I lightly suggested we donate his crib once. She freaked out and I haven't said anything since. I just think going In there is hurting her even more.\n\nI did go to a session with her once, she's mad at me because I was holding him when he died. While I understand her anger, it's misplaced. Because that was incredibly hard and I'm still having nightmares about it...",
            "Losing a child is never easy. Considering that your wife is older, she likely felt that this pregnancy was special, which could explain why she's taking it so hard. \n\nGet yourself into counselling as well. Be it together, by yourself, or both. You can let out your own feelings on the situation and learn how to better comfort your wife. See if you can find some groups for women who have lost a child and suggest she join. She probably feels extremely alone in her grief right now and it would be good for her to get that reassurance. \n\nDon't talk about doing anything with the baby's things until she is ready. She will decide on her own time, and you suggesting to get rid of it may solidify her feelings of loneliness. Hug her lots. Let her know that she is loved. Make her food, clean the house, encourage her in her healing process. Maybe even take her away for a weekend when you feel like she's starting to make progress. \n\nHow are your other children? Are they close to your wife and active in her life?",
            "This made my eyes well up...I'm so sorry for you both. I couldn't even imagine...",
            "I'm so sorry for your loss.\n\nI agree with other posters that your wife needs a different counselor and/or more intensive therapy.  Also, there's a /r/babyloss/ subreddit that may be helpful.\n\n",
            "It may be good to look into grief counseling for both yourself and your wife, because I can't imagine how devastating something like this might be. Even if you don't really feel like you have to process like your wife does, getting some counseling could set an example (or at the very least you could get some tools to use to help support your wife).",
            "Not only is this devastating, she carried a baby full term and that alone messes with hormones for months afterwards. It's not as simple as \"we had a baby and then we didn't\", it's \"we had this miracle baby that was taken away too soon, and oh yeah there is probably some severe postpartum depression ON TOP of all of that\". Please continue to do all of the right things, like therapy and being supportive. She is grieving, but also likely feels some sort of \"guilt\" for \"dragging you through this\" (that phrase is what I tell my husband when my life feels out of control). I encourage you to meet with a doctor in addition to a counselor to help regulate hormone levels and brain chemicals. When she's ready to donate your child's things, she will tell you. It seems like you know better than to push her, so let her take the lead. Thank you for being a good life partner for her.\n\nSo sorry about your loss. Please allow yourself time to grieve as well.",
            "You had a child die. That stuff changes a person, sometimes forever. She's still the woman that you love, but she's heartbroken and is going to need support and love for a long time.\n\nEven going through a miscarriage can be really difficult. This is much much harder. Stop thinking about this in terms of when she will get \"back to normal\" and start thinking about it in terms of mourning a lost child that will always not be there. This birthday is going to hurt every year.\n\nThere's a hole in her heart. It's not smaller than it used to be, but it grew to love another child and now there's always going to be something missing.",
            "This is truly tragic and I'm so sorry for what you and your family are going through.  In addition to such a devastating loss, your wife is also likely battling with her hormones returning to normal after pregnancy, and that never helps anything. Perhaps that's something she and her doctor can address, even if it helps just the tiniest bit. \n\nHave you guys thought of having a memorial ceremony for your baby? Something like writing all your feelings and lost wishes on pieces of paper, and tying them to balloons  to float away may help.  It might serve as a concrete way to say goodbye to your lost son so she can begin healing, which may take a very long time.\n\nMy heart goes out to your family. No one deserves this, and you guys just happened to be dealt the shittiest cards. ",
            "When a woman is pregnant her body is rippling with crazy body chemistry and horomones. Her body was preparing her for a baby. It wanted her to love and protect the child. Her body has become the problem. Even women with perfectly healthy happy babies get post partum. She is depressed and suffering physically. She needs to be medicated and to seek a doctor who specialized in post partum. This is unique in that she had two issues. Her body has turned on her and she suffered a horrible lose. \n\nTwo things. You got grief counseling, great. But until her chemistry is fixed it will be in vain. She needs medical help.\n\nI've also been in a helpless state of body chemistry. Once I found the right thing I broke down in happy tears. I was free of my body's cycle of suffering.\n\nGood luck and it might be a while but without medication, the right one, it will get worse and change her for the long haul in very negative ways. My sister in law never came back from post partum because she refused the medications even though she said they helped. After a month of improvement she said she didn't want to take them because she didnt feel crazy so wasn't going to take \"crazy people pills\". She's been a shell of her former self since. 7 years now.",
            "Oh man I am so sorry. It is horrible, it is like all the future of the baby is taken away from you. First steps, first smiles, first days in school, all that things you enjoy when you grow a child are taken away. Huge loss. \n\nMaybe you should change the counsellor and find another. And another for yourself. I mean, your wife needs more help, she is clearly mentally falling apart... And currently is not equipped to cope with the loss. ",
            "Ok-first I am so sorry for your loss-made all the worse (if possible) that it came as a complete shock.\n\nYour wife's grief is probably fairly normal. As a mom I can understand where she is coming form. Although it may be sexist to say I believe women grieve more visibly and vocally than men.\n\nI would stop mentioning donating anything. I would hold her while she cries and cry with her. I would sign both of you up with a grief therapist. I would try to get your adult kids to spend some time with her.\n\nIm so sorry.",
            "My cousin lost her baby last summer and she still can't part with his belongings. I would hold off on suggestion to donate things for awhile. I'm really really sorry I wish I could do more to help you all :( ",
            "Are you going to grief counseling OP?? It's important you both go and it's possible attending some sessions together could help. \n\nThere's a tone to some of these comments that you're being unreasonable in your expectations  but what I'm getting is not that you expect her to be \"fine\" but that you've seen zero difference. That's scary and concerning for sure. There is no timeline for grief but if it is just as raw then yes it's time for more help. \n\nI'm so deeply sorry for your loss. You have both lived a nightmare. \n\nContinue to be there for her. Go to counselling together. Don't \"push\" but do make it known you want to be ok together. That moving past the initial shock and heartbreak and fury DOESNT mean you want to forget. ",
            "I am so sorry for your loss. While I have not personally experienced the loss of a child, several young people in my family have passed. So, I have unfortunately seen the grief process up close. It's great she's going to therapy. Likely it is helping, but it's not going to be instantaneous. It takes time. A lot of time. It was probably 5 years before my mom could be considered emotionally healthy after my brother died. Year 1 and 2 were absolute hell. So, please remember to be patient. Time really does help. \n\nMy family has also been involved with the organization Compassionate Friends, which was very helpful. ",
            "Not sure where you are located OP, but in Australia there are some great over the phone services from groups such as Sands and MotherSafe. All the counsellors are women who have had miscarriages themselves and know what your wife is going through. Dont forget to look after yourself too, they also have male counsellors who have all had a SO lose a baby too.  \n  \n  \nMy wife was not big on talking to anyone other than myself but she found comfort in talking to these women because she didn't know them in real life.  ",
            "Planned or not, he was your son, and you loved him. The loss is no less real, no less painful because he wasn't planned. It's natural for you both to be hurting...I'd be more worried if you weren't. \n\nIt's absolutely horrible to lose a child. It's unnatural, and not something you expect to have to survive, so when it happens, it's often much harder to work through than the loss of a sibling or a friend. It's going to take time. A lot of it. And part of you will never fully get over it. And that's okay. You learn to cope, learn to function, and eventually you learn to experience joy again...but not yet. \n\nIt's very possible your wife needs more intensive help working through her pain that grief counseling can offer her. Remember that he's been gone for less time than she carried him in her body, for less time than you loved and anticipated him. Time is standing still right now, and that's okay. It hasn't been that long. \n\nBe affectionate. Be patient, with yourself as well as with her. Tell her that you love her, and need her. Talk to her about your own pain. And see a therapist yourself. Not just to help you to better help her, but for your own grief as well. I know it might feel unfair, how the depth of her grief seems all consuming, but you have to remember she knew him every second of those nine months. I'm not diminishing your own loss, not at all. I don't want you to ignore it because you're focused on helping her heal. That could prove devastating in the long run. \n\nI'm terribly sorry for your loss. For your entire family. Be a rock for her, but don't neglect yourself in the process. ",
            "I'm sorry for your loss. I lost our first son when I was 5 months pregnant; I learned about grief in a very different way that I had ever experienced before. ~ Talk about your son, acknowledge his existence, let her guide the conversations. Do *not* tell her to \"get over it\", or try to brush off what happened. Let her know that you are there for her to take her anger (and yes, I understand her anger about you holding him when he passed - it's a mom/hormonal thing). Did the hospital take foot/hand prints? Get copies of them framed and ask her if she would like to hang them somewhere. If someone asks how many children you have, your answer better be \"3\". I strongly suggest a couple of books: \"When Bad Things Happen to Good People\" by Harold S. Kushner and also \"Empty Arms\" by Sherokee Ilse. What I tell people who are grieving someone this close to them is that it's like a hole has been ripped from your heart, that hole never closes, but the jagged edges do smooth out over time and the gaping hole won't be as large as it once was. One year of grief for the passing of a close family member is a guideline, but for a mother losing her child I will say it's closer to two years. One more thing... never, ever say to her that \"it was god's will\" - that only increases the grief and wonder what she did that was so bad that god decided to punish her.",
            "My husband and I are older parents. We had three miscarriages and then a period of two and a half years where nothing happened. By the last miscarriage we didn't even discuss it much. We had lost all hope that I would even carry the child. So I thought I was going through the change. I wasn't feeling well and was snapping at my husband which is so unlike me. When I went to the doctor testing revealed I was actually 10 weeks pregnant. I said to my best friend who congratulated me that she shouldn't. The baby would die anyways, I would miscarry like all the others. We waited. We made it to three months, none of the other pregnancies did. But still we were scared and worried. What if we lost the others because something was wrong? As awful as this sounds, even though we had testing and were told nothing was wrong with the baby, we still wouldn't let ourselves hope. We only bought things a week before the baby came. I set up his room two days before I went in the hospital. They do these questionnaires about how you are feeling. I was red flagged for postpartum depression before he was even born. He was born and fine, just had an extra thumb which they did surgery on. It was only then that we finally accepted that it was going to be alright. We actually had a baby. The Health Nurses expected to see a very sad mother. I explained that because of what we had gone through our anxiety was extreme. \n\nOur outcome was beautiful. Yours was not. I am so sorry for that. I would suspect she was terrified through the whole pregnancy that something would be wrong with him. That she had a drink before she knew she was pregnant, could she have harmed the baby? That she was crazy to risk pregnancy at this age. Did she have enough folic acid in her early pregnancy? Would she have the energy to take care of a baby? Believe me an older pregnant mother has far more fears than she will even admit to her husband. All these things contribute to guilt that she now feels. I wish I could explain to you the blame mothers put on themselves when something goes wrong, even when none of it is anything she did. She is the one that carried him so she thinks it is her fault. The loss of a child is the most grievous loss of all. I know two women who have lost children, one is over 5 years ago and the pain of it is still felt daily for her. Her husband too but at times they are at different places in their grief. Sometimes he wants to be done with it, try to move on. This makes her so angry. I take from it that grief is individual. \n\nI am glad she is in therapy. I hope she visits a doctor too. It would be important because of her age that she has her hormone levels tested. It takes quite a while for the postpartum body to get back to normal. No words I can say will help. I am sorry. I imagined myself in your spot but it is impossible to conjure how you must feel. This is terribly empty for you both. To go home without a baby and a room all ready. \n\nI guess if I have advice, don't talk about donating anything from the room. Better to leave things as they are. She is not ready, doing that would mean she accepts he is gone. She doesn't yet. Acceptance can take a long time. Maybe these things would be saved for your future grandchildren and you both can feel like a bit of him can still be close. Be open and talk about him if she is comfortable to. Do not forget yourself in this. You may think that it isn't the same for you because you didn't carry him. You are a father that has lost a child. It may hit you like a ton of bricks soon. I feel the way you write this that for you the whole thing is surreal and you haven't quite processed how you feel about it. Plus you are worried about your wife because of her outward grief when you may have a more inward type of grief. Take care of yourself too. Again I am sorry. ",
            "I've been thinking about getting her a puppy. Just something to take care of... Maybe to help a little...",
            "In addition to grief she may also be struggling with postpartum depression which is a separate hormonal/chemical issue (I'm in no way trying to minimize the intensity of the grief/feelings, but postpartum depression alone without a traumatic event can be extremely difficult to get a handle on and isn't often identified). ",
            "i don't think there's anything you can really *do*, here.  she'll have to process this, and it will take a lot of time.  depending upon how long ago this happened [edit:  i see six months ago; that's not a lot of time, it's still less than the length of time she carried and nurtured her unborn child], i wouldn't rule out grief counseling as unhelpful just yet, as these things take a LOT of time to deal with.  if she's not also/already seeing a general psychologist, that might not be a bad idea - because one of the things i'm guessing she's dealing with, in addition to the heartrending loss of an infant, is feeling like this was her last chance.  which would be compounded by having adult children and possibly even before the pregnancy, whether or not she verbalized or even necessarily *felt* it, going through the whole empty nest thing.  \n\nthere's a lot to unpack here, and she needs, in my opinion, not only targeted grief counseling, but also general counseling to deal with the two complicating factors mentioned above.  in fact, those two complicating factors may be precisely *why* simple grief counseling doesn't seem to be \"working\".  losing a baby is always awful, but it's different (not worse, but different) to lose one when on the cusp of menopause with adult children than it is to lose one at 25.  she's being smacked in the face with her own mortality, in *addition* to this terrible loss.\n\nas for what you can do, i think it boils down to being patient, supportive, and encouraging her to seek outside help.  one thing that might be helpful, though, as a specific action on your part and assuming you guys haven't already discussed it, is to gently ask her if she's also sad to think this might have been her last chance.  it might spark off a lightbulb over her head, open a healing conversation, and allow her to start processing this on multiple levels, rather than just the obvious one.  (it could also cause damage, though - it might be too much for her to deal with unless she's already been at least privately thinking about it - so i give that suggestion cautiously; it is probably better left to a professional.  but if she's made noises like that before, it couldn't hurt for you to explore it with her.)  \n\ni'm very sorry for your family's loss.",

My wife was in the hospital with severe pre-eclampsia so she didn't really get to see our daughter at all. \n\nShe had a ton of grief and anger. She would go on the baby room and cry and was bombarded with reminders of what she didn't have.   It's amazing how much drama there is on TV with pregnant women and them almost losing their babies. \n\nI had boxed up a bunch of our daughter's clothes and such so it wouldn't be as much of a reminder, and like you my wife wasn't happy about that. \n\nShe went to counseling for a while, nearly a year to a year and a half, and I went a few times but did not find it helpful at all.   \n\nAt least she understood that we each were grieving in our own way.  \n\nThe worst part about all this is that unless someone has gone through it they don't understand.

You need to be her rock, and hopefully she can be yours.   But talk to her.   Let her know how you're feeling as well and ask her what she needs and tell her what you need. \n\nYou'll either come out stronger together or this will drive a wedge between the two of you. Hopefully, you'll make it through together.  Don't take things personally, realize it's the grief talking. \n\nThe pain is never going to go away, but will eventually get a little easier to manage.   You both won't be having breakdowns multiple times a day.  \n\nEventually you can find a way to honor your child.   We bought and donated a bunch of toys at Christmas to the local children's hospital to honor our daughter. \n\n",
            "Well, you didn't specify how long it has been since the loss so I'm going to assume it hasn't been a ridiculous amount of time. And you didn't specify what you have done to help her so I am going to assume nothing, not because I think you're an asshole but because I don't want to leave anything out.\n\nThe first thing I would suggest is to stop having her see a grief counselor and see a real psychologist. Perhaps even a therapist AND a psychiatrist. \n\nThe second thing you need to do is make sure she knows that you're there for her. Let her know she can talk to you about this. You also need to let her grieve in her own way. \n\nThe third thing I would do (for your own sanity) is to remind her you lost your child too. Not in a rude or harsh way but when she gets angry with you because he was in your arms when he died that's absolutely ridiculous. And flat out not okay. I get being angry because he passed but it is in NO way your fault. It'd be like you blaming her because her body grew a baby with a birth defect. \n\nI am so sorry for your loss. You guys will get past this, though. Be there for her and remember to take care of yourself as well. My thoughts are with you guys.\n\nEdit: I saw while reading the comments that it has been six months. While grief has no time limit I would highly suggest asking for a referral to see a therapist and psychiatrist. At this point, you should be seeing at least some tiny bits of improvement.",
            "First, sincerest condolences on the loss of your son. I couldn't begin to imagine...\n\nI've seen a lot of comments about getting a \"better\" grief counselor. Right now this isn't about the counselor's ability as a clinician; in time, sure it absolutely may be. You 2 are only 6 months out from his loss. This is a sucker punch that will continue to hurt for the rest of your lives. You both were given a grand surprise of a later in life pregnancy, with new hopes and dreams to begin all over again. Your family was robbed of all of that and it isn't fair. That's okay to say it isn't fair. It's okay if your wife needs to go in his room and scream and cry and lay there. It's \"normal\" in grief that she is angry that she wasn't holding him on his last breath; even though I imagine how painful it is for you that she is angry with you over that. It's not a rational anger at you though; it's traumatic grief. If you need to cry, scream, be angry, do it. No not at each other (in case ppl interpret this as doing it to each other), at the loss. You both need to mourn in whatever way you need to mourn.\n\nObviously there will be things to monitor- rapid weight loss, significant impact in social functioning (w/ work, family,friends), hallucinations/delusions (grief can do that), any expressed thoughts of self harm or killing herself, eating, sleeping, hygiene, so yes do get her into immediate care for an evaluation if you think she has gotten to the point where things are out of control. With a thorough assessment they can get a proper intervention in place for your wife. There's no timetable for how anyone is supposed to act after a month, 6 months, or within a year of such a trauma. Again, I'm very sorry your family was met with such tragedy and I do wish you all well and that you all continue to take care of each other. ",
            "You need to understand that her bond with your baby was incredibly close and intense. She carried him inside her for 9 months and thought of herself as his mother that whole time. She felt him kick, dealt with all the hormones, and went through labor to bring him into this world. For all that time he was an abstract concept to you but extremely real and concrete for your wife. She has every right to be distraught and it will be a long time before she is even close to healed. Losing a baby is something life-altering that I doubt any woman fully heals from. Hell, I miscarried at 5 1/2 weeks and I can still easily summon tears about it nearly 4 years later. I've never been the same. \n\nDon't rush your wife. \n\nTalk about your baby with other people, no matter how uncomfortable it makes them. It's important for people to say his name and for her to know he was loved by people besides her. \n\nEncourage her to build a memory box with photos, footprints, clothes he wore, blankets, their hospital bracelets. Pack that all in a trunk and keep it. She doesn't have to look at it now if it's too painful but she will regret not having it later. \n\nDo NOT! DO NOT! Dismantle the nursery before she's ready. She may always have difficulty entering that room. \n\nShe has been through an incredibly traumatic and heartbreaking experience. She needs to grieve at her own pace. If possible find a counselor that specializes in baby loss instead of just a general grief counselor. \n\nThe only thing that will really make a difference is time. And even then there will still be a hole in her heat where your baby belongs. She will live her whole life wondering about the alternate time line where he lived. She will mark every birthday and death date for the rest of her life. Those days will be especially hard for her. I encourage you to have her take those days off and do something special in remembrance of him like lighting candles or visiting his grave. \n\nI'm so sorry this happened to you both. It's not fair. It's horrible. It is a pain I would not wish on my worst enemy. ",

            "I am deeply sorry for your loss.\n It is hard for me to relate to this situation, the grief must be so profound I can't even imagine how it must feel. \nThis situation, from psychology reports and people that I know that also lost a baby child (my grand parents), have often two consequences:\n\n1. A couple  can manage over time to stay together. One partner is able to stay strong to help the other one in need of comfort. \n\nor\n\n2.A couple can fall apart as each partner have a hard time to cope with their own grief. They get distant from one another. \nOften their is an effect of projection of the grief over the other partner, the other partner is a reminder of the incident. Some couples can't survive this. \n\nMy only sound advice is to speak to a real accredited shrink, not a counselor. He will lead her through the five stages of grief (Kubler-Ross model): denial, anger, bargain, depression, acceptance. (read about it) \n\nFrom what you wrote your wife must be in the bargain stage, in between anger and depression. \n\nI am positive you are going to get through this as a couple. Stay strong and take care of your family. ",

            "Nothing much to add here, just my sympathy. What an awful situation. I also suffered the loss of a child through medical issues, and then a subsequent miscarriage. This was after infertility, too. I couldn't believe that life could be so cruel. Your wife is understandably devasted- she needs time and your patience. I suffered from severe depression after my losses, but with time, medication, and counselling, I'm doing better. Your wife needs help, too. Maybe medication could help her, too.\nAgain, so sorry for your loss.",

Take her out to a movie, maybe something funny. Netflix and chill out and give her lots of love and affection. Maybe draw her a bath once in a while or send her flowers to brighten her day. I'm so sorry for your loss. ",

            "I'm so so sorry for your loss. Like many others have said, grief has no timeline. My second mother passed away a year ago and I still have horrible, ugly crying sessions pretty frequently. Losing a child, though, is a grief that I would never wish even on my worst enemy. Don't neglect yourself and the grief you are also feeling. Sending warm fuzzies your way and I hope you both find some sort of relief in the future as soon as time will allow. ",

            "I didn't read all the comments and I haven't lost a baby but has grief counseling talked about doing something to honor your son? I assume he has a headstone but maybe working on a fundraiser to donate money to research treatment for what he passed from, or a park bench dedicated to him... I think most of all addressing the guilt and anger she's harboring, in a safe environment, is best. Not all therapist are made equal. Maybe it's time for a switch up? Anyways are you able to talk to her at all? Or have your daughter talk to her...",
            "I am very sorry for your loss.  I just wanted to say that,  along side the grief counseling,  you may want to consider therapy, particularly something like EMDR, which is specifically used for treating people who have experienced traumatic events. It was the only thing that helped with my troubles,  and my mother had it as well after she watched her father die. It is very difficult therapy,  but has brought us peace.  I wish you both the best.

Trauma therapy is for events like this.  These therapists have special techniques to help you heal so you can start to grieve. \n\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.",

She must have cherished the thought..the baby and to lose it all must have been devastating ... i cant even imagine.   \n\nthe part of being angry at you for the baby dying in your hands is yes misplaced...she is irrationally angry that you got to experience it and not her....among the many many other things now denied to her.   \n\nplease show more patience...there is no timetable for grief. you have to let it run its course. hang in there and seek self care to ensyre you get through this.",

            "My niece was stillborn three months ago, and I hurt for the indescribable pain you are feeling. \n\nWhat you describe your wife experiencing are normal symptoms of grief. They are severe of course, but so was your loss. Everyone processes it differently, so although yours is just as great, you are not dealing with it in the same way, and that's OK. \n\nI think the suggestion of grief therapy is good; I'm in a support group that has been a great help. But a big part of what they say is it takes time, steps can't be rushed, and people feel different stages at different times. \n\nYou mentioned the nursery and your suggestion to move things out with her severe reaction- that comes up a lot in our group as something many people feel very strongly about and on different timelines, so you just bumped into a raw edge boundary if sounds like. \n\nAgain, I'm so sorry for your loss. I encourage you both to seek help in whatever form is meaningful for you. And give each other room to grief as individuals, but don't lose each other in the fog of grief. ",
            "In addition to everything that has already been said epecially about getting a higher level of mental health care ... If your son and daughter are in college they are presumably still somewhat dependent on the two of you. Is there some way your wife can immerse herself in something to do with them? Presuming it's something they would want. It would give her something to do to keep busy, and it would help remind her that - even though she won't be able to raise this child - she is still a mother and she still has children who are who they are because she raised them.

            "Hi OP, I am deeply sorry for your loss.\n\nWhen I was a kid my parents lost my 2 month old brother. He also died unexpectedly, in his case in his sleep.\n\n6 months is really not a long time at all for this type of grief. While I hear what posters are saying about complicated grief, I'd be careful not to frame your wife's grief as abnormal in any way. It's not. \n\nYou and your wife both need support beyond one another right now. One of the things my parents learned was that men and women can tend to grieve in different ways. They were both devastated. But my dad sought refuge in returning to routine,  going back to work, and holding it together for us. He couldn't understand why my mom acted very much like your wife,retreating into her grief and doing little else.  When she wasnt in bed she spent a lot of time stabbing the ground in the yard with a fork. She couldn't understand how anything could be allowed to live, and she couldn't understand how my dad could seem so uncaring as to just act like everything was normal. But in reality, they were both grieving in their own ways.  So you both need to know that,and know that unfortunately this takes a long time to process,and it hurts like hell.  And you both need support outside of one another. One of the best supports for my parents was connecting with other parents who had also lost babies. Only they could understand, and wouldn't tell my parents just to get over it already.\n\nI also want you to know that my parents did go on to lead meaningful lives after the loss of my brother.  It never just went away of course, and my mom usually needed to go to bed for a week around the anniversary.  But eventually life did begin to have color and purpose again,which seemed unimaginable to them during the worst of their grief.\n\nYour son was lucky to have caring parents like you.  It's terrifying to realize that we can't control something like that, but while he was here, you showed him love and tenderness. I wish you the very best. ",
            "> She does go to greif counseling, but it's not helping\n\nYou need to escalate your wife's care and move from grief counseling to something more specific, individualized and long-term. I would recommend she see a psychiatrist at this point. \n\n6 months and she's not eating or coping. Your wife is in a full-blown clinical depression and the lack of food, sleep and self-care is very critical at this point. \n\nWhat I want you to do is book an appointment with your GP. I want you to specifically discuss with your GP what is going on. And I want you to get them to give you the available services in the area (24-hour emergency health services for mental health, etc) and a speak about an action plan. \n\nYou need to go to your wife and in the most non-accusatory, supportive way, tell her you are worried about her. Tell her that you are concerned for her health and you two need to take some steps together. \n\nI think at this stage, your wife is going to need to see a medical doctor (psychiatrist) and a clinical psychologist, in tandem, to provide a rull-range of mental health services. I think you also need to really look at what services are around and find a team who are specialized in dealing with the loss of a child. \n\nThis is serious and I don't think getting away together or talk therapy with a grief counselor is right -- any qualified counselor would have seen some very specific symptoms that you're describing that are very troubling. Eating is kicking my alarm bells into overdrive. \n\nPlease, make that appointment ASAP. ",
            "My heart and prayers go out to you. I also lost a child recently and it has been the most difficult, surreal experience that no one else can understand. I also lost my significant other in a cruel breakup that happened the next day. No matter what the circumstances are of this kind of grief, there eventually comes an unexplained peace. Not in any specific timing, but time makes peace possible. The only way I could get through it however was through grief counseling. I hope you get the opportunity to participate in that. If you have the sense that your counselor is shit, don't be afraid to find a better one. I am with you. You are not alone. Believe me, you will be OK. And you will always have this child in your lives, in your thoughts and on your shoulder like an angel forever.",
            "What's interesting is my parents had a son after me, and he was perfectly normal. All the ultrasounds. My parents made them check, triple check, etc. He's 14, so technology is much newer, and the research on the defect has come so far they now are always able to detect it. After the fifth doctor SWORE the baby would not have the defect, they finally agreed to reuse the first boy's name, and pass it on to the new baby. \nThe very next doctors appointment\u2013they found out the baby suddenly had the same defect as the son before. The doctors said it was one of the most bizarre things they had ever seen, like the baby's heart had warped over night. \nMy brother now looks exactly like the baby lost, and has the same heart defect, and shares the same name. Everyone used to call the baby that died by a pet name, and my brother, even strangers, will always address him by the same pet name. It's very odd. \nThe baby died on date x/y. I have two brothers. Both of their birthdays are date x. Me and my sister have the same birthday. Date y. \nIt's very very strange.\nI think my mom believes the baby was reborn through my brother, but my younger brother, we've agreed i think never to tell him that he bears the name of the baby they lost.\n\nI hope she works through this and their marriage is saved. :( He seems sweet.",
