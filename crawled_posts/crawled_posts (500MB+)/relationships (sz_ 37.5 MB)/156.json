I loved the crafty aspect of wedding planning, and the idea of celebrating with family and friends, but my self esteem is very, very bad and I was convinced that I would look terrible and embarrass myself and my fianc\u00e9 with my appearance.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to report that I'm no longer engaged...because I went through with the wedding and got married this past weekend! It was easily the happiest day of my life and I have no regrets about having the wedding. My husband (!) was really supportive through the planning process and was very reassuring and helped me calm down when needed. \n\nI did hit a few snags (I DIY'd everything from the table runners, to the centrepieces to the flowers and although I pulled it off, omg was it ever stressful), but once the day got underway, I relaxed and had an amazing time.\n\nThis may go kind of against the typical r/relationships advice, but the best thing that I did was to just suck it up, and make myself do it. Basically I used the 'fake it till you make it' approach. I got an amazing dress, and got ready and had my hair and makeup done with my bridesmaids the day of. I was nervous but having them there with me (and a few glasses of champagne) really helped calm my nerves.\n\nOnce I started down the aisle and saw my husband, nothing else mattered. He thought I looked amazing and I felt amazing and it was a perfect day with our family and friends. Did I look perfect? No. Did it matter? No. I had a blast, and if I hadn't gone through with the wedding, I would have always regretted it. I know that weddings aren't for everyone, and that's ok, but I knew deep down that it was what I wanted. I'm so, so happy that I didn't let my insecurities prevent me from having an amazing day and marrying the love of my life with those I love present.\n\nTL;DR: I swallowed my insecurities, went through with the wedding, had the best day of my life, and married my best friend :)\n\n",

            "Hey, I remember your post! Congratulations, I'm happy for you that you overcame your doubts and enjoyed yourself, because I personally think \"perfection\" at weddings is way overrated, it's a time to celebrate and have fun. And you know, nothing makes a person look better than happyness!",
            "Okay, I lurked you and found your post with the picture of you from your wedding. You are sooo beautiful! All your worries about looking like a giant monster are completely in your head. You are so feminine, you have lovely curves and luscious hair and an adorable smile. You sound like a catch to me! I am saying this as a hetero women not someone being creepy. I genuinely think you are gorgeous. Im telling you this because I too have struggled with depression, anxiety and feeling ugly and self worthless. You're not alone and by far are not any of the things you called yourself. I'm so happy you were able to push through and enjoy your day. You rock! ",
            "Congratulations to you and your new husband. Wishing you both joy in your new life together.  \n  \nWell done on overcoming your fears. I felt similar leading up to my own wedding but as you said, once you see your husband to be, nothing else matters. :)",

            "Congratulations! Wonderful news that you went ahead and got married, and also that you were able to stay on top of your insecurities in the end.\n\nIf you haven't already, you should still consider finding a therapist. Insecurity can raise its head from time to time and it will still help to talk it through with a professional. It will also help to talk through your victory with them in order to investigate and reinforce whatever handling mechanism was working for you.\n\nBut right now, enjoy being married and being loved by the man of your dreams! Glad to hear things have gone so well for you! :)",

            "That's great to hear. We did a very DIY wedding ourselves, so I totally know how crazy things get (I didn't even get time to shave before the ceremony), but damn is the payoff worth it.  \nI found that after all the madness of the wedding was over, I had a bit of a comedown, so maybe plan some things for both of you to do together in the coming months.",
            "I can't tell you how happy I am to read this update - your first post really resonated with me and made me feel so sad, not least because I've had similar thoughts (to varying degrees) about myself - but it was such a shame to see someone else wrestling with that negativity. Your 'no longer engaged' made me catch my breath (damn you!) but I was delighted to read the rest of your post. Thank you for updating, and I'm ever so pleased for you!",
            "Wow, I teared up just a little bit reading this update. I'm so proud of you, OP! It's so easy for people with anxiety to sabotage their own happiness, but you exhibited great personal strength and didn't let that happen.",
            "What a wonderful update! Also, I peeked at your submissions and you are beautiful! Gorgeous dress too!!!",
            "Congrats OP!! All the best to you and your hubby! \n\nIt's amazing what the right outfit, makeup and hair do for one's confidence. Stick with the makeup thing. It's a lot of fun if you like DIY stuff. ",

Your husband sounds pretty cool too.\n\n\nIn terms of your insecurities and bad self-image, I don't know how you feel about that now and what steps you've taken or are taking to get better on that front, but hopefully remembering how well this day went will help you face your fears in the future. It's pretty good evidence that your appearance and how you feel about your appearance aren't inevitable laws of the universe, but are very context-driven and other people don't necessarily see you as negatively as you see yourself.\n\n\nEnjoy married life !",

Basically I used the 'fake it till you make it' approach. \n\nJust wanted to say that I have to admit, this usually helps me when I'm dealing with my own depression anxiety. Sometimes it's literally the best thing I can do to get through it because when I just suck it up and force myself through something, I end up having a great time that I would've *hated* to miss out on! (obviously the context of what I'm \"faking it\" through is quite relevant but if it's all down to me just being worried about feeling uncomfortable/self-conscious/etc., I usually just suck it up and tell myself that it's all in my head!...and it usually is! hah) \n\n> (and a few glasses of champagne)\n\nBubbles can usually get you through anything I find! haha\n\nCongrats on your marriage!

If the answer is no, then I stop. And try to find something nice to say to myself.\n\nBottom line is you are creating these insecurities when the truth is, I'm sure everyone at the event loves you for you and that is really all that matters.

            "Wonderful! Congratulations! \n\nI had a therapist when I was 16 who taught me \"fake it 'til you make it\". It's a lifesaver.",

I'm happy to see that you did! \n\nAnd I honestly don't know what you're talking about when you say you're \"not an attractive person.\" You looked beautiful in that photo!\n\nYou are a beautiful person and you were a beautiful bride.

        "selftext": "Thanks up front Reddit users for reading my long-winded background.\n\nI've always been kind of the goat with my family, and by that I don't mean \"greatest of all time.\" I mean my family always kind of looked down on me and held me to unreasonable expectations. I think it's because other than my dad, I was the only male in the house. I didn't get any special consideration for being the youngest (not that I'd want any), and anyway that was rendered irrelevant once my youngest sister was born. She was sort of the golden child throughout our childhoods, but my oldest sister also had special pride of place for being the oldest kid. I was the middle kid and even though I'm male I got hand-me-downs from my sister as long as the clothes weren't too effemimate. As an adult I can see how that's practical and moneysaving, but as a child it was embarrassing and also hurtful to see your sisters constantly get new clothes and new bikes, while I had to wear girls' clothes and ride hand-me-down girl bikes. Interestingly my younger sister never had to wear hand-me-downs from my older sister.\n\nMy mom and sisters pretty much had an easy life while my dad was alive because they just rode him all day long and henpecked him until he died fifteen years ago from a heart attack. He was only 58. Growing up sometimes my dad tried to do special guy things with me but my mom shamed him into stopping it.\n\nI just don't get it, why my mom was always so cynical and negative toward me. My hair was always too long or ugly, I was too skinny, then when I started working out in high school suddenly I was too muscular, then I was too tanned, then too pale, my grades weren't good enough, then once I got into a good school for college, it wasn't \"that good.\" When I earned my degree in business, I was a \"wannabe businessman fast food employee,\" when I got into graduate school for an MBA, it was a \"stupid idea,\" (not like I asked anyone to help me pay for it), etc. Why do you dress like that? You look dumb. Why don't you own a house? Your car is old. No one will respect you.\n\nYou know how that goes.\n\nI worked and earned my own pocket money starting at age fifteen with a job at a fast food restaurant, so that's why they all picked on me for working fast food. Eventually I became assistant manager of the restaurant at age twenty one, when I was almost done with college.\n\nMy sisters would often mock me for working in fast food, and my mom would too. It wasn't gentle ribbing or teasing, in a loving way. No. It was spiteful insults, trying to hurt my feelings and make me feel small. Speaking of feel small, I'm really tall (6'5\") and they also made fun of me for never trying out or being good at basketball or caring about any other sports.\n\nWhen my dad died he left everything to my mom, which is to be expected, including the house. He left me and each of my siblings ten thousand dollars just as some extra money, on the assumption that my mom would leave the kids everything equally upon her own death many years later. I already knew back then that my mom wouldn't leave me much, if anything, compared to my sisters. My sisters continued to live at home, but once I graduated college I moved across town to my own apartment. They weren't sad to see me go. I've been living on my own ever since. It's been going on almost twenty years now.\n\nI grew up in a rather large house (this was Kansas, where it was possible for a normal dude like my father to own a big home), so when my sisters got married, their husbands moved in, too. Their husbands are both college educated guys but I could tell they enjoyed the idea of not having to pay for their own house or any rent. My dad had built a small guest house behind the home which he always told me would be mine when I grew up, but after he died I could tell my mom had the place earmarked for her daughter and future son in law. My older sister and husband stayed in my former room in the big house.\n\nWell, whatever, right. I had my own thing going. These days I'm regional manager of a mid-sized restaurant chain (not fast food, but close haha) and although I'm not rich, I live quite comfortably. I could afford to put a downpayment on a house but I like the easy freedom of having an apartment. At thirty, I married my long-time girlfriend, who my mother and sisters always hated because she was Jewish and also eight years older than me. \"Your girlfriend is too old! She will never have a baby!\"\n\nWell, none of them came to my wedding even though they were invited. We actually conceived a baby but my wife miscarried. My mom and sisters found out about it and rather than express any condolences at a woman who just lost a child, my mom and sisters treated me to unsolicted \"I told you so\" and didn't send my wife so much as a card.\n\nI love my wife, and since we don't have kids, we have French bulldogs. We live in a big bungalow apartment with a yard for them, so whatever. My family mocks me for that, too. Like I'm not a man, because I don't have kids.\n\nIt's not like I accuse my sisters' husbands of not being men because they live in their mother in law's house. Everyone does their own thing.\n\nMy wife's family is somewhat successful in the furniture business and they're a lot nicer to me than my own family. My mother and father in law offered to buy me a new car (I drive a 2000 Honda Accord which is still in mint shape) just this year but I said no thanks, and they seemed to be impressed that I didn't accept gifts.\n\nWell, after all that background, finally my point.\n\nIt seems my sisters and their husbands have had all sorts of business schemes and tried to open their own yoga studio, because I guess my sisters are into that stuff. Sort of the whole \"Gee, I like coming to yoga class, so naturally I understand business economics and should open my own yoga studio!\"\n\nPersonally I thought that the kind of boutique, expensive yoga studio they had in mind was more of a Manhattan or Beverly Hills thing and not a small town thing, but whatever it was none of my business, they never asked my advice, so I never said anything. Plus my sisters' husbands both fancied themselves business savvy (one of them sells insurance, the other works as a new accounts person at a bank) so it's not like my counsel was ever needed.\n\nOf course they failed, and spectacularly so, and my mom foolishly put her house up as collatoral for the business. I'll admit that in a petty way I felt a bit of schadenfreude but overall I was upset especially because both of my sisters have small children (there are nine people living in my old house now).\n\nNow the bank is threatening to take over their house if they don't come up with a certain sum of money.\n\nIt's a lot of money, but money that I happen to have, and they know it.\n\nThey all approached me with appeals (by phone message and TEXT--they've always known where I live but have NEVER once come to visit me) to how I should be a good brother and son and how \"this is what my father would have wanted\" and all that. Neither of my sisters' husbands have said a word to me about it and I doubt I'll see one penny of my money back if I \"loaned\" it to them.\n\nMy mom especially has been laying it on thick about how she's an old woman and will be cast out of her \"familial home\" and all that. She's even gone so far as to hint that my \"rich Jewish wife's family\" can pony up the dough.\n\nI haven't yet returned any of their calls or texts yet.\n\nI'm still thinking about how they all always have a big Christmas party every year and never invite me or my wife, partly because they don't like me, and partly because they don't like the \"Jew.\" I know that if I confronted them about it they'd say \"you're family, you don't need to be invited, just show up,\" but I know DAMN WELL they don't want me there.\n\nMy wife says it's up to me whether I want to help or not, but she also says that there is power in mercy.\n\nI don't know, though. I think she's bigger than me in that way.\n\nI'm looking for some outside perspectives on what to do here.\n\nThanks for any advice, Reddit!!!\n\n\\---------\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR: my family has always been mean to me. Now they need money and want mine. What to do?\\*\\*",

There are 5 adults in that household that can work and come up with a means of either saving the house or finding other accommodations.  Your money would  only enable them to continue on their path of bad financial decisions.  \n\n   I am glad your wife's family is good to you both. Your time, money, and affection seems better served in that area of your life. ",
            "Dude, your family HATES you. I'm sorry, but they do. They've been showing you this all your life. Even now, when they're staring disaster in the face, they can't even pretend to be nice to you long enough to get the money. \"Rich Jew family\" - that's horrible. Really horrible, and they're saying it to the people who have the money that's meant to save them? No. Unless you want to reward them for a lifetime of hatred, and guarantee that they'll keep hating you forever, DON'T DO IT.\n\nETA: Sorry, I've just read the bit where your wife lost a child and they're still horrible. DO NOT give money to these people. How would your wife feel, if you gave cash to the people who've been shitting on her your entire marriage? She'd decide that their opinion was obviously more important than hers, and she'd have cold hard evidence to support that. You're in a marriage. You're meant to be on a team with your wife, not with the people who have tried to destroy you for your entire life. If not for yourself, stay strong for her sake. ",
            "So your \u2018family\u2019 mocked you as a child and robbed you of your rightful inheritance and then have the audacity to ask not only you, but your wife\u2019s family to pay for their failure. My blood boiled just reading the lack of shame your family has. There is power in mercy assuming the people you are showing mercy to have some shame, but your siblings and Mother have literally no shame. Why else would they beg you for money? Do not give them a dime. \n\nYou\u2019ve done the hard part by escaping them, and you seem to have built a happy life, which is great. So don\u2019t ruin it by giving into them and letting them back into your life. Like you said, you will not see a penny of it back if you loan it to them. It\u2019s a lose-lose situation. \n\nHonestly, if anything, I would be very petty and I would take this chance to mock them, and I don\u2019t consider myself a vindictive person. But after abusing and bullying you for years, they expect you to bail them out?! Fuck them. Your life will be infinitely better without them.  ",

            "Their treatment of you is awful. I hope you see that. I hope you're able to get counseling to grieve the loss of your dad, and of being so ignored as a child. You deserve time and space to get support for your family rejecting you.\n\nYour resentment is clouding this issue. You're looking at this like you finally have power over them to either give or withhold love- in the form of money- that you didn't receive. You are imagining that they need you and you can save them. Perhaps that they will even be grateful and invite you in to the Christmas party and to the love they share between themselves and to the family home. Well, no. No amount of money will buy affection. These family patterns are too deep. You resent their closeness and they in turn resent your success and independence.\n\nSo try to separate. Would you give the money to support your mother in retirement? Would you gift it with no reciprocation? Would you buy the house outright and ask for rent? Would you evict if they never paid? Would you have invested in the yoga business? Why invest now, when they've put everything in what you knew to be a losing investment?\n\nConsider why they're in this situation. Why is a household with 5 earners and no mortgage in dire straits? Haven't the husbands been saving for years? If they love the living situation so much, why don't they pitch in? What other options are available?\n\nKeep in mind that begging to you via text and calls costs nothing. They got everything they wanted from your dad with similar tactics. Begging, if you have no pride, costs nothing. It is cheaper and easier than taking out a HELOC, pooling all resources, getting a job, or dipping into savings. So to you, it seems like the last thing before the bank repos the house. But maybe not! You don't know. And you're considering giving your money emotionally without being in a position to explore all other options. That's their work. But don't let guilt drive the decision without knowing all the facts.",

They won't and will again expect you to bail them out, leading to a toxic cycle where adults don't have to take responsibility for themselves.\n\nIf you're worried about them being homeless and feel that you want to help them, offer to front the money for a security deposit on an apartment for them (don't co-sign a lease!!). \n\nHowever, I don't think you should feel the need to help them out at all. These people have made perfectly clear they don't value you or your wife, and giving them any amount of money just tells them that their behavior and actions until this point are acceptable. \n\nFinally - if they do get kicked out, see about buying your father's house if you feel an emotional attachment or want it to stay in the family. Perhaps your nieces/nephews will turn out a few black sheep as well who you can help out. ",

He needed some equipment early on, offered to sell me stock if I paid for it, and within the first year we became business partners because of it (I also cried after I gave him every penny of my life savings because I thought I was kissing it goodbye).\n\nThat's business ownership - accepting that most businesses fail and not putting anything into it you can't afford to lose. My situation worked out, honestly probably only by the grace of God. Your situation is different. I'm guessing the personal banker son in law suggested some type of HELOC to use the house as collateral. The higher ups at the bank would have to be starving to bite, business loans are separate from house loans for this very reason.

What your sisters did was incredibly cruel and callous. \n\nGiving them money will not cause them to reflect on their behavior. They'll be relieved they didn't have to face the consequences of their decisions, which they believe they are entitled not to face, and they'll move on. If you don't give it, they'll blame you for the loss of the home rather than reflect on the fact that it was their own decisions that lead them there.

The truth is these 5 adults need to humble themselves and get a job in the fast food business that they think they are above!  If they want to pay the mortgage to keep the house they have some decisions to make! People who treat others the way they have treated you your entire life and continue to treat you will only learn when treated the same. This cycle of behavior by them will continue no matter what you do.\n\nIt's important that we see people for who they really are and not just who we want them to be. Whenever we get to know someone we build up an idea of who they really are in our mind. Generally speaking this is not always accurate to who the other person really is. \n\nAn example would be getting angry at a cheating spouse or significant other. Getting upset and hurt that the person cheated is a valid response. However eventually one must come to terms that how we anticipated the person to act was contradicted to how they actually acted. If how they acted is who that person really is and we really love that person, we should love them for who they are. We should not love someone for who we imagine them to be. That's why forgiveness is important. Forgiveness is a way of processing the negativity so that it doesn't hurt us.  That being said, forgiveness doesn't mean you should stay in a relationship with someone who is bad for you, even if you love them. I know my example is for a relationship but it can applied to your situation with family relationships. You really sound like a great person born into a not so great family. Whatever decision you choose to make, do what makes you feel better. Your hesitation to help is absolutely justified and is your true feelings about the decision. Listen to yourself and you can never go wrong. \n\nBest of luck to you.",

Unfortunately, you can never, ever, win.\n\n\n\nIf you give them the money, they'll resent you for it.  If you don't, you'll never hear the end of it.  It's lose/lose.\n\n\n\nA suggestion might be to consult with a lawyer, and draw up some legal documentation for a proper loan.  You could then hold them to whatever stipulations the loan has.\n\n\n\nIn one version of the future, you might actually get paid back, but don't hold your breath.  In another version of the future, you could end up owning the house and charging them all rent. \n\n\nI make the loan idea because it's a middle of the road-type compromise.  You'll be able to say that you offered help, but you'll be hated for wanting repayment.  \n\n\nIt's unfair, but whatever happens, you're going to have to show a lot of strength.

They're straight racists (kinda stereotypical, considering the place). I have hard time expressing my feelings, but this is only time I felt infuriated reading. IDK why. Maybe because you're so good at letting things go, and overcome so many problems and negativity that, forgive me for saying, really make me jealous of such determination, but, at the same time, make me relieved to see a good person like you succeeding. So, you, who stood up by yourself, putting up with all the bad treatment, have the right to be selfish once. Not saying this because you deserve a revenge, but because you deserve a slack, or better saying, you doesn't seem to be a vingative person. I recommend talking this over with your wife once more, and lay in the table all the cards. This is one decision you don't need to make alone, your wife support you, and I think it would be good to tell her everything (if she doesn't know) of the treatment you both receive.\n\nAnyway, good luck op",

            "Others have already said everything that needs saying about the perils of giving in to this request.  \n\nI would like to tell you - you are allowed to make *whatever* decision you like here.  You don\u2019t have to balance the scale to decide.  That is, you could choose not to help them even if they had been the most loving, generous family in the world.  You could choose to help them now even though they have treated you appallingly.   It\u2019s not about what is deserved - it\u2019s about what *you choose*.  You do not owe them this help - and wouldn\u2019t even if they were stellar people.  \n\nThe people you described are people who have wasted riches.   They should have built capital not lost it - how can five working adults with no mortgage not accrue savings over more than a decade??  Their own folly has led them here.   Assume that they will not change their ways going forwards - this will not be the only time they run into financial trouble.  \n\nIf you *did* decide to help them, there are exactly two options.  \n\n1. Give them money freehold.  Don\u2019t loan it, don\u2019t expect it back.  \n2. Involve lawyers.  \n\nI\u2019m going to assume we\u2019re all clear on what 1 would entail and jump straight to 2.   You do have a strange opportunity here if you want to take it.  You *could* bail them out - on the agreement that you are purchasing the house.   It is possible to wrangle this to have the house and contents (especially antiques etc) put into your name, have some restoration of the inheritance your dad meant for you to have.  You would need to work out an absolutely ironclad contract with a lawyer - perhaps they would pay duties, maintenance and tax until your mom died?  Maybe a small bit of rent as well?   Maybe $x put into a trust each month to balance against your costs now - to be divided amongst the kids when mom dies?  Over years it could accrue at least as much as the house is worth, and in a trust fund it could not be whittled away.   And you would get the house as well as your cut of that trust money.   \n\nThat kind of thing is what you ought to consider.  It would need to be *bulletproof* legally, and you would have to *want* to do it.  The house would have to be worth the money and in fairly good nick.   It would mean tangling with your family - weigh the cost of that.   It could get messy and ugly.  It\u2019s risky.   But if you\u2019re keen to reclaim the property your father meant for you to have, if it is a sound financial decision (ie the house/land will increase in value not decrease) and if you can afford it, it *is* an option. \n\nThe safest option is to leave well enough alone - but you sound shrewd and canny enough to be up to this kind of task, should you decide you want to be.

Giving them tens of thousands of dollars so they can continue to live their lifestyle after they've made poor choices - that's plain-old enabling shitty behavior. They've treated you like shit for years - how on earth could you even consider this? It says a lot about how they manipulated you for your whole childhood that you'd even consider it. Somehow you've internalized this notion that it's reasonable to treat people like this, and there aren't really consequences. If you really want the house or the guest cottage, then offer to buy them outright at a reasonable market valuation, so that your mom can come out of it with some cash. But then that would be *your* house. Really though, I think it'd be better to just steer clear. If you wanted to buy a house, there are probably hundreds to choose from in your city - and I have a feeling that any number of them would probably be a better match for you than the one that you grew up in (and which your family would probably hate you for buying, in any event). Ditch these shitty people out of your life and find better people to be around.\n\nIf you've got extra money that you think should be used to help someone, then find some people who are actually in a bad situation that *wasn't* their own doing.

Maybe it will open their eyes, plus they get a taste of their own medicine if you cut ties with them afterwards. \nI'm happy that you found love in your marriage and your wife sounds like a wonderful person (and honestly fuck those antisemitic stereotypes does your family live in 1900?)

If it makes sense for you financially you could set up an educational savings accounts for them. Being able to go away to college sounds like it could be a very good thing. Maybe there are some other small ways you could be in their lives without exposing yourself to the adults' toxicity. I would probably send them stuffed animal Frenchies for a Christmas gift, but there are probably less petty things you can think of :)",

            "Honestly, your familial story sounds like the setup to a Brothers Grimm-esque fairy tale, and the decision is yours on which path this story will go. If you decide to bail out the family who has so meticulously scorned you, they will only feel validated by the outcome of the situation and learn nothing from this situation. If you respond to them refusing to pay their debts, they'll undoubtedly crank the guilting up to 11 to try to get you to crack, and there's just too much risk of that working for them. Personally, I suggest that you do not even honor them with a response. Cut ties completely. This sort of toxicity is something that doesn't need to exist in your life, and it's up to you to cut it out. This course of actions would force them to solve their problems themselves, and if they succeed then it will almost certainly force them to gain an iota of humility. If not, they'll only have themselves to blame for not being able to clean their own messes. There's a time and place to take the moral high ground, and this is pretty clearly not it.",

I agree with that, but let me take it a step further. Tell them no and then cut contact with them. This cycle of abuse against you is not going to stop even if you were to save their GD lives.\n\n I get that you worry about their kids. But the only thing you can do to help them is to take them out of that situation. To that effect, If they lose their house, consider informing CPS. I know it's a cold blooded thing to do, but really the kids would be better off without  such poisonous people. Who knows? Most courts would consider a close relative with a stable two person household over a complete wreck of a mother. \n\nJust some food for thought. ",

And if they're spouses are working as you've started, another option is for one of them to take out a loan. It sounds like at least 5 adults live there, I'm sure they can come up with a solution. It also sounds like you're an easy target for them like \"hey, before we put our necks out there, let's ask Bro to fork over the money\". \n\nEven if you give them the money, you're not doing anyone any favors. I'm guessing you're just delaying them losing the house in another few years because clearly none of them are good with money or decision making. You're basically enabling them which will later becomes society's problem and I don't want to pay for them ever. So please don't give them money or we'll all have to later.

Even in this day and age, there are guys out there who have never been shown how to do housework.

This is all the more likely if he had an impossible to please parent(mother especially) growing up.

        "selftext": "I (38F) am having trouble being there for my sister (32F), and I\u2019m not sure how to tell her why.\n\nI\u2019m about two years out of a 17-year marriage that ended extremely badly. We had issues throughout the relationship (as well as a lot of fun), but the last couple years he was intensely controlling, abusive, and violent, and since he left I\u2019ve done a lot of work to recover and get myself in a healthy headspace.\n\nMy sister went through a rough patch around the same time my divorce started, and I learned way too much about her husband (37M) during that period to ever trust him again. They\u2019ve been together for years and while he\u2019s never been my family\u2019s favorite (insufferable know-it-all, dominates every conversation, generally pretty annoying), we all just dealt with it because she loved him and we\u2019re adults. \n\nBut since their rough patch, I haven\u2019t been able to be around him. During that time he served her with divorce papers and told her he was going to take their <1 year old baby away and never let my sister see her again. He convinced my sister she would lose in court anyway, to the point that her plan was to give up, sign all the paperwork he gave her, and leave their baby while she moved out of state with our other sister. This all sounds bad, but my sister is extremely naive and also has the worst anxiety I\u2019ve ever seen. She was convinced she\u2019d lose their baby no matter what, and she was so broken down she didn\u2019t have it in her to fight. Anyway, she told me this plan and I successfully talked her out of it, got her a great lawyer, and she was on her way towards accepting their divorce and rebuilding her life when he suddenly changed his mind and they reconciled and have been acting like everything is fine ever since.\n\nDuring her eventually-abandoned divorce, my sister was terrified of being homeless and not having anywhere to go. I was starting over too, so our plan was that I\u2019d buy a triplex and she and her baby could live in one of the units, me in one, and our little brother (22M) in the third one. I went ahead with that plan and have just been renting out my sister\u2019s unit and let her know it\u2019s there if she needs it.\n\nI cannot be around my sister\u2019s husband at all. I\u2019ve seen behind the scenes. I know he\u2019s abusing her emotionally, financially, and I strongly suspect physically too, although she\u2019d never admit it. \n\nI am aware that the right thing to do here is support her decision, and grin and bear his company, but I can\u2019t do it. I get that it\u2019s immature of me, but the situation is too much like my own marriage, and I won\u2019t be within 100 feet of it. I especially don\u2019t want him in my new home, which for two years has been a happy, heathy, peaceful safe zone.\n\nMy sister basically won\u2019t leave the house without this man (because of her anxiety and also his control issues), and they are literally ALWAYS together. She posted on Instagram a few weeks ago about being sad and confused about why her family never spends time with her anymore. I\u2019d like to gently explain the situation to her, but I\u2019m not sure how to tactfully say \u201cit\u2019s not you, it\u2019s your awful abusive husband we can\u2019t stand.\u201d Looking for advice on how to softly tell her I\u2019m here if she needs me but that I\u2019m unwilling to be around her husband.\n\nTL;DR How do I tell my sister that I love her and want a relationship but that I can\u2019t be around her abusive husband because he triggers my own relationship baggage?",

            "This is tricky because right now, she\u2019s in a dangerous phase. The phase where they\u2019ve reconciled, and it\u2019s them against the world. \n\nUnderstand first and foremost: anything you say right now WILL get back to him. \n\nMy suggestion is to make it clear that you simply want to spend time with just her. Don\u2019t say it\u2019s an issue with him. Become a broken record and let her make the connection. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to me that you and I can spend time together just us. Can you find an opportunity for that?\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s gonna push. \u201cYou don\u2019t like him?\u201d And that\u2019s when you say, nope that\u2019s not it, nothing to do with him; it\u2019s really important to me that you and I have opportunities to spend time together, just us. \n\nKeep him out of it. Will it be very obvious that he is the problem? Yes. Can you afford for those words specifically to get back to him? Nope. You\u2019ll lose them both. She will follow him because you\u2019ll become the enemy. \n\nAsk after him. He\u2019s good? Good to hear it. Call her for catch-ups. Make it clear you want the relationship with her. This is not about him (even though *of course it is*). \n\nAs time goes on and they go into different phases of this cycle you\u2019ll be able to address things more directly. For now, I\u2019d start here.",
            "Seconding other comments. You **cannot** tell her you don't like him, no matter how much you want to. \n\nI was in a similar situation with a friend and their abusive SO.  SO was one of the most horrendous personalities I've ever met, AND hated me to boot, but still insisted on coming along to everything my friend and I did together. I became very proactive about scheduling girls' nights, hangouts while SO was out of town, and lots of activities SO hated with a passion. It was a good way to spend time with my friend and avoid the SO. I never badmouthed SO, no matter how difficult it was. Thankfully, they broke up, and my friend is now seeing someone wonderful. \n\nI don't recommend cutting off your relationship with your sister, nor do I recommend telling her why. She needs to realize on her own that he sucks, and she needs to know she's still got someone who cares about her and will offer her an out if she seeks it.",
            "I have had several friends in abusive relationships, and have had to learn how to support them without enabling or normalizing their abuse. \n\nIt's something I've talked to a lot with organizations that work with domestic abuse victims, and I've also talked a lot with people who have come out of abusive relationships themselves. \n\nThe things you want to avoid are: \n\n1. Pushing her to leave\n2. Always bringing the conversation back to how wrong she is and how badly she needs to get out. \n3. Putting her down for not leaving yet, or talking to her in a way that belittles her or berates her. \n\nPart of the reason you need to avoid these things is because the abuser is already doing them. He's already pushing her to stay. He's already belittling her ability to act for herself or stand up for herself. He's already telling her she is incompetent. Having two people yell the same thing at you doesn't help you see things clearly. And the abuser will always win out because he is able to be around her more and has shaped her view of the world. \n\nHere are things you SHOULD do. \n\n1. Treat her abuser like an abusive person. Meaning, don't spend time around him. Don't engage with him. You don't need to say anymore than \"I'm sorry, I can't spend time with him. But I'd love to see you.\"\n\n2. Try to keep a relationship that's just between you and her. Meaning, spend time one on one (if he lets her). Help her keep a life and identity outside of the relationship (something he's trying to keep her from doing.) This probably means saying \"I don't want to spend time around your husband, but I'd love to have lunch every week just the two of us.\" \n\n3. Express trust and confidence in her ability to handle herself and her agency in the situation. This is hard, because a person in an abusive relationship is NOT acting in her own best interest or acting with agency. But part of that is because her abuser is telling her she's worthless, nothing without him, useless, incompetent, and completely reliant on him. The way to combat that is to TREAT her like she's the person she was before her abusive relationship. So if she says \"My husband yelled at me for burning dinner\" instead of saying \"He shouldn't do that, he's so abusive!\" you could say \"Wow, that's awful, it must be hard to stand up for yourself to him but I'm sure you're going to be able to.\" \n\n4. Avoid blaming. Avoid blaming her for choosing him, blaming her for missing red flags, and blaming her for staying. She already feels ashamed of all those things. Shame paralyzes people. It makes them feel like they are stuck. You are trying to help her realize she's NOT stuck. In your situation I would make sure you are not blaming or shaming yourself for your abusive relationship around her. Abusers come in all shapes and sizes. We could all be manipulated into an abusive relationship by the right person. Abusers are very good at getting people to stay, otherwise they would have no one to abuse. No one should be ashamed of finding themselves in the situation, just empowered to leave when they are ready. \n\n5. Lean on the phrase \"when you're ready.\" It can be hard to listen to someone complain about being abused when they're not trying to leave or recognizing it as abuse. So if she has lunch with you and starts telling this story about him abusing her, you can say \"Wow, that's hard for me to hear. I hope when you're ready, you can stand up for yourself.\"\n\n6. Don't normalize the abuse by acting like the stuff she is telling you is okay. But you should use neutral, non-shaming or blaming language to react to it. \"That's hard for me to hear.\" \"That sounds awful.\" \"I wish you didn't have to experience that.\" \"I hope that changes.\" \n\nA way to mentally imagine the way you handle this is, someone is stuck in a burning house. They need to get out, but they won't move. You want to just run in there, throw them over your shoulder, and get them out. But you can't. They're too heavy, and they refuse to move. They HAVE to want to leave. So what you do is stand by the exit and hold it open. You're reinforcing that *there is an exit.* It's right here. They can stay if they want to, but it's their choice, and at any moment they want to leave, you'll be there to help them. \n\nYou have to be that doorway to leaving. Affirm who they are and help them keep a hold of their sense of self by spending time with them away from their abuser, doing things she likes, and talking about other things besides the relationship. This holds the door open and says \"Remember, there is a whole world outside of this person.\"\n\nUsing neutral language that isn't blaming or shaming her, or combative towards him, when she brings up abuse, reminds her that there is a whole world out there that thinks she doesn't deserve the situation she's in, and would support her if she left. Remember, he's saying \"This is your fault, if you weren't so X I wouldn't have to treat you this way.\" And you're saying \"Wow, that's awful, I hope there is a time when you aren't treated that way.\"\n\nAvoiding pressuring her, so she can cycle through her desire to leave or attempts to leave without feeling like if she tries to leave, and fails, she will be judged or even more isolated. (Most people take at least 8 attempts to leave an abusive relationship. So think of it as her starting to walk towards the door in the burning house, and then getting scared and going back. You just stay holding the door. The door is always open. She can start and stop, and try, and retreat, and nothing changes. The door remains open.)\n\n\nThat all being said it is also okay (and healthy!) to set boundaries with her about her husband. You can tell her that it's hard for you to be around him when he treats her badly, so you'd rather just hang out the two of you sisters. \n\nYou can say \"I am having a hard time hearing you talk about the way he treats you. I don't want to get involved, but can we talk about something else?\" Or \"It's really upsetting to hear you tell this story and knowing the situation you're in. I don't know if I can be a supportive listener without giving you advice you don't want to hear.\"\n\nAnd you can be pretty blunt. \"I love you, and I support you. When you're ready to leave, I'm here. But I can't handle listening to you talk about the way he treats you like it's normal. It's painful for me to know you're being treated that way, and I know you're not ready to leave, but I can't be a person treats this like a normal.\"\n\n(I will say when I've said the above to some friends, they stopped talking to me at all. That's a risk you take.)\n\nSometimes shutting down someone's ability to complain makes them have to actually deal with the things that are happening.",
            "My sister is in a similar boat, I can't stand her husband, so I just told her that so long as I have a home, she and her kids have a home. When she asked about her husband I simply told her \"I don't like him. I think he's abusive towards you. I will never help him. I will always help you.\" She's been coming for visits without him more and more over the years and stays longer and longer each time. I suspect it's practice for the eventual divorce, but I don't mention it. It's her life and she'll do it at her own pace. I'm just here to catch her if she falls. But yeah, let your sister know exactly where you stand and that you'll always be there for her no matter what. A lot of people stay in bad situations because they don't have a way out. Having a guaranteed way out is empowering. Good luck",
            "Thanks everyone for the (mostly) thoughtful advice. I\u2019m going to read through all the comments more carefully this evening, but I really appreciate all the input. I\u2019m under no delusion I can convince her to leave, and I\u2019m doubtful I could even talk her into any one-on-one time (though I will try). Still, it\u2019s been helpful to read all the different ways to broach the subject and let her know I\u2019m there for her. And yeah I agree bad-mouthing him isn\u2019t going to get me anywhere.",
            "I was in an abusive marriage. When I left, my family came out of the woodwork saying \"I never liked him\", etc. It was very hurtful.\n\nSo now if I see a friend in a shitty relationship, I TELL THEM. I would rather say something and lose a friendship than not say anything and something bad happen to them.   \nSometimes people just don't listen to reason, just be there when they snap out of it, especially if it's running from an abusive relationship. They will appreciate you more in the long run because you were trying to stand up for her. \n\nI don't know what you can do legally, but I know there must be information out there on family of people in abusive situations.",
            "Respecting her choice just means that, respecting it was hers to make and she made it.\n\n\"Sister, I love you and I accept your choice, but the way he behaved was unacceptable *to me.* I don't invite people into my life who treat others that way. I would end a friendship with any man who treated his wife the way he treated you. Just because you're ready to forgive him doesn't mean I am. I am still angry with him and I get to be angry with him. For our relationship as sisters to work, we're going to have to make time *as sisters*, without him involved.\"\n\nIf he has a problem with her seeing you without him (and he will) you will need to point out to her gently but clearly, that he is purposely isolating her from others who worked to protect her when he was at his most abusive and who would try to protect her again if he decided to harm her again. You can respect her choice if she doesn't want to see you, but you'll be here for her when she changes that choice.\n\nAll you can do is keep the door open and hope one day she walks through it.",
            "> I get that it\u2019s immature of me\n\nDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself, OP - you can\u2019t unlearn what you\u2019ve seen.  I would just tell her that, even if she is unlikely to know how to process it. \n\nFinding a good counselor for yourself could be an intro to her in the future.",
            "Whatever choices you make, know that the instant you tell her what you think of her husband, that it will probably get back to him and that he will isolate her from you. He will not let her hang out with you one on one, he will not let you see their children, he will poison her against you because that is how abusers keep control. You can't un-open that can of worms.\n\nFirst, I recommend individual therapy if you aren't already in it, and domestic abuse resources. Hotlines have an \"the person being abused is someone I know, not me\" option. Arm yourself with knowledge because this is a minefield to walk.\n\nThen, you probably only really have two choices. Adopt a civil but not warm relationship with her abuser, or not have a relationship with your sister until she leaves him (which she may never do). Narcissistic personality disorder support subs have great advice on how to be around narcissistic abusers that are pretty good advice for being around any abuser. Info diet, grey rock, all that jazz. Treat him like a coworker you would never, ever interact with outside of work but cannot tell how you feel or you'd lose your job. Pretend he's the boss' son everyone knows is a problem.\n\nWith your sister, don't tell her what you think about her husband. Ask her what *she* feels. Create a safe environment for her to tell you the truth without feeling scared that you'll judge him (or her) for it. Like a teenager you want to tell you if they're in trouble instead of getting upset with them for doing drugs or having unsafe sex or otherwise getting into trouble.\n\nIt's also valid to not be in a place where you can do this. But it's unlikely you get to have both a relationship with your sister and no relationship with her husband.",
            "Just be honest. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m always here if you need me and I\u2019ll come running when you\u2019re ready to get out of there, but I can\u2019t stand Chad and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t visit often\u201d.",
            "You're going to have to tread lightly. Especially since she's in the \"pretending this is fine\" phase. \n\nYou're going to have to be there for her during this phase and pry her away some before saying what you need to say. \n\nTell her that after going thru what you went thru, you can't be around men right now. That you need sister and girl time. Make it at places that are super girly or private, so his jealousy isn't triggered as much. Think pedicures, going to those girly tea time places that old ladies love. Post pictures on social media showing it's just you and her in those places and tag her so he sees. You want him to think you're safe too.\n\nAfter a few months of that, then you tell her.",
            "The one thing you *cannot* do is give her reason to believe that it's because of *him* in particular.  \n\nThe reason for that is because in the situation she is in, she thinks that you don't approve of him or of their marriage (in fact, if she thinks anything other than that you support him and their marriage completely), there's every likelihood that it will cause her to dig in her heels and cling to him even *harder*.  \n\nThe issues with and within her marriage are an issue for another day.\n\nRight now the important part is for you to maintain a connection with your sister, both for your benefit and for hers.\n\nCan you draw on that \"sister\" connection, and put it in terms about how you need to spend time with *her*, but because of what you went through in your own marriage, tell her that you need some \"girls only\" time with just the two of you?  \"Nothing about your husband, no, I just need to not be around *any* men for a while\", or something like that?  Or tell her that you have stuff that you want to discuss sister-to-sister that's private?\n\nThe goal here is to figure out ways of inviting her to spend time with you, without him, without it seeming like it's *him in particular* you are trying to exclude.  If it's \"all men\" that you need to be away from (because of your own history), or \"everyone but her\" you want to exclude, because you have a private matter to discuss, you at least have a plausible reason to get together with her and not him, that won't put her on the defensive about him.",
            "He knows you will try to convince her to leave. So any time she spends with you is dangerous for her. The abuse usually escalates when when the abused gets close to leaving or has just left. \n\nShe knows very well why her family is not spending time with them. Leaving him will have to be her decision. Invite her to lunch as a girls' thing and offer to pick her up. If she declines you'll know she's not allowed to leave or be with you without him.\n\nHave as much contact with your sister as you can but leave any talk /text about him and divorce out. He probably is listening and checking her phone.",
            "You cannot. She's to vulnerable, too weak, too brainwashed and basically living in Stockholm Syndrome. \n\nWhatever you will say, she WILL SAY IT TO HIM. He has the upper hand here and will use his manipulative tactics to even further make her not to communicate with you. \n\nYour only option IS TIME. \n\nAt one point things will go from bad to worse. SHE WILL SNAP, SAY FUCK THIS and reach out to you. \n\nThis may be in 2 years or 20 years. And you need to continue living your life while not eagerly waiting for her to reach out. She needs to understand she has made choices and those choices will impact how her family is with her. \n\nIt sounds cold and pretty heartless, but as a Narcissistic abuse survivor, you won't find the courage to leave until YOU ARE SICK AND TIRED OF LIFE. When committing suicide is just not an option you are willing to go through, the only thing left to do is FLEE. \n\nLive your life, pray for her. When she reaches out to you because shes \"done with him\", YOU NEED TO LAY IT OUT:  we are getting you an attorney to get you free RIGHT NOW AND get you a therapist RIGHT NOW. IM holding your phone because I don't want you to see threats hes making to you, I'll get you a burner cell. WE ARE GOING TO THE POLICE AND GET A RESTRAINING ORDER RIGHT NOW.\n\nThis must be BOOM BOOM BOOM \ud83d\udca5  QUICK because she will be paranoid and afraid. If she's staying with you, you must get top of the line video surveillance. So, if he attempts to break in, it's on video and that evidence could be used against him. \n\nSo, be strong. It's going to be a long waiting game.",
            "My advice may hurt you more than help, so maybe proceed with caution.\n\nShe's in a situation similar to yours. Put yourself in her place, as you've evidently been in, and think what you would've like to hear from your own sisters back then, what would've helped you when you felt like there's ultimately no getting away, at the darkest point.\n\nMaybe it still feels too raw, but even she's more codependent of him that you were of your ex, or she's more anxious than you were, think... I know you know what to say.\n\nDon't forget to take care of yourself too while trying to help her. She needs a lifeline, but you're totally in your right to take a step back if it feels like too much.",

            "Tell her straight up, short and to the point. I had to do this with one of my best friends and he appreciated my honesty and lack of mind games/sugar coating. It took time for him to get there and for us to heal our friendship, but it was worth it.",
            "You have every right to feel the way you do. That said your sister is smack in the middle of the make or break controlling phase that fairly dangerous in most relationships. She almost had a way out with the divorce but the husband likely backtracked when you got her a lawyer and he realized the win wouldn't be easy. \n\nI would just try to be there as I could be and help her to realize the situation she's in. She has to see it and want to escape. No one can help her but herself unfortunately.",
            "Don\u2019t tell her softly, tell her affirmatively that the statistics from this level of abuse to murder are staggering, she was given ample assistance to escape, and she instead returned to the person who has a statistical chance greater than zero of murdering her and her child. Abusers isolate their victims and you\u2019re cognizant of that but you will not let her decision impact your life and home. She is responsible for the danger she and her child are in bc the escape hatch was wide open and she chose to \u201creconcile\u201d with zero changes to the situation. After a separation or attempted divorce is THE most dangerous time for abuse situations and you do not want to enable her into being unalived. \n\nI would tell her in no uncertain terms you love her and are afraid for her and she\u2019s welcome to escape to you any time day or not but you will not cosplay in the abusive farce that everything is fine. It is dangerous and unacceptable and you cannot control her decisions but you can and will protect your own home from vicious hateful people. She may have difficulties but that does not exempt her responsibility for protecting herself and her child. She has greater resources than many people, mostly women but also men, who escape abuse for the sake of their children. You can\u2019t make her prioritize the wellbeing of her own child but you don\u2019t have to condone her living with a monster who only reconciled with her bc he figured out he was going to massively lose in court. I am a family law attorney and I can promise you 100% he stopped the divorce ONLY bc he wasn\u2019t going to be able to torture and abuse her with it the way he planned. He will either send her to a hospital or morgue from here, EVERYONE leaves their abuser eventually it\u2019s just whether it\u2019s on your own steam or in an early body bag. My dad\u2019s verbal abuse took twenty years off my mother, she\u2019s in the grave, guess how the vampires doing?\n\nShe is a parent, she MUST face reality and you are not her minder. She needs to take her feelings of discomfort and LEAVE him. I have had to put my foot down with several friends and family before bc abuse in my family history means I accepted all sorts of crap. I will not enable an addict to the abusive cycle, they\u2019re not incompetent they are unwell and no one can help unless they admit they have a problem and seek help. After ALL that she refuses to admit she has a deadly problem. The number one cause of violent death for women is intimate partner violence, it is easy to get tossed, hit your head on a table and that\u2019s lights out your child is at the mercy of a vicious predator. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t understand staying with him is that serious, then she needs to be told with zero softening. She is not a special snowflake, men murder their whole families escalating right on over the physical abuse all the time. You have EVERY right to want to distance from her decisions and protect yourself.\n\nI was in an extremely abusive and scary relationship and I escaped. I have represented a dozen women who escaped thinking their life was over. It was not, they are unanimously better off. She needs to be made aware of the gravity of the situation and her escape options and if she wants to drag you into it then she needs to understand for self preservation you will need to go no contact bc secondary trauma is VERY real. You don\u2019t deserve to be traumatized by their relationship as she lays it all at your feet. You absolutely can and should help her escape but do not enabler this ahole to keep abusing her by filling in as her therapist and helping her rationalize this god awful choice. I\u2019ve had guys go on to injure the child so badly they had permanent damage in order to torture mom, this is absolutely not ok.\n\nHe should be having supervised visitation every couple weeks for a few hours paying significant child support. THAT is what a court anywhere in America is going to order. Staying with this dude so he can potentially just crack and kill them one day is not in the best interests of her infant and I could not respect someone who decided their manageable adult fears outweighed real tangible risk to their kids. I have anxiety and PTSD, I get how scary it is and hard, but AGAIN she is not an invalid and is 100% responsible for her choices.\n\nIf he decides to flip that baby\u2019s high chair and it dies she better be prepared to go to jail for involuntary manslaughter. If she\u2019s not she better be ready to move. Abusers get WORSE with time, every single time, and from what you\u2019ve described they\u2019ve already exhausted all the runway. They\u2019re only in their 30s, this level of violence is not uncommon with the introduction of children. I honestly cannot stress enough how irresponsible of her it is to keep her child in that environment when other options exist so whatever you say to her frankly isn\u2019t harsh enough. \n\nGet her out of there!!! If you can\u2019t, distance and be very explicit exactly why with her. Sometimes you need someone else to tell you how it is bc you\u2019re so broken so just tell her. She may get upset but you\u2019re 100000000% justified in giving her the harsh unadulterated truth at this point. Giving up her out was beyond foolish and it\u2019s not your job to save her. Her husband is responsible for his abuse but SHE brought a child into this so she absolutely is responsible for their care and a self indulgent pity party rolling over is completely unacceptable for anyone older than maybe 26. She\u2019s grown, it\u2019s time she took it seriously.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this is so harsh but if she came into my office for a consult I\u2019d be terrified and telling her the same thing urging her to get out same day and filing a TRO tomorrow. What you\u2019ve described puts her in the highest risk demographic for *both* her and the child\u2019s mortality, if she tries to leave again she needs physical protection bc the stats of the second attempt after something like this are terrifying. For the love of all that is holy just Google some numbers on DV, send it to her and tell her you refuse to watch her suffer. I can\u2019t believe her attorney didn\u2019t throw a full on fit trying to keep her from dismissing and didn\u2019t countersue. Absolutely not trauma informed whatsoever, I require my DV clients seek immediate counseling exactly for this reason, bc their support system and self esteem is eroded to nothing, absolutely asinine outcome. Reconciled my whole butt, that man just didn\u2019t like he was going to have to pay something and not get his way, SANE people never make these threats and it\u2019s misperception alone thinking \u201coh yea guys threaten to completely alienate the mother all the time.\u201d NO NO NO they absolutely DO NOT like 90% of the time. The people that do this aren\u2019t only always abusers, they are super sick and I have won supervised visitation EVERY SINGLE TIME over almost 10 years? Why? Bc they\u2019re abusive openly! They\u2019re openly sociopathic so it\u2019s easy to prove. This situation is scary scary scary. GET HER OUT OF THERE!!!!!!",
            "You should take her out to brunch while he is at work and have a pleasant day with her.   At the end of the time together, tell her she is family and that you got her back if she needs you.   All she has to do is call and you will be there, with whatever is needed.    Leave it at that.  She can read between those lines.  Good Luck.",
            "I completely understand not wanting to be around him as it can also trigger you regarding your past relationship.\n\nBut your sister will need support when it happens again, and if you're not there, she will most likely go through all that anxiety and be his emotional punching bag again.\n\nAs much as it kills you to see her with him, be there for her so when shit hits the fan again, she has to you there for her.\n\nWhen someone who is in an emotionally abusive relationship loses their support system, it pushes them further to stay with their abusive partner as they feel they have no one else there for them. \n\nPlus you should look at it as you keeping an eye on him. If he catches wind that you don't want to be around him, he will probably isolate her from you and ban you from visiting the house when he's not there.\n\nKeep your friends close, but your enemies closer.",
            "As someone who also went through a similar divorce as you, you can see it unfolding for your sister. However, you can also see she isn't ready to leave, yet, just like we weren't until we made it happen. It's a tough place, because you want to support her, but know nothing will have her leave him until she's ready to. \n\nOne of my biggest issues when leaving was also safety and where would I stay, would he be able to find me. We know it's not as easy as just \"leaving.\" I briefly took my daughter to a shelter, and thankfully he ended up moving back home with his parents. There isn't enough legal support for women. It didn't matter when I called police (they said he still lived there and has a right to be there, even with violence), and when I involved my lawyer for custody, was actually told no one would believe me about the violence or abuse because if \"it really were that bad, I would've abandoned my house to live permanently at a shelter.' ...while simultaneously trying to hold down my job and worry about child care? \n\nHaving been there, try to offer support as much as you can, but I can also understand it to be traumatizing and bring up your own anxieties. Have resources ready for her when she Is ready to go. Unfortunately it may take her some time, and not everyone does ever leave these situations.",
            "I read a very [good comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xhh3pi/comment/ioxz9ii/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on one of the relationship subs from a person who was in an abusive relationship highlighting all the things NOT to say and how to phrase it instead to help someone in this type of situation and I'd like to post it here because I think it could help.\n\n>I was so mad at my family for assuming that there was something wrong with my previous abusive partner and now hearing you talk ab what you see going on with your sister it all makes sense to me. I am going to give you my biggest tips as to how to maintain a relationship with your sister while she is going through this.  \nstart by saying something like hey I miss you. DO NOT ever say \"Hey I miss you, all you do is spend time with Justin\" do NOT let Justin be your focus. you have to try everything you can to rebuild trust with her. If she ever says \"well you never loved me bc xyz\" say \"I am so sorry that I have not been better to you. I have been on my own journey of growth but you should have never experienced any unkindness and i hope you can forgive me\" validate her feelings bc if you do that and give sincere apologies (even if whatever shes accusing you of is bs) he cant manipulate her into thinking that you guys never loved her. always focus on her, not on him. and be REALLY nice to him. bc then he cant isolate her by saying you guys ignore him or give him dirty looks or something. make sure he knows hes welcome in yours/your moms house whenever he wants, so that your sister will be able to recognize his isolation.  \nONLY say something ab her partner after months of attempting to establish this relationship with her, and after she has told you multiple toxic/abusive things he has done- I want to express several, bc if he winds up hitting her, and you've already expressed concerns ab him, she might not tell you. And when he has hit her, thats the optimal time to convince her to get out and call the police, you can literally look up domestic violence statistics to show her etc, try to convince her not to go home, and press how even if she stays w him, calling the police will help her potential future children and his future girlfriends-  \nIf you want to start the conversation earlier, ask things like \"why are you smiling different in your pictures? what did you do with the extra money you had after trading in your car?\" etc but at separate times and never when her SO has just been mentioned, so she wont think youre implying that its about him. abusers train you to be extremely protective over them, and to cut off anyone who has anything bad to say about them. let your sister know you are here for her always, and an unjudgmental space. ask questions ab her partner concerning romance, like what did you do for valentines day, etc etc. So she is comfortable talking to you ab him, he will eventually convince her to not talk ab him w other people, bc she will accidentally spill abusive things ab him bc she doesn't realize they're abusive. When she all of a sudden starts clamming up (after youve rebuilt connection) mention to her that its not healthy to keep everything inside, and if anyone would have her hide things from her loved ones, there is no excuse bc they are asking her to choose them over her mental health. but waaaiiitt to do that stuff  \nINVITE HIM AND HER OVER TOGETHER. Make him feel like he has successfully manipulated you too. that is so important. try to come off as dumb to him. the only person my toxic manipulative ex husband was ok w me continuing my relationship with was my friend who has special needs, bc he never thought she would catch on. Every emotional abuser I have ever known of was like that.  \nALSO encourage her to get a reddit account if she doesn't already. bc hopefully, eventually she will come to reddit. tell her you LOVE the relationship threads bc of all the drama, and have her subscribe to them. Reddit helped me fall out of love w my ex husband bc when I told ppl ab him on here they have all validated that he is insane and horrific. It helped me recognize abusive tendencies in him I wouldn't have otherwise, and helped me realize I ONLY am insecure ab some things bc he gave me those insecurities.  \nask her to share the good parts of their relationship regularly, so that way she cant say \"well hes so good bc of this and this that you cant see\" you can say, i know you have strong feelings for him, but the bad is outweighing the good things youve told me, and honestly nothing good could outweigh this much bad.  \nI would also consider more positive affirmations for her. Maybe telling her something like that you think she deserves the world and know she'll get it someday. whatever feels right to you  \nEdit: typos. also, thanks guys, this is my first time ever revieving awards! I hope everyone who has a loved one in a similar situation sees this. There is not much you can do in this situation besides love and patiently wait, but this is everything I can think of that might have helped. Also hearing from his ex gf's might have helped bc im a girls girl and if i had known how he'd treated them I would have been able to see him clearer. but most arent like me in that way.  \nI also might edit and add a little bit of advice as I think of it as time goes on\n\nEdit: formatting was weird, had to fix it",

            "I wonder what the other side of this is. It sounds like you were both planning to leave your husbands around the same time, and I'm sure that shared misery bonded you. But then she stayed with her husband. You feel betrayed, resentful, maybe even jealous that they've reconciled. I suggest you focus on the things within your control: like your responses and feelings. Don't try to make your feelings your sister's problem. You feelings about her marriage are, frankly, none of her business. Your feelings aren't really about HER marriage, anyway. Don't talk to her about this, talk to your therapist.",
            "I would tell her right in front of him. Put him on the spot. He probably hasn't been singled out to his face. Put him in check. It's you're goddamn sister. Otherwise leave it alone. Those are the two paths in my opinion. As u had said you were being adults by accepting him cause she loves him, she needs to be adult enough to understand what the results of her choice to reconcile with him is. In a situation like this u just wish he could go away and be the one feeling like shit for being abusive but the reality here is you're sister is going to suffer and continue to suffer if she doesn't begin thinking for herself. And not even you can make her do that.",

            "Not trying to be mean here but considering both you and your sister seem to have failed marriages there seems to be issues with the two of you as well. Family members generally have a lot of the same problems due to being raised similarly.\n\n I point this out because a lot of people and woman especially are always blaming the other person in the relationship while not being critical of themselves at all.  They will make these post about relationship problems and it's always them talking about their partners issues while having zero  self awareness. \n\nYou can run from your marriages but you can't run from yourself. I hope you don't expect to have different results if you get remarried. You might not have the same issues but don't be surprised if the end result is the same. \n\nAs far as your sister goes I would personally try to spend time with her. If she feels like he is the only one she has don't expect her to leave him. She likely sees her self in a situation where if she leaves him she will have no one since she hardly sees Family. Why would she expect it to be different after she leaves him?",
            "You have great advice on here about keeping the relationship with her open without having to deal with her partner.\n\nIn my work with abused spouses I learned that it takes an average of 7 tries for someone to actually leave the abusive spouse.  This may have been the first try for her, or the 5th.   Just know that it might not be as fast as you would like. \n\nKeep the lines of communication open with her.  Don't badmouth her partner.   Share how great you are doing.  Share pics of how you decorated the triplex.  \n\nTake care of yourself!  You're a great sibling",
            "I am sure you did right to go forward with the triplex and I personally would always repeat to her that it will be ready if she and her child decide to move there.

You can totally stay, and keep managing this cycle of abuse, I just want you to know that you don't have to.\"\n\nFollowed by,\n\n\"You need to be in therapy right now.\"\n\nIt took both for me to get out. First, I needed people to actually tell me that life could be better than I had it. That it didn't have to be that bad all of the time. That it wasn't a normal relationship. That I was being scared and gaslit into staying. It actually took three people saying that to me. Then I needed therapist (and actually a second therapist, a marriage counselor) to work through it with me.\n\nIt still took years for me to leave. I still had to plan my escape very carefully and with the help of multiple friends.\n\n\\*Note: I don't have any idea what's right for her situation. That's just what *I* needed.",

By no means do you have to spend time with him.",

Do not blame him, because as others have said, they\u2019re in the \u201cthem against the world\u201d phase of reconciliation. \n\nSo you need to make it about you. \u201cHey sis, I love you, but my husband left me with scars and sometimes when I\u2019m around your husband he says or does things that remind me of my ex, which makes it hard for me to be around him. I\u2019m not blaming him or saying he does it deliberately, and I don\u2019t want to lose you from my life, but right now I\u2019m just too emotionally raw. Can we please still hang out, just you and me?\u201d \n\nI mean, clean it up and make it more relevant to your relationship with her and your ex, but _don\u2019t_ blame or accuse him of any kind of behaviour. If you do, she will turn against you, or worse, she\u2019ll tell him what you said, and _he\u2019ll_ convince _her_ to cut you out of her life. You don\u2019t want that. For either of your sakes. So keep it as a \u2018you\u2019 problem and not a \u2018him\u2019 problem. Plus, that will likely make her want to support you even more, which may help her to stand up to him and allow her to see you alone (not so you can convince her to leave him, but it might help her feel a sense of independence that she wants to expand).\n\nBut don\u2019t, do _not_ bad mouth or criticise him to her. She will not be open to it. You can pose ideas or hypotheticals that might make her think, or talk about the shitty things you know both your ex and her husband are guilty of in the hopes of subtly causing her to consider things, but don\u2019t do it openly or obviously. It will not end well and you will lose her.",
            "I think there is a lot of really good advice here for how to care for the relationship between you and your sister. I'm wondering if you are also feeling guilty that you can't around him since he triggers your own baggage? Especially since you want to show your sister you are supportive of HER but can't be around HIM that must feel like you have no way to show her as he's always there.\n\nI really love the ideas of telling her you want to have sister time. And sister/baby time too, and doing things that he might not be interested in but she would do.\n\nI think for **yourself, it's good to remember that boundaries are you stating to  yourself what you're comfortable with**. And they're a statement of the kinds of behavior you expect, so that you can be healthy. You can't control whether or not someone will respect your boundaries (he might try to tag along to pedicures, for instance). But you can decide how you respond to that so that you are comfortable and so that other people know what you expect. They might not like what you expect, or give you what you expect, but you can tell them and shut it down if you don't get it. \n\nThis is a super basic example of what I mean, but I used to be a teacher and now I work in a job where sometimes I have to be the chat support person for middle and high school students. Occasionally they think I'm a robot and so they say rude things. I'm a nonentity on the other end of a website and honestly, I could just ignore it. But I tell them how that affects me in a very basic way: \"I don't like being called stupid. That hurt my feelings.\" or \"I don't appreciate being spoken to that way.\" They might continue on saying those things. I can't control them. But I can leave the chat or warn or ban them. I state *my expectations*: I deserve to be spoken to politely. *My boundary*: If you do not, I will end this conversation. \n\nIf he came along to the nail salon you might say something like, \"Oh, Sister, I'm so sorry you misunderstood! I was looking forward to sister time. Let's reschedule for a time we can make that happen. I'll give you a call to find out when works for you! I love you! Bye!\"\n\nThe important thing is *you* decide what is healthy for you and when he steps over that boundary you take yourself out of that situation. You hold the line for yourself because your sister needs someone who knows how stay firm in their boundaries to help her when she is ready to go.",
            "I was recently in an abusive relationship like your sister. My friends and family who were privy to my ex\u2019s behavior began to resent me and my na\u00efvet\u00e9 and started to victim blame me and it messed up my friendships. That didn\u2019t help me to leave at all. Most of my friends and family didn\u2019t understand that leaving is a process, and that it takes an average of 7 attempts to leave an abusive relationship. They began to call me a liar when I decided I wasn\u2019t coming back, and then he would manipulate me and suck me back in. My friends and family decided they didn\u2019t want to talk to me anymore, and it only further isolated me and made me want to stay with him more because it felt like he was there for me when they weren\u2019t. What actually helped me to leave is my friend who was consistently there for me and didn\u2019t say anything judgmental towards me. She kept pushing me to see that his behavior was abusive and not normal and pushing me to see reality, and even offered her place for me to stay. If it weren\u2019t for her, I likely would have been stuck in that relationship for much longer. I say this to show you what it\u2019s like on your sister\u2019s side. Please have empathy for her, and realize that if he\u2019s gaslighting her, she may begin to doubt reality and subscribe to his. You may be tempted to shun her until she sees the light, but that isn\u2019t helpful either. Please keep in mind that it can be tempting to submit to his untrue and delusional narrative. Leaving is a process, and even just seeing an abusive relationship for what it is is a process. This is all part of the cycle of abuse. I highly suggest reading up on abusive relationships and calling the Love is Respect Hotline if you\u2019re frustrated or concerned- they have great people who are very helpful. \u201cWhy Does He Do That\u201d by Lundy Bancroft is also a helpful book.",
            "Try a fun girl active but makes sure he comes . Always invite both . Go places where he won\u2019t like but still invite . But don\u2019t tell her where y\u2019all are going and make sure you drive . Make sure it\u2019s super girly",
            "Tell her before it\u2019s too late",
            "You\u2019ve all seen how awful he is when he was trying to divorce her and then realized his control was slipping. Just list the things you stated that he did that you all witnessed and explain thats why they don\u2019t want to be with him. Maybe if your sister get a clear pic of what\u2019s going on and how her life will look living with this man she might snap out of it. But if it just look like you\u2019re all avoiding her of course she run to him. He is not honest, don\u2019t do the same with her.\nKnowing why people don\u2019t hang out with you is better than nothing. Might still hurt but you\u2019ll know why. She\u2019s not any less sad if you slowly back away from her.",

            "I don't think it's at all immature of you to not be able to be in this mans presence. Your sister made her decision but you also have a right to your own boundaries and I think its reasonable that you feel that way. Like so many threads posted here your situation is what I refer to as a \"bowl of shit\" situation in that there is no pain free way for you to get what you need. \n\nYou sound mature and level headed so I think you already know that you need to communicate with your sister about how you feel and you need to be ready for her to not totally understand or agree with it. It sucks because you obviously care for her a lot and have her best interests at heart but sometimes putting your foot down regardless of the consequences is the best thing you can do for a person. I also think it couldn't hurt to make it clear you are and will always be there for her regardless but that you refuse to suffer someone who would treat your family (or likely anyone else) that way.\n\nI applaud you for being there for a family member and I am glad you managed to get yourself out of a bad situation as well, I hope your sister is able to see the light and get out of the bad situation herself. Best of luck to you.",
            "Honey, I think the best way is to be honest. I'm pretty blunt so I go with that. I would just tell her, your husband has serious problems, none of us are comfortable with him, we are worried about your safety, and offer her a place to live at least temporarily. I think she needs to physically get away from this guy for a while just to know what normal life might feel like again. Some people spend so long in prison they come to prefer it because they're afraid of what independent life would be like. The insecurities & unknowns of it. Whether they're up for it.  She needs to be in a safe place at least for a while where she can have some freedom. It's probably better if she can physically stay with family members so there are people around to protect her in case he becomes abusive. But that's where I would start.  Until she starts to see that her situation, which she has normalized, really IS unhealthy and unbearable and she is able to see physically how life could be different, she will be too afraid to move and too unaware that life can be different. The bandaid has to come off.  Be wary of him though, he might get really nasty if his dolly gets away....you might need restraining orders. But if you all love her, you can't just let her die in his prison.",
            "Honestly I have a sister also in a toxic marriage. He puts hands on her, brainwashes her and constantly yells at her. Everyone in my family tried having an intervention with her but she got very defensive and told us to mind our business. She said she made a promise to god when she married him and can\u2019t divorce him. She also said he\u2019s the man of the house and this is how real men are\u2026 I don\u2019t allow my son to spend the night at her house anymore since she married him. Sometimes there\u2019s nothing you can really do but focus on your own life and let her learn the hard way."

The conversation was difficult to have, but it needed to be had. There were questions I needed to ask for my health (such as STIs and such). Though he did say he used protection, I still scheduled an appointment with my doctor for this coming weekend.\n\n\n*Edit to add this part in [I overheard Jim's phone call with Derek. He told Derek what had happened and ended his relationship with them. He also said he is quitting his work tomorrow. I do feel bad but know that is purely his decision. ]\n\n\nJim will be moving back into his parent's place tomorrow. I will be canceling my lease tomorrow morning. I did contact my best friend from back home and simply explained that I will be returning home. He offered to fly up here to help me, but I said no because I know I will break down. Right now, I need to keep strong. Seeing a friend here will only allow myself to break down into a huge mess.\n\n\nI'm doing my best to stay positive. I keep telling myself, \"Better now than later. Good thing it's only been just a year and not five or more. Think of this as a life lesson. Do not hold grudges and do my best to move forward.\" It's hard, I admit, but continuing to tell myself those things helps me. I would love to believe that this experience has not swayed my views on relationships; rather, I would love to believe that this experience and relationship has revealed a little more of myself. I still need to do a lot of reflecting but that can come after I have done all the physical work (moving back to my home state).\n\n\nAgain, everything seems to be happening so fast but it's progress. Thank you all for your kind and loving support. I hope my experience and progress can be of some hope for others. I love my boyfriend extremely and though I did not mention it in the post, I did make a lot more sacrifices for him than he has ever for me. Through all that, I don't see it as losing an investment in someone but rather I am moving on for a healthier opportunity and hopefully he will be able to learn from this as well. I have no plans on getting back together with him. His words were sweet and tempting, but they were poison.\n\n\nThank you again :)\n\n* Original Post \n\n\nHi reddit,\n\n\nI am extremely heart broken and am in need of advice and even comfort. I don't want to use real names so I will be putting in different names. Thank you for understanding.. Let me share with you all on what happened. \n\n\nI [25/f] have been dating my boyfriend [23/m] - we will call him Jim, for a year now. It was long distance at first, but I moved to his home state in August so that we can be together physically. Everything was perfect. Jim and I were extremely happy with each other, always communicated, and we were just a happy couple. \n\nHe works at a cafe and there he befriended one of his coworkers [23/m - we will call him Derek]. Derek has been inviting Jim to get a few drinks after work, and the two became good buds. I've met him before and he was really nice. Jim thought he was a cool guy too. Then in mid-October Derek would invite my boyfriend over to his place. They'll just hang, order pizza, and drink some beers apparently (Jim would text me that he would hang out with Derek after work then come home. I never required him to text me where he was, but Jim was always sweet to text me messages throughout the day. I did the same for him too.). Throughout the entire night, Jim would tell me how he met Derek's girlfriend [24/f we will call her Karen] and that they were very nice people. I texted him back that it was awesome and sweet how the two invited him and shared a good time with him. I thought that was just that. \n\n\nSo Karen and I have never seen each other. All I knew about her was that she was Derek's girlfriend, she was nice, and also I learned that she and Derek moved in together like early October. I thought that was pretty cute. That's all I knew about her. My boyfriend started to hang out at their place more often, and I would only think of it as something as coworkers/friends just hanging out after work. I do admit that I felt left out and even asked Jim if I could hang out with them. He would say it would be a hassle since then he would have to come get me from my work or at home then go to Derek's place and also that they only hang out for a short while. I just would say \"Alright\" and be done with it. \n\n\nI had a day off work and texted my boyfriend that I will come over to his work place to have lunch together. He told me that would be awesome so I went. It was pretty busy in there, but not super busy where the workers wouldn't be able to casually talk. I noticed my boyfriend working and one other girl. Between orders, this other girl would be touching Jim's arm and would smile at him. She would act really flirty with him...and my boyfriend seemed totally fine with it. It hurt because 1) he was letting another girl flirt with him and 2) he always felt bothered if I would flirt with him in public - mind you, I'm not all handsy, but I do playfully hug his arm. \n\n\nWell Jim didn't notice me in there so I just kept to myself. Until several of the customers walked out, Jim finally noticed me. We went out for lunch, but on our way out I asked him, \"Who is your coworker?\" and he told me it was Karen. I asked him if he found her attractive, and he said word for word \"Honestly, not really. She's not ugly but she's not pretty or anything.\" \n\n\nI told him how I felt about him and Karen acting that way in the cafe, and he only told me it was meaningless since that's how Karen is. I tried extremely hard to just kill my jealousy, but it really hurt me. I cried in the kitchen after Jim had gone to sleep that night. \n\nA few days after that event, Jim would be going to Derek's place after work and would come home really late. Earlier today he told me he would be hanging out with Derek again, and with my own insecurities boiling inside me, I asked Jim to stay home with me a few times of the week because we rarely saw each other due to our work schedules. We ended up arguing, and in my anger I snapped at him saying something like, \"Fine then you can go to your little threesome.\" His face went pale and just a sick feeling made me believe that what I had said out of anger was actually true. I asked him and he admitted it.\n\nI ultimately found out that my boyfriend has been having a threesome with Derek and his girlfriend after work almost every day since October. I asked Jim if he was bi, but Jim said they were just sharing Karen and it meant nothing - it was only sex. It hurt. A lot. Jim and I shared the same views that an open relationship never could work for us, that sex with another person while in this relationship would be viewed as cheating, and so on (he was the one who set down the ground rules, and I agreed to them - we both were very monogamous). At least I thought. \n\nI am completely heartbroken. Jim is in the other room just sitting at his desk, and I'm in the bedroom bawling my eyes out while seeking some sort of help from reddit. Honestly, I have no friends here. The friends I have back at home didn't want me to go and we left on bitter terms. I'm ashamed to reach out to them for help. I just can't shake off this feeling of utter disgust and betrayal. I love my boyfriend so much. So very much. A pathetic part of me wants to just work on our relationship, but that is just a horrible choice. I know I should leave him and go back home or whatever.. but right now I'm just in shock. \n\n  \n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Found out my boyfriend has been having a threesome with his coworkers. I am extremely heartbroken. How did anyone who experienced infidelity such as this cope and/or move on? What would you advise me to do?",

            ">Jim and I shared the same views that an open relationship never could work for us, that sex with another person while in this relationship would be viewed as cheating\n\nYou both previously agreed on being monogamous and chose to commit to this monogamous relationship. He betrayed your trust and relationship, that's all there is to it. \n\nIt is your choice as for what to do, but getting over such a betrayal is a difficult thing to do. And just know that he didn't confess to you out of respect of guilt, you just happened to get it out of him. If that didn't happen, how long would he continue deceiving and cheating on you?\n\nEdit: spelling",
            "Step one: accept that \"Jim\" is a cheating douchebag and your relationship is over.  You don't seem like the type that could accept or forgive this kind of major infidelity - but maybe I'm wrong about that.  Only you know that answer.",
            "Just read your edit, I'm so proud that you've taken charge and you're doing what's right for you.\n\nI'm sorry that this has happened to you, but I have no doubt that you'll come out of this stronger and far more capable than you ever thought you could be. Good luck <3",

I hope you don't change because of this, you seem like a really cool and laid back woman, the sort of friend I'd like to have. \n\nYou know you need to leave this mess. It's going to be hard but I can guarantee your friends and family will welcome you back with open arms. Go. And heal. ",

            "Wow, just wanted to say your attitude is inspiring. I'm currently heartbroken due to an extremely raw and painful breakup and reading your post brought me a lot of comfort, so thank you. It probably won't make you feel better right now, but you sound way too good for this asshole. Just from reading that it's clear you deserve so much more. ",

Please dont be sad, like honestly and very seriously, you are SO MUCH BETTER OFF away from these three losers. I know these are just words on a computer screen but my god, you dodged a flaming bullet. You've done the right thing for sure. I genuinely wish you all the best. Move back home, cry for a few days, then become a bad ass woman and start weight training, it's electrifying and a massive boost all round, mind and body. ",

Do not hold grudges and do my best to move forward.\"  \n\nFocus on this, the sooner you get rid of negative emotions towards him and move on, the more it will help you. Discourage even your friends from refering to him with negative references (jerk, a..hole, ...etc),  forgive him, and in your memories remember him as someone with weaknesses.\n\nAll the best. You will find happiness soon and bring a lot of the same to another lucky someone.",
            "Good to hear you're staying strong and moving back home. Also, don't feel like you made a mistake, or feel guilty for moving to be close to him. You were pursuing something that meant a lot to you and Jim took advantage of that. You're stronger and wiser because of it. ",
            "Glad to hear your edit! Nice work. I can't imagine how horrific that would be - I'm sorry I don't have any Wisdom to give. But you're doing the right thing and I 100% agree, thank god this didn't happy years down the track. He didn't deserve you. What the shit was he thinking? Ugh it doesn't matter fuck 'im. ",
            "huuuuge internet hug :-( what he did to you was awful, and you're better without him. ",
            ">Right now, I need to keep strong. Seeing a friend here will only allow myself to break down into a huge mess.\n\nIt's okay to break down. You don't always have to be the strong person. I'm not a particularly emotional person myself (which sometimes people think is strange because some people have just expected me to be more emotional than I am because I'm a woman) so I totally appreciate the need to be strong in these circumstances. So that being said, Maybe it's good that you stay strong while you leave (you don't want any temptation to take him back in a moment of weakness), but just know that once you're back home around people that truly care about you, it's okay to cry and break down and do whatever you need to do. Grieve the relationship. You felt that it was serious enough to uproot your life to be closer to him which is a big change, so it's okay to want to mourn that loss. While you might have left on bitter terms, I'm sure they will all understand when you explain the situation (apologize if there are any apologies deserved and don't be afraid to admit you made a mistake because this wasn't a mistake you were *definitely* unable to avoid - I mean, I don't know what your friends thought about you leaving and if there were any signs, but you don't always know somebody will be cheating on you every day with their coworkers). It will all be okay and as you said, it's definitely a \"better sooner rather than later\" scenario as you are still young enough to bounce back and learn from this experience.\n\nBest of luck!",
            ">BF wants threesome\n\n>Doesn't include GF\n\nYep, fuck him, move on.",

            "Good for dumping that cheating doche. love yourself and never let anybody take advantage of you. \n\nOk, Sorry I know this is a serious post, but I just gotta ask. So did you name your bf and the other after Jim and Karen from the office? \n\nIt would make sense since you would be Pam in this scenario, and I never liked Jim and Karen together to begin with.",
            "No one ever deserves what you had to go through. I hope Jim comes to regret his decisions and realizes you can't do that to someone. It's upsetting but sometimes people need to make that mistake to realize you shouldn't ever betray someone's trust like that :/\n\nThis may not help, but on the positive side you have another 60 odd years to meet someone you'll be equally as, or more head over heels than Jim. And you will find them.",
            "Dump him it's not worth it. ",
            "I know that feeling and know what you mean,  I'm sorry this is happening to you.  It'll get better. Acceptance,  It's a cold bitter pill. Honestly,  if this is something he wanted to pursue he should have asked you if you wanted in on a 4 some.  Without you,  everything about this was wrong.  \nGood luck OP,  bigger and better things lie ahead. XO",
