        "selftext": "I was dating my boyfriend for 2 years (we didn't live together but lived on the same street and I was always over at his place). We each had kids from a previous relationship so I wanted to take the whole \"living together\" thing slowly, but we were together all the time (and I just maintained my own residence).\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe commuted for work, and I knew his department got a new secretary.  She was younger and married and had recently had a baby.  I knew they were work buddies and I even bought a birthday gift for him to give to her.  After about a year she moved to another State.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I decided to move in together and we lived together for a year when I found out that he and that secretary had some type of (non physical but still romantic) relationship while they were working together. And that is why she ended up leaving (because they both realized it was not appropriate).\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nI stumbled on old emails between them that were strange. Calling each other pet names. He was calling her baby and sweetie in work emails. Telling each other that they couldn't wait to see each other at work. Meeting up in the cafeteria for coffee every day. He told her he loved her. She lamented that she couldn't stop thinking about him while at home. They had little quarrels.  I also realized that he was still facebook friends with her.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nWe talked a lot about this and he said he was just so unhappy at work at the time and unhappy with our relationship (news to me??!) because we didn't live together that he was vulnerable to attention from a beautiful woman.  He said it never became physical but they were very emotionally entangled at the time for many months. I had no idea at all.  He said together they decided the best thing was for her to accept another job offer (which he helped her get).\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nHe's very remorseful sometimes. Other times he will tell me that it's partially my fault because I rarely stayed over (I don't think that's true at all -- in fact I was the only one working on us -- he was so busy at work that I carried most of the relationship at that time).  I was doing everything for him to help him out because I knew how busy he was and how stressful life was for him back then.  He will also try to tell me I was too cold (again, he didn't bother mentioning that to me then).\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nI've tried to move past this. I told him he needed to delete her from facebook, and he did. It's been over a year since I found out but I still feel so much hurt and anger if I think about it, or if something triggers me (even something as stupid as a movie where the man is hooking up with his secretary).\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nIt's been over a year of anger, fighting, hurt and drama. The man I thought I was with is not the guy who would speak to his married secretary like that.  Should I just give up? I'm tired of feeling this way.\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n*TLDR. after I moved in I found out the year prior my boyfriend had some kind of relationship with his secretary and I think it has forever changed our relationship.*",

            "Sometimes you just can't get over something. You gave it more than a fair shot by staying a full year. You don't trust him, he doesn't really seem to acknowledge what he did and that it was his fault, you're just miserable... Time to move on.",
            ">He's very remorseful sometimes. Other times he will tell me that it's partially my fault \n\nIf he *ever* tries to blame you for his cheating, he's not remorseful. He may regret that you uncovered his affair but he's not remorseful.\n\nHe was cheating on you because he has poor boundaries and he will cheat again because he's never faced up to his fault in crossing boundaries with someone else.   He's had a year to show you that he understands what he did any yet still wants to claim that he wasn't really responsible.\n\nThere is no future in a relationship with someone who doesn't take responsibility for hurting you and who is not actively trying to rebuild your trust (which by the way takes at least 2 years when the cheater is doing every he can).  You need to end this no-win relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Comments so far have covered a lot of the important ground. If and when you break up with him, it's important to remember that he willfully engaged in behavior he had to know at the time was wrong, hid this from you, and attempted to avoid responsibility when discovered, even shoving some of that responsibility onto you, dredging up whatever he was not happy with you about as ways to justify his behavior. (Also, \"vulnerable\" to a beautiful woman? The word puts him in the role of a victim.) An important question to ask yourself is, if a similar situation arose in the future, would he do the same thing again? Since he hasn't taken full and unconditional responsibility for his actions, it seems likely the answer is yes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease keep in mind that if you break up with him, he's likely to react in a very hostile manner, with even more justifications for his past behavior and more blaming you. You need to stand your ground and not let him start a new discussion whose purpose is to convince you that what you're doing is unreasonable. By way of explanation, it would be best to keep it short and simple, something like \"I've tried my best to get past this, but I can't, and I've realized that this is not a relationship I can be in.\" I would suggest not reminding him of what he did, or getting into the emotional difficulties of the past year. He'll ask \"why?\", probably repeatedly, but it'll be an attempt to make you justify your actions; after all, it's not as though he doesn't know that this has been a huge issue. ",
            "He's blaming you for his behavior.\n\nDo not accept this.",
            "If it's been over a year since you found out about the emotional affair and the feelings you have about it are still this raw it's definitely time to move on from this relationship.",

            "Of course this changed your relationship. He's not taking responsibility for what he did, he never communicated his unhappiness in the relationship to you - instead turning to another woman to fulfill his needs of living in a perfect fantasy - and he betrayed you. He would definitely do it again.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it's physical. He was finding his romantic needs met from someone else. That still qualifies as cheating in my book.\n\nLeave him. You do not need this bullshit from this less than mediocre man. You do not have to forgive and heal from the shit he did. You deserve so much more.",
            "Regardless of anything else, wanting out of a relationship is a perfectly adequate and reasonable reason to end a relationship.",
            "Of course you\u2019re struggling to move past this. You\u2019ve learned that when he is unhappy with the relationship, he won\u2019t tell you and instead will find someone else to date behind your back. The goal of dating is to determine if someone is a viable life partner. It\u2019s up to you whether or not that\u2019s an acceptable flaw in your life partner, but for me it wouldn\u2019t be. ",

He's basically saying that because he wasn't getting what he felt was enough time with you, he replaced you with another woman part of the time and called it even. Tell him to get lost.",
            "My 2 cents:  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour feelings are valid - your instincts are there for a reason. It doesn't matter what anybody else has to say, if you can't get past it, there's a reason. Trust your gut.  If your gut says go, then go. This might be the first red flag you've consciously processed, but subconsciously, this might just be the last straw. ",

What next - your kid was sick so I wasn't getting enough attention so I cheated??!! Red flag. Get out, he has secret affairs and blames you when caught. You and your child deserve better. ",
            "He knew it was cheating, or else he wouldn't have hid their true relationship from you. He told her he loved her, FFS!\n\nIf he thought you were cold, or he wasn't getting the attention he wanted (bullshit), he should have used his words like an adult and communicated that to you so you could work on it together. That is not an excuse for the cheating. So what, if you're away for the weekend or sick, that's a free pass for him to cheat again? How does that make sense?\n\nHe was so busy with work, so you took on extra work to help him out, what a nice partner you are. But why was he at work so much? Because he was having an affair. And he let you think he's just so overworked and took advantage of your kindness. That is vile. \n\nLastly, I don't believe he didn't physically cheat, sorry. He's lied so much at this point, what makes you think that part is the truth? \n\nYou both have children. This man has destroyed the trust in your relationship. I would say there's nothing left there for you to save. ",

If they are saying \u201cI love you\u201d then there is no way it was not physical. Don\u2019t be as naive as I was. You cannot believe anything he says. Not a damn thing. \n\n\nAnd, if you don\u2019t leave him now, you will absolutely regret it later. ",

            "I think it's irrelevant whether he's remorseful, or what was in his heart at the time. At the end of the day, if you can't move on from his fuck up, the relationship is done. It sucks, but it's not your fault, and it's not within your control to change. Maybe if he had immediately fessed up and been truly sorry you would have been able to forgive him; maybe not. At this point there's obviously no way to know. The only thing that's certain is that you aren't going to get past this. You should move on. ",

That, mixed with him deciding to try to put the blame on you, is recipe for disaster. I would have a good long hard think about whether you are willing to try to leave the past in the past. \n\nI only speak from my own experience- but when you can\u2019t let go of the past it creates a toxic future.

            "His cheating was because of his lack of communication with you. While he was having this emotional affair; how many times did he ever say to you: \u201cI\u2019m not happy with how our relationship is progressing. I\u2019m emotionally entangled with my coworker. How do we fix this?\u201d\n\nMy guess is zero times. If he ever tries blaming you for his cheating, you need to tell him that he failed to communicate with you. He\u2019s an adult.

And that\u2019s also why you have to leave. It will get worse. \n\nDon\u2019t let yourself waste away for a man.",
            "Cheating doesn't magically heal over time with a few apologies. You need to do work on it. The fact that he didn't get therapy to fix what was wrong with him that allowed him to justify cheating on you, and you didn't get therapy to heal your broken trust & betrayal means that despite your best efforts this terrible wound has been festering for a year.\n\nIf you want to give it one last shot at fixing, then he needs to read a book called \"How to Help Your Spouse Heal from Your Affair: A Compact Manual for the Unfaithful\" by Linda J. MacDonald - fixing this is going to take way more than him being remorseful and saying sorry. He needs to get into individual therapy, and after he's been doing that for about 3 months, you two need couples therapy.\n\nIt takes on average 3 to 5 years of WORK and therapy to heal from cheating. And make no mistake what he did was cheating, even if they didn't get physical. \n\nIf you're done, then it's ok to be done. You don't owe him time or space to fix this, and if there's a chance of fixing it he needs to be really willing to do the therapy work. If he's not willing to do that, then eventually this will happen again. If he was able to justify doing this in the first year of your relationship just because you weren't physically around him the majority of the time after work, then he will find another lame ass excuse to do it again in future if he doesn't fix himself. Cheating is habit forming and even addicting, if he was able to use it as a quick fix for a need he had instead of working through that with you, he can do it again.\n\nWishing you the best.",

            "Unless you guys go to counseling to work this out, you should probably move on. You want him to validate your feelings -- which most people who are wronged want and is essential to healing and moving forward -- but he's not capable of that. He hasn't accepted responsibility for his actions because he still blames you for his affair. People who are able to justify their bad behavior like that do not have integrity. \n\nIt's been a year and you're still not over it, which means you're not going to just magically get over it without a lot of work on his part.

She was pressed against him so hard it looked like she was trying to pop balloons with her crotch. I was very hurt, but that\u2019s not all.

If you are unhappy with your significant other in your relationship, you SHOULD be faced with only two options, 1. Talk to them and work it out. 2. Leave. Not cheat. In my eye, emotional cheating is just as bad (if not worse) then physical cheating. Because you are allowing someone else in your heart. Your allowing yourself to be distracted from the person who your supposed to be committed too, your pulling from them to give to someone else. Your building a bond with someone else. Your growing emotionally attached to someone else instead of working on the foundation you have already build with your other half. At least sex is (a lot of the time) just sex. It\u2019s still not right by ANY means.

Try couples counseling, individual counseling, ect. But if in the end you just cannot find it in your heart to forgive him, you owe it to both him and yourself to let this relationship go.

Yes at time he blames you that is wrong but he is a human being and sometimes they say wrong things or just don\u2019t like taking blame. He also never got physical with her which IMO says a lot.  As for leaving him that is your call but the man made a mistake and did his best to correct it. I can fault him and say it was bad from him to do but he did his best to make his mistake.

The relationship you thought you had with him, was a lie.  He was too busy hiding another relationship that he ignored the one with you.  Instead of coming to you with his concerns and needs, he went elsewhere.  That is a problem.  You cannot trust him because he lied and feels you are to blame for his lying and cheating.  I say, you are right to want to move on and have a better life and even find a healthier relationship.",
            "The essential question is whether you can let go of these negative feelings. If that is not possible for you then it is best to move on. Only you can be the judge of that.\nOn the other side my advice would be to look at the feelings you still have for him. If there is affection left that should the basis to forgive and let go.\n\nForgiveness is not a popular word in this subreddit but is a fundamental aspect of love. And I don't care that my view on things may be out of the ordinary, what matters to me is if it can help you in some way to make the choice that is right for you.\nWe are all not perfect. No one in this world can actually fulfill al the needs their partner has. There is always something someone else has that your partner doesn't. So a loving relationship is also about accepting and tolerating each other imperfections.\n\nIf you decide to give it another chance then invest in better communication. Your boyfriend should learn to express in a good way what he is not happy about. That will prevent him to run as a dissatified child to someone else. Not an easy thing for a man to do BTW :) \n\nAnd he should also show his apprecation for how you are handling his emotional betrayal to you. You stuck by him till now and he should show you that in loving actions. And besides that invest in spending more quality time together. Good luck, wishing you the insight to make the  decision that is right for you. ",

You can't be vulnerable to a beautiful person. It doesn't work that way. If you are a good person who loves their partner, you will get over the fact you find someone attractive and act accordingly. Additionally, the fact he tells you this is partially your fault is pathetic. You did not push him into this. As I said before, this was a willful act. Sometimes, if the love is really there and the person who cheats is truly remorseful, you might be able to get past it, but in this case, I wouldn't say so. You deserve someone who won't throw stones when they're in the wrong. I'm so sorry this has happened to you. I wish you best in the future.

            "I understand the feeling. My now boyfriend of four years slept with my roommate and really close friend while when we started seeing each other, but were not exclusive yet. I confronted them both about it, forgave them both (although if I\u2019m honest, I never truly forgave friend), and eventually he and I became exclusive, moved to a different area together, live together... it took me a long time to be able to fully trust him again. My heart broke over it in different ways as our relationship evolved. As I fell more in love with him, thinking back to that time would hurt me in a way it didn\u2019t before. Now, over four years later I can say I don\u2019t think about it that often and it doesn\u2019t really hurt me any more. He\u2019s let me talk about it over and over and be angry over and over about it. But getting over that feeling of betrayal from before we were even technically together was extremely tough. It\u2019s not the forgiveness that is hard, it is remembering the hurt and dealing with that heartbreak over and over. ",

It doesn't have to be someone's fault for you to want it to be over.  Once trust is violated, if you can't get it back then it's hard to build a solid foundation for a long-term relationship.  Be grateful you aren't married and that it will be a \"clean\" break without entanglements.\n\nI frankly think he has handled the situation reasonably well.  Hear me out, not *perfectly* but hey, he has a work friend, they got to be very close, then they crossed the line of being too emotionally intimate, they both realize this and arrange to remove themselves from the situation before it gets out of hand, he shows remorse, he takes a year's worth of emotional weight from you about it.  What else can he do?  He let his \"work wife\" relationship get a little to close for comfort, he cut it off, got her transferred, and apologized to you about it.  Either let the guy off the mat or let him go for your own good.\n\nNone of this means you owe him forgiveness or a second chance or a relationship of any kind.  I think you guys should break-up for BOTH of your sakes.  The last thing you need is to be looking over your shoulder forever, unable to watch romantic comedies together. Sometimes relationships don't recover from a mistake, and in my opinion, this one shouldn't.  You both deserve better.",

I would still research and see what that baby of hers looks like...\n\nBecause I think it\u2019s very likely that your boyfriend is the father of her baby. \n\nAnd perhaps that\u2019s why she moved away. She can\u2019t stand her child growing up around a father that can\u2019t acknowledge him/her. Idk. \n\nJust a theory, but my Ne intuition was blaring ...

It\u2019s been 2 years and I still have \u201cflashbacks\u201d (for lack of a better word) and there are days where I still get angry and hurt over dumb things. I still have trouble trusting him after 2 years, and every time something feels off, I spiral into a panic thinking it might be happening again.\n\nIF you decide to work it out, I highly suggest couples counseling, and counseling alone, both of you. One thing that helped us is he opened all of his private accounts, and he was completely honest about everything that happened. We both had to put in a lot of work, and even then our relationship took a huge hit.\n\nThere is no shame in walking away, but if you truly love him, and you really want things to work out, then try. If not, don\u2019t waste anymore of your time. Don\u2019t put work into something you don\u2019t think is worth it.\n\nI hope you figure it all out, and I hope whichever way you decide to go, you\u2019re absolutely, disgustingly happy. ",

It was a rocky time for us and we spent a good bit of time apart from each other, SO contemplating our relationship and me going to therapy and fixing myself. Why did I feel the need to talk to someone else when we argued? Anyway, short version therapy helped ALOT, and our relationship has a completely different dynamic now. However, this happened in a span of three months. It\u2019s really up to you what happens from here, but if it were me I\u2019d strongly consider leaving.

Everyone is vulnerable to having an affair; especially those who would disagree with this statement the most because they think it could or would never happen to them while they blindly ignore their own human condition. If your own needs are not being met in this relationship, then (by all means) move on; but if you still love the man, then learn from the experience. Whether you decide to stay or go, make an effort to forgive him, yourself, the secretary, and the circumstances.

What's absolutely fine!\nBut still not enough for random guys on internet to tell you what to do.\n\n\nHow long was he single, before he met you, before he decided to be together in an relationship with you?!\nDid you both were 100% sure (especially he) that you are a couple to that time?!\nWhy do I ask that.\nSome men have problems to get engaged, especially when it's close after a breakup.\nSince you wrote he have a kid to, so maybe he's not single for that long time?\nOften men in this position are hopeless.\nEmotionally wounded. They searching for warmes, Care, \"Love\".\nThey often feel lost and alone.\nYou wrote, that you took that new relationship with him slowly. Maybe it was at that time to slow for him?!\nMaybe he was \"searching\" for love.\nFor a warm feeling. And this kinda match what he told you \"you were so cold\".\nI don't blame you or him. I just try to be objective.\nThings are never black or white, most of the time they are grey or extremely colorful but we don't see that.....\n\nI'm a real empathy guy.\nI always try to BE my opposite person in front of me.\nTry to understand why people do, think and react like they do. Many think I can read minds but I can't...\nIt's just an automatism in my being.\n\nYou are the only one who can tell yourself, can I come over it. Is it worth fighting for or not.\n\n\n\nBut, if you still want to give it a chance, try to see that time from another perspective.\nI don't know how long you know each other.\nAnd how good and TRULY open you two were able to talk from day one.\nI would say, since your story tells me you did it slowly and he fell somehow for the secretary, you did not reach that level of real talk to that time.\n\nIf I understand it right, it was the starting time of your relationship.\nThink about that. What if, if that's true that he just really wanted to be loved. To really feel that.\nWhat if, when it's true that you were cold to him?!\nJust in his point of view, this does not mean that's true! Everything in life is subjective...\nIf you can't go one step back to overview it from another position...\n\nWhat I try to tell you, if this would happen at the mid of a relationship this is a whole other story.\nBut if something like that happens at start, this is different.\nMaybe he just wasn't that committed to the relationship at that point like you was.\nMaybe he searched and needed more to that time, what you wasn't able to give him, or he just did not see it.\n\n\nIf it's really true that there wasn't anything physical, which doesn't makes it better at all!\nAnd that they ended it, and he decided to choose you, that means a lot too btw.\n\nI mean, that doesn't help you at all, I know.\nBut maybe it lets you rethink some things.\nAnd helps you to get a decision.\n\n\n\nOne important thing I have to say still:\nTrust is like a paper, if you \"crumple\" it, it will never be as smooth as it was before.\n\nThe only thing what can help to get over it is, to understand or realize that things to that time point were different like you felt it at that times.\nYes that hurts. But that means something else too.\nHe decided to choose you.\n\nIf you want to fighting for, you have to look at him now. Is he loving you.\nDo you feel it?\nIs he showing it to you?\n\nMaybe let him read my post...\nAsk him. Talk about it open and free.\nMaybe there are a lot of unspoken things (I'm sure there is)...\n\n\nI wish you both good luck in life.\nAnd a lot of strength. Alone or together.\n\nFirst of all, you have to care for yourself!\nYou have to see that you are fine.\nWe, the Reddit guys can't show you the way.\nAnd we shouldn't dare to tell you what to do.\n\nI just wanted to tell you.\nGet other perspectives.\nLife is colorful. Many things are unspoken.\nI hope this will help you to find your way.\n\n\n\nSry for my bad english I'm not a native english tongue though.\n\n\nMuch love and strength from Germany.\nBenjamin",
            "To be fair, you have every right to be bitter and resentful to the behavior, but to be stuck in the feeling and feel it towards yourself and partner is counter-productive to what a healthy and happy relationship should actually contribute to your well-being... There is no justification for a married individual and an individual in a committed relationship (with kids involved in the mix) to commit to an emotional love affair for consecutive months at a time, and then helping to progress the financial/career status as a farewell present to the (supposed) sexless participant. The entire relationship can be described as verbal foreplay and warrants a cheating pin of dishonor. That's unethical in a work environment (especially if he was specifically her upline in MGMT), sleazy to the partners that got played,if only in a non-confirmable 'sexless' agreement, and it's  irresponsible to the kids of the family brought together before the affair began. I would be concerned with previous secretaries and future secretaries and possible escalated events and STDs. May sound a tad dramatic, but if he lied about a daily 'verbal/emotional' affair, for months at a time, what else is he capable of lieing about with a straight face and a separate home to house a sexual affair in... It was admirable to give the guy a second chance, but if he doesn't take %100 responsibility for his own actions and words then his apology is pretty much worthless (it would be to me anyway), and you're only wasting time that could be better spent on other things than being stuck in resentment and bitterness... There's no shame in calling it quits after something like this and moving on for the better...",

Have you worked through the damaged trust?\n\n3. Have you worked through what caused him to seek attention from another women? \n\n4. Have you repaired the damage? \n\n5. Have you allowed time for healing? \n\nThese are only  five questions. There is a enormous amount of work to be done to repair what was damaged and then when that damage is repaired to go back and build the foundation that was lacking which led to the affair. Everyone has told the OP that this isn\u2019t her fault (it isn\u2019t) and that she should decide to move on or forgive (both over simplify the problem). There is a fissure in the foundation of your relationship and the affair is a symptom of this fissure. The OP has to decide if this man is worth fixing the symptom so that they can both fill in the fissure. \n\nRelationships are hard work. The easy part is deciding the person across from us is who we want to work hard with. ",

        "selftext": "Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3mdqv6/me_28_f_with_my_bf_29_m_of_3_years_his_parents/\n\n\nI read all the replies and I had a long talk with my BF about boundaries. He listened, agreed with me, and decided to talk to his parents. I was hopeful and glad that he was going to do something about this, but things soon got much worse.\n\n\nHe returned home a few hours later with his parents! Silly me, I was assuming that they were here to apologize or at the very least have an adult conversation about everything that has been going on. \n\n\n1. They accused me of trying to keep him away from them and isolate him in order to abuse and control him. I told them that I was not, and never said that he shouldn't interact with them. All I wanted was for them to respect MY boundaries and stop making unreasonable demands. They said that this is what all abusers do, and that I am showing my true colors. The messed up part is that my BF was visibly affected by all this to the point of starting to agree with them!\n\n2. They kept insisting that I was acting guilty, and that only guilty people have something to hide, and the fact that I'm refusing to show them my bank statements prove that their suspicions are correct. I told them that it is NONE of their business, and if my BF trusts me, what right do they have to interfere with my business? At that point his dad got in my face and screamed at me about being a horrible person who abuses their son.\n\n3. They brought up a music festival I had attended last year with mutual friends of BF and I from college. They accused me of spending that weekend away prostituting myself instead of going to the festival, and when I countered with the fact that there was an entire album full of photos on my FB, they then changed their accusation to suspecting that I was dealing drugs! This was shocking to me as I have never dealt drugs in my life, and neither my BF, his parents, or anyone else has ever accused me of dealing drugs. I pointed out that their accusations keep changing the moment the first one is proven wrong, and how exactly am I supposed to prove a negative like that? Even if I gave them my bank statements, they would accuse me of having a different account, or of hiding cash, who knows what else? I told them that it is clear that it isn't going to stop, and therefore they should just stop bothering me with their insane theories and leave me alone. I guess this was my fault for going to the festival without my BF, but I had asked him to go along repeatedly but he kept saying that he doesn't like large crowds, which I have known about him from the start. I didn't think that there was an issue since I was camping with girls and my BF also knew these people from college. \n\n4. My BF then said that it could be a possibility that I was actually dealing drugs, that my refusal and anger at his parents' requests is making him no longer trust me and that he is starting to think \"where there is smoke there is fire.\" WHAT. THE. HELL. I told him that he had never once accused me of prostitution or drug dealing before and these insane accusations only started once his parents put the idea into his head! If he was uncomfortable with me going to the festival, he could have spoken up before I bought the ticket, before I actually left, and if he was uncomfortable he could also have brought it up in the YEAR since then and now, but he didn't, and only started getting uncomfortable once his parents planted these ideas into his head.\n\n5. I told them that I don't understand where these suspicions are coming from. I make a normal amount of money for someone in my position, I live below my means, I don't make any extravagant purchases, so why exactly do they accuse me of hiding so much money? What money? They then said that I am \"deflecting\" in order to not have to answer their accusations, that I had manipulated my BF into sticking up for me, and that the camping trip showed them how much I was abusing my BF, that their poor son has been so abused that he would deny that I was slapping him.\n\n\nMy BF said that since this conflict doesn't seem to be getting resolved, and since they are his parents after all and that he can't be with someone that refuses to get along with his parents, we are breaking up. Seriously. Those were his words. I am apparently the bad one in everything here and his delusional evil parents are not at fault. His parents helped him pack up and he went home with them.\n\n\nHis parents then said that they are going to call the cops on me for domestic violence and drug dealing. I am innocent, but I don't know what is going to happen now, if their insane calls to the cops are going to jeopardize my job in some way. I am so scared of these insane people and what they may end up doing. :(\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: They are all batshit insane and are seriously in need of psychiatric help.",

If you do, it might be worthwhile to consult with a lawyer, free legal counsel, or a domestic violence shelter (I added them because they probably have dealt with this situation). Good luck.",

To get one, you make a written statement as to why you need it so that will be documented.

            "I know it hurts, but honestly, lucky escape. \n\nHe's past old enough to have his shit together.  Part of being ready for a mature relationship is leaving the nest and taking responsibility for your own life. Your BF is clearly not there, and if his parents have their way, he never will. It's tragic for him, he won't have a shot of life until he grows up and escapes (unlikely), or they die. I don't know if you've ever seen a helicopter child when the parents that made of their decisions and 'handled' things dies - it's not pretty. They are doing him a terrible disservice, creating a socially stunted mini-me who has lost his youth to being an extension of them. But it's a tragedy he's chosen, and at this point you need to let him go and save yourself. \n\nHis parents are insane and abusive. That won't change. I expect his next \"girlfriend\" will be someone they introduce him to, who will allow herself to be completely subsumed by them. They are so toxic - they're like a cheater who thinks everyone cheats. It does seem like they're guilty of at least some of the behavior they accuse you of. I have to wonder what else is going on it that house. \n\nI also expect you'll hear from him. He won't be happy, you were right, etc. etc. - but not 'right' enough for him to go no contact with his parents, or fix his shit. If you feel like he has an emotional pull on you that makes you even consider taking him back under any other circumstance, go no contact. \n\n\nNow that you're broken up, if they actually go through with calling the police or contacting your work I would be concerned. They have no reason to continue harassing you unless they are obsessed - not just with saving their son, but destroying you.  Lawyer, TRO, etc. Document every communication you had with them. \n\nAs my grandmother said, \"Education doesn't come cheap. You pay in money or you pay in tears.\" It's time to move the tassel of your relationship mortarboard to the left; three years isn't bad for an advance degree. Mazel Tov!",

You would not be happy in the long term with him.\n\nConsider yourself lucky that he ended it.\n\nAs for his parent's threats, you can wait until they actually contact the police or you can contact a lawyer now.

They wanted to know how much you spent on pizza, too? And if you were in fact a drug dealer or a prostitute wouldn't you be smart enough not to deposit huge lump sums into one bank account? No, they just had one goal - to get you far away from their son. He's a total goner, there's no hope for him and it's just a shame. But you two weren't married, did not have kids, and that's a huge huge huge relief. \n\nI truly doubt they're going to call the cops on you - they were probably saying that in front of your loser ex so that they'd have more credibility. Honestly, a cop will take both your versions of the story, might investigate, will find no proof to their claims and will call it a day. \n\nI doubt they'd call your job again and try to humiliate you publicly, they probably just wanted you out of their son's life.

Lawyers, documents, your job (which you mentioned contacting so that's good), your friends as well (if you have any mutual friends you may want to contact them or figure out who you need to cut ties with. LET THE PURGE COMMENCE!). Head to /r/legaladvice just to get yourself started. If you share anything (names on the apartment lease, bills, etc.) contact the property manager/company and tell them the situation.

Again /r/legaladvice will have more on that.  \n\nSeriously though, these next couple of days, weeks, maybe months? are going to suck.

It just seems such an improbable explanation of these events. Instead, I suspect that your boyfriend was unhappy in the relationship and has been complaining to them for a long time. His complaints grew more and more insistent until they snapped and jumped in to save him from you. He is definitely spineless. He may have wanted them to force the relationship to end so he wouldn't have to be the bad guy. You will never know, they aren't going to tell you what he's been saying behind your back. But, this fits with the evidence you provided better than that all 3 of them just lost their grip on reality. I'm not saying they aren't wrong for butting in, they are.

Pretty much what everyone suggested would happen, we broke up. It wasn't nice though.\n\nHonestly, I've been kind of regretting the threesome because more and more I feel like I was strongly manipulated; lead into believing it would be just no-strings fun whereas it was actually a vehicle for her to have sex with another guy.\n\nI sat her down and said to her clearly, I've been thinking about her proposition, and she can have sex with the guy if she tells me who it is, and she has to be honest about if she had this person in mind from the start when she suggested it.\n\nShe became ecstatic to hear about this, and told me the person was \"Adam.\"  I know \"Adam\", I've met him a few times, he works at the same place she does.\n\n\"I thought Adam is married\" I said\n\n\"He is, but he and his wife are swingers\" she tells me.\n\nI then tell her \"like I said, you are free to have sex with Adam as much as you want, but our relationship is over.\"\n\nShe then freaked out at what I said as she slowly realised I was serious and was ending the relationship out of the blue, she wasn't expecting it at all.  At first she thought I was kidding, then she became really angry at me and started shouting and going crazy.  She said all sorts of nasty things and told me I lied to her, deceived her, etc. because I had sex with another woman but won't let her have sex with another man.\n\nI told her she's free to have sex with him now, because our relationship is over, and I don't want to be in a relationship with a woman who very clearly lusts after another man.\n\nI then said to her something along these lines \"I feel like you manipulated me when you suggested the threesome; you said you just wanted to experiment but you were really trying to use it as leverage so you could have sex with another man.  If I had known that was your ulterior motive, I never would have agreed to it. What you did was dishonest and manipulative.\"\n\nOf course, she wasn't too happy to hear this.  There was much tears and anguish from her part, but she accepted it eventually.  I started getting texts the next day from her, she was apologising profusely, saying she was sorry, she didn't want to sleep with another man, she regrets suggesting the threesome, and she just wants to continue her relationship with me.\n\nI said to her something about us being \"sexual incompatible\", but honestly I felt like I was just giving her a bullshit excuse. The real reason was that I didn't want a woman that so desperately wanted to have sex with another guy, that she would even manipulate me towards that goal.\n\nI keep getting more texts from her and missed calls, angry ones, apologetic ones, crying ones, and furious ones.  Since she didn't seem to get the message that we're through, I'm just ignoring her now.  Honestly, I'm really happy with my decision, no regrets. I feel like I've let go of some negative baggage, and I'm already excited about moving on with my life and pursuing future relationships.\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: We broke up.",

            "It sounds like you made the right choice.  It really seems like your girlfriend's endgame was to be able to sleep with this Adam guy.  \n\nOn that note, I've yet to hear of a threesome that went well on r/relationships (although, you probably wouldn't post here if it went right).  \n\nEdit:  Thanks to everyone who is responding with positive threesome/poly experiences!  It's really awesome to hear good stories on r/relationships and get insight into how communication and trust can really help couples open up to one another and explore new experiences.",

            "Given that Adam and his wife are swingers, I have no idea why the question wasn't about swinging with Adam and his wife instead of gf asking just to fuck Adam, especially because a lot of swingers don't play without their spouse. This tells me that there's probably something else going on here.",
            "This whole thread seems like a fight between people who seem like they feel the need to defend open relationships and people who are judging her as manipulative.\n\nThere is no universal law to this stuff. If someone wants to break up with someone because their partner suggested they have sex with someone else, more power to them. If they want to allow a specific sex into the bedroom and not another, more power to them. You people trying to dictate that op needs to accept men if he accepts women are trying to force your personal views on other people's relationship. There are all kinds of people in this world. OP wasn't down for what his partner asked for, to the point he felt offended and manipulated, and he very much has a right to feel that way. No one here has a right to take away his choice in his own relationships just because it doesn't match some ideal you want to impose on everyone else.",
            "It just really sucks that she didn't have the guts to just say \"I want to experience a threesome with you that involves another guy\". She went to really great lengths to try to \"get\" you to be ok with that. If she would have just been upfront and honest maybe things could have been handled differently.",
            "Op has made his decision, and relationships are voluntary, so I'm not going to address that. However, many of you are missing that, even with just the MMF suggestion, the FFM and MMF are *not* equivalent. How so? Because *she's* picked the third party in both situations. The female is an acquaintance the OP doesn't mention being particularly attracted to. The stepping out from monogamy is purely physical, and there's no emotional risk. But the male? He's someone she has a definite attraction to. She gets both physical and emotional needs met by someone outside the relationship, and there's a high likelihood that she was, consciously or unconciously, hoping for it to continue because of her attraction to Adam.\n\nAnd I think OP recognized that. She wasn't just looking for a fun physical outlet, she was looking for a sanctioned affair, and trading a one-time experience for it. She may have rationalized it to herself as a trade of supposedly equal experiences, but they really weren't, and  that wasn't her motivation.\n",
            "All of you people claiming he is a hypocrite or anything similar are clearly biased and pushing your own agenda in this situation. This is a place for relationship advice not forcing your personal narrative. You judge the information impartially and then give the best advice given the perspective of the person asking for it.\n\nHe clearly was not ok with the MMF and it seems very likely she was manipulating him the entire time in order to fuck another guy \"legally.\" Even if that is not the case, and she was just interested in exploring her sexuality her partner was not ok with her fucking another guy. So he broke up with her because she clearly has that desire. \n\nI see a lot of talking about sexual compatibility on reddit but it seems you only care about the feelings of the female here and don't consider that a man could ever be incompatible with a woman that wants to explore sexual encounters that he is not comfortable with.\n\nBasically what I am saying is that you are all the hypocrites here, he did exactly what he should have done because they were no longer sexually compatible. It would be impossible to trust that she wouldn't pursue these desires in the future without his knowledge.  \n\n ",

            ">  I've been thinking about her proposition, and she can have sex with the guy if she tells me who it is, and she has to be honest about if she had this person in mind from the start when she suggested it.\n\nYou told her that? And then broke up with her after telling her you just need her to be honest? That rubs me the wrong way. ",
            "Forgetting about the three way and Adam it seems you are happy to be out of the relationship with her.\nI think it was heading that way before this all took place.  Maybe you didn't want to face that fact or let go.\n\nTell her it is over and be done.",
            "Man, people are giving you shit for how you decided to sit down and talk to her (saying you were just as manipulative as her, etc), and I seriously can't believe it.\n\nOP's girlfriend did a really shitty thing. Reddit has this stupid circlejerk about always being the better person, but that isn't how real life works. Sometimes people want to retaliate *because that's human nature*. OP wasn't even a huge dick about it, he was just giving her a taste of her own medicine. It sucks to see people say things like \"Glad you're out of the relationship, but you handled this poorly\"- I feel like that kind of shit will undermine his confidence to do what's best for himself in the future.\n\nAnyways, OP, you handled it way more mature than I would, that's for sure, and I'm glad to hear you're really happy. You are awesome.",

Those intentions left him with the decision to break up with her.\n\nThe way it came out was definitely harsh but being desperate enough to get OP into a threesome just so she had the chance to sleep with another guy she has had eyes for is far worse.

But this line:\n\n>I don't want to be in a relationship with a woman who very clearly lusts after another man.\n\nmakes it sound like you want someone who ONLY wants you EVER. And that I think is a pretty unrealistic expectation. People are attracted to other people. It's human, nothing you can do to stop it. Yes, she should have absolutely been honest when she brought up the threesome, that she was expecting to get her jollies in too afterwards. That was shitty of her to do. But did you two ever have a serious, sit down conversation where you brought up all of your thoughts on this? It really sounds like you assumed she did the threesome just for this reason, and broke up with her in your head before you even talked with her about it. Basically, I think it's inevitable that people in long term relationships will develop crushes on other people, but it's your *actions*, not your thoughts, that we judge people by. And in this case (we assume) she had yet to act on that. She was being selfish and naive by complaining that you wouldn't just go along with it, but I, at least, don't think the situation was unsalvageable. But if you're happy with the decision, good for you and hope you've at least learned something from all this",

That is fucking shitty and  you sound like an asshole. \n\nI think you had every right to break up with her if you weren't game for the proposition or were offended by it, but you should have just fucking owned it. You manipulated her and then pulled out the rug. \n\nNo matter what bullshit you sling about the first threesome being for \"both of you\", you happily agreed to it instead of saying then that you didn't want to bring other people into your relationship. \n\nNext time, be a fucking man/decent person about it. \n\nI definitely think it was good riddance in this situation, and I hope your ex-girlfriend finds someone way more awesome, sexually open and decent than you.

I've had a disability for about three years. \n\nI recently found out three members have tried to convince my fiance to leave me on multiple occasions, purely due to my disability. They basically said they don't see the point of staying with a disabled person and they want him to be happy. He assured them each time he is happy and it is his choice to stay with me. \n\nThey are all acting as though it is normal that they would try to convince him to leave, and that I'm overreacting by being upset. They've also stated they wanted \"what was best for both of us\" which I think was pretty obviously not true.\n\nI'm just trying to get some clarity here because I'm feeling very confused and worthless. I have myself given my fiance the option of leaving many times and said i wouldn't blame him, but he always said he wanted to stay.\n\nIs their behaviour normal? Is it OK for me to be upset?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nTl;dr : group members have tried to convince my partner to leave me due to my disability. Is that normal, and is it OK for me to feel upset.\n\nEdit: a lot of people seem to be interested in precisely what the disability is. As explained below it is rare enough that given the friends in question are redditors I think it would possibly stop the post being fully anonymous. To answer in depth questions: it is a physical disability, no it is not at all weight related, I am following all the medical guidelines possible regarding healing though not everything is known about this condition. Yes I am trying my best, no I am never abusive towards him, yes I am able to emotionally support him when he needs it. Yes he has to help me physically sometimes for example pushing my wheelchair and making the majority of meals. No it is not expected to get worse over time although nobody can know for sure. Yes he has to emotionally support me too when anxiety or grief about this condition get to me. Hopefully that now gives everyone enough information to go off.\n\nEdit 2: thank you for all the lovely validating replies. It is nice to know not everyone thinks about disability in the way they do.\n\nEdit 3: I was not expecting the scale of this response! I have spoken with my fiance and we have both agreed to get a lot of space from these people. Thank you all so much!",

It\u2019s just a part of my life. My SO loves me because we are perfect for each other and make each other happy. If he is sitting in the hospital OR recovery with me making me laugh or I am grilling him a steak dinner and we are contentedly watching Netflix, it all comes down to he is my favorite person in the world and I am his. His health and well-being are a priority for me, just like mine is for him. We are partners in taking care of each other. \n\nYour friends have no idea how fragile the human body is, but they\u2019ll find out in time. They\u2019re immature and hurtful.

            "I know how you feel, OP. I've been through it myself with people telling my husband to leave me because of my disability. Just because I got drastically sicker around the time of the wedding, which we knew would happen at some point but not so soon. We cut those people off hard and fast and told them exactly why. People think disabled people have no right to love and that we are inherently unworthy and incapable of affection, love, and relationships. I totally recommend you look up the hashtag #100outof100 on Twitter and Instagram. It's nice to know you aren't alone. It's hard to wrench free of internalized ableism (I'm nowhere near there yet!) and to see yourself as a person seperate from your disability and not just a burden when the world is telling you that's what you are. Your friends are shit and need to get in the fucking sea.\n\nFeel free to message me if you need someone to talk to \u2764\n\nEta: also, people here can fuck off with demanding to know details of exactly what your disability is. People think disabled people owe them a fucking medical history and life story to explain why they deserve to be called disabled. I'm guessing you're Aussie from you saying you're on the DSP, and I know how hard it is to be accepted for it- only about 29% of applicants are, and the process is one of the most stressful things I've ever gone through, even with a confirmed genetic disorder. So yeah, you don't owe anyone here an explanation, and the fact people here are demanding details in order to judge you shows how disgusting society is to disabled people.",
            "> They basically said they don't see the point of staying with a disabled person and they want him to be happy.  \n\nWow. I hope their respective partners know what they are letting themselves in for. \n\nSadly, I think their behaviour is normal in the sense that there are a lot of people around with negative views about disabled people. That doesn't make it right. \n\nI also think that there are some people who are incredibly controlling when it comes to their friends and want to tell everyone what to do and when. \n\nYes, I think it's understandable why you are upset. Why wouldn't you be? They are trying to sabotage your relationship.",

She had just gotten approved for disability in December and probably would have been on it for the rest of her life, \n\nSomeone asked me a few weeks ago if I ever felt like I was in a relationship with her disability rather than in a relationship with her. I told them not once did I ever feel that way.\n\nI loved her for who she was and how she made me feel. Her disability was just something we had to deal with. Plus, she took care of me just as much as I helped take care of her. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that those people are saying such horrible things. I know it\u2019s hard enough to not beat yourself up without those kind of toxic external influences.\n\nIt sounds like your partner really loves you and that you love them.

I can see people being concerned at the start of your disability to make sure he knows its okay if he cant handle it and has to leave, but not after hes been comfortable with your disability for the last three years. Obviously, he knows and understands your disability and its not a deal breaker to him. Those \"friends\" are just really shitty people.\n\nFWIW, Im another disabled person with an abled partner and we've been together for 9 years and counting. \n\nEdit: For those users saying you have to give more information on your disease, thats bull. Whether its weight related, pain related, movement restriction related, verbally related, etc. Your boyfriend has known about it and dealt with it with you for 3 years, and I would assume goes to your appointments with you or atleast knows enough about your disability that he understands it. That is all that matters. He knows about it, he understands, and he is ok with it. Not everyone sees disabilities as deal breakers.

None of our friends have told him that he should break up with me and he would tell them where to go if they did.",

Or were they always more your fiance's friends than yours? Not that that makes it right, but might explain some of the fickleness a bit better. (Noting that explanation /=/ validation. They're still very much in the wrong.) At  the very least, these are friends who can't really be there for the hard stuff. You need friends who can be there for the hard stuff.",

            "No one is a lesser person because they have a disability. As long as everyone is contributing what they can when they can, and everyone is happy with one another, the \"friends\" can mind their own business. I'm not sure if it's just malice, laziness or concern of your betrothed's long term well being. If he's aware of what that looks like long term than he's making an educated decision. \n\nIf I was your SO I would tell them why what they said sucks and I wouldn't be friends with them any longer. \n\nMy only question is why would he tell you?  I would never tell my SO something negative a friend said. For example, my ex-husband was 13 years my senior and wasn't the best looking, I was a fitness competitor and in excellent shape, the friend that commented on his looks and weight got cut out of my life and never said anything. Now his weight is something he could do about that, you can do nothing about your disability. Why would he tell you what these friends said? To me that is only hurtful. I value honesty and truth but sometimes very hurtful things do not need to be said.  Of course your post is very short, I don't want to assume, i don't think him bad for telling you, there could've been circumstances that lead to that conversation. \n\nI wish you all the best!

I\u2019m personally very insecure about people thinking I\u2019m less than because I\u2019m disabled, so this would be truly heartbreaking.

Except instead of it being my fiance\u2019s friends it was my fiance\u2019s mother. \n\nLike you, I also gave my SO other an out, but I respected him enough to make a decision and know the consequences. Some people can handle being with a disabled SO, some people cannot. All your friends are thinking about is how THEY couldn\u2019t cope, so obviously your fiance is just sacrificing himself. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything against you, they just cannot fathom your fiance not having the same deal breakers as them. I know how much it hurts for someone to say that about you but really I feel like its a projection of their own ignorance. \n\nYour fiance shut them down.

During bad attacks, she's catatonic or in a fugue state, during which she may vomit on or soil herself, pass out or collapse suddenly, and be partially or fully unconscious for 4-8 hours, or wracked with such significant spasms that she can't sleep. \n\nI've several times come home and had to carry her from the floor or the bed, strip her of soiled clothes, bathe her, redress her, change the sheets, put her to bed, and/or clean up her urine, feces, or vomit on the floor, and keep watch over her while she rests. I've several times had to aid her through changing out of vomit-soaked clothes, changing into clean ones, and cleaning up the mess in the car, kitchen, bathroom, whatever from the splatter of the projectile vomit. \n\nAnd then I sit and keep an active eye on her for hours.\n\nAnd it doesn't bother me in the slightest, besides my fear for her safety and well-being (Sometimes she'll collapse/fall unconscious from a standing position, and I worry about corners and counters).\n\nMy mom once told me that love is cleaning up someone else's shit (literally) and not minding.\n\nShe's the best thing that's ever happened to me. I couldn't possibly care less if that's part of the \"price\" of her being in my life. I love her, and I will care for her in sickness and in health. Having to wash vomit out of her hair or change her out of urine-soaked clothes doesn't change one single goddamn bit of that.\n\nI'd imagine that your fiance has a similarly intense set of emotions towards you.",

            "Yeah, you can be mad. These are not people who are coming to your fiance to check in and make sure he's making his own informed decision about the relationship (and even if they were, dude, a few years ago was probably the time for that.) They're not a therapist asking open ended questions about the future as a catalyst for him to understand and decide on his future. (Also, it sounds like you two have already done that\u2014good job.) Instead, they're coming to him because they don't agree with his decision, and they're trying to talk him out of it... because they think that your disability makes you less. A bad match. That this *one* life characteristic (out of many!) trumps the rest and means that the entire wonderful 8 year relationship you two have should be called off. Uh-oh, this one's broken, time to get a new one.\n\nAdd in the fact that your fiance has *already made and reaffirmed his decision to marry you many times over* and it just gets worse.\n\nIf you've read this sub, you've probably seen the advice that, for close friends in abusive relationships you don't agree with, you get *one time* to state your case before it starts hurting your relationship with the person. While I don't think disability is in any way comparable to abuse, I do think the same rule applies here. They're close friends worried about how your disability will affect you and your joint future? Okay, fine. If they are really bothered, I can see *one time* to kindly express their concerns, to ask about the plan and if you've considered X, Y or Z. But then you and fiance get to decide for yourselves how you want to live your lives, and when you make your decisions (as your fiance already has,) the comments period has closed and they need to accept it/let it go, even if they don't agree with it. They're not doing that. So not only are they being shitty about your disability, they also don't even respect you and fiance enough to accept his decisions.\n\nSo, yes, absolutely be upset.

They are leeches with a negativity bias. \n\nFor those wondering,  negativity bias is the idea that negativity begets negativity, even when applied on an equal playing field.  There's been many studies on this in social settings and from what I've seen,  been proven true.\n\nUnfortunately for you,  your fiance's positivity is far outmatched by your three \"friends\" negativity. Everyone's walls have limits and in this case,  your fiance is matching wits with three intensely negative people. \n\nSo what's happening? When we come up with an opinion, and someone agrees,  our brain releases dopamine and you emotionally and physically feel good.  When someone disagrees,  your brain triggers a feeling of pain.  You can see now that by disagreeing with his friends it's triggering a high level of \"pain\" which eggs the friends on to push even harder because three brains are looking for that release of dopamine they'll receive when your fiance agrees.  \n\nStatistically,  they won't stop.  Also statistically,  your fiance WILL crack eventually.  \n\nWhen you're in a relationship,  and this is my opinion, you have to protect it with everything you've got because so many things are trying to ruin it. One way of doing that is by clearing away anything possible that puts pressure on that relationship.  There are things you can't clear away and those you'll have to work through.  \n\nYour \"friends\" should be an easy decision to trash because it sounds like that's where they belong anyway.",
            "Here's a new take, have they specifically told you this themselves or has all the information filtered through your fiance? You said he's so wonderful and amazing but I just want to tell you that I thought my ex was wonderful and amazing and he treated me like a queen to my face but was cheating the entire time and slowly isolating me from my friends and family \n\nThis could totally not be the case with you but I would ask your friends some very blunt questions if all of the information has come through your fiance so far. Sometimes a narcissist will tell you that your friends are saying bad things about you so that you will cut off your friends. Covert narcissist can remain hidden for years and our sweet as pie to your face. Alternatively if your friends have actually said this to you or you have actually witnessed them saying these things, you may want to consider actually cutting off those specific friends but I just wanted to put it out there. My ex tried telling me that all of my friends thought I was weird and were just kind of putting up with me but were too afraid to say anything so I cut my friends off because at the time I still have not figured my ex out yet, so be aware",
            "OP, these three friends are ableist and no longer see you as a person in spite of knowing you before your disability. Whatever excuses they or other people might give, that is what it boils down to. It's no different than if your friends were doing the same thing because your fiance was White and you were Black, or if he were an American and you were a Muslim/from the Middle East, or if he were straight and you were transgender or bisexual. They're bigots who have dehumanized you.\n\nBefore the gas chambers were used to kill Jews, they were used on disabled adults *with the knowledge and blessing of the public*. A board of doctors would look at a disabled adult's chart--oftentimes without ever physically seeing that person--and if a majority ruled the populace was better off without the burden of them, they were sent to the showers.\n\nYour basic human rights are up for debate on the regular still. A lot of people are perfectly comfortable with eugenics against people with disabilities. A lot of people would be perfectly comfortable if people with disabilities would quietly go away (read: be exiled and die alone, be culled, be sterilized so they couldn't pass on their disabilities). A lot of healthy people don't give this a second thought. A lot of people who think they're progressive aren't bothered by this.\n\nYou are a person with basic human rights. You deserve life and love. You are not responsible for living your life, fighting and living alongside your illness, struggling with your own grief for your once able body, AND dealing with the ignorance and outright hatred that leads anybody in your life to encouraging you to go disappear.\n\nCut these \"friends\" out.

I deal with some mental issues and if my friends or my husband friends were saying we shouldn't be together because of what I deal with, we would not consider them friends anymore.

            "Oooooooh no, girl. Sounds like it's time to cut them off and find a better crowd. That is not healthy and certainly not normal. Having a disability does not mean your life is over and you are no longer deserving of good things.",

Something along the lines of:\n\n* You've already thought this through\n* You've already heard about this from X other well-meaning people\n* How would you feel if someone was trying to break up your relationship with the person you loved and wanted to share the rest of your life with?\n* Lastly but most importantly, you consider the matter to be closed and you won't be entertaining this topic of conversation anymore.",

            "OP, you've gotten a lot of great responses already but I wanted to chime in and let you know that you are not alone. I have a common but life-threatening food allergy and people my husband and I considered good friends tried to convince him that I am \"sucking the fun out of his life\" with all that entails.\n\nSo I want to validate your feelings - no, this behaviour is neither normal nor acceptable. Yes, it is ok for you to be upset. How does your fianc\u00e9 feel? I hope he is also upset. You both would be well within your rights to cut those people out of your lives, because they may be his friends (I suppose), but they are certainly not your friends or friends of your relationship.\n\nBe aware, though, that you may get some pushback from your other friends in the vein of \"but you guys have been friends for so long! Is it really that big a deal?!?!\" To which your response is, of course, yes. It is a huge deal. I personally went with \"[Husband] and I do not associate with people who try to sabotage our marriage,\" which put a stop to most of the pestering pretty quick.\n\nI'm sorry this is happening to you. I know how hurtful and upsetting it is. Your disability is not your fault and you certainly don't deserve to be betrayed by friends over it. I'm happy that you have found a wonderful man to share your life with and I hope that both of you can free yourself of this garbage behaviour and be surrounded by folks who care about and support both of you.",
            "These are not your friends.",
            "i think people are probably asking about the disability more out of curiosity rather than as a gauge to determine if they would agree with those unfriendly friends.",

            "One thing you can see from the responses is that everyone has their own medical issues, some of them more visible than others, some of them that require more or less medical interaction and support than others. Some mental health disorders are just as if not more crippling than what keeps you in a wheelchair, but that many people may not be aware. I bet one of those \"friends\" has a medical problem that isn't well known, that they are uncomfortable with sharing, and that requires a lot of support in one way or another. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe're all the same species. One thing I've gathered from being 40+ is that you can't get 2 people my age or older in a room before they start talking about medical issues. And it's comforting to be able to know that people are just like you, that they have problems, and nobody is exempt from father time and bad luck. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo the friends I'd say none of this shit is any of your business. Since when is it normal to interfere in other people's relationships? (provided there isn't abuse occurring of course). I'd get rid of those people, they don't belong in your life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR those \"friends\" aren't being very nice people, and are likely hypocrites.",

            "My husband\u2019s friends tried to get him to leave me shortly after my diagnosis, 6 years ago. We\u2019d only been dating a year and he\u2019d never had a girlfriend before me. These were his two closest friends. They pretty much tried to convince him that I was just a financial drain and that he\u2019d regret staying with someone he had to take care of. He had already promised me he\u2019d stay with me, no matter what, but something they said got to him. \n\nThe ironic part of that being that my condition doesn\u2019t necessarily get worse over time. It does get bad for a lot of people, but just as many go on to lead next-to-normal lives, albeit with occasional nerve issues and pain/weakness. My condition happened to not get worse. But they still tried and my husband almost believed them. I flipped out on him and told him that if his only concern was that I would be a financial burden he should go ahead and leave me, because I would NOT be reduced down to a number in his checkbook. Plus, I was working! Still am! He quickly realized how shitty his friends were being. \n\nUnfortunately that resentment never goes away either. I still despise those two friends, who acted nice to my face and secretly tried their hardest to break us up. It sounds like your boyfriend is okay at telling them to back off, but it wouldn\u2019t be out of line for him to tell them that if they don\u2019t knock it off, you both won\u2019t be seeing them for a while. And if other friends in the group try to ask why you\u2019re avoiding them, tell them the truth. They\u2019ll have to live with the consequences of their shitty behavior.",
            "So this is probably going to get lost in all the comments but the shared friends can go fuck themselves. My mom beat stage 4 cancer when she was 25 and it left here with a multitude of disabilities. My dad still married her even though his whole friend group advised him not to. Guess what? They have been married for 27 years and even though they have had rough times they are both very much happy. \n\nAnother point my Fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother is married to a woman who is also wheelchair bound. His mother hates FBILs fianc\u00e9 because of it. In her yes she didn\u2019t want to see her son burdened in the prime of his life. But here\u2019s the part that she doesn\u2019t understand and it\u2019s if people generally love each other disabilities don\u2019t exists. I could say his friends may generally be looking out for your Fianc\u00e9\u2019s best interest but by no means should they try and convince him. There should only be one conversation about the topic. They are completely negating the fact you\u2019re a human with feelings who also loves him. In all honestly you might have to add distance to the relationship because they are very clearly crossing boundaries.",
            "First off, I want to say how sorry I am. As disabled folks we are often made to feel like a burden or just feel like one anyway, especially to those we love most. You are not worthless.   \n\n\nThis happened to me in a previous relationship. I started getting sick just a month in. It wasn't until years later his family sat him down to try and talk him out of marrying me. They said they loved me but thought my disability would wear ON HIM. That he would not be able to support me emotionally, physically and with medical bills financially (that I would bankrupt him), in the the long run.   \n\n\nThing was, at the time we loved each other. We supported one another and our relationship was great. Yes, he was my caregiver during bad flares but it brought us closer. This sit down was out of left field while I was dealing with life threatening stuff. Like possibly dying. It was the worst timing and they acted like it was an intervention. I was young, worried about dying and now worried my partner would leave me because of his family's wishes, a family I thought loved me and accepted me as one of their own.   \n\n\nI learned that some healthy people see disabled as less than. As if being disabled or being with someone disabled is jail sentence and one could not possibly be happy and achieving their fullest without being held back. I also learned that once you accept you have an incurable disease and try to live with it rather than fight it and pretend to be healthy some friends and family just will not get that. They will see that as giving up and not trying to be \"healthy again,\" because they think anything can change, miracles can happen, don't give up, positivity can cure anything, exercise, yoga, Jesus, can fix you.   \n\n\nSorry for the wall of text. Those people, they don't get it. They likely will not until they themselves are faced with something similar. You don't have to wait around for that. Fuck them. They are ignorant assholes.",

Do I ever for a second think about leaving him? Fuck no. I had to deal with the same issue and I cut those people out of my life. Good riddance",

I myself am disabled (paraplegic) and when dating my now husband a family friend asked him if he really loved me, when he answered \"yes\", they told him to look up the definition of \"love\" and \"pity\". That was super lame too. I think about that sometimes, and think Fuck you!  We've been married for over 22 years. Fuck your \"friends\".",
            "So my question to your friends is...\n\nAre they jealous of the love and the attention your fianc\u00e9 is giving you and could that be the reason why they are trying to undermine your relationship with him?\n\n\nAnd my statement to you...\nPlease don't ever think that you are worthless.",

            "I have been the friend in this scenario, recommending that a friend leave his girlfriend who had a disability (MS). However, it wasn't completely about the disability. For example, my friend would give up all sorts of his time to care for her when she had flare-ups, but would use her condition (whether it was affecting her at the time or not) to not provide him with support when he needed it. She used her disability to get out of being a good girlfriend and he deserved better.",
            "My husband is disabled and 19 years older than me.\n\nAs my relatives get older and start dealing with changes in their spouse's health, I realize how lucky I am. I already know where rock bottom was/is for him and how best to deal with it. There aren't any surprises or disappointments (and there won't be any) because, well, been there, done that, got the t-shirt.\n\nI think far too many couples live in a fantasy world where neither will get old or sick. You and your fiance are already successfully conquering reality! Congratulations!",
            "Objectively yes it's normal. I know someone who married someone with Ms. People tried to talk her out of it. He's a totally different person now and it ruined her life.\n\nIf you love or care about someone you want their life to be as easy as possible. Marrying a very disabled person is a hard life. Even if your condition doesn't get worse you will age and what you can do will lessen.\n\nIt doesn't mean those same people don't like you or care about you. They are looking out for their friend or family member, which is okay.",
            "I\u2019ll say it. This is the Internet. You\u2019re using a throwaway account. It\u2019s super anonymous here. Why aren\u2019t you providing any details on your disability and specifically what it prevents you from doing? Why do you tell us what these people \u201cbasically\u201d said but not what they said word for word? \n\nThere\u2019s an enormous difference between someone that\u2019s trying their best and someone who isn\u2019t. My uncle Steve hasn\u2019t worked a day in 35 years because he thinks he\u2019s too good to work retail, but he\u2019s not qualified for anything else. He says he can\u2019t stand for long periods of time, but he is often participating in hobbies and \u201centrepreneurial ventures\u201d that require lots of standing. He\u2019s never applied for a job and explained his situation. He\u2019s never done anything to try to bring in guaranteed money.\n\nIf someone suggested to his wife that she leave him, he\u2019d undoubtedly explain it just the way you did - \u201cthey\u2019re telling her to leave me because I\u2019m disabled!!\u201d but the reality is they\u2019d be telling her to leave him because she kept working retail through her chemotherapy while he played around at home and never applied for a single job. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re like Uncle Steve, but you\u2019ve given no indication what your situation actually is. It\u2019s horrible to suggest that someone should leave someone for developing a disability, but it\u2019s appropriate to suggest a breakup if there\u2019s a serious lack of effort. Your low-effort post without any details makes me a bit concerned, let\u2019s put it that way.",

And as you said you and you fiance have talked about it multiple times. You're friends don't know your dynamic and how you are together 24/7 and they need to butt out and try to be more empathetic towards you guys. What they are doing is very rude.

            "I think it is normal to caution friends against long-term decisions that may not be in their best interests. I am not saying that you are going to be bad for your fianc\u00e9 in the long term, I am just saying it\u2019s normal for friends to give caution if they think that is happening. \n\nA few years back, a close family member of mine revealed that his fianc\u00e9 had been divorced 4 times prior. We had no idea because he\u2019d never once mentioned it during the two years they were dating. The majority of my family started cautioning him - are you sure this is a good idea? Maybe you should have a very long engagement before making a legal commitment??\n\nHe got mad at us. He told her and she HATED us. He married her anyway and we tried to support him. They were divorced a little more than a year later. \n\nI don\u2019t think we were being awful in cautioning him. We weren\u2019t trying to hurt either of them. We weren\u2019t trying to vilify his partner. We just saw a potential threat to his long-term happiness and we tried to caution him. \n\nUsually, no one knows what\u2019s going to happen and it\u2019s a gamble. In any relationship, one partner could get hit by a bus tomorrow and become paralyzed  - you can never know if/when the person you are with will have their health/mobility/well being compromised. \n\nIn your case, your friends are most likely thinking about how your fianc\u00e9\u2019s life will be limited by your disability. And while he is happy and okay with it now, being put in a caretaker role for a long period of time can really wear on people and make them sad and resentful if it\u2019s not balanced properly. If it gets to that point, the person being taken care of will suffer from feeling like undesirable and like a burden. If it continues to break down, you have two unhappy people being held together by a disability that both feel bound by. \n\nYou are deserving of love. I don\u2019t know in what way/how exactly you are disabled, but it does not make you any less deserving of love and respect. It is absolutely possible you and your partner can manage this and both be happy, well taken care of, and balanced. Your disability does not have to be a cage around your relationship. \n\nBut your friends don\u2019t know. They don\u2019t know and they are likely worried. Expressing this does not make them terrible, awful people. I think you should tell them together, as a couple, that you both understand their concern, but that it is not their business or their place to push this any further. \n\nIf they keep doing it?

Two stop talking to these negative disrespectful people, they're lowering you're self worth and they are not worth keeping if they're that toxic. Talk to your bf calmly stating your disability is somehting that affects you, but nit the relationship, tell him you're nit willing to be around negative people but if he wants to dint stop him. Over time these people will drift away. Your bf sounds like he handles it right by being calm and just saying \"I wanna be with her\".

The fact that they repeatedly push back against his active decision to be with you is concerning. Even more concerning is that your disability is literally the only thing that they can't wrap their heads around. Your future relationship together and you, yourself, should not be defined in such limiting terms as just a disabled person. \n\nThey are not being supportive of y'alls huge long term choice to get married and might do the same with future big decisions.

I try to clean and keep the house tidy but the majority of the time I at the least need his help with that.\n\nHe has never once made me feel like I was worthless. He constantly tells me how much he loves me, how happy he is to have me, and how happy he is to be the one to be here for me.\n\nYour relationship is NONE of their business.

This was the person I fell in love with, that I want to be with, and pretty much that's that. It can be very hard for other people to understand though. And of course feel free to message me if you ever have any questions about what this kind of situation can be like from the other side. Because it is challenging, and I didn't always handle it gracefully. \n\n\nIf I had one piece of advice to give it would be to let him make his own decisions. Don't get in your head and decide to do something you think is for the best for him.

            "This made my heart hurt for you. For years now I have been dealing with mounting medical issues. Some are under control as well as can be expected, some are still healing, and some we will spend the rest of our life working with. Just in the last two years I have had to have four surgeries and have not been able to walk on both feet. I am just now going through physical therapy for that, and my PT has told me that realistically I am looking at always having some kind of pain because of the extent of the damage. Since 2015 I have had over 10 surgeries. My partner has been there for me through everything. He has taken me to every surgery and helped me wake up from surgery without a huge freakout. He has walked me to the bathroom and lifted me up for months, when I couldn't do it for myself after a particularly grueling surgery. Through all of it we have become even more close, more intimate, more bonded, than we were before we started my healing journey. We have been there for each other in every way possible. And yes, it is possible to be a support to someone even when you are in the middle of your own healing journey. I was there for my partner when his family member passed away. I suffered quietly and without complaint while we had to get from plane to plane while I was still in a leg cast. I did that because I wanted to be there for him the same way he has been there for me. We are capable of doing these things regardless of what others think. \n\nOur friends have been nothing but supportive of the both of us. HIS friends have been nothing but supportive of the both of us. They have all been supportive of my challenges. It would break my heart if they ever turned around and tried to get my partner to leave me. I would not react mildly.\n\nOP, please talk to your partner about how you really feel about these people that are pretending to be your friends. Because the truth of the matter is that true friends do not insist that your partner leave you based on a disability. No friend ever tells another to leave their partner unless there is verified abuse. What they are doing is NOT in YOUR best interest. BOTH of you should not have these people in your lives anymore. Your partner should want to cut these people out of his life an much as you should. They are not allies or friends of your relationship.",

I don't want to presume to know anything about how your disability impacts your life and how it has changed things between you and your SO, and of course there will be changes and challenges, but newsflash to these \"friends\": every relationship, regardless of either partner's ability, has changes and challenges. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're fianc\u00e9 has shown he still sees you as a person that he loves and can continue to love and work on building a life with. You both would probably do well edging these toxic and ableist people out of your lives. If you want support on intimacy with disability and combatting ableism, there are some really great accounts on instagram! I love @miamingus, the online free magazine and instagram account Salty/@saltyworld, and @rubyvallegra, just to name a few. I hope you get all the support and love you need from all the important people in your life!",
            "What a pack of shits. He knows you have a disability. They don't need to remind him. If he was struggling with it then he'd tell you. If he just couldn't go on for some reason then he'd break it off. He's an adult. Why do they think he needs help making a decision he's already made? I guess they are 20 somethings who think sickness and disability are rare events. Wait til they enter their 40s.",
            "It would be one thing if they were just having a conversation with him and asking things like, are you sure you can handle this, are you fully aware of what might happen in the future, etc, but to actively encourage him to leave you because of your disability.. Honey...those are not \"friends\" by any stretch of the imagination.  To either one of you.\n\nI've been married for over 30 years. Just before our 20th anniversary my DH became disabled. The first few months were pure hell, trying to get him diagnosed and treated. There was memory loss involved and he had to relearn a lot of things. It was like having an adult sized toddler in some ways.  So many times over the past 10+ years (usually when seeing new doctors) I have heard medical professionals say to DH \" You're so lucky she stayed.\"  Makes me see red every single time.  I might have looked at a few of them and said \" So nice of you to make assumptions about what kind of person I am, having spent an entire 5 minutes talking to me.\".  \n\nYou don't need that kind of negativity in your life. I wish the two of you nothing but happiness in your life together.",
            "People can be mean as hell. I have a disability that    isn't visible. I have a bad case of Central Virtago.  It is caused by scaring in my brain .Because I have died three times. I have had heart seizures . People don't understand that that it can happen to THEM",
            "It\u2019s a relationship between two people. And I think he is adult enough to know what he wants. And if he is telling you that he wants to stick around the trust that and don\u2019t let anyone come between that! Every relationship has challenges, and just because yours might look different to a \u201cnormal relationship\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not doable. Block out the noise and just focus on the two of you. If they were true friends they would be supportive, helping and understanding. Those who matter don\u2019t mind and those who mind, don\u2019t matter!",
            "If there is anything he needs to leave it's those shitty friends, they have no right to tell him that he should leave a happy relationship because you happen to be disabled. \n\nIt is not normal to do this and you have every right to be upset at their poor judgment of what's \"best\" for the two of you.",
            "I suffer from mental illness (ptsd among other things tied to childhood rape) and after 10 years I've never felt accepted by my SO's family. This past week during a trip they pretty much confirmed this by ganging up on me to essentially tell me to act normal, get over things, and be more like them. The next day during a memorial they went off on a whole rant about how we need to support people with mental illness and all I could do was roll my eyes at them and their hypocrisy. Seems they only wanna help the mental ill as long as they act \"normal\" and don't cause trouble. \n it's very demoralizing to find out what people like that really think of you. I'm of the opinion that I would just rather take a scalpel to people like that and cut them out of my life. Unfortunately I can't do that with my spouse's family. All I can do is avoid them. I certainly wouldn't put up with that shit from friends though.",
            "One of my friend has EDS (Ehler Danlos Syndrom) and it's gotten quite unmanageable for her over the past 2-3 years. Her husband's own PARENTS have tried to break them up because of my friend's EDS...\n\nI wonder what they would have thought if the situation was reversed.\n\nLiving with someone with a disability must be very difficult. I can see that. But he loves you and you love him. Like married people \"in sickness and in health\". Nobody should try to break you up. \n\nMy friend's husband has told his parents to back off or he will stop seeing them.",
            "Your \"friends\" are pos ass holes. Wtf. Having a disability makes you no less of a person or unworthy of dating. My boyfriend has one due to a myopathy and I love him regardless of it. It doesn't change who he is to me or how I feel. I'm sure your fiance feels the same way. They are ignorant and know nothing. I would love him even if he got worse and became wheelchair dependant. I would lose those morons honestly. Maybe they'll be happier without you guys. They sound like poisonous people.",
            "I'm surprised that your fiance kept hanging out with them after the first time they suggested he leave you, but multiple times? Why did it take that many times and for you to find out about it? Maybe he wasn't ready to let go of his group of buddies, that would be hard.\n\nI also have chronic illness, and I don't really have anyone to rely on without being treated like I'm lazy or not that sick etc. My ex's family questioned why he was with me and also told him that I could get better, which led to him verbally abusing me over a span of years and forcing me to take multiple medications and supplements that ended up making me bed-ridden. If you can find someone who understands, life is so much better. These friends are not friends to either of you, if they were they'd understand kicking you to the curb wouldn't be what's best for you, they just want to party with your fiance more and think you're keeping him from doing that. That's not concern for either of you, fuck these selfish twats and find friends who care about both of you equally.\n\n If your fiance doesn't think it's a problem to hang out with people who are plotting to make him leave you then that's a red flag as well. I doubt he thinks that way if he's told you about it now. Good luck to you both, I hope you both can move on happily without toxic friends in your lives.",
            "Basically keep short. Find out who these friends are. And kick them out of your group. You don't need toxic people like that in your life and your fiance's life. He's staying with you because he chooses and he loves you. I wouldn't trust these people as far as I can throw them.",
            "well, no, their behaviour isn\u00b4t normal, and yeah, it\u00b4s ok for you to be upset, people like that have nothing to do your relationship with your fiance, also, it\u00b4s you and fiance\u00b4s choice and they should respect your relationship and stop trying to take both, your and your fiance\u00b4s happyness away",
            "Maybe it would be good for those people to see this thread and all the support you're getting!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously it's none of their business and so they have zero right to have any influence over your or your fiance's choices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do think that if they really had both of your interests at heart, they'd also be having the conversation with you, asking if you're sure you want to stay with him and asking about perceived reasons why he's not good for you. So if they haven't then that is a lie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI saw another poster talking about a \"check-in\" conversation, which I think is fair but again if they were friends of yours, they should also check in with you as well.  To me the check in is not because of your disability, but I believe any couple that sees a long-term relationship ahead of them should think about what a future together would look like, and whether that's a future they want to be a part of.  And I think it's fair enough for friends to ask about whether you've both thought about that.",
            "Alright then OP here's what I call the blunt truth:  You're NOT overreacting at all. What they're doing trying to convince your fiance to leave you then deny to your face is underhanded AND abusive. Most likely a manipulative technique called gas-lighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou and you're fiance love each other no matter what and that's the only thing that should count.  Sit down with your beloved and have a very serious and civil talk together that those losers are toxic and need to be avoided.\n\nThose fake friends, what do they know? They're either probably jealous or just irritated that one of their inner circle picked someone different from them so they're trying to separate you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep your head high, give those jerks the law of ice and keep moving forward with your fiance. And please keep us posted, you've got a lot of support here from the looks of it. ;)",
            "You have every right to be upset! Two members of my family have MS which has placed them in wheelchairs but they are both married with loving partners. Your fianc\u00e9e friends seem to not understand him very well, if they don\u2019t accept his desire to be with the woman he loves. Being disabled doesn\u2019t define who you are and they shouldn\u2019t be focusing on that, but your personality and wonderful attributes that I am sure you have! You have every right to be upset, but do not let their ignorance cloud your mind with negativity. Perhaps confront them in a calm manner and show the, what an incredible person you are! (Kill them with kindness!) I\u2019m sorry if this wasn\u2019t very helpful but I more just wanted to cheer you up! Hope it helps. X",
            "Holy Sh*t, you need new friends. Long and short of it, they are not YOUR people. They are not thinking of your (or your partners) best interests, they are projecting their own misconceptions and misunderstanding on your relationship. Tell them to mind their own business and either help lift your relationship or you'll be getting new mates. No idea what your disability is but I'm sure you're rocking a wheelchair/crutches/whatever you need to help you!",
            "Wow...Okay I was just in a similar your situation. I wont go into huge details: do in short I am fully disabled with a feeding tube among other issues, and his family pressured him to end it whenever I came up in conversation. I gave him \"an out\" almost monthly, and he also had his own set of issues. He gave into the pressure and ended it in a very personal way. It sounds like your partner cares deeply for you. If it were me I would have a deep conversation about any concerns either of you have. Evaluate how you both feel about this pressure shoved your way. And come up with a game play for how to deal with this together. Neither of you should be hearing this from your friends...They are honestly showing disrespect to both of you by pressuring for a breakup. Thats my take, if you want to talk feel free to dm me though :)",
            "I totally respect this guy. The way he handled it shows he isn\u2019t there for anyone but you. This is a perfect example of how a relationship should be.",
            "It\u2019s pretty clear to me that your friends are uneducated and close minded. They\u2019ve always believed that interabled couples aren\u2019t a thing. But there is absolutely nothing wrong with being in an interabled relationship. You and your fianc\u00e9 love each other and that\u2019s what matters. It\u2019s really shitty of them to try to convince him to leave. It is completely valid for you to be upset by this. You deserve to be happy, and if they are trying to take your happiness away, you really don\u2019t need them. They aren\u2019t true friends.",
            "I know you don't want to be specific but a disability can be a huge burden to consider. Anything from making life difficult and requiring a caretaker later on, to shortening your lifespan, to issues with kids (both more difficulty with childcare and risk of passing on genetic disabilities). The important thing is that your fiance fully understands all of this before getting married and that you both have discussed it in depth. You want 0 surprises later on. Beyond that, your friends should be supportive as long as your future husband knows what to expect. It's fair for them to be concerned as long as they are also respectful of his wishes.",
            "I think you may be over reacting here. I think it makes perfect sense that they, having known you before and during your disability, express concern over the happiness of your able bodied partner and be concerned that maybe he should leave if he can't handle it. I very much doubt that if you and he had gone into this relationship with you having a disability, they'd say anything. It was the shock of your disability's onset and knowing he wasn't ready for it (nor were you I'm sure!) that probably prompted these conversations.\n\n\n\nMaking sure that he is happy and understands that there is still time to get out if he can't handle the burden of a disabled spouse (which is for your sake as much as his) is just being a good friend to both of you. Caretaker burnout is a thing and a lot of people have 3rd hand experience with it (a parent caring for a grandparent, a sibling caring for a sibling, etc). I think it's normal for people to be concerned when a friend's SO becomes disabled. \n\n\n\nLook - if they aren't pressing it now, he's shut them down and you've told them that hurt your feelings - I'd try to let it go and move forward. This wasn't personal (as much as I'm sure it feels that way) and it honestly sounds like you never should have been privy to these private conversations anyway. He shut them down with the correct response so why did you need to know about them? This is just creating drama where none was needed.",
            "Doesn't sound like a 'shared' friendship group at all.  The sound like a bunch of shallow-minded arseholes with nothing better to do than dictate another person's happiness.  Fuck them all, you don't need that type of shit (literally) in your life.  I'm glad your fella is a good man, hard to come by men like that with true integrity nowadays",
            "Dating and carrying on a relationship with disabilities is hard. \n\nI have crohns disease and my girlfriend of 7 years basically left me after I got sick. She knew I had crohns, but I was healthy the majority of our relationship. The last year I got sick and admitted to the hospital. For me it sucked, affected my job, I was depressed etc. Not having control over things that drastically change your life? Things you didnt ask for? Things you didnt make happen by some bad decisions? Sucks. I was told \"I love you, but I'm not in love with you\".\n\nSo not only are you born with genetics that hurt you, normal people treat you like your damaged, unworthy of love, a waste product. It's very hard for people who have never had any sort of similar experience to empathize, that's without mentioning the complete decline of compassion and empathy we are seeing now days. So you have a disadvantage which cause depression, anxiety, stress, and people go out of their way to make it even harder for you. \n\nIn OPs position? I would hope that if these people keep expressing this opinion under the disguise of \"we just want what's best for you!!!\", to bounce them out of your social circle. There are amazing people out there willing and able to love a human being who isnt physically perfect. Some people wont get that. I would hope if your SO is one of these people he would explain to them that he loves you, as a person, disabilities and all, and they need to stop questioning who he loves. It isnt their business and their opinions of love and life are not the same as your husbands. They seem a little immature and less evolved. \n\nPersonally if they expressed this more than once I would have killed the friendships right then and there but that's just me. \n\nThey are in the wrong, you have every right to be furious no matter how much they sugar coat it. You deserve love, and someone to enjoy your journey with.",
            "I have disabilities. \n\nYour fiance sounds awesome, his friends are mogs.",
            "You seem to have a good fiance. A close in my family was disabled, and it did not hinder a fulfilling live with his wife. You should read the book or see the film \u201cA man called Ove\u201d. It is a fun story and involves a couple with one disabled.",
            "Only if your disability causes him such unhappiness that they felt they needed to express it for his well being. \n\nBut generally speaking I don't think people should comment on their friends relationships at all. They tend to see one side and everything is extremely biased. \n\nHowever if you have a friend and their SO treats them wrong, or causes them unhappiness that is effecting them deeply I feel there is an obligation to try and show them that, gently. \n\nThe disability component to me is irrelevant. Disabilities don't excuse or cause toxic relationships. \n\nSo with all that said - I don't think discussing the disability at all is relevant. If they think he's unhappy they surely can say that. But placing it on your disability is presumptuous and frankly kinda gross.",
            "I'd you're both happy it's really none of their Damn business. My husband and I had been together just shy of 2 years when I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease. We've been together for 13 years  now and he's been by my side through 5 surgeries, multiple emergency room visits and hospital stays, and has even had to help me clean up after I'm literally exhausted from the pain.\n\nThere's that passage in the Bible from Corinthians\n\n Corinthians 13:7 \n\"Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.\"\n\nAnd I think your friends need to take that to heart. They don't sound like very good friends.",
            "I'm sorry you're dealing with these shallow-assed \"friends\". It's a shame that they think having a physical disability somehow makes you \"less than.\"  Clearly, they're the ones with something missing. \n\nI'm wondering if some of these friends are family members? It becomes harder to tell family to FO, though not impossible. If they don't have a come-to-Jesus moment and beg your forgiveness, they need to go.",
            "It's possible you aren't getting the whole story. It could be that your fiance complains about the difficulties in his life that come with your disabilities and then they counsel him to find someone else, like they would with anyone they think isn't making him happy. I doubt he's going to tell you he's complained to his friends about your disability. People are jerks but I just can't see multiple friends being so tactless as to say out loud to him unsolicited that he should leave you for being disabled.",
            "Dump your friends. That's absurd. They are basically saying you are sub human and dont deserve happiness. Truly WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK.",
            "They are his friend not yours. Obviously they will think about him. But if he do not listen to them  then they shouldn\u2019t try to convince him again. Case closed. I will to would have tell him to leave you if he is my friend. Being realistic here. But if he is happy then I wouldn\u2019t bring this topic again. May sound cruel but that\u2019s how real life works. Just ignore them, if he loves you he will continue to love you and stay with you forever no one can convince him to leave you. It clearly shows your relationship is strong. Just don\u2019t ruin it by asking him to leave his friend. He has his own choice to who to be with friend or not.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Google Turia Pitt and her man. Then show your friends how shallow they are.",
            "NTA- their concern is unwarranted unless they are seeing obvious negative signs that are impacting both of you. Unless your fiance is going to them and saying that you are abusing him or he is unable to deal with caring for you - there is no reason for them to think this way. They would be the assholes in this situation.",
            "This is normal behavior for people who have not experienced loss of health.\n\nYou are allowed to be upset.\n\nUnderstand though, you're still pretty young. People really will not understand until their own bodies are falling apart. Then it becomes no big deal.\n\nYou're very lucky that your fiance isn't listening to them. TBH, I would probably have given him the same advice at your ages. I'm old now and know better. ;)",
            "I\u2019m really wondering why you don\u2019t state what it is. If it\u2019s something like a functional pain disorder or a somatoform disorder, those have a huge psychological component and maybe that\u2019s why those friends aren\u2019t keen on you. If it\u2019s truly a purely medical condition then they are assholes, but I don\u2019t get why if you\u2019re posting anonymously you can\u2019t just say what it is? Seems like a way to get people to agree with you without providing all the necessary information",
            "Let\u2019s turn this situation around. Let\u2019s say that your long time best friend was dating someone who had a mental or physical disability. And in your mind, you felt that your best friend didn\u2019t consider the long term consequences of that person\u2019s disability. As a best friend, wouldn\u2019t you feel it is your duty to remind and advise them as to what they should consider before engaging in a long term relationship? \n\nIsn\u2019t it better for you to know that your guy has all of the information in front of him and yet he still wants to be with you long term?  Would you rather he goes blindly into this, and then wakes up in a couple of years to say that he doesn\u2019t want to do this anymore?\n\nI get that all of this puts you in a most vulnerable situation. I also understand that his friends have no business telling him to leave you. \n\nHis friends are actually doing you a great service, even though their actions seem to fly in your face. This does not endear them to you today, but this should work out best in the long term. \n\nIf you want clarity, now is the time to talk this through with your partner. His words may give you great comfort.",
            "\u201cPushing my wheelchair\u201d .. okay so I\u2019m not going to lie I really have a hard time blaming them. As harsh as it sounds, people being in wheelchairs is a major hinder on ones quality of life. I\u2019m not surprised at all why his friends are saying it. It\u2019s not that they are trying to be assholes to you, but they care for their friends and in their eyes, they see him submitting his life to pushing around this girl in a wheelchair. I donno. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s okay, but it\u2019s also not really wrong. If your bf loves you, what are you worried about? What can you really do about this? Nothing."

            "Cheating with 3 people? That makes me exhausted just thinking about it.  Does she actually live with you?",
            "OP, you must continue pretending to love her. Do everything you do as if you love her, but when she goes out to have a good time, you get to work on your plot. Only then will your hard work prevail. Give her the papers as a holiday gift.",
            "Hey man. This is super fucking rough. I definitely feel for you, brother. But at least you found out now, while your still young enough to live an extremely full life with someone who genuinely cares about you. Take some time for yourself. Go on a trip out of country with some friends if you can. But definitely don't try and salvage this shit show of a marriage. She is NOT the One. ",
            "I've been there man. Your whole world becomes unanchored. It takes a long time to find your footing again. It's going to be a long hard road. Remember, you've done nothing wrong. This is about her and her failings as a person. \n\nWhat helped me was realizing that the woman I loved was gone. She was dead, and a complete stranger was walking around in her place. The woman you loved is gone. What's left is something...less.\n\nStray strong and remember the immortal words of Freddie Mercruy, \"The show must go on.\" ",
            "Sorry man. :-/\n\nGet tested for all the STDs.",
            "Get tested.",

            "I like another update, of what her reasons or what she does when you tell her to suck it!! That is will be a priceless look when,  hey I got this email for this women that says you are banging her BF and sent me all this info! sorry your hurting but look at it like better to know now, then with kids that may not be yours and 20 years of lies!",
            "I know I'm just another internet stranger, but my thoughts go out to you man. I know this is going to be a terrible time for you, and I hope you make it through everything ok.",
            "That definitely sucks. At least someone told you and didn't let it go on any longer. I would thank that woman. ",
            "Get yourself a lawyer and file for divorce.  The biggest mistake people make in your situation is getting stuck in the mud.\n\nYou can always put a stop to the proceedings if you decide to reconcile, but the consequences for cheating must be serious and swift.",
            "wow man, im sorry....\n\nforward all the emails to your account. depending on where you are in the world it may help the divorce.\n\nYou could always reach out to the GF that sent you the messages. i know in times like this, it helps to talk with someone who has the same experiences.\n\nOnce you get the legal papers all drawn up, please let us know how you are doing, and how the cheating bitch responded to the big reveal.",
            "Sorry you have to go through this man. I know that it's rough and your whole life has been flipped on it's head.\n\nShe doesn't know that you know yet, so take this time to visit a lawyer and get your shit together in preparation for a divorce. You might want to try to work through this, but you need to remember that this woman has no problem lying to your face, exposing you to STDs, and sleeping around behind your back. She is not a good person and needs to be out of your life ASAP.\n\nIn some small way, be happy that you found out now rather than later. Could have X more months/years invested in her, blissfully unaware that the woman you think you know is a lie. Also, get an STD test to be sure. No telling how long this has been going on (or how many partners she's had).",

            "Christy man, sorry you're going through this. Hey tested immediately and screencap the shit out of everything you can. Start lawyer talking and do not let her know until you are in a good place mentally. You don't owe her a heads up, you don't owe her explanation if you don't feel like giving it. Just pick up the pieces and hold on to them until you can put them back again.\n\nIf you get in the gym, you'll probably be able to get a lot of negative feelings out. Good luck man, I wish you the best",

            "Damn OP I'm really sorry it turned out to be real but at least now you know the truth of what kind of person she is. \n\nI'd gather the evidence, make copies, and consult a divorce lawyer before you confront her. Get tested ASAP and don't have sex with her again. \n\nAlso, change any password info of your own so she doesn't find the email and fb message.\n\nYou didn't deserve this OP. Things will get better eventually. Internet hugs.",
            "If you want to get the evidence saved professionally, look up a digital forensics expert and they should be able to pull the info from her phone and computer. I do not know your state, but mine, if you are married both computer and phone you legally own it as well and CAN have it looked through by a Digital Forensic Investigator.",

I honestly have no information for you towards this situation other than take time help yourself.\n\n\nPossibly get a therapist to work through you emotions. If you feel you don't need that then I wish you well in whatever you choose to do to progress forward. If you need an random person's ear to talk to be my guest and PM me.",
            "Get all evidence you can get.\n Before divorcing, I would try to talk. I mean, seriously. \nWhat is the reason she did all to her loved one? \nDoesn't she love you anymore? Is she something missing? Is she doing this for thrill? Then you can show her divorce papers.\nShe wanted it, after all.\nI would start plan future without her right now.
