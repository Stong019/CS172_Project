        "selftext": "My tl;dr is at the bottom. \n\nMy husband (45M) and I (35F) have been together for 10 years. We have two children, an 8 year old and a 9 month old. My husband was a very nice husband before I was pregnant and during my second pregnancy. After our second baby was born he started being very mean to me. He has always been a bit selfish, but it was always something I could handle before.\n\nHe tries to ruin things I have planned. As an example, I was going to take my dad to an event and my husband calls me and tells me he is going to be two hours late to watch the kids because he has to go shopping. Then he tries to push me to be mad at him. He will say, does this upset you? Are you getting mad? Then he will act like I\u2019m the crazy person when I do get upset with him. \n\nHe makes fun of my hobbies or puts down and activity I do.  I actually took up running because he likes it and it was something I could do without him making fun of me. We planned to go on a run together and I set up a babysitter for an hour. I was waiting for him to show up and he never did. When I asked him what he was doing he said he was running. So he left me hanging while he still got to enjoy the activity. This also wasted a precious hour of babysitting time. \n\nHe is also unnecessarily cruel. I went on a four day trip with our two kids. He stayed at home because he had to work. When I came home he told me that maybe he could pick me up from the airport but maybe not. I told him it\u2019s fine I will take a cab. But even up until I got on my plane ride he was telling me if he was free he would be at the airport but there was no guarantee. Then after I got home he immediately started lecturing me on spending money on our older son. Which, after a four day trip of taking care of two kids (one being a baby) I was just exhausted and didn\u2019t want to be lectured the second I walked through the door. So I just told him I agree with you and I\u2019m sorry. But he just kept going and going. \n\nOther examples of him being cruel are him telling a family member that I can\u2019t handle the baby by myself. pouring a pop down the sink that I gave him saying he doesn\u2019t want that pop and then grabbing the exact same brand of pop out of the fridge to drink.  \n\nI could go on but I think these might be enough examples. Like I mentioned earlier, these behaviours have been happening after our second baby was born. As things happen I do usually call him out on the spot, but he usually gaslights me in the moment and we get nowhere. He wants to go to couples therapy or just personal therapy for himself (his idea). But I\u2019m honestly wondering is it worth it? I would prefer not to divorce but I\u2019m honestly wondering if we could save this marriage or should I just walk away? \n\nTl;dr: husband has been treating me very badly for several months. He wants to go to couples therapy but I feel like the damage is done. How do I proceed?",

            "> He wants to go to couples therapy\n\n**Never EVER go to therapy with an abuser.**\n\nAll that will happen is that, as you unburden yourself in a supposedly safe space, he will use the information against you afterwards.  He will gaslight you, insisting that the therapist didn't say what you know damn good and well she did.  He'll try and wear you down and have you doubting your memories and feelings.\n\nIf that doesn't work?  He'll insist that the therapist is biased against him and refuse to go.  He'll counselor shop until he finds someone he's sure will side with him--i.e., someone incompetent who will do the lazy, \"the truth is somewhere in the middle\" bullshit.\n\nPlease, PLEASE, get therapy for yourself, alone.  Your husband is abusing you and it's only going to get worse.  You will reject the \"a\" word--victims always do at first--so if you want to call it \"toxic behavior,\" that's okay.  Having said that, can you look up the following terms for me?\n\n* cycle of abuse\n\n* trauma bonding\n\n* gaslighting\n\n* Issendai sick systems\n\nYour husband's sudden change is par for the abuser's course.  They always wait for a moment when they believe that you are well and truly \"caught\" to start the bullying, the insults, the long slog to destroy your self-esteem.\n\nI know, your first instinct will be to fix him.  Please don't.  You can't.  And no, it doesn't matter why he does what he does:  the important thing is that he IS doing it and that it will destroy you.\n\nPlease visit either/or Thehotline and loveisrespect.  Read through their resources. **Do not use any of your personal electronics to do this.** Get a copy of *Why Does He Do That?*, **but don't keep it anywhere that he can find it.**\n\nThis man will not only destroy *you,* he will destroy your children as well:  growing up in a home with an abuser is...abuse.  If you won't save yourself, PLEASE save your children.  If you don't, they will resent, even hate, you for having done nothing to protect them.",

Since he is currently abusing you, and he wants to go to therapy tell him to go to therapy and figure his shit out or you are leaving. Draw the line at his bad treatment of you and mean it. \n\nI would also do some snooping if I were you to see if he's seeing someone.

Can you have his actions and whereabouts followed or do it yourself? Check out his phone (I don\u2019t encourage this in normal functioning relationships) to see if there is any evidence? I say this because a co worker of mine has been having an affair for almost 2 years and while his wife was completely blindsided, her husband had been really mean to her after their second child and it was around the time he started being mean, that he started his affair. If he is and you can gather evidence, it\u2019ll only help your case in a divorce. Please do homework on what to look for and how to document things and collect evidence; do NOT tell your husband. He\u2019s already abusive and him knowing that you know his secret may put you or the kids in danger.

That's definitely not an uncommon thing to happen after the birth of a child.  \n\nJust thinking that might be behind his personality change.  I am not defending his behavior, but I have gone through periods where I felt rejected by a partner and it eventually built up into bitterness and anger.

Out of all of my personal relationships I have one friend that has remained highly respectful and me likewise over ten years. \n\nIn ever other relationship I have disagreements and arguments and sometimes even falling outs. However usually you can chalk those up to external factors like your partner was stressed out. These posters must have a nice life if they don't have to deal with stress from work, bills, family health because all of that adding up affects the best of people. \n\n\n**** \n\nMy advice: you sound overwhelmed. Sounds like you think you're taking the high road instead of communicating with your husband. Maybe he's too hard to communicate with. That's why therapy is good. You now need to communicate you issues and not look like an ass in front of two people instead of one. Ten years is a lot to throw away. 9 months is pretty early in a child's life and post partem for the mother. You may still be having hormonal changes that are affecting how you feel. Make sure you think about it, there is a lot at stake. I can't really give advixe for your husband because he's not here and he's not reading it so don't take this as an attack on the OP. She's the one asking for advice not him. \n\nTherapy will really help. Even if you end up divorced. Even a mediator if you can't afford it. It's not like a therapist says much anyway. \n\nAnyone",

Maybe because you said it was cute. Either way, I would sit her down and talk to her about the broken things. Explain that you can't keep replacing your expensive items, and you can't keep replacing your wardrobe, and that from here on out, if she breaks something, she has to repurchase it for you. Then also broach the fact that none of her stuff is broken. Ask how she's managed to break and ruin tons of your stuff, but none of her own. If she was that clumsy, then her stuff would be broken too. \n\nEither way, keep all of your nice things locked up. I think your relationship is coming to an end unless she confesses. A relationship isn't sustainable without trust, and right now you don't trust her. ",

It was some weird control thing.\n\nMaybe, similar to how the boyfriend would stash that lady's away to keep her from leaving, OP's GF is breaking stuff to exert some control over OP.

He didn't ever break anything expensive like that, but he destroyed so many of my things during the year that he lived with me it wasn't even funny.  All kinds of my things got broken, lost or just simply thrown away.  And he didn't care.  He was throwing away my spoons like they were disposable.  Literally would throw them away with the container that he took his lunch in to work.  And when I asked him why the spoons were missing, he couldn't account for it.  The only reason I realized what was happening is I found one of his lunch containers sitting in the trashcan with the spoon inside of it.  He just laughed about it.  That's just a small example of what used to happen.  He would throw away washrags like they were disposable too.  I would find them in the trashcan like paper towels \"it was dirty\".  That's what a washing machine is for, asshole.\n\nBUT, the point of my story is that I realized that he never actually had to provide for himself.  He had never lived on his own or had to furnish anything himself.  He lived with his mom before he moved in with me.  He didn't know the value of things.  He didn't realize how much it costs to HAVE those things and replace them when they are lost, broken, etc.  ",

Sometimes I straight-up forget I'm holding something and it ends up on the floor before I remember. Sometimes I forget I'm holding something and then I look down and I've *disassembled* it, because apparently my subconscious' favorite thing to do is *ooh, new thing, break it*. \n\nMy boyfriend thinks this is very cute, but this is because it does not actually impact his life! I try very hard to take better care of things that are not mine! I use both hands to interact with his teacups and if he hands me a computer to show me something I pause whatever I am doing and give it my full attention. I don't break his things, not because I'm not horribly clumsy but because I *know* I'm clumsy and I am *careful*.

She feels entitled to your expensive things even though she makes absolutely no effort to take care of them, and that's unacceptable and you have *every* right to take them away. Tell her she's not ever ever allowed to touch anything you own until she pays you back for all the things she's destroyed. No discussion or compromise.

Or broken your phone? What's going on there? While she's upset that you're restricting her access to your stuff... I mean, it's your stuff.

I don't have the money to pay for it outright, but let me reimburse you over a few months until it's paid off.\" It seems to me it's either some kind of bizarre attention-seeking behaviour, or she genuinely doesn't give a crap about your things.",

If you are constantly having to remind her to be careful or please don't wash or do this and she still does it anyways, that's bad. She has zero consideration for you or your things. Either way there comes a point where you realize that there is no way I'm spending the rest of my life with this child.

I feel like the biggest asshole, so I do everything I can to stay the fuck away from other people's breakable shit.

The parents told us that it was only other people's things, which they used as evidence against her.\n\nWhen I started working with her in her room, I realized all her stuff was broken too, but she would hide it because she was too embarrassed to tell her parents. She couldn't hide breaking other people's things though, so that's all her parents knew about. Furthermore, she would tell me that handling other people's stuff made her more anxious, which caused her to drop more things.\n\nHer parents were also worried that she was using drugs or alcohol because sometimes she would slur her speech or trip over really obvious things or just act really \"silly\" as they said. Or she would forget really big things or not wake up from school and sleep for 12-16 hours instead.\n\nThen one day, we were in the middle of a session and very suddenly, her speech started to slightly slur. \n\nMy aunt has Multiple Sclerosis and I remember hearing similar stories about her as a young adult, before she was diagnosed.

She likes being able to get away with it. \n\n It sounds crazy, I know that; but from reading your post, anything that holds any value to you is there to be broken in her eyes. Your wool sweaters for example. We all know to wash wool in its own way, I'm sure she did too. \n\n Ultimately you can't trust her. I wouldn't have had the same patience you had. She doesn't take responsibility for what she breaks and I doubt she even feels bad at this stage. If she's going to act like a child, treat her like one when your valuables are concerned. \n\n You aren't going to be able to trust her and she wont admit this is on purpose. If she did I'd imagine you wont want to be with her because...Why would you?! Its a rotten thing to have done to someone. \n\n If you want to salvage what it is you guys have, sit her down. Don't ask her if she did it on purpose but if you can live with her knowing it probably was, then have a one to one. Tell her she can't keep breaking your things and you can't let her use your things because she's costing too much via repairs or replacements that she doesn't need to pay for. Make clear if she breaks anything else its her thats paying for it. Also state that you don't understand how she is so clumsy with your stuff when shes so careful with her own...and then watch as in the coming days something small of hers will break and she'll be so disappointed. \n\n The above might scare her into not breaking your stuff but honestly its not a sign of something good if she feels the need to break your stuff.

If you borrow this and break it, I need you to understand that A) You need to replace this because it is NOT an IPAD or a sweater, it is SERIOUS.  and B) If you break this, I can NEVER, EVER lend you anything ever again.  So if you want to take that on and you are committed to taking care of it, let's DO THIS.\n\nThat's what I'd do.  I've done the same thing with money for people that are bad at paying back.  \"If I lend you this money, you can NEVNER EVER ask me for money AGAIN EVER until you pay me back.  So if you choose to NEVER pay me back, understand that it is in your hands to do that, but you will NEVER, EVER be allowed to ask for money assistance EVER AGAIN, EVER.\"\n\nAnd they didn't pay me back, and it was the best money I ever spent because I got to bring it up as a GUILT-FREE way to not lend money for the rest of my relationship with that person (SISTER).",

My partner is notorious in our household for accidentally breaking shit (we have a separate budget for glassware). Has been this way his whole life.

Her carelessness has affected you financially for sure and that is worth addressing, but perhaps in a harm minimisation way more than anything. Seriously, some folks are just clumsy.",
            "Even if you tell her she needs to replace anything else she breaks, if she stops breaking things you know this is a dealbreaker, all she had to do was care more or change her attitude and she could have saved you 5k, whether it was on purpose or not she willingly cost you 5k by not giving a fuck, good luck man.",

Link to other post is below. \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4dlhk6/i_28f_think_my_husband_35m_might_be_hiding/\n\n\nI asked my husband about everything in my post and he had really good reasons for some of it. It felt like that was the first time in a long time that he was being completely honest with me. He showed me inside the safe, backpack, showed me he had a second phone.\n\n\nFor anyone wondering the backpack just had clothes, an iPad and laptop, toiletries etc for \u201cwork trips.\u201d The safe also held a gun which I had no idea he had. He says he got the second phone because he almost got fired for being unreachable one time so he got another phone on a  different network so his boss can always reach him, and he didn\u2019t tell me because he didn\u2019t want me to worry about him getting fired or us having to move to an area with better reception.\n\n\nI had decided to just leave it at that for a while because he was finally being honest with me and I knew he wasn\u2019t doing anything nefarious so I was just going to drop it, but I saw he left his phone unlocked when he went to the bathroom and I couldn\u2019t help myself so I snooped\u2026 I know thats bad but I just wanted to stop worrying. I looked at his texts and there was one woman who told him she loved him and the texts were really flirty, and another woman who he was talking to but I didn\u2019t have time to read that convo. I only had maybe two minutes on his phone before he came running back from the bathroom (probably realizing he left his phone unlocked). \n\n\nHe knows I know but he doesn't want to discuss it because he doesn't know how much I know, so he's been pretty much avoiding our son and me since then. Honestly I just wish I never picked up his phone in the first place. I know that I need to leave him but just the thought of being a single mom and our son having to live the \"divorced parents\" life makes me sick. I've only told a couple people and my one friend offered to take me and the baby in so I can finish up my maternity leave without having to worry about buying a house, but he has a newish girlfriend so I doubt that would be ok with her, and he works in the same department as my husband. \n\n\nThat's all there is to update on. I know I need to get my shit together and deal with this but I'm having a really hard time pulling it together. \n\n\n**tl;dr**: Lots of lies and he's cheating on me. ",

            "I was wondering how this one turned out - his excuses did sound pretty weak, especially the second phone. I'm glad you snooped and found out (the ends justified the means, here!). \n\nHe was confronted and STILL didn't confess. I hope you remember that and do what's right for you and your kid. Being a child of divorce is likely less harmful than being around two parents who don't get along and having a father who cheats on his wife. ",

            "That sucks to hear, OP. I was hoping that there was a valid reason behind his actions, but turns out he's just a terrible cheater. Divorce may not sound appealing to you at this stage, but I feel like if you stay in this relationship it will only get worse. You will resent each other more and more, you will both be unhappy and if you decide to stay with him because of your child, you are committing yourself to another 18 years with someone who doesn't love or respect you. Do you really want your child growing up in a household thinking that your unhappy marriage is how people in love are supposed to be? \n\nReally, I can only see two options for you from here. You can either stick with him, go to couples counselling, establish communication and try to rekindle what you've lost, but keep in mind that you will always *always* remember that he cheated on you, lied to you and then avoided the whole thing.\n\nThe other path you can go is get a divorce, establish custody boundaries and move on with your life, away from someone who would treat you like this. Staying with your friend might be an okay idea, but if it's going to interfere with their love life it might not be the most considerate one unless its an emergency. Perhaps you could stay with family instead? Honestly though, unless your house is in his name I would kick your husband out and stay right where you are. Good luck.",

That's all you need to do right now. Friends and loved ones can help you get a plan together for the future.",
            "I'm glad you managed to snoop on his phone and found out, because his story about needing a third (secret) phone because he doesn't want to be unreachable at work is bullshit, and it sounded like you believed it.  I mean, he has a work cell phone and a personal cell phone *besides* that one.  And it's a really bad sign even if his reason was true, because a second smartphone account is expensive, and you're his wife... him hiding that from you... gah.\n\nAlso, um... I can't believe you are considering moving out of the house onto a friend's couch.  You have a 2-month-old baby.  He's the one who needs to leave.  \n\n",
            "Your son is young enough that he won't know the difference between having married parents and divorced parents. Your divorce will not be a life event for him, but rather some vague thing that he doesn't remember. I'm certain that he will be grateful to not have to grow up with married parents in a bad relationship. And your son will most likely eventually have a stepdad who isn't a scumbag so he'll have a chance at a decent male role model in his life. He isn't going to get that from your husband.",

I often wish my parents were divorced, as crazy as that sounds.

Sorry you have to deal with this. ",
            "I was with somebody for a while who lied and cheated. We weren't married, but I was committed and put everything into the relationship. \n\nWhen you realize you're being lied to and manipulated, it gets kind of weird, or it did for me anyway. At first, I thought I could handle it, thought I could \"understand\".  And then I just started feeling stupid, used, unappreciated. \n\nBut the worst was not ever knowing when he was telling me the truth. It felt like some bizarre game in which I was always at a disadvantage.  It'll drive you mad, and believe me, it isn't worth it. \n\nIt really hurt to put so much into a relationship, and just have my good nature ripped off, and even used against me. \n\nBut things got much better, very quickly after we split.  I'm now married to a great man who sincerely loves me, and I love the life we have built together. I'm afraid you won't have that with the man you are with now.\n\nThe happier you are, the happier your child will be.  Your child being so young, I would think the courts would give you the vast majority of the time with him.  \n\nBrighter days are ahead. Set a course, and make it so!  Good luck to you. ",

            "Everyone on this thread is giving really great nuggets about possible custody arrangements so I won't add to them, but I would advise you seek an attorney that specializes in family law as soon as possible. Some (not all, but some) will do free consultations and will advise you of your rights as a mother and the possible outcome of divorce proceedings. Just because you consult with an attorney doesn't mean you have to immediately file for divorce (which is a stigma I hear a lot working in a law office). \n\nIIRC your husband has a job that involves government contracting and security clearance? You'll need a lawyer to navigate that during a divorce, if you choose to get one, so you'll want to consult ASAP anyway. =)\n\nI wish you luck in whatever you choose. Stay strong!!",

All five of my siblings have anxiety and depression, I had an eating disorder from my anxiety. Our family is getting extra pulled apart because everyone has a say in our situation because we lived in a small town, and my dad was always a \"stand up guy.\" Don't do that to your child.

            "Hey there. I'm a kid who had divorced parents. I'm now an adult and off on my own life.  \nJust here to say... a kid doesn't need two parents. We can grow up and live happy lives with our parents divorced.  \nFrom what I saw of my friends who had both parents, but the parents no longer either trusted or loved each other, or both, that has a much harder effect on a kid than having parents that live in two separate locations.  \n\nA kid can learn that their two parents can still love them and not love each other.  \nA kid can learn that one parent is a useless piece of shit that only loves themselves, but they still have one caring parent.  \nA kid has a much harder time growing up hearing parents argue, particularly when they get to the age they're capable of discerning that they are the cause of those arguments and that the parents are only together for their sake.  \n\nIt can be hard on a kid, knowing their parents don't like each other and would be happier apart, but they're sticking in this shit situation for their sake.  \n\nAnd it's not like with divorced parents you only have one parent. You have both, they're just in two different houses.  \nYou can make it a fun activity. Like a holiday to go see dad for a few days.  \nYou can both be active in your child's life, without having to put up with each other's company.  \n\nSo... don't feel like you have to stay in this situation just for the sake of your kid. You'll do them no favours. ",
            "To be clear, your marriage is now over as a functional marriage.

Ignore it and live a sham marriage to avoid the \"divorced parents\" scenario\n2. Confront him and either break up or try to fix things\n3. Leave him (/kick him out)\n\nJust remember that despite the fact you were vindicated, looking through his phone was the end of any semblance of trust. If you are to stay together it will be a long, difficult, possibly pointless process. Whether you do that is, of course, your decision - but it's not an easy thing to rebuild that trust. Especially when you know he will lie to you.\n\nEven if you do choose an option where you stay with him, a sham marriage could still end with him leaving. Trying again could end up with failure because of further dishonesty and lack of trust (assuming either of you even want to go down that route).\n\nMy personal opinion is that once cheating occurs, there's no way back, but only you know your relationship and self.",

Did not expect this post to get so much attention. I originally planned to reply to all the comments, but theres like 500 on that post now, PLUS messages in my inbox. So, going to be that person and say a general thank you to everyone who took the time to reach out and weigh in. I read all your comments and messages and I decided to talk to Alan.\n\n\nI texted him before he got done work and asked him if he had any plans after, and if not, I'd like to talk to him about something. He said he'd come straight home.\n\nHe got home and we sat down to talk. I opened with saying that I loved him very much and that he was so different from anyone I'd ever met and let him know how much he means to me. I then said \"But\" and brought up what happened at his parents' dinner. Like many of you suggested, I made it clear to him why it was hurtful/ignorant. I told him that in all our time together, he had never made me feel \"other\" and therefor it was a pretty bad shock to hear him say what he said. I told him that it's hard for a lot of people to be minorities in this country, because you always have other people expecting you to play the cultural-bound immigrant, even if you just aren't interested. \n\nFor me, personally, I just prefer not to have to have one foot in two different worlds. I grew up here and that's all I really identify with. The fact that because I look the way I do, or have the last name I do, people *expect* me to be more than I am in regards to India. It's very frustrating when it's a damned if you do or damned if you don't situation. Even in the thread, I had people saying that I'm ashamed of being of Indian descent because I don't fucking care about all the cultural ties to it. To that I say, hey, did you think Alan was *ashamed* of being German/Irish because he's not calling himself German/Irish -American or keeping any norms alive from those cultures? So once again, it falls on me to have to play this part that I have *no fucking interest in playing*. So stop shoving this idea that people are married to their ancestors' culture down people's throats because it creates yet another barrier when it comes to integration.\n\nAnd then I showed him the thread. \n\nBy the time he got done reading everything, comments included, he look mortified. He apologized for the way he treated me during dinner and he admitted to me that his views had been ignorant. We had a long discussion about norms and attitudes he grew up with, and as many of you noted, Alan grew up with \"white\" being the default for American.  He said he never had thought about how caucasians get a free pass when it comes to being American, but someone with different features is immediately considered an \"other\" and needs a hyphen. I apologized to him for not explicitly spelling it out, but I told him that I assumed in this day and age it would be a little more obvious to him. We talked about future children and we both agreed to have them grow up American, and if later they chose to connect with other roots then that was fine too. He said he never wanted to make our kids feel like he made me feel with those comments.\n\nAnd no, he didn't want the whole Bollywood wedding some people thought he wanted. He was just making sure I knew that i had that choice. But now he has promised not to bring it up again and we've finally laid *that* issue to rest. I also told him, albeit a bit more jokingly, that I wouldn't be making him any rohti so he can stop holding his breath that I'd become some indian housewife. \n\nWe both agreed that this is probably not the last conversation we will have about race. But we also agreed that we wouldn't let it go under the rug again. He said he won't be hyphenating anyone else from now on, and instead let them set that identity for themselves. I appreciated that a lot and I could actually see that he took it seriously, that he wasn't just saying whatever I wanted to hear. \n\nSo, wedding is still on. Yaay\n\nReally, thank you guys so much. It was good to feel validated in this. It made me want to actually approach the issue instead of ducking my head and ignoring it. If I didn't know about this sub, I probably would have kept it bottled and so much resentment would have accumulated before I finally exploded. Like a firework. On 4th of july. :p\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Talked to my fiancee, he was completely mortified after reading the thread/ listening to what I was saying. He is making an active effort to change his views and he apologized to me for the ignorant comments that were made. Wedding is still a go",

            "> people expect me to be more than I am in regards to India\n\nWoah. Relate to this 100%... growing up rural 1h north of Edmonton (basically rural as said before) as an Asian really felt weird in that way. I felt it took me like 2 years before people saw me for more than just my race, though admittedly part of it probably would be because I was kinda introverted/a lone wolf(?)/skipped a lot of school.\n\nGlad everything's going well :D",

They expect me to act a certain way or like certain things, and that has made me want to distance myself from these generalizations. I too feel like I am an American, no need to hyphenate anything. It's so refreshing to read your words and know I am not alone!",
            "As a very small addendum to the otherness/hyphenation discussion, I will say that plenty of white Americans do hyphenate--or perhaps, have if forced upon them?  Whiteness has to do with social acceptability as much as anything else; I mean, Italians and Eastern Europeans weren't \"white\" when they first came to the U.S., for example.  So, yeah, being \"Italian-American\" is a way of underlining otherness, but it's perhaps also a \"fuck you\" at The Man--what The Man then saw as stigma, I will trumpet from the hilltops!  You know:  taking an attempt at marginalization and turning it on its head, marking it a mark of pride.\n\nThere are other reasons--Irish- and Scottish-American identities can be...complex.  Yeah.  Let's leave it as \"complex.\"  Sometimes cultural groups were isolated and homogeneous so a sense of identity beyond \"American\" developed.  Sometimes...it makes life a little more interesting to have and celebrate cultural links beyond suburbia, y'know?  \n\nJust spitballing here.\n\nAnyway, I am a Scandinavian-American:  its just like being a regular, mainstream American but better.  Because it just is (uff da!) :)",
            "I was born in Taiwan, I speak, read and write Mandarin fluently alongside English, my legal name is in Chinese... but when people ask me where I'm from, I say Canada. \n\nI grew up in Canada. My cultural identity is Canadian. I drink like a Canadian, I talk like a Canadian. I say \"sorry\" often like a Canadian (heh). \n\nI don't recall ever being categorized to this degree by people until recently; and funnily enough, it was by Chinese people. \n\nI was in the wedding party for a Chinese friend. Me and all the other bridemaids were of Chinese origin. We were all chatting, and the bride said she was adopting her husband's last name (he has a French last name). \n\nThe girls were MORTIFIED. Taking your husband's last name is \"not done\" in China, or Taiwan. Women from that culture associate it with losing our identity. \n\nSo when one of them asked, \"Who gave you that idea??\" The bride pointed to me, \"JustWords--she took her husband's last name!\" (My husband is Australian, and their family name is Scottish). \n\nThe looks these girls gave me. I never felt so shamed for adopting a name. The bridesmaid who asked the question then went on to ask me \"why in the world\" I would willingly do that. She made me feel like I was a \"race-betrayer\". \n\nTo be honest, I do things for my own reasons. Taking my husband's name was important to his family, and it was also important to me. Having grown up in Canada, I felt that sharing a name with your husband was truly showing that you are now part of the same family. I don't feel like I've \"left\" my own family--I felt like our families just melded together. \n\nI make these choices based on what makes me happy, and what would make the people I love happy. The idea that I would be openly judged by anyone for this decision baffled me. \n\nI mean... even my mother, who asked me if I would change my name, was respectful about it. She was upset that I was going to, but she said she understood and respected it. My mom even went through the effort of learning how to pronounce my new name (she's not good at English) properly. \n\nSo it really threw me that I was being judged like this by people from MY GENERATION. If this type of snobbery came from an old Chinese person, I'd understand--that they have solidified their point of view and have a hard time changing it.\n\nWhen I read your post about how your husband's actions made you feel like you had to be ashamed for choosing to identify with American culture, that's what it reminded me of. I just assume people who are our generation would be less ignorant about these things.\n\nI'm glad everything worked out for you! ",

So stop shoving this idea that people are married to their ancestors' culture down people's throats because it creates yet another barrier when it comes to integration.\n\nI agree with this wholeheartedly and want to share an anecdote from my life. I'm white American, many generations deep. I love Indian culture, went there to study abroad, minored in South Asian studies, etc. One of my best friends from college is ethnically Indian, born in India and moved here as a child and raised in NYC. However she never mentions anything about Indian culture, and I noticed this very early in the friendship so I don't try to talk to her about Indian culture. It's just not something she's super interested in. She has other interests, like the Yankees. I figured it out early, and that was that... I never classified that as \"good\" or \"bad\" it's just who she is, and that's fine. As long as she's happy doing what she does, our friendship has lots of other aspects and her ethnicity doesn't define her to me.",
            "Your story reminds me of mine a lot. I am white and American. My wife is Indian but moved to the States when she was two. She became a citizen when she was 18 and has always identified more with her American upbringing. We did a Hindu wedding that was kind of a fusion ceremony, but then we also did a Catholic wedding for my side of the family.\n\nI've been in your fiance's position where I would say things that come across as insensitive just because I don't have the vocabulary for how to speak about it. It also comes up a lot because my stupid redneck family sometimes say things that can be construed as racially insensitive although they are not being malicious. I swear to god, my elderly mother probably still has to double check how to spell my wife's name. And my family always seems to forget that she doesn't eat beef, and it's always a big ordeal finding something she can eat at the last minute. \"She doesn't eat pork, right?\" Give me a break, people. \n\nAs it turns out, sometimes people don't even know that they're being insensitive or thoughtless. It's always a learning opportunity for everyone, and for the most part, people want to learn to be better to avoid hurting someone they sincerely care about. \n\nImportant thing is to continue doing what you did here, which is to be patient, explain the issue, and come up with a plan for how you might resolve similar issues if they ever come up in the future. There will be difficult issues that come up in wedding planning, raising children, choosing whether the kids will be introduced to religion and if so which one, etc. Just make sure the lines of communication stay open, everyone keeps an open heart and mind, and don't harden yourself if people make an occasional mistake.",

Once they learn I'm Mexican they compliment me on my fluent, accent-less English as if I'm supposed to add the words \"ese\" and \"holmes\" to every sentence.\n\nHappy to see that your fiance is realizing his mistakes and open to educating himself a bit more.

What does it take for \"minorities\" to lose the hyphenation? If your family has been here for 200 years, and 10 generations, are you still African-American, Asian-American, Mexican-American?

Turns out your dress will be white (or close to white) because of Queen Victoria of England, your bridal party is for protection from spirits, bachelor parties came from Sparta, etc. I suppose the mixing of everything makes it American because we are a country of immigrants, but it's mostly European because we borrow little, if anything, from cultures in Africa, Asia, or even from Native American traditions.

How can you honestly, *legitimately* NOT know that \"white people are the only REAL Americans\" is an incredibly ignorant and racist sentiment in 2015? \n\nLike, I totally understand why he might think you would want an Indian wedding or something. I understand why the conversation about your personal identity needs to happen. Just like getting to know someone in every other context, understanding how they identify is an important thing to talk about. So he's not wrong or bad for not knowing how attached or not-attached you are to Indian culture. \n\nBut how can you seriously, actually NOT understand that \"white people\" =/= \"american\"? Like when you said \"Are we going to have beer steins?\" and he was utterly BAFFLED, he literally had no idea what you could possibly be talking about. \n\nHonestly, I just....I had to read that line over and over again. I was raised in a very white-washed, privileged community. I never knew any black kids, the only Mexicans I knew were \"workers\". I never had any gay friends or knew anyone gay. \n\nI went to exclusive private schools where the parents drove Maseratis and Rolls Royces. My best friend's first car was a BMW when we were 16. All three of my closest friends had plastic surgery before 20. Most kids in my high school got Porches and Mercedes to drive on their 16th birthdays. The only \"minorities\" that broke into our community were the incredibly rich--offspring of politicians, athletes, or other prominent community members. So we are talking, super homogeneous, privileged, shelter little bubble world of white people and white values. That is how I grew up.\n\n  But like I still understand--deeply, deeply understand--that \"whiteness\" does not define who is an \"American\". \n\nI'm just having a hard time understanding. We live in the age of the internet, when Facebook is inundated with gay/gender/race soapboxing CONSTANTLY, I feel like we live in an onslaught of perspectives about this...how has he never ever in his life ever been presented with these ideas???? \n\nI get the whole \"my middle class upbringing\" copout, but being middle class doesn't replace your brain. My friends in high school had entire WINGS of houses to themselves. Their parents were millionaires. I can count on my hands how many non-white kids we had in our school. And it is still considered an OBVIOUS FACT that white people aren't the only \"Real\" Americans. Has he never read a book?\n\nI went on kind of a rant. I'm sure he's a nice guy. But that was an incredibly, incredibly stupid ignorant inexcusable thing to say and I hope he takes some more initiative in understanding racial/ethnic/national identity more after this. Because holy shit. My brain melted a little when I read his excuses.",
            "I just want to say that before when your fiance was harping on the Indian wedding, he was just unaware that your culture is American culture. You were born in America, English is your mother tongue, you know what region of India your grandparents live in, you watch the same crappy reality TV any American watches. That's American. My best friends is Taiwanese. His father was the first sibling to come to America, and the family has slowly been bringing my best friend's aunts and uncles over one household at a time. My friend's dad speaks little English, but my friend and his brother are native English speakers, they speak Mandarin with their parents but need to constantly review it for their own sakes. Their mother cooks Chinese food every night (really though, it is just food, boiled eggs and fish, veggies), and they have a low opinion of Mao. That's all. I would say the family is, umm, \"very in touch with their roots,\" being that they are the first gen children of immigrants, but that whole family is American. They buy their cars at dealerships, the kids/cousins all play video games like me, one kid will do drugs and go to EDM shows, the whole family watches fireworks on July 4^th . American. Just because your grandfather didn't fight for the Yanks in WWII does not mean you aren't American. ",
            "Perhaps the stupidest post I have ever read. You got mad at him for trying to adhere to any culture differences you may have had, and call him racist. There are people who would be offended at people NOT doing this.",
            "A perfect Bollywood ending. ;)",
            "Great! I would say make sure your kids have a tiny taste of both your cultures though and encourage them to explore their background while making sure they know how you feel though.",
            "> I also told him, albeit a bit more jokingly, that I wouldn't be making him any rohti \n\nWell why the hell not? That shit is delicious, and as working with an indian taught me, fairly easy. ",
            "From the way you talk you seem like a model of integration (you and your parents of course). I wish more people would be that way. If you decide to go to another country, integration is key. You can't hold on to all your old traditions and values, unless you really don't want to be a part of that culture and rather remain with your \"old\" culture. It's cool if you can mix it up, but I see a lot of immigrants here who do not accept their new country as the new norm, won't even learn the language, so I wonder what the fuck they're even doing here. Instead they are creating ghettos, nothing more.",
            "Only one correction, hes not Caucasian because I doubt hes from the caucus isles.\n\nEDIT: Caucus Mountains as I was corrected.\n\nEDIT: By all means keep down voting, not liking what I said makes it no less true. You cant change a fact.",

            "I'd postpone the wedding if I were you. Sure, he said some nice things, but I'd need to see him actually prove it with his actions before I could think of marrying him. ",
            "All I'm seeing is a bunch of cry babies because their white husbands have more privilege than them. \"You don't know what's it like!\" Well fuck if you cared to have someone relate to you you would've married someone in your position. Wouldn't have to be the same race. It could be another minority but you wanted the white guy with privilege who is the standard for all other men to live up to in this country. How is he supposed to ever understand what you think. He doesn't. He's just nodding his head because he doesn't want to fight. You guys want to be equal with whites? Ha! Segregation happens in nature. You're only equal among your own. To them you're just the token exotic girl who's so cut off from her race that she has to ride white people's coat tails. They feel sorry for you!",
            "I honestly pity you for continuing a relationship with a racist. Just because he won't say these things out loud doesn't mean he doesn't still think that way about you. ",
            "Yup your fianc\u00e9 is a classic closet racist And this is without question a huge red flag. But this is /r/relationships so as long as he's not beating you it's not a problem. Good luck op!",
            "I'm glad this all worked out in such a feel-good family movie kind of way, but I suggest postponing the marriage a year, or at least until you two have a big angry fight of some kind. I'm not saying you should trap or goad him into one but latent racism like this doesn't evaporate in the face of logic. I predict that unless you perform this figurative biopsy one day you two will be arguing and something will slip out and of course he'll apologize profusely afterwards but you'll realize that deep down he still harbours prejudice."
