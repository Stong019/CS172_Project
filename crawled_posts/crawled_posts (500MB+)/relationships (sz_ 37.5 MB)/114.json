The response to my manic posting on reddit has been overwhelming and I wanted to say thank you. Almost every reply was saying that I should leave him and the relationship was no good. So on Christmas eve I packed a bag and I left. I'm currently staying with my sister, sleeping on her sofa and for the first time in my life, I feel free. Thank you for everything reddit.\n\nTldr: I took some advice from fellow redditors and left my boyfriend",

I myself have mental health problems and while it has caused some problems in my marriage and my husband has gotten stressed he has never cheated on me because of it. That has to be the latest excuse ever. Your man sounded like a narcissist cheater and that had nothing to do with you! I hope you find a good guy one day. Having mental health problems can be hard in a relationship, especially for the party without it but it does not make them treat you like trash even if it is hard for them to understand like my husband. My husband may get stressed and not understanding but he is still there for me and loving me. Not cheating on me and blaming me.\n\nI hope the best for you in 2021!",

        "selftext": "TLDR: Located my Dad, I'm with him in the hospital. He has serious brain damage from a \"fall\". I don't think he fell but what do I know. \n\n[Link to Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/INlQ1AbeN3)\n\nHi everyone. I wanted to wait until I had more information to post an update, but a lot of people were seriously worried about my Dad and I, so I wanted to let everyone know what happened. \n\nI finally found my Dad. My Uncle took him to the hospital the night of the incident, and was (for reasons I'll get to) ignoring our calls and texts. Anyone who bet on head injury and drugs, you're correct. You can cash out your chips at the front counter haha. There was no second family. I wish there was. My Dad would just be in drama-related trouble and not medical trouble. He's got a massive concussion and serious brain damage. Doctors don't know how he managed to even drive to my apartment safely. They think he was on autopilot, since he takes that freeway nearly every day. The phantom kids are his coworkers. His brain somehow blended the details of his coworkers life into his own. Coworker has a daughter who is married and has two kids, and the memories of being told about \"the girls\" mashed together with memories of his own daughter. Doctor says this is pretty common with head injuries. \n\nMy Uncle *did* find my Dad and take him to the hospital. He did drive out to my area and scour the place looking for my Dad, and eventually found his car outside Walmart around 10pm. Couldn't find him outside, but did find him out behind the building, harassing an employee for a cigarette. He grabbed my Dad and kind of dragged him into the car and took him to the hospital. He just decided not to update anyone because \"He didn't want to stress us out\". I don't believe him at all. I think my Uncle is responsible for what happened to my Dad and was avoiding us out of guilt. \n\nAfter I posted here, I went to work and once I was clocked out I went to my Dad/Uncle's place. Dad and Uncle's cars were gone, only my Aunt's was there. I went and knocked but nobody answered. People in my last post mentioned carbon monoxide poisoning and I was kind of freaking out thinking my Aunt was just fucking dead inside, so I went around the house testing the doors and windows to see if I could get in. The back door was unlocked so I just let myself inside and looked around. Totally empty. I even checked underneath the beds since a couple people mentioned my Dad could be paranoid or scared and hiding. My aunt has this giant purse and it wasn't there, which confirmed to me that she was probably with my Uncle. I went back and sat in my car and started calling any hospitals and jails that came up on Google Maps. Nobody had any answers and just said he wasn't there. \n\nI even called the cops for a wellness check just to see if maybe THEY could call around hospitals and get a different answer, but I waited until 11pmish and literally nobody came. No police, no family, nobody. I drive back home and try to get some sleep. Next day I call out of work and spend the day driving around my area trying to find my Dad. Couldn't track him down so I start calling hospitals again. There's three in my area and while two of them gave me \"No, he's not here, sorry\" one of them got really nervous over the phone and said \"I'm not supposed to give out patient information.\" I got SUSPICIOUS. Kept asking and she just got more and more flustered. Hung up and drove my ass over there, and saw my Uncles car in the parking lot. It was kind of late, the sun was down but I wasn't keeping track of time, so there were only like 5 cars in the visitor area and his was one of them. I do not have words to describe what I was feeling, but it was mostly just rage. Like what the fuck? Hello? He's been here the WHOLE TIME?? \n\nI went in and tried to get the receptionist to let me see my Dad. She didn't really want to let me, and I'm not proud of it, but I started freaking out. I slammed my hands on the desk, screamed, knocked over a magazine rack. I guess my tantrum made someone go talk to my Uncle and Aunt since she came out to the waiting room and told the receptionist it was fine to let me through. If she didn't look so tired and sad I was going to maul her, but the look on her face made me \"calm down\" (if you can call it that). Long story short, she took me to my Dad's room. He looked terrible. None of you know my Dad, but he's a beast. He's 5'11 with massive smile lines and bright, shining eyes. He's my Dad so I'm biased, but he's always so full of life. Laying in that hospital bed, he looked dead already. Sunken eyes, lifeless and droopy face. He looked empty. I was able to talk to him for a bit but he was totally out of it. He had to be reminded who I was several times and kept forgetting where he was and why he was here. \n\nJust like my Dad, when I get upset, I get angry. I practically dragged my Uncle out of the room and into the hallway for an explanation. After like 20 minutes of him making excuses and beating around the bush (another reason I think he's guilty) he told me what happened. Apparently Monday morning, my Dad \"fell\" getting out of his car and cracked his head really hard against the driveway. He got up and everyone thought he was fine, so they just went inside the house as normal. After a while he \"had a headache\" so they gave him \"a couple\" prescription pain killers to ease the pain. Apparently that worked so they just let him continue his day as normal. They only got concerned when I called and told my Uncle what happened. He kept being so weird and evasive that I know there's more, but I couldn't wring his stupid fucking neck in the hospital hallway so I just let it go. \n\nHere's what I think happened. I know my Uncle and Dad, and I know the history of this stupid family like the back of my hands. I think my Dad and Uncle got in a fight over something, and Dad was either pushed down or hit in the head by my Uncle. The altercation gets resolved somehow and they go back to normal, but my Dad's head still hurts. I learned AT THE HOSPITAL FROM THE DOCTOR that there were enough painkillers in his body to numb a horse, so I suspect my aunt and uncle just kept feeding him painkillers so they wouldn't need to take my Dad to the hospital and admit what they did. I pressed my Aunt about the painkillers and she eventually halfway admitted that they weren't exactly allowed to have them at all, I suspect she bought them off someone else. They're likely addicted and I just didn't know. \n\nI'm almost 100% sure this is their fault. If they had taken my Dad to the hospital as soon as he hit his head, he would probably be okay. I'm staying at the hospital now and my Aunt and Uncle have left. Doctor says to \"not get my hopes up\" about my Dad. But when doctors say that, it always means he'll actually be okay right? That's how it always goes. They tell you that your family member probably won't make it but they always prove them wrong. I'm sorry, but the rest of this is just going to be venting. \n\nYou know what really gets me? I could handle all this, I could understand it. My Uncle and Aunt have always been less than reliable. I can believe that this could come from them. The hardest part is the lack of concern from literally anyone but me. I had to blackmail my brother (drama from a year ago) to even get him to agree to fly out. My mom doesn't care. Dad's family doesn't care. My sister kind of cares but she doesn't really want to help, or even come support me in the hospital with him. I am just so shocked that I'm the only motherfucker here for my Dad, and he doesn't even know who I am right now. I have to take time off work but it's not like my job gives me PTO. I'm fucked. My dad is fucked. My life is fucked. WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE DEALING WITH THIS?? My brother is the only one of us with time and money to help fix this and I had to THREATEN HIM just to get him to come back home. I wish I had chased my Dad when he left my apartment. I was afraid of him but I'm even more afraid now. My Dad is probably going to die and I trusted the jackass who killed him with helping him. Whats wrong with me. Whats wrong with everyone. Why doesn't anyone give a shit about my Dad. Why doesn't anyone give a shit about me. \n\nI could have been a better daughter to him. I could have visited more, called more, involved him in things more. I could have chased him when he left my apartment. I might have gotten hurt but I would rather be beaten to a pulp rather than be sitting in a hospital room with my unconscious and probably dying father. I'm so fucking stupid. I'm sorry Dad. ",

But it is the reality of the situation -- it might be you and only you with some minimal support here and there. And stop beating yourself up about how you handled your dad. You did more than what many, many would have done in your situation. And you did the best you could with the limited information you had. \n\nYou're uncle and aunt, however, are some real POSs.

            "Deeper breath OP. You didn't do anything wrong. The decisions you made in the moment were the best ones you could *at the time*. Hindsight is 20/20. \n\nRight now you are doing EXACTLY what you should be doing. \n\nI empathize with you greatly. There's a lot of things that happened decades ago with my dad that made me blistering mad with my mother (his wife). More recently my husband had horrific health issues which landed him in the hospital with very low prognosis. \n\nI had to mentally and emotionally prepare for the worse case scenario while holding out hope for best case. It's overwhelming and can feel like slowly drowning in quicksand  \n\nMy advice: \n\nPack over night bags, slippers, carry your soap to the hospital. 3/4 nights spend with your dad (it'll alleviate your fears). (Every other night works!) Go to work. You have bills to pay. Make sure the hospital has a direct route of connecting you. \n\nCheck with your jobs HR. See if they offer any medical paid leave for sick/ailing family. Check to see if your state offers paid leave for illness (some states have enacted laws that offer FMLA but paid!). Talk to the hospital social worker or patient liason. They can help a LOT. \n\n*sending strength* you can build a community within the hospital network so you can help yourself and your dad. \n\nMy thoughts are with you.",

If he dies, you\u2019ll be heading into the process of dealing with his estate, what condition it\u2019s in, is there a will\u2026 funerals are expensive.\n\nI\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t what you want to hear, especially while you\u2019re keeping your dad company, but the more actions you can take while he\u2019s alive the better. If there\u2019s money in bank accounts that you can access try to do so. Call an attorney if you have friends who work in the field. If you mobilize now, it\u2019ll be easier later.\n\nAlso, call the cops on your uncle. As his daughter, you are next of kin in most jurisdictions, you need to maintain control for your dad\u2019s sake.",
            "Traumatic Brain Injury or TBI, not concussion.\n\nYour dad will have problems going forward if he fell and clunked his head on the driveway; I slipped on our icy driveway about ten years ago. I'm going to tell you my symptoms, so you are aware of what your dad could/will be going through. I'm in my 50s (female).\n\nImmediately afterwards, the head hurts, like a bad headache. Then after a few days, the brain just doesn't really want to function as much.\n\nLIMIT YOUR DAD'S SCREEN TIME! And I really mean that. Seriously, the best thing for your dad is to sleep and rest his brain for the next 3 to 6 months (or longer). Sleep is the only thing that will heal his brain.\n\nI recently learned about the supplement NAC for TBI's, ask your dad's doctor about that. It's an over the counter supplement, there's really no harm in taking the recommended dose, but see if the Dr suggests a higher dose.\n\n\"Screen\" time can also include music, podcasts, visitors, reading; anything besides sleeping and staring out the window, lol. I could drive okay, but couldn't handle the car radio being on.\n\nAfter the first month of lots of napping, then I could handle being on the computer for about an hour at a time, then a nap. I switched to tv for about an hour, then a nap. Reading for an hour, then a nap. Going outside and pulling weeds in my garden, or going for a walk was better, but I still needed a nap afterwards.\n\nI had a slight continuous headache for about the first six months, then it turned into a weird sensation - you know if you are upside down and you feel the blood pressure in your head that is uncomfortable? That's what my head felt like for months seven and eight.\n\nTo this day I have trouble finding the word(s) that I want to use. During my healing I remember the most frustrating was I could not think of the word for \"police station\" when I was talking to my adult son. I had to explain, \"the place that cops go after work to eat donuts\". To this day, I still have trouble with getting the word I want to say, and it's \\*extremely frustrating\\*!!  Going forward with your dad, if he has trouble getting his words out, be patient, do not joke about getting old, or \"having Alzheimer's\"; the joking makes it worse.\n\nMake sure your dad doesn't do any fast head movements. For me with my long hair, I'm used to flinging my head down after my shower to wrap my hair in a towel. I then began to realize that when I did that, I was re-injuring my brain and I would have a worse headache for several days afterwards.\n\nThe best description I can give about TBI is think of a bowl of jello as your brain. Initially it's all smooth and solid. Then take that bowl of jello and shake it furiously until it's all chunked up - that's what the brain is like afterwards. The smooth connections are broken, and it's \"loose\" in your skull.\n\nI am so glad that your dad is getting the care he needs right now. Make sure that he is being treated for a TBI, and also make sure everyone in the family gets educated on TBI's.",

She cracked her skull on the pavement and suffered some rather significant  brain damage as a result. \n\nI felt like shit, I felt like I caused her to fall of the bike, like my bickering somehow pushed her, like my sister and I caused this to happen. \n\nShe recovered, she's not 100% like she was before the accident, but over 12 years have passed since then and she's still my mom. It is fucking terrifying seeing a family member going through that. What you described with your dad having to be reminded of who you were multiple times -- I remember my mom having the same thing. I am so fucking sorry OP, I am sorry you have to go through this and that your family is being so detached from the whole situation. \n\nI can't say what'll happen, I don't think anyone can, but I hope to god you're alright and Dad pulls through. Don't blame yourself and don't give up.",
            "OP I\u2019m really sorry for what you\u2019re going through. I just came to comment a couple of things.\n\nFirst of all, I know on some level you probably know this, but NONE OF THIS IS YOUR FAULT. This didn\u2019t happen because you were a bad daughter or because you didn\u2019t chase your dad down. This happened because your dad was injured and his brother chose to give him sketchy medication instead of taking care of him. That\u2019s not on you. I know it\u2019s human nature to think of all the ways things could have gone differently but you are NOT RESPONSIBLE for what has happened.\n\nSecond, is it possible that the rest of the family just\u2026 doesn\u2019t understand how serious this is? You mentioned there\u2019s a lot of family drama around your dad, I\u2019m wondering if they just think \u201coh Thomas is being Thomas again\u201d (random name, if it\u2019s his actual name it\u2019s a coincidence!) Denial is often the first reaction to a tragedy. Kudos to you for being able to be present for your dad.\n\nThird, I second what others have said. Get in touch with the hospital social worker and see what their recommendations are, see if you can find out if your dad has an advance care directive and who is named as his healthcare proxy. \n\nFinally, remember to breathe. Whatever happens is largely out of your hands, which sucks, I know. Just take it one thing at a time and remember to be kind to yourself.",

            "My father in law suffered a similar situation. He had brain damage from a fall which then either accelerated or caused his Alzheimer\u2019s (that we didn\u2019t know about\u2014 thought it was dementia and apparently it\u2019s important to know the difference). My husband had to stop working to care for him. He was the only one strong enough to contain him when he got stubborn and violent. This was a kind, loving man who nearly punched his own beloved daughter because she denied him something (food related I think). At night, we locked him into his master bedroom to keep us all safe (he would do very dangerous things), but he would spend a good part of the night trying to break out. In the 2 years we lived under the same roof, my husband aged a decade. We moved out with my husband still going over to give about 14 hours of care and he died soon afterward after he was taken to emergency for stomach pains though that\u2019s another story.\n\nI tell you all this because you need to know that even if your father lives, he may be gone. Please do not make the error my in-laws made of trying to do it themselves. If not for my husband, there\u2019s no way they could have handled him and even with my husband\u2019s intense help, this was a 3 person job. They got no help from their very large extended family, mostly because everyone talks about how painful it was to see him like that.

If you ever want an understanding, judgement free ear, or for some reason you ever have the urge to vent to a random @$$ stranger from reddit, feel free to message me \ud83d\ude04\n\nWhen I was a teen, a car hit my dad as he was running across the street. He was badly injured and hospitalized, and one of his injuries was head trauma. He didn't know who the hell I was. He didn't even know who or how old he was at times. He was scared & confused. Like you, I was the only person who showed up. Watching your dad change from the big, goofy, loving person you always knew into a lost, angry, terrified stranger, is a horribly gut-wrenching feeling I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy & my heart goes out to you. \n\nI obviously dont know for sure, but my guess is when you started asking him questions, he got so angry because he was embarrassed. In his mind, he was doing something nice for you, so when you started questioning him, he didn't understand why. He probably started realizing he wasn't making sense, felt embarrassed, and lashed out because he's your dad. Even though you aren't a little girl anymore, dads are supposed to be superheroes to their kids. He has the answers to all your questions, can fix all your broken things, he is the strongest man alive, and he is the fastest person in the world. Then he is standing in front of you, and all of a sudden, he isn't any of those things. \n\nHe was probably scared you now see him as helpless and incapable. He may have seen your expression change from happily surprised he was there, to a mixture of pity and concern. The lashing out in anger was probably just a defense mechanism because he felt stupid, so he was projecting his fears onto you.\n\nA lot of people have a hard time putting their ego to the side for a second and admitting they might be missing something, or they could be wrong. (I am probably guilty of this too) That's probably all that was. He felt stupid, so he yelled at you as if you were doing something on purpose to make him look stupid. When you backed up (which you DO NOT need to feel bad about), he switched to yelling about that. First, you try to make me look stupid, and now you are being ridiculous, acting like you are scared of me when I'm only mad because you tried to make me look dumb.\n\nI know it's easier said than done, but please don't be so hard on yourself. You didn't do anything wrong. It could have been so much worse had you reacted to what he was saying instead of racking your brain to figure out how, and where he got these pieces, and why he was trying to put them into the wrong puzzle. \n\nI think you are 100% right about your uncle trying to brush it off because he wanted it to go away. He might have even noticed your dad wasn't getting better, but still ignored it because how do you explain to the cops or hospital you fought, he got hurt, you kept feeding him pills, and ignoring the fact he needed medical attention even though you knew damn well he needed it.\n\n Like, oh shit. I messed up, and I'm already this deep. The only option now is to keep digging. He pretty much gave himself away by dodging your calls and refusing to tell you what was going on. If all he did was go looking for him, found him, then took him to the hospital because you were worried about him, then there is zero reason to avoid you. \n\nI hope you and your dad will be okay, that he will recover, and everything will work out for both of you.... along with everyone else on here.",

            "Why are you the one that feels responsible for your father here when no one else does? I agree with everyone else that you should be calling the police, but it feels like you are lighting yourself on fire to keep everyone else warm. Why does your father live with your aunt and uncle?\n\nYou need to talk to the police about your aunt and uncle pumping him with painkillers. You need to talk to a lawyer about getting designated as the medical power of attorney. Get your aunt and uncle banned from visiting your dad. You need to talk to your brother and find out what his hesitation is about dealing with this. Start working with him instead of fighting everyone every step of the way. Do not take PTO, if you can\u2019t be there with your dad then you can\u2019t be there. Your father made choices like letting his anger direct his life (which you seem to be following along in his path) and has made choices that left him in this situation.

I would also check to make sure they don\u2019t have access to any money that is his or listed as anyone that would receive money in the event of his passing. \n\nA head injury is so serious and the fact that they never contacted you when you were practically calling every hour that\u2019s a huge red flag.

I am so sorry you and your Dad are going through this. \n\nFrom experience I can tell you it would be better for your sanity to just tell yourself your siblings are out of the picture. This will only add to your frustration. If they need to know something they are adults and they can take the initiative and find out for themselves. If they call you don't guilt yourself into answering if you don't feel like it. I hope it gets better for you both, I really do hope your Dad pulls through and makes a recovery.

        "selftext": "This is going to be quite the wall of text, so feel free to jump down to the tl;dr.\n\nSo in the past month my older brother's fiancee left him. This meant he lost his house because the home they lived in was in her name. He lost his vehicle because what he was driving was her old car. He also lost his job because he was so focused on his breakup that he was constantly making mistakes. He moved in with our parents who live about 5 minutes away from my husband and I.\n\nI DO have a lot of sympathy for him. He literally has nothing, no home, no car, no job, no relationship. The problem is, this is third time this has happened to him. That's right, he has had 3 fiancees leave him now and every time he winds up losing everything. He has had two cars impounded because he gets so upset over his breakups he loses his job and can't make payments on his vehicles. My parents and I have bailed him out of these situations every time. I even paid off his back payments on his car, paid for his dog's vet bills, AND paid some of his rent before. My parents and I have literally spent thousands of dollars trying to 'help' him. Each of the past two times he winds up moving back in with my parents who are in their late 60s.\n\nWhile we pay for everything for him whenever he goes through a breakup he becomes a total jerk. He spends every weekend with his friends out camping or vacationing (how he pays for it I have no idea, after the second fiancee he took a trip to Fiji with his friends but couldn't afford to pay his rent). He mostly ignores me unless he needs money, which, during this breakup I am refusing to help him out at all. The worst part is he treats my parents like garbage. If they ask him questions like, \"have you been looking for a job?\" he will yell at them. He has no problem eating the food they provide for him and living in their house rent and utility free, and driving my mom's brand new car (which she got because he totaled her last car) but makes them absolutely miserable. My mom told me he will yell at them, call her stupid, trashes their house, sleeps all day, and leaves the care of his dog up to them. Every time I see my mom lately it's obvious that she's been crying.\n\nThe most recent event took place on Sunday. In an attempt to get him out of the house for a while I offered to take him out in our boat. He seemed super excited about it and when he's excited he can actually be a lot of fun to be around. He tells me he's hanging out with friends but will be back in town Sunday afternoon. Sunday afternoon rolls around and he's nowhere to be seen. I get a text around 6pm that he's decided to go to a local tourist destination with all his friends, they are going to tube down a river. I'm bummed because I was honestly looking forward to it and because my brother has once again chosen his friends over his family. But it's whatever, I honestly don't rely on him for anything so it's not that big of deal. But then I find out he's driving my mom's car and she has to be in her office early Monday morning. Then the peaceful protests in our town turn into full on riots and my brother is still not home. At this point he can't get home because they've blocked off access to our town so he just stays with his friends and I wind up taking my mom to work. My Dad tries to talk to my brother on Monday about how irresponsible he was and my brother just yells at him and then locks himself in my parents basement for the rest of the day.\n\nMy parents are miserable. They want to help and have always said they will do anything for us kids, but they are just enabling my brother every time they bail him out. My Dad has major health problems that are being exacerbated by the stress my brother is causing. My mom has a history of severe depression that I see her slipping back into the longer my brother is with them. I'm really close to my parents and they are usually very fun people. The longer my brother stays with them I am seeing them become depressed, short-tempered, and miserable. I tried telling them to kick him out, one of his friends would surely take him in, but they insist that they don't want to leave him homeless. I can't convince them to kick them out but is there anything else I can say or do that might get my brother to get his head out his ass and get a job? How can I get my brother to see his behavior towards my parents is unacceptable?\n\nIt just sucks, I used to really look up to my older brother because he is outgoing and funny and the sort of person everyone just gravitates towards. Now I'm just pissed at him for how he treats my parents and simultaneously scared for his mental health because he clearly has a lot of problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr Older brother lost his fiancee, house, car, and job. My parents took him in and he is now treating them like garbage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\* Thank you for the responses. A couple of things: I am in no position to psychoanalyze my brother or parents, but I do believe that mental health is a primary reason for how any human acts the way they do and clearly my brother's mental health is not good. I am encouraging my family to see therapists, but decided I will not be paying for my brother's because there is truly no telling if he would go or be willing to change. Also, my mom works for a not-for-profit for the elderly and specializes in elderly abuse cases. She told me that she knows what he is doing is 'technically' elder abuse, but she does not want to report it or want me to report it. If things get any worse though, I will go behind her back. \n\nI went to my parents house last night for an unrelated reason and had a brief talk with my brother that devolved into a shouting match. I started by showing him four different jobs I found online that he could apply for, but none of them were 'good enough' for him. He was 'insulted' that I thought he would work those jobs and that's when the shouting match started. I'm an educator, I KNOW I shouldn't have let myself get into a power struggle with him, but siblings just know how to push your buttons, you know?\n\nANYWAY, I was able to talk to my mom one on one and she is totally unwilling to do anything about him. She will not even give him a deadline of when he has to have a job, nor will she stop lending him her car. She also reiterated how miserable she is in her own home with him around, but insists she's feels so bad for him she doesn't want to force him to do anything. \n\nSo I told her that I am done with him, and I will not be spending any time at their house as long as they continue to let him drain them of their health, finances, and mental well-being. I told her she and Dad are welcome at my house any time, but my brother is not. I have to tell you, I have never felt like a shittier person, it's not in my nature to just give up on people. ",

            "It\u2019s not a mistake that these women keep leaving him. I\u2019m guessing mooches off them too until they break up. Your will not change until he faces consequences for his actions and you and your parents stop enabling him. He\u2019s almost 40 and behaving like a teenager. That\u2019s appalling but you can\u2019t fix him.",
            "Hm is he really losing these things? Or is he mooching off his partners and losing the gravy train when they inevitably leave? I find it hard to believe he actually builds any sort of security with these women when his clear default is to lean on others and do little. Maybe he works when he\u2019s with them but clearly he\u2019s not saving or building a thing. You don\u2019t just lose your vehicle.",
            "Your parents have created a monster by allowing this kind of behavior - and you've been a part of it too, by bailing him out time and time again. He's had no incentive to change how he behaves, because they've made it clear that they'll accept whatever behavior from him, no matter how shitty, and they'll keep pushing cash and support his way.\n\nYour parents need to understand this, and to have just a slight hope of making them understand, you're going to have to be really blunt. That means you're going to have to tell them that *they* are just as much of a problem as he is. If they want to \"help\", then they can give him $300 or whatever it'd cost to pay for a weeklong stay at a dirt-cheap residential motel. He's a grown man and he can manage if he wants to manage. All they're doing is prolonging his adolescence. If they're worried about him being cold, they can buy him a sleeping bag. If they're worried about him being hungry, they can buy him a 25-lb bag of rice and a pot.",
            "My husband's cousin was exactly the same way. His mother always took him back to live with her.\n\nNothing changed her mind, even when his behaviour was dreadful. He was just her \"poor troubled boy\".\n\nShe blamed his ex wife and girlfriends for most of his issues. \n\nIt wasn't until she went to the house of his latest much younger girlfriend who had just kicked him out for beating her up, that she saw the girls bruises and it finally clicked that her son was not the victim.\n\nShe finally told him he needed to leave, and he managed, by mooching off others and spending a lot of time in jail for aggression and alcohol related charges.\n\nApparently Canadian jail is nice, he tells me. Spends time playing chess with the old- timers.\n\nHis parents both died shortly afterwards, and he didn't bother to get involved with funeral plans ect. Just wanted his share of any money.\n\nHe got it, spent it, he's still living, but estranged from his family. Don't wait too long to confront your brother with your parents, or he'll ruin their lives just as my husband's cousin did to his.",
            "For a start, you need to STOP giving him money. You cannot control your parents but you must stop enabling him. No more money.",
            "Did you carry on giving him money after he went to Fiji but couldn't pay rent? It's crystal clear that he has no respect for any of you.",
            "This:\n\n> they are just enabling my brother every time they bail him out. \n\nAnd you were doing the same, but it seems you have wised up.\n\nYour brother is immature and irresponsible.  I say that not to condemn him but to summarize succinctly.  He also has major problems with mood.  He should be seeing a therapist and possibly also be on meds.\n\nSo should your mom, while we're on that subject.\n\nAs long as they let him come home after one of his colossal failures, they are subjecting themselves to the stress.  You can't really prevent that.  But in future, remind them from time to time that brother shouldn't be living in girlfriend's house and driving her vehicle because when it goes bust (which it always does), he'll be right back on their doorstep, unless they address it with him in advance.",
            "The problem is you and your parents enabling him. They have to kick him out on their own free will. I know it sucks, but you can't force your parents to make that decision.\n\nJust believe that when they had enough they will act.",
            "I don\u2019t really see a reason for your brother to stop doing this behavior. There hasn\u2019t seemed to be any real consequences. He is clearly a con man not \u201ccould have been an old timer con man.\u201d He IS a con man. You might not know about all his cons but it seems pretty clear with what you\u2019ve posted here. \n\nWhat I can say is that you, yourself need to a top supporting this behavior. You\u2019re parents may never stop supporting it. I have an uncle who \u201ccould never do wrong\u201d and my grandparents have been supporting him and now his son for his entire life. No one can explain to them that they shouldn\u2019t just keep throwing money and things at my uncle. Your brother will find another woman to drain and more then likely he may actually be the one leaving these women when the well drys up and they run out of money and then just getting sympathy points by saying that they left him. \n\nYou\u2019re best option is to talk to your parents, but don\u2019t get your hopes up. It\u2019s hard to cut off manipulating people like this since it\u2019s been their life work to manipulate people into doing what they want. \n\nGood luck and stop wasting money on this guy.",
            "Call your states version of adult protective services. Report your brother for elder abuse, because what he is doing is elder abuse.\n\nHe is yelling at your parents to the point they don\u2019t like being at home. Taking their car and not bringing it back. Even though your mom needs it for work. And he is having them pay for everything, while he is being an emotionally/ verbally abusive jerk. Let the state step in and kick him out and give him a reality check.\n\nThen you, and any other family members need to come together and cut your brother off. No more money, no more trips, no more couches to sleep on, no more contact. Your brother is a mooch plain and simple. He is a grown man who can care for himself but he has learned its easier to use people than to take care of himself. Stop feeding into this mindset, brake the cycle.",
            "There's not much *you* can do, other than talk to your parents about not enabling him anymore. And I see you've already tried that.\n\nIt sounds cold-hearted, but this is between your brother and your parents. He's treating them badly, he's mooching off their kind nature, and they're letting him treat them however he wants. You try to convince them to enact some consequences for his behavior, but they're saying *\"No, I don't want to change this\"*. Until they're ready to enact consequences for his bad behavior, this is how it will be. \n\nI hesitate to use the words \"stop meddling\" and \"it's none of your business\", because you care about them very much and would like for your brother to fix his shit and your parents to be happy. But you don't have any **power** to intervene. These are choices your parents are **choosing** to make, and you can't force them to make different ones (even though these choices they're making are hurting themselves) All you can do is wait for one of them to change the situation on their own.  You can lend your parents an ear, you can continue to suggest they kick him out and hope they come around, but as for what you can **do**, all you can do is stay out of it and look out for yourself. Maybe remind them that if they kick him out he'll survive, and that they're enabling his behavior, but that they have the choice for what kind of life they're living, and they can make the choice to change it if they want to.\n\n(When I say \"look out for yourself\" I mean they'd totally take you in if you were in trouble, but they don't have to because you've got your own self covered. They don't have to worry about you. You're not adding to their burden. You're a source of emotional support instead, a positive force in their lives.)",
            "Sounds like it's time to vote the asshole off the island and let one of his friends take him in. At his age it's likely that simply talking to him won't change his behavior. On a side not it might be time to have to retirement and estate planning talk with your parents. Not to squeeze him out but to make sure he's not taking advantage of them or blocking their ability to retire.",
            "Tough as it may be, you ALL have to cut him off. Kick him out, stop paying his expenses, force him to be self-sufficient. He doesn\u2019t learn because everyone keeps saving him from the consequences. I know how hard this is for your parents - my parents do the same with me and my siblings (though we all make mistakes of varying degrees of severity), but we have to learn on our own. He\u2019s an adult. His behavior is essentially rewarded, because parents (and even you) always come to the rescue. This will keep happening until everyone stops.",
            "sorry to victim blame but your parents have enabled his bad behavior for so long there is NO WAY this guy comes around on his own. \n\nIt is never too late for tough love!\n\nHide the car keys from him and change the locks next time he leaves!",
            "Op, I'm speaking as someone who had to convince my mother to kick my brother out and cut him off. What you're describing--a manipulative man taking advantage of emotionally compromised older adults--is elder abuse. It is almost impossible, however, to convince parents to see the ms elves as victims of abuse from their children. They often can't help but see themselves as authority figures in control who are giving a wayward child some slack and the abuser will take advantage of those emotional ties and confusion as to who is in control of the dynamic. Here is what you can ask your parents to do; they helped my mother see herself as a victim of abuse and take action in support of her safety and happiness:\n\n1. Have them make a list of all the  ways your brother has wronged them over the years. Abusers like to overload their victims with the latest crisis; a list can create distance and establish a pattern of behavior. \n2. Call often and force the issue. \"Mom, dad, I think you're being abused and manipulated. You need to cut brother off.\"\n3. Have them imagine what their life would look like without brother in it\n4. Make a plan for how they will in cutting him off. How will they tell him? Who will be with them? How will they answer the questions and accusations he will likely have as he attempts to browbeat them into letting him stay? \n5. Have a plan in place for how long he has to pack his things, after which--if he's forgotten anything or is unable to move it--you yourself will deliver it wherever he wants. \n7. Insist that their priority is their happiness and safety now: he is an adult, he has friends, he has the demonstrated skills to find a new job and housing, he's done this before. He is an adult, questions like \"where will he go?\" Are his problem, not theirs. Their questions should be \"how do I keep myself safe and happy?\"\n8. If you don't already live in town, offer to stay with then yourself after he moves out. He will try to contact them and manipulate then into letting him back. They will need your support to stay strong: someone around who can calm them down and enforce the  new contact limits. \n9. Activate their support network! Your parents might feel ashamed at their predicament, like they've failed their child and deserve what's happening to them. You know that your brother is taking advantage of them. Other people can see it too. Abusers rely on isolation to make their victims feel crazy; tell trusted friends and family what's going on so they can back you up in the above. \n\nIt's one of the most difficult tasks in the world to override a parent's drive to care for their child. If you can get then to start asking practical questions about how kicking him out would work, you've won the hard battle but they'll be relying on you for followup because theyll be ready to backslide at the slightest provocation. You're faced with an opponent who knows your parents' weak spots and has everything to gain from manipulating them; my mom is still in a cycle of reapproachment with my brother, who physically threatened and stole from her. It takes the strength of an outside observer to remind them that they deserve happiness and to show them how to fight for and protect it. Good luck and please feel free to message me if you want to talk further.",
            "Your parents are adults.  They can make their own decisions.\n\nAnd until they decide to let him fly out of the nest on his own, he will keep coming back and fouling their nest.",
            "Your parents are enablers.\n\nI don\u2019t see that changing. You can stop contributing. Stop trying to \u201chelp\u201d your brother. It doesn't help. It makes him weaker.\n\nHe also sounds like there\u2019s a decent chance he\u2019s dealing with some level of mental illness. Depression, bipolar, BPD- he needs someone professional to diagnose him. That likely won\u2019t happen as long as he is being enabled.\n\nYou can attempt family therapy with your parents, just the three of you. To talk about their enabling of him, and how what they perceive as \u201chelp\u201d is actually harm. That may or may not change them. You vs. also talk about how this hurts You, and you might need to distance yourself from them as a result.\n\nUltimately, you have no control over any of this. They can choose to continue to enable, and he can choose to be enabled. All you can do is enforce your own boundaries about how much time you spend with any of them.",
            "I wish I had some better advice cause I have a brother who sounds very similar to yours. Things started to change once he had kids, but not completely. My mom didn\u2019t stop bailing him out whenever he asked until she lost her job and could no longer afford the rent for her house where she lived with him and his wife and kids. I moved her in with me and he and his family found a new place. They are getting by though he still asks to borrow money occasionally (that he doesn\u2019t pay back) though my mom has gotten better about saying no as she\u2019s on a fixed income now. \n\nShe blew through all her retirement accounts before she lost her job (because she spent it helping him) except for a pension from an old job that she couldn\u2019t draw from early. Not too long before she moved in with me, the pension got cashed out. She actually decided to NOT tell him she was getting this money knowing he would ask to borrow until it was gone. This was a HUGE thing for her to decide to do and follow through on and I think that had a lot to do with the fact that she had sort of hit rock bottom herself. \n\nMy brother rarely talks to me unless he wants to ask me for something. I never lent him money and he stopped asking me years ago because he knew I was a dry well as far as he was concerned. That\u2019s what you have to be for people like this though. They can take care of themselves, but won\u2019t as long as they can draw for free from someone else. They will take and take until you stop giving. \n\nYou can make that decision for yourself much easier than your parents. They are clearly not ready to cut him off. My mom would complain all the time and I\u2019d tell her to cut him off and she wouldn\u2019t. She just wouldn\u2019t until she couldn\u2019t. \n\nI think you should try to have a sort of intervention with your parents where you sit down with them (without him around) and lay it out for them\u2014his pattern, his behavior towards them, etc.\u2014and try to get them to see how it\u2019s hurting them and that he\u2019s not going to stop until they stop letting him. They need to set some hard boundaries and let him go. Kick him out if necessary. Once you\u2019ve talked with them, either they will do that or they won\u2019t, but you need to absolve yourself of feeling like that is your responsibility anymore. They are adults, too. If they want to help him at their own personal and financial expense, you can\u2019t stop them.",
            "I agree with everyone else that is time for brother to start taking care of himself. You don't want to have to wait until he finds the next girl to shack up with. Your parents should give him two to three months to get a job and move out. Give him a specific date that he has to be out of the house by. Two or three months is a reasonable amount of time to find a job and secure some sort of living arrangement.",
            "you're all enabling him. look up codependency. your help is not helping. time to let him sink or swim.",
            "While I can see why you'd blame your brother for making your parents miserable, your parents are the ones with the power and making the decisions to put them in this situation.  No one can control your brother, and as this is now round 3 of the same thing, wishing he would control himself seems like an exercise in futility.  You're correct to identify your parents as enablers, because they are.  If they really valued their home, privacy, space, and comfort over their son's comfort, nothing is stopping them from making that choice.\n\nI think your best bet is to keep reminding your parents that kicking him out is the only realistic solution, while also refusing to shoulder any of the financial, emotional, or time burden of dealing with choices, as that is just more enabling.",
            "As a parent of grown children myself, I feel so much for your mom and dad.  We care so much about our children but then have so little control of who they turn out to be.  My son had about three years in his early thirties where he lost his way and developed a drug problem, it was devastating.  It still is, in a way, he is doing well now but he'll never get back what he lost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, they must know they are enabling him.  I don't know that he is actually an addict, but they need to treat him the same as they would an addict in the sense of \"release with love.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is not going to be possible to \"make him understand\" what's wrong with what he's doing.  He will never get better as long as they continue to accommodate him.  The only way for this to change is for them to throw him out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey can do this gently -- buy him a cheap used car, or put the security deposit and first month's rent on a studio apartment, or something like that to help him get set up -- but they *have* to cut him loose.  They certainly don't owe him that, but if they feel it's too much to just put him on the street, that sort of approach might make them feel better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe may still not get better, some people never do.  It's heartbreaking, but subjecting yourself to financial and emotional abuse doesn't help anyone.  He may be able to charm another woman into looking after him, although he doesn't offer the usual benefits of dating an older man -- financial security, emotional maturity -- so he will find it harder and harder to find girls to lure into this type of relationship.",
            "Listen, you're enabling the enablers. \n\nThis is going to be though to hear, but I bet this is the way you feel attempting to tell this to your parents. \n\nYou can't \"reason\" people in an enabling cycle out of it. You have to show them. It sucks ball, but I think a stern talk is in order, one where you tell them that, you feel for them and love them greatly, but you're no longer willing to \"share the load\" that your brother is imposing on them, because ultimately, it's their choice to continue enabling him, and you don't think you're doing them any favours by making it easier for them to continue to do that. Draw the direct parallel between what you're doing and what they're doing. \n\nAnd then do it. Don't drive your mother to work when your brother takes her car. Don't talk to them any more frequently than you otherwise would if your brother weren't in the picture. Don't respond sympathetically (but do so *empathetically*) when they complain about him and the grief he's causing them. Don't help them out economically in any way. \n\nYour parents may not deserve what they're getting, but they absolutely are allowing it to happen. And they're adults as well, even if you see them as these frail old people who can't do any better. If their moral compass won't allow them to do what's ultimately good for your brother in order to save him some short-term griefs, that's 100% their choice to make, and they should face the consequences fully. I bet this dynamic didn't start when your brother was an adult.",
            "My brother is EXACTLY like this.  He's also 36.\n\nGrowing up, he ruled our household.  My parents had no control over him, but they also could not punish him because he'd just ignore it.  And he still got whatever he wanted from them whenever he got too deep in trouble.  They helped him out to the point that he got a guitar for Christmas one year, and a couple years later, I wanted a guitar, too.  For Christmas that year, they bought his guitar off him for $400, and gave it to me as a gift.  He just came in my room and took it back.  That's how much they enabled and spoiled him.\n\nHe would leave me at school when he was my ride.  I would chase behind him as he'd drive off in the 1968 mustang my parents bought him when he was 15.\n\nSame story with women.  He moved back in with my parents in his late 20s after a breakup, and worked for my dad.  My mom was diagnosed with cancer and for 1 1/2 years of her chemo, he did not take her to a single doctor's appointment, or come along with us.  Instead, he screamed at my dad for not buying milk when my parents lived 1/2 block behind a grocery store.\n\nAs my mom was dying, she completely began to reject him, and would say things to me like, \"There's something wrong with him.  I don't know how you turned out the way you did.  It couldn't have been our fault, because you turned out normal.\"  Truthfully, all I did was see my parents suffering and told myself I would do everything the opposite of my brother.  \n\nAfter she died, he became enraged that my dad was dogsitting for his new girlfriend, and threw the dog against the fence.  My dad called the police when he took my mom's ashes and stood in the street screaming that he didn't deserve to have them.  All the neighbors came outside and he mocked and antagonized the police.  When they asked if my dad wanted him arrested, he said no.\n\nMy dad used to tell me the only way he would be able to get my brother to move out would be to have him removed by police.  \n\nWhen he got married and moved off, finally working a job where my dad wasn't his boss, he lost the job within a year due to drinking.  His work even offered to pay for his rehab, but he refused.  Then he lost his wife.  Then when moving for a new job, he flipped the Uhaul toting his car when he drove off the highway while having a withdrawal seizure.  My dad drove across multiple states to retrieve him from a rural hospital where they called saying he'd been brought in and medically detoxed, but he was causing a scene and refusing to leave the lobby, and that they were going to call the police.\n\nWithin a week of my dad helping him and getting him moved, he'd bought a new car, and drunkenly rear-ended a woman on a Thursday.  He missed his first day of work at his new job because he was in jail.  They told him not to bother coming in, ever.\n\nHe got another job.  Recently he's lost that one due to drinking.  He has a breathalyzer on his vehicle.  My dad will drive 3 hours just to bring him groceries.  He refuses to apply for unemployment, go to therapy, go to rehab, or do anything, really.  He calls my dad and whines until my dad gives in.  \n\nI have tried off and on to have a decent relationship with my brother, but it always ends with my mental health suffering.  My relationship with him sounds different than yours, though.  He's not charming with a ton of friends.  He is belittling, demeaning, and overall very cruel.\n\nI remember once he came in my room super excited to show me something, getting me hyped up and excited, too.  Telling me to \"follow him\", we ended in the bathroom where he pointed at me in the mirror and started picking off the things he thought were ugly about me.  He constantly called me stupid and told me I have no common sense.  \n\nMy advice is to ask yourself how this makes YOU feel.  You're rightfully concerned about your parents, but how are you doing?  It took me a really long time to learn that I'm allowed a voice when I grew up without one, tiptoeing around an explosive nightmare.  I sat down with my dad and asked him to listen to me while I told him what it felt like growing up for me.  He told me he had no idea, that I always was able to lift myself out of bad times, while my brother wasn't able.  I explained that I needed my parents, as well, but in different ways, and that I hid it from them because I saw how hard it was for them to deal with my brother.  I asked him to stop enabling my brother.  I got him to go to al-anon meetings with me.  I told him to never give my brother money again.  I told him what he's done has led my brother here.  Which is the truth.  I told him I believe my brother's behavior contributed to my mom becoming sick.  And that he learned he could manipulate and do what he wants because he never faced real consequences.\n\nI told my dad I was angry at him for not listening to me when I was younger.  Because I did speak up when I was so scared one morning on the way to school, he was so fucked up that he drove up the curb and didn't realize it.  I jumped out the car and ran home.  Locked myself in the only room that locked in our house and called my dad.  He was banging on the door so hard I thought he was going to kill me.  The next morning, he was so nice to me and brought me orange juice as I was getting ready for school.  I thought it was different, but very nice he was making up by being nice.  Turns out, he'd just crumbled a xanax in the orange juice.  My friends had to carry me to the nurse's office, and my mom came to pick me up.  \n\nI'm 32, I haven't spoken to my brother in 2 years.  My dad is afraid he will end up homeless, but he's finally coming around to understanding that he's enabled him for decades, and he can't do anything if my brother doesn't want to do anything for himself first.\n\nBeing blunt and honest with my dad, and letting my dad see that I have more sides to me than the peacekeeper, do-gooder side I maintained for years to keep our house balanced helped A LOT.  To express to my dad I was angry with him and my mom for enabling my brother helped A LOT.  Because my dad didn't see me being emotionally affected, he did not realize things were as bad as they were.  It also validated his feelings, and helped him see he can start letting go of someone that's hurt so many people who have only tried to help him.  \n\nI wish I had better advice than this, but it's all about letting someone who fails on their own not be rescued by a tribe he wouldn't show up for in the same ways if the situation were reversed.",
            "My brother in law was very much like this.  Entitled and selfish.\n\nIn the end, he called adult protective services (trying to get my sister in law removed...long story there!!).  The social worker talked to my mother in law a lot and well, she ended up helping my mother in law file to evict him.\n\nI don\u2019t know if your parents are old enough to be covered under this, but it may be a wake up call to them that this is where they are headed.

            "This seems to be an epidemic with men. My ex fianc\u00e9 was this way. Proposed immediately after 5 months of dating I guess to trap him as his supplier. I forced him to get a full time job, gave him a time limit to buy a car or I breaking up with him because sharing my car was getting to be so stressful I wasn't getting enough sleep to keep up with both of our schedules and it didn't help on my one day off he totaled my car in which case I forced him to pay for the deductible. He went through 4 jobs the last was a good, salary job but he messed that one up too. Our wedding was four months away the day he lost his job. I just broke down and told him I couldn't live this life anymore. He added so much more work and stress to my psyche I couldn't handle it. I'm glad I never married him and feel bad for the woman he married SIX MONTHS after we broke up. She was a single mother so I can see her rush but boy... Last I heard, the three were homeless begging mutual friends to let them stay with them. But it's seriously the consequences of being an irresponsible adult.",
            "this is exactly the future I see for my fiance's brother. he's almost 30 now. lives at home with his parents (60s and retired). he has NEVER had a job for longer than a month. he has been in and out of school - he's got a bachelor's and was going for law school until he \"took a leave of absence\". \n\nanyway, he shows no motivation. makes his parents provide everything...most recent, he's requested they live in the basement while he takes over their master suite upstairs...of course they complied. everyone tip toes around him and keeps enabling him. my fiance and I stopped the enabling on our part a while ago. now that he knows he can't get what he wants from us, he's non existent in our lives. which is great for me but man I feel bad for his parents. but also not really, they enable him and have let it get this bad. \n\nhe somehow gets girlfriends but eventually, like any sensible person, they want more from a partner and he is unwilling to provide so they leave. it will be interesting to see what their lives become as his parents age and aren't able to provide and cater to his every need. \n\nadvice for you and your husband, keep firm boundaries. don't isolate yourselves from your family (I tried with his family) but also don't give in and enable. keep a balance. unfortunately, there is no changing him. he needs to fall on his ass and face consequences. I hope this happens to my fiance's brother. as harsh as that sounds...he will be better of because of it.",
            "Idk if you can do anything here... I left a guy just like that. We were actually living with his parents and as if that isn't humbling enough, he would demand the car, cigarettes, beer $ etc from them... Never ask. He would throw temper tantrums, there were holes in every wall, all the windows were cracked and his door... He just propped it up against a wall bc he'd beaten it off it's hinges so many times...\n\nHe was fully aware of how he was too bc when he majorly f-d up and totalled the car, he'd be screaming at his parents for giving him a hard time about it before they even opened their mouths.\n\nHe hit his dad, \"accidentally\" hit his mom once, and neither of his siblings would speak to him and his nieces and nephews were scared of him. \n\nMy daughter lived with us too and we went to pick her up from a friend's house. The mom took one look at me (he and i had been fighting the whole way to pick her up) and asked if I'd rather let her stay another night... And everything just clicked. \n\nI could tell it deep in my heart that my daughter was better off where she was, without me, as long as I was with him. I realized the situation was very close to becoming a CPS issue and in my heart of hearts I couldn't deny that I was endangering her the longer we stayed in that home. But I had nowhere else to go. \n\nThat night I let her stay at her friends and i packed our bags for the women's shelter. He tried to take my keys, he tried to take my phone, his mom had to keep him from attacking me (he hadn't actually hit me before) and his dad helped me load the car... \n\nI still think about his parents and mourn that they are trapped by their love for him... If they'd just let the cops pick him up on his next drunken temper tantrum... Or the next time he threatens suicide, he might be able to get the psychiatric help that I'm convinced he needs...\n\nHis parents are such good people and so are yours. They're not alone. \n\nMaybe it's time to sit them down and watch some intervention reruns or something so they know that the isolation they're feeling is self imposed. \n\nPart of the vicious cycle is constantly trying to hide it from your neighbors and loved ones. You probably don't even know the worst thing your brother has done bc they're too trapped in their own situation to realize that being truthful doesn't mean they're betraying him.",

It's pathetic.\n\n>I used to really look up to my older brother because he is outgoing and  funny and the sort of person everyone just gravitates towards\n\nThat is textbook narcissistic behavior. They are only good to people who can do something for them, as soon as you stop being useful or question them at all, they lash out. This is also a tactic people use to emotionally manipulate loved ones.\n\nIt's okay to feel that your bro is not a good person. I still don't know how to navigate my own family dynamic.

My parents had no idea how to deal with my brother and their interactions would constantly leave them upset and depressed because he just did whatever he felt like. He would blow off special dinners or disrupt my parents at 3 am because he just had to shower at that time. He completely ruined his first marriage in about a year and is just an all around not great person. But after I showed my mom some techniques about gray rocking and stuff about how he's a narc she can spend time with him on her terms and no longer gets as depressed because she understands why he's acting a certain way and how to deal with it.

            "Sounds like parasitic narcissism to me. Look into it. It\u2019s not a very well documented or studied form of narcissism but that\u2019s what it sounds like to me as someone whose sibling is suspected to have it. His therapist suggested the diagnosis, but he\u2019d need to see a psych for an official diagnosis.\n\nYou\u2019re probably familiar with narcissism, but parasitic narcissism tends to manifest in a way that the person feels they are above performing \u201cnormal\u201d behaviors such as paying rent, making car payments, cleaning the house, going on boring vacations etc...\n\nSo they usually lean on manipulation to leach resources from others, usually family members or a partner/spouse. This probably explains why his life seems to fall apart at the end of a relationship.\n\nFianc\u00e9e leaves him because she\u2019s sick of him using her money, car etc... \n\nShe\u2019s been witnessing this all along, but now it\u2019s obvious to others because now he\u2019s living with mom and dad and has lost everything. He can also use the \u201cIve lost everything\u201d card to his advantage to get your family to provide his needs, while he pursues his wants.\n\nMy brother is only 22 and has been pulling this bullshit with my parents for years. When he was a kid he was always a very talkative happy kid, but noticeably good at talking himself out of things.\n\nOne example, is once my mom chaperoned a school event where his kindergarten class did crafts. My brother walked around the table telling everyone how good their craft projects looked and how his would never look that good until a girl agreed to do his for him... this was a fucking five year old...\n\nMore recently: \n\n1. Got himself + me kicked off our parents insurance a few years back for having 10+ speeding tickets and 3 at fault accidents (I had one \u201cat fault\u201d accident caused by me suffering a medical incident behind the wheel... yes it\u2019s illegal for the police to declare you at fault in that situation, but in my state insurance can still declare you at fault)\n\n2. Totaled his car in an accident. Talked my dad into buying him a brand new, that year Ford Focus. He totaled it a week later...threw a huge fit about how unfair it was that my dad was going to make him pay it off after the accident and ended up talking my dad into buying him a junker\n\n3. Thinks he can go to music school with no musical experience outside of having played percussion in band in 5th grade\n\n4. He cannot keep a job. He will work for a couple months, then quit because \u201che\u2019s too good for that kind of work\u201d then go a few months mooching off my parents until he finds another job.\n\n5. Throws huge fits of rage when my parents ask him to smoke weed outside of the house. He says it\u2019s \u201chis house too he can do whatever he wants\u201d\n\nAlong that line, he believes anything in the home belongs to him. He once sold my bass and amp to a friend while I was away at college because \u201cit\u2019s his house too\u201d he also used to use my car without asking leaving it smelling like cigarette smoke and weed.\n\n6. He almost flunked out of college because he \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to prove that he\u2019s smart\u201d\n\nTherapy has helped him a lot, but he still says and does cringy and entitled stuff every now and again. He\u2019s not selling or stealing other peoples shit, he found a private spot in the woods nearby to smoke, he takes care of his car and tries in school... but his hot take is always something that sounds like \u201cI\u2019m too good for this, so I\u2019m not gonna do it\u2014you should do it for me\u201d\n\nYes\u2014sounds like spoiled brat syndrome but there\u2019s more to it than that and you might be able to attest. My parents raised me too and I can\u2019t understand what goes through my brothers head sometimes.\n\nHe\u2019s manipulative, and learned those tactics at a young age. He feels that\u2019s the best and only way to get through life.\n\nYour brother may need therapy. Based on what I understand about personality disorders like any kind of narcissism\u2014therapy is the best treatment, it won\u2019t solve everything but I have seen improvement from my brother. \n\nYour brother may at least benefit at this point in time to help him recover from his breakup. In the future he may benefit from couples counseling if he finds himself another fianc\u00e9e. \n\nBest case scenario he becomes aware of his own actions with therapy and he can warn partners and friends of his behavior and ask them to look out for him and let him know if it seems like he\u2019ll need to go back to therapy.",

            "Family intervention time. Get your parents on the same page that this cycle MUST be broken, help them come up with their lines in the sand and then sit down with your brother and lay out some hard reality. Ok, they don't want to kick him out right now, but unless they want this to just stay the same they have to come up with some impacts he will notice and be willing to follow through on it. They need to parent him.\n\nWhether your brother just has a really bad \"picker\" when it comes to women, or whether it's a flaw in his personality/behavior, something is clearly very wrong. He needs help, and he needs to accept that and do something. He needs therapy to put in the work on himself to either fix the type of women he picks or the flaws in him/behavior that are contributing to the breakdown of his relationships so traumatically.\n\nIf your parents won't do any of this to encourage him to go to therapy, then try and encourage them to go at least to a family therapist who can talk this through and coach them on how to handle him. \n\nAs mad as you are about this, fundamentally this is less a brother problem and more a problem with your parents. It's their house and if they don't want to put their feet down despite knowing his cycle is the cause of their problems then they're choosing to sit in that unpleasant stew. They're choosing to enable him. At some point, rather than trying to take on the job of trying to parent them, you may need to accept that your parents are choosing their unhappiness, and to some degree this is an indicator of why your brother is the way he is, their parenting style has an impact and this could be one of them.",

You do as well, it\u2019s easier said then done turning your back on family.\n\nUnfortunately, at 36, your brother will never change. Years of enabling, while good intentioned, have simply reinforced his selfish behavior. At his age, he should be a VP or director at a company. Instead he probably has a spotty employment record.\n\nThe fact that three completely different women have chosen not to marry him speaks volumes. There is no way you are going to be easily able to untangle him from your parents now. He has nowhere to go, and if you\u2019re parents have not cut him off by now they never will.\n\nThe simple fact is that some people are selfish and lazy. Period. There is no deeper reason. Some people choose a life of service or volunteer. Some people even lay down their life to save others. That means there are people out there the exact opposite.\n\nYour brother is destined for (and probably deserves) the lonely life of a bachelor or we will settle for someone (I imagine an equally selfish women with like three kids).\n\nThe best thing you can do is slowly distance yourself from him, don\u2019t do it all at once or he might just cause you drama. When he asks for money just feign your own money problems or say you need it for your kids.\n\nUnfortunately, your parents are going to suffer. I don\u2019t see how they can quickly move him out. He\u2019s used to the safety net they provide and it\u2019s hard for a loving parent to kick out a child, even if the child is a loser.

There appears to be some underlined issues that he isn't addressing causing him to become avoidant, aggressive and emotionally abusive. Also, his patterns of instability and lack of accountability in many areas in his life speaks volumes. I'm sure it's difficult witnessing your parents being mistreated and your brother's self destruction; however, your parents are going to have to set healthier boundaries and become more firm with your brother. I'm sure it'll be challenging for them because of the love they have for him; however, that's the only way. The enabling is only feeding and adding fuel to the negative behaviors. You sound like an amazing daughter and sister. Maybe encouraging your parents to seek therapy as well could be helpful, allowing you not to become triangulated in this situation. Your brother needs to realize he's capable and maybe he'd recognize that, if your parent's would finally say \"no\" to him...a little tough love never hurt anyone.

He will probably balk at treatment and that can be a condition of his staying with them. If he had slow cancer and they just kept him at home because he couldn\u2019t work, but also didn\u2019t demand that he get treatment, it would be considered more than what we think of as enabling.  I don\u2019t know if your bro will seek  a diagnosis  or help, but it might pave the way for your parents to understand that perennial-gap-year is actually detrimental. There\u2019s also an intervention-type wake-up-and-smell-the-coffee talk to have with them about how your bro could easily keep this up for another forty years and they absolutely can not.

Bring it up everyday and don't let it drop until they change. Don't get complacent. Don't stop even if they get mad. Absolutely don't get your brother out of the house to give them repreive. That only makes the situation more bearable for them. Let them get upset. Maybe they will finally get upset enough to take action.",

            "Your brother clearly has an antisocial personality disorder and likely other mental health issues.  You can't fix him.  Your parents can't fix him.  All you can do is stop trying, and cut off contact.  If your parents become miserable enough, they will do they same, but you can't do it for them.",
            "Wait.... He has no car, no house and no kindness... He leaches off people and becomes nasty to them, I don't think he deserves kindness at the moment because he needs tough love. He needs to get himself together and not rely on others to give him shelter or products when he can't be smart enough to realise how fortunate he is.",
            "Your parents have to cut him off. That's it, done. He has friends that can spend whole weekends with him, they have couches he can crash on. Sometimes loving someone means letting them learn harsh lessons.",

            "Your brother didn\u2019t \u201close\u201d anything. He\u2019s an opportunistic parasite that the primary hosts eventually managed to scrape off. Showing him sympathy for circumstances of his own creation isn\u2019t productive and even worse is giving him resources. \n\nHe his a charismatic person who uses that to create and exploit relationships. Being \u201cfun to be with\u201d is an asset, but not a core function of being an adult. Tell your brother you love him, nothing more. Stop enabling his self-destructive behavior.",
            "Has he been tested for ADHD?  He sounds like a perfect candidate - acts impulsively, hangs out with immature or younger people, unable to adult...\n\n\nMany doctors mistakenly think that you can't ADHD if you graduated from high school, but that's incorrect.  Check out CHADD or ADDA as organizations, or the r/ADHD on how to find a doctor who has experience looking for ADHD in adults. Ask friends for recommendations - you want someone who was tested and diagnosed as an adult. (Every doctor says they can test it, but if they use tests for 6 yr old boys, it's not a good test.)",
            "Need to kick his tail to the curb.\n\nAlas, if his parents won't do it ... well, you don't and can't control them.  Sure, you can support them, but don't be enabling the situation ... period.\n\nDo what you reasonably and appropriately can.

What that's telling me is that your brother is *absolutely useless* when it comes to anything more serious than fun dating -- which is bore out in his behaviour in other arenas too, always choosing his own feelings and fun over everything else.\n\nYou're right, your parents are just enabling him at this point. I'd focus on them rather than your brother. Be socratic and kind about it, but make the point that he's treating them like shit, and doing \"anything\" for the kids can sometimes mean being willing to let them stand on their own two feet.",
            "Omg this is freaking me out because I\u2019m in a similar situation with my brother (our ages almost match up exactly with yours too). Except my brother\u2019s wife left him and he\u2019s an addict. He can\u2019t keep a place to live because he blows his money, so he stays between my parents\u2019 places (they\u2019re divorced) and doesn\u2019t have to pay for anything. They bail him out ALL THE TIME. And then he gets his kids on the weekends and basically makes my parents take care of them because he just sleeps. \n\nIf you ever want to vent about your brother I\u2019m your girl lol",
            "Nothing you can do short of setting him up with his next mark. Why would he leave? He has it made. They are enabling him and if they won\u2019t kick him out, you can\u2019t force them to.",

            "The situation sucks. Your brother is not emotionally mature enough to handle issues and responsiblility. Let me guess, everything in his life is someone else's fault? Your brother is a narcisist. He needs therapy but that type obviously will not go . Because its not him. He is perfect. Your parents are stuck in a bad situation. They want to help their child but the issue is just that. They are helping him like a child. They need to put timelines on him. And rules. And then to make the tough choice for him to fend for himself if he fails. Its the only way he will learn. However, because of who he is, anything bad will now be your parent's fault in his mind even though it is his own doing. They will just have to live with that stigma.",
            "People will go to hell and back for people who are nice to them. Your brother isn't nice to your parents. They need to cut him off, kick him out and stop enabling him. Good luck convincing them of that though.",
            "Step 1) he needs to be single for a while \n\nStep 2) focus on his own personal happiness and development... family involvement, being more kind and empathetic to others, communication skills, relationship skills, read into romance and advice on these subjects... self help etc... \n\nStep 3) find his stability and independence without relying on a partner \n\nStep 4, optional) pursue dating and patiently finding the best match for his personality if he wants, have a mutually beneficial relationship",
            "If he has so many friends, your parents should kick him out and let them take care of him. He's never going to grow up, he's almost 40 and STILL acting like a child. You and your parents will be better off if you stop letting him run home to mom and dad everytime his choices and behaviors mess up his life.",
            "Literally sounds like my kids dad /:",
            "The brother just sounds like a bully tbh",
            "Have you tried reframing the discussion with your parents?  Its unlikely you can get your brother to change, but you can change the narrative.  Your parents are getting older and are poorly, have you talked to them about their retirement goals?  My grandparents sold their house and live in a apartment complex out in a rural are for retirees, which was pretty great because my cousin is the type to leech; now it's simply not possible.  If they're using up their savings helping him, remind them of their own goals and the fact that they aren't going to be a fall back for him forever.  I'd also bring up what could happen if he were to gain POA should their health decline further; would they trust that he would take care of them, or at least not drain their bank accounts?  They're in an increasingly vulnerable position it sounds like and I'd frame it that way.  Maybe help him pay for a deposit on an apartment and then move on with their lives and take care of themselves.",
            "Your parents and you need to stop enabling him. It\u2019s as simple as that.",
            "I and one of my brothers have displayed behavior similar to this and it turns out we both have Asperger's/high functioning autism. Maybe he needs a psyc eval",
            "It sounds like your parents are lovely people and they want to do anything they can to help him. However they cannot fix his life for him. That\u2019s his job and that\u2019s something only he can do if he chooses to do so. Right now, your parents are providing him with an environment where he does not feel the need to get his shit together. But it\u2019s not guaranteed that he will get his shit together if the comfortable life in the family home is taken away from him, it\u2019s just a factor contributing to his laziness. I think the best thing all of you can do is step back instead of waiting for him to step forward because you don\u2019t know how long that will take and you cannot sacrifice your mental health like that. I hope things get better for you, your parents and your brother. Good luck!",
            "Well, there's the problem. You're enabling him to continue to be the D-bag that he is which is hindering his growth and contributing to his multiple relationship failures. it's okay to let someone fail. Sometimes it's what's needed so that they can make that maturity growth needed to become a fully functioning adult.",
            "I agree with some others here, sounds like your brother might need a psychiatric evaluation. Armchair psychology is hardly ever helpful so I'm not going to make guesses on what he's got, but some of his behavior reminds me of certain personality disorders (difficulty regulating emotions and handle his life after breakups, reckless spending of money, emotions escalating from 0 to 100 in a second). His behavior definitely isn't regular. He might even be able to change something in his life with the proper treatment, if he has something. His ADHD you mentioned earlier in the thread really doesn't explain this kind of behavior.",
            "You can't fix him or your parents. I would have lots of advice for your parents (as I'm sure you do to) if they came asking - but clearly they want to continue to enable him, no matter how miserable he makes them. All you can do is protect yourself. Maybe if you cut him out of your life, your parents will see it is possible.",
            "Let him fall on his face for once. I (22f) have fallen in my face so many times, the only difference between your brother and me is my family didnt help finacially with anything. Nope only moral and emotional support which has made me into someone who takes care of everything myself and has helped my self esteem. The fact he becomes a jerk when you guys help him is proof he knows he can fuck up and it'll be ok because he has you guys as a safety net. Take away the safety net and make him survive on his own. A little tough love is what he needs and maybe he'll grow into someone a woman will find security in. If i a 22 yr old can support myself (in expensive california no less) then your 36 yr old brother can too.",
            "It is so hard to watch someone you love make horrible choices. That said, and I say this without judgment or mean-spiritedness (as I have been here before), you and your parents are his enablers, through and through.\n\nI'm going to say it again because I wish more people understood this because I think it would help them really ownership of their actions and help them realize THEY have more control than they realize:\n\nYou guys are his enablers. You guys are enabling him. You have a hand in this mess.\n\nNO person (such as your bro), IMO, can reach that level of dysfunction and chaos in their lives without being surrounded by enablers all along the way. You guys are not helping him. You clearly recognize this at this point, it's not like this is the first time this has happened. Now it's time to establish and COMMIT to boundaries. This will be uncomfortable, but unless you are willing to accept the role of being his enablers and bailing him out indefinitely, it is a must:\n\n1. do not give him any more money.\n2. do not give him any more money.\n3. if you must give him any more money, be clear that this is a \"once and final offer.\"\n4. your parents need to give him a firm move-out by date. they need to stick with this.\n5. release your attachment to the outcome. he is ultimately responsible for himself, and you can't control what he decides to do/whether he decides to grow, etc.\n6. research and learn about codependency (this is often a generational/lifelong thing, very tough to change but CAN be changed) \n\nGood luck, like I said I know how painful and frustrating it can be!\n\nEdit to add: if your parents are unwilling to stop enabling him, then be prepared to ALSO set some boundaries with your parents about this. \"Mom, Dad, I love you guys, but if you are unwilling to stop enabling brother's behavior then I will no longer be able to make space for you to complain about him to me.  I am simply not able to let people complain to me about things they are able but unwilling to change. it's not a good use of my energy and mental health.\" or something along those lines",
            "Dude all these women leave your brother because he treats them like shit. Stop enabling. Kicking him out the best thing that will ever happen to him. He will cry to one of his bros and let him move in and then turn it to a all time frat party.",

But if it was that, there is proven effective therapy that can help him live with it. I'm posting this here so OP has a better chance of seeing it.",
            "By allowing this to continue your parents are choosing to be miserable. They bail him out and give in to his tantrums every time.

I found out a few weeks later he was cheating and left me for her. I was devastated. I suffered from depression. All the plans we had for the future we thrown out from under me. I had to figure out what direction to go in and rebuild my life. I had two jobs and was getting my masters degree. Did I lose either job? No. Did I fail my masters classes? No. There is zero excuse for not being able to take care of yourself and your responsibilities. What if he had no family to support him? He would just become homeless? He sounds like he gets engaged very quickly because he wants a substitute parental figure because he can\u2019t take care of himself. That\u2019s his problem and you shouldn\u2019t have empathy for him. It\u2019s not even his first time. This is the THIRD fianc\u00e9 to end things with him. He should be more grateful his family puts up with his nonsense. Your parents should give him an ultimatum. Get a job. Get an apartment. And get out within 30 days. End of story. Also stop paying for him. You are enabling his behavior. He continues to be this way because he gets away with it everytime.",

He has based his self worth on the 'love' others give him, and he has defined 'love' as what they can do for him, and is creating a victim mentality for himself... Much like an addict, he has to shift his perspective, but as long as those around him continue to support/create the world around him the way he's always seen it, he will continue to behave in the same way.

Moving out will destroy the family relationship.  \n2. I am being selfish to think that I should be independent.  \n3. Im trying to abandon my culture and he an American.  \n4. Instead of paying money in rent I should be saving so we can all buy a house together. \n5. It is wrong for a girl to not stay with her family before marriage as it will damage my prospects. \n6. I should stay to fix the issues we have as a family. \n7. They need my financial support still. \n8. I will be leaving the spiritual covering of God from my parents and bad things will start happening to me. \n9. Other people will look down on me and the family. \n10. I am selfish. \n\nSo they have decided that since I can't break the lease,  my Aunty will start staying there ( in the apartment I payed for and furnished with my money) instead for the lease period while I stay home. \n\nHonestly I can't explain how horrible I feel. I feel like a bad child, a selfish person but I'm still going to move. If they stop speaking to me so be it. I've offered to visit every weekend but they said no, I have to stay with them till I marry. \n\nI will still try to offer some financial support when I can because I can't bear for them to struggle financially, but right now I am officially a black sheep, selfish daughter and who is causing family trouble.  I can't take the mind games anymore. \n\n\nEDIT: Thanks everyone for the support and advice given. I can see now that I made a mistake telling then before actually leaving but it was helpful to have that conversation with them, it has shown me that my independence and happiness is not as important to them as it is to me. Hopefully they will come around but for now I'm keeping my boundaries up. \n\nI have taken my documents and stuff from the house and completely moved to my apartment. \n\n\nTL:DR: I've told my parents I'm moving and they don't want me to leave so that I can keep living under their control and supporting them financially.",

It's not your actions that will have this effect.\n\n**2. I am being selfish to think that I should be independent.**\n\nI understand that this varies by culture, but it sounds like you're in the US. Independence is valued. It's not the same as selfishness. You can take care of yourself *and* (deserving) others. Currently you're only taking care of others.\n\n**3. Im trying to abandon my culture and he an American.**\n\nWell, if they didn't want you to be an American, they shouldn't have raised their family in the US. You have access to the best of both worlds, mix-and-match whichever works for you (not for them).\n\n**4. Instead of paying money in rent I should be saving so we can all buy a house together.**\n\nOh fuck no, what a nightmare. Do not tie yourselves to them like this financially.\n\n**5. It is wrong for a girl to not stay with her family before marriage as it will damage my prospects.**\n\nActually most US men will be more interested in a woman with her own place, who's lived on her own. Distance from your family will improve your prospects -- you'll become more self-assured and confident.\n\n**6. I should stay to fix the issues we have as a family.**\n\nThey don't want to fix any issues. They just want their maid back. To them, that *is* the only way to \"fix the issues\".\n\n**7. They need my financial support still.**\n\nThey *want* your financial support. You *need* your independence. Your needs are more important than their wants.\n\n**8. I will be leaving the spiritual covering of God from my parents and bad things will start happening to me.**\n\nWhat, your parents have some special \"in\" with God, and he'll just ignore you if you no longer live under their roof? Pfft.\n\n**9. Other people will look down on me and the family.**\n\nMost people will be proud of you for breaking free. Otherwise, who cares -- live your life for you, not based on what others will (allegedly) think of you.\n\n**10. I am selfish.**\n\nThe selfish party here is NOT you. It's your parents, who expect you to pick up after them and pay them for the privilege!!\n\nInstead of buying into their guilt-laden nonsense, I recommend you:\n\n* Move out as planned.\n* Do not give them keys to your apartment, even for a second. They will copy them and they will barge in and take over. Never let them even see the keys.\n* Preferably don't give them your address, unless their anger blows over. If they need to contact you, they can call or email. They don't need to come by and start interfering.\n* Believe in yourself. You are doing the right thing. They simply want to hold you back for their own benefit -- you are the only person in this scenario who can look out for you!",

You get the picture. \n\nNone of that mattered when I moved out. I got all the same excuses as you and my parents tried everything. It was painful but I dug my heels in and left. I was lucky because despite my parents best efforts, my younger siblings were on my side and it didn't affect our relationship. \n\nStay strong OP, this may sound impossible now but there is light at the end of the tunnel. You are not a bad daughter if you leave. You're not a bad person if you leave. People will talk, but they'll get over it. Trust me.",

Make sure all your financials are separate from them, and that they do not know your bank info. \n\nYour parents have no legal right to detain you or force you to live with them when you are 25. Your parents have no special relationship with any god that deems you now spiritually unworthy. No one in the US is going to look down on you for being an independent young woman who is financially responsible. Your parent's bad financial decisions are not your responsibility. They would not treat your brother this way. Anyone who would be a great partner to have in life is not going to be dissuaded by your decision. Any partner that insists you should remain under parental control until marriage is NOT a good partner. They are imposing a patriarchal bullshit level of control over you that 1) is not love it is control. and, 2) does not respect you as an individual with wants or needs or your agency. \n\n>Instead of paying money in rent I should be saving so we can all buy a house together.\n\nNo, no you certainly should not. OP, get into your new place and start looking for a counselor who is sensitive to immigrant issues specifically around the treatment of women as second class citizens. It may take a long time to get their negative voices out of your head, but you are actually doing yourself an amazing favor by starting at 25. In time, you will find the balance with your folks. They won't write you off altogether, even if they are angry for some time as you make this cultural shift that they will be forced to accept. \n\nCongratulations on your new place, and good luck!",

            "Well, don't feel bad. I think a lot of it is coming from their own uncertainty and insecurities. They are financially dependent, after all. It's totally fine for you to want independence and quite normal in western cultures. Frankly, it's not their decision to make and definitely not who lives in your apartment. Since you will still support them, you have the power: you can bind future payments to their acceptance, or they choose to cast you out and receive nothing. It might sound cruel, but it works both ways - for me in my culture their oppression and emotional blackmail sounds just as cruel. Don't be afraid to live the life you want! After all, that's what freedom is all about, right?",

I'm also guessing that they don't treat their son this way.\n\nLady, I'm from india, I know parents such as these, the only thing that works is for you to move out, otherwise they will keep guilt tripping and gaslighting you.

What you'll be doing is showing **to yourself** that you somehow \"owe\" them... for the privilege of having them abuse you. If you pay them ANYTHING, you're showing that their abuse WORKS, both to them and to yourself. \n\nPlease understand that if you do this, you'll be **paying them for abusing you.**\n\nSorry, but this is a situation where you need to cut them off utterly, no matter how painful it is. They will keep using you, over and over, until you stop them. **They will never stop hurting you, because they believe this is the right thing to do.** They truly believe that abusing their daughter is _correct action_, so they'll never stop abusing you. Why would they stop doing something they think is right? They think they're \"punishing the disobedience out of you\". \n\nYour brother will never be so abused. They're hurting you _because you are a woman_, and they believe it's acceptable. Your mother, in particular, is going to believe this partly because SHE was subjected to it - if she stops abusing you, she's admitting to herself that SHE was abused. That's why **you need to stop it yourself,** because she'll just double down and get worse.",

            "Don\u2019t feel bad or selfish. Your parents are narcissists and don\u2019t let them hide behind \u201cculture\u201d. Imagine you were instead raised by racist rednecks, would anyone give them a pass for their behavior because of their \u201cculture\u201d? Hell no.

            "You\u2019ve gotten a lot of advice already but I think lot of comments are reductive and missing the importance of family approval/unity in certain cultures. As an Asian American woman, I empathize with your situation. All the comments saying \u201cforget them, you\u2019re an adult\u201d etc. can feel impossible for those of us from cultures that are much more traditional than American culture.\n\nYour question is about finances, but I\u2019m gonna assume your family issues go beyond that. You sound very unhappy at home, and part of that is because your parents live by different norms and values than you. What you want out of your life is, to some degree, different from what they wanted out of theirs. And that\u2019s okay. \n\nYou feel terrible right now because setting and enforcing boundaries is HARD, particularly for people from traditional cultures. It\u2019s uncharted territory. I\u2019ve been setting boundaries with my mom for years and I still have difficulty enforcing them, because it feels like I\u2019m disrespecting/betraying her. But things won\u2019t get better until your parents understand that you DO have boundaries, limits, and needs. You are not bad, selfish, or a disgrace to your family because of them. You\u2019re human. It IS possible to pursue the life you want and have a relationship with your family - if that\u2019s what you want. But you can\u2019t do it without boundaries. Your parents will object, it may get ugly. Hopefully, they\u2019ll get used to it and learn to respect your boundaries. Realistically, that may or may not happen. And then you\u2019ll have to ask yourself what you\u2019re willing to compromise, what you\u2019re willing to tolerate, and what\u2019s a hard \u201cno\u201d for you. \n\nGoing back to finances, I can\u2019t tell you what to do but, here\u2019s what I\u2019d say: \u201cmy move out date is XX. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re unhappy with my decision and I understand where you\u2019re coming from. I appreciate your concern but I\u2019m 25yo and I\u2019m able to make my own decisions about my own life. This is the next step I need to take, and I hope you can eventually come to understand my reasoning.\u201d If you want to and are able to help them financially, inform them you\u2019ll give them XX amount for XX weeks or months. Don\u2019t agree to help for an indefinite amount of time. It\u2019ll be a tough, heated conversation and they\u2019ll likely bring up the points you listed in this post again. Don\u2019t get hooked or get swept up trying to defend yourself. Just say \u201cI don\u2019t agree\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about that right now with you.\u201d You can and should walk away if the conversation is too much, or unproductive and you\u2019re just talking in circles. It\u2019s going to be hard and you may feel really vulnerable, so I wish you the best and I\u2019m sending good vibes your way. But think of this as the first step in breaking the cycle of unhealthy and toxic patterns.",
            "I'm so glad to get an update from you and that you are on the way to escaping your abusive parents. I'm very concerned for you. I would really recommend therapy to learn how to set boundaries with your parents and uninstall all the familial guilt they have spent your lifetime installing. This is going to be a tough time for you. Stay strong - you have so much more value than as a slave for your family.",

What happens if you found a dude tomorrow and he married you in 6 months? They\u2019d still be screwed.\n\nTheir line of thinking is busted. You\u2019re not a slave to them.",

Even if you're alone without family in the new place, you're going to atleast be in a place where you can heal. Living at home is being somewhere where you are letting your family stab you. \n\nThey are adults. They need to figure out their own finances. It's not your responsibility!!!

            "I'm going to go through you mother's rant point by point, then add some other practical advice at the end.  This got really long.\n\n>Moving out will destroy the family relationship.\n\nThis will only destroy the relationship because THEY are destroying the relationship.  Most people with good relationships with their children and partners are happy to see their children grow and move on, content in that they prepared them for independence.\n\n>I am being selfish to think that I should be independent.\n\nYou are not selfish to want to be your own person, your mother is selfish to want you to continue to devote your life to her and give her money.  I'm sure money isn't the only thing she's used you for.  Are you her shoulder to cry on as well?  Her emotional crutch?  You should seek out a therapist after moving and examine the relationship you have with her.\n\n\n>Im trying to abandon my culture and he an American.\n\nI don't know what culture you are, and wouldn't know how to address this as I am an American, but I will say that there are plenty of people who still keep ties to their own culture while living in the US and adopting some of our culture.\n\n\n>Instead of paying money in rent I should be saving so we can all buy a \nhouse together.\n\nDo you want to buy a how with your parents and continue to support them financially and (I suspect) emotionally?  Who will be on the Mortgage and who will be paying the mortgage?  If the answers are you and them DON'T, you will be taking on a lot of risk if you can't fully afford it on your own.\n\n\n>It is wrong for a girl to not stay with her family before marriage as it will damage my prospects.\n\nSince it seems as though you're in the US, staying at home WILL hurt your prospects.  You won't come off as independent and I'm going to guess that your mother won't let you date who you want.  You are highly unlikely to find someone who is interested in a relationship with you AND your mother, because that is what is will be, she will (based on what you've written about here) be hovering over you at all times, and will drive a wedge between you and your future partner.\n>I should stay to fix the issues we have as a family.\n\nI'm willing to bet that she isn't willing to put in any effort or change any part of her behavior to fix the issues in your family.  She wants you to become her timid obedient slave girl and that will \"fix\" your family.  The only way your family issued get fixed if EVERYONE is willing to put in the effort, and your mother is not.  Remember the advice of the flight attendant \"put on your oxygen mask before helping others\", you cannot save someone else if you're in trouble yourself.\n>They need my financial support still.\n\nThey can get by, move to a smaller apartment, cheaper area, cut costs, have your aunt move in with them.  Your brother can do well and get into college even without an amazing school district, you've graduated college, you could even have him over and help him with is SAT/ACT test preps (as long as YOU have the time for it).  It's not on you to figure out your parents situation at their age, that's on them.\n>I will be leaving the spiritual covering of God from my parents and bad things will start happening to me.\n\nMany, many people have moved out without bad things happening to them.  Keep your wits about you, trust your gut (and your fear if anyone makes you afraid), and rely on good friends for help.  Most people in this world are good, and the world in most places (even the US despite news reports) is safer than it has ever been.\n\n>Other people will look down on me and the family.\n\nWho's going to look down on you for being independent at 25?  That's an admirable thing.\n\n>I am selfish.\n\nShe is selfish, this is projection.\n\nPractical advise: this is going to seem really harsh, but your mother's emotionally abusive behavior is making it necessary.  \n\nGet some friends together (if needed) and find a time when both your parents are out of the house and just move, don't tell your parents when you are doing this.  Don't answer the phone for them for at least a couple of weeks, if not at least a month, nothing they say will be helpful.  If you think you'll struggle with this block their numbers.  Block them on social media (or better yet just delete your FB).\n\nFind a therapist, if you don't know where to start, visit your General Practice doctor and ask for a referral.  If you don't have a GP, check who your insurance is (if you're still on your mother's, I'd recommend getting on your own through work asap) and find what organization is in your network, then call them as ask for a new-patient appointment.  Seriously, getting a therapist is one of the best decision I made last year.\n\nIf you haven't already told them where your apartment is located DON'T, if you have the keys to the apartment DON'T let your parents get them.  If your parent have gotten the keys get them back or inform your landlord that they were stolen and pay for it to be re-keyed.\n\nGet on your local subreddit or the meetup app/website and look for meetups, check event calendars in your area for things to do, look up fun classes in your area, just get out there and enjoy yourself.  Don't drink drinks that are handed to you by someone other than the bartender, tell a friend where you are going and who you are going with (as long as you know this), and when you're planning on being home.  Ask a stranger for help if you need it (safer than accepting help if offered).  You'll be fine and your parents can adapt, don't set yourself on fire to keep them warm.",
            "Stop \ud83d\udc4f giving \ud83d\udc4f them \ud83d\udc4f money. It is not your job to support them. They have to figure out how to support themselves.",
            "I want to reiterate what others are saying about making sure your family doesn't gain access to your new place (trying to get keys from the office, trying to make copies, etc.). Since it's very likely against your lease to let your aunt live there, don't let them bully you into adding her.\n\nI've struggled with guilt trips my parents gave me and it wasn't even on a 10th of the level of what you're going through - I cannot imagine how that feels. I know you still want to be there for them, but I would suggest taking a break any time the mind games get to be too much. You are not obligated to answer every phone call, you are not obligated to allow people over when you want/need time to yourself. The boundaries you want are healthy.",
            "Are you of Indian back ground? Damn this feels soo similar to my moving out story last year . Im Sorry to say this but the emotional abuse and blackmail won't stop even after you move out. I'm still dealing with that until now. Move out now instead of waiting later as something will happen suddenly that causes your moving out plan to be postpone. And best chance is to go for no contact. You will feel bad but it's more of a withdrawal syndrome from bad drugs. You deserve your own happiness. If your family can't deal with that then it's their problem not yours.",
            "If the aunt does anything to damage the rental place, it is legally in your name. Just sounds like they are trying to play you out to keep you stuck with them. I'm in my 20s too.

Value and treasure yourself.\n\nETA my cousin earns well and doesn't pay rent. His family can't make him. You only pay rent where you stay. Your parents are treating you like a maid. If your mother wanted rent paid while you liveD there, while you didn't work, she could have asked for help (within reason - not clean up after them) with some chores.\n\nETA2 if they are short on money, they should budget, not demand and trap you with lies to manipulate you into having lesser power.",
            "Let me set this thing straight. A parent SHOULD NEVER ASK A CHILD FOR MONEY much less demand if if them or make them feel like they are doing wrong by not providing it. It is a parent's job to support the child, not the other way around. You need to make sure your parents are informed of the government resources available to them and then cut them off. You are not a bad child. You are an amazing child for becoming self sufficient with parents who obviously are not.",

            "They're trying to guilt you into staying with them and supporting them through every possible means, don't let them. They don't seem to care about you as they should, more so what you can do to benefit them; supporting them financially, doing all their household duties, and I'll assume by the discussion of marriage prospects and so on that they will try to push you into a marriage with someone of their choosing who will benefit them socially as well. You can pay homage to your family's culture and be an American as well, many people from different ethnic backgrounds incorporate both, your parents just refuse to allow you to do so to keep control over you.   \n\n\nThey don't need your financial support, they want it to benefit your brother and father, and they're putting them both before you to achieve their own desires and wishes. Bad things won't start happening to you because you leave, otherwise the world would be full of women who've met that fate or worse. The people who would look down on someone and their family because a person looked for some independence aren't the kind of people who's opinion really matters in the grand scheme of life. Wanting to be independent doesn't make you selfish, they're selfish for wanting to keep you in that situation for their complete gain while stunting your growth as a person.   \n\n\nDon't let them dictate what you'll do, and don't let your aunt take your apartment. I wouldn't even let them know where it is, because I'd expect them to make things uncomfortable for you or attempt to get you evicted with all the things you've told me and how controlling they are.   \n\n\nLike you said, if they don't want to speak to you, so be it. You can't change stubborn people's minds by giving into their demands and maintaining the status quo.   \n\n\nOffering assistance would be a bad idea in my opinion, especially if they ostracize you. If they put themselves into a financial situation by choosing to remain in a more expensive neighborhood for your brother's schooling while your father also goes back for his masters degree, that's on them. They're adults and capable of making their own financial decisions, taking out student loans for the schooling etc. They're not your responsibility to support financially after you've moved out indefinitely. The only type of responsibility I could think of would be to take them in if they've fallen on hard times, or if they're too old to work/take care of themselves, but neither of these are the current situation. Odds are they'll give in and let it go eventually if you show them you won't be controlled. Either way you'll be much more happy living your life as you choose and see fit rather than being forced to live under their thumb and scrutiny.",

            "Ive seen this play out with Asian parents before. My friend was living and financially supporting his mom until he was about 32, when he decided to buy a house. His mom freaked out, guilt trip him like crazy for months. I felt so bad for him, it really affected him. She was poor enough that she qualified for assistance but it didn\u2019t pay for everything so he chipped in a few hundred additional every month to keep her happy. \n\nHe was much happier once he had his own place. I would say, if you aren\u2019t making enough money to support, it is what it is. You can always come home sometimes and help them still with things but there\u2019s no reason to continue living there. They need to accept that you guys are in a different culture and that\u2019s not what we do here. Show them the way.\n\nMy friends mom eventually came around. I guarantee yours will too.

            "Honestly please get out ASAP. Tell them your aunty can move in with them if they need the help and a fucking maid so bad. Tell them they are in danger of losing you forever if they don\u2019t at da ugh ten their act out.  Tell them the truth.  They are used to using your fear against you, I come from a somewhat religious family and they build a moral compass in you that they manipulate with fear.  Don\u2019t let it.  You are a good person.  You deserve to be happy.  If you already have the place set up and furnish I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re waiting for.  I wouldn\u2019t have said shit till they caught me moving out. Your father can get a new job if they need the money.  Please don\u2019t falter, you are strong and you can do this.",
            "If you're able to be financially independent from them, then it's not a matter of asking for their permission anymore. You're a grown person, doing this with your own money. They're trying to manipulate you into doing what they want, and there's no compromise at all; it's their way or you're a bad child they might possibly disown. The unfortunate fact is, there is no compromise because they refuse to compromise. The only way you can be your own person is to move out, and live your life the way you want it, because otherwise even after you've gotten married, they'll still be insisting that you have children after a certain amount of time, have a certain number of children, and raise those kids in a particular way. I know people who are now raising children they don't want and still living with their parents, because I live in Asia and the fear of upsetting their parents and their extended family is apparently more important than them being happy.\n\nHere's the thing, if you're already a grown person, earning enough money to rent/buy your own place. You do not need to ask permission from your parents to do things with your money, or to do things with your life. You are an adult, and that means you're responsible for yourself now. \"My mom says I can't\" is not a valid excuse for you anymore in any context; try telling your boss that when you don't go into work. Your interactions with your parents should be based on mutual respect, and you inform them of changes in your life not because you need to, but because you'd like to. They are not allowing your relationship to mature and progress because they still think of you as a child. The whole issue about marriage is particularly unsavoury for me because it sounds like they intend for you to marry off to someone who can give them a big dowry. Your mom in particular seems to think of you as her personal retirement fund.\n\nSticking around and allowing them to run your life will result in them running your life till the day someone dies or loses their mental capacity. It's not easu to break away from your parents, especially if they've spent your whole life indoctrinating you on filial piety and how it's your duty to take care of them. You are not a bad person for wanting to be happy and to live your own life. You are not a bad person for wanting boundaries and a mutually respectful relationship. I wish you the courage to see this toxicity for what it is and to move away from it.",

The one thing that is different is they\u2019re not pushing me for financial responsibility, but everything else (the cleaning, the gaslighting, the blow up) resonates so hard for me and I want you to know you\u2019re making the right choice. I don\u2019t know exactly what culture you come from but my parents reacted exactly the same way and I still moved because ultimately I knew it was the best choice for me. I don\u2019t personally think it\u2019s selfish to prioritize making the right moves to be happy in life as long as you\u2019re not hurting anyone. Even if it is selfish, this is the time of your life you get to be selfish so please take advantage of it.\n\nAs someone who has made the move, I\u2019m telling you this: you\u2019ve made up your mind, please go through with it. I promise you won\u2019t regret creating that space and boundary for yourself and you will have more opportunity for peace and growth than you could\u2019ve imagined. My parents said most of the same stuff to me, especially about God and marriage and it being improper, but at the end of the day I realized that they can be and are wrong and I can still be a good person and find happiness, love, and be active in religion without being a footstool for my parents. They are still unhappy with me but they will get over it, and if they choose not to, you can reevaluate and go no contact for as long as need be.\n\nYou\u2019re making the right choice OP. Don\u2019t let them force you to back down. Don\u2019t let your aunt move into YOUR apartment. Don't feel pressured to provide for them financially when you're just getting into a situation to be able to provide for yourself. You did all these things for yourself for a reason, just see it through and things will fall into place for you. If you ever wanna talk about it with someone who understands, feel free to PM me.",

If you haven't, don't tell them your address when you move. Start distancing yourself and if you need to, go no contact for awhile until you get on your feet. Stop giving them money, you're an adult and they have no control over you, their financial situation is their problem, not yours, focus on saving and making your life better. Them saying \"bad stuff\" will happen to you, once your leave their house, is scary as fuck, that sounds like a threat to me, but you know your parents best, if you think they could try to make bad things happen, don't take it lightly, protect yourself.

Why do you say you want a better life for me when in reality you still want me in the same box? \nIn the end I made the disastrous decision to marry in order to get away from them.

The idea of a conscience is what bothers you.

They are trying to hurt your feelings. I'm sure it comes from their background.  \n\nThey grew up with a different upbringing.No one likes change. If your parents didn't want you living like an American they shouldn't have brought you to America. They have a different upbringing than you and don't know how to comprehend the daughter they perceive in their head versus who is really in front of them. They EXPECT something of you and you aren't that, so they are lashing out.\n\nIt takes time for everyone to adjust.\n\nThe last thing parents want to do is lose their child.

There shouldn't be anything that damages it, and it shouldn't matter if you live with them or not. \n2. *I am being selfish to think that I should be independent.*  \nWhy is it selfish to want to be able to do things on your own? You shouldn't feel like you need to have a man to make it. That's not what love is. \n3. *Im trying to abandon my culture and he an American.*  \nI can't say much as I do not know your family's culture, but independence isn't just an American trait.\n4. *Instead of paying money in rent I should be saving so we can all buy a house together.*  \nSo, instead of you doing it for yourself, they expect you to furnish everything for them? Houses are expensive. The purchase cost is just the first cost, not the last. \n5. *It is wrong for a girl to not stay with her family before marriage as it will damage my prospects.*  \nNo, no it's not. You need to know who you are. You're not a child, you need to figure out your path in this world. You cannot do that if you are forced to stay home till marriage then stay home more after married. \n6. *I should stay to fix the issues we have as a family.*  \nYour living conditions have nothing to do with this. You don't need to be under their roof to have a good relationship. \n7. *They need my financial support still.*  \nWhy is that? Do they not make ends meet? Do they live beyond their means? Do they think of you as their piggy bank? You have to be able to take care of yourself before you can take care of someone else, otherwise you just sink with them. \n8. *I will be leaving the spiritual covering of God from my parents and bad things will start happening to me.*  \nGod isn't so unforgiving. If you weren't meant to be able to be independent then you'd never yearn to be independent. You do, so obviously you were meant to. Nothing is without reason. \n9. *Other people will look down on me and the family.*  \nNo, just no. Nobody would look down on your family. You are a person, not property, you have a right to be happy and to chase your own dreams. You do not need a man to do so. You do not need your family under your roof to do so. \n10. *I am selfish.*  \nFrom the outside looking in, there is selfishness going on, but it's not on you. It's insanely selfish for your parents to only think of their own needs, their own image, their own reputation. Nowhere in any of these comments has your well-being been taken into account. Wanting your own dreams, your own life, and your own path to follow isn't selfish, it's part of growing up. We can't stay kids forever. You shouldn't have to stay if you do not wish. It shouldn't damage the family to have your own dreams. You shouldn't have to support your parents. Sure, it's ok to help them out when they need it, but they are asking a lot of you. Especially if they want you to buy a house so they can continue to live with you. What happens to them when you are married and your husband doesn't want inlaws to live with you? Or if you two decide to move to a far off land? Would you be selfish then? What if you already had your own family, and you NEEDED your own space for your family? Would it be selfish for you to put your kids needs over your parents?",

That sucks, but you have to do what you have to do to make yourself happy.

They purely want you there to make their life easier, not because they love and cherish you. \n\nYou need to keep your happiness as a priority so you dont end up living a miserable life that you hate. So many people are stuck in your situation without a way out. So all you can do what makes you happy and try to keep some relationship with your family if that's what you want. Just keep doing what you're doing. All of those reasons they gave you? None of them are bad or even that true. Living on your own will not rub potential mates the wrong way. If anything it will help rule out all the ones who just want you as a thing to collect and rule over. Maybe you'll find someone who respects and looks up to your ability to take care of yourself.

You are 25 and should be able to do what you want within reason. \n\nI have a similar situation although not so extreme that maybe will help you feel better about your choice to move. I graduated college in 2016 and got a state job a year later, I don\u2019t make a whole lot of money, but enough to support myself. I\u2019ve always made things work even when I was broke, and if I asked to borrow money from my mom I would pay it back in a month or less. I bought a car about a year and a half ago, and my mom told me I was selfish for buying a car when I knew she was struggling (I pay our cell phone every month and normally give her between 100-200 monthly for her bills). I tried explaining my car needed so much money in work and was literally falling apart and she didn\u2019t understand and didn\u2019t talk to me for about a week. She was still mad but she got over it because again, it\u2019s my money and I should be able to do what I want with it. \n\nFast forward to present day, the past two months I\u2019ve paid half of my moms rent (on top of my own) and paid for two eight hour trips home to be with her for the holidays plus back paid her car payment which she is 2 months behind on. She asked me for money last week and I straight up said no, mostly because I didn\u2019t have it, and she got mad. She said \u201cif you don\u2019t hwve money to give me then you shouldn\u2019t be buying festival tickets\u201d I calmly explained to her that it is my money to do what I want with, I pay my bills and some of hers every month, and if she can\u2019t handle it then she needs to figure it out like an adult. \n\nI\u2019m planning on moving home in the summer and I know it\u2019s going to be a pain for me and I\u2019ll end up spending more then I\u2019m saving. But I have to move home (different story). \n\nAnyway, the point of me sharing this long story is that hopefully your parents will realize that you\u2019re not doing anything wrong. It\u2019s a different time and it\u2019s not a bad thing to be an independent women and be able to be on your own, because overall you have you and that\u2019s it. \n\nI hope things get better for you.",

It breaks my heart. It truly breaks my heart that my family would rather be loyal to the air, to ideas, than to the person they see before them. \n\nBut it must be done. I must be brave enough. Or my life will be a sad one full of regret. You are in America, you have rights, you are allowed to independent. You must choose it, you must be brave enough. You can be.

I have seen this happen a few times now to be honest. One thing I will say is this... They are doing whatever they possibly can to get you to stay for now because they still think they have power and leverage over you. Once this is done and you move and things transition to a new state of normal, they will also accept the new reality. Idk how long that will take but it will eventually happen. At that point, you and your family can start building a relationship again but on different terms. Terms that include mutual respect and boundaries. They do not want you out of their life, they just can't accept what's happening. The way you described them, I can tell they have low emotional intelligence but like I said, they will come around eventually once they see you operating like a grown independent adult that you are. I know it's tough but everything will be fine. Sometimes you just gotta rip off the band-aid. Good luck with everything!",

She gave me the same lecture - you're being selfish, why waste money on rent when I can give her the money... blah blah. That was 14 years ago. I moved out as planned and never looked back. Since then, I have cut my mom off. I felt like a horrible person for a long time but it's so freeing! Freedom > \"feeling\" like a bad person. I am now married and have 2 kids of my own.

The family relationship is on them, not you. You want to keep the relationship, they are trying to do the \"my way or I burn the bridge\" so they are more responsible for this than you.\n2. A 25-year woman should not feel guilty about leaving home. The bird eventually needs to leave the nest, and from your story, they are more concerned about your money and cleaning of the house than your company.\n3. This is just stupid. Leaving home is not leaving your culture, and if you do leave the culture, it's your choice to make! You're supporting the house, for crying out loud, you have the choice of what to make of your life.\n4. When the bird leaves the nest, the mommy bird doesn't come along. You want to be independent, not root yourself with your family for the rest of your life.\n5. First off: your love life is not of their concern. I had two dates now with a girl that has parents think the same thing, and this is not 1920's anymore: a girl that supports herself can live wherever she wants, and if the man thinks this is a dealbreaker, well, he's a bullet dodged.\n6. They are the problem, not you. They should be looking to fix the issue, because when they say that, it's just mean \"let's forget that and come back to what it was.\"\n7. They are grown people with 2 kids. They cannot depend financially and that's it. Move to a different home, I'm pretty sure they can find another good district that isn't so expensive.

If I were you, I\u2019d find a way to both thank them for that (although I understand that you\u2019re probably not in a thankful mood), and explain that the best way to make the most of that opportunity is to be allowed to grow independently! You\u2019re not \u201ctrying to\u201d be American, you are!",
            "Just good luck and stay strong, don\u2019t back down e joy your freedom.",
            "This sounds almost entirely like a situation one of my friends was in. Her and her family are very strong Baptist\u2019s, and aside from the financial support angle, they used everything you said as a tactic to keep her in the house.\n\nAs I told her, the most important thing you can do is plant your foot firmly and to keep reminding yourself that you\u2019re not a selfish person for wanting to be independent. On the contrary, demanding you support your family while living on your own is what\u2019s selfish.\n\nYour parent\u2019s financial burdens are not your own, nor is it your duty to help fill the gap and to adjust your life for them to not make a change themselves. You need to let them figure out their finances on their own despite how you may feel; they have in the past and they certainly can now. You\u2019re not a selfish person for not participating, they don\u2019t NEED your financial support, it\u2019s putting a bandaid on a broken leg.\n\nSo here\u2019s my bits of advice to you:\n\n1) Get your Aunty out of the apartment. If she\u2019s currently staying with you, this is your top priority and you need to speak with management or whoever to get her out. If she has a key, get the locks changed. Most places do this for free and it can be done within the day. If she doesn\u2019t, Keep it that way and make sure she doesn\u2019t set foot inside. If she\u2019s one day outside your door knocking, ignore it. If it persists, get the complex\u2019s security to escort her out, get the police if you honestly have to. This is a control tactic they\u2019re trying to pull, don\u2019t let them establish it. Not only will it further strain the relationship with you and your family, but a lot of places consider having someone who isn\u2019t on the lease living with you a breach in contract and could put you in a bad spot depending on how strict they are about it.\n\n2) Distance yourself from the family for a bit of time. This one can be a bit hard to do and understand that I\u2019m not telling you to cut them off entirely, this is merely to set boundaries. Since this is all still fresh, I can only assume that a lot of the conversations y\u2019all have are mainly guilt trips and if that\u2019s the case, take a step back for awhile to let things cool off. A lot of phones nowadays have it setup to where you can turn off notifications from specific contacts, so if they blow up your phone a lot, you can simply turn them off so you can deal with them when you\u2019re ready to without it disturbing texts or calls from say work, friends or anyone else. Again, I\u2019m not saying to cut them off entirely, though that\u2019s your business if you feel it\u2019s necessary. All I\u2019m saying is when the snide remarks and guilt trips start coming your way, take a step back and them work their own issues out.\n\n3) Stay strong and stand firm. I wish I could promise that things will get easier, but it all depends how your family is. However, it is of the upmost importance that you remind yourself that you\u2019re not selfish for wanting to be independent, you\u2019re not a bad person for wanting to take control of your own life and you\u2019re not the reason for if things don\u2019t work out with your family, as the ball is in their court now. It\u2019ll be hard and they will try a lot of tactics to get you back in their household and you\u2019ve gotta stand firm and say no, you need to set the precedence that you\u2019re taking control of your life now. \n\nThough our situations differ, I grew up with narcissistic parents and it got to a point to where I had to cut them out entirely. However things can always get better; my dad came to terms with everything and understands his past transgressions and now him and I have a fantastic relationship. On the flip side though, my mother will never change and she and I haven\u2019t spoken in over 4 years. However it may play out for you though, just remember that you\u2019re not the one at fault and that you\u2019re not a bad person by any means for wanting to take control. You\u2019re an adult now and you have every reason to want to branch out and start your own life, don\u2019t let them take that from you.\n\nWishing you the best!",
            "It's  not a bad thing to be independent for the most independent people find the best ways to succeed in life. \n\nOur families are polar opposite. If my family never encouraged to kick me out of the nest my wings would never grow.",

            "Hey friend. As a first gen immigrant with aunties galore and parents very concerned about my doings, let me give you some advice. You're not a bad child. Coming from collectivist cultures where parents and elders are respected can be awesome because we all help each other out and we care for one another. But here's the thing; this is the time for your parents to let you continue your journey into adulthood by letting you grow. You won't lose any spiritual covering (it's actually Biblical for people to individuate: see the passage about \"a man/woman shall leave their parents and cleave to their spouse, etc.\" (Putting this here if you told to those values, etc. \n\nReligion/Spirituality aside, I struggled with this too when I decided to take my own career path and get married early to someone outside our culture. My parents fought me, fearing the worst, and I constantly wondered if I was a bad child like everyone was telling me. Eventually, they apologized and we reconciled, and they came to see that they had to be non-hypocritical and learn to trust me, the teachings they imparted to me, and God with me (again, ignore this if it's not your thing).\n\nYour family needs to let you handle your finances on your own, and unfortunately, although it'll be difficult for them, they need to take responsibility for the house or flat they are leasing and get their finances in order. My mum and Dad consult me on financial stuff because I learned from them and took it several steps further. Perhaps you can be that person for your parents eventually. \n\nThey also need to respect that you are just trying to grow and carry out those great things you learnt from them. Ultimately, you can become an even better person and parent by continually working on this self-awareness and building self compassion. Best of luck to you, OP. Hope all is well.",

In fact, I had no idea how hard she struggled until I was in my mid-thirties and offered to help, willingly and she was so very grateful! She was a great mom and took good care of me, so I was honored to help her a bit where I could. \n\nYou have been treated like a MAID or even a SLAVE because you have to clean up after filthy people and you haven\u2019t been \u201callowed to leave\u201d.

To expect you to pay to rent a room you no longer live in is ridiculous. \n\nThe only people who will look down on you are the people who don\u2019t know the truth and it shouldn\u2019t matter to you anyway!\n\nEnjoy your new place!

You have said it yourself OP, they want you there so you can be under their control, be their maid, AND so they do not have to make any added effort to financially support themselves. They chose rent in an  expensive neighborhood, ((and I get the want your brother to get a good education)) however, THAT IS STILL ON THEM OP NOT YOU!!!\n\nOnline schooling does not take up all ones time. Your dad could work more then 20 hours a week.  MANY PEOPLE DO!!  I know a man in his 60's taking online courses for a degree, and is working 2 jobs.  YOU SHOULD NOT BE PAYING FOR THE CHOICES THEY MADE. They have no right to have their choices come at the expense of YOUR LIFE!! They want a servant, and added income so they do not have to make any more effort,  not a daughter.\n\nYou have a right to live your own life,  you are NOT a bad person or daughter, you are not selfish,  they are the ones being selfish, and obsessive  and domineering, They want you to pay their way so they do not have to make the added effort, the guilt they are putting on you is a manipulation tactic to take the attention  away from their own selfishness.",

There was an older Hispanic man I always saw on my route to work, he speaks nearly no English, and my Spanish is awful but for whatever reason we began saying hi to each other.\n\nBecause I was always on my way to work I never really got to know him too well. But 5 days a week for 6 years he would try his best English and I would do my best Spanish and we'd say hi, how are you, talk about the weather or recent holiday etc.\n\nObviously we weren't super close and I didn't even know his name until recently. But he always got my day off to a good start and I always missed him on the days he wasn't there. One time it was very hot and I collapsed coming out of the station and he bought me a water and called me a cab. I will really miss our morning greetings.\n\nWell he wasn't around for 2 weeks, which is the longest he's ever been gone so I went inside the coffee shop he's always in front of and asked about him and they told me he passed away. Apparently he had been very sick and just passed over the weekend.

Online translation services are generally in accurate for things more complicated than basic phrases",
            "My little brothers funeral was in March. After the service, people were coming up to me and introducing themselves and telling me how they knew my brother and other little stories. I remember every single one and am still so grateful to know about those things. \n\nDo you maybe have a friend that knows Spanish that could maybe translate the story to one of his family members of him helping you when you fainted? \n\nEither way my vote is \"go.\" \n\nEdit to add, his younger relatives probably speak English. ",
            "You should absolutely go. I remember at my grandma's funeral, there were SO many people there that no one in my family knew. But these people knew her, and she knew these people, and I just thought that was kind of beautiful. Showed a whole other side to my grandmother that we didn't get to know while she was alive. Chances are, given how you've described him, you wouldn't be the only \"stranger\" that he impacted. He sounded lovely and I'm sorry for your loss.",

Let them know that even though you didn't know him well, he had become part of you life, and that you will miss him.\n\nMost likely, his loved ones will actually appreciate that. It adds another facet to the man they loved.",
            "Certainly. I was very pleased to see my dad's realtor and favorite cashier from 7-11 at his funeral among the family and friends. It made me remember what a friendly guy he was. It'll make his relatives happy.",
            "I think you should go. When my father recently passed there was almost 200 people who showed up, to the point that the church was standing room only, and absolutely PACKED (most of them I obviously didn't know), and my whole family found it so touching and just nice\ud83d\ude0c Just the idea that he, as a person, separate from being my terrific dad, also touched the lives of SO many people to the point that they wanted to say goodbye to him, really meant more than words can describe. Just go. If anyone asks tell them the truth, that he helped you before and was always kind to you. You regret the things you don't do more than the things you do. ",
            "You should go. Your story of how this gentleman made such an impact on your day will be nice for the family to hear. They know he was a great guy, but for a stranger to point it out--what an overwhelming compliment ",
            "Yes, go to the funeral. I think it would be nice for the family to know that the guy was a bright spot in a stranger's daily routine. It'll also be good for you - he was a small, but good, part of your life. That's worth remembering.",
            "I'm late to the game like always, but wanted to put in my two cents.\n\nI have been in your shoes. When I was working at a retail store back in college, I was frequently assigned to work the snack bar. Twice a week, we had an elderly couple come in. Leroy and Nancy. They were the sweetest couple I'd ever met and pretty hard to miss. Leroy was every inch the \"Rhinestone Cowboy\", and Nancy's makeup always reminded me more of Mimi from Drew Carey than anything else. But they were adorable. Leroy completely doted on Nancy. Nancy had a slew of health issues ranging from migraines to rheumatoid arthritis. She was wheelchair bound and Leroy would  come in, wave at me in the snack bar and wheel a chair out to Nancy, who was waiting in the car. The wave was my signal to start their usual meal: A hamburger with as many veggies as I could fit on it, and a grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes, shared order of fries and two senior drinks. And they'd come in, settle into a table, eat and chit chat with me, tell me all kinds of stories about their Dalmatian Molly, and rant for hours about the latest episode of American Idol. They always made a point to ask me about how I was doing, as they frequently saw me hiding my homework in the back office during slow periods. \n\nEventually, I moved on from that job, and I'll be honest, I missed seeing Leroy and Nancy. One day, my mother called me from her job at another retail store where she was the manager. She asked me if the name Leroy meant anything to me. I told her, yeah, a couple used to come into the store all the time. She told me that Leroy spent the better part of a day searching at various retail stores for my mom (knowing she worked at one from previous conversations with them), so that he could inform me that Nancy had passed away. She said he gave her the information for the funeral, and he said that he knew Nancy would be \"tickled pink\" if I were able to make it. \n\nI made SURE I made it. If for nothing else, than so I could finally give Leroy a hug and thank him for all the times they sat and talked with me. He was thrilled that I made it and just knew that Nancy would have loved to see me there. I lost contact with him after that, as these things tend to go. I've seen him around town once or twice since then, but that's about it. \n\nEven though you say you didn't know this gentleman very well, you knew a side of him that his family may not have known. How he didn't let a language barrier stop him from striking up a conversation with a stranger. Or how he helped someone when they needed it at the station. If for any other reason, go for you, for some kind of closure of the friendship you shared with him. ",
            "As someone who's had to deal with quite a bit of loss, there's nothing more comforting to those who remain than to hear of stories like yours.  They knew him, but imagine finding out that when no one was watching, their grandpa/father/husband was out there being a good person to someone he barely knew for no other reason than being who he is.  ",
            "I'm your age and I have been unfortunate to have been on a few funerals some close and some somewhat distant relatives. There were always people I had no idea of who they were and it made the event easier to know that the diseased had a life that touched more people than you knew of. ",
            "You sound like such a lovely person. I think it would not be weird at all for you to go. ",
            "IDK if this is just me, but if I lost a loved one the biggest comfort to me would be seeing how many peoples' lives they had touched in a positive way. If he were my dad or grandpa I'd be so moved to see the random person he rode the train with at the funeral. I think you should go. ",
            "When my friend's father passed away they had a nice memorial at their house. Towards the end of the day a lady came in. She said she wanted to pay her respects.. She didn't know anyone there. Turns out she used to see my friend's dad when she walked through the neighborhood. He was always kind and made a point to say hello, he was always smiling  (he was) she was completely wrecked by his passing, I could tell it really shook her. After she left, my friend said out of everyone that came meeting her and hearing how her dad impacted a total stranger in such a positive way...she said that really meant a lot to her to hear that. Go to the funeral. You may feel out of place, maybe a little uncomfortable but it is never a bad thing to celebrate someone's life that made an impact on you. ",
            "A friend of mine worked in a popular youth hostel in my city. There was a 'young' senior fellow there travelling around my country. He had a sudden heart attack and died during his stay. \n\nMy friend took it upon himself to write a letter to his family and introduce himself. He told them that even though that man was on the other side of the world, he wasn't alone when he died. He had made many friends and was with them when he passed. They wrote him back to let him know how much comfort that letter gave them. \n\nGo. Introduce yourself. They'll be happy to see how your friend touched other people's lives. ",
            "I think it's really touching you want to go and I am sure that it would touch his family and friends if they knew your story.",
            "His family will love to hear how their loved one was your friend.  You should go. ",
            "You should absolutely go to the funeral. It's completely appropriate. You can explain to the family how you knew him, and what nice memories you had of talking with him.  :)",
            "Yes, you should go. Recently my wife lost an aunt and her family were happy to meet people such as a bank teller that used to talk to her aunt. It meant a lot to her family to see the people who were impacted by her aunt.",
            "I would go- he probably told his family about you anyway; seeing you everyday on his commute, and with the fainting episode, these are note worthy things that we chitchat to our loved ones about when they ask us about out day. I think it would also be nice for the relatives to know he touched your life in this way.",
            "Go. Funerals are for the living. Funerals are markers in our lives, denoting when relationships end and allowing us the be grateful for the ones we still have. I was once told to go to every marriage, baptism, and funeral of my friends and family. We meet our growing families, make new friends, and say goodbye to the dead while holding hands with the living. Go. ",
            "You should go and if anyone asks, tell your story.",

            "I lost a younger sibling recently and it was very hard on our family. One of the things that really helped was the attendance at the funeral, even people we didn't know who came up to us, introduced themselves and told stories exactly like yours. ",
            "Definitely go. I am sure the family would love nothing more than to hear you met after you collapsed at a train station and he was there to help you and you would see each other often after that and always said hi. ",
            "Go. Someone is sure to speak English. Make sure to tell the family why you are there. It would be a very touching story for them to remember.",
            "I think it would be sweet. Knowing that someone I loved had a impact on a stranger would mean the world to me",
            "Incase another push does it for you... Definitely go!",
            "I'm not of this man's culture but in mine it's encouraged that anyone who knew the deceased positively show up to celebrate their life.",
            "Yes, please go. \n\nIt will be nice for them to see that he touched many people in his life. He sounds like he was very sweet. I know I would appreciate it. And yes likely someone will speak English, don't worry about that\n\nEdit: And just another note that even I teared up a little reading about you and this sweet old guy and how kind he was. And I don't know either of you! I assure you that you and your story will be very well received.",
            "First off - yes, you should absolutely go if you are able to.  \n\nThat said, I look at decisions like that this way.  If I don't {insert decision}, will I regret it later?  Could I ever change the fact that I now regret that (ie is the decision irrevocable).  If I do {insert decision}, is there really any irrevocable harm.  \n\nIn this case, the answer is, yeah you'll likely regret it, you could never undo that, and no there is no harm.  \n\nJust go, be polite, pay your respects, and peace out. No one even needs to know why you are there, but if they ask, politely explain you knew him from commuting for 6 years.  ",
            "I think the time frame is what's important here. If it's someone you saw once on the train and never saw again, and then found out he had died, then no. It wouldn't be appropriate. \n\nBut that isn't the case here. This is someone who you've \"known\" in a sense, for... Roughly half of your adult life. He has clearly been part of your life, and left an impression on you, and his close friends and family should understand that, and be delighted to hear from you.\n\nHell, if my father passed away, I'd be very thankful to see a complete stranger showing up, who I had never met before, just because my dad had left enough of a positive impact on their lives to be remembered. ",
            "Absolutely. If it were my dad, I'd love for you to come and hear the story... Broken Spanish or not :) ",
            "yes, go. Write your little story and bring it. Give it to his family, or speak up. These are the important little parts in our lives (their lives) that can show little conversations day to day mean something.",
            "It's very rare for anyone to have the 'who the fuck are you?' mentality at funerals- everybody is so full of grief and love from the deceased that it's the last thing on their mind. \n\nIf anything, I suspect that many of his family members and friends would really love to know that he had a major impact & brightened up the day of a stranger on the train for 6 years. ",
            "I was only a young when my grandfather passed away, but he didn't speak English, and we didn't know each other all too well, but it was an incredibly touching time. I'm not sure about how others do funerals, as the only ones I've ever been to have been for Italians (In australia for reference) but we do a thing where the family stand there after the funeral and every lines up and comes and gives their respects to you. We were there for 2 hours, with all the people coming through. It was incredible to see the lives this man touched in his 80 years on this earth, and it has had a profound effect on me, to make sure I also leave this world eventually having touched the lives of so many that they felt the need to come and offer respect to the family and to him in such a way.\n\nSo to actually get to a point, yes you should go, and you have no idea how much this means to a family grieving the loss of someone special.",
            "Believe me if they are Hispanic, they will probably even accept u as \"family\", I say this because in my Mexican community, people are very friendly and accepting of newcomers and strangers, especially foreigners, I'm not sure why but we as a Hispanic culture tend to accept most peoples, I think. So yup yup, definitely go pay your respects, they'll hopefully be happy to meet their relatives friend, cuz thats what you are! ",
            "Please go. Friends and family are especially welcoming at funerals. They would be very touched to know their loved one had such an impact on a friend from the train. \n\nMaybe just check if he has an obit and if they list information for the services- usually it will specify if it is private or public.",

            "I think it's a wonderful idea for you to go.  That's a wonderful report you have with him that no one else's does and I think his family would love to hear about that once you introduce yourself. You spent five days a week for 6 years saying hello every morning it's only fitting that now you get to say goodbye.",
            "You should definitely go! If really no one knows English, then surely you can use Google translate in a pinch. Anyway, the family will be touched to know his impact in the world. You don't have you stay long either, just the service then your condolences to the window/family. ",
            "I believe you should go, like others are saying as well. They're right. It's wonderful to see a funeral filled with people who remember the person who has passed. Even just the presence of so many people brings comfort. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe have a family friend who kind of drifted apart over the years. Still, we care for him. A few months ago, our family found out his brother was brutally murdered. It was all over the local news. Even though we hadn't seen our friend in years and I personally hadn't met his brother, my family and I attended the funeral. When our friend saw us he expressed his gratitude and said this was really, really appreciated. I'm sure you will be fine if you go, I don't see anything inappropriate about it! ",
            "Last year I went to the funeral of an acquaintance from work who passed away far, far too young in an accident. His family all lived in another state, and so they knew pretty much none of the people at his funeral. They were so happy to hear about the impact he had made on our lives, no matter how small, because it showed the wonderful person he was when he was out of their sight.\n\nI think you should definitely go. I know that if someone who knew my father/uncle/etc. in the same capacity as you was to come to their service and tell us (the family) what he meant to them, it would be a comfort. ",
            "Go!   This is for both you and him!  His family and friends will most likely be happy to hear how highly you thought of him!!  You will most likely be a source of comfort to them!",

On top of the grief I was already feeling, I also felt sad because so few people attended her service - so many of her friends and family had already died, or were unable to make it. I know she didn't really have any acquaintances like you with the man in question (she didn't get out much), but I would have loved to meet those people if she had such acquaintances.",

So many people showed up to my grandfathers service with similar stories to yours- bright moments on even the cloudiest of days.",
            "Yes, and it's also okay to let the family know who you are and why you're there. Most of the grandchildren and some of the aunts and uncles will know English. It's very okay to pay your respects. Yes, go. It's better if you do. ",

            "My grandfather was a lot like this, and although we had a small, private ceremony for him, if we had had a more open one, I would have loved to hear from the strangers who were always happy to say hi to him in the neighborhood. It's a nice reaffirmation of the kind of friendly, kind man he always was. So definitely go if you want to. ",

            "There are too many people I've met, all of whom I never got to know better when they were alive. Their families never knew I knew them, their friends never knew I cared enough to smile and say hi. I look back on moments I could have introduced myself to their families and friends and said a kind word, but instead chose to feel as though I was an intruder. It's lonely and sad. Don't do what I did, OP. Connect with the family at the funeral and put in a good word about the man. It will make you feel good, and they will feel a little better too. ",

His family will probably be very moved to know he made such a difference in people's lives that even casual acquaintances want to attend his funeral. \n\nWhen my grandfather died, it was literally standing room only at the funeral (maybe 10-15 people stood at the back of the church for the whole of the exceedingly long Catholic funeral service), which is basically what you want: live your life so that it will be standing room only at your funeral. Sounds like your friend did :)",
            "You can only attend a funeral once, go. I think it would be so extremely touching to the family to meet a stranger that was his friend and knew him outside of a family/personal context, adds to the belief that he was a good man. A far cry from being a distraction. Go, embrace the awkwardness, and it's not like you'll have to face them again (if things go really as badly as imagined). And who knows what beautiful friendships and connections may evolve through the extension of this friendly stranger. We are all family at the end of the day. :)",
            "Go for yourself, to say goodbye. Y'all may not have had deep conversations, but it's a big, weird, emotional mess of feelings when you stop seeing someone all of a sudden. Remember his relatives will be there grieving and when I have a lot to say in Spanish, and know the correct words will not come to me in the moment, I either write them down before hand so that I can convey my true feelings to the person or I put it in a card. Odds are fairly good that his kids or nieces/nephews speak English and you can just tell them the story in English, but you might feel more comfortable if you wrote down the basic Spanish phrasing for your conversation before hand. ",
            "Go.  Let them know that chatting with him on the bus made your days better and you will miss him.  This type of testimony will bring his family comfort and remind them that he was impactful.  They will remember that for a long time.  ",
            "It's always touching to hear how your loved ones affected a stranger's life. I really think you should go. I'm sure his family would love to know that he made your morning commute a little brighter..",
            "Yes, it is appropriate. They will appreciate anyone coming to show respect for their lost loved one. ",
            "You might have already gone, and I don't think I'm allowed to link here, but there was an NPR story by Deirdre Sullivan back in 2005 called \"Always Go to the Funeral\". \n\nThe author made the point that showing the family/loved ones of the deceased what an impact they made on people's lives, even complete strangers is an honor to the person who died. It shows the living how much their loved one mattered, even in a small way. \n\nGreat article and it's right at the top of google search \"Always go to the funeral\". It made quite an impact on me. ",
            "Did the coffee shop people know him personally or did they also get to know him over time? And how did they know about the funeral details? I feel like if they know, the funeral is likely open to all, and you wouldn't be intruding on his family. Like you say, I would bring a card explaining how I knew him and what he meant to me, and then if the funeral turns out to be a private thing you can just give someone the card to show your respects. But I think they would really appreciate you coming and letting them know you cared about him. I would have found that really touching at any of my family member's funerals.",
            "Go. I have never regretted going to a funeral (or visitation) to pay my respects. I have, however, regretted NOT going to one. You have a very touching story, and even if you don't share it with anyone there, attending is a wonderfully kind, compassionate, grown-up thing to do. ",
            "Hispanics dont have the same \"intruding\" idea that whites do. I dont think you will be intruding on his funeral. His family will be okay and not worried that you will be there. They will see you as someone whose life he touched and appreciate the solidarity.",
            "How sweet of you to consider his family's feelings. However, If this were my dad or grandfather, I would welcome you with open arms and forever cherish your stories and connection with him. You should definitely go.",
            "Go to the funeral. You are showing respect to him and his family. The family, I expect, would appreciate it if you attended. You can tell them the story you posted which I am sure they would love to hear.",
            "Do it for sure. Our family recently lost a relative with some mental disabilities. He was very high functioning, but a bit off which pushed some people away. We recently had a memorial service for him and outside of the extended family, we didn't expect many people to show up. Over 60 people who we had never met showed up, from his synagogue, apartment complex and waiters from the restaurants he frequented. We had never met these people before and it was a shock, but extremely sweet to see how many people he touched throughout his life. ",
            "Don't crash it. Definitely ask to come from whichever family member is arranging it, but don't crash it.\n\nIt's definitely a good idea to go, just make sure you are being respectful to the family in the process."
