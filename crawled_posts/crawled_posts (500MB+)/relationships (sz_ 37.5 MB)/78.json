        "selftext": "**Original post - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ub78m/my_25f_boyfriends_27m_best_friend_27m_cheated_on/**\n\nI was initially going to see my Sami just a few days after I found out what happened, but canceled on him. I took the weekend to think, talk to a few friends & read over the comments to my original post. After a bit of thinking, I decided to break up with him. Sami lied to me, lied to our mutual friend Lauren, covered up for cheating, and knew full well that his friend Jon was having sex with multiple girls and doing it \"raw\". He basically decided his friendship with a cheater was more important than Lauren being exposed to STDs. That was the deal breaker.\n\nI called Sami on Tuesday and asked him to meet up with me in a public place. When we got there, I told him what Lauren had told me. He initially denied, denied, denied. But I think he could see from the look on my face that I wasn't about to be fooled. He literally looked me in the eyes and said, \"To be honest, wouldn't it be worse if I was the kind of pussy who didn't cover for his friends? Don't you want a man who is loyal?\"\n\nGod help me, I was upset talking to him but he said that I burst out laughing. What he was saying was just so ridiculous but he said it as though he was a martyr. I stopped laughing after a second but the look on his face changed completely. He leaned in and said \"You stupid bitch, you think Jon was the only one fucking around?\"\n\nHe's never cussed at me before or said anything with so much anger, especially not with the intent to hurt me, but for some reason I just didn't care. I thought so little of him at that moment that his opinion didn't matter to me. It was actually kind of a comfort that he said that to me because it proves that he's a fuckboy. \"When people show you who they are, believe them.\"\n\nSo I just got up and left. I picked up Chipotle then went home and watched \"Making a Murderer\". A few hours later I called Lauren and explained to her everything that happened. She comforted me then advised me to get tested for STDs immediately. She ended up coming with me for support to get tested and then a week later I got the results that I'm clean (and so is Lauren btw).\n\nAnd that was that.\n\n**tl;dr - My boyfriend who was helping his best friend cheat ended up being a cheater too. Both relationships are now ruined, but the two girls ended up becoming even better friends.**\n",

On one hand I can see how that's incriminating, on the other hand is hope my SO would know I'm not that easily influenced by my peers. I have a hard time imagining cutting contact with literally my lifelong friend and who my family considers my brother, over his actions towards his GF. I realize this story is different, all 4 of you were pretty tight, he lied to you, etc, but still, it makes me wonder what I would do in a similar situation. It's easy to say you'll take the high road, but most IRL situations are never that cut and dry. \n\nYou ex was an asshole though, so good on you OP for getting rid of him. Had he been honest with you from the get, or at least talked to you about it, I'd feel a little for him, but he turned out to be an ass anyway. ",

She didn\u2019t take brushing her teeth seriously until she got two cavities and to this day refuses to brush her tongue so her breath smells bad (I sometimes get on to her about it but she\u2019ll lie and say she did). She\u2019s never really taken care of herself because my mom has always babied her.\n      \nAnyway, her bad habits have extended to her room. One of our dogs like to stay in her room, and because of that it will poop and pee on the pee pads we had to start placing. One of her only chores was to pick up the waste and keep her room clean, but she doesn\u2019t. She will literally leave the poop there for days and rarely changes the pee pads, and it\u2019s to the point where I have to go in daily now to do it. Not only that but she never cleans her mattress (we tried to once together and brown stuff kept coming off the mattress but it\u2019s still not clean) and rarely washes her sheets. Because of all this and more, she smells terrible and I can\u2019t stand the smell of her room (our rooms are right next to each other too so when my door is opened I can smell it). \n      \nI have a really sensitive nose and some sensory issues so the stench always sends me into a sensory overload episode and I can\u2019t really stand to be around her anymore. I try to tell her that she needs to wash her sheets and keep her room clean, but she just does the whole \u201cno you\u201d routine because she thinks I\u2019m teasing her. \n      \nI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m going to college in a few months so I won\u2019t be able to pick up after her and I don\u2019t want this to keep going into her adult life. Does anyone have any advice on how to get her to listen to me seriously?\n\nTL;DR: My sister smells really bad because she doesn\u2019t clean her room up and takes any advice from me as if I\u2019m teasing her. I don\u2019t know how to get her to listen.\n\nEdit: I want to clarify that the dog is a chihuahua and her room isn\u2019t like covered in poop or anything. It\u2019s just that there are small areas where the dog will poop and she\u2019ll just ignore it while she does something else. Also, she usually smells fine after she takes a bath, the problem usually rises when she gets out of her room in the morning until she bathes again (because we generally stay in the living room and hang out in the evenings so she doesn\u2019t really go back in there).",

Your parents don\u2019t seem too concerned about holding her accountable and she doesn\u2019t seem too concerned about getting better. \n\nI\u2019m not one for giving absolute advice most of the time, but to me it seems like the only solution here is accepting that it\u2019s not your job to parent or fix her, nor are you able to. Let it go and go to college. She will grow up, or not, on her own time. But sheltering her and trying to fix her problems for her isn\u2019t going to do anything but shield her from the consequences of her lack of hygiene. \n\nYou\u2019re going to meet plenty of people in your life who you will feel the need to fix, and often they will be people you deeply care for and don\u2019t want anything bad to happen to. But this is a dangerous path to follow for yourself. Learning when to let others help themselves is a vital skill to learn in order to not end up in codependent or abusive relationships. \n\nSo the takeaway here is you can only help your sister and yourself by not helping.

Poor body care and mouth hygiene can make you sick and even damage your heart. You probably don't notice the smell because you're used to it, but it's REALLY bad and I'm worried it may cause you a lot of social problems if you don't learn to deal with it. I don't want to hurt your feelings but I'd rather take the hit than have a date drop you in a few years and spread rumors about you being diseased. I'm doing this from a place of love, but another person may use this to hurt you, bully you, and abuse you. I don't want that. I promise I'm not judging you, I want to help you. I understand that a lot of this can be overwhelming, but you can talk to me about it. Anything you need, it can stay between us.\"\n\n\nDon't enable her by doing the work FOR her but if she needs taught how to do things or guidance getting organized, or emotional support you can help her. \n\n\nSome ideas that she might find may help (from myself, an adhd depressed potato with chronic pain!): \n\n\n1. Laundry stripping: mix equal parts washing soda (not baking soda), borax, and oxyclean. Fill bathtub with hot water, add laundry and soap mix. Soak laundry for 8 hours, stirring every hour. When done, run through the washing machine with just water, then dry like normal. You can do this with blankets, bed linens, pillows, clothes, curtains, stuffed animals, area rugs, etc. It will take a TON of the built up residues out of her room. (Also its satisfying AS FUCK.)\n\n\n2. If she can't remember to take the dog out regularly enough, and alarms don't help her remember, see about litterbox training the dog so its waste is more contained and sanitary. \n\n\n3. Borrow a high powered shop vac. Sprinkle the mattress generously with baking soda, let sit for as long as you can but at least half an hour, then vacuum. Flip it over and do the other side. Then use Nature's Miracle dog pee treatment to spot treat any stains on the mattress. (Even if they're people stains, the stuff helps break down the smell.)\n\n\n4. Get allergen-barrier pillow protectors and mattress protectors for her. \n\n\n5. If her room is carpeted, see if your parents are willing to switch it for something less odor absorbing and easier to clean (I switched my carpet to LVT vinyl tile and its so SO much easier to keep clean).\n\n\n6. I find it hard to keep my room clean if stuff is \"put away\" so I use either open shelves, clear bins, or wall hanging to keep my stuff organized in a way that doesn't leave me ripping everything out of all my drawers trying to Find The Thing. \n\n\n6. This sounds dumb but certain types of light make it harder for me to function and increase my brain fog. She may want to test out different types, colors, and brightness of bulbs until she finds one that feels right. \n\n\n7. Make sure her room has a couple different trash cans and hampers for dirty clothes; it's easier to remember to use them if you have several which are easily accessible. \n\n\n8. The tongue scraping thing may be a lost cause, but I find grooming is easier to do if it's fun. I'm a 36 year old adult brushing with a Lion King toothbrush, using kids watermelon toothpaste, and using alcohol free strawberry mouthwash. I only started scraping my tongue regularly when i got a pretty, shiny rose gold scraper that feels nice to touch. You might suggest that to her. It's better to do the thing than do the thing how boring adults want you to do it.  ;) \n\n\n9. I keep a clear plastic tote in my room for dirty dishes. That makes it easier to keep them contained and remember to take them to the kitchen. \n\n\nBeing 15 is hard. Just do your best to let her know you're on her side and want to empower her to succeed. This isn't your responsibility but your mom is treating this as a discipline issue and not using her problem solving skills to figure out what the issue is.",

Neglect is the most common form of child abuse, and it's very clear from reading your post and comments that this is what's happening.\n\nThis is the point where you have a chat with a guidance counselor or trusted teacher and tell them everything: your sisters issues, your parents being mental health deniers, how all of this is affecting your quality of life and ability to function.  Tell them you are worried about your sister and don't know who to turn to. You can also tell them that you don't want them to disclose that it was you who came forward. Your sisters hygiene is probably very clear to her peers.\n\nIf CPS becomes involved (which they should be) they won't apprehend you or your sister, but they will offer support and get a social worker or child advocate involved to help your family get on track.",

Your sister\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem to be functioning properly. Depression, anxiety, ADHD, or many other issues could cause this.

(Never stay in a hotel that doesn\u2019t use them).\n\nFirst step is to discuss your concerns with your parents and get them to step up. If they won\u2019t, then you\u2019ll need to talk to a teacher about your worries.

Having my bathroom set up the way that I like it and having towels in my favorite colors or prints helps me to get over the imaginary wall. \n\nMaybe some kind of incentive even would help... it may sound childish but make it like, okay if you shower, you can do/have/eat something you want. \n\nThe same idea with a body wash or soap maybe.

            "So I\u2019m gonna start out with saying you\u2019re a good sister for even caring enough to be worried about this. The older she gets the less kind people are gonna be about it, and they are a lot more blunt/rude then you could ever be. \nI used to be in your sisters boat, at that age I always thought \u201cwell I\u2019m just a kid and once I get older I\u2019ll make the needed changes.\u201d What I didn\u2019t realize back then is it\u2019s harder to kill old habits then it is to make new habits. It took my brother sitting me down and explaining it in a less then kind way. I\u2019ll give you some examples you could use later. \nSomething that helps me is leaving notes around the house. A simple post it note on the bathroom mirror will help her remember to brush her teeth and hair. For her bedroom if she always keeps her door closed put a post it on the outside of the door that says \u201cclean puppy pads\u201d and also put another one with the same wording right by her light switch. You can also put brush your teeth on her door and light switch. Constant reminders like that kinda drill it into your brain.\n\n\nThe best thing for you to do to really get through to her is be completely blunt honest with her. Sit her down and tell her that this isn\u2019t meant to degrade her but to help her understand that personal hygiene can go a long way. Even though she can\u2019t smell her breath(but honestly she probably does because of the masks) doesn\u2019t mean that the people surrounding her doesn\u2019t. Even with a mask on you can still smell it. Remind her that you are being adamant about it because you know how the real world can be for people like her and you are trying to make sure she doesn\u2019t get attacked/degraded by some stranger all because she has bad breath. Strangers are mean and they don\u2019t care if they hurt your feelings, but you care. That\u2019s why you\u2019re trying to help her realize that a little change can go a long way. Not only will it open the door for her to be harassed by strangers, kids at school, and even in the work place (which she can be written up for and lose her job) but it will make having a love life virtually impossible. Nobody wants to kiss someone who has bad breath but also has a gross looking tongue. Also when kissing you can tell when someone has plaque buildup on their teeth which is another huge turn off. Enough about the bad breath. You should also remind her that the poop and piss smell is soaking into her clothes and is beyond hard to get the smell out. Everyone in a ten mile radius can probably smell it and is looking for the cause of the smell. The smell of piss and shit isn\u2019t something she wants to be remembered for. \n\nIf talking to her doesn\u2019t help and if you\u2019re able to you should talk to her school counselor. Because talking to family doesn\u2019t always do the trick and something in our heads tells us they are just being mean for no reason. If she gets called into the counselors office she won\u2019t see it coming and it might be the kick she needs. \n\nSorry for the novel, I couldn\u2019t figure out a way to keep it short and simple.",

            "I have a friend just like your sister. She was diagnosed as an adult with ADHD, anxiety, and executive function disorder. Her parents live in their own reality and she was the middle child so it all just kind of got neglected and overlooked in her childhood. When I met her in college, being filthy and smelly in dirty clothes and living in a filthy dorm room was her normal state. She didn't even really understand how bad it was because her parents just...let her be like that. If her siblings tried to talk to her she'd brush it off as them being, you know, siblings. It wasn't until she was out in the world around 'normal' people and saw how other people lived that it started to dawn on her and even then it took *years*, like well into adulthood, for her to get any better about her cleanliness and habits. She's now married with a kid and their house is still in a general state of filth that would drive me absolutely nuts, but it's just...normal for them. My point is that you can't fix what's going on with your sister. Talk to her all you want but she's past the age where this can be corrected with a conversation. She's going to be a dirtmonster until she figures it out on her own and honestly it might never even happen.

            "Okay so I was in a very very similar situation with my brother. I am now 23, I moved out around a year ago because of this problem. My brother is autistic (I think, my parents refused to tell me his exact diagnosis, don't ask lol) but at the very least is severely learning impaired/socially impaired. He's 18 but acts more like a 14 year old. A big problem we've had with him is his hygiene. He's a big kid, super tall and pretty heavy, and a teenage boy. He would fake showering (turn the water on and not actually shower), not wash his hands, and not brush his teeth. He would smell sweaty/sour/unwashed and has rings of dirt around his neck. He also wouldn't change clothes and would not wash his sheets, at one point there was a huge black mark running the length of his bed on the wall just from his dirt rubbing on the paint, and when they moved his bed they found a mountain of trash and food wrappers he had been throwing under it. My parents have \"tried\" kind of, and this became a big point of contention in our relationship as I have ocd, and am also very sensitive to smells/certain sensory things like you. Hygiene and cleanliness/germs are a big trigger for me, so him sharing food without handwashing was a big issue. All I can say is, talk to your parents about it seriously, like an adult to an adult and share your concerns. I tried with my parents but it really just didn't work out. They claimed he was \"too old\" for them to do anything. Our relationship deteriorated to the point where I had to leave the house in one day because I couldn't take it anymore. But a year later I am in my own apartment that is clean and smells lovely. My relationship with my parents and brother are great now, because I can just leave whenever I need to. Hopefully you can work things out, but just be assured that it is not your job to work things out, so if it comes to the point where the best thing you can do for yourself and the other people around you is leave, then it's okay.

Sadly part of growing up is realising that you can't do anything about some people's behavior, even though it's frustrating because you think you're trying to help them. This might be disheartening, and probably not what you wanted to hear but sometimes you just have to accept it and focus on what you can do:\n\n* Making sure she keeps her mess to her room\n* If you experience overloads then try avoiding her before she's showered (or practice taking timeouts when you need them)\n* \"I\u2019m going to college in a few months so I won\u2019t be able to pick up after her and I don\u2019t want this to keep going into her adult life\".

Your sister is still young, there's plenty of time for her to change by herself. But even if she doesn't - it's unlikely you'll have to live with her again so you should just accept that's how she is and move on.\n\nI ended up moving out of Mum's house partially because of the bad hygiene as well as a bunch of other reasons. It was a great decision and being being able to live in a clean and tidy home is something a lot of people take for granted but I'm thankful for every day.

            "I went thru this with my step sister. I was 1.5 years older than her/a grade a head of her. She was that way due to her mom. Her mom was OCD about her own hygiene, and a petite person. My step sister was the complete opposite - only showered after her mom/my dad got onto her, never cleaned her room, never brushed her teeth, & would hoard food in her room. Her room smelled disgusting! I hated visiting my dad's on the weekend & would stay at my grandparents house whenever I could. I remember they had a house built & being so excited about getting my own room. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before her room was back to being a smelly pig pen! My grandma would buy me those plug ins from Bath & Body, as my room was right next door & I was scared my room would start to stink. We tried talking to her about smelling. All my friends made fun of her, so her mom hated my friends & they were never allowed over. My dad & her mom would eventually get fed up & clean her room, yet it would go right back to being gross. They would get on her ass about showering; her mom would even smell her hair afterwards to make sure she showered. We all went to Florida but my dad stayed home for work. He tore her room apart while we were gone bc he was tired of the smell & this is what he found...\n\n*WARNING: VILE INFO FOLLOWS*\n\nMy step sister had been shoving her used underwear all into her top dresser drawer. She would shower, but apparently would put her underwear back on until God knows when - then she would just shove it into her top drawer. I'm telling you, it was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen! I didn't even know underwear could turn that color! So even though she had been showering, she would just put on dirty underwear; we think she would just put a little bit of soap in her hair, but not really scrub her scalp or anything. She was just extremely lazy and I guess did not care.  Our grandparents bought us both new bedroom furniture sets, for our new bedrooms - she had been hiding food under her mattress & in this like small cubby that was built into her bed. There was even grease stains from chips and stuff, on her bed!\n\nMy dad ended up divorcing her mom, about a year later. So I didn't have to continue dealing with her. My half sister tells me things about her sometimes, as we share the same dad & she shares the same mom with her. She never ended up changing. Her hygiene is still the same. She's even had 3 kids with 3 different guys, plus a few abortions. I don't know how she even got a boyfriend, but the \"boys\" aren't exactly winners either. They are just as gross as her. She actually had her rights terminated thru the state bc her boyfriend beat her unconscious & held her oldest son hostage one night while the cops were trying to arrest him. CPS found out that she was living with him & ended up filing TPR. It's pretty sad, as they were all homed separately. Her teeth are like a green/black color, covered in a fuzzy substance. They look rotten. She's about 31 years old now & it's been a few years since my sister has even seen her - so she may even have lost some teeth by now. \n\nYou can't change your sister. The person who said you're enabling her, is completely right. Your parents can only do so much, too. Maybe she will change down the road? I'd just keep your distance.

            "I have a sister like this. By Im 26f and she is 24.once she caught an infection under her armpit that was so big that laying down her arm sat up at a angle instead of parallel to her body. We had to puncture it and press out all the putrid pus(it was alot about 8oz). She doesn't have insurance so I tried to drill in her that her hygiene plays a role in her health. She does nothing but stay at home as she works from home. But even before COVID, she was like this. She would go to work hair unwashed with dog and cat hair in it.(she never detangle or brushed it) she would put a scarf over her head and that's it. She wouldn't bathe for weeks. Her room smelled of her. Although the room stayed clean(clean room but dirty person?), her actually body permeated the space. That's also meant that it permeated the entire space around her wherever she went.\n\n We had many talks about it and she would simply shut down as you lecture her. she had no actual reasons for why she did that with her health. We ask if someone touched her and as a response she stopped bathing herself. She said no. We asked is there anything that is emotionally causing her problems, she said no. My sister is the definition of introverted. So she home all the time. Not interested in relationships or anything she might be asexual. So I never say anything about being with someone smelling like that. It would have negate what I was trying to instill in her. She never got like this until she became an adult.\n\nOnly after the infection under armpit did she start to bathe on a regular. She still from occasion not bathe for 2-3 days and won't wash her hair for a month or two but the maintenance had gotten better. I rarely smell her anymore. But I'm comfortable enough to tell her to bathe or wash her hair. There is no offense in it. Her health is serious tell her in a serious conversation. Sit her down and talk about it. Good luck.",

You need to stop cleaning her room for her; you are unwittingly continuing/perpetuating the babying that your mother does. I know it will be hard because of your sensory issues, but the cycle will not stop until **you** stop it. Your mother will eventually reach her breaking point. Your sister may even reach her breaking point when a boy she likes at school makes fun of her for her stink.",

Even more so that you can actually notice that they are not for a long time.\n\nHow is your sister doing mentally? Sounds like she has given up. I could imagine her being overwhelmed.

            "Obviously talk to your parents, but if your sister keeps dismissing your concerns as teasing, I think you need to be far more serious when you address this. Use the language you use in this thread-- you're moving to college in a few months and worried about her developing habits that will seriously impair her adult life. Like actually put aside time and have a serious talk with her, not necessarily just in reaction to something gross she does.\n\nYou'll rock the boat this way, but I think it's important it comes from you, as opposed to her having a future roommate or friend saying it first. Tell her that mom is sheltering her from reality and that you don't want her to have habits that will embarrass her in front of other people. That these are not normal habits and your parents are failing as parents in correcting this. Ask her how she would feel if she had friends come over and attempt to hide their disgust when they smell her or her room.\n\nThey're harsh points, but they need to be said.",

            "Honestly your sister sounds like she has a developmental disorder - this is NOT normal behavior. Most humans find the stench of urine and feces abhorrent and will keep it away from their living spaces - on a primal level, the instinct to avoid filth is pretty deeply engrained to prevent disease and decay. \n\nEven if the dog is a chihuahua - there is no reason to justify it eliminating in the house on a regular basis; does she have a physical disability that prevents her from walking the dog? If so, can anyone help her or does she have any mobility aids? Is the dog still a puppy and needing training pads, or has not walking the dog regularly gone on for so long that the dog has simply been trained to go inside instead of outside? I would encourage your mom to tell your sister that the dog cannot stay if she won\u2019t clean up after it; that might get her to change her behavior if only in relation to the dog. Also - the mattress should have a waterproof mattress protector on it too...\n\nDoes your sister act immaturely or incapable in other areas of her life as well? Does she have any friends? Have other people outside the family noticed and/or commented on her smell or lack of hygiene? Has she been teased or bullied for it? Was she home schooled? Is it possible your mother is enabling her because she doesn\u2019t actually believe she can do better? Does your mother also notice the smell? \n\nI ask all this because a family member of mine has a developmental disorder and he just ignores filth to the point that his bathroom gets so disgusting that you would never want to use it, let alone clean it for him.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to sound insensitive but there\u2019s not much you can do short of getting her a diagnoses and/or taking her to some life skill teaching courses. Other than that, it\u2019s not your responsibility and you can\u2019t force anyone to do anything. I would just focus on going to college as soon as possible and doing well so you can afford your own place and never need to live with her/smell her room again."

        "selftext": "Reddit, please help me. I'm at my wits end.\n\nThis is going to read like \"we see what we want to see\" but I assure you that's not the case. My husband and I have been married a bit over a year, we were together for 4 before that. Not long distance, normal relarionship, moved in together at around the 2 year mark.\n\nHe was damn close to perfect. Really he was. Even after the honeymoon phase wore off, damn close to perfect. \n\nHere's the guy I married:\n\nAttentive, sensual and comfortable with his sexuality, brave, honorable, honest, communicated well, respectfully told me when he took issue with something I had done and accepted criticism gracefully when I was upset with him, then we worked out the issue together and it STAYED fixed. A great mix of social and alone time - he didn't want to go out to much or stay in too much which was great for me because I'm very introverted with a touch of social anxiety. Nothing too bad, I'm just one of those people who never wants to go out.... then has a blast when I get there. He had a great job and goals and we were planning a great future. He was supportive of my career development (I was a late starter, went to college late). He was proud of me and always walked around like a preening peacock with me in public. We were That Couple, guys. \n\nHis ONLY faults were that he sometimes did what his mother wanted, even when it was more than a little unreasonable, but we set some boundaries with her and that got better, and he could be a little scatterbrained/inconsiderate in the way of he wouldn't ASK me about plans, he would TELL me the day before. I fixed that one by saying he was welcome to go alone, but if I made other plans and he hadn't told me, I was sticking with my other plans. \n\nThose are pretty minor things in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAll out friends told me I finally got it right, half of them would have happily dated him if we broke up. Not in a creepy way, just a \"You're super lucky, he's awesome, I've always had a little crush on him\" way.\n\nAnd then we got married.\n\nI have no ue who this man is anymore.\n\nWe nearly never have sex. He acts like he's asexual. Before, it was sexts and jumping me as soon as I walked in the door. Now its one position, with the lights off, once every 2 or 3 weeks. It's like he's self conscious and afraid of sex now. He stopped communicating. He hates everything about me. I'm Buddhist, he's agnostic, but he used to be interested in what I had to say about my beliefs. Very interested. I never tried to convert him, it's just a part of my life I value. He used to love intellectual and philosphical discussions about Buddhism, now he just tunes out or says \"ok\". That's his go to for anything. My needs, my thoughts, my feelings, my concerns, my likes and dislikes are all met with \"ok\". \n\nWe never go out anymore. I mean NEVER. I still sometimes go to events with friends, he isn't interested. \n\nHe quit his job without telling me because he \"hated it\" and took a job as a delivery driver for Amazon. This was like a $40k yr PAY CUT. There is no money for the training and class I need for my career. But yet he finds money for his collectibles and whatever he wants. If I ask, he says it's my problem. I need to fund my own advancement. Which would be right, to a point, except it would advance US. And he HAD been helping. He had agreed to continue to.\n\nHe does nothing around the house anymore. I was away for 4 days and came home to find stale food in the cat's dishes that had sat there since I left and they had no water. The younger is half Siamese and he was yowling anf going stir crazy because he hadn't been played with. He used to adore those cats and snuggle and play with them all the time. No laundry was done. There was a sink full of dishes. \n\nThe mommy issue is back. She says jump and he asks how high. Period. He spends entire days with her morning to night for days in a row. She has no health issues, this isn't a caregiver situation. When I've talked to him about it he says I don't \"understand\" what it's like to have family (I'm NC with my abusive mother, my father passed when I was 11, I have a brother who lives in another country). It feels personal. Like he rubs my nose in his family.\n\nHe's no longer a gentlemen. He no longer has my back and stands up for me. We have jerkwad neighbors who leave crap in our yard, are loud and obnoxious, and just generally assholes. One day I got in an argument with one of them because they were having a party and PARKING IN OUR DRIVEWAY and where my BF would have shown a united front, my HUSBAND told me to \"stop being hormonal\", looked at the neighbor and said \"You know how women are\" and HAD A BEER with him.\n\nReddit, I don't know this guy and I don't like him. Is this who he really is? I LIVED with him for 2 years and saw none of this. I wouldn't have married this asshole. He makes me feel like shit about myself and like I'm less than. I feel like I have a bratty teenager and not a husband. \n\nBut yet I saw nearly none of this. Like I said, just 2 minor issues. He was amazing. And now that I'm married to him I don't know him. Can someone really fake a personality 24/7 for 2 years? So well that none of their true self bleeds through? I don't want to spend my life with someone who hates me and everything about me, who is either zoned in front of the computer or at moms, who acts like I'm dipped in shit when I try to touch him. I wouldn't have married that guy. I thought I married an adult partner.\n\ntl;dr Husband did a total 180 after wedding. Why? What do I do?",

He's depressed - if this is the case, this change should be temporary and therapy would help. However, it's only going to work if he's willing. \n\n2. He faked it - your relationship was a complete lie up until the point that you got married. Once you were legally tied to each other, he stopped having to pretend to be interested, because he assumes you are stuck with him forever. \n\nSadly, my situation was an \"option 2\" where the moment we signed our marriage certificate, he dropped the act. \n\nMy recommendation would be to:\n\n1. Talk to him about the change and suss out if perhaps it is a depression issue\n\n2.

If he's operating on the assumption that marriage has \"trapped\" you with him, this'll dissolve that notion nicely. I wouldn't even try counselling.

The fact that this is a sudden development right after marriage is a clue.\n\nSeveral personality disorders (psychopath, borderline) manifest in relationships as \"I love you/I hate you.\"  They alternate between the \"attraction phase\" of a relationship and a \"rejection phase.\"  \n\nIn the attraction phase everything is wonderful, they are on their best behavior, they are trying to draw you in.  In the rejection phase they have succeeded at drawing you in and they are feeling secure (marriage), and so the rejection phase begins.

            "Jesus this sounds exactly like my ex-husband.  If you haven't heard of borderline personality disorder, please look it up.  I have the exact same story as you.  First two years of our relationship were literally perfect. He was attentive, polite and we got along better than I had ever gotten along with anyone in my life.  My mom literally told me that she'd disown me if I didn't marry this man.  \n\nWe got engaged and slowly things started to change.  We had a relatively short engagement, so there wasn't time for him to truly start showing me the red flags, but looking back, I can see where he began cracking.  Three days after our wedding, he was breaking dishes we got as wedding gifts just days before. Three months after our wedding, he trashed a hotel room on our belated \"honeymoon\" because I had the audacity to tell him that it was the perfect time to try for a baby (something we had both agreed on before the trip).  There was pretty much no sex in our marriage.  The one time in 3.5 years it happened, my son was conceived. \n\nWe were married a grand total of 4 years, together for almost 7. The four years we were married were the most mind-twisting, abusive times of my life.  No matter how much support I provided, it was never enough.  He was always the victim and everything was always my fault.  Like your husband, whenever he didn't like his job, he'd up and quit -- no notice and without telling me.  I was expected to support him for months on end when he decided he didn't want to look for a job.  Yet I had to go back to work from maternity leave over a month early because he wouldn't help out on the bills because I had used all of my savings for maternity leave paying for his bills the 6 months he was unemployed prior to our son's birth. \n\nAnd mommy issues?  Ugh, yes, I'm familiar with them as well.  But in my case it's both parents.  It actually just reared its head again this weekend! \n\nThere were numerous times I told him I was leaving.  Especially when he became violent after our son was born.  But every time he'd turn on the sane, loving husband act and fool me into staying.  He couldn't hold the act very long though.  Finally a year ago I said enough and our divorce was final the end of last year.\n\nPlease look into BPD and see if it matches what you're going through. If it is, I would recommend you begin seeing a therapist on your own to help you decide what you want to do next.  There are some great subs on here as well for loved ones of people with BPD if you determine that's what's going on with your husband.  \n\nHugs to you.  It sounds like you need it. ",

That's the problem, though: he saw it as an end goal, not a lifelong journey together.  Once he got married all effort stopped because there is nothing more to do, in his eyes.  He also probably feels resentful because now he is \"tied down\".  I doubt much of his behavior is that conscious, though.  It sounds like it is mostly due to patterns he has learned.  \n\nI'm sorry to say this, but its highly unlikely he will change.  He sounds very set in his ways and with the unconscious patterns he's displaying, he will probably never recognize just how f'ed up he's acting.

I didn't know who I was. Come to find out I had low T. Doc put me on some meds and I felt like my old self again. Unfortunately for me, it was a little to late with my girl. She was fed up. Felt unwanted, unappreciated, etc. Anyways, another aspect you should look in to is you. Are you an anxious person? Do you deal with depression?

Is there anything you could have done to make him suspicious?

Is it possible he got fired or otherwise let go and moved to the Amazon thing out of desperation? And now he resents you because of the cost of your education? How long after the wedding did he 'quit' and was his personality change evident before that point? If so how long before?\n\nI'm just throwing out ideas here because there's lots of possibilities.

We hear about this all the time in marriages.  Not just that there's a bait and switch, but that marriage itself is a kind of goal that appears to reset brain switches (or bring up latent issues).  Marriage is serious business for some people - and many people seem to change or absolutely do change after marriage (happened to me, first marriage).\n\nPart of it can be that the game changed.  Rules of courtship provide gamification of the relationship.  Once that's gone, some people deflate (even get depressed) and settle into a long haul mentality.  I think that's awful, but it does happen.\n\nAll the usual advice applies (counseling, etc) but OP, you need to also be thinking what you'll do if it doesn't change.  I think the sex issue is both a cause and effect of everything else, it could be worked on separately.  A sex therapist would probably say that any less than once a week is not good (biologically psychologically) and would require the lower libido partner to commit to initiating once a week (and keep track).  This has worked for thousands and thousands of couples, to restore some kind of intimacy, but also to reveal further problems (including if one partner is actually asexual - which it sounds like he is not).\n\nSeriously, this is a relationship on life support - and that's what you should tell him.  He's the only one with any clue about the answers.  ",

I try to not be a dick, but it's my life. I interviewed for a new job in a new city yesterday. I told them about the cancer (not all the gory details), so that if they hire me, they will never feel that I was dishonest with them. My suggestion to everyone is to live the life you want. Don't wait for cancer to teach you a lesson.  To the OP, do what you want to do. If you want to tell him, go for it. It could result in some amazing times in your remaining time. If he doesn't reciprocate, so what?  You haven't lost anything. If, in your heart, you think it's wrong to put some kind of pressure on him, then follow that path. It's your life. You get to choose.

And I thought if it was it was my fault bc it couldn\u2019t be his. \n\nSo I just wanted to thank the people of this subreddit for waking me up. I was in denial at first but you guys were right. I\u2019m so thankful for everyone who helped me. \n\nStay safe everyone \n<3",

            "Emotional/verbal abuse typically escalates at some point. I recently left my abuser and your story reminds me of our early years. In the coming weeks and months, there may be moments you miss him. Stay strong and remember you deserve better! So proud of you!",

            "Just read your whole story... you are so strong for deciding to leave. I wish I had done it when I was your age back when I was with my emotionally/financially abusive bf. It just took me so long to realize that he wasn\u2019t going to change no matter how many times I tried to explain to him my feelings and what he says/does sometimes hurts me. The part where you had poured your heart out and then he ended up making you cry which he then called you \u201cchildish\u201d just brought me back to so many times of my bf doing that exact same thing.\n\nI was so numb the first few months after the breakup but then I realized things hurt because I was numb for so long and now my heart had room/time to defrost. Now I am with the sweetest guy who not only is patient when I am emotional/insecure but constantly gives the reassurance I needed. Not saying that having a person makes your life complete, but I am saying that the person you think doesn\u2019t exist is definitely out there ready to treat you the way you deserve. They won\u2019t care about what you wear and will encourage you to be who you want to be. Just gotta figure out who you are and what kind of person you want to be with. Don\u2019t settle for anything less",
            "I am SO PROUD of you for getting out of that situation.",
            "Just read your original post, yeah you 100% did the right thing. Go enjoy (in safe way) exploring your sexuality. Dress how you wish and do what you wish (consenually) with whom you wish. As you grow you will hopefully learn that what you had wasn't love.\n\nMy SO never tells me how to dress, never calls me names, never goes through my phone even though they know all my passwords. \n\nEnjoy college life.",
            "What did he do when you broke up with him?",
            "There is such thing as being surrounded by people, and still feel alone. A partner is meant to enhance your life, not to complete it.\n\nI am glad you got out of it. Take this time as an opportunity to grow as a person, and fill in whatever gap you may have. That way, it will be easier for you to walk away when the next guy comes in, and acts like a jerk.",
            "Good for you! It feels hard now, but years from now, you will be glad you got away. It will get better. You won't feel like this. When you feel tempted to go back, just keep looking at the future and moving forward for yourself. \n\nDon't sit around feeling bad and thinking about him. Throw yourself into a new hobby, or school or career training. Do something for yourself, to make yourself better, for you. \n\nI would encourage you not to jump into another relationship. Being in an abusive relationship warps your sense of what's ok and what's not. You need time and hopefully therapy to help you heal from that. If you can do therapy, please do. ETA: Your school probably has a counseling center with free or low cost sessions.\n\nGood luck! You can do this!",
            "Oh thank god. I was worried about you. Halfway through that original post I was yelling at my phone. Under no circumstances should anyone be yelling at you, calling you names, and intentionally triggering your anxiety. Behavior like his only escalates as you try to do more and more to balance their fragile emotions and get things back to the way they used to be. Good riddance to him.",

            "Being single is hard yes but staying with someone emotionally abusive is far worse. It's better you left before he put it in your head you'd never find anyone else, nobody else will want you, etc. But he's wrong. You're only 19 you will find someone else. And if he tries contacting you telling you he's changed and wants you back. Don't. He will pretend to change and be nice to lure you in, let your guard down, then he will start again but worse. Just don't reach out or contact him. You're strong you can do it and you will find someone else which will show him you've moved on past him. Best of luck. <3",

I felt that way when I left my abusive bf. You can grieve, but please don\u2019t go back.  I didn\u2019t know why I was crying when he was gone. I felt guilty. I felt like I invested a lot. I got over it pretty quickly and realised it was tears of relief that this cycle was over and he was out. You\u2019ll be ok!!!",
            "I just want you to know that it's not that you weren't good enough, and it's not that no one will be good enough for him. He was a controlling partner, and will always try to be with someone he can control. He was telling you how to dress and that you couldn't hang out with friends. That has nothing to do with you, and everything to do with him. You are good enough, and one day you will find someone who will be overjoyed to get to be with you as you are. \n\nI was also the shy, boyfriendless loner in high school, and I figured I'd die alone as well. I'm 25 now, have had a small handful of relationships since high school (some good, some not good), and am now with a wonderful fella who loves me for who I am in my entirety.",
            "Oh my dear. I just read your original post and update. I'm so sorry all this happened. I am SO glad you got good advice and were able to realize how he was abusing you. \n\nIt's hard to end a relationship. Be proud of yourself for being strong enough to see it was toxic and taking that hard step. \n\nYou're young. Be free. Love yourself and find someone who loves AND respects you. \n\nBe well.",

I would be very surprised if you didn't have don't serious, life-long scars from him.\n\nAlso, maybe explore why you put up with that nonsense for do long? Your first post said that he made you feel loved for the first time. \n\nWhat was your home like life? Do you have a healthy male role model?",
            "That's how toxic people get to you. 0% of this was your fault, but somehow you has yourself convinced that you should do more to make it okay. I am happy to hear you're out of such a bad situation.",
            "I left my emotionally abusive ex 8 years ago. I was so unsure just after the breakup, but I promise you\u2019ll reach a point where you don\u2019t even think of him anymore except to thank your past self for caring for your future self enough to leave.",

Someone who can make you feel like a partner and make you feel even better about yourself than you'd feel without him, rather than make you feel worse.\n\nMy goal from the time I started dating my wife, well over 40 years ago, to today has always been to let her know I appreciate her and how great a woman she is.  That's because I truly love her and that's how you treat someone you love.  There are plenty of us out there.",
            "Way to go! I'm proud of you- though I, luckily, didn't live with my controlling and manipulative ex, it took me a long time to figure out i want being treated right, and even then I didn't get the strength to break up with him- he left me.  Thankfully I realized it before going back to him. That was years ago now, but I'm so much better off- those were the hardest months of my life since I'd built my future around him and loved him deeply...but honestly once I figured things out and learned to be myself again, I'd never been happier. I was single for a while and met my (now) husband when I wasnt looking for someone- but he was sweet and he's never once called me names, doesn't disrespect me or distrusted me- I have a bunch of friends that I can talk to happily now, and honestly he'd trust me to hang out with even my guy friends alone (I'm straight). We both could look through the other's phone whenever, but he doesnt ask me to because he knows I wouldn't do anything. I waited for MONTHS for the other shoe to drop, for him to show some sign that he was going to get controlling or mean if I did something he didn't like... and it never happened. I go out, I have hobbies, I go to work, I have friends we share and friends that are mostly mine, and behind it all I have a husband (and a toddler now!) who support and love me and want me to be happy. We've been married 8 years now.\n\nAnyway, that's just to say that I can't wait for you to find out how awesome you are without him,  and then one day to find someone who treats you with the unconditional love, trust, and respect people should get and everyone deserves to have. It'll blow your mind just like it did mine :)",

He likely has deep emotional problems and it\u2019s not your job in a relationship to be a punching bag for anyone. I\u2019m happy for your future :) as I typed this, the sun came out from behind the clouds for the first time all day. I think the world agrees too \ud83e\udd70",
            "I\u2019m really really proud of you. I left my emotionally abusive ex this year too and it was terrifying. I went into a pandemic not knowing where I was gonna live or if I could find a job to even support myself. \n\nI got lucky and found my partner and holy hell does he make me happy. He\u2019s kind and respectful, understanding of my boundaries, he listens to me, and above all else I matter more than ANYTHING to him. When I do something that upsets him, I still feel all the love and affection from him I normally do. \n\nI\u2019m also bi and this was something my ex took advantage of. He was on tinder \u201clooking for a girl for a three way\u201d that I didn\u2019t consent to, he would get mad at me when I didn\u2019t want to have a three way with someone else. My identity was a toy to him that he would get upset when I\u2019d withhold. My current partner celebrates my identity and never makes me feel like he\u2019s using it. We\u2019ve also talked about three ways, but I\u2019m involved in the conversation and have my own voice in the discussion. I asked if I can go all out and decorate our front yard for pride and he enthusiastically said yes. \n\nI say this to let you know that there is someone out there who will be the partner you deserve. Someone who doesn\u2019t vilify you for being bi, someone who trusts you to wear a crop top outside, and doesn\u2019t need to search through your phone. I was 25 when I found my partner. It may take you some time but don\u2019t settle for anything less than everything you want. There\u2019s so many people out there that will love and celebrate you exactly as you are.

            "Hey don't get back with him.  I broke up with a guy for the same reason like 15 years ago.  We ran back into each other 8 years ago and got back together.  I thought he changed, he did not.  There is this saying I truly believe \" A woman gets into a relationship hoping to change the man.  A man gets into a relationship hoping that the woman doesn't change.  Both realize how gravely mistaken they are.\"",
            "It gets better, I promise. I left my emotionally abusive ex for similar reasons, I just wasn\u2019t good enough for him and never would be because I couldn\u2019t fit to be who he wanted, and that\u2019s okay. We\u2019re still in occasional contact and we\u2019re both working on ourselves, but we\u2019re happier apart. \n\nI\u2019ll be honest, you are definitely going to feel like you love him for a long time. You may even want to go back to him and just \u201cfix\u201d things and make everything \u201cnormal\u201d again, but you know you shouldn\u2019t do that. Time will heal it, time will take the love away. If you ever start to doubt your decision, just know that when thinking of him you\u2019re likely only thinking of good memories and if things were that good, you never would\u2019ve broken up in the first place.\n\nBest of luck. <3",
            "Become your own person. At this point you may not know who \u201cyou\u201d is because so much of your formative years have been spent centered around this person but you will find it in time. Don\u2019t obsess over finding someone else right now, just take the time to do things that you wholeheartedly enjoy and hang out with the people that truly bring you joy. Become comfortable with yourself and take the chance to be selfish! This is the best way to heal. Don\u2019t let him manipulate you into going back to him. He just wants his emotional punching bag back. You WILL find someone who loves you for you! There are so many men and women who only have love in their hearts and are itching for someone to give all that to. Stop saying you gave all your life to him, your life is just beginning.

People like this are a disease and they rot you from the inside out. You are 10000x better off without him!\n\nI always think to myself, I wish I never went through my abusive relationship, but it does mean now that I can always see the signs whether it's me dating someone or it's one of my friends talking about the same thing, or about someone their friend is seeing etc., and hopefully can help them see it before it's too late.",

Likely because you two just broke up, and abusers are going to be more shocked by the lack of control than anything else, he's going to try to get you back under control. Block him from all social media and block his number. Tell all your friends and family they are to not tell him about you regardless of the reason. And then avoid him, sometimes meaning changing your schedule to deliberately avoid him. \n\nIt's better to be alone than to be with toxic/abusive people",

            "Thanks for the update, and wishing you the best. To be clear - it\u2019s not about anyone being good enough for him. His issue is not with the caliber of the people he dates, but with his own insecurities, his misperception, his anger issues. You are good, and you are good enough, and you never need to change who you are for someone else. Ultimately, he had a problem with your personal (and bodily) autonomy. Autonomy is the most important thing we have as individuals, and no one has the right to take that away from us. Anyone who thinks their own feelings are more important than your bodily autonomy is not a person who deserves to be with you. \u2764\ufe0f",

            "I'm so glad to see this update. I was in a relationship for 6 years that is eerily similar to yours and getting out of it was one of the hardest things I've done. It probably doesn't mean much coming from an internet stranger but I'm really proud of you. \n\nIf you're open to advice, I highly recommend that once you get everything out of the apartment and take care of any leasing things, don't tell him where you are. Block his number, his social media, everything. Change your passwords, tell your friends and family that he is not to have any of your contact information. I made the mistake of telling my ex where my new apartment was and didn't block him for a while and he would show up randomly at my apartment and reach out begging for me to take him back. It was terrible and hard and not something you should have to go through. \nAlso, if you're not currently in therapy, I highly highly recommend trying to find a therapist to talk to. There is going to be a lot to unpack in the coming months and years, and there will be things that only a therapist can help you work through. 3 years later and I'm still discovering unhealthy things that I do that are a direct result of long term emotional abuse at a young age / first relationship. \n\nWishing you all the best. If you need someone to talk to, just let me know.",

He'll try to come back, and baby don't let him. \n\nMy ex started like that and eventually escalated to hitting me, and when I broke up with him he started soft stalking me. Please be safe, and surround yourself with people who really love and care about you. Blessed be, I'll keep you in my thoughts love !!!",
            "That's wonderful.\n\nI want to point out something that you may have realized yourself, but I'm going to mention it just in case because I didn't see it brought up in the last thread:\n\n>now i'm resenting my bisexuality because it caused a series of events that lead to me ruining the only good relationship in my life and i don't even know why. i wish i just kept it to myself.\n\nIf you feel isolated and alone and like no one will ever love you, it's because your boyfriend convinced you to think that way. He was the one who told you not to hang out with other males, and also started questioning you when you hung out with females. The only reason why he was \"the only good relationship in your life\" was because he forced you to cut off *all of your other good relationships*.\n\nAbusers isolate their victims. He did this to you SPECIFICALLY to make you feel like he's the only one in the world who will be there for you. He makes this true by convincing you that you don't need anyone else. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy. DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS LIE.\n\nGood men do *not* do this to the women they love. They encourage their partners to go out and make connections and have full social lives.\n\nI am constantly introducing my girlfriend (who is also bi) to all of my friends (including other men) and encouraging her to hang out with them, ALONE, WITHOUT ME. I know she's loyal. She has no limits, because I trust her (and also because she's an adult and not my property lol). I want her to be happy. And I know that I cannot be the only person in her life.\n\nThis is neither revolutionary, nor spectacular. It does not make me a great boyfriend. Because this is the BARE MINIMUM STANDARD that you should expect from your man.\n\nThis is what trust looks like: not snooping through your phone, not having access to all of your social media, not telling you to cut off your friends. But letting you do as you please, knowing that you are loyal.\n\nPlease go out and reconnect with all of your friends that he forced you to abandon. And never let another man (or woman!) stand between you and your friends ever again. You deserve to have a rich life full of friends and love. You do not ever, EVER need to rely on a single person for this ever again.\n\nNow go out there and thrive.",
            "I am so so glad that you moved on from this relationship. In know way do you or anyone deserve the stress that he seemed to have put you through. No girl ever should be called a slut. EVER! By any many. Even if she is technically a slut she should never ever be called that. It is the most disrespectful term I can think of towards a woman and you are blessed that you don\u2019t have to deal with a guy who does that. \n\nBreak ups are really hard even if you are the one who broke up with him. In time you will get used to the feeling of being single. The best way to get out of break up depression is to make sure you accomplish little tasks every day. Like you can tell yourself, \u201ctoday I am going to watch my lectures.\u201d Or other small task that we usually find really difficult to do when we go through a break up.\n\nNow that you are single you can focus on yourself. Work on you. Work out more, read a book, do really well in all your classes. Remember that you are an independent woman and you do not need a man to make you happy. So live your happy independent life without a man that will pull you down.",
            "Dude I keep hearing this damme story, I HAD this same story which lead to me breaking up with my first ltr. What is with the distrust of bisexual people?? My ex was furious with me having queer friends and seriously policed my friendships and me bc in their paranoid straight mind, it threatened our 'straight' relationship. Granted, I did say I wanted to lose my virginity to same sex, but I meant it as a \"what a delightful turn of events!\" My ex read it as \"I want to be gay and cheat on you and your genitals aren't enough.\" On the contrary, I hear another route that's taken: My friend came out to her bf and the next (and thankfully last) year was composed of him following her around like a gnat in her face, begging for a threesome, because yeah, that's appropriate, I guess, somehow? If I squint way way down and take enough acid, maybe that will start to make sense. I'm glad you left him.",
            "Wow I just want you to know how absolutely fuccckkkingggg impressed I am with your ability to remove the veil and your feelings from the problem and realize what the right thing to do and how wrong he was for treating you this way. Especially with all the factors added in to it being your first love, losing your virginity, first kiss, being young, ect. Not saying that age has anything to do with these factors because I'm 26 and you're handling this so much better than I'd be able to!! \n\nAs much as you're saying that people on here have helped you through this rough time, just know that this has touched me and I'm sure will reach so many other people. You're strength and ability to listen to your head over your heart when you didnt even realize at first how toxic and wrong the self blaming was .... just chefs kiss!! I dont know you but I'm so proud of you. \n\nI hope you never underestimate how powerful and strong you are. Whenever you're struggling please come back to this to remind yourself how much of a queen you truly are. Like I said, I'm 26 and I wouldn't have been able to handle this situation like you have now nevermind when I was 16. I have a lot of ... insecurities and growth to do with learning to love myself and believing in myself from never receiving that growing up. I can realize problems and know it's not just my fault or anything I'm doing, but I still will accept disrespect or have accepted it because of that lovely trait I have called co dependency \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude09\nI've now been with my boyfriend who was the \"nice guy\" who I would never before have even given a chance because I just loved being treated like shit.... lmao but giving him a chance was the best thing I ever did. Weve been together for 7 years and hes never called me a name, not saying we havent had problems or issues but, that being said hes never made me believe that theres something wrong with me. That I'm not good enough or that he did such and such because something's \"wrong\" with me. \n\nAnyways, I dont want to make this about me or my suitcase of problems. I just wanted to unpack a little to let you know why this touched me so much. Its so much easier to tell someone what they should and shouldn't do when it's not your relationship with your bu lls hittt savior complex getting in the way. We alllll know what we should do but it's not as easy to go through with it. \n\nI've written soooooo much now so I'm gonna shuttupp.  I literally just made my boyfriend pause his xbox so I could gush about how much of a rockstar you are. Btw he totally agrees! Thank you for posting this. \u2764\n\nEDIT: Oh and baby, I completely forgot to touch on this.. we don't slut shame in this house!! Girls are allowed to do anything a man can and even if you have been with 20 guys and went outside in some booty shorts and under boob showing tshirt on with no bra..... youd look bad as shhh-ttt and anyone who says otherwise, just say \"baybeeee your insecurities are showing\" be who you wanna be and dress in whatever makes you feel your best. Sleep with however many men or WOMEN you want to. Anyone who has anything negative to say is just showing a reflection of their insecurities. && if and when you meet someone new, your past is none of their concern.

I mean I understand why people just wanna quit relationships but I really hope you gave it a shot after learning that he needs help. Most people with controlling behaviour don't actually know what they're doing to the other person. And it's sad because they either end up alone or cause unhappiness to the person they're with due to situations when people reject them because it reinforces their beliefs.

            "Hey, I'm really proud of you.",
            "We are all proud of you.\n\nYou learned a few very valuable lessons here. You learned that your love can be manipulated. You learned that relatinships aren't always what they seem, and that you need to ignore your heart and listen to your head every once in a while. You learned that your best friend really IS your best friend. \n\nAnd you learned that you have it in you to stand up for yourself, even if it means ending the only relationship you've ever known.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the most important lessons in life are also the most painful.\n\nBut you learned them, and you are better for it. Because you won't let someone gaslight again you into thinking things are your fault when they aren't. You will see the red flags before you get overcommitted. And you learned you have the strength, courage, dignity, and self respect to not let this happen to you again.\n\nAnd with that comes a sense of confidence that can't be faked and can't be taught. And that kind of confidence is a VERY attractive trait for others. As long as you hold potential partners to the same standards you will now hold yourself, you will do very very well in relationship life moving forward.\n\nI know it hurts. I know it's scary. I know it's sad. But those feelings will fade over time. And you will be left feeling a sense of pride that will carry you forward.\n\nWe are all very proud of you, and on behalf of all of us, please give your friend the biggest hug in the world. She's one of the good ones.",

Because, girl, find yourself someone who reads other books than just facebook\n\nIf you are looking for the bright side on this shit-cloud, take it from me who stayed for 3 years in a phyiscal and emotionally abusive relationship. It is better you learn it now/one day, than never. Because you will never live up to his expectations - because there is nothing wrong with you. It's their problem and they are too proud to see it.",

I can only think of two couples who met in high school and stayed together. (I'm OLD!)\n\nYou will think about it, ponder it, and learn from it, but remember that love is always waiting. Whether it's the love of a partner, a friend, a child or a pet, love is part of this world and will always be a part of you in some way.\n\nCherish the experience but learn from it. Most important, love yourself and learn to be *alone* with yourself. \n\nBeing alone isn't nearly as scary as it first seems, when you start realizing how many *other* people in your life love and care about you, and that they are still there for you. Your friend has made that clear!\n\nAll the best of luck to you!",

            "I\u2019m sorry you had to go through this, but in a way I\u2019m proud of you too. I also had a boyfriend (6 years older than me) who would try to bully me and call me names when he was upset or insecure to put me in my place. I stayed with him for quite a while until I lost all respect for him and left. I kept going back when he told me he would \u201cchange\u201d or \u201cimprove\u201d but it was always the same shit. I recommend to never go back, true love has no place for violence, verbal, emotional or physical. I hope you\u2019re doing well.",
            "I read both post. I am a girl myself i would like to give you some advise. \n\nAt first, you are beautiful. Don't let any boy/girl or boyfriend/girlfriend tell you otherwise. \nAt second, you are always allowed to wear the heck you want. No matter how revealing, your bf/gf can tell you they find it too revealing but never change if you think that ain't true. They don't control you. \nAt third, i think it is very stupid that he wanted to look into your phone so much. If any bf/gf ever ask so much to look into your phone, they don't trust you and talk to them. Communication is key. If you can't talk a normal conversation with them. They don't deserve you. \n\nAnd as last. This will hurt and i am very sorry. But it will fade, i promise. And in the meantime, eat icecream, watch movies with your best friend, they are there for you, you just have to ask. Do fun stuff. And don't rush into another relationship if you ain't ready. I read he was your first, that is totally fine. But even with your second, third fourth, etc. Dont rush yourself into doing something you dont want to do. Or you are not comfortable doing with that person. Your opinions/dicisions matter. \n\nWith love and many hugs.",

I left him just 2 months before our wedding.  IT was scary to be single but I decided to stay single for at least 2 years, get therapy, and really REALLY learn how to love myself and set better standards for how I want to be treated.  I met my husband at 33 and we married when I was 37.  I am SO glad I made room in my life for him by dumping my abuser.\n\nHugs to you.  You are brave and strong",

As for the loner thing, you\u2019re in such an amazing time in your life where you can build yourself to be who you want to be.

Those types exist!",

I\u2019m thankful you\u2019re in a physical safe place and able to distance yourself from him, especially thankful you removed yourself from an unhealthy relationship.\n\nIt\u2019s good you recognized that deserve respect. Being single can be scary, especially when you\u2019ve been in a relationship for a long time, but take this time to get to know yourself, what you want, and what your interests are.",
            "I was abused for a year before I realized that I'd rather live alone than the way I was living.  Why is being single so scary to so many of us?   In the end I loved being single.  I had no one to answer to.  I did what I wanted when I wanted and I learned that when someone makes me think I'm not good enough, it's not me that has the problem, it's them.  \nHe had low self esteem and so making me feel I did nothing right made him feel better because that's what he felt like and misery loves company.\n So he wanted me to feel as low or lower than he felt so he could feel better about himself.  \nSomeone can only make us feel bad about ourself if we allow them to.  By staying and trying to make them love us only feeds them and gives them what they need.  You become their scape goat.  While  treating them with a gentle heart is attractive to them, but they can't maintain the relationship, because they need to feel better by making someone else feel bad too. \nThese people need therapy to help them, we think showing them love and affection will help them, but it doesn't and we can't.\nYou deserve better.  When you're not happy in a relationship it's time to ask yourself why.  Being single should not be scary for us.  We should all be able to be single.  Do you have family and friends?  If so, you are not alone.  A bad relationship is not better than no relationship.  No relationship is just temporary, and in the meantime, you'll learn important things about who you are, what you want in a bf/gf.  You'll learn how to recognize true love, because we don't really love someone that abuses us.  How many people end up staying with the first person they ever felt they loved?  Some, but not many.  Dating is like trying on clothes, you take a lot of things you think you like into the dressing room, but find that they don't all fit in a way that makes you look your best.  You don't buy them all, you only buy what fits perfect and makes you feel happy when you wear it.  It's even more important with a SO... Marriage should be for life.  It takes 2 years to really know if you love someone.  You could be infatuated or obsessed with them, but that's not love.  \nYou did good, I'm proud of you, I know it's not easy, but you took the first step to finding your path to happiness.  We need to be happy with ourselves and not depend on other people too make us happy.  No one should expect that from anyone.  It's no one's job to make us happy.  The happiness in a relationship, comes from being with someone that brings us joy when we're with them.  We should not expect it from anyone,  and no one should expect that from us.  That's how we get disappointed. We expect things we don't get, we become disappointed.  We have to learn not to expect anything, then whatever is given is a gift\nWhen I got divorced I was afraid to be single again, but I was happy, because think of it this way....if every time you saw someone they hit you in the head, then when they are gone there's no more headaches and that alone makes you happy.  \nSo I hope you find your happiness in being single.  We all need to learn how to be by ourselves.  It's a great life lesson!",
            "It\u2019s not that you\u2019re not good enough for him. He\u2019s not good enough for you. You deserve way better. You\u2019re also too young to be scared of being single; being single allows you to discover who you really are and it\u2019s a great adventure. I wish you well and I am so damn proud of you for breaking up with him!",
            "Good for you!!\n\nLeaving a relationship is scary, and painful at first because it\u2019s hard to adjust to having constant companionship to suddenly having a lot of alone time. And, I know going through that during COVID adds an extra layer to it. But, I hope you\u2019ll soon learn that being single isn\u2019t anything to be afraid of! \n\nSpend some time feeling your emotions, and then focus on doing what you like to do, wear what you want, see who you want, and spend every day the way that you want to (if that\u2019s spending \u201ctoo much time\u201d online or just being out and about, or napping, who cares!)\n\nNobody has a right to dictate how you live your life, whether you love each other or not. This is the most important thing to take away from this experience. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, you don\u2019t have to tiptoe around because the other person is doing work, or being worried that you spending time online is annoying. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s your time and your life. \n\nI really urge you not to jump into another relationship anytime soon, even though I know it\u2019s tempting when the opportunity comes around. You don\u2019t even know what you don\u2019t know yet. Give yourself time to learn it, to experience the world without someone else\u2019s criticism or commentary, and then find the person who fits with what you want from life - and who doesn\u2019t expect you to bend over backwards to suit them. \n\nGood luck, OP. You can do this and you\u2019ll be amazing! I\u2019m so excited for you.",
            "Am man, he was not a cool guy, you did the right thing.",

            "The right thing to do isn't always the easiest. There are lessons learned and you are heading in the right direction. You will get through it and more importantly, better than where you started. \n\nTake back that control he had over you. But don't be too afraid to love again in the future. Life is messy, you are experiencing that right now. We all are. Again with lessons learned, you'll be better and one day, find happiness not only with yourself, but with the right partner.  Good luck and be safe. You finally be you.",
            "Being single feels scary at first, but it\u2019s really great in a lot of ways! You get to learn more about yourself and feel confident in who you are. Then when you start looking to date again, you have a better sense of what you want and what your boundaries are. Best of luck!",

Oh btw how do you know you are bi if you have only committed sexual acts with one person ( a male).  Just curious.",
            "From one bi girl to another, it's not worth dating anyone who sees our sexuality as a negative thing. It's not even worth dating someone who ignores our sexuality (acts like we're straight / lesbian depending on who we're dating).\n\nGood on you for advocating for yourself.

            "I'm so happy for you. There will be a lot of decoding in the coming months and years. When I started dating again, there were things that I did and ways that I felt that were at odds with the the person I was with and how they felt. I realized that these behaviors were remnants of my relationship with my ex. One example being feeling extreme guilt for \"noticing\" other people. When I confessed this to the guy I was dating because of how horrible I felt he was very confused. Turns out healthy and well adjusted men understand that crushes and attraction to other people outside of your committed relationship is normal, healthy even! Who knew? \n\nMy advice to you is to always be asking yourself: am I happy? Am I healthy? If I had known to ask myself that (truly ask myself, and not lie about) I would not have been in out of that toxic relationship wayyy earlier. If you ever answer no to that question, the next step is to do something about it. You are a strong and beautiful person. Don't entertain any leeches!",
            "I'm glad you got out of that abusive relationship, it was definitely doing you more harm than good. \n\nHowever, as a fellow nineteen year old, I feel I should stress to you please don't feel afraid about being single.

In case no one's posted it, you may want to read the lingo at r/raisedbynarcissists to prepare yourself for how he may escalate things in case he can find you still. Some tactics are pretty common in men with women-hating psychological issues, though the sub is primarily based around narcissistic families, which it sounds like he may have grown up in. Don't let that make you feel sorry for him though. Any attempt of him being sweet now is likely to backfire into a vocal barb at best or a theft/assault at worst.
