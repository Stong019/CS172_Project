I just wanted to give the community an update. My wife finally got back yesterday from leaving to go see her sister. We talked for a little bit yesterday, but still came to the same thing she has been telling me. She doesn\u2019t want to be with me because she doesn\u2019t feel in love, emotionally connected, or intimate towards me. She views me as a friend. I told her she needed to choose either we work on this and go to counseling or it\u2019s a divorce and we cut ties. She couldn\u2019t decide and said to give her the weekend. \n\nThis morning I woke up early, made her breakfast and brought it to her in bed. Then took her out to eat for lunch and desert trying to just spark anything to see if she would agree to work on it. Well we sat down again after getting back and she said she wanted a divorce and she was 100% on that. \n\nIt was tough. A lot of crying, sadness, hurt, and all the emotions one would feel. I ended up just going to my room and she left for the night. I decided to get out and do something so I jogged and listed to some music for a bit. It helped. \n\nI came to the realization that we all have such little time on earth and I don\u2019t want to waste it moping around. I want to improve myself physically, emotionally, and mentally. I want to just enjoy life and find myself again. So I\u2019m going to do that and one day I might meet someone who is perfect to continue the journey of life with me. \n\nSo I\u2019m still sad and hurt, but all that to say I\u2019m moving forward and trying to be positive. Thank you all for your support.\n\ntl;dr Wife wants a divorce. I\u2019m trying to stay positive and move one.",

            "The end of a relationship is hard but it\u2019s also such a great opportunity for growth, self compassion, and fun. The initial part of the separation is hard but just know that you will be okay, slowly things will get better. \nYou\u2019re still so young, you\u2019re going to find someone that\u2019s a better match for you. Just give yourself time to grieve and take care of yourself. When my bf and I broke up I listened to \u201cBreakup Recover Podcast\u201d by Barbara Stevens, she\u2019s so calming and has a way of making you feel cared for and safe. There were days where I felt like shit but I would force myself to listen to it and I never regretted it. \nHope you find happiness within yourself soon!",
            "I\u2019ve come to know that most relationships \n are temporary, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t spark joy and laughter. This decision was hard to come to but the love and care you have for each other will always remain.  Allow yourself to truly experience self discovery and to focus on bettering it- take a class, learn a new language, try to find new and exciting purposes.",
            "I read your original post and I just want to say that I\u2019m sorry and I\u2019m really proud of you. You know that you have done absolutely everything you could have done to try and maintain this marriage. As you move forward in your life you won\u2019t need to question if it was something you did or if there was something you could have done better; this marriage ending is completely on her. You are willing to take criticism and improve on your shortcomings, you compromise and work as a team player, you persevere and you show compassion. You are a wonderful partner and now you\u2019ll have the freedom to find someone who will be just as willing as you to put everything into your relationship. I wish you all the best as you heal and eventually feel ready to find someone new!",
            "I got divorced at 28 (my partner also requested it after I felt I had done everything I could do) and it was hard at the time but ended up being the absolute best thing that ever happened to me. Hang in there, treat yourself kindly and follow your dreams, I'm sure you will thrive. All the best.",

In time you might come to find this was the best thing for you. \n\nI\u2019m your age and from age 17-25 I was with the same guy and although we didn\u2019t actually make it to marriage we were pretty close with cohabitating and having a dog together etc. That relationship ended and it was very difficult but it has afforded me the opportunity to make changes in my life and finally live the way I wanted to. This is all to say that you should keep hopeful and work on yourself. Good things are still to come!",

If nothing else maybe we could give some insight to each other, I mean if you want it.",
            "I feel you man. After my fiancee broke up me with me this year I also started to take care of myself much more and it feels great!\nI would recommend a podcast called The Minimalists. Maybe start off with these like I did:\nEpisode 158 about selfcare and episode 148 about breakups.\nI also started intermittent fasting and that really helped me achieve the goals I wanted body wise",
            "I\u2019m so sorry. Divorce is really painful. I  also am very freshly divorced following some very traumatic shit. \nIf I could offer you some grains of advice? People are going to say things like \u201cyou\u2019ll find someone new and better\u201d or the like, and I for one know how fucking incredibly hurtful that can feel when you are mourning the person you wanted to be with. The idea of dating again feels nauseating. Trust your gut and give yourself time. The expectation should never be to rush in to the next relationship, though some people will act like it is.\nWhat I can say is that being alone is okay too. You want to let yourself feel the feels. Divorce can hurt so much. The grief is literally so painful and can hurt worse than experiencing the death of that person, because they are still here and you can\u2019t have them. This is normal, and no one will be able to shoulder it for you, but it will get better in time. I think I spent an entire month straight crying, like real crying. I thought the grief was going to kill me. \nTwo things that helped the most were a solid mindfulness practice, and getting in to my own place. I paid for a subscription of Headspace for a guided meditation approach, and there are great programs. I am in a month long \u201cdealing with sadness\u201d routine. I can say with 100% honesty that I am different -and better- on the days I wake up and commit to meditation before starting my day. For real, for real. \nIn regard to the place, my former husband and I had a magical home and I had to stay and get it sold, after he moved away out of the state. Being in that home was insane torture. I closed last Friday, and moved last Sunday. Last Sunday was hard, I cried hard when I drove away the last time, but guess what? I haven\u2019t cried since, of even felt the need to. Get in your own space, and get a few things for yourself if you are able. \nAll in all, sorry to ramble, this is just fresh for me, 1. Find peace within so that you are bringing your best you to the table IF YOU DECIDE to date again, being solitary is also okay, 2. Get in your own space. It may not be perfect in physicality, but it will be perfect because it is your own, 3. Let yourself have the feelings, and give yourself permission to let those feelings go when they no longer serve you, 4. Stay sober",
            "26 is so young, and you still have so much time to build the life that you want. Keep that positive outlook, and my condolences regarding the end of your marriage.",
            "I read your original post, that's extremely odd behavior on her part. I'd also point out that you went beyond trying to fix your marriage and became a doormat.\n\nI would also suggest speaking with a lawyer in regards to an annulment instead of a divorce. Your post implies the marriage was never consummated and my understanding is an annulment will relieve you of the obligation to pay any sort of alimony or future support.",
            "I hope you can get through it well buddy.",
            "The end of a relationship/marriage is always tough. Just keep your head up and ride it til it passes. Some days will be tougher than others. Just stay focused on yourself and best of luck to you.",
            "These posts hurt my soul and my fundamental understanding of relationships. Obviously my understanding is flawed and incomplete. I wish you the best of luck. Just know I met my now wife and mother of my child when I was 24. Stay strong and be the best you buddy.",
            "Things will get better. Im glad that you're staying composed and want to congratulate you for handling it the way you did. Good luck \ud83d\udc96",
            "I am sorry OP.\n\nBut one thing that stands out to me: you've bended over backwards for this person. Did the emotional and all the other work for her, as she demanded it! Glad that in the end you asked she'd show up for this marriage or quit. She knew immediately she wanted to quit. \n\nI (35F) have had a tendency to also invest myself heavily in my couple, to care more and to be passionate, to remove obstacles for my other half. To accept being friendzoned and taken for granted, while I'm passionately invested. Not anymore! Am single for a year and built a fabulous life. I won't date again until I found someone who is as invested, enthusiastic, who communicates well and makes sex and intimacy a priority. Someone who passionately loves who I am and who has a healthy amount if self-love.\n\nBeing a couple is about being a team, loving on each other and going on an intimate adventure as lovers (sex, intimacy, love). It's about supporting each other. \n\nShe just took and took and didn't give much. Work on feeling well and tour self-esteem. You're worth finding someone who is a proper adult and who cherishes you. If that's not happening, don't get involved. It takes 2 people loving, appreciating each other and working hard on the relationship.\n\nShe sounds manipulative, cruel and happy for everyone to serve her (very entitled).\n\nI'm sorry. All the very best to you!",
            "It\u2019s so weird that she said she sees you as a friend. What does she think a husband is? The root word of boyfriend is FRIEND. You\u2019re supposed to know each other like the back of your hand. You\u2019re supposed to be just like room mates who help each other. The crazy libido and sex always ends and the honey moon phase always wears off. It is really sad she doesn\u2019t know how to appreciate someone caring for her and having her back because she will definitely miss it when you\u2019re gone.",
            "Keep your head up man. From reading your original post it seemed like you were willing to do everything possible to try and work on your marriage; unfortunately it does take two people to want to fix it. Use this time in your life to find peace within yourself and to make your life what you want it to be.",

            "Divorce is a rough road. Its up and down. The last 11 months have been some of the most hellish of my life.\n\nBut now that im almost through the tunnel (finalize next month with our settlement), its refreshing. I look back at so many unhappy moments and situations that i don't have to go back to anymore. Looking back at it, i thought I was happier in those moments than I really was\n\nHopefully you have a similar experience, because divorce is a fresh beginning- a chance to find somebody who is in love with you the way she wasnt. \n\nI highly recommend subscribing and visiting r/Divorce  - it helped me a lot",
            "From the first post:\n\n\u201cAfter we got engaged the intimacy started to die down and a couple months before the wedding my wife cut of all sexual acts stating she wanted to wait until we got married.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a reason this is considered a red\nflag, and the reason is that you end up marrying into a dead bedroom. Sounds like your wife had started to fall out of love with you, and the actual wedding accelerated that process.",
            "You are 26 and have so much life ahead, give it a few years which will fly bye and realize you are one of the lucky ones who did mot waste a minute more of your life. Next one will be better, trust me.",

            "Honestly you are going to find someone and realise how much was wrong with your previous relationship. Things that just became normal. I was with a guy for 7 years and I never felt unhappy necessarily but there wasnt that crazy in love connection I have with my partner now. But for now, rediscover who you are, have some fun and enjoy life for a bit.",
            "[deleted]",
            "So from what it sounds like, your wife has a serious issue with expectations in a marriage. \n\n\nJust for background, as I read both your posts about your wife, it reminded me so much of how I used to think of marriage, that my husband was going to make me happy. He tried, he really did, and after the first year of marriage, he came to the conclusion no matter what he did, he couldn't make me happy, only I could do that. So he gave me an ultimatum. Get into therapy to figure out how I can look to myself for happiness, and also, help treat my major depression. He's not one to give ultimatums, but after him working so hard and me just wanting more from our marriage, more from him, but not knowing what exactly I wanted, he realized I needed to figure that out. I did. \n\n\nI went to therapy, did all the work, and tried really hard to figure out how to not look to others for my happiness. I took assertive training classes which worked really well and taught me to stand up for myself, and basically grow up and mature emotionally. The ultimatum came 21 years ago, and me and hubs are still happily married, with reasonable expectations. \n\n\nIt sounds like your wife is depending on you to make her happy, and when she's not happy, she tells you to do things she thinks will finally make her fulfilled and happy, but when you do it, she's still just as unhappy. She continues to look to outside situations to make her feel better, but doesn't realize that no matter what you do, it will never be enough because the calls coming from inside the house. (Ha! Couldn't help it!) but seriously, she needs to look at herself to make her happy, not you.",
            "It's fine if you divorce as you are young and your relationship is probably beyond repair anyway. The most important thing though is that you learn from the experience and don't repeat the same mistakes the next time around. \n\nTo be really blunt: you are a classic doormat. Throughout the entire relationship with your wife, you never set reasonable rules and boundaries. She said she doesn't want sex - ok honey. She said she wants to uproot and move - ok honey. She said you need to do most of the house chores - ok honey. The thing is, you weren't making any decisions to agree with her. She knew that you had no spine to fight back and took full advantage of it, losing respect for you in the process.\n\nSo the most important thing is that before you get into another relationship, you need to learn how to assert yourself and actually live the way you want rather than conform to everything that your partner wants. Of course to an extent you can accommodate, but it has to go both ways and it should never be that one person does all the giving and the other all the taking. No healthy relationship can be built that way.",
            "To be honest reading your posts, I think the first good thing she has done for you thus far is force the divorce issue. It's hard to think about, when you are consumed by the struggling of making someone love and be attracted to you -- you're so wrapped up in pleasing them and courting the things you want to see in them (affection, arousal, love, respect, the person you thought you knew in the honeymoon phase, etc), you forget to do your own assessment and evaluation of your needs. \n\nI don't know if she was cheating on you, I don't want to make assumptions, but she had some reason for being checked out for several years. I think it sounds she really never valued all that you provided (as the bill-payer, house-cleaner, chore husband) because she had always had that from you. It doesn't sound like she sought to bring the same or similar improvements to your life -- what was she putting IN the \"pot\"? In what ways did she really try to actively figure out, how can I make this man feel happy and loved and valued as more than a friend, and then do that consistently. \n\nYou're 26, and you will take this self-knowledge with you, and when you are ready, you'll spark a much better relationship with someone who will be attracted to the person you are at your core, and seek to kindle and take care of that attraction. All you have to do is focus on yourself and figure out, who do I want to be and what do I want in a partner, and you have time to do that. And if you can, be grateful to your wife - not for the outcome, not for the pain, but for recognizing that she needed to let you free, so that you could find someone who can actually love you.",

This was not the woman for you and that's clear now, but one day you'll find your person and they'll find you. \n\nThe hard times won't end there because *any* relationship takes some work to go well. However, you know how to handle yourself when things are getting rough. You know the right steps to take to make things better, and you have the heart to do it. \n\nDon't be discouraged if you find that you're fighting or drifting in your new relationship, because it will happen sometimes.

It doesn\u2019t seem like the relationship ever really worked aside from some new relationship energy, which, of course, isn\u2019t sustainable. Also, your wife seems like a very unhappy person in general and she\u2019s going to have to do a lot of work on herself to find that happiness. You can\u2019t do it for her and she can\u2019t do it for you. I think you\u2019ll both be better than fine in the long run. Good luck to you!",

You can\u2019t make someone stay and commit who doesn\u2019t want to be there no matter how much you love them. Be very cautious of your ex circling back to you when their new fantasy life turns into real life. Always remember they didn\u2019t want you when there was something out there that they perceived as better and you don\u2019t ever have to be second choice for anyone.

What you learned from this will make you ready for your perfect partner.  You are already sure that you are a good partner so keep that confidence in yourself. \n\nAllow yourself the grief that will come from this split. If you acknowledge it and process it, it goes away pretty soon. It makes some people think that they want to get back together but that's because it can be confusing.  You will feel the loss of what you expected your life to be.  The frustration of having tried so damn hard and failing anyway. (It take two to work it out) The uncertainty of starting a new life on your own, and more.

I imagine you are better aware of what you need from a partner and what is required of you than before. It will hurt and there will be harder and easier days. Don't beat yourself up on the hard days.

You'll see your situation much more clearly. \n\n\nIf you let it sit as is, you'll think you are fucked up, unlovable, etc. You're only seeing the act she wanted you to see in this breakup. You are worth more than you feel or how this relationship attempts to portray you. \n\nDon't let this sham marriage ruin the next one. Don't go into the next relationship blind. And especially don't take her back because she'll just casually leave you again.",

            "Idk if you\u2019ll even read this.... but I\u2019ll share. I am 41 years old, and very happily married. I was married to my ex-Wife for 7 years, from the ages of 23-30. We married in Las Vegas, and lord we went on a million wonderful adventures together. We both had great careers, and life was good.  Fast forward to May of 2008, things are very different between my wife and I.  The year leading up to our demise was filled with her making statements about not loving me, and wanting out. It absolutely broke my heart for years to come. I cannot express the importance of putting yourself first. I remarried 2 years later, and it was a mistake, totally. I was so hurt I ended up marrying a woman with two almost teenage daughters. I didn\u2019t love her.... it was a short marriage, with the both of us leaving on good terms. So by 2011 I\u2019m single, and ready to stay that way. I was at the point your at right now. I took a few road trips alone, and began going to the movies and out to eat alone. It was nice to know I didn\u2019t need to be with someone to live my life. The years that followed were fantastic(single years 2011-2016). I can\u2019t say enough how important it is to master yourself and love yourself before committing to another. It seems cloudy right now, but I promise it clears up and your wiser, and more at peace. Good luck my friend.\n\nEdit: I was 32-37 in my single years.",
            "I didn\u2019t see your original post until now but this is for the best. You\u2019re still very young. You sound like a great catch. Don\u2019t change. Just keep your standard for who you date very high.\n\nWhen you said she wasn\u2019t happy with your level of chores around the house, I had a feeling she taught you to do everything because of the comment your parents made about her being lazy.\n\nIt sounds like you gave 110% and she gave 50%.\n\nAnd you\u2019re exactly right, life is to short to waste time on someone who only loves you 50%.",
            "Wow, thank you so much for commenting. I know I need to be single and be comfortable with myself. It\u2019s something I struggle with because I\u2019ve always had someone. So the desire to have someone and not be lonely is there, but I just have to push past it and be alone. Master that and then I can truly be happy. So thank you again.m for commenting. Glad to see you are happy now.",
            "I have a feeling this is going to be the best thing that ever happened to you and the worst thing that ever happened to her. Unfortunately, some of our mistakes are only clear in hindsight. You sound like a caring partner who put in the work to make it work; she was unwilling. You both are very young, and this will be on your side as you navigate your way through this emotional time. Someone is going to appreciate you and you\u2019re going to make a great husband ... for someone who is also looking to put in the work. Relationships are a lot of hard work, and one person cannot do all the heavy lifting. You can only try so much and be met with so much rejection before you have to accept that it is what it is and you\u2019ve got to cut your losses. I\u2019ve been there.  It will get better, but it\u2019s pretty painful at first.\n\nI wish you the very best. She might change her mind at the last second because she\u2019s scared; don\u2019t give in, OP. You deserve to be someone\u2019s first choice and you will be.",
            "Good for you for snapping yourself out of it, but also don't worry about being sad. It's ok to feel bad, and to not expect it to get better right away, especially if you are dedicated to making improvements. Just do be patient with yourself. There are better and worse days ahead, but each dip gets shallower, and each peak gets a bit higher. A therapist once told me that pain is like carving something into a tree. The pain itself never vanishes, but proportionally to the size of the tree, it gets smaller as time goes on and the tree grows.",
            "Have you spoke to her about things you can improve? Do you help with house work? Is your sexual life all about you and she just gets done what you want or do you actually listen and figure out what she really likes? Do you do things she likes or ask what she wants to do? What are her passion, her hobbies? Can you be a part of some of them? It's not a one day decision that she doesnt love you. And I'm not saying it's a one way street either, but do you know what her love language is? Maybe you're doing the love language you think is right for her vs what she really needs. Look up love languages and talk to her about them.",

            "Mate reading this crushed my heart. It really fucking sucks to have found Love so soon, only to lose it like that. I read your other post. You tried so hard, gave it your all. And you would have given even more if it meant getting back the person your wife once was. I recently, and still am, experiencing something similar to what you're going through. Even though we're about 7 years younger, my ex and I, who were together for much less time than you and your wife, we went through what you've gone through, in much less time. She lost her feelings for me. Admitting to me that I pushed her away by overwhelming her with my love. These are something's that Ive come to know. They apply to my situation, so maybe they apply to yours.  I was BAFFLED when my ex broke up with me. I put in so much effort, bought her surprise gifts and made time just for her and did my research into the things she was into so we could have common interests! Why would she leave me if I put in so much effort to be the best boyfriend I could be? A good friend of mine helped me realize that it likely wasn't me. My ex has a history with mental illnesses that she refused to address. And that those mental illnesses made her think she isn't deserving of someone that loves her. That she isn't deserving of being loved. She told me she HATES therapists, and would never return to therapy after a single session she had. With that having been said, she wasn't willing to change herself to be a better partner, not just for herself, but for you. She wasn't willing to put in any effort into the relationship. It wasn't my fault I had so much Love to give, she wasn't willing to accept it. In your relationship, your wife may not be willing to accept your Love. Why? I have no idea. In my case, mental illness is the probable cause, but since every case is different, I can't say for certain what your case is. Perhaps since you both married so young, she may have seen her marriage as a roadblock in her career path. And she wasn't honest with herself and what she wanted, so she may have resented herself for not making a change. Just know that is 10000000% NOT your fault. And I'm inclined to say it isn't her fault either. Of course it sucks Major Ass, but it would be wrong to guilt trip her into a relationship. She wasn't willing to put effort into rekindling your relationship. My ex was the same way. Even though I never changed who I was, and I only ever tried harder to make her happy, she still denied me. Just like you only ever tried harder to be a better partner, your ex just wasn't willing to accept it. The facts that you read books and were willing to go to counseling with and for her shows that you had much motivation, and Love to give to her. The fact that she would get angry when you merely brought up the topic of rebuilding your relationship points to a larger problem she may not be sharing with you. Perhaps I am wrong, but I speak from my experience. My ex shared less and less of her life with me as she lost her Love for me. I'm sorry for what you're going through Brother. You tried so hard. But it wouldn't have mattered if you tried harder. Ultimately the problem lies within her, and as long as she refused couples counseling and reading books to even try and rebuild your relationship, nothing will change. Relationships are like chains. Chains are only as strong as their weakest link. Like Chains, a Relationship will begin to crumble if one chain looses it's strength. If one partner decides to stop putting in effort to heal the relationship, no one can prevent it's collapse but the partner that gave up. Nobody can change her mind but herself, and until then, all other attempts will likely end in disappointment. Maybe if you did something of grand proportions, she would fall in love with the sight, but a relationship is about loving someone at their worst, as much as you love them at their best. If she doesn't love you right now, and you love her as much as you do, you will only experience pain in your attempts to regain her. I pray for the best for you brother, we have a long road in front of us. The good thing is that we aren't the first, or only people on this path. As bleak as things may seem, believe me, they get better. I am now much better than when I was when my ex broke up with me. I lost my appetite for about a or two week, and even developed an illness due to the stress she put me through that lasted two weeks and may have even left me scarred! And although I know it is wrong to put blame on others, it can bring me comfort to know that our relationship failed because of something lacking on her end. What matters, is that I don't harbor negative feelings for her. Rather, my goal is to come to a point of apathy. I wish to care for her as I would any passing stranger on the street. I'll use what I can to make me feel better now, as long as I know that it won't hurt anyone, and won't lead to me holding a grudge against her. I hope you found some use of my comment if you got this far bro, I pray things will go well for you and your wife.",
            "Good on you, she drained you emotionally and psychologically. You many not realise it now, but she wasn\u2019t worth it- all she did was complain about your relationship and when you both agreed to try and fix things she completely refused to. She treated you more like a manservant and not a husband to love and to be intimate with. Someone out there is going to be perfect for you; and she wasn\u2019t it. Hope you are well :)",
            "I spent 15 years with a woman, two children, trying to figure out if we loved each other, or hated each other.  Finally decided it was both.  We came back from a week long vacation, and she packed up in the middle of the night.  Moved in with her tennis instructor.  Her tennis instructor??? How fucking clich\u00e9d is that?\n\nIn the end, it was for the best.  I took the kids.  Five years later, I\u2019m remarried.  Happy as fuck. The kids are great.  The divorce was the best thing that could have happened.\n\nShe got pregnant with the tennis instructor.  He\u2019s pushing 40, can\u2019t make a living giving lessons, so she\u2019s supporting him and the kid.  He\u2019s thinking about going back to college and wants her to pay for it, but refuses to marry her.  She\u2019s miserable.  Karma.\n\nLong story short, better to find out about it when you are only 26 and haven\u2019t sunk more wasted years into it.  Wishing you the best.  The next chapter will be better.\n\nP.S. A couple of suggestions.  Don\u2019t go looking for love.  Avoid the apps and websites.  My grandmother once said, \u201cYou will never find love.  Love, when you are ready, will find you.\u201d  Give yourself time to heal.  Find love inside yourself.  When you have love to share, then love will find you.  I knew my wife for years as a friend.  Never thought of her romantically, then one day, BAM!",
            "After reading the original post, I am actually glad for you that she chose divorce - at least both of you will feel happier in the long run and find the happiness that you both deserve. Take some time off to recover from this and think through what you want for your next relationship (nobody is going to rush you to get over it). :)\n\nOh and most importantly, when you become a better person than before etc etc, PLEASE DO NOT ACCEPT HER if she ever comes back to you with all that \"I realised I am still in love with you, can we get back together\" nonsense. You saw how much effort she was willing to put in during this marriage, and you know how much effort you put in to salvage the relationship. A leopard never changes its spots, so don't get yourself into that same trouble again. You deserve better!\n\nStay strong!",

            "Reading your original post, the only thing that I can say is that the marriage was over before it even began.\n\n> My wife and I met close to 6 years ago. Crazy over each other and really  intimate. After we got engaged the intimacy started to die down and a  couple months before the wedding my wife cut of all sexual acts stating  she wanted to wait until we got married. \n\nThis indicates that she had already checked out of the relationship months before the marriage, and just wanted to get the marriage thing done. After all, why would she expect things to be different after the marriage in regards to her libido? She wouldn't, but since you probably still wanted to do it with her, it was a carrot to be dangled in front of you to get to where she wanted to be.",
            "the fact that she ended intercourse and said wait after we are married seems manipulative plus a person sex drive does not go to zero overnight drop in intimacy is allways a red flag and need to be addressed ,you never said what feeling rejected over the years felt for you i wanna know ,plus relationships are a partnership one party doing all the work is never good sign ending it here is a blessing ,i hope you see this as a lesson that i also learned ,never take upon your self to make  relationship work it has to come from both sides ,do not keep score or anything as long as both of you are making an effort ,intimacy makes relationship stronger when it drops you should make the effort to work on it right away even therapy if you need to bcz it is the ultimate bond lovers have .",

            "Sorry to read about your dad. I didn\u2018t see your original post when you posted it, but I\u2018m glad to read you\u2018re doing well. My dad committed suicide my last semester of college, about 2.5 months before I graduated. I took a week off from school, but afterwards concentrated on school (as best as I could). I ended up passing with all A\u2018s and B\u2018s. It\u2018s an incredibly difficult time as you\u2018re still processing everything while trying to maintain the life/work balance. It took me a good 4-5 years to really be \u201cokay\u201d with it all, and even after 10 years I still struggle from time to time. Take time to truly grieve. It\u2019s important. Either way, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be incredibly proud of you and what you\u2019ve accomplished.",

The stupid (I thought!) saying that sound like platitudes but are really the clues to how to live a good life as a decent human being. I wish you the same. It's very comforting. And you're never too old to miss your mom or dad.\n\nAs my parents told me all the time (to intense rolling of my eyes), \"A job worth doing is worth doing well,\" and, \"No one benefits from your education but you.\" Sounds like you've got those two down pat! I think your dad would be very proud of you.\n\nGood luck to you and in your future studies!",

But she's goes to mutiple therapies and keeps trying her best. It's been a while now and she's not okay but she's doing her best. She's crying less and also wanted to give up on her Animal vet tech job. I told her that her dad wouldnt want that and she should keep at it because that's what he would want. He wouldnt want her to fall apart.\n\nI'm very happy to hear you stuck through your class. Make sure you see someone and talk to them about your issue. Like a psychiatrist or something. I'm not going to say life will be 100% okay but you can still find happiness moving forward.",

I do remember that it took me almost a year to be able to concenrate on reading anything more than a magazine.  So I'm impressed that you were able to keep up your grades.  That's a real accomplishment.  I'm sure your dad would be really proud of you.\n\nI'm sorry for him that his pain was greater than the desire to keep plugging along.

My father recovered, her mother did not. She stayed in that semester of her masters and didn\u2019t get the best grades of her life (mainly Cs) but built a FANTASTIC career, with all of the compassion and strength and intelligence she learned from her mother.\n\nI know no words can make this better, but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that your father would be so, so proud - and that you are building a life on the lessons you learned from him.",

            "Good for you. I'd only suggest that when school is done with, you take some time to properly explore your grief and let it out. You don't want to keep it bottled up and then have it affect you later on.\n\nBest wishes good buddy",
            "I am so proud of you. \nMy mom took her own life when I was 12 and it never gets easier and I realized pretty young that you have two choices in life when shit hits the fan to let it destroy you or let it motivate you. \nHang in there and keep kicking life's ass.",

Although obviously being upset I remember also being confused as to why this happened and why my dad decided that he preferred to not be in my life anymore. I don't believe it gets easier but I do believe you slowly learn to get used to him not being around anymore. It sucks.",

Be kind and gentle to yourself. \n\nInternet hugs from a far flung internet stranger. I wish you health, healing and success.",
            "I didnt see your initial post but my heart breaks for you. My dad committed suicide when I was younger so I can empathize with some of what you are feeling. There is no right way to grieve so just know whatever way you feel right now is how you should be feeling. I know people say that there are five stages that you work through in grief, and yes I did experience them all, but you don't have to go through them one by one. There is no set time for each so called stage in my opinion. If you yo-yo back and forth then that's what you need to do, If you spend a week or years being angry (which may be what I did) then that's what you need to do. Processing sonething like this takes time, especially in these first few months and even in the years that follow. Don't be ashamed if you need to cry in the bathroom, take a mental health day, or buy some really cheap vases at the thrift store and smash them. Make sure you surround yourself with people who love you and will be there for you. A good support system is the best thing right now. People who will just be there for you, to listen to you and how you are feeling as time goes on. I highly suggest counseling-it doesn't have to be right now but maybe down the line. \nAlso take the wins when you can get them. Keep yourself busy and try to do things you enjoy. You are doing great!\nIf you need someone to talk to message me.",
            "I\u2019m really sorry man. My (19) dad (55) committed suicide 2.5 months ago. I dropped everything. Quit my job stopped going to school etc etc. Let me tell you though don\u2019t do it. It has hurt me so badly these last couple weeks both financially and stress wise. Now if you need to I\u2019d contact your administrators and let them know your situation. Maybe they\u2019ll allow you to push your classes out a bit so you have time to grieve. I\u2019m truly sorry man but don\u2019t make any rash decisions right now. It might hurt you more.",

Here's to more success and to always remembering those we lost <3",
            "Congrats! And I'm sorry for your loss. I lost my mom while I was still in school, and also went right back and threw myself into it and work to keep busy. I will heed some caution, though. While not everyone is the same and deals with their grief differently, make sure you are not avoiding it with school/work and allow yourself some time to sit and process it. Speaking from experience, i completely neglected to do that, and 10 years later I'm learning how much that effected me and my relationships.",

Since his suicide, it become ingrained in me as an option for relief from my pains and problems. Funny thing is, it's sort of a fleeting thought that immediately fades away, but its always nagging.... stub my toe? Kill myself..... break up with my boyfriend? Kill myself.... burnt the toast?  Kill myself..... only quick passing thoughts to be immediately put aside... but always popping up in my mind... with counseling, and some anti depressants on occasion, I grew to understand those ingrained, fleeting thoughts as a basic learned response, not let them overwhelm or rule me.\nI had many happy years between then and now, and you will to.

            "Saw this and wanted to leave a comment. 3 years ago my mom committed suicide when my last year of high school started. For context, I lived alone with her as we emigrated to a foreign country, so I was super lost after it happened. University applications were opening up and I could barely concentrate to study. My school offered me to just not come to school, and that they will still send unis the same marks that I had before without the need to complete more assessments. I actually turned it down and kept on going to school, and that was imo the best decision I could've made for my mental recovery. Keep yourself busy, keep yourself focused on your goals, there's no better way to move on than that imo. Your dad will want to see you living strong for him too. It's been 3 years now and I can confidently say I am now a much, much happier person than I was before it all happened. It may seem all so dark and uncertain but trust me, it will be all good again if you just keep fighting for it.",

Thankfully all have been understanding, but I hear so many horror stories of teachers that just dismiss their students troubles like nothing.\n\nCongrats dude! I'm so happy for you.

I was set to attend school at Valdosta State University in the Fall of 2009 and it was about three hours away from my home, never been so far away in my life for an extended period of time up until that point. \n\nI unfortunately did not have as good of a turn around as you did - I ended up failing all of my classes, except for one I got a C in somehow. I left Valdosta a week before finals and never looked back. I went to two other small community colleges before I graduated from Georgia State two years ago cum laude. I\u2019ve never spoken to a counselor, but I continue to suffer with a lot of guilt as I feel responsible for my dad committing suicide (LSS I turned 18, became a rebel, made my relationship with him go sour, kicked out, etc.). It\u2019ll be ten years next month he passed away and it\u2019s still super hard for me at holidays and my birthday and just every day life but it gets better. \n\nI\u2019m so happy to hear you are doing well and I only hope you continue to flourish. <3",

I was in week 3 of the school term and was so emotionally exhausted, stressed, grief stricken and fatigued. I ended up having a long conversation with the dean who did the work of communicating to all of my professors. All of my professors ended up transitioning a lot of my work to online work, and I actually made the deans list that term. I definitely credit my school and professors for working extremely hard to keep me in school. I would not have graduated if they didn't go above and beyond to help me through it.\n\nPlease.\n\nTake your time. Be kind to yourself.

I didn\u2019t see your original post but the update resonated with me, and I just felt the need to let you know how amazing you are to be able to stay in school, and keep your grades up so close to graduating. I too had a dad who passed away, even thought my story is no where as near similar to yours. To keep it short, I grew up and my mom grew up physically abused by him, but I forgive him for various reasons and the fact that he was unstable and extremely sick. An amazing dad when stable. Anyways he died from a drug overdose in 2014, and my mom tells me it wasn\u2019t suicide but it\u2019s so hard for me to believe. No more about that, I just think it\u2019s so great how well you\u2019re handling this, at least from what I can read on here. It\u2019s been 5 years since my dad\u2019s death, and I start college the year after (I\u2019m starting my senior year of highschool next year). I\u2019ve already attended my local juco college for a semester, and dropped out due to stress and some other issues. Some stemming from things about my dad. Anywho the fact that just a month or so after this happened with your father and you accomplishing this is outstanding and makes me want to work even harder to better myself mentally. I couldn\u2019t even finish my associates due to stress and anxiety, let alone if my dad\u2019s passing had been even more recent. So sorry for this being long, i\u2019ve never posted or commenting before but Idk something about your story just made me feel like I needed to let you know how awesome you are and are doing. <3\n\nedit: grammar and sorry if the juco thing is confusing, I was doing a middle college program in highschool to graduate with an associates and my diploma.",

It feels great to be comforted and cheered on by you all. Thank you **so much**.\n\nSo, husband cheated. He has been since \"maybe two weeks before last Christmas\", according to him.\n\nI was very calm when confronting him and took the advice many of you gave me by telling him that he needs to explain to me who Roxy is and why she is his \"best friend\" on Snapchat. His face gave him away immediately but he still tried to lie to me at first. \n\nHe said that she works with his friend and they met when his friend invited her out to lunch with the two of them. At first, he claimed he only met her about two months ago. He said that they're \"best friends\" because he doesn't receive many snapchats from others and she is extremely active on the app. He said she just sends randoms and is really into fitness, so she sends a lot of \"inspirational\" snaps on being healthy and living a better life. He said that every once in a while, he'll send her something back, like a picture of a cheeseburger or something just to tease her about her level of health-consciousness.\n\nFirst, I asked why he didn't just tell me about her. He said he didn't even think about it because she's just an acquaintance, not even a friend. Then I asked if he'd ever received anything even remotely inappropriate from her.\n\nHe answered with, \"Not on purpose\". I'm assuming he went with that because he knew I opened that snapchat and he probably knew it was a bad one.\n\nI asked what \"Not on purpose\" means. He got very defensive. Started raising his voice and saying he doesn't need to explain what that means, that sometimes people accidentally send the wrong snapchats to the wrong people. Then he had the nerve to say something along the lines of, \"I feel like I'm on trial here. People warned me that you'd get crazy when you're pregnant but I never thought it'd be this bad.\"\n\nNow. As some of you mentioned in my last post, it seems amazing that I'm able to keep such a level-head. That is because I was raised by a mother who always told me that you *never* accomplish anything with anger. That you can be emotional, passionate, upset, etc. without ever raising your voice. Messages received quietly and concisely are just as loud and clear as messages received through yelling and screaming. That is how I have lived my life for 26 years, with the exception of just a few blow ups (I am human).\n\nThis moment was an exception. I didn't exactly yell and scream, but I became furious. For him to try to blame this on me being pregnant? How unoriginal and offensive. Long story short, he said he'd never seen me this crazy and I told him that I'd never seen a picture of another girl's pussy on my husband's snapchat before. He came back with that I shouldn't have looked at his snapchat. I came back with that it was an accident but even if it hadn't been, there shouldn't be any reason he's receiving snapchats like that for me to see- accidentally or not- in the first place. I told him that I may be pregnant but I'm also an intelligent person and I am his *wife*, so I knew he was lying and I deserved to know the truth. I asked if I could see his text messages to see if he's been texting Roxy. He said sure. No messages. Then I asked to see his Facebook messages. He looked like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He told me no. I asked why.\n\nHe finally broke and started to cry. Told me he couldn't let me see the messages because they would hurt me. Because they were inappropriate. \n\nThen it all came out. They screwed in the backseat of her car the **first** night they met.\n\nThis is already long so I'll spare you all the details. But it's been an ongoing affair for months. No, they did not always use protection. Although I was recently screened for STIs, I'll be getting checked again in light of this information.\n\nMy uncle already assured me that if he was unfaithful, we would cream him in court. Really the only thing I'm willing to fight him tooth & nail for is our home; I put a lot of effort and money into making this home my dream space. I won't be seeking spousal support but I will seek child support. \n\nI'm obviously heartbroken and told him to go stay in a hotel or with Roxy for all I cared (I confronted him last night). My mom & sister stayed with me last night and let me sob all over them for hours. Right now I'm sort of numb but I'm also thinking very clearly. I know what my next 10 moves are and I feel supported and secure in my decision to leave him and keep my baby.\n\nA few things I just wanted to clarify: My husband is not a lawyer; his good friend is. There was some concern for my success in court if my husband is a lawyer. His friend is in environmental law so, while I'm sure he can provide some advice, he will not be my husband's divorce lawyer.\n\nThere were suggestions of me terminating my pregnancy. I fully support the right to choose and I would probably terminate the pregnancy if I was in a different financial position and lacked a support system. However, I work as a marketing manager for a large company. Not only does this allow me the privilege of working from home about 50% of the time, but it also grants me financial independence. I do not rely on my husband for money and I really never have. He works in tech so, while he makes a good salary, I will have no need for spousal support. I have a phenomenal support system; this baby will be loved so dearly by so many. Yes, I will have to deal with my husband for the rest of my life if I have this child and it will make future relationships for me more difficult, but it is worth it. I've wanted this baby since day one and I am her mother, which means that I am strong enough to raise her alone because I *have* to be strong enough.\n\nHere's to hoping for a speedy divorce. I'm ready to be done with this marriage. Which is crazy because just a few days ago I thought my life was as close to perfect as you could get.\n\n**tl;dr** Husband admitted to an affair. I will be proceeding with a divorce and will keep our baby. I'm numb but calm and feeling good about my decisions and how I handled the situation. I know there is a long road ahead of me and this will all probably *really* hit me soon. When it does, I'll mourn and grieve the end of what I had thought was a happy union. Right now I'm in self-preservation mode and much more focused on how to come out of this in the best position possible. Thank you so much for all the advice and support, Reddit!\n\n**Edit:** Formatting\n\n**UPDATE:** I know it has been only a short time since I posted this update but I need to tell you all how amazing all of you are. Wow, this much support is just... wow. I wish I could reply to all of your comments and messages but because of the volume, I'm just going to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to each and every one of you who read my posts, who commented, thought of me, wished my baby & me the best, messaged me, and anything else. I am currently at my parent's condo, sitting outside at their pool, sunbathing my little baby bump and reading each and every one of your amazing and empowering comments. I just want you all to have that image; that **you** have made me happy and content in a time when I am short on both. This is proof that love does exist, even if it doesn't within my, now over, relationship. And that is a powerful thing. \n\nLove to you all.\n\n\n**Me again:** I was going to post more details on what happened during the confrontation with my husband, etc., but then I decided against it. I should keep some details private; it's likely my husband has seen this post. \n\nI will leave you with this:\n\nMy dad and I were up late talking last night and, as usual, he had the perfect thing to say to me. He told me that weak people are afraid of strong people. He told me to keep on terrifying the weak ones. That way, the only people who won't fear you are the bravest, strongest of people and those are the people who are worthy of you.\n\nThen he said my husband is a spineless turd who couldn't kick it with the strongest woman in the world.\n\nJust thought I'd leave you with that and encourage everyone to \"be terrifying\" by being strong and not standing for nonsense.\n\nThis is the last I will post on the matter. I have a lot ahead of me with everything and will probably go quiet on Reddit for a while. Time to get ready for court and to \"be terrifying\". :)\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you again. Love to all of you and best wishes.\n\nLove,\n\n-T ",

            "Huge piece of advice for you, DO NOT DATE ANYBODY UNTIL AFTER THE DIVORCE! Might not have even crossed your mind, might be a year before the devorce is finalized, but do not date! Doing so can instantly destroy any infidelity case you have and destroy you in court. This happened to my dad; mom cheated on him, they separated for over a year, he dated like a month before the final divorce hearing, she claimed he was always cheating with his new girlfriend so that is why she cheated. Existing relationship is hard to disprove, especially when they did know each other at the time. They split things 50/50 instead of her getting basically nothing.",

            "> A few things I just wanted to clarify: My husband is not a lawyer; his good friend is. There was some concern for my success in court if my husband is a lawyer. His friend is in environmental law so, while I'm sure he can provide some advice, he will not be my husband's divorce lawyer.\n\nI am a lawyer and TBH people often overestimate the effect a good lawyer can have. A bad one can certainly cause you all sorts of problems, but in most family law cases these days things mostly go by formulas and prior practice. \n\nFind yourself a good lawyer of course, as you want good work, but don't let them promise you results unless they can point to previous cases where a person got that result. \n\nI don't work in family law directly, but I am in a close field and I have had many people tell me all the bullshit promises their divorce attorneys made about them getting full custody or tons of money when the facts didn't support it. \n\nIn my experience the best lawyers are the ones who know how to ask you the right questions to figure out what you want, then work with opposing counsel, or fight in court to make that happen. But that is often a parenting plan with shared custody, or a reasonable split of the assets. It's things like not having his new partner around the kids, or making sure that you are in charge of decisions you care about, e.g. religion, schooling, health care. Lots of attorneys will say they will fight for whatever you want, but the really good ones will tell you the truth about your likelihood of success. \n\nOne more thing, I don't know what state you are in, but the first thing I would look into is whether your state is a no-fault state or not. If it is then the affair will likely not have as much impact as you might like. \n",

Fortunately with a lot of hard work and therapy, we worked it out and made our marriage even stronger than it was in the best days, pre-affair. So I usually lean towards encouraging people to fight for their marriage, especially when a child is involved. \n\nI can offer that your husband is very likely in what is called an affair fog, where he's basically been riding high and addicted to the massive amounts of dopamine that comes with being involved in an affair. If he could get enough distance and focus on saving his marriage, it's likely he'd wake up and genuinely realize what an idiot he's been. \n\nThat said, most affairs are usually gradual and almost sneak up on people...that he had sex with her the same day they met is pretty fucking bad. Especially that he continued it while his unsuspecting wife was carrying a child he helped create. Sounds like your mind is made up anyway, but I just wanted to share what insight I have from having battled back from affairs in my own marriage. \n\nYou're probably dealing with some serious emotional shock right now, though you sound incredibly resolved and clear-headed. But please take care of yourself, get plenty of rest, and try to not stay idle too long and let yourself gnaw away at it. Grief is a like a big city skyline with drops and peaks that slowly levels out with time.",
            "I will say that if you and your husband didn't fight as a couple you probably won't fight much as a divorced couple.  You may be angry about the affair for a while but honestly when divorced couples have problems it's because they had problems as a couple.  The basic dynamic and chemistry between you won't change, just your status.  This may help going forward esp. With the child.",

I now have GAD and borderline personality disorder and my sister has type 1 bipolar. Part of that was genes of course, but I know the stress brought it out. Their divorce was terrible, and when I say terrible, I mean by my father was making up insane lies about my mom committing crimes against him to get her in prison. \n\nI'm glad to hear you're keeping your daughter. Nothing is worth giving her up. My mom had me at 17 and I know she wouldn't change it for the world. She's now very ill with cancer and needs me to care for her too. You never know what life will give you but you just have to roll with the punches. Keep going, I wish you all the best. * *hugs* *",

I ask because (although every situation is different) I've been married for 19 years and I'm not 100% sure I'd divorce my husband if he cheated, not that I ever believe he would.

You are free to fly away from him!\n\nI hate hate hate how life's most stressful moments tend to happen during a pregnancy. Keep yourself calm.

The day after his parents' 50th anniversary party, I told him I wanted a divorce. I just couldn't see myself living like that for 50 years.\n\nI moved from the suburbs to the city with a friend. I rekindled some old friendships from high school and made a bunch of new friends who I am so thankful for. He kept the dog, I took the cats.\n\n**I thought my life was ending but it was just beginning.**\n\nI told my (very religious) family and they were all understanding and supportive. I've maintained friendships with a good number of our mutual friends, friendships I was worried about losing.\n\nI'm working on my masters degree and volunteering and experiencing life and love and art and beauty like I never thought was possible.\n\nI met a guy at a friend's punk rock show and we hit it off, but we are taking things very slowly. He is wonderful and so kind to me.\n\n**If you are in an abusive relationship, please don't be afraid to leave.**\n\nIt gets so much better. I still miss him from time to time. I feel guilty about getting divorced, guilty for wasting my parents money on a failed marriage. I miss his parents. I miss my dog.\n\nBut I am SO MUCH happier. My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.\n\nThank you so much to everyone who offered advice and sympathized and even had harsh words for me deciding to stay.\n\ntl;dr: Left my abusive husband. Life is much better.\n\nEDIT: for those saying it didn\u2019t sound that bad or abusive, you should know it got worse. It did escalate to physical abuse, us sleeping separately/no intimacy for a year. \n\nIf you think you are too old or too much trouble or have too much baggage or are too much anything, please believe that it is possible to find love again.

            ">My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.\n\nYes! I remember reading once that what human beings are scared of most is uncertainty. So in a way, staying with your abusive husband -- while awful and full of emotional abuse -- was the safe option because you *knew* what you were in for. Leaving him was an act of bravery and I hope your future is full of warmth and love.",

            "Good for you OP and thank you for the update. Sometimes it is so hard to leave unbalanced situations like that because at least you feel like you \"know\" your situation, and that can feel better than the unknown. \n\nI know how horribly he'll react to this so I can prepare for it.\n\nI know to walk on eggshells so I am ready for it.\n\nYou do your best to act as your partners \"handler\", like some kind of lion tamer. But relationships should not be like that.\n\nI am happy for you!",
            "Congratulations!  I'm so so very happy for you for changing how your story ends, please keep telling others so more people can be inspired to leave abusive relationships like you have! It must have taken  so much courage to take that leap , but so worth it!  And I totally understand where you came from and where you're going, my child's father would ask me such deprecating questions too, he broke me till one afternoon i was so low i hurt myself without thought, believing I deserved to be punished because I struggled to make him happy, but the moment I felt the pain I realized i was hurting myself for someone who obviously doesn't love me , when i should be healing myself for  my child's life.  I eventually left him a few months later, and my life soared after that! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n 7 years later I now have a happy home to myself and my little one with our cat, I spend my days free to do what I want with out walking on eggshells, my skin itself has cleared up because im not drinking as much, and my stress levels are down one million percent, Ive created hundreds of pieces of happy art and best of all, I met an amazing man who takes care of me and respects me who is everything I ever wanted!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIT GETS SO MUCH BETTER!!!",
            "As someone who left an abusive relationship as well, I agree with much of this. Being uncertain if your future is so much better than being unhappy. I think I was so afraid of the uncertainty (of ending up alone, of losing people,  etc) that I didn't even see how freeing uncertainty is. If things are uncertain,  it means you can choose so many directions,  and there are so many possibilities. \n\nUncertainty feels like freedom once you leave a controlling and abusive situation. I never realized that when I was still in it.",

And all the good and all the love that is heading your way! You Are Enough!!! xoxo",

Reading your original post, I am in a similar situation (constantly walking on egg shells because my SO is somehow always going through a stressful time - both of our lives are stressful, but somehow feels like he can say whatever and talk however he wants to me).

Seriously though, it's the most amazing thing when you have someone treat you with respect and genuine caring for the first time, and then realize you deserved that all along.  I left my abusive ex last year and am now with the man I wholeheartedly believe is my soulmate (never believed in those before him).  When I start to feel guilty or like something was wasted because of that relationship, I just remember it's behind me and it got me to *here*, and there's absolutely nowhere else I'd rather be.

You're a badass and a strong person and you deserve all the good things.\n\nAnd re: your edit-- It didn't need to have escalated for you to still be 100% justified in leaving (but I'm so sorry it did). No one should treat their partner the way he treated you. Everyone deserves to be safe, respected, and loved in their relationships.\n\nPlease enjoy your newfound independence and best of luck in future endeavours, romantic or otherwise.",
            "I\u2019m so happy you left and your life is amazing! This always makes my heart burst with happiness. I was in a 9 year abusive relationship, and the fear, isolation, and just uncertainty is what kept me there for so long. I just couldn\u2019t take it. I wanted to kill him, then myself, I so was miserable and desperate. Thankfully, I had amazing friends who stuck by my side all those years no matter what my ex said, always filling me with love, letting me know I always had a bed at there house for as long as I needed it. When I finally left the big beautiful house, with all the expensive toys in the barn, with  just my couple bags of clothes and my pillow, my world as I knew it burning down around me... I had never felt so relieved and happy!! I could actually breath again!! And I\u2019m happy to say I never shed a tear after I left (about him). I lived with my best friend for 2 months, then got my very first apartment by myself. I slowly started over, and life just kept getting better. Two years after I left, I met my soulmate. We\u2019ve been married now for almost 3 years, together for 6, and I found a level of happiness and peace of mind that I had never dreamed ever existed. Reprogramming everything my ex did to me took time, and I\u2019m still working on it everyday. But I feel truly strong, beautiful, and loved today.",

All of them found they strength to leave and better their lives. My sister left with 2 kids while pregnant with a 3rd and it's been financially hard but the 4 of them are all happier and healthier.

I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through what you did but I\u2019m so so happy that you\u2019re in a better place now! You Deserve happiness and I sincerely hope you stay happy!!",
            "This will probably get buried but I have to put in my two cents. I am so happy for you!!! Life is way too short to stay in an unhappy marriage.\nI left my emotionally abusive husband after a 6 year relationship and married for just under 2. It was hard. My very religious family all turned against me and he turned my 13 year old daughter against me in the process. I\u2019ve been fighting for months to get her back. But.. I\u2019m happier than I\u2019ve been in a long LONG time! I have an amazing boyfriend who\u2019s loving and supportive and has held me up through this. Things do get better and it\u2019s not always easy to follow your heart but it\u2019s so worth it. Congrats!!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
            "I am so happy to hear this and that you got out of that situation. The future is yours for the taking!",
            "I\u2019m just upvoting your entire post, this is such a honest and critical post that I think so many people need to see.\n\nI\u2019m so proud of you, and I\u2019m ecstatic that you\u2019ve seen the other side and how you\u2019re living your best life.\n\nTake care and stay well xx",
            ">He kept the dog, I took the cats.\n\nThis was unexpectedly heartbreaking. I hope the animals don't miss each other too much. But you did the right thing! Have a great life ahead and please cuddle the cats for me :)",
            "Oh I know this feeling so well. I'm so happy for you! Even though it's hard and uncertain, even though there are things you might miss, you did the right thing. It **will** get better.\n\nWhen I left my ex (also abusive) it was terrifying, but I suddenly felt so free. I would walk down the street with a huge smile on my face because I knew he wouldn't be waiting at the end to tear me down. I'm remarried now and the difference is night and day, I can't even imagine being back where I was before. All the best to you, I hope you have a shining future!",
            "I teared up reading this. Having worked with domestic violence victims, I've seen how hard it can be to change your entire life. You should be extremely proud of yourself. Very happy for you.",
            "First of all as a comment to your original post, I understand his outburst but it definitely was not deserved. If he\u2019s never communicated to you how he would want to handle a situation like that, that\u2019s not your fault. Anyone in your position would have assumed someone would want to know that kind of news as soon as possible, and I don\u2019t think you could\u2019ve expected him to react the way that he did. You have empathy *because* you told him, knowing he may want to hear that from you vs. finding out on Facebook. The fact that he reacted in such a volatile way says more about who he is as a person than it does you. Thank god you didn\u2019t have kids with him because he\u2019d screw them up way more than it appears you would have. Kudos to you for leaving him - he\u2019s not worth the toilet paper you wipe your ass with, and I hope he comes to that realization when he\u2019s alienated everyone around him.\n\nAs a child of someone whose father behaves exactly like your ex, it fucks you up mentally in ways you didn\u2019t expect and lasts well beyond childhood. When all you hear from someone is criticism and negativity (no matter who it\u2019s directed at), you start to assume everyone behaves that way and that the reason is you. It\u2019s even worse when you witness it as a kid between parents - my father has been verbally/emotionally abusive my entire life, towards everyone but especially my mother and me. Spent the better part of 25 years chasing after his affection and approval with not much to show for it. I can\u2019t begin to explain the kind of choices I\u2019ve made romantically because I craved the male attention from them that my dad couldn\u2019t bother to give me. The worst part was that in one way or another they almost emulated him. I\u2019ve since cut my father out of the majority of my life and for the first time in my life I\u2019ve taken a step back from dating to focus on bettering myself as a person and understanding what I\u2019ll tolerate and what I deserve. It\u2019s taken a very long time to come to that understanding and I know I\u2019m far from the end of the road. \n\nYou made the best decision possible by leaving him and I\u2019m happy for your new beginning with Mr. Punk Rock - if you eventually do want children and he\u2019s shown you he\u2019s up for the adventure, I hope he\u2019s everything in a dad a kid could want, and everything you could have hoped for (and more) in a partner. You deserve to be happy \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Good for you! I\u2019m glad you are finally living your life.\n\nI am like you on the subject of having information withheld. My mother does something similar. She does it because she convinces herself it would be too distressing to the other person but in reality, SHE does not want to deal with negative or emotional reactions from loved ones. Recently my father was admitted to the Hospital from being very sick. There was a chance he wouldn\u2019t make it. He has been sick for a while now and we all know he may not have much longer. My mother did not want to tell my brother or my niece. She said \u201cyou know how Robert just freaks out..\u201d well yeah, his dad may be dying and it\u2019s normal to freak out. She didn\u2019t want to tell my niece, age 20,  because \u201cyou know she just had two wisdom teeth cut out a week ago..\u201d ok I know she had dental issues but she deserves to know what\u2019s going on with her paw, who she loves dearly. I was like \u201cmom do you think it\u2019s fair to them to keep them in the dark? What if he doesn\u2019t make it and they didn\u2019t even get a chance to come see him? How would you feel?\u201d She agreed and finally told them. When she did, my niece asked mom over and over if she promises she is telling her everything. She was doubtful that she was being 100% honest. I pointed out that the reason she is like that is because she doesn\u2019t expect you to tell her all of it. That\u2019s just a recent example but there have been many things and continues to be things, over the years she\u2019s not forthcoming about. It\u2019s only when shit hits the fan and she has no choice that I, find out things.",
            "This post made me cry, I'm so so  happy for you! And please ignore those who are saying it doesnt sound bad, emotional abuse can be crippling and cause so many mental issues or lead to suicide. I hope the guy you're with treats you well and that you have a wonderful life <3",
