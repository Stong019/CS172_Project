I'm going to repost it here, I hope that isn't against the rules.\n\n\nMy parent's have been married for almost 30 years. Their marriage is not great. My dad's the kind of person who will come home from work and get angry that there isn't dinner on the table. Growing up, my dad never treated my mother like an equal. She was expected to do all the housework and look after the children, and dote on her husband at all times. \n\n\nMy parents have been empty nesting for a few years now. I have one younger sister, and we are both out of the house and have our own lives. Neither of us kids have particularly LIKED our dad. Like, we love him in the way that you love family, and we are grateful that he provided for us and helped us pay for college. But my dad is an asshole who treats my mom poorly, and I never respected him for this. \n\n\nI recently got brunch with my mother, and she dropped some pretty heavy news. She's planning on divorcing my father. I was honestly relieved and happy for her that she's finally doing this, but her plan to do so is rather troubling. \n\n\nMy parents are Chinese immigrants. My dad's best friend growing up (Daniel) and his family have been saving up for a trip to the US for years. They will be visiting my parents over Christmas. My dad, naturally, put the burden of this whole trip on my mother. He told her to organize their whole vacation, planning meals, reservations, activities, etc. Basically my mom is expected to be the complete tour guide and handle all the stress and organization of their visit (including picking them up from the airport) while my dad just gets to hang out with his childhood friend and not deal with anything. My mom doesn't even KNOW these people.\n\n\nApparently, however, this was the last straw for my mom. She is retaliating. She has only been pretending to organize this trip and faked a bunch of reservations and stuff to appease my dad. My dad thinks everything is organized and Daniel's family is being completely taken care of. Her plan, instead, is to serve him with divorce papers the day she is supposed to pick up Daniel's family from the airport. My dad will be out of town on business up until the day Daniel arrives, so she will be moved out by then. Daniel's family will be stranded at the airport, and my dad will come home to an empty house and no family. \n\n\nWhile I support the divorce, I can't help but feel like this plan is a little too cruel. She can be as vindictive towards my father as she wants, but to drag another family into this seems unfair. My dad completely deserves this, but Daniel didn't do anything, and his family doesn't deserve to fly into the US and face this level of commotion.\n\n\nIs it my place to say anything? I voiced to my mother my concerns and she basically was like \"fuck it and fuck him.\" I barely talk to my father, but I don't know who I should reach out to or who I can talk some sense into. \n\n\nMy dad has never been violent towards my mom or anything, but I'm also nervous about what would happen if I told my father the truth before my mom has had a chance to gather herself and move out of the house without him being present. It just seems like an explosive argument waiting to happen. \n\n\n\n**tl;dr**: My dads family friends are visiting. My mother was assigned the responsibility to handle their whole trip, including picking them up from the airport. Instead, my mom is going to do nothing and serve my dad divorce papers, leaving this visiting family stranded and cause a lot of commotion.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Now, on to the update...**\n\nThank you to everyone who replied. It's been about a month since my post. Reading everyones responses made a few things to me very clear, that I especially had not thought of before:\n\n\n* It is highly unlikely that Daniel's family being \"stranded\" at a large international airport in the US would be that big of an issue. They speak good enough English, they have cell phones, they have money, they have my Dad's contact information. \n\n\n* My mom's decision to wait for him to get his news until he returns from his trip is a strategic one, so she can move out calmly and safely. While my father is not physically abusive, he certainly would not let my mom leave comfortably. She doesn't need that stress. \n\n\n* While some suggested that I step in and take over her duties, others claimed that it was risky for me to take over this role--my father may then just see me as replacement for his wife. This may set a bad precedent. \n\n\n* While I initially found her plan to be cruel, some of you rightly pointed out that surely this act of cruelty pales tremendously compared to the years of mistreatment she has dealt with. \n\n\nSo, Reddit, I opted to know nothing and do nothing. Here's what happened. Around the time Daniel's family was to be picked up, I get a phone call from my father. I decided (especially since this was the middle of a workday) to ignore it, because I frankly did not want to get wrapped up in the commotion. He called again and then sent me a series of texts, demanding to know the whereabouts of my mother. \n\n\nNow, if you recall, my father had been on a business trip this entire week. His first chain of messages/calls was when had a layover in Denver. He was to be in Denver for 3 hours before he could get on his connection home. This means that, at this point, my dad is aware that Daniel's family has not been picked up (because Daniel obviously called my father) and that my mother was not answering her phone, but he did not know why. He also called my younger sister, who said she genuinely had no idea what was going on, but also lived out of state so was unable to help (I later find out that my sister was also briefed by my mother about what might happen so that she wouldn't get caught off guard, and she was just playing a fool to help my mother along). I eventually text my dad back saying I have no idea what is going on, but I'm very busy at work and won't be able to get back to him for a while.\n\n\nMy dad, unable to find immediate answers, told Daniel there must have been some miscommunication. He told them to get a cab from the airport to the house and just make themselves at home until my father could get to them. He gave Daniel the keycode to the house, told him to call back once Daniel and his family were safely at home.  \n\n\nHere's where things get a bit theatrical. My mother apparently attached the divorce papers to an easel, with a nice big DIVORCE label and note, and placed the easel right at the entrance hall to the house so it's the first thing you see once you open the door. So, as you guess it, who get's the divorce news first? Daniel and his family. Daniel then has to tell my father that my mother is divorcing him. \n\n\nThis is precisely what happens (Daniel recounts this in private to me later, which is how I know). But apparently my father went through a range of emotions, from disbelief, to a fumbling stutter, to anger, you name it. This, by the way, is happening while he is at the Denver airport, surrounded by his colleagues. He then has to, presumably, give some sort of explanation to his work friends and deal with an awkward and uncomfortable plane ride back home. \n\n\nLong story short, my dad was incredibly embarrassed and flustered. He had no idea what to do or how to help himself or anyone. Daniel actually ended up coming to the rescue, because he is apparently quite the meticulous planner and had many suggestions for activities and sightseeing. Basically, Daniel took charge of his own vacation, while my dad fumbled around like a lost puppy, just tagging along their trip while being completely discombobulated. \n\n\nI expected my dad to put on a farce for Daniel and his family and pretend things were fine, but he was unable to do that at all. I think he legitimately and honestly believed that my mom would never leave him, and was too much at a loss for words to even be angry. \n\n\nLater on, I stepped in to help out Daniel's family and make sure they were doing okay, giving my dad some time to himself. Overall, while they weren't wined and dined in quite the way the probably expected, Daniel seemed like a good and understanding friend, and they managed to have a productive vacation. Daniel said towards the end, when the shock had worn off, my dad and he were able to have a little fun. It was probably a good thing that Daniel was around to help my dad through it. \n\n\nAs for my parents, in general, they are only communicating through their lawyers. My mom moved out to her own apartment. She hasn't told my father where she lives, and I am completely staying out of it. My mom seems like a brand new person to me. I am incredibly happy for her for being so brave and finally taking charge of her own life.\n\n\nMy dad is pathetic and completely helpless. He's been wrapping himself up in his work and eating lots of takeout. I've been careful with my involvement: I will be supportive enough so he doesn't feel completely alone, but I am adamant to not become some sort of caregiver for him. I refuse to answer questions about my mothers whereabouts, but I do express sympathy for her. It's important for me to make sure my father recognizes that honestly, I am on my mothers side, and that I never agreed with the way he treated her. That being said, I am also careful not to antagonize my parents towards each other. I want this breakup to be as clean as possible.  \n\n\n**tl;dr** I didn't intervene. Daniel had to get to the house on his own, where he found my parents divorce papers. Daniel had to tell my father that my mother was divorcing him. Daniel ended up taking charge of his own vacation, my dad tagged along, I helped a little. My mom is on her own and happier than ever, my dad is completely lost.",

            "I'm so happy for your Mom. I think you have played it just right. Thanks for the update, I wondered how things ended up going for her.",
            "(Warning: long story.)\nWhoa this is so weird, I had to reread your title and make sure my siblings or my alter ego(???) didn't write this post. We're the exact same age and our parents are the exact same age and my mom just left my physically and verbally abusive dad last fall.\n\nAs soon as my youngest sibling left for college, we packed up essentials and disappeared. We had to hurry and move everything in less than a work day (uhaul and all in under 6 hours ugh), so when he came home, our stuff was gone and there were divorce papers on the counter with a letter from my mom. It sounds cruel, but there was no way she could have done this in person and left unscathed. He left us threatening and guilt tripping voicemails for months and even tracked her down at work a few times but she always saw his car first and hid.\n\nWhat's much crueler is abusing your wife and kids for 20+ years and threatening to put a bullet in our heads if we ever told anyone (or did anything remotely out of line), which made for very dark and lonely lives for all of us. We went no contact and the first few months were rough, looking over our shoulders constantly and dealing with the fallout with whomever he told his \"sob story\". In the end, we really see this like a new lease on life. \n\nMy dad doesn't know where we are and we're all breathing so much easier now that we're no longer essentially hostages in our own home. My mom got a new apartment and the furniture that she wanted and eats what she wants and sees her friends and goes on trips with her friends. She has become a totally different person, so much bubblier and happy.\n\nTL;DR My father was also an asshole, we disappeared and left him divorce papers. We are safe now and can finally work towards leading normal lives.",

He yells at my mom if she doesn't do things his way, and doesn't do anything around the house (leaving my mom to run the household while maintaining a professor music teaching job and take care of my grandma who lives with us). My mom has a heart condition and osteoporosis, but she will still shovel the driveway because my dad doesn't do it. Things like that. He'll yell at her if she says or does anything remotely against what he wants (e.g. my sister, who is 20 years old and in university at home, is driven everywhere, gives my mom A MEAL PLAN and does no chores at home) - my mom spoke up once and got yelled at full blast about how my sister has to concentrate on school etc (even though she failed a prerequisite course last year and is now half a year behind). My dad and his family (2 sisters and a brother) also demand that my parents pay them a certain amount of money each month - my dad says it's fine to help family out (while this has been going on for almost 30 years), but my mom got mad one year because she said they should at least send an email or note or something each time just to say they received the money. Nope. Got yelled at instead by my dad.  \n\nAnyways, didn't mean to ramble on so much about my own life there (I am so sorry) -  it is just nice to see someone else who sort of relates.

A few weeks ago, I was finishing up my breakfast outside the train station, and a little piece of toast got stuck in my windpipe. I tried to cough it back up but I couldn't breathe, and started freaking out. I ran to the nearest people, two men in their 20s/30s, and made it clear I was choking. One of them had a water bottle and I was able to drink some and dislodge the piece of toast. The two men were very concerned and made sure I was okay before I left, which I appreciated very much. I thanked them profusely and went on my way to work. I thought I would be done with this whole situation, but then things got weird. \n\nA few days after the choking incident, I was walking home from the store and all of a sudden a man runs up to me to stop me. I realize it was one of the men who helped save me, and he introduced himself (let\u2019s call him \u201cJohn\u201d). We started talking and I thanked him again. He then started telling me he\u2019s been thinking about me every day and talking to me about religion and how he thinks God put me in his life. He then asked where I lived, to which I gave a very vague answer, and said \u201cI\u2019m not going to ask for your number right now, but I would like to get to know you.\u201d I told him that I am in a relationship, but that didn\u2019t really seem to sink in. I told him I had to go, and the conversation ended with him saying \u201cI know I\u2019ll see you again.\u201d \n\nI saw him again the next morning. He was standing outside the subway/metro entrance I normally use (and where I choked). I realized it was him and tried to quickly go past him so he wouldn't recognize me\u2026but once I was almost at the end of the escalator, I heard someone running down the steps. Sure enough, it was John. He had run all the way down the escalator to catch up with me, and he said \u201cI\u2019m glad I saw you again. I\u2019ll always be here for you.\u201d I was really shocked, and said something like \u201coh\u201d before I turned and hurriedly walked to the train platform. \n\nAfter that incident, I started taking a different entrance to the train. I hadn\u2019t seen him for a week\u2026until I saw him again today. I was walking home from the store with my boyfriend, and all of a sudden I saw someone come up from behind my boyfriend. I realized it was John but acted like I didn\u2019t see him, and kept focusing on talking to my boyfriend. John got weirdly close to my boyfriend and was staring at me, seeming like he was going to say something to me, but then he pulled back and my boyfriend and I walked away. After I told my boyfriend that it was John, we checked to make sure he wasn\u2019t following us, and used the back entrance to our apartment. \n\nI am at a loss regarding what to do or what to think. I\u2019m grateful to John and his friend for saving my life, but his behavior has become very inappropriate and weirdly threatening. From speaking with him, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s not something quite \u201cright\u201d about him, and I have no idea if he would have violent tendencies if I were to tell him to leave me alone. I hate feeling so trapped, and RESENT that this is the reality of being a woman in this world (can\u2019t I just have a near death experience and have it not turn into some stalking situation??!?!). How should I approach this? Should I confront him or tell him off? Is this the beginning of behavior/stalking that is more sinister? Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you. \n  \nEDIT: I should have made this more clear, but I expressed my disinterest in him multiple times during the second encounter. When he said he wanted to get to know me, I told him that I wasn't interested, that I needed to get on with my life, and that I am in fact in a relationship. The other two encounters happened too quickly and caught me too off guard for me to say anything, and as many others have pointed out, there is always the question of safety when faced with a man who can't seem to take \"no\" for an answer. Thank you for all the words of advice and support; I really do appreciate it. \n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: A stranger who helped save me from choking to death keeps appearing when I\u2019m walking in my neighborhood, saying things like \u201cI want to get to know you\u201d and \u201cGod put you into my life.\u201d How do I approach this behavior?",

            "This is absolutely stalking and not okay. Next time he approaches you, tell him firmly, \"You're making me uncomfortable. Please stop following me and approaching me. I just want you to leave me alone.\"\n\nIf he tries to argue and follow you, or if he approaches you again, go directly to a metro employee. If you see a police officer, even better -- but the employee will be able to summon one quickly. The nice thing about city train stations is that the police are typically around or ready to come at a moment's notice. Point him out to the officer and explain the situation. They will deal with it and tell you how to escalate if this ever happens again.",
            "I'd actually go to the police now, and not wait for it to happen again. They don't need to haul up and arrest him, but the sooner you make them aware that this risk is present, the sooner you can feel safe and secure. That way, if (god forbid) something bad happens or it gets worse, they already have a lead and a record on file. Try and document your interactions with him/things he's said, and as everyone is saying, get it on the record (and to his person, if he comes up again) that he's making you uncomfortable. \"I'm not interested in pursuing this relationship. Stop contacting me.\" \n\nAlso if he approaches you again in public, make sure that your statement about him leaving you alone is loud. You don't have to scream, but make sure passerby can hear you/are paying attention. \n\nIf you feel really unsafe, use the buddy system (your boyfriend, friend, a dog, pretend phone call) when you go out and about so someone else knows about your whereabouts or can provide you with an out like an appointment, movie showing, etc. ",
            "The part where he thinks god put you in his life is the really scary part. That kind of statement could signal the kind of crazy that thinks it knows what you need better than you do - like, I'm worried about how he was looking at your boyfriend. This doesn't seem like the kind of guy who is going to take no for an answer. I don't know that I have better advice than any you're already being given here, just please don't talk yourself out of taking it, and stay near metro police or employees as much as possible! If he approaches you outside a store, go in the store and say your Go Away speech where people can hear you!",
            "Jeeze, this is awful, I'm so sorry this is happening to you. \n\nYou should probably start by telling him, in no uncertain terms, to fuck off and stop trying to wedge himself into your life. Bring your boyfriend with you as backup. You're being too nice/nonconfrontational to the guy (something that society trains women to do, unfortunately, so I don't blame you for trying that tactic), and dudes like him see polite/awkward \"no\"s as \"if you try harder, YES\".  If he continues after being told to fuck off, it's time to get his full name and call the cops/get a restraining order.",
            "Ugh. If I were you, I might make a plan of what I want to say next time I see him, so that I can feel in control of the situation. I would even practice in the mirror. It sounds like you want to not have him follow or contact you again, and you are afraid of his (potentially unhinged) reaction. So you probably want this to happen with witnesses or allies (like your boyfriend) around, and be able to leave quickly afterwards. You probably also want to de-escalate and not increase his interest or ability to follow you.\n\n\nNow this is more what I might do: I would want to keep it light but firm. My style would be to say something like this: \n\"John, I hope that what you would do for me for anyone. It's important in the city that when things happen, strangers can help each other. But we are strangers and we are going to stay that way. I have noticed you following me multiple times, and I'm not OK with that. I do not want you to follow me or look for me any longer. We have nothing else to say to each other. You need to respect my wish for privacy. Goodbye.\" And then just leave. I wouldn't want to get into a further conversation at all. \n\n\nAnd then if you see him again, call the police or transit police.\n\nUgh. I'm sorry this is happening to you. It must feel so gross. I hope you find your own words to create that boundary, and the strength to enforce it.",

            "There's honestly a lot of dangerous information here. When you're dealing with a stalker it's not the time to be a badass and vindicate all womankind (and I speak as an ardent feminist). You might want to look into Marc MacYoung's no nonsense self defense website. I really dislike how he characterizes feminism and PC culture yada yada, and his rape prevention strategies can come across as very victim blame-y, but he does have good advice that expands upon what you might find in The Gift of Fear. \n\nTrust your gut on this one: does this guy seem potentially violent or threatening? Let's review your language in this post. You've described him as \"weird\" and most importantly, \"threatening.\" You have also expressed worry about whether he is violent. You also say there is something not quite \"right.\" \n\nAre your instincts correct? Let's review his behaviour: he is stalking you, and he is escalating. He waited outside the metro entrance, followed you onto the platform (instead of just observing), and he knows the store you frequent. He has approached you when you have company, specifically your boyfriend, and behaved in a threatening manner by staring at you. He has asked for your address. Through his speech (specifically with references to God), he has shown that he feels entitled to you. Not just your time or energy, but you. \n\nTelling your boyfriend and taking care to not show him where you live is a great idea. Please expand on that and invest in your home invasion security measures, because honestly if he's this obsessive he might be observing just for the day you slip up. Tell your friends, your coworkers, your neighbours, the workers at the store, the metro employees. If you have a picture, or even just a good description, let them know, and get it into their heads that they must TELL you if they see him around! File a police report (and if they try to dismiss you DO NOT LET THEM AND INSIST) and a restraining order, and begin documenting everything. If you're afraid of violence (if he sees you documenting) then just turn on your voice recorder on your phone every time you exit the subway. In the meantime, if you can afford to take an Uber from a couple of stops away or have friends drive you home, do that, and also conceal your appearance while at it. \n\nDo you think confronting him would work? If you want, you can do it in a PUBLIC place in front of metro employees and/or police, and make it polite but firm. Asserting your dominance verbally can be dangerous because you don't know if he is carrying a weapon, just say that you don't want to see him again and to not follow you. His reaction could be very telling. \n\nI don't want to scare you, but please take this seriously. Don't wonder if your feelings are valid (they are) or if he's just nice if a little clueless (he is again, ESCALATING instead of de-escalating). \n\nIf you want local resources, hit up a woman's shelter and ask for help. They're experienced with domestic partners but I'm sure they have contacts with orgs and know of general reporting procedures. ",
            "> He then started telling me he\u2019s been thinking about me every day and talking to me about religion and how he thinks God put me in his life\n\nThis guy is crazy, and the fact that he's *running* up to you and getting in your personal space is further proof. I'm not sure if he'll respond to a standard, \"You're making me uncomfortable, please stay away.\"\n\nStep one, go to the police. Step two, next time he approaches, YELL at him. Lift up on your feet, make your shoulders wide and yell at the top of your lungs, \"LEAVE ME ALONE. I DON'T KNOW YOU. STAY AWAY FROM ME. STOP FOLLOWING ME.\" This should have a handful of results:\n\n1) It should (ideally) make you feel braver. Martial artists will often yell before a fight.\n\n2) It will scare and/or startle your attacker. \n\n3) it will attract the attention of the people around you, thus making it harder for this guy to get near you. \n\n4) this guy will think twice about approaching you again. But you should carry some personal protection on you in case he decides to try his luck in more isolated areas. \n\nGood luck.",
            "I actually think you need to inform the police right now about this guy, either in person at the station or via the non-emergency line. He's approached you three times already, and is making you feel trapped and unsafe in your own neighbourhood. That's not something you should have to put up with, OP.\n\nAs others have already said, if he follows you again loudly tell him that you're uncomfortable and that he needs to leave you alone. Make it loud enough so that people around you can hear, but keep it succinct; you don't want to engage with this guy for any longer than is necessary. If he protests go straight to a nearby place where there is security present and inform them what's going on.\n\nI'm so sorry you're in this situation. I had a very brief incident myself with a guy a few years ago, which wasn't even in the same ballpark as your situation, but I remember the wave of nausea whenever I saw him all too well and can definitely sympathise. Stay safe.",

I just wanted to comment on a couple of things:\n\n>John got weirdly close to my boyfriend and was staring at me, seeming like he was going to say something to me, but then he pulled back and my boyfriend and I walked away.\n\nUgh.  The only time he *didn't* inject himself into your life was when your boyfriend was there -- typical \"woman as property\" behavior.\n\n>From speaking with him, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s not something quite \u201cright\u201d about him, and I have no idea if he would have violent tendencies if I were to tell him to leave me alone.\n\nMost people who are psychologically \"different\" are not violent, and are actually more likely to be victims of violence rather than violent offenders.

            "**1**. The police won't do too much unless there is evidence that he's stalking you constantly, by which I mean more than just following you from the train station. \n\n**2**. Set your phone to record the next time you see him at the station, and tell him bluntly that you appreciated his help and understand that he might have some \"hero\" complex, b/c it was not a big a deal as he thinks it was in his head. Then tell him that he is making you uncomfortable and to leave you alone. \n\n**3**. If he says \"ok\" nonchalantly and leaves or gets mildly offended and leaves, then that might be the end of it. If he gets **very** emotional, either sad or angry, find an attendant and tell them immediately.\n\n**4**. Make sure he doesn't follow you to where you work, and watch for him on the metro train and make sure he doesn't end up at another stop you take. If he does either of these things, record it and then call the cops, b/c you have an obvious stalker situation, and now you have evidence.\n\n**I've dealt with a very similar situation**. Even though I'm a male, I take the metro to work everyday b/c my job is in the middle of the city and I live in the suburbs, so it beats driving in, when I was walking to my stop, these two women pulled up and said they were lost, so I gave them some help and went on my way. They u-turned and stopped me again and asked if I could come with them to show them and they would pay me for my help. This is normally how muggings happen, so I said I was a tourist and only knew the street names not locations of places.\n\nThey followed me to the metro and I noticed one got out of the car and got on the same train. I switched trains a few times and lost them. \n\nSo just keep your phone recording if you see him again, be blunt and if you know he's following you past the train station, then hurry to your job and tell them to call the cops and look to make sure they see what you see. Also, I'd recommend walking to the metro with someone, either a co-worker or your bf if you guys work close, even if you have to wait after work for them.",
            "He obviously feels an obligation to you. I would confront him with your bf. Just be honest,  \"look im grateful truly, but this has to stop.

            "Hey OP I hope you read this because I see a lot of people are advising you to go to the police, yet the police are unlikely to be about to help you in this situation. Depending on how your state words the law, I doubt this person has actually met the threshold for \"stalking\", I'm not dismissing that he makes you feel uncomfortable, just pointing out the words like stalking have specific legal meanings. You should contact them and see if they can help. But if they can't here's what I suggest. \n\nHe may or may not be an actual threat to you. You should treat him as a potential threat, but remember he may just be mentally slow and like you.\n\nIf it's legal in your area get and carry some pepperspray/mace. \n\nA little primer on legally using spray; you can't just spray him if he talks to you again. He needs to do something that elevates him from creep to immediate threat. \n\nNow, if he does anything to try to restrict your movement (grabs your arm, tries to steer you by the shoulder etc) or otherwise presents an immediate threat (immediate verbal threat, fighting posture etc) then you'll want to spray him. The purpose of pepperspray is to give you a couple of seconds to escape, so spray and run. Once a safe distance call 911 and report the incident. \n\nMake sure you get a can of spray you can actually operate under stress, those Keychain  ones with the leather pouch are too hard to use under stress. \n\nI recommend the First Defense/Defense Technology Mk-6 (make sure you get the \"stream\" model), it's small but is easy to operate. Get two, practice with one (outside!!!) by spraying it at some cardboard. \n\nPepperspray is not meant to counter a lethal threat, like a knife or gun. But it's better to have than nothing. If you're a gun person and in a state where it's legal of course I recommend CCW, however the decision to carry a gun is not something you should do based on one reddit post. If you want to do that seek appropriate training and learn your options.\n\nBe alert at all times. \n\nMake sure when you're out and about you are paying close attention to your surroundings at all times. Your objective is to spot him before he can spot you. If you do see him choose an alternative path to avoid him. If an alternate path is not available try to find an authority figure to accompany you (eg metro security guard or police officef)  as you go past him. You can just explain that he's creeped you out a couple of times and would appreciate if they would escort you past him. They probably will. \n\nIf that's not available stay in a large group of people. The objective is to avoid giving him a chance at a one on one encounter. \n\nYour plan should go like this ALERT, AVOID, DEFEND, ESCAPE \n",

Since his death, my in-laws have been beside themselves, statements like \u201cthey never saw this coming\u201d and \u201che was SO young, it could happen to ANYONE\u201d have been common. The thing is, my BIL was not the paragon of health. Frankly, I\u2019m surprised he made it to 34. First, my BIL lived with his parents and worked as a library assistant. He worked from 11-7, would get two large pizzas on his way home, eat the pizzas, leftovers at home, drink 1 or 2 2L sodas and smoke probably more than a pack of cigarettes (20 regular cigarettes) an evening. He hadn\u2019t eaten a vegetable in more than 20 years \u2013 something he was proud of \u2013 had diabetes, a bad back (which is why he couldn\u2019t exercise) and would help wind-down every evening with about a gallon of cheap beer. He\u2019d wake-up at 8:45, microwave himself a few breakfast sandwiches/burritos (7 or 8) and would smoke another 10 cigarettes. He\u2019d toddle off to work. He did that M-F, on Sat & Sun, he laid in bed till 2, watched TV, chain smoked cigarettes, ordered either Chinese take-out (meat only) or burgers, would drink beer from 4 until 1 or 2 AM and then pass out. He literally never left his room. \n\nBIL was warned by numerous doctors to get healthier, cut the smokes, stop drinking and to clean up, but he never did. Even when he got diabetes and spent almost a week in hospital, it didn\u2019t phase him. He had begun to walk with a cane \u2013 he was only about 5\u20197 but well north of 350lbs. He didn\u2019t drink water, he didn\u2019t eat a vegetable, he lived in his room and was never, ever healthy. Last year, he suffered a major heart attack and required emergency bypass surgery. He barely made it through the surgery, he was so unhealthy that he nearly passed away many times during surgery/recovery. He spent 3 weeks in the hospital. \n\nHe got home and immediately resumed his habits. Just days after he got home, he was in bed, with a bag of cookies on his chest and an ashtray next to his bed. The home care workers tried, his surgeons tried, everyone tried to break him of his habit\u2026 Except his parents who didn\u2019t want to upset their son\u2026.\n\nAnyway, a couple of months after surgery he died in bed. He had deteriorated rapidly, could barely move, had no energy, was white & gaunt and had trouble breathing. He refused medical attention and finally passed away. It was tragic, and everyone mourned. Since then, my in-laws have had their eyes-opened to the fragility of life and have been booking the ENTIRE family on events. I went along with it for a while, but it\u2019s gotten excessive \u2013 we\u2019re expected to be with them every Saturday (even when they just sit around telling stories about someone who never existed\u2026); we\u2019re expected to be there when they need support and they\u2019ve began booking us for every holiday: Thanksgiving & Christmas are being renamed \u201cBIL Remembrance Days\u201d. No celebration but rather informal wakes will be held in his honor. \n\nI get they are sad and upset, but this is beyond crazy. My wife [28/F] has another sister [34/F] and brother [37/M].  They & their partners think this is getting out of hand. They\u2019ve all pulled out of these events, but my wife won\u2019t stand up to her parents. She\u2019s the baby and doesn\u2019t want to disappoint them. The thing is, it\u2019s gone way beyond. My birthday involved my in-laws coming over and making a \u201cspeech\u201d (more like a lecture) about how deceased BIL would love this party. It went on for well over an hour, attempts to stop them failed and finally my mother had to physically remove them. They apologized when it became obvious everyone was so uncomfortable that they left. \n\nThey need therapy, but they think this is all part of the grieving process. They refuse to talk to someone; they refuse to get help in any way whatsoever leaving my wife to carry the burden and for me to deal with their shit. They both informally \u201cretired\u201d but can\u2019t afford it; they didn\u2019t really do their taxes (so I\u2019m dealing with it) and aren\u2019t keeping up with bills, so I\u2019m their financial advisor. I haven\u2019t had a weekend to myself in 5 months and I don\u2019t want to give up holidays with my folks, so my in-laws can make-up stories about their son. I've had to help my FIL apply for jobs; I've had to give my MIL prepaid visa gift cards to prevent her from going wild on spending. I've structured their finances in such a way that they are okay, but what they need is long-term mental help to get them working again. \n\nI know it sounds cold & callous, but I\u2019ve hit my limit. How can I get my wife to take my side and deal with her parents who obviously need therapy and support? \n\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: BIL ate & drank himself to death and has sent my in-laws off the deep end. I can't handle their crap, renaming holidays after my BIL and need 1 weekend away from them. Wife won't stand up to them as she's afraid to disappoint them. ",

I'm not saying leave them hanging out to dry, but you don't \"have\" to help your FIL, you don't \"have\" to give your MIL gift cards. You can TAKE a weekend for yourself. Your wife's siblings have bailed on events, **so can you**. Your wife still insists on going? Great, she can go, *but you stay home*. At the moment the status quo is working, just about, for everyone except you. If you back out, even a tiny bit, everyone will have to rearrange things. But so long as you're picking up all the slack, there's zero incentive for your in laws to get themselves help, and there's zero incentive for your wife to rock the boat.",
            "Can your SIL and other BIL talk to your wife as well? I don\u2019t mean in a \u201cgang up on her\u201d sort of way, but just having one of them call her to share their feelings about how their parents need actual therapy and how they\u2019re not going to xyz event because their own families need them too. It might help her to hear it from someone else who\u2019s in her exact position. Ideally she\u2019d listen to you and your concerns right away, but it seems like she\u2019s shouldering the parental grief so it might take more than you.\n\nThroughout all of this, you do not want to demonize the brother or the parents. Yes, his early death was likely preventable, but that doesn\u2019t make his loss any less significant. Don\u2019t talk about how anyone could have seen this coming or his old habits. That\u2019s something the parents will sort out on their own if they ever get into therapy. It\u2019s also horribly, horribly depressing having to bury a child, so their grief is understandable (but obviously not their coping mechanisms). Don\u2019t frame this as all the things *they\u2019re* doing wrong, but rather how everything affects *you.*\n\nExample: Wife, I have spent the last x weekends and all my free time helping your parents get back on their feet. I\u2019ve done xyz and I am exhausted. I am not an accountant, a therapist, or a pension and neither are you. I am going to hit my limit soon. I want your family to be stable again, but *we alone* cannot be responsible for everything. It\u2019s going to burn us both out and that\u2019s not healthy for anyone. I can\u2019t abandon my family for all the holidays and I can\u2019t be at every single event. I need to recharge. We need to think of how we can help your parents get the support they need from systems and other people, not just us.\n\nAnd then follow through. Don\u2019t take on extra tasks. Give them the contact information/instructions for things they can do themselves. When that weekend rolls around, ask your wife to leave the phones on silent and take a nice long walk. Breathe. Eat good food. Watch TV. Do what you need to do and invite her to join you because you\u2019re both going to snap if you don\u2019t.",
            "They enabled your BIL and now you\u2019re enabling them. Stop helping them with their finances and entertaining their reveries. They need consequences if they\u2019re ever going to change their own behavior.",
            "First, talk to your wife about how you are feeling, explain that your current behavior is enabling them, and tell her you need a break from everything that is happening. Encourage her to talk to her parents about counseling and tell her she should also stop enabling them. You should not need to sacrifice your own sanity to help others. ",
            "You don't need your wife to stand up to them. You only need to back off and start making other plans on the weekend.

            "They enabled your BIL, and now you're enabling them. Clearly they are grieving, and utterly misguided in how they related to their son, but if they're otherwise decent people there's no need to be cruel to them so soon after his death. That being said, there's a difference between \"Sorry, I have other plans this weekend\" (even if those plans are to sit on the couch and read) and \"Stop acting like insane people!!!\"\n\nThe former is acceptable, the latter is not. If your wife wants to spend her weekends with her parents without you - honestly, I'd let her. I imagine that a short time of being the only one catering to their needs is going to be a wake-up call for her - when you're there as well there's someone to share the load. \n\nMake plans with your parents/other family for holidays. If your wife chooses to go elsewhere, let her. It will be hard, but as I said it's likely short term pain for long term gain. \n\nIf you're handling their money, try and put some aside for therapy. They need it, so be blunt about it: \"Yes, I'm pulling away. After your totally unacceptable behaviour at my birthday it's clear you need more help than the family can give you. I know you're grieving and it's awful for you, and I want to help you find better ways to cope. This is a better way.\" Don't get into arguments, don't respond to \"Did you want us to just ignore BIL at your birthday, to never talk about him again?\" Keep repeating, like a broken record, \"I want to help you find better ways to cope\".

            "Others have given good advice about managing your in-laws' life affairs and stepping back for your own sanity. \n\nAs for the \"every holiday is a rememberance\" thing...look, it's been five months. For the first couple of years after my stepson's mother died, he and his sisters dragged a big framed photo along to basically sit in for her at Christmas picnics, birthday lunches, all sorts of things. The first time, we thought it was sweet, then when it kept happening we thought it was a bit awkward and mawkish and emotionally counterproductive. We didn't say anything, though - as the \"other family,\" you really can't. Once we got into the second year we sort of thought maybe this was the new normal. But it did peter out. It took longer than we expected, but it stopped. Even people who want to stay in their grief as a form of remembrance usually do get carried out of it by time. I would say to pick your battles here. Focus on getting their rest-of-lives in order, if you can, and grit your teeth through the special occasions for a while. It will probably pass.",

Your parents need help REAL help.\" and go from there. Go see your own family this holiday season. Stop in on the in laws if you must but don't get dragged into the grief party.",

            "First, I want to address something that you might find unpleasant - you obviously have some unresolved issues with the deceased BIL. You spent about half of your post detailing his various choices and health issues. Quite honestly, all of that isn't necessary to your broader question. The issue - not just as I see it, but based on your summary - is how to manage the relationship with your in-laws going forward. I'm not saying this to be critical of you. But I do think there might be some unresolved issues lingering that you might want to think about pertaining to the BIL. \n\nNow as far as the in-laws - there are a couple of phrases that I want to focus on. \n\n> How can I get my wife **to take my side** and deal with her parents who **obviously need** therapy and support?\n\nYou can't, and quite honestly you shouldn't want to. This, to me, is a dangerous mindset. People are complex. It's easy to look at other people's lives and decide how YOU (an outsider) would make different choices to repair what you perceive as the problems in their lives. The in-laws sound like they have issues they need to work on, but something you need to work on as well is this controlling mindset. It seems to either be cause or at least exacerbated by being put into the position of controlling their finances and other issues. \n\nYou can't control how the remaining family grieves. Death hurts, and can fuck up the lives of people left behind for years after the fact. My suggestion is for you to slowly move out of the position of responsibility and authority you are in now with respect to finances and everything else. That's step 1. Step 2 would be to work on finding a balance between letting them grieve in whatever process that takes with the needs you and your wife have with your family on holidays. Where I'm from, it's customary to alternate holidays with families. Christmas with my family one year, her family the next. Or, if possible, have \"family holiday\" on a day close to the actual holiday. But honestly, it feels like those are relatively minor issues that are incidental to what I perceive to be the biggest elephant in the room. \n\nI don't mean to come across as too confrontational or anything like that. But I do think your perspective on some of these issues is a bit off. I hope you know this is meant as constructive feedback from someone without any skin in the game. ",

They lost a son/brother at a young age, and it doesn't matter if he was really unhealthy--that's traumatic. Focus on how this is affecting you and your wife. You both need time to take care of your own needs and time to relax. You haven't seen your family and want to spend the holidays with them. You and your wife can't provide the support her parents need so it's time to call in some professionals. Enlist her siblings to help you talk to your wife about the situation. ",

If you absolutely need to see them, I absolutely need to spend a couple of days (catching up on home repair projects, vegging, sleeping in, taking my bike out before winter sets in). \n\nDearest, I really miss having time with just you and I.

She can only do this when she is ready. What you can do, is set boundaries around yourself. \n\nYou do not have to go to events if you can't handle them or need a night or weekend off. If it's really important to your wife, she can still go herself. This doesn't mean you are not supporting her, but that you are protecting your own well-being. If you feel like you can make a compromise with her on this, maybe you can agree to go to a certain number of events, for appearances, and after that she can go without you.\n\nThis really should not be your problem to manage. They're not even your parents! I firmly believe that when in laws are toxic like this, it's on their actual child to manage this and keep their toxicity away from their spouse, and not expect spouse to manage it.\n\nIt's okay to set boundaries around this for yourself. You may get push back from your wife as she's so conditioned to give in to whatever they want, so be empathetic to her, but firm on what you are and aren't willing to do going forward.\n\nGood luck. Xx ",
            "Have you considered starting small, and suggesting your wife seek some grief counseling?  She lost her brother, her parents fell apart, and her whole life got turned upside down.  Why her brother died doesn't change her grief, and in fact knowing it was likely preventable probably makes it worse for her.  She's not making great choices and likely needs some help processing how to best deal with her grief in a healthy way, and learn how to set appropriate boundaries with her parents.  It's clear she needs some help, and you sound like you're maybe too overwhelmed and too involved in the situation to be able to provide her with the objective and uninvolved viewpoint she needs right now.  \n\nAnd it sounds like maybe you need some help too, in learning how to set healthy boundaries, compassionately communicate your limitations, and deal with the major disruption to your life that your brother-in-law's death and the resulting change in your in-law's behavior brought about.\n\nAlso, it's time to call on your wife's family for help.  If you guys have been seamlessly taking care of her parents problems, the rest of the family probably doesn't know the real extent of how much you've been taking on or how much work it's been.  Her siblings need to be helping out, and it's time to let them know you guys have reached your breaking point and need to hand some tasks off to someone else.  ",

I would start by seeing if your wife would agree to counseling. I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s a lot more going on in her head than just being too afraid to stand up to her parents. Maybe once she\u2019s doing better, she can help her parents through this. In the meantime, set boundaries.

            "This isn't normal grieving behavior, I don't think. I mean, it's normal to still be sad about losing someone months, years, decades later. It's normal to want to talk about your loss sometimes, or even to get emotional at seemingly inappropriate times. It's NOT normal to try to hijack every single family event, and even make up new ones, just to talk about that person, for months and months.\n\nI don't think that his health in life is really relevant to the conversation; it has nothing to do with how sad they feel or should feel. They lost their son--the fact that they probably should have seen it coming doesn't make the loss any less painful or significant.\n\nCan you talk to them about their behavior? If you can, maybe tell them that you're worried about them, because they really don't seem to be coping well, but also make sure to set some boundaries with what you will and won't do for them. I think it's good to help them out from time to time, but you can't do everything for them. Right now it's like you're basically running their lives, leaving them totally dependent on you, which isn't good for either one of you. Also make sure to be clear that you need to put a limit on time spent together, and time talking about BIL because you need to take care of yourself and your own mental health as well. Tell them as gently as you can, it's not a punishment or anything for them you just need to take care of yourself.\n\nKeep working on them to get into therapy.

            "A part of the problem, I am afraid, seems to be your attitude. This post displays a troubling resentment and lack of empathy. You spend three paragraphs describing your disgust for your now-deceased BIL in a very judgmental, dehumanizing way. This was a difficult read as someone who's struggled with weight my whole life. It seems you looked at your BIL and saw mainly a number on a scale and a set of bad habits, because there's very little insight in all those paragraphs about what kind of man he was on the inside, e.g. his relationships, interests, and personality traits both positive and negative.\n\nThere are too many armchair obesity experts in the world. The short of it is that maintaining a healthy weight really isn't as easy and clear-cut as just eating good food and excercising regularly. Genetics play a huge role and there are numerous conditions that work in various ways to make it easy to gain weight and hard to take it off.\n\nYour ILs are going overboard and making unreasonable demands. But grief always unsettles people for a time, and there is no greater grief, perhaps, than that of parent forced to bury a child.\n\n>They need therapy, but they think this is all part of the grieving process. They refuse to talk to someone; they refuse to get help in any way whatsoever leaving my wife to carry the burden and for me to deal with their shit.\n\nIt's understandable that your ILs' demands are getting to you. They shouldn't be leaning so heavily on you and your wife in any situation. However, this is *their* grief, not yours. It isn't your place to dictate how they should process their son's death or for how long. It's clear from your post you think your BIL brought his death upon himself. But, to your ILs, he was their *son*, not his weight or poor choices. They are mourning a *person* they loved and knew for 34 years.\n\nYou don't have to do as much as you've been doing for your ILs. Don't be afraid to say no or set firm boundaries. But, at the same time, your lingering fixation with your BIL's weight and life choices and your apparent resentment of your ILs' grief aren't helpful.\n\nYour wife's older siblings should also step up to the plate and do their part to help instead of dumping it all on her and you.",

Your feelings for the deceased are irrelevant; it's their child. It's only been 5 months. Support right now may be, in part, respecting a traditional public mourning period, so instead of trying to get your wife to take up your side, take up hers and support that a while longer while encouraging her to set them up with professional grief counseling as well, which surely can't hurt. You seem like you've been very helpful to them in holding their finances together during this time.

Treat them like adults. \n\n\"MIL, FIL, I am no longer able to manage your finances. I've given you a detailed budget, coping stratagies for poor spending tendencies, and boundless advice.

Her parents didn't want to upset her brother, so they enabled his unhealthy behavior.\n\nIt's got to stop.  She is unwise to sacrifice her marriage, and you, on the altar of appeasing her parents.  Your marriage should come first, and honestly, she is not helping her parents grieve by helping them have a whole parade of memorial services.  It does nobody any good to have them transfer their unhealthy behavior from your deceased BIL to you.\n\nIs there some way you can transfer the financial advisor stuff to someone who does it for a living, and get it off your plate?  I would also tell your wife that you are not attending any more memorial services for her brother, and if that's what the holidays are going to be, celebrate with your own family or friends.  Or maybe her siblings who are done with the whole memorial service thing.\n\nOne form of abuse is for someone to act helpless to try to make someone feel obligated to them.  Are her parents really incapable of handling general life stuff, or are they just extending their \"grieving\" so that they \"need help\"?  I don't know, I'm just asking, because this seems really odd.\n\nOh, and just as a comparison: the people we consider family who live near us we see about once a month, which includes about half the major holidays (Christmas, Thanksgiving, Labor Day, Memorial Day, 4th of July, New Year's Eve.)",

My relationship with my mom is already strained because she has never been a kind person, and she has some narcissistic tendencies. This week she told my wife what she planned on doing for the big food item at the shower. My wife said it sounded good, then said if my mom still needed sides and treats, my wife found a mom's craving table idea, and sent 4 snack-like items she has been craving. My mom then snapped at her and said \"Did I ask for your input? Why don't you just show up and be happy?\" We were very taken aback and I have no idea where it came from. It is kind of the last straw and I want to set some new boundaries. My mother needs to know that she doesn't get to see her grandchild unless we say she can, and for her to be invited she cannot act like that. Would it be appropriate to talk to my dad about this first? My thought is I want to explain that he didn't do anything wrong and I'm sorry if this affects how much he gets to see his grandchild (my parents are still married)\n\n\nTL;DR on top of an already rocky relationship with me, my mother was aggressive towards my wife out of nowhere, and new boundaries are needed.

I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t said anything to your mom in that moment or yet about the way ag spoke to your wife.",
            "I would not ask my dad. I would tell him the new boundaries and why. I would also cancel any baby shower hosted by mom.",

Why don't you just show up and be happy?\"\n\nIf my MIL said that to me, I wouldn't show up at all. \n\nStand up for your wife, on your own. If you have your dad try to run interference and reel his wife in, she probably won't take him seriously and will continue to treat your wife like shit.",
            "I have been in your wife\u2019s position, my Mother in law has done some nasty things. I would defiantly suggest NOT going to your father first. Instead talking to both of them, without your wife present. I say without your wife because there is a chance your mom or parents, will say some horrible stuff about your wife. It\u2019s not that your wife shouldn\u2019t know what is said, it\u2019s that it is YOUR job to deal with your family. Your wife has enough to deal with, this is on you. So get that backbone of yours ready to be taking some pressure. And be prepared to stand your ground.\n\nIt is common for family to remember and treat us like we are at a certain age, usually to exert power and control over us. ie treating you like your 15 because at that age your mom had power over you. \nDon\u2019t fall for it, you are and adult and about to be a father. Stand up for yourself and demand to be recognized as a adult. Expect to hear your mom say \u201c I am your mother.\u201d \u201c you have to do what I say.\u201d  She is not going to want to give up her power, especially if she has Narc tendencies. She may cry, scream, plead, and demand, but you can not bend. So have a plan before you walk in there and stick to it. \nYour father may choose to stand by his wife, that is his choice. Or he may side with you, he is an adult it is his choice. \n\nRegardless of what your dad does it\u2019s  time for boundaries. I would suggest putting your mom and dad in a \u201ctime out.\u201d Yes both of them, they are a couple they get to be treated as one. \nThe point of \u201c time out\u201d is that you and your wife has zero contact with your parents. None, they don\u2019t call to bother or stop by. They get to sit over in their area being quite, because your mom did a bad thing. This allows you and your wife have a set amount of time ( at least 3 weeks) so you two can come up with boundaries that you want away from your mom.  I say 3 weeks because the first week or so there is a chance your mom is not going to behave well. This will help be an indicator on how Strong your boundaries need to be. Expect calls, from not only your mom but other family members as well. All with the intent on trying to shame/ guilt you back into line. DO NOT fall for it, stand strong for your family.\n\nIf you ever need support or a place to vent r/JUSTNOMIL is a sub for people with difficult moms as well as Mother in laws.",
            "Good luck with this one!  I feel so sorry for your wife.  I did not have a narcissistic mother but I did have a narcissistic sister.  At one of her grandchildren's birthday parties she showed up with a clipboard and expected all the mom's to sign some petition she was passing around.  And we could go on...\n\nIt would be appropriate to talk to your dad about it, but don't be too surprised if he can't take your side of the story.  He has been putting up with your mother for a long time.  His attitude may be, \"Oh that's just how she is.\"",
            "Are you afraid of your mom?  If not why do you want to talk to your dad first?\n\nYour mother needs to know she can\u2019t treat you or your  wife badly.  \n\nI think you are in the wrong sub \u2014 you should be over at justnomil.\n\nIt is your job to protect your wife and your kids FROM your mom.

            "Jesus tell your mom she has been uninvited from the babyshower. It is a perfect way to start new boundaries. It is not that hard to move it to another location Even if invites are out. \n\nIf you just talk to your mom she will either see that actions dont have consequences and/or ruin the babyshower.",
            "Seriously OP, cancel the shower. Contact anyone who's been invited and let them know that it's not a good time for a shower. I'd mention how your mom is the cause because she's sure to try to spin it and blame you guys and you don't need flying monkeys coming after you. It's up to you if you want to give your dad a head's up or tell them together (would he back you up if you gave him advanced warning?) But tell your mom that you're canceling the party because of her actions and if she doesn't treat you guys, especially your wife, better, then she'll be lucky to even meet her grandchild. \n\nIf she plans on going through with the party, I like how someone else suggested throwing your own shower at a different location on the same day/time and tell people there's been a change of location and if they want to celebrate with you and your wife, they can come there. Still, let people know your mom has overstepped so she can't spin her own tale.",
            "No. You can tell your dad after the fact. If you mom is in her 50s and still acting this way, clearly your dad either isn't trying or isn't able to restrain her.  It's OK to set boundaries with your mom and it shouldn't be delayed.\n\n If you want to make it clear to dad afterwards that you aren't trying to restrict his access, that is fine, but keep in mind he may decide to exhibit enabling behavior.",

            "First, congratulations to you and your wife on your baby! \n\nHonestly, I would cancel the baby shower. Seriously. It doesn't matter if invitations have been sent. You can let everyone invited know that you're sorry, but it's cancelled.\n\nThat is, of course, if this is what your wife wants. I don't think she should have to be subjected to a shower under these conditions that your mom has created, but it's her choice. Good for you for deciding to set more boundaries with your mom.\n\nIf she agrees, then YOU tell your mom that you/your wife won't be there and that it's cancelled. If your mom insists that it's not cancelled, stay firm that you/your wife will not be there. Period. If your mom doesn't need ANY input from your wife, then she doesn't need your WIFE there. Take this opportunity to be explicit about your boundaries. And stick to it.\n\nYou let everyone know by mail that it's officially cancelled. Don't count on your mom to do it.\n\nThen, a friend of your wife can host a baby shower later - before or after the baby is born. \n\nBest wishes!",

            "This is where you walk the fine line of being kind and enabling bad behavior. I understand your desire to involve your dad, but your concern should be for *your* family unit. Set boundaries and enforce them; this is a good opportunity to do so. Sit down with your parents together and explain 1. what's changing and 2. what the consequences are for crossing the boundaries. You don't even have to get into why or past behaviors, and in fact, doing so would give your mother the chance to deflect her behavior. Regardless of how you handle this, be aware that your mom could have a very adverse reaction and take it out on your wife.",
            "A heads up to your father isn't a bad idea. But that's what it is, a heads up. A courtesy to him. YOU still need to have that conversation with your mother. Drawing lines in the sand, setting boundaries, ultimatum, whatever you decide to call it, you need to do it. Do it for your wife, for your relationship, and tbh for you. \n\nAlso, talk to your wife. Now especially, she needs to know that pissed you off. That you are not going to let that happen to her again. Wife might try to talk you down or back you off; it's really not a big deal, it doesn't matter, pregnancy hormones has me feeling it was a bigger deal than it was. Validate that within your own feelings; maybe it wasn't so bad in the big scheme of things but I'm not going to let anyone speak to my wife and mother of my children in such a way. \n\nI'll say from my own experience it won't get any better until you take a hard line with Mom. It'll suck for a while, it'll hurt for a while, you'll feel guilty for a while. But that's part of it. And you can still sneak granddad by every so often.",
            "Definitely narcissistic. The baby shower isnt about her, prioritize your wife and baby, shes probably already stressed about giving birth. Cancel it if your wife is not comfortable with it, throw one on your own terms.",
            "I\u2019m not sure I would tell her she can\u2019t see the baby. That will escalate the argument really quickly.

I will not accept my wife being treated that way and would appreciate if you would apologize to her.\u201d\n\nIf she balks at that, that\u2019s when I would start setting up the boundary of not seeing the baby.",

            "By still letting her have the baby shower you\u2019re telling her that her behavior is acceptable and that you\u2019ll tolerate it.

You can still talk to your dad and arrange for him to come over. You really should\u2019ve put your foot down right when she said it\u2026I know it caught you off guard but not saying anything just further deludes her into thinking her behavior is fine.

You cancel it or have your own and do not show up at the one your mom planned. \n\nFirst off, your mom knew what she was doing with that comment. To continue to have a baby shower with your mom or to even have your mom at the shower LETS HER WIN and thinks she could continue to do this. Second, this is a party to honor and love your wife and baby. It should 100% be your wife's decision on what food, decorations, style, location, and guest. If your mom says otherwise she is lying to you and trying to gaslight you guys. \n\nThis is where you start the boundary. You move the baby shower to a new location. Let guest know. Then YOU call your mom and say \"mom. That behavior was uncalled for and rude. This baby shower is for wife and her request and opinions matter for this event. Because of your behavior you are no longer throwing a shower for us and we will not be attending any shower you are involved in\". \n\nHere is the thing. Your mom will \"melt down\" over this. It may look a different depending on what she thinks she can get away with. Because she knows that if she puts out a big enough fit then you will bow down. And it's time to show her that she cannot control you or manipulate you.\n\nBecause that's what she is doing. Harsh words and abrasive comments are used to make you back down. Tears, anger, threats are also tactics used to make you change your mind. \n\nBe prepared for:\n1. \"How could you do this to me! I'm your mother! I've done so much for you and just want to do this one thing for you\" - this is guilt. \n2. \"Fine! I'll never do anything for you ever again!\" - guilt/and threat\n3. \"I guess I'm just such a bad mother\" - guilt\n4. \"If you do this to me I'll never do anything for you ever again\" - threat\n5. \"I just wanted her to be grateful! I'm spending so much money and can't afford the extras she wants\" - this is a \"im not worng\" manipulation tactic. If she couldn't afford it, a normal response would have been \"I've spent a lot on this already. I might not can make that work, but I'll see what I can do\". So do not allow your boundaries to drop with this statement. \n6. \"If you do this, I'll never help with the kid\". -threat. And she is lying. Women can't stay away from babies. \n7. Or just be prepared for her to turn this around on your wife with \"I didn't say that. She misunderstood me. What I meant was.....\" - don't fall for that. Thats the classic narcissist phrase move. She is trying to damage control. \n\n\nAlso think of how to respond to all these statements. Maybe another redditor can help. \n\nBut whatever you do, don't go to that shower.",

I understand where you may be surprised at how she could act like this over something so sensitive and meaningful, but it\u2019s who she is. I feel as though you should stand up for your wife regardless of your father\u2019s input. Talk to her alone, and lay it down for her. Tell her straight out if she wants to be involved, she WILL learn how to hold her tongue.

            "This reminds me of when my two dear friends offered to throw me a baby shower. They invited my MIL to help because they thought it would be a nice gesture for her to be included. I spent time going table to table, chatting with guests, playing baby shower games, opening gifts, eating, etc. I didn't have my phone out and I did not take any photos, one of my friends offered to be in charge of that. \n\nA few days after the shower, I get a scathing phone call and accused of not appreciating my MIL and all the money she spent because I didn't include her in the pictures on Facebook...pictures I didn't take... in a post I didn't make... 36 weeks pregnant, sobbing hysterically... I had no clue (still don't) how it was my fault or only my responsibility to ensure I took a picture with her so that HER friends and family could see on Facebook all that she did for me... \n\nShe's going to hold this over your wife forever. \"I did all of this for you and this is how you thank me\". She's not doing it out of the kindness in her heart or love for your wife and her future grandchild. She is doing it for the recognition she feels she's deserving of for doing it. Just like my MIL. \n\nI highly suggest you take her off as the host. You said you can't cancel because people from out of town have already been invited. There's still time to change the plans since the event hasn't happened yet. You won't regret a last minute change. Trust me. If I could go back and do my baby shower over, I would insist my friends not invite my MIL to help.",
            "OP, you're the first post I find in which the SPOUSE PROBLEM is actually asking a question. You mon was aggressive towards your wife WHO IS PREGNANT. Your mom has always been like this and your dad has enabled her for decades already. I don't think you will accomplish much by speaking to him. So go to her BY YOURSELF and lay down the law now. You have a baby on the way, grow that spine already. And cancel the shower. Your mom does not deserve to show off in front of family and friends at your and your wife's expense.",
            "I think this needs to be a family meeting.\n\nOn a side note: is your mother the attention-seeking type? It seems to me like she's throwing the party more for herself than your wife. Surely your wife (the mother-to-be) is the focus of the party? If she was craving onion and banana pizza, then get the lady what she wants. It's for her, after all.",
            "So your mother was publicly nasty to your wife and you just stood there? It wouldn't have felt good to be unnecessarily snapped at like that with nobody to stand up for her. \n\nYou know what your mother is like. You might be used to that \"unkindness\" since you grew up with it. Your dad probably enabled it, since it's easier to not rock the boat with narcissists. I doubt your wife is used to it and neither should she be expected to. Your wife is now your priority. Not your mother's or father's feelings.\n\nPeople are supposed to deal with their own parents. So if your wife's parent was unreasonably rude and aggressive to you, it's your wife's responsibility to shut that down. So it was your job in this case and you failed. If it happens again, call her out on it right there and then. Make a public showing of you standing with your wife and not standing for her being disrespected.\n\nIt may just have been stress that your mother reacted inappropriately to and will apologize. Hopefully. But if she refuses to see it that way or denies she was inappropriate, you might have a problem when baby comes. Prioritize your wife always.",

Found out she is hooked on Oxys and already is diabetic and has had surgeries. \n Has always caused friction due to her inability to just keep her unkind comments to herself. Took my xgf to visit my Mom which is 6 hrs away for Thanksgiving. X offered to help cut up potatos. she did but mom commented. \"who cut these?! theyre too small!!\" X was flabbergasted that she would ask who when she stood beside her amd watched her cut them. 10 years later ive moved back to help her pack and she still makes those kind of comments. \n Was at my Grandmothers feast and the sacred fire was burning and i was sitting with relatives i hadnt even met yet and my mom loudly says. \"i cant sit near the fire the smoke bothers my asthma!!\" I was kinda embaressed and wondered why she had to proclaim so loudly her dislike of the smoke especially when it must burn for 10 days and its sacred. After being around my mom for a month i realize she is really fucked up and i know its because of those damn pills. She arguementive and passive agressive. She wont wear her hearing aid and i must yell to talk to her, she used to get mad me when i was little because i didnt speak loud enough, could be because she liked smacking me n the ear when she was driving. When she didnt hear she stills give me a diry look and says \"huh??!\" \nShe did things to my brother and me that would shock you.

So im thinking its pills and dementia. These posts on FB keep popping up in my feed not to make our elderly parents feel guilty about the past but fuck its really starting to irritate me that im 45 and my mom 65 is a complete narcissist and has BPD. Im losing interest in takjng care of her now because of the oxy addiction and up and down behaviour.

            "Baby showers and wedding-related stuff have gotten ridiculously complicated over the last thirty years. \n\nA baby shower used to be a bit of crepe paper and a cake. There was no such thing as a bachelorette. A wedding shower was a bit of food but no decorations. \n\nIf a person hosts an event I'd say they get to choose what the food and decorations will be. Your wife was wrong to bring up her Instagram fantasies of a shower because your mother probably did not sign up for that. She may think that it's pushy and a complicated shower is not what she had in mind.\n\nIn strict etiquette a relative is not allowed to throw a shower because that's like begging for gifts. All those people telling you to have your own shower are completely out of line. \n\nYou can use the etiquette rule to shift it to a friend's house. There's also nothing wrong with multiple showers with different friend or relative groups.\n\nDo not escalate the situation.",

            "I would simply set your boundary with your mom to them both at the same time. The fact is, you are setting these boundaries with your mom, not your dad. He hasn't done anything wrong and frankly, it sounds like being married to her is punishment enough. So instead of doing the whole sorry, you won't get to see your grandkid cause of her - you can simply say - dad, these boundaries don't apply to you if you want to visit on your own. That leaves the ball in his court to decide if he wants to foster an independent relationship with your family or if he's going to stick by his wife's side on this. He's grown, let him figure that out himself.\n\nAs for your fears about your mom's potential retaliation/outburst. Remember this: it takes two to tango. She can't flip out on you if you don't give her the access to do so. \n\nYou can state your boundary verbally and if she starts flipping out, leave immediately. If you didn't get out all the words you wanted to before she went apeshit, send the rest of your declaration via text message. You can also set a boundary with her that you will not be responding to any communication that is aggressive or rude. She needs to communicate in a calm and considerate manner if she wants to get a response. End of story. So this way, you're not cutting her off, you're just setting strict rules about how she gets access to you.\n\nThere's a psychologist on YouTube called Dr. Ramani who does a series on narcissists. One of the things she refers to is called the narcissist's supply. Narcissists gravitate towards people who give them that attention and time of day to act out upon. If someone doesn't provide that \"supply,\" they eventually lose interest as it's not giving them the attention (positive or negative) that they so desperately seek. If you learn to just walk away, put her number notifications on mute, and only selectively reply to things that meet your standard of healthy and respectful communication, you take all the power back. I highly recommend it.\n\nHeck, if she comes banging on your door. You can slip a piece of paper out that states she needs to leave now as she has violated the healthy communication clause and try another time. Also, let her know if she doesn't leave immediately, the police will be called and she will be forcefully escorted off the property. You need a show of force here.",

            "I have been recommending this book to anyone who will listen, as it helped me more than therapy (but I think everyone can benefit from good therapy). Please look up \u201cadult children of emotionally immature parents\u201d by Lindsay Gibson, PsyD. \n\nMy mom and dad fulfill very similar roles as your parents. Overbearing and quick-to-anger mother and \u201ceasy-going\u201d, loving father (you didn\u2019t go into detail on your dad, but I am guessing he is similar to my dad). \n\nThe book goes into details about why your parents act the way they do, and the best way for you to react to meet your own emotional needs and set boundaries. The short version is, it\u2019s best to distance yourself from your parents and know that they are not going to change who they are because they cannot see any problem with their behavior. You can tell your mom what bothered you and how you feel, but know that she probably won\u2019t accept any responsibility for her behavior. \n\nOne more note. As I said earlier, you didn\u2019t go into much detail on your dad, but you might consider your father\u2019s role in your mom\u2019s behavior. Did your dad ever stick up for you when your mom had narcissistic tendencies and unhealthy behavior towards you? Your dad may not have had an active role in your mom\u2019s behavior, but he probably didn\u2019t try to protect you from it, and that\u2019s also not ok. \n\nI agree with other comments on here that you don\u2019t need to talk to your dad before talking to your mom (whenever I do this, my dad defends my mom\u2019s behavior). I just wanted to point out that your dad may have a role in this family dynamic too. For me personally, that was a pretty eye-opening realization.",
            "Tbh I'd explain how inappropriate that was and I'd ghost her. From somebody with a narcissistic mom that has ruined almost every relationship I have ever had on top of not taking my side when I needed her to...I'd just cut the chord and explain to your child that grandma is not nice to mommy.\nI'm struggling to decide if I want to dive back into my family by going to my sister's wedding. \nJust know that whatever choice YOU make it will be the right one for YOU.\nLove and hugs from one abuse survivor to another.",

            "Don't mention the withholding grandchild thing. If this becomes a clear repeat behavior then yes you might consider that if it feels unhealthy for the child to be around, but we don't hold our kids over their grandparents and try to control other adults by threatening that they never get to see the kids. That's not healthy for the kids if grandparent is loving and kind  to grandkid. Never use the children as a way to control other people.\n\nI think you need to talk to your mom. Don't threaten her with not seeing her grandkid. Tell her that if she ever is rude to your wife again that she won't see you. \n\nYou can go no contact if the respect is not there. Leave the kids out if it completely. Your wife is your choice and disrespecting your wife is disrespecting you. She needs to understand that. \n\nYou did the right thing waiting until you can privately speak to your mom. If anything is going on that caused her to snap like that it can be revealed in a private conversation with you. You should talk to your mom privately and ask her why she said that and tell her that was super offensive to you. Keep your wife out if it as much as possible because your mom will blame it all on your wife, you coming to speak to her, she won't deal with it, unless it comes from you, unless it affects your relationship with your mom. Like my mother in law hates me but she won't address anything unless my husband is upset. My husband is her baby, so she doesn't want that relationship to fall apart, she could care less about my relationship with her.  So sit down with your mom and ask her, have lunch together, just ask her why she said that. Tell her it hurts you because this is the family you are creating and your role is to protect that family that you love her but you need her to be nice so the baby feels love and good things only and your wife feels safe. The thing is when people snap like that and say things out if character, it could be something totally unrelated. Your mom might be having a medical scare or something and not thinking right. I don't mean to worry you, but if it's out of character, that happens when moms get distracted with something totally unrelated and are worried or super upset but hiding it. Like my mom was also having severe hormonal issues with menopause and stared saying super rude things and having no patience, it was a hormone imbalance.",

            "Since you didn't react then and there, I would go to your mom and say you were so upset with the way she SNAPPED at your wife for offering an idea, that you needed time to calm down. Now that you have... then say what needs to be said. This will quelch any comments about you not speaking up about it then. Do your parents pop over now unannounced? If not, no need to say anything until they do it the first time.

When I moved out I started to distance myself from her, and she kept getting quite aggressive about my new distance, snapping, being rude etc.\n\nI would say go straight to her, and tell her that if she wants to be a part of your child's life she has to tone it down, act like a grown person, and understand that your world doesn't revolve around her. If she can't handle that, thats her decision.\n\nThe biggest lesson you learn in life is that if someone makes you unhappy, either directly or indirectly, it is perfectly fine to start cutting them off, no matter their relationship with you. If you really matter to her, she will change how she acts, maybe not straight away, but in time the realisation will hit. Be hard nosed about it now, tell her how you feel to her face, and if she's capable of growing as a person, she will in time.\n\nBelieve me, its her loss if she can't behave.

        "selftext": "I am beyond frustrated right now and am on the verge of giving my fianc\u00e9, Alan (39M) an ultimatum that I really don't want to give.\n\nAlan and I have been dating for about 3 years and have been engaged for a year, with our wedding date in a week. He told me on our first date he was a package deal; his daughter, Rose, is his whole world. I was perfectly okay with it and we started hanging out together. Alan's ex, Carrie (38F) is still in the picture as she and Alan are coparenting. Carrie doesn't like me one bit. Alan told me that he and Carrie had been high school/college sweethearts and she had always held onto hope that he'd come back to her. But Alan also confided in me that Carrie wasn't a great partner. She adores Rose. But she treated Alan badly during their entire relationship. You name it, she did it; emotional abuse, gaslighting, financial abuse, belittling, etc. He finally got the courage to walk away from her when he discovered she was having an affair. Rose was maybe 6 when Alan learned about the affair. Unfortunately, the courts still granted Carrie 50/50 custody, despite the amount of evidence against her.\n\nRose and I have had a bit of a strained relationship. I understand it, having grown up in a divorced home that both parents remarried. She's a preteen and has some conflicted thoughts about her dad marrying a new woman instead of going back to her mother. But she's been really haughty and nasty to me. She makes cutting comments and will respond with \"You're not my mother\" when I ask her to stop. Alan has tried to set down ground rules but she flippantly tells him that \"OP's not going to last.\" I put up with it because I love Alan and, sometimes, Rose behaves herself.\n\nSeriously, she's not a horrible kid. She gets good grades in school, she's in the youth symphony and takes dance classes. She's really popular, bubbly and friendly when she isn't being mean to me. It's like Jekyll and Hyde. Alan and I have talked about it constantly and have even involved Carrie but Carrie just brushes it off, telling me to mind my own beeswax. We have tried therapy, groundings and everything else but nothing works.\n\nThat brings us to tonight. A couple of weeks ago, alternations on my wedding dress was finished. I was really excited. My late grandma (who I was really close to) made her own wedding dress after seeing photos of Grace Kelly and many women in our family have worn it to their weddings or have had their own dresses designed after it. As I'm taller than my grandma, I had mine made. It's really special to me. I have the dress saved in my closet, tucked in a garment bag.\n\nAlan and I don't live together. However, my apartment is close to one of Rose's friends so we have an arrangement that on some days Alan has custody, Rose will hang out at her friend's house and then come over for dinner with Alan and me. After we watch a movie or play Nintendo Switch, Alan will take Rose to his place. Today was one of those days. Alan was running late from work and called to let me know. Rose arrived and everything was normal. I stepped into the kitchen to finish preparing dinner, leaving Rose alone.\n\nIf I had any inkling of what was about to happen, I would've done something different.\n\nDinner was ready and I went to get Rose. I passed my bedroom door and something about the way the sliding closet door was positioned made me want to check.\n\nMy dress had been cut to pieces with a pair of scissors and was covered with glitter paint.  My veil is torn to shreds. It's completely ruined.\n\nI broke down crying. I was too upset to even be angry. Alan arrived and found me in a mess. He was beyond furious and went to Rose, confronting her about it. Rose admitted it with a shrug of her shoulders and said \"What's the point? She's just a fat old cow anyway.\" Alan confiscated her cell phone and immediately called Carrie to discuss a punishment.\n\nI don't know how or why, but this is the straw that is breaking the camel's back. I have gone through so much with Rose. I've tried to be caring and compassionate...and this is my reward?\n\nNow that my sadness has faded away, it's been replaced with a boiling anger. I'm tempted to just call off the wedding and leave Alan to deal with his brat of a daughter. This wasn't an accident. This was on purpose. But then I remember that Rose is part of Alan's life.\n\nI love Alan. But I don't know if I can keep taking it.\n\nWhat do I do now?\n\nTLDR: My future stepdaughter destroyed my wedding dress and veil a week before my wedding and I'm torn between just straight up abandoning him or giving his daughter yet another chance.",

            "Your relationship with her is a part of the marriage. I wouldn't get married if that isn't right. It'd be just as ridiculous as marrying him when your relationship with him isn't right.",
            "Is this the future you want. Think about it thoroughly. It's gonna be a tough road ahead and I think you should prioritise yourself and your mental health.",
            "My great uncle married a woman who had a daughter like this! \n\n\nShe was apparently a nasty little shit who put sugar in his gas tank, would play jacks near the back tires of his vehicle so he'd run them over, puncturing the tires, bury his tools, taking his clothes off the line when they were drying and throwing them in the lot next door which was basically a mud pit when it rained. The last straw was when she snuck little rocks she found outside in his soup. It was like pozole or menudo or something he couldn't see through the broth and was semi-hardy. He swallowed a couple of rocks and had to go to the hospital, but he was done. They'd tried everything with her, and her mom even tore up her behind, but he wasn't having it and divorced her. \n\nMy family would talk about that A LOT when we all got together. Apparently, the bio dad was a \"going out for cigarettes\" and never came back kinda dad. The girl was young but old enough to remember him, and I don't know, maybe hoped he'd come back. And this was the 50s, so there wasn't therapy or anything, to really deal with it, maybe a lobotomy which we all know is \ud83e\udee3. But I always felt bad for the mom because she was struggling before she met my uncle, and he took care of her and the girl, not rich but comfortable and safe and they had to go back to struggling and I think moving away to be with family after the divorce. \n\n\nAll I can say is I can't imagine what would happen if Rose found out you were pregnant. How miserable you'd be your entire pregnancy, a time that's supposed to be super happy, how scared you'd be to leave the baby alone around her, how badly she'd treat your child. Carrie would pitch a fit at not being the only woman who has his kid and who knows what she'd instruct Rose to do. I wouldn't want to find out. \n\n\nIt's just something to think about. Put yourself and your happiness first here because he's always going to put his kid first as he should. She needs major therapy, and he needs to focus his time on getting her help and away from her mom.",
            "I have been in a similar position, but I ran after 1,5 years because no man is worth my peace. In hindsight the best decision ever. \n\nMy current fiance has an almost 18 yo and he actually parents her. This makes all the difference. \n\nDon\u2019t do this to yourself, you\u2019re worth so much more. \n\nSend Alan and Carrie the bill and never speak to them again after that.",
            "As someone who has watched my sister deal with stepchildren like this for over 20 years - it never gets better. \n\nThey will continue to try and hurt you and break up your relationship forever.\n\nYou can either accept this and live with the abuse, or give them what they want and leave their father.\n\nMy sister stayed and she has never been 100% happy, because they are always in the background and their father always lets them get away with bullshit behaviour because he doesn\u2019t want them to cut him out of their lives.",
            "When you call it off, you need to share what she did. It can\u2019t be you guys called it quits cause you don\u2019t love eachother. She\u2019s old enough to know better and people can know what she did. \n\nIf it was my daughter and she did that to anyone else even if it\u2019s someone I didn\u2019t like - she would get every right taken away because that is disgusting behavior. And I am sensitive to how she feels because I also have divorced parents who dated others but I never thought to do something like this.",
            "Call it off and sent Rose's Dad a bill for the dress. Don't get married, Rose wins but it'll be much healthier for you in the long run.",
            "You walk away. \n\nIf after 3 years this is still at this level and getting worse, it will not change. \n\nThere is no ultimatum you can give. He is a father, and he will always choose his child like he should. The fact that he has done nothing to set hard boundaries. Therapy only works if the child is willing. Grounding doesn't do anything when mom will not back him. You can say he has tried everything but when she cut up your dress he took her phone. Nothing else. I am sorry, but he isn't going to change. Nothing will change. \n\nUnless she either has her mom cut off or he takes a harsh route, then it won't, and her mom is good enough even though she is encouraging this behavior. So she will remain in her life. He won't take a harsh route because what good is that if mom won't back him or kiddo decides she doesn't want to visit because of it. \n\nIn the end, he will always choose his child. You can suck it up and let him and yourself accept her abusing you. Letting it escalate until possibly her becoming physical. And what about if you have kids. Do you trust your child is safe growing up in this environment. Or you walk away. You can love someone, but love is not always enough, and hunny, I don't see anything changing if after years she is only getting worse. \n\nSo it's up to you to decide. Stay and your life 50 percent of the time is being abused. Or walk away and find a relationship where you are not abused by someone in their life. \n\nYes, she is a child. Yes, she is most likely being pushed to these things. Lied to that dad would be better alone. That if he is, he might get back with mom. She is being manipulated and striking out. You can feel for her while saying no, I will not put up with this. She is old enough to know she is doing wrong. She just won't stop until something drastic stops her.",
            "I would run OP. You have to acknowledge that this will be your life and won\u2019t stop.",
            "YEP!!! \n\n**TELL ALAN IT'S OVER AND DUMP THE FUCKING LOT OF THEM**.\n\n**AND BILL THEM FOR THE DRESS**.",
            "Call it off. This is the tip of the iceberg of what she'll destroy. What if you and Alan have children? Do you trust her not to hurt the baby? Ooh, he took her cell phone. There were a million ways she could still entertain herself or turn herself into the victim and get her dad or at the very least her mom on her side.",
            "Rose is a product of her upbringing. Obviously, Carrie has likely done more than a bit of talking to Rose about treating you badly, but Alan isn't an innocent man here, either. \n\nTherapy, grounding and anything else will not work because Carrie is likely praising Rose or making promises to her about her dad coming back once you are out of the picture. And Rose has a mission: Making you \"not last\" - she said so herself. \n\nAnd why should she stop trying? Mom is praising her and likely waiving any punishment the moment Rose is with her, things like getting grounded or therapy are also not exactly the most debilitating things when to Rose, the breakup of you and Alan is a lot more important.\n\nConfiscating her phone for ruining a whole wedding dress? That's hardly a big reaction. A more fitting reaction would be that Rose isn't allowed in your house anymore. My instinct says that she should also symbolically pay with her allowance for parts of the dress for some time, but her mother will likely just give her the money when Alan isn't looking.\n\nI think the biggest punishment would be if Alan would finally set some boundaries with Carrie, mainly. Like, the punishment doesn't have to be discussed with *Carrie* first, but with *you*. *You* are supposed to be his new family, after all. Coparenting doesn't mean that every single decision has to be checked with the other parent. \n\nAs long as Alan doesn't see that Carrie is the main issue , nothing will change. She will keep indoctrinating Rose.",

            "Nope,no no NO. OP, you have to end this once and for all. You are never going to have peace with a stepdaughter and also an ex like that. \n\nWhat if you and him have kids, would you feel safe having the baby around the stepdaughter? \n\nYou've done your best and you've gotten nowhere, sometimes you have to know when to quit and I think that moment has come.",
            "It's been 3 years and Alan is still allowing Rose to be disrespectful towards you. Whether it takes therapy, better communication or whatnot, he hasn't done his part. You can't blame Rose for the crap life she's having due to both her parents' bad choices and having to split her life between 2 households.\n\nI'd walk away from this one. Alan may be a good boyfriend/husband. But he is a lousy father.",

            "If she can take a scissors to your wedding dress, she can take a scissors to  YOU.,\n\nThat girl has some rage inside of her.\n\nBefore you break up with Alan, INSIST he pay for the ruined dress. Keep the ruined dress. Make sure you have a text message trail that has him mentioning Rose destroyed your dress. \n\nOnce money is in hand, end the relationship.,",
            "Her response after being caught is concerning. You deserve someone without that kind of issue tbh. She is old enough to understand what's right from wrong. I'd suggest cutting it now and if you paid for the dress let him pay you back for it.",
            "If you not 100% sure you want to be married,  then you shouldn't be married.   Although Rose is the one who did the damage, some part of you probably blames Alan for the way she is.  Do you want to feel this way forever?",

            "> Unfortunately, the courts still granted Carrie 50/50 custody, despite the amount of evidence against her.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm going to focus on this bit because I think it's representative of this whole thing. You're feeling threatened by a child, and you don't really seem care for this child all that much (I mean describing her redeeming qualities you mention her attending dance classes, FFS). You think it's a good idea to take the child from the mother because she was a bad partner. This is next-level egotistical thinking.\n\n\nAnyways. You mention wanting to give Alan an ultimatum. An ultimatum about **what**, exactly? Not only did you know about this child's existence since the very beginning. But he was very, very clear that they were a package deal.\n\n\nListen, adolescents are hard, especially those that come from a divorced household where parents can't set aside their differences to coparent like adults. For all that he likes to play the victim, he's as much to blame as she is (and just for the future, remember that an adult doesn't get to play the woe is me card when they decided to have a child with someone they consider to be unfit to be parents).\n\n\nIn that sense, it seems to me he's kinda repeating a pattern here. Not only because he chose a woman who can't exhibit the slightest regard for a teenager raised in a crazy home, but because I can't for the life of me understand what the rush to get remarried is. I would ask you, but I'm afraid the answer would be \"so we can bring more children into this crazy situation while the first one is clearly suffering greatly\".\n\n\nAbsolute self-centeredness all-around, by all parties involved.\n\n\nOne final note: when you \"take a teen to a psychologist\" your aim shouldn't be to \"fix the situation\" (the behaviour), but rather to give them a dpace where they can sort their shit out and have a chance of being something resembling happy. My partner is a child psychiatrist, and people like you and your fianc\u00e9 are the bane of her existence.\u00a0\n\n\nTake a step back and reconsider everything I just said, even though you don't like it. This story isn't about you, a fully-grown adult who got a material possession destroyed. It's about a preteen who seemingly has **no** reasonable adults around to worry about her.\n\n\n...do you think enrolling her into yet another sport/hobby/lesson/thing-to-get-her-out-of-everyone's-hair will solve the thing?",

            "Your fiance is not kidding when he says they're a package deal. This is not a good situation for you. The daughter clearly has something to work through, and the fiance doesn't seem to have made it clear to his ex that the relationship is as dead as disco. It seems to me like the ex and daughter have planned some stupid parent trap ripoff that isn't going to end like they're hoping. Or maybe it will since #MeredithWasRight. You're just another beautiful woman that's being treated like shit by an ungrateful child that believes she knows what's best for her parents. But, regarding punishment, there isn't much your fiance can do to get the daughter on board with you being in their life. I hate to say it, but he might not be ready for a relationship yet. \n\n\n\nNTA if you stay and try.

            "Dd the daughter ever get therapy for dealing with her patient's divorce? Honestly do you want to live with this girl for the next decade? She sounds horrible. I know she's a hurt kid lashing out because she's angry and confused and sad but she's out of control and needs therapy and things are probably not going to get much better. They've been separated linger than they were together with her. She needs to get over it a little. It's not like you were the woman who split her parents up.",
            "She is a child, and her mother is, by your telling, abusive and playing her against you. The child is not the problem here. Her actions are mean and spiteful, but they are not the actions of a happy child but one who is feeling immense pressure to \u201cavenge\u201d her mother after being inappropriately involved in her parents\u2019 relationship.\n\nI know you said you\u2019ve tried therapy. Try again. Individual therapy for all three of you AND couples therapy for you and Alan AND family therapy for everyone (maybe even Carrie, although she may refuse to participate).",
            "This is a package deal that will only get worse over time.  Think about what she will do when you both live together, will you have the resolve to tell your husband she can't be over, or face the sadness and loss with your husband when she has to be over way less or resentment even?  I think you know what has and should be done, this kid will only escalate after marriage unfortunately.",
            "They're a package deal, as he told you from the start. Unfortunately half that package is a toxic monster of a kid, probably being egged on by her even worse mother, but also enabled by her father. The best thing you can do is get away.",
            "Call it off. It will tell her she can be horrible and get her way, but life is too short for this headache. If you have ANY interest in having children it will be an issue. Hell hath no fury like a preteen whose parents aren\u2019t able to see the damage they are causing their own child.",
            "Are you willing to be tormented by a child that hates you for no reason that you can\u2019t punish or discipline them for horrible acts of defiance for the rest of your life for a man who is willing to allow it because it\u2019s his child ?? You\u2019ll always be 2nd in his life you might aswell cut your losses and leave.",
            "Imagine if you have kids. If she'll do this to a dress imagine the shit she'll do to your baby.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's over op, sorry but save yourself from a life time of misery.",
            "Show up to the wedding in that dress.",
            "Have he and his daughter participated in family therapy? Is the child still receiving individual therapy? she should be. She is obviously miserable. That\u2019s a lot of rage. She doesn\u2019t care at the moment that her father could be happier if he were married to you. She is mostly afraid of losing what she has, and that\u2019s obviously been promoted and encouraged by the ex who was an abusive partner. She probably deals with the same crap that made your boyfriend leave, but she can\u2019t leave. He\u2019s got lots of parenting to do before creating a new step family with her. and that is not about grounding. He should be participating in parent training and family therapy. Trauma informed. There\u2019s no ultimatum to give? Y\u2019all can postpone or call off the wedding. Or marry (and maybe keep your apartment) and keep working on the relationships.",
            "Cut your losses.  This situation is not worth it.  You do not want to squander your remaining youth on this.  I pity the girl, but her character is not going to change. And her mother is a nightmare.",
            "Looks like Rose has some.big feelings that she needs to talk about and be understood. \n\nYou are allowed to love and be loved and yes this behavior is wrong but at the same time she is clearly going through it.",
            "Id leave. He didn't do shit to prove he can manage his kid, you have a crazy ex in the picture stirring drama and this spineless jellyfish man comes with a horrible stepdaughter that's going to make your life hell.\n\n\nIf you really want to stay, don't see why but whatever, just tell him you aren't interested in a relationship with his kid and that you either keep separate lives until she's gone to college, only seeing him when he's 50% free from this brat, or you are done.\u00a0\n\n\nMost likely he will claim what she did wasn't that bad and you'll realize the girl won. Then you'll lose all respect for the guy who puts you last and walk away anyhow.\u00a0",
            "Children need to learn there are consequences for what they do. It's a crucial part of growing up.\n\n\n'Rose, we are taking money out of the savings account where we've been saving money for your future, in order to pay for this.'\n\n\nThere needs to be a consequence that affects her, or she won't learn anything.",
            "Please follow these steps:\n- sit down with Alan and discuss thororughly your relationship with him: do you love each other, is he ready to protect you and side with you in the future, what are the actions he want to pursue with regards to the incident with the daughter and with the ex wife... from your post, it seems he is a good guy who wants to do things properly. And love sometimes goes beyond the wedding dress. Keep in mind that he didn't do anything. His daughter did it, and he was definitely not pleased with it.\n- IF, AND ONLY IF you see in him the man you want, meaning that he loves you to pieces and he is really the loving and caring man you saw before the incident, then go buy another dress and marry him. This would be the real strong reply to the ex-wife and her manipulated daughter... and the dress is an accessory to the ceremony. It is true that it hurts, but it is just a dress.\n- once married, put down your boundaries (you and your husband) and decide the new course of act. De facto, this is an offence done by a 12 years old that refuses to see her father marrying another woman...but if your husband can demonstrate the manipulation of the ex-wife on the kid, then this is material for the court.\nIf you call off the wedding now, they will say they are right that you are not a good person. You break up with Alan because of an incompatibility with him, not with his daughter.",
            "One possible way I can think of to help the situation if you want to stay with Alan is to ask him about reporting her to the police. If she recognizes that her actions have consequences her mother cant shield her from then you may finally see some behavioral adjustments.\u00a0",
            ">What do I do now?\n\nTotally up to you.  As Alan said, and he's right, \"package deal\".  You get the person, and for better and/or worse you get all that comes with it - family, friends, enemies, baggage, past relationship and exes, all their great qualities, all their flaws and imperfections.\n\nAnd, ... she's 12 ... kids are gonna do sh\\*t.  But yeah, even/especially for 12 that was pretty egregious.  You can accept it, process it, deal with it ... whatever ... or not, or reject it or whatever.  And, yep, you break up with Alan over what Rose did, that'll be sh\\*t for both Alan, *and* Rose ... but that becomes a \"not my problem\".  Actions have consequences ... even if it's actions of a 12 year old kid - I'm sure Rose is quickly learning that, if she's not already learned it.  Anyway, not tryin' to guilt trip you.  Rose did what she did.  All up to you on deciding what to do and/or not do.  So, ball's in your court.  And yeah, \"package deal\".  And relationships are personal ... can break up at any time, for any reason, or no reason at all.  All up to you.  So ... maybe break up.  Or maybe continue with the wedding plans on schedule ... or maybe postpone the wedding 'till Rose is an adult - then if she still causes any problems for/to you, she's then adult and can face adult consequences.  So ... you're call to make.  And ... maybe don't have to rush to decision ... but that may also depend on wedding and date thereof - if that's set, and depending how soon, may not have a whole lot of time to decide.\n\nGood luck!",
            "Walk down the aisle in normal clothes and when people ask, tell the truth.\n\nI think forgiving Rose would be the powerful and correct choice. She's 12, her family blew up and here you are.\n\nI think, be the adult in this situation, let it go and don't let a child dictate the lives of adults (ie. get married anyway).\n\nBut if you can't handle it, leave now. Rose may not change, and if you hate her, you won't be a good stepparent.",
            "This is an Alan problem. If he thinks taking her phone away is the equivalent in a punishment, then you need to just run away from him. He\u2019s a spineless shell of a man. \n\nThis girl should be feeling the effects and consequences of her actions on a permanent bases. Until rectified. \n\nBC I am eye for an eye kind of person, I would cut up her whole clothes. Photos. Dresses. There\u2019s absolutely no way she would not feel the equivalent loss and anger and frustration. Go out with a bang.",
            "Rose is 12. Rose thinks there will be zero consequences because her mom will just give her her phone back.\u00a0\n\n\nThe *only* thing that will get through is consequences that stick. No grace period. No time off for good behavior.\u00a0\n\n\n1 pair of shoes. 5 pairs pants, all black. 5 golf shirts. I'm sure her school sells them. Try the high school.\u00a0\n\n\nNo cell phone. Cut social activity.\u00a0\n\n\nIf she comes home in normal clothes, further steps need be taken. Boarding school, perhaps. Not one of those nice ones, either....\u00a0",
            "Raised several w no issues sorry I don\u2019t let children abuse ppl bc I\u2019m not spineless I hope you don\u2019t have any bc anyone who comes in contact with you or them has to worry about being hurt or harmed",
            "The comments are shocking\u2026 she\u2019s 12 and clearly going through a hard time accepting you. She didn\u2019t do the right thing of course but people are expecting her to act like an adult when she\u2019s just a kid. She\u2019s not ready for this and honestly that should have been something your fianc\u00e9 should have talked to his daughter about.\n\nYou\u2019ve only been in her life for 3yrs and probably less cause I doubt he introduced you to his kids the first year. She still sees you as an outsider. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be thinking about your \u201ccaring and compassion\u201d as something that needs to be rewarded by her. She\u2019s a kid.\n\nI would hold off on getting married for the sake of that poor little girl"
