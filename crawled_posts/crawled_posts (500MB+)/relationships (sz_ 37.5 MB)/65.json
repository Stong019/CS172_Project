        "selftext": "I dont want to go into a ton of detail. The \"need to know\" is I have been out of the home the last 7 years, and during this time my two siblings have lived there still. \nWhile I was in the home, we were mentally and physically abused by our stepfather.  We lived in trashy houses that were covered in actual garbage, including animal feces,  and just stuff EVERYWHERE. \nI havent heard from my youngest sister since May. I am pretty sure she has been told to cut contact with all of us (us being her older siblings). My second to youngest sister is overweight with spinal issues and is supposed to be dieting and seeing a specialist that they do not take her to see. \n\nI told the social worker that I wanted a check up on them because if previous deplorable conditions, and because I am not sure about any physical or mental abuse still happening in the home. It genuinely concerns me. I told them what happened with us (slammed into walls, things thrown at us, cussing, belittling our character... etc....) And told them repeatedly I really just want to know my little siblings dont have the same living conditions we had. \n\nMy husband supported me through the call, and agreed it was the right thing to do. My siblings all discussed it ahead of time with the exception of my eldest sister who moved out before things got bad and the two who live in the house. We all agreed it would at the very extreme least let them know that they were being watched and we didnt just give up on them... and maybe my Mother and SD would keep a clean house, clean nose etc..\n\nCPS contacted my mother very quickly.  Much faster than I anticipated. I mean within 3 hours.\nFollowing this my eldest sister who lives states away and hasnt contacted me in months calls and shes freaking out on me because she \"knows Im the one who called\". I denied nothing and simply said, \"If they have nothing to hide, then they dont need to worry. Itll be over and done with pretty quickly \" to which she replied \"And if it isnt? If theyre taken away?\" I said \"Hopefully it doesnt come to that, and if it does it isnt on me. I didnt maltreat them. I didnt spread animal feces through the house. If they are clearly neglecting them, why should they have to stay in the house?\" I asked \"Would you let your children live like we did?\" She didnt answer.  I asked again, and she said \"No. Id keep a decent house but its not your job to tell someone else how to parent\".  I said \"Okay. So if this is all you called about, I think we're done here\". She told me we all needed to \"Get over what happened to us and move on with our lives!\" (She moved out long before the abuse started and wasnt around for any of it)\n\nRegardless of my personal experience, I can't help but feel like I did something wrong. I have limited to no  contact with my Mother because of her husband, and she denies any abuse ever happened to any of us... My sister asked \"Why dont you just pop in and see the conditions?\" I told her \"I cant be around (my stepfather). I refuse to subject myself to that negativity again\" \n\n While by husband and siblings agree it was the right thing to do... I still can't help feeling wrong for it.... like it \"wasnt my place\". But if it wasnt my place, whose was it? \nI really would like a third party outside opinion about what I did. \nAm wrong for reporting my family? Honestly, should I of just kept my mouth shut?\n\n\nI don't mind having no contact with my Mother or eldest sister.  They dont even know Im nearly 4 months pregnant because of how very very little we talk as it is.  So the potential of never really having a relationship doesnt bug me really. What bugs me is not knowing if I was in the right. \n\n\nTL;DR\nI called cps on my mother based on previous experience with being abused mentally and physically from our step father. I havent heard from my younger siblings in a while because communication had been cut. We lived with deplorable conditions, animal feces, garbage and clutter everywhere, being hit, having things thrown at us, etc. I told cps that I wasnt sure if anything was for sure happening still because again, we dont have contact, but that I wanted them to check on my siblings.  Was I totally out of line?\n\n\nEdit - \nI really appreciate the overwhelming response. I didnt expect this to get much attention. \nI will post an update as soon as there is an update to post. Again, I really really appreciate the responses",

            "Your sister has to believe that it wasn't your responsibility or purvue to call CPS on your mother, because otherwise she would have to confront the fact that she never did this to protect you, when you were abused. She has to believe that it wasn't so bad for you after she left, because otherwise she abandoned you and your siblings. \n\nAnd she can't face that guilt. You have to be the bad one to her, so she can preserve her sense of self and innocence.\n\nThank you and a hug from an anonymous internet stranger. You are a great person for taking action!\n\nEdit: Thank you :-)",
            "It is EVERYONE's place to ensure the safety of children. \n\nYour sister is 100% in the wrong. The role of CPS isn't to just remove kids willy-nilly, it is to keep them safe from abuse and neglect. If the kids aren't being abused and neglected, that's great. If they are being abused or neglected, then something needs to change.",
            "Girl I just feel like I want to shake your hand or give you a hug or something! I feel like applauding. What you did was right, it was courageous and it was necessary. Good on you for following your gut and doing what you needed to do. \n\nI'm sorry you experienced abuse,and I'm glad to see that you've gotten free from it and created a great family life for yourself.  All the best",
            "I'd rather feel like shit for calling the cops than feeling like shit if I didn't call the cops and thebl worse happened",
            "Yeah, I called CPS on my aunt and that side of my family freaked out at me for it. Unfortunately, nothing came from it because she does a very good job of making everything look ok, and my grandparents believe her when she says it's her kids who are the problem. Yeah, sure Dee Dee. All 8 of your kids are just naturally fucked up, has nothing to do with your parenting.\n\nPlus, none of the kids trust adults (I'm the only one as far as I know, and that's just because I'm closer to their age) so when CPS interviewed them, they didn't share anything.\n\nBut now my poor mom gets verbally assaulted by my aunt about how she raised such a terrible daughter who would turn her back on family yada yada yada...\n\nI don't regret calling. Now when something obvious does happen, they'll have my repirt on file. I just wish they could have done something sooner.",
            "I worked in an elementary school and was mandated to call CPS if I suspected abuse or neglect. I called CPS at least a dozen times. I know it's very different when it's your family, but I've seen what CPS does, and they're not this evil monster agency people make them out to be because of a few stories that are bad enough that you hear about them in the media. They are there to help. They're not there to take kids away and ruin lives. They're there to protect children and get families the resources they need. \n\nYou 100% did the right thing and of course your sister is going to make you feel bad about it because she's enabling the bad behavior of your mother. Ironically, she's the one who hasn't moved on with her life. She's still stuck there, telling herself what happened wasn't that bad.",
            "It seems to me that you did what you did out of love for your siblings. Nothing wrong with that. Your older sister\u2019s opinion is just one you should ignore. \n\nI would suggest you talk to your husband again. Mostly to talk about taking your siblings in if CPS takes the children away from your parents. If you can support them properly. If he\u2019s on board with that as an option. There generally is some kind of financial support from the state should that occur and you could keep them out of the foster care system.",
            "When I was 14 and I threatened to tell my mom how I was being treated at home, she made me feel awful by saying, \"do you want to be taken from us??\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd holy shit, was that effective. I never opened my mouth. It would be my fault if I were taken away. And how awful that would be for me and my family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I was maybe 28 and five years into therapy before I understood that it absolutely wouldn't have been my fault. And the worst was that I had seen my brother continue the cycle of abuse with HIS kids, not \"getting it\" until it was too late. I am so grateful that you didn't take as long as I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get that you feel bad, but know that it's the lingering impacts of abuse. Your gut was right. Your sister either doesn't get it because she didn't have it as bad as you did, or because she ALSO has internalized the absolute BS you received. I don't know which, but I think a little pity might be appropriate.",
            "You definitely did the right thing.  Don\u2019t second guess yourself, as you said to your older sister if there are no issues  then there\u2019s no problem.  \n\nIf however there are some issues, your mum will get support to change and it can only benefit your sisters lives. \n\nIf it is severe enough to consider removal, then again, it can only benefit your sisters lives...  x",
            "Don\u2019t feel bad. I did the same thing to my mother. My step dad was abusive to my siblings and I as well. One day he put me in the hospital and when the cops offered a restraining order I thought that was going to get rid of him. Nope, my mom kicked me out instead. \nEven though he focused most of his abuse towards me I knew it was only a matter of time before the little ones got under his skin and he hurt one of them. My mom wouldn\u2019t allow me into the house but everyday I would sit outside their house and call CPS and told them I feared for the safety of my sisters after what he had done to me. My mom would find places to hide him so it seemed like he wasn\u2019t there. But I didn\u2019t give up, I called day and night urging them to keep tabs on my siblings before it was too late. \nEventually my mom got sick of the harassment and tried to pack up and leave the state with them. Cops found them just as they were crossing the state border with drugs in the car and my POS step dad.  My sisters were taken away and put into foster care. At the time I felt guilt and anxiety about the life changing choices I had made for them. They were all adopted by the most loving family and i know today I made the right choice. Please don\u2019t believe they won\u2019t endure what you endured. Because they will, and that guilt will be a lot heavier than calling CPS I promise you. I wish you luck OP",
            "Also, depending on what kind of faeces you would be exposed to on just \u201cpopping in\u201d, you could potentially harm yourself and the baby. \n\nI believe cat faeces are harmful, I don\u2019t know about other animal types. \n\nYou did the right thing.",

There's not a difference in opinion here, its a matter of health and safety.",

            "OP, you did amazing. And the way you handled your sister deserves some kind of award. Never, ever doubt yourself for making that call - you absolutely did the right thing and now your siblings still living at home might now have a fucking chance, thanks to you. Your older sister can deal with her feels, they're not your responsibility.\n\nAnd congrats on your pregnancy!",
            "As a social worker (not for DHS or CPS)  I agree you did the right thing. I've had to make calls and the parent does find out. It's hard at first, but it's more important that those kids are safe. More important than any personal relationship.",

            "You definitely did the right thing. Imagine the guilt you'd feel (and your older sister too) if the worst happened and one of your younger siblings actually got seriously ill or even died, and you could have said something all those years ago and didn't. The worst that happens is they go round and have a look and the place is fine and the kids are fine, but things like filthy houses and abuse don't just go away overnight, so I think your worries are entirely legitimate. If the kids are too young/scared to do anything themselves, then someone else needs to step in and make the call to help keep them safe. They may not even realise that something is wrong with their upbringing if they know no different. I hope they're okay, an update would be nice if you manage to get back in touch with them.",

Feeling guilty and like you did something wrong so easily is something most abuse victims struggle with, even if they know deep inside they didn't do anything wrong. That's the case here. \n\nYour sister thinks family bonds and the right of your parents to handle things as they wish is more important than the safety and well being of your sisters, and that makes her an enabler.

All you were doing is making sure. \n\nIf I were you I'd call to check up, tell them that you're siblings and you'd like to know updates (if they stay in the house or not) so that if they are taken into foster care you can help with whatever is possible for you.",

I was just about to ask for a therapist referral and when she said that, I was like, uh-huh, okay,  guess I'll find a new therapist on my own. I cannot abide this attitude that what happens to you in your childhood *doesn't* follow you around for the rest of your life without proper treatment.

If you were my student and I found out that there were still children living in that household, I would be legally required to report that information. Your sister thinks that it's just a different parenting style, bit she wasn't there for when things got bad.  Abuse isn't a parenting right, child abuse is against the law and if you have any sense that your you never siblings are at risk, then you've done the right thing. I'm SO glad you didn't keep your mouth shut. \n\nYou made a difficult choice but an important one. And honestly, within recent years, at least in my state, CPS has shifted their model and it's not just \"baby snatching.\" Their goals are to keep families together and provide resources like in-home therapy options so families and develop the skillsets they need to build healthier households (unless there is blatant extreme abuse happening and the actual safety of the child is at stake).",
            "You did the right thing. If you were to go to therapy there's a chance your therapist would contact CPS anyway as a mandated reporter. This happened with my mom and stepdad (my little bro is still in the house). I totally get what you are going through, but keep reminding yourself you did the right thing! -No matter the outcome. Those kids shouldn't have to deal with that kind of environment. As far as your sister goes, the top poster on this thread hit the nail on the head. My oldest sister is the same exact way.

            "Not out of line, nope. You had very real concerns and you were absolutely right to take the course of action you took. When people ignore abuse, that's what allows abuse to happen.\n\nStay strong and stick to your guns. Always!",

Do they know that they can call you to come get them if they need to get out?? \n\nI think this is something you and your older siblings (including your eldest sister) should all discuss and decide who can and is willing to care for the younger ones if it comes to that. \n\nGood luck.

            "When I was young, my mom called DFS on her younger sister, who was involved with drugs (mostly using). My 3 younger cousins were taken from my aunt once or twice already. Years later all four of them are fine. My aunt has been clean and is an amazing mom to my cousins. That probably wouldn\u2019t have happened if my mom hadn\u2019t called. And she did it for the safety of her nieces! She probably felt conflicted about it too. There\u2019s nothing wrong with doing what you can to help take care of your family!",
            "You did the right thing. My dissertation is on child welfare and I am pretty familiar on policies/functions of CPS in my state. \nCalling CPS is can be scary because we often times only hear nightmare stories of when things go wrong. Also, most people think the main job of CPS is to remove kids. In actuality, only a small amount of cases will result in removal, with removal mainly being reserved for situations in which there is immediate risk of danger/harm. When removals do occur, they are mostly intended to be short term. CPS tries to place removed children with family members (i.e. you). During the removal period, the parents will be required to make changes to ensure a safe environment (go to anger management classes, clean the house, etc.) or face the chance of a permanent removal. \n\nIf children stay in the home, the parents will be legally mandated to do similar tasks as mentioned above. \n\nRegardless of what happens, CPS can be very helpful to families by connecting them to needed services and motivating parents to change given the legal mandates. At very least, CPS can help ensure children who are in immediate danger will be safe through removal. \n\nI will say that this is a description of how CPS should work and sometimes CPS struggles to do a perfect job due to lack of resources, but hopefully it makes you feel a little better about your decision.",
            "The main reason that abuse continues is because people keep their mouth shut. Any physical or mental harm on anyone should be spoken to by someone who can make a difference about it. You should never feel guilty about showing you care about your sibling's health and wellbeing.",

I wish I'd have done the same for my two younger siblings before my mom ended up in jail and my aunt took over their care, but they ended up in good hands anyway. We endured less than you guys did, but my mother was mostly very neglectful alcoholic, and their father was long gone. They were 12 and 13 when I left, but it didn't make me feel any better that they were old enough to really get the situation and somewhat take care of themselves.. I really sometimes wish I'd have done what you did. Keep that courage and trust that somehow it'll work out, one way or another.",

If there are no problems in the house, then it should all be over with quick and easy. I would HATE getting that agency involved unless it was absolutely necessary, and in this case, it seems like it was.\nDon't get me wrong, your siblings are about to be subjected to a whole new set of challenges, but at least (hopefully) they'll be in a clean environment and not be getting physically/emotionally abused. \nI completely understand your not wanting to subject yourself to your step-father's negativity, however, if you're that concerned for your siblings' well-being, please stop by and check on them, see how conditions are. You sound really sweet and really strong, I think you can put up with him for a brief visit. \nGood luck with your pregnancy. \nYou know exactly how Not to parent, and you care, so you're going to be great!! Good luck to all of y'all, and keep us posted. We'll want an update about what's going on!",

            "I have a very similar situation. I still pretend everything is cool with stepdad so I can see siblings and mom left everyone a few years ago but we were abused in the same ways and the house was the same gross state. It's a lot better now, stepdad has really upped his game. But there's still things I dont like that my siblings have to deal with. I wish at some point I had the balls to call CPS, I never did because I didnt think foster homes were any better. I think you did the right thing. I try to be for my siblings the person I needed when I was a kid and I think it's a good thing you're doing that for yours. Honestly you're right if there's nothing bad happening then CPS wont do anything. But if there is, they might be able to get parents to be better. I know exactly why you feel like you did something wrong, I've had the same feeling when telling other family about my dad. I get it. It's probably conditioned in you by the parents. But you should know that you didnt do anything wrong. I wish good things for you and your siblings. Ignore your older sister, if she wasnt there for the bad stuff then she cant understand. Maybe tell her that.",

However don't be surprised if your younger siblings don't appreciate what you tried to do for them. As a foster parent I know it is natural for a child to rather be with their abusive parent than be in a safe, clean foster home. So they may be upset with you if they are removed from the home. Just know that you did the right thing no matter if it hurts someone's feelings.",

Her mother is an addict and had two children under the age of 5 in her care, was know to CAS and called the police for a welfare check as her mother put on FB that she was taking sleeping drugs and didn't want to wake up. \n\nThe police carried out a check and took the children into temp custody. Her mother always throws this in her face but she did the right thing. The first priority is the children who are at risk. \n\nWe actually now have both the kids in our custody and will be adopting soon. Trust your gut, you did the right thing.",
            "I've called a wellness check on a friend before. I had reason to believe she was mistreating her child and herself, and I did my moral obligation in making sure a child was not at risk. Even though the child wasn't related to me, I believe it's *everyone's* responsibility to keep an eye out for potential abuse.\n\nShe did much the same thing. Ranted and raved about how I was going to break her family apart, how a little girl was going to get tossed into foster care because of my 'selfish' actions, threatened self harm if anything happened from the visit, etc. I let her rant and gave her space.\n\nA few days later, she contacted me again. She told me that I absolutely had reason to make the call, that she accepted it wasn't selfish of me to do it, and that she'd lashed out because she was scared. In fact, the officers that showed up gave her resources to manage her own life better so that her kid could have a better home life. She straightup admitted that it was a positive change, getting the wellness check. Unfortunately, after admitting that she also admitted that even though it *was* a positive change, it had changed how she viewed me and she no longer wanted to be friends. \n\nWas it worth it? Absolutely. *Any action that can potentially protect a child from abuse is always, always worth it.* If your family doesn't see that, it's their problem.",
            "It sounds like you still live with the guilt of being a victim of abuse. Where your abuser makes you feel guilty for doing the right thing.\n\nThank you for calling. The fact that you are so torn up about it---care so much about doing the right thing; supports that this was ultimately the correct move.\n\nEven though it caused you hurt and turmoil, you did it anyways. Because, it was never about you, it was about your younger siblings and doing what was right--even though it was been so hard. \n\nYour older sister is probably trying to process all this. It can be a lot to wrap your head around- realizing that your parents have acted abusively and negligently. Especially when, even if abuse has been directed at an individual, they still love their parents. Perhaps some version of cognitive dissonance for your eldest sister?\n\nPerhaps she needs to be cut off from your life in the meantime? At least, until such a point when she is able to come to terms with your mom and stepdad's choices and how it affects her siblings. She needs to stop making excuses for the abusers and step up for the victims.",

            "As someone who had CPS called on their parents for no reason (vengeful ex boyfriend of my older sister), I want to thank you for what you did for those kids. \n\nYes, it was a horribly stressful ordeal for my family. Yes, my baby sister slept with my mom for months in fear they\u2019d come to take her away. But you know what? They were incredibly kind and understanding. They investigated to the best of their ability and were just trying to make sure we were safe. I have the utmost respect for CPS and believe in what they do. If there was nothing for your family to fear, then they\u2019ll be fine. If the conditions are still how they were when you left than those kids need someone to correct that behavior. Even if it\u2019s just the condition of the house. Usually with a dirty house like you described they will simply help them clean and get rid of stuff and try to teach them new habits so it doesn\u2019t continue to happen.",
            "Honey, if strangers that don't love the kids are allowed to call CPS, you who love your siblings absolutely have the right, and some would say duty, to do it. Kudos and I hope everything gets better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for being an awesome human. We need more of those.",
            "> Regardless of my personal experience, I can't help but feel like I did something wrong.   \n   \nI spent most of this week in an adolescent psychiatric unit dealing with the consequences of some bad parenting. Bringing light to a situation is one of the ways you disenfranchise bad actors.... it's much harder to be bad in the light than the dark. Every jurisdiction has it's +/- with respect to how they do things and what can be done. Kids don't get removed from homes without there being significant levels of abuse and dysfunction - and sometimes calls like this activate resources that can help everybody in a family - it's not punitive action.... it's responsive.\n   \nGood luck to you and your family. Continue with your own therapy and healing - keep caring and seeking support from your husband - and just make sure you are honest and succinct through the process with the information you give to social workers. There usually has to be an overwhelming level of abuse top get kids removed as the system in any country is constrained by economic resources, but at the least some oversight and follow up from CPS or similar will be better than nothing if the kids remain in the home.",
            "I could never think someone is wrong for making sure children are safe. Especially under those circumstances. My only issue is the response to your sister's question of \"what if they're taken away?\" \"that isn't on me\" is kind of the wrong response to me. It is on you. You made the report. The result is them being taken away. I'm sure you didn't mean it that way but it comes off as a total disregard for what happens to them after they are removed. Let's say they were taken away from your mom. Would you assume custody? Is there family that would take them in? You may think a foster home would be better than their situation but you could be totally wrong. They could also end up in Juvenile detention centers with delinquents. I've been there so I know first hand. While I feel you were right to make a call if you were truly concerned for their welfare, I also feel like by making that call you should have a plan in place to prevent them from ending up in an even worse situation. If you've ever read the book A Child Called It, you would understand what I mean.",
            "Congrats on being an amazing person and looking out for your younger siblings. You have nothing to feel ashamed or guilty about. Your just protecting them. They will thank you one day.

We came up for a visit and the house was utterly disgusting and no one thought anything of it. The kids didnt seem to mind living among the mice and bugs. Disgusting. I denied being the one who called but I think they knew anyway. My husband at the time agreed it was the right thing to do. He didnt want his siblings living in that either. \n\nCPS told them their kids couldn't live in the house until they got it cleaned up. They separated them all out to different families within the church. They went home within 3m. I never saw the house again but I'm sure after a year or so the house went back to the way it was. MIL was a hoarder. It's a mental illness, not something you can just get rid of.",

The reality is that he is still enmeshed in that cycle of abuse and will likely expose future generations to it, and if that is the case I won't hesitate to protect any children by calling CPS because I know what will happen from first-hand experience.\n\nI am telling you this because **sometimes to do the *right* thing we have to do the most *difficult* thing, even though it breaks our heart. Your family may never be the people you wanted and needed them to be, but you are the person those kids need right now.** You did the right thing OP, never second-guess that.

There are enough people who need medical attention who don't get it, why create a situation for someone who can actually receive the medical attention?\n\nI think you did right in calling CPS.

The gesture and affirmation that someone cares will do wonders for their self esteem; likely, they have assumed they don't deserve better or aren't worthy of a different life.\n\nThank you for helping to minimize the damage and offer a glimpse of hope.\n\nThank you for having the strength to hold the adults involved accountable.\n\nAs for yourself, I would venture that the effects  your own survived trauma have on your are more substantial than you may realize. Guilt, shame, fear, worry, and other reactions to doing the right thing jump out to me as the byproducts of manipulation and having your self esteem cut down and depleted.\n\nDo you have a counselor to help you work through the effects of your childhood abuse?  If not, I think it's a good time to start looking for one.\n\n\nInternet hugs to you. You did the right thing.",
            "Thank you for checking up on you're siblings! I had a very similar experience with my older sister. I had gotten a call from my younger brother that my father was beating my younger sister with a charger because she supposedly broke it. I called the police straight away due to being at my boyfriend's house at the time. Afterwards my boyfriend took me home when the police showed up so I can check up on my family ( and because I Know my mom will lie  for my dad).  My dad was later issued a restraining order. The next day, my older sister sent me a lot of hate messages. Saying what if the kids had gotten taken away? Why didn't you just go and see what happened? She even told cps that I was a crazy minor that was always out passed her curfew, so I shouldn't be trusted. I was appalled because she knows how bad it used to be at my house. Hell she took beatings as much as my mom did! I'm on better terms with her now, but I'll never forgive her for what said about me.",
            "You were in the right.  Everybody who knows you and knows the situation agrees you were in the right.  As you said, it's only a problem for them if the situation in the house is still problematic, in which case you're saving your siblings from further abuse",
            "Your a very kind person. Don't double guess yourself. You are on the right thought. If there is nothing to hide nothing to worry. If it's very bad the siblings get a better future, may be hard initially but it's for the better in future. You may have something on your plate depending on the siblings situation, nothing that someone with your mind and heart can't deal with. Support them the best you can things will improve. I love you for the person you are. Hugs. And congratulation on your kid, stay healthy and fit. Read books on how brains of children develop in the early years - neural network. It's astounding. Good luck to you and the best for you future dear.",

            "There have been so many (too many) kids that have prayed someone will notice their abuse and do something to help them. Praying a teacher or neighbour will speak up. Sadly too many people take that attitude of oh it's not my place or not my children, can't judge parenting, it might be fine. As you said, if there's nothing wrong it's a quick visit and no harm. They arent gonna rush in and take the kids away over nothing, if anything there is an under reaction often. You did the right thing that more people need to do. Far too many people look the other way",

If they find any cause for concern then it is better for your younger siblings now and in the future that this gets dealt with.\n\nYou can't be responsible for other people's bad parenting but I think we should all be willing to stand up for the welfare of others if there is any indication of abuse or neglect.",
            "You absolutely did the right thing. I know how stressful it can be to make the decision to call CPS; I've had to do it for work a couple times. I can only imagine this is compounded a hundred-fold being your own family, but your concern was for the kids that have no control over their situation. Your concern was to keep them safe and there is nothing more important than that. Like you said, if they have nothing to hide, then it shouldn't be a problem. They clearly do, and the alternative of saying nothing and wondering about your siblings' well-being I feel would eat you alive. At this point, you did everything to can to ensure a safer future for them. I hope for the best for all of you.",

            "You 100% did the right thing.  CPS removed my young sister and I from our \"mother's\" care years ago and I wish I could send my gratitude to whoever called them in on her.  We no longer had to suffer and a lot of the best things in my life wouldn't have happened if I had to grow up confined there.

You did the right thing, 100%.",
            "You were absolutely in the right and well done for having those kids checked on. As you said, if there's no issue it'll be over pretty fast. Sorry you were subjected to that. I hope its not happening to your younger siblings, but if it is hopefully they'll be protected from now on.",

            "You didn't do anything wrong. Your instincts regarding CPS are on point. At the very least, they will start a case-file and if nothing is wrong, then nothing is wrong, but your parents will know they are being watched by someone in authority (especially if there is medical directives for your 2nd youngest sibling).\n\nYou likely can't do anything about not being in contact with your youngest sibling. Your parents can limit contact how they wish, unfortunately. The only thing on that one I would say is that if you believe your parents are limiting your contact with your siblings in order to hide their abuse, then that might be something CPS would be interested in knowing.\n\nDo not let your parents or your older sister guilt you. Your parents are abusive and want to downplay their abuse and your sister wasn't around for it and doesn't get to try to make you feel bad for it because she escaped it. If she can't get past this issue, you may have to limit your contact with her as well.",

It sounds like you may be their only form of protection against abuse and that is exactly what and older sister should do, protect.

I have aunts and uncles who enable my mom and try to say \u201cthere\u2019s nothing they can do\u201d which is a load of bull. They didn\u2019t go through abuse growing up so they probably don\u2019t understand the extent of how much child hood abuse can screw with your head, like your oldest sister. She might have some demons in the closest...aka regret for not being there for you guys. But that\u2019s something she\u2019ll have to handle under her own accord...especially if she wants to take out that frustration on you versus being constructive and building a strong relationship y\u2019know ? \n\nThat anxiety you have is possibly stemmed from the abuse.

Some of my extended family are freaking out, but you know what? This girl almost died three times because of the neglect. She\u2019s better off this way. They also found other signs of neglect, the girl had other health conditions that were never diagnosed that could have gotten very bad. \n\nYou did the right thing.

I bet you'll feel better tmr. Personally, I\u2019m emotionally sensitive and any personal conflicts (even like with a stranger) make me feel like hell for about 24 hours, then I can see clearly and feel better and if applicable to the situation, I forget. It took me a long time to see the pattern but now when I have any incident /negative communication /whatever I have a system: eat whatever I want even if a little pricey, take a walk, take a bath, drink hot water and watch Netflix or maybe listen to podcasts until I\u2019m asleep.

Your mother complained to her and she's only got on side of the story which is undoubtedly not the truth. \n\nIf a child is abused and then the parent denies it ever happens that is what makes me lose my shit. That is gaslighting to the max. \n\nLook, I've had it done to me. I had a narcissistic family member call CPS on me bc I refuse to let my child have contact with them. \n\nIt's nerve wracking bc you feel like a bad parent and it's an invasion of privacy but the CPS workers don't know you, they don't know that you're not abusing your child. It's their job to investigate. We have so many kids slip through the cracks so ultimately I'm glad there's an outside party that looks after them. The system isn't perfect but it can work.\n\nThey came, looked around, asked questions, wrote a report and that was it. We got a follow up letter saying cases closed.\n\nI was mad bc there was no justification for it other than spite but that was essentially the last card that family member had to play and have us the green light to go NC.\n\nDo not beat yourself up over it. Clearly you are the only ones looking out for them. They need support and proper medical care (in the case of the one with spinal and weight issues). \n\nIf you know it's still bad, call again.

Why didn't you just go over there and see what the situation was?  Just driving by the property and looking at it would have given you a better idea than nothing.  \nIf you just go around calling the authority's on people that's your right; the natural consequence that follows is those people might not appreciate you doing so and may resent your actions. \nSo it may have been good that you called.  It may have been unwarranted.  You can't say \"if they have nothing to hide nothing will happen.\" Because the variable in that mix is the CPS worker themselves.  Their perception of what is will shape the situation.  When you call them, in theory they open a inpartial investigation.  That may result in you being investigated too as a non biased investigation should.\nAlso thinking that the state taking someone's kids and placing them in foster care is the safest alternative.   I personally know of 2 situations where a child (the same one) was sexually moslested in foster care after being taken from parents who were drug users (of a lesser degree) and arguable had the children remained with parents or the  family (who called CPS) had stepped up to take the kids while mom and dad were \"handled\" by the state ,this kid would have been spared sexual molestation on 2 occasions.\n \n Who took care of these issues before CPS?  The family and community.  The local church.  Friends.  You. \n\nSo before you cast stones at your sister look at your role in this.  Why didn't you stop in? The first they hear from you in 7 years and it's this?  Because of some negativity?  You can't check on your own family because of 5 minutes of negativity?   Well...don't be surprised when your family thinks you gave them a cheap shot when CPS requires their time and money for months to come.  It will build resentment.  It also says loud and clear you cannot take time out of your day to simply stop in or chat, rather you called the government to investigate your family.  So no surprise that they are mad.  \n\nNot saying it was right or wrong what you did.  But there are consequences good and/or bad that come from calling CPS.  I'm just offering some other viewpoints.",
            "If they get put into foster care, its on you to take them un",
            "ETA - If you or any of your adult siblings had physically went to the house to check on your younger sisters and the conditions were the same as when you were a child, you'd have a good cause to call CPS. But you didn't bother to check on them and seemingly don't care what happens to them in the event they're removed from their parent's care. So your intention seems seriously tainted by ongoing bitterness from your childhood. Your older sister is right in telling you to let that bitterness go, it's only hurting you. Good luck.",
            "You know what, I don't care. Maybe I'm venting. But here I go - \n\nWhat you did was simply to make yourself feel better. Congrats. Now the children are going to be afraid of CPS, teachers, and any authorities because they will be severely punished if they speak out. Your family is going to learn to hide the abuse better. The best thing you could have done is to be there for the kids. You blew it. This was motivated by revenge. That's all this is."

        "selftext": "Link to old post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qfpn2/my_39_m_wife_30_f_of_6_years_is_upset_i_lost/\n\nThank you everyone for your posts and advice. I really appreciate it! I made a few realizations about myself and my relationship to my wife. I wasn't easing my wife into getting into a healthy lifestyle and had completely forgot that when I started out, I took it very slow. It took me 4 years to get to where I am now, and my wife was trying to keep up with my current lifestyle, which can definitely be overwhelming. \n\nI was trying to look for the perfect opportunity to talk about this with my wife, and to ease the mood a little, I went and bought her favorite bottle of wine and a bouquet. I went to talk to her in our bedroom after our son had gone to sleep, and she had these old photo albums. Apparently she had stopped by her parents place after work to help them with some summer cleaning, and she wanted to keep the photo album to go through their memories. I gave her the flowers and opened the wine and we looked through the pictures while we were cuddling. \n\nWe were leafing through the pictures, and then I saw one of a strikingly handsome man in a football uniform holding a girl that looked exactly like my wife when she was 24 kissing him. My wife was so interested in the picture, and she started tearing up a bit. I asked her what was wrong, and she pulled out her phone and showed me a picture of her parents now. They're in their 60's, and still in love, but they have lost their shape that they had in their youth. Her dad had a really large beer gut, and her mom was overweight, but they were happy. \n\nShe was saying that when we got married, she was hoping we would be like them. They never worried about losing faith in one another because their attractiveness faded as they grew older, but their love for one another continued to grow. She talked about her old boyfriend, who became so popular in college, and girls threw themselves at him, that he ended up straying; she was worried the same would happen to me because women in the neighborhood started to talk and say they wish their husbands worked on their bodies like I did. She was starting to feel really insecure.\n\nThen I took that opportunity. I gave her a kiss, and then told her that she loved me when I was fat, and women like them never noticed me. She still loves me, but those women just lust. Sure, my eyes might dart, it is physically natural, but I loved her so much, valued our relationship so much, and only needed her in my bed, I couldn't even imagine laying with another woman besides her. She started crying tears of joy, and I didn't stop there. I pushed on wards. I grabbed the picture of her parents from college, the picture she had of her parents now, and a picture of when we started dating on my phone. I told her what her parents did, lose track of their health but still grow old and love each other is one way to live life. They got the chance to see their grand kids, but I know the health problems her parents have. Then I brought up my dad, and how he wasn't able to spend much time with his grandson, and how I want to have the opportunity to see my future grandkids and maybe even great-grandkids. I said I wanted her to be by my side. I took a picture of us now, and had the picture of her parents, and said, \"Why can't this be us when we're in our 40's, 50's, 60's, till we die?\" \n\nI told her I loved her, but because I loved her so much, I wanted her to become healthy. She doesn't need to get to her pre-baby weight, or anything drastic. I told her my story of how I just wanted to get fit, but then that developed into a desire to look good, too. She admitted that she also wanted to get back her health, and at the same time she was hoping to stick to her new years resolution to lose 20 lbs. We talked, set up a plan, so she is cutting the snacks down to two cookies a day and logging everything she eats, and portion control. That was when she brought up her monthly appointment with her psychiatrist. Apparently she had been going to talk about how she could get over her overeating habits. I felt so bad. I had neglected my wife when I was trying to become healthy, when I could have included her in my journey and it would have been so much easier to do together. We set up an exercise schedule every day, and she was joking how we should have sex every day to make sure we got our cardio in. I took the in, and we had sex the rest of the night. I haven't been as intimate with my wife like I was last night since our honeymoon. I hope to keep the momentum going tonight since we both took vacation for the long weekend ;)\n\nI took the advice of being more intimate with my wife even outside the bedroom, and was kissing her and playing around with her while we were making breakfast today, when I hear a voice shout from upstairs \"DADDY! YOU SAID WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TOUCH GIRLS LIKE THAT!\" Ended up having the \"When a man and a woman are married, and love each other so much, it is ok to do that, because that is what leads to a baby\" conversation today. I can still see the shock in his eyes... but it had to happen so I can feel more comfortable kissing my wife and squeezing her butt in front of my son. \n\nI am so glad my wife does not have depression and that we were able to work together to put a plan to get back her health. She was showing me pictures of power couples, saying in a year or two she wants to take a picture like that together, so I am so glad she has that goal in mind. I also feel ashamed. When I was starting, it was to become healthy, but I liked the physical changes I saw in my body. Then for my model, I picked Leonidas from 300. But my wife, who has restarted on her fitness journey, printed out this picture of a husband and wife who are both fit. It just goes to show who loves who more, and I definitely need to work on that. \n\nAnyways, thank you so much for the support reddit. I really appreciate the help, and look forward to helping my wife with her journey, so that together we can live a long and wonderful life seeing our son grow older and his future kids. \n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Got some wine, saw some pictures of healthy/fit couples, decided we can do it together. Starting a plan slow with moderate diet changes, 3x exercise a week, and lots more sex for cardio. Scarred my son for life because he knows that maybe girls don't have koodies because his role model is grabbing his mom's butt in front of him. ",

I broke up with him. She doesn't know I exist. She sounds severely depressed, suicidal and self-harms plus issues with drugs and alcohol. He asked me not to tell her as she would \"kill herself\". Unsure if I should - moral conundrum. Help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told her. Sent her a long message from my own instagram account (no burners or anything). Lots of empathy and kindness. Told her I was on her side. She asked for proof, sent that through. \n\nEx texted me 5 mins later with \"You did it hey?\" (I'd blocked him on all social medias except for phone number). Then he weirdly thanked me; said it was better for his head and mental health now. I did him a favour. Baffled me a little. Sent him a couple harsh text messages explaining it wasn't for him, but for her. She deserved the truth. He apologised again, lol, and then I sent him a final message and blocked.\n\nGirl seemed devestated, not angry at me thankfully as I was scared of her spinning it against me which I don't think I could've handled in my... delicate state lol. Told her I was there for her. Had a little chat, but haven't talked to her since (12hrs ago). Not expecting to continue talking. Dunno if she properly broke up with him, or taking a break since they still follow eachother but she changed her profile pic so it's no longer matching and relationship date from her bio is gone. None of my business what happens next, I just hope she's okay and takes the next steps which are healthy for her. No idea if she's suicidal/self-harming - I had that in the long message sent to her that 'he told me you were vulnerable and suffering from depression so I debated sending this msg but I think you deserve the truth'. Inevitably, I think it's better for her to know rather than confide in a liar who is abusing her vulnerability. \n\nThank you to everyone who replied on the previous post, definitely helped to see other strangers agreeing with sending a message and informing her. If anyone ends up in a similar situ, I hope you never do, but send the message to the ***unknowing*** affair partner. It'll relieve your conscience I think, even though you're not in the wrong. That sounds weird, but trust me I know **I** was the one cheated on and that she was the 'other woman' but it still felt good to tell her what the real truth was, rather than him spinning it against me or never telling her. It's kinda like a final kaboom in my exes face, making sure he can't just go crawling to his other girlfriend now that I broke up with him, and she knew the full truth and can decide what to do next (break up or stay together). \n\nI feel relieved. I have finally stopped feeling nauseated and throwing up. Had my first good nights sleep since I found out. Nothing but bad feelings for the ex. I dunno if it's hate, that's a strong word. I resent what he put me through, and the waste of time, and the lies for such a long time. He's made me unsure of myself and everything he told me, but I have enough self-respect to break-up with him. Miss what I thought we had I think? I dunno. It was all lies I guess. I want him to figure himself out, mature and eventually settle down (not with me). Holding all my resentment against the cheating ex, not affair partner. \n\nThe hurt is setting in now. Last couple days it was anger. Now it's just pain lol. Now, can anyone offer post-discovering-your-long-term-partners-been-cheating-on-you-for-almost-a-year advice? I'm not used to not being busy and am having too many thoughts, I just finished final exams so have been studying for months and been busy and now its... nothing. Glad I found out after exams, but not sure what to do now. Advice appreciated.\n\n**TL;DR:** Told the unknowing affair partner via Instagram DMs on my personal account. Long, empathetic message telling her I'm on her side + proof when she asked for it. Ex texted me \"you did it hey?\" and then thanked me. Blocked his number. She seems sad, unsure if 100% broken up but pfps and date in bio changed. I don't care, not my business. Hope for the best for her. Now I need advice on how to heal, if anyone has any. Thanks.",

            "How utterly devastating. You've handled yourself really well, and believe me when I tell you that in the near distant future you'll be able to look back on this whole episode without pain, and you'll actually feel proud of how you handled yourself during a time of such hurt, betrayal, confusion and pain.\n\nYou've done so well to retain your empathy and ability to look at the bigger picture through this trauma, and these qualities will serve you well as you gain distance and perspective.\n\nThe pain will slowly diminish with each passing day until one day in a year or two you'll end up in a conversation about exes, and realize you'd forgotten him, and that when you discuss the break up it will be in terms of how you prevented his other gf from being deceived by this cheating liar.",
            "When he comes crawling back (and believe me babe, he will) you shoot me a message and I\u2019ll venmo you money for a drink on me. So proud of you girl.",
            "Proud of you. Take care of you now- entirely. Self love, trips, hobbies, etc. You\u2019re a gem and deserve all the good things.",
            "We need more people like you honestly cause mos of society don't realize that cheaters are manipulative and use it as their advantage to get another partner. Most of the time affair partner is blamed even though they had no knowledge that they were the side partners.\n\nMay you get a loving partner because that's what you deserve",
            "Great job getting rid of him and realizing it is NOT your fault.  Sometimes those that put on the best fronts are the biggest pieces of garbage.  And one day he will grow up and either have that happen to him or realize the pain he caused.  I'm sorry you went thru that hurt but hell ya for moving forward",
            "Something that sticks out to me is just how dang cowardly your ex was.\n\nHe didn\u2019t take any responsibility for his choices and he clearly didn\u2019t even **want to be with the other girl**. Like he was cheating on you with someone he didn\u2019t even like that much and had convinced himself that he somehow wasn\u2019t responsible for it and didn\u2019t have a choice?\n\nHe thanked YOU for revealing the truth to the other woman. He was RELIEVED that she would probably break up with him and it wouldn\u2019t be his fault.\n\nHe didn\u2019t even love her? He wasn\u2019t concerned that it would ruin his potential happy ever after with her: he was scared that it would be his fault if she became suicidal. Once it was someone else pulling the trigger he didn\u2019t give a crap about her mental health.\n\nJust\u2026 goddamn. Glad you saw his true colours when you did and I wish you all the best moving on from him and trusting yourself and others in the future.",
            "You can't know her vulnerabilities. Everything He told you is suspect. Of he lied about dating two girls, he can lie about their illnesses.",

            "As someone who was cheated on in a LDR years ago, you did her a service by admitting all of this to her. The fact that he told you not to tell her because she would \u201ckill herself\u201d is manipulative. He didn\u2019t want both girls knowing of his infidelity. If anyone was in her shoes, they would want to know. Blocking and moving on was your best outcome. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you, but I can assure you, one day this won\u2019t hurt anymore. You\u2019ll look back and realize how pathetic he was to cheat.\n\nAdvice? I remember when I first broke it off with my ex after is best friend broke everything to me, and the girl and I spoke to each other. It going to HURT, but do NOT check up on both of them online no matter how tempting it will be as you move on. Tell yourself that he does not deserve someone as good as yourself and keep yourself occupied no matter what. The way you\u2019ve handled yourself is amazing. This pain will pass, I promise you.",

            ">Now, can anyone offer post-discovering-your-long-term-partners-been-cheating-on-you-for-almost-a-year advice?\n\nDefinitely! First off, I feel like you did the right thing in the right way and didn't let your anger rule your decision-making.\n\nThe focus for you is going to want to drift to this time in the relationship over and over again because that's where the trauma is. That's okay, but try to direct your thoughts to the rest of the relationship. Let yourself go through the rollercoaster of thinking about the good times that make you sad for what you lost, and the bad times when you were lonely that will make you feel super weird. It's important to let yourself feel them.\n\nWhen you get tired from all the feels then your brain will, counterintuitively, be able to think clearly about the time you had with him. That's where the real grief work is done, and it will need to be done more than once.\n\nThis is a risk trap many many people fall into. The environment of an LDR is such that fidelity is a rare occurrence, and the expectation of it is faulty. That being said, boundaries are boundaries, and once set he should have honored them as you did. You were betrayed, yes, but don't lose sight of the risk taken by being in an LDR in the first place.",
            "Hi there.\nFellow been-cheated-on person here :-) I also found out myself, after finding sexy messages from the girl he had been reassuring me about for months whenever I brought up how concerned I was about her. He only admitted it to me because I had that solid evidence to confront him with.\nI get how much it really, REALLY hurts. Feels literally like someone kicked you in the stomach. I can totally relate to the nausea and sleepless nights. The thought that someone could so consistently trick and lie to you, makes me shudder and my heart break again and again.\nThis was 2 months ago for me, although it feels like a lifetime...\n\nFirstly, well done you for cutting him straight out. I didnt feel like I could do that, so I kept up a little bit of contact and meeting up, and it's taken me this amount of time to realise that it is seriously better to just cut it all off. Even if just for a little while. I'm infinitely happier now I'm not checking if he's online, watching his twitch streams, and sending him messages when I'm feeling down. Who knows if we'll ever be together again, but for now I can forget aboht him completely and sever that tie.\nI hope you find success in doing that too!\n\nSecondly, its such a clich\u00e9, but time really is the best healer...\nDay by day, it gets better. The reality of what he did to you gets a little easier to deal with, and you will slooooowly start to build a new normal and start the next chapter of your life. Just take it a day at a time. Like I said, I'm only 2 months in, and once I came to the realisation that I'm out of that situation filled with lies, I felt so much happier and ready to start over, and I feel more and more back to my old self every day.\n\nMy best advice for you, is to do what feels best in the moment: a lot of people would tell you to keep yourself busy, distract yourself, but actually Ive found that isnt always the best way. Sure I've had days where the right thing to do has been to ignore the sadness and go out and do fun things to distract myself. But I've also found it essential to have days where I sit and cry it out, either by myself or with a friend, and let the emotions flow straight through and out, and don't try to ignore or squash them. This balance is so so healthy, and I would so recommend this! I've honestly never felt stronger than when I've allowed myself to feel whatever I'm feeling, rather than pushing them down to a pit and bottling it up, which would inevitably lead to an explosion. Equally, I'm proud that I've not spent EVERY day wallowing.\nBalance is key, balance is good\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI hope all this essay makes sense, and helps. Please do feel free to send me a message if you would like to talk anything out.\nOne day at a time, and time will be the best healer. I promise it gets better!\u2764",

You are a remarkable person and you deserve someone who will truly appreciate you. I have every faith that you will find them if you are half the person you seem to be from this post. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re only twenty.\n\nI was cheated on around your age in a similar term relationship. Be kind to yourself, stay no contact and try not to jump into something new too fast. I went looking for validation and it wasn\u2019t the right move. Summer will be great for you. Get yourself out with friends, have some great new experiences and the rest will come in time.

            "The whole saga makes me wonder if she's really as \"suicidal, drug-addicted, etc.\" as he made her sound.\n\nIf I were you I would spend some time making an inventory of things he told you (not just about her, but in your entire relationship with him) that seem suspicious or unlikely or things that you think he might have been gaslighting you about.  It seems to me that, generally speaking, abusers/predators/whatevers generally just take shots in the dark with everyone to test whether you are more willing to believe them or have confidence in yourself.  If they can establish that you are susceptible to such tactics, then they'll attempt to deepen the relationship.  If you run into another one of these guys, there's no guarantee you won't fall for it again and then you're years deep feeling more guilty and insecure after spending years of your life falling for ever more sophisticated versions of this guy.\n\nI would also consider talking to a professional of some type about it.

Looking back I wish I had reached out and told her. \n\nFor me, it was straight up time that made the difference. I blocked him on everything. I talked about it seemingly endlessly with my friends and my therapist. I allowed myself to be sad and mad. I yelled and cried in my car on secluded back roads. I picked up new hobbies. I went on dating apps just for the fun of it.

I read them all but only got back to the first few who wrote in because yesterday turned into a shit show. \n\n\nIn the morning I said I wanted to go off and do my own thing (it was actually just running errands) for an hour or so alone. He said he had shit to do. Whatever...too early for me to be pissed off, so I dropped it.\n\n\nI asked again later, suggested he take our child to the park next to us since she's always asking to do stuff with daddy instead of me. Again...said no, he was going to do stuff with his hobby.\n\n\nSo, I broke down. I told him I needed help and that I *needed* a break from just being stuck at home 24/7 being a mom and wife. His response was that he didn't understand why I needed a break, but if I did I could just hang out in my room alone to get away from our child and him. And then asked me to make him lunch. \n\n\nI think it's too late for the come to Jesus talk. I have no fucks left to give, obviously he never had any.

Looking back, I think he viewed our life together as *his* life, with him as the star and me in a minor supporting role. \n\nLong story short, I finally ran out of fucks after 8 years together. It started with me asserting myself and getting a job without his \"permission\", and it all pretty much unravelled from there. \n\nOur separation was very stressful, but it was sooo incredibly worth it in the end. Once the dust settled, a friend of mine asked how I was feeling, and I told him I felt like I'd been given my life back. It's like night and day. Since we separated, I've been able to re-establish myself and regain a normal life. I work, study, go out with friends and have time for hobbies and leisure. I feel like I've been let out of prison. I know it sounds cheesy, but it actually took a while to find myself again. 8 years with him had left me a shell of my former self. \n\nSorry for the me-me-me and TL;DR, I just wanted to say that I've been where you are and come out the other side, and it is FANTASTIC. You can do this. Don't let him manipulate you out of it.

If you bring it up, he dismisses it, and you drop it, that's on you.

            "Hi OP. I responded to a different comment down below, but I wanted to provide some concrete suggestions as well. \n\nTo give your husband the benefit of the doubt, he's hopefully clueless more than malicious. You might have to really lay this out for him (in my other comment I mentioned counseling as well, as he might be making a lot of assumptions about how easy your life is \"being at home all day.\")\n\nI think a good idea is to make a list of things that will help you have a happier life. Whether it's work, volunteering, getting out with friends once a week, a gym membership, what have you. Write down things you want.\n\nPresent that list to your husband and start discussing. Don't let him stonewall the conversation. If he says \"I don't know what to tell you,\" go back to the list and say you want to talk about doing at least a few of those things. If he shoots down every suggestion as too inconvenient for him somehow, tell him point-blank he's being selfish and ignoring your needs. \n\nIf you're done like dinner and just want out of this, so be it. If you still have some fight left for it, time to bring the fight. Don't let him ignore you or shut down the conversation. If he's being selfish, call him selfish. If he's making assumptions about your life, call him out on that. Don't just say you need a break. Tell him you're unhappy and need a change. Tell him it can't continue as it has.\n\nThe benefits of this fight is that his motives will become a lot more obvious- whether he's maliciously trying to keep you isolated and dependent, whether he secretly thinks you have an easy life and are complaining about nothing, whether he's just pathologically clueless and devoid of empathy, or whether he truly hasn't understood what you need yet and is willing to work with you when you present more concrete ideas. My point is, don't let him drop the conversation with his objections and \"I don't know what to tell you.\" Push past that until you get a change.\n\nAnd yeah, marriage counseling. ",

Do you know what this tells me? That he works on work days and relaxes on his days off, that you are a stay at home mum who has a child that is school age, and that your lack of \"anything even mildly productive\" is what is actually bothering you.   \n   \nBut is that what you discussed? Did you say to him that you are going crazy with nothing to do all day? No, you attempted to force him to change his day off plans with zero warning *on the day* **twice**. You tried to solve your problem by *not discussing it with him* and instead attempting to manipulate him so that things go your way. Only when this failed did you actually try to talk to him about it, and you didn't do it by explaining that your feeling of self-worth is plummeting because of the lack of productivity you're experiencing, you instead said you need a break from being a wife and mother. Of course his response is going to be to offer to take care of the child while you rest in your room. Based entirely on YOUR words, I can see exactly why he didn't understand your actual problem. *You didn't tell him your actual problem*. You dressed it up, and shifted it from being bored having to stay home to 'tired of being mom and wife'.   \n   \nYa know, did you even want to be with him to begin with?

What you did was attempt to manipulate him, then got angry when he responded to your complaints of \"wife and mom\" by saying to take a break from being \"wife and mom\".

You will still be miserable after the divorce. There is a saying, \"Wherever you go, there you are.\" These feelings come and go which is why husband's often don't take is seriously. If you only have one kid, there is no reason you cannot get a job. If your kiddo is set to go to school, look for work during those hours. See if this improves how you feel and if your husband really was the problem or if you were simply getting depressed. There have been many times when I felt my husband was the issue and when I found something important for me, my mood improved dramatically. ",

            ">I think it's too late for the come to Jesus talk. \n\nYou swore vows to this man and have a child together; I would still try even thinking it's probably too late. I would be explicit about our current situation, including the fact that we are heading toward divorce at a very fast pace. I'd tell him that I am still committed to fix it if he is too and let the choice in his hands: can he commit to working together to make this marriage work or does he want to end it? If he chooses to end it, then that's that. If he choose to work on it, he has to truly commit to it and I'd want a concrete plan that show actual efforts toward changing things. Maybe starting with counseling.\n\nIn the meantime, I also think you need to be more assertive and stand up for yourself - which is sad because your marriage is the one place where you should be able to be vulnerable without someone trampling you. For instance, if you need a break, tell him that you'll be going to a concert on X night and he needs to arrange childcare or be there himself. Don't ask, tell him. If it comes to that, put on your coat, tell him you need a break and that you'll be gone a couple hours to the theater, walk out the door and see a movie. Take a page from his book because clearly, when he wants to do his hobby and you don't want him too, he still manages to go.",
            "People here are basically saying to get a lawyer and divorce him. I find that very disappointing. I think you're not trying hard enough to save your marriage. Both of you seem not to care. Well, you have a child. You ought to care. Have some serious talks, go to counseling, TRY for heck's sake. Have a voice and talk like sensible, rational adults. You've been married for a long time and you have a child. You've shared so much. Don't let that fall away just because you don't feel like doing the hard work. And I'm not saying to stay together no matter what, but at least give it a try ffs. Divorce is a terrible thing and it should be your last resort, not your first."

        "selftext": "So, my fianc\u00e9e has taken up cooking during quarantine. Previously, we did not cook much and instead ate out a lot. We could afford it and are generally healthy eaters. Of course, we both CAN cook but given how busy we are it was easier to eat out. Also to be honest, I don't really enjoy cooking and see it as a chore to be avoided. I love food but there are other things I'd rather do with my time.\n\nDue to quarantine, my fianc\u00e9e has decided to actually cook more and she has found she really enjoys it. This is great! I'm happy for her that she's discovered a new thing that brings her joy. Turns out she's also quite good at it and cares about learning new skills, etc., so I've been benefiting as well.\n\nI still don't really care to cook myself like I said, so in return for her putting all this effort into cooking I've been helping out by paying for take out on nights she doesn't want to cook as well as doing all the dishes and cleaning the counters, etc. for the days when she does cook. As far as I was aware she agreed that this was a suitable compromise, and of course if she felt it was unfair I would have been happy to pick up the slack in other ways. But she seemed to be happy with this.\n\nAs her cooking experiments expanded to baking and generally became more elaborate, she started to rope me into cooking. I'd head to the kitchen to get a drink and check on her and she'd be like, \"oh can you help me chop this while I saute this...\" or something. I would chop some carrots for her or whatever and chat with her about the meal and then head back to whatever I was doing. I didn't mind this at all.\n\nBut it has slowly grown into me becoming her sous chef, especially when she wants to make meals that are really easier with two people. Keep in mind her cooking experiments are elaborate and sometimes take two or more hours. So my entire evening is gone to these cooking endeavors and this happens multiple times a week. On top of that, she tends to order me around in the kitchen and can be a little rude. \n\nAs you can probably predict we had a fight about it. I told her that I dislike her attitude in the kitchen when I help, and I don't like cooking to begin with. I would feel better about helping her if she wasn't so rude to me. But quite frankly, I don't want to spend 8+ hours every week cooking. It is not MY hobby, it's hers. If she wanted me to pitch in by providing meals, I would buy them or make something simple. \n\nShe was very upset. She said that it wasn't fair that I was enjoying the fruits of her labor but not contributing, and that cooking took 2 hours but doing the dishes/cleaning only took half an hour. I told her that it was her decision to make very elaborate meals and that I would be happy if she put together a simple pizza or stir fry. After a certain point, the elaborateness of her meals crosses into hobby territory and I resent being made to feel like I'm a bad partner because I don't want to give up multiple evenings to HER hobby.\n\nWe did not really resolve this. I actually bought/made some of my own meals on a few nights so I wasn't \"enjoying the fruits of her labor\" but this seemed to make her more upset and our fridge started to fill with more leftovers than she could eat herself. Another time I ended up helping her but told her I needed to go to a videochat at 8 pm, and she got upset when I actually stopped helping to leave even though I'd told her beforehand. I told her a little snappishly, I'm afraid, that I wasn't her sous chef to boss around in the kitchen.\n\nI tried to discuss this with her again when we were feeling calmer. I told her that I loved that she found a new hobby but it is HER hobby and I can't help with it and don't want to feel obligated to do so. She retorted that it wasn't feminist of me to relegate the cooking to her and benefit from it without helping. The feminism connection makes little sense to me because previously neither of us cooked much and she chose to take up cooking herself, but of course I didn't tell her that. I told her that if she wants to discuss the distribution of labor in our house we can do so and come up with something new that reflects that she's cooking more now. \n\nWe tried to do this but she wanted to count ALL the time she spends cooking as \"chore time.\" So according to her ideal chore distribution, she spends 10+ hours cooking DINNER ONLY every week, which somehow leaves me with pretty much all the rest of the chores. I told her I wasn't happy with this, because making elaborate meals is a hobby. It isn't fair that say, 6/10 hours of her \"chores\" is actually her hobby, and I have to do an equivalent amount of actual chores, if that makes sense.\n\nSo we're at a bit of an impasse. Am I actually being a bad feminist? I don't think I am wrong (I am quite familiar with emotional labor, mental load, all that) but maybe I am. I love this woman and obviously want to marry her but we're usually good at making decisions logically and this is the first time we've had such a disagreement. I don't know how to get her to understand the boundary between cooking as a necessary activity and cooking as a hobby. I would appreciate your advice.\n\n**TL;DR: Fianc\u00e9e has taken up cooking elaborate meals as a hobby but now it's becoming an obligation for me to help and do more chores than I think I should.**",

            "My boyfriend is just like this....it exhausts me. He\u2019s a professor, and when he\u2019s working, he can\u2019t cook as much....now that it\u2019s the summer and he\u2019s not working, he wants to make an elaborate meal every night. I work full time (from home because of COVID), and when I come downstairs after work and he\u2019s been working on a meal all day, he\u2019ll start acting all pissy, like I should\u2019ve been helping him but didn\u2019t. I want to be like, \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to do all this, though...?\u201d\n\nI actually don\u2019t mind doing the sous-chef thing when it\u2019s a lighter day at work...it can be kind of fun. Honestly, it\u2019s the dishes that kill me. Every meal he makes produces like 50 different dirty dishes that have to be hand washed (we don\u2019t have a dishwasher, and our kitchen sink is tiny.) It\u2019s because the meals he makes are so complicated. I don\u2019t have the heart to tell him that I would really just rather order a pizza than stay up until 10:30 cooking and doing dishes with him, even when we do it together. By that point, I just want to watch a movie with him or go to bed. I don\u2019t know what to do to get him to stop cooking.....it\u2019s killing me \ud83d\ude2d",
            "I don\u2019t have any actual advice, just, I\u2019ve been there. I like to cook and sometimes very elaborate meals and it took me a long time to realize that my family was actually happier with the simple meals. I\u2019d get so stressed over making some fancy thing, and then right when we are about to eat there\u2019s some minor disagreement and I felt like dinner was ruined after spending hours on it. I\u2019m not sure what anyone could have said to me to make me realize it sooner though so sorry if this isn\u2019t much help. I make a lot more pizza and hamburgers these days.",
            "I\u2019ve spent a long time in food service and am good friends with chefs. This has taught me that one of the biggest components of getting food made quickly is prep...something that is literally a full time job. \n\nIf this is really her passion project, she should do more prep. That means having things chopped, marinated and sauces and such prepared as much ahead of time as you can. Cooking is an ORDEAL when you don\u2019t prep properly and are doing everything on the fly. \n\nOne or two days a week devoted to prep would make your lives a lot easier.",
            "I would try to remind her also about what purpose the cooking is serving. Validate that it is a lovely hobby for her, but remind her that if its starting to stress her out, it may be leaving hobby territory and entering chore land (hence why she feels upset youre not \"pulling weight\"). I would remind her that you can always eat out if stressed but that this is just s fun hobby",
            "I don't have much advice either.  It sounds like things have devolved a little bit into \"keeping score.\"  You both may need a breath so you can refocus on being present and enjoying each others' company without expectation instead of always thinking about who is giving and who is taking.  How you do this, I couldn't say, but it's something to think about.  Consider your love languages.  Personally, I HATE doing the dishes and you've made me realize how grateful I should be when my bf cleans as I cook.",
            "I would have another discussion. I would start out by telling her (or telling her again) how *her behavior* has made *you feel*, and you'd like her help in coming to a resolution that is fair to both of you. Talk about her feelings too. Where is all this intensity coming from? Why does she feel pressured to cook like this?\n\nThen show her a more realistic chore distribution. Research how long on average it takes people to make dinner. Remind her that you didn't ask her to chain herself in the kitchen for hours. Bring easy recipe ideas. Offer to cook part of the time.\n\nEdit: removed \"her\" from my \"her her\" sentence.",
            "I'm actually pretty frustrated with your wife for claiming that you are being antifeminist with this, because, as a feminist, I'm familiar with the fact that there are women all over this planet who genuinely have NO choice but to slave away in a kitchen, while their partners do nothing and express no gratitude. She is turning this into a Cause, when she has no business doing so.\n\nIt sounds like she's not actually enjoying the cooking all that much. If she's this stressed, if she's demanding help, if she's seeing it as a chore, then it's obviously not a happy hobby to her, and she doesn't have to be doing it, so *why is she?*\n\nThe only advice I have is to put it to her this way. An analogy: You both do an equal portion of the yard work. You mow and she sprays the weeds, and that's really all your yard needs to be orderly, safe, and up to code. But then you decide that you wanna try out gardening. She's like \"Oh, that's not something I want to do, but you have fun,\" however, she does keep spraying the weeds, which was the chore the two of you decided was fair in the first place. So you start planting flowers and shrubs, and then you put out a bird bath, and you have to trim the shrubs, and you have to keep the army caterpillars away, etc., etc., so you ask her for help once in a while, when you need an extra pair of hands. And at first, she helps gladly, but then you get rude and bossy, and then you start saying how much time you spend on the gardening, and it's not fair that you are doing all this labor that she enjoys but doesn't assist with... But it's labor that you CHOSE to do. It's not necessary. She didn't ask you for it. But now you're acting like your hobby is somehow HER responsibility. Ask her if this situation would be fair on her, because that is exactly the situation that she has put you in.\n\nEDIT: typo",
            "Have you tried talking to her about the recipes she\u2019s preparing? Find one of those 30-minute weeknight meal blogs and show it to her. If she insists that she prefers the longer recipes, I\u2019d try again to drill home the idea that she\u2019s doing this because she enjoys it, and that\u2019s great, but that doesn\u2019t qualify as a chore. You\u2019re already doing what I think is totally reasonable - cleanup and taking care of dinner an equal number of nights a week. \n\nIf you still want to offer some help, let her know you\u2019re happy to do a little prep work before she gets started - chop/peel veggies or whatever.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t work, I don\u2019t know, it honestly might be worth some couples therapy.",
            "your explanations make complete sense to me. have you asked your fiance to read your post? maybe you could have her read this post and ask her what she disagrees with. but it seems like she found herself a hobby that also is arguably a chore, and she wants to be appreciated for the work she's put in as a chore as well as enjoying this new hobby while roping you in. if she can't recognize that's she's being a little unfair...i don't know.",
            "There's not an impasse. She doesn't want to compromise. \n\nI love cooking. I love baking. I would never boss someone around if they were being nice enough to help. \n\nShe needs an attitude adjustment. How can she not see that spending two hours an evening cooking isn't everyone's idea of a good time even if it results in a nice meal? Sometimes after cooking for a long time I don't even want to eat.\n\nYou guys should try making cooking in a short time a challenge. Thirty minute or less meals are a lot of fun to make. She can do the elaborate cuisine on her time.",
            "Tell her that you\u2019d be happy to take over responsibility for cooking dinner yourself. With 5 x a week of cooking a quick half hour meal and 2 nights of takeaway, that is 2.5 hours of cooking time. Then she can take over other chores instead. \n\nIf she instead insists that she be the one to do the cooking and wants to spend 2 hours a night cooking something elaborate, that\u2019s something she\u2019s doing for her benefit as a personal hobby that in no tangible way benefits you, that you do not enjoy and that in fact makes your quality of life worse. She\u2019s being manipulative and disingenuous by trying to claim this is a chore she is doing that benefits you both and as a result it\u2019s fair for you to take over all other chores in the house. She has some nerve to try and bully you and claim you are antifeminist and taking advantage of her labour when actually she is using her personal hobby to try and take advantage of your labour and make you do an unequal amount of actual genuine and unavoidable chores. She is either pretty dim if she doesn\u2019t get all this, or she\u2019s doing this deliberately and is just selfish.",
            "You sound like a great guy. You've done everything you can to try to support her but it doesn't sound like she's being very understanding of your dislike for cooking. Honestly I'm surprised you not eating her food because you didn't help cook it would be enough of a wake up call for her. \n\nI was in the same situation. I hate cooking, I'm quite content opening a can of green beans for supper. My partner always said it was a bonding, relationship building task (though we would just fight cuz he'd always tell me how to do things, I hate cooking but I know how and didn't need to be taught). A whole lot of complaining and dragging my feet before he realized that I just don't get the same enjoyment as he does from it. Apparently just being up front wasn't enough because in his mind it was \"how is it possible not to love cooking, you just need to do it a bit to awaken the passion\"\n\nSeems childish to take my route haha. Maybe sit her down, yet again, and say you're willing to help like once a week, but you don't enjoy cooking and rather spend your time doing your own hobbies. I know you already tried, but doesn't seem like she hears you so I think you just have to keep reminding her. Maybe she's in newlywed mind where she thinks you're both supposed to love all the same things and do everything together. Just throwing out possibilities now. Sorry im not much help. But hopefully things sort out",
            "You're not a bad feminist, it sucks your wife is saying stuff like that just to hurt you. It sounds like you think and care a lot about gender equality and feminism. Obviously if you were actually a bad feminist, you wouldn't be bothered by the accusation because you wouldn't  care about women or being a feminist.\n\nAlso, I would take turns being responsible for dinner. One day its hers and you may get suckered into helping a bit, the next day you order take out or make something simple. She doesn't get to be captain of the kitchen and not do anything else just because she's decided that's what she enjoys.",

I also do all the dishes after and don\u2019t like cooking and if I do cook I keep it simple. I\u2019ll also help with quick tasks\nSimple some which include Washing and drying lettuce, cooking the pasta, or defrosting something. But it something I can do in ten mins and then go back to doing whatever I was doing. \n\nAlso a lot what we do is that my husband will make a big dinner Monday and Tuesday night and then Wednesday we will have Mondays left overs and then Thursdays have Tuesday\u2019s. She could try something like that. I\u2019m assuming as time goes on she will not want to cook as much and maybe can fall into this type of pattern. \n\nI guess I don\u2019t have any real advice for you other than to try and work out some realistic situations where she isn\u2019t cooking every night and you are taking care of a few nights a week. Which could be something simple or takeout or whatever. I think she\u2019ll get back to a point to enjoying simpler quicker things",
            "Yeah idk, sounds completely unreasonable to me, I am essentially your gf in my current relationship. I cook 9/10 dinners, sometimes its simple and sometimes I go hard, but I do the cooking because I think it can be fun and I give it my best effort every time because I personally want to eat something good. My gf does the dishes and most of the cleaning but we've discussed labor distribution and are both on the same page. Cooking dinner isnt even that hard god damn, once youve made a meal 3-4 times its pretty easy. \n\nFuckin hell most of the time I dont want any help because its usually not needed and the kitchen is small.",
            "The whole \"feminist\" argument is manipulative, unfair, and untrue.  It's her hobby, her choice.  You aren't forcing her to cook elaborate meals.  And if she wants to stop cooking, I presume you would be fine with her stopping.\n\nI think a good compromise would be to say that the first 30 minutes of cooking is a chore, anything after that is a hobby, because it's absolutely possible to cook a moderately complicated dinner for 2 in less than 30 minutes.",

            "My boyfriend is just like your fiance. He likes to make chicken fried rice and my god is that shit like fucking ambrosia. However, me getting asked to chop five different kinds of fucking vegetables while he makes the special chicken in his special way sucks the love and enjoyment out of it. He likes to cook elaborate, complex meals that take over an hour and a half to make and I get roped into either helping, or forever told that \"it's not like you any of the cooking\" joking or not, I hate getting caught in that. \n\nSo we decided that he got to pick 3 meals a week where he could do whatever he wanted, but he was not to ask me to do anything more than \"tv prep\". This entitled things like peeling potatoes, chucking corn, or chopping vegetables (within reason), anything that could easily be done while watching tv or relaxing in the living room. This way, he is able to make what he wants and I can still contribute. \n\nIf he makes something that will take less than an hour or that is simple, obviously it becomes a 50/50 task and does not count towards his 3 meals. To balance things out, I'm in charge of breakfast and lunch, sometimes dessert if I'm feeling up to it. For cleanup, if he makes a colossal mess, I help for the first 20-30 minutes and then he's on his own. He does not help with cleanup after my meals as they aren't usually messy. We work well this way, but I'm not sure what will work for you and your fiance. Talk it out, but her cooking as a hobby should not be delegated under \"chores\". Dinner doesn't need to take more than an hour (not including baking time) and if she wants to cook something elaborate, that is entirely her choice.",
            "I think the solution here is compromise. It would be nice to spend 1 or 2 nights spending time with your partner and her hobby but still have lots of time to yourself or spend 1-2 nights on your hobby together.  Relationships are about sacrifice.",
            "This seems like a tough situation. I think I might approach it by suggesting that you split nights cooking and on your nights make simple meals. It might help her realize a couple things. 1. She wants to cook. 2. Her meals have gotten out of control. And 3. That this is sort of a hobby. \n\nBy volunteering to cook half the meals you can split meals as chores instead of splitting chores by time alone.  Then you can make 20 minute meals vs spending 2 hours a night as a sous chef. She may decide she wants to cook all the meals and you could \"trade\" her those chores back. \n\nNot sure if that would work but that is what I would try.",

I imagine she doesn't just like it as a hobby or her responses here are completely unreasonable. Maybe she feels like you guys need to be healthier or save money---and then it would feel insane when she's putting in all this effort for your mutual good for you to both not help and not see it as a chore. Yes, she doesn't detest the chore but it's still a chore.  \n\n\nI'd put together a reasonable meal plan that fits whatever her issue is (healthy? saving money? figure it out) and count it as a her chore to cook dinner---she's welcome to make anything she wants, but in terms of chore allotment the meal plan calls for thirty minute top prep per evening.   \n\n\nNow arguably you don't think you should need to eat healthier or save money --- in which case, there she is toiling away for your mutual good (from her POV) and there you are actively resenting it because now your overall chore load went up. I don't have a good solution at that point---except perhaps get a maid.",
            "Maybe a quick way to solve the issue of how much \u201cchore time\u201d she is spending cooking, maybe when you talk to her you can say that you will be providing the dinner meal a few times a week, whether it be simple cooking or take out that way she is not spending all her \u201cchore time\u201d cooking each week. You could also compromise on top of that and offer to help her make a meal once a week so you would still have time to do hobbies you enjoy as well.",
            "I do almost all the cooking and my husband has no issue if I ask him to do the dishes. I also usually help with those too even if I just spent 3 hours in the kitchen making dinner. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how else to word this other than this scenario seems extremely emotionally immature. She has put you in a situation where you can\u2019t win. All I can suggest is that you sit her down and explain what you have here. If she can\u2019t understand that she is choosing to spend that much time in the kitchen and you doing the dishes is more than helpful and fair, you may need to re-evaluate your relationship. \n\nI\u2019m not saying break up, but someone who tells you that are basically treating her like a 50s housewife in this situation is just being a petty asshole",
            "My boyfriend picked up cooking and baking during quarantine. Sometimes he picks the nights that I'm working to create the really long, difficult meals. Anyway I enjoy cooking with him, I actually hate the chopping and the actual motions of it, especially the mess he makes. But I love the quality time we make together. Maybe that could be something you could compromise on. I like to stand in the kitchen and be an extra set of hands but I'm not actively being a sous chef. I entertain him, drink wine, maybe play some music and dance, and if he needs me to grab something out of the oven then I do that. This is one of our quality times together and it's a hobby he enjoys and some social interaction that I enjoy. \nTry to spin it into a different light for both of you to be happy.",
            "Yeah that's tough.  \n\nMaybe decide to start building a hypothetical deck and get pissed when she's not measuring 2x4's or having fun digging post holes?

Good on you both for comunicating openly. \n\nNow, I will play devils advocate (as I have been the other side of this relationship) \n\nHow I view this, and I suspect she might as well, is that cooking isn't really a \"hobby\". Cooking is something you do with love, I know this sounds clich\u00e9 but the \"love\" I mean is that the joy comes from watching your family be delighted because of your labour. And the closest of your inner circle? You want them right by your side. It took me a hot minute to realize that there was another side to this coin. \n\nIf she's anything how I used to be she probably doesn't get that there are people who view cooking as a chore. I was under the impression that is was a very close, bonding hobby. I wouldnt cook with someone I wasn't VERY comfortable with. Family or assumed future family. Sounds very primal and cavemany (its a word now) but food has always been a tribal thing and \"tribal\" in modern is BFF, or tightest of the inner circles. \n\nIn closing:\nYou give a little by trying to start another activity that you guys can enjoy together.\nShe gives a little by suppressing her matriarchy role in the kitchen (which your seeing as rude / bossy).\n\nGood luck to both of you. If this is the worst of your troubles, you will grow old together.",
            "I am a woman and do 100% of the cooking in my house. I can usually get a whole dinner done in 30-40 minutes. I also do 100% of the dishes - my partner used to do them since I cooked, but not exactly on my ideal schedule and it would just lead to arguing because I like to have them done pretty much every night so I have a clean space to prepare dinner, but they usually did them every 2-3 days. So \"the kitchen\" became my big chore and now he picks up slack in other areas (I don't ever have to touch the litter box or toilets!). My partner offers to help cook every night, but honestly I can do it better and faster myself and I enjoy it, so I (almost) always decline. \n\nAll that to say... I completely agree with you here. It sounds like you've been more than accommodating and have made a significant effort to support her and communicate your feelings (minus whatever you said to her \"a little snappishly\", which sounds a bit suspect lol). You're right - 2+ hour dinners are a voluntary hobby. 1 hour or less is what I would call \"normal\" dinner prep time for a basic to moderately fancy meal. Any more than that is completely her choice, especially since you've said over and over you're happy with something simple or paying for take out. It isn't fair to make you do basically ALL the household chores because she CHOOSES to spend much more time cooking than is actually necessary. If she loves it - great! She should continue doing it. But expecting you to subsidize all the remaining chores is unfair. (In my house, \"cooking dinner\" is considered a chore that we divide, but since it's also an activity I enjoy, I don't worry about dividing time exactly evenly. I think about it more as 'time spent doing things you don't like'. I would rather cook for an hour than clean the litter box for ten minutes! Fortunately for us, my partner feels the opposite way.) This is also not a feminist issue AT ALL - that's just her deflecting and trying to hit on an emotional topic because her side of this argument is weak. Also, asking her to help you with a few tasks (chop these couple vegetables, make the salad, etc.) every night seems fair, since you do also enjoy the dinners, but making you the assistant for 2 hours AND being rude about it is over the line. I'd say try to set a time limit of how much you can help each night, but it seems when you did that (told her you had a call at 8), she got mad when you actually went on that call. I seem to have written a novel here with little actual practical advice... sorry about that. Just keep discussing things rationally and hopefully she'll come around? As the sole household cook, I certainly don't expect all this from my partner. Best of luck.",
            "Are there any hobbies or activities you share together? I don\u2019t think you are in the wrong at all, but I am wondering if this is her way of trying to bond or spend more time together with a \u201cmutual\u201d hobby. Except she doesn\u2019t realize it is not a hobby for you as you don\u2019t like it.",
            "Do you have an equally practical yet intense hobby you can rope her into to show her how you feel?  Maybe start building a deck and insist she help.",
            "Has she shown tendencies like this in the past or is quarentine getting to her? I mean my onest suggestion is to just split up cooking, one night you cook, one night she cooks and maybe once a week you make an elaborate meal together. And whoever doesn't cook does the dishes. If she wants to cook extra on top on the nights that you cook, well that's her hobby not a chore",
            "I love to cook, and my husband is just as happy eating a pb&j as a meal that time me four hours of intense labor. I am lucky that he happily eats whatever I make for him. \n\nFor me cooking started as a necessity, we needed to eat, and grew into a hobby. Initially it was challenging and we had a similar dynamic struggle, the thing that helped us the most was differentiating between chore cooking and project cooking. We found that it was helpful and reasonable to spend about 40 mins a night throwing dinner together and took a couple dishes for a reasonable weeknight meal. If I wanted to spend more time than that it fell into project/hobby cooking and that came out of my free time and I was responsible for clean up. Not sure if that would work for you but it\u2019s worked quite nicely for us.",
            "I have no helpful solutions, but I was in a similar situation. My mom who usually doesnt cook was cooking almost 3 meals a day in quarantine. Normally, I eat one full lunch and just have a little snack for dinner. She started getting annoyed that we are not eating her food despite being told beforehand and started lamenting \" I dont want to cook anymore if you guys are not eating.\" I straight up told her \" then dont cook, no one made you, i already told you beforehand I dont want dinner\". That seemed to solve my problem.",
            "This is reminding a lot of my mum in some ways. Is your fianc\u00e9e extremely hard-working and dedicated with her work? It seems like she's replaced her work and is putting all her focus that would have gone there on to cooking.\n\nMy dad got a job in Saudi in the 70s where my mum couldn't work so she quit her job and became a SAHM, it's like she decided if she couldn't be a badass at work she was going to make being a SAHM her job and she was going to be the very best at it.\n\nDay-to-day she's not so intense, but definitely around Christmas or if they have guests over it is STRESS CITY. It's like ... she has this idea that if she doesn't make the most perfect Christmas dinner then we'll all be disappointed and the day will be ruined, when in actual fact we just wanna eat some roast potatoes, have some nice wine and enjoy our day with family.\n\nIt seems like you and your fianc\u00e9e are on very different wavelengths, I feel like she has created a narrative in her head that she has to make these amazing elaborate meals for you, but then when you're not appreciative of it she feels like it's a personal attack and/or you're not grateful. But you never asked for or expected any of this.\n\nI think you need another conversation, maybe book a session with an online therapist as a mediator, to talk this out -- perhaps you can align on like ... 5 simple meals a week which can be a mix of her cooking and take-out,  then one night of an elaborate meal that she wants to try out and leftovers from that the next day. \n\nThis way she can still plan one of her elaborate exciting meals, but it takes the pressure off if it's just once a week rather than a few nights a week.  \n\n\nGood luck!!",
            "I think there's more to this than just cooking.  Your fiancee takes on a different persona in the kitchen.  She doesn't want to become this persona on her own.  It's important that you be present.  Perhaps she likes being in command, bossing you around, a different power dynamic, etc.  It sounds like she is gaslighting you in order to maintain this arrangement.  It's all very bizarre.  Unless she's honest with her deeper motivations, you aren't going to get anywhere.  Definitely not about cooking.  Best of luck.",
            " Can you give some examples of the food that is crossing into \"hobby\" territory and taking 2 hours to make?",
            "So, I'm quite like your wife in that I love experimenting with different recipes. These can vary from 30 minutes to 3 hours of cooking (or more). I clean as I go because otherwise the clean up would be stupid. My expectation is that my husband cuts certain things or grabs me items from the fridge as I try to time everything. I enjoy his company while I cook so he usually plays the switch or PS Vita while I run around the kitchen. I hate people in the kitchen while I cook so this is a great compromise. I get snippy too when someone is in my way while cooking, so maybe that's part of her attitude? The general arrangement is I cook he cleans and that's worked out well for us. Otherwise most chores are split relatively evenly. \n\nI think chores in general are something that should be an ongoing discussion. Before Covid I would work at home and spend a few hours cleaning the entire house, which honestly I felt undervalued for. Now that we're both home less cleaning is done because why tf would I be the only one doing that? \n\nAnyways, verdict is NAH but keep up the communication and encourage your wife's hobby as home cooking is beneficial for everyone. No you don't have to be her Sous chef and enforce boundaries.",
            "It\u2019s her choice to make it elaborate. You\u2019ve made it very clear that you would be happy with a simple meal, therefore any time past what it would take for a simple meal is her choice to sacrifice. This is not chore time, she is trying to call her hobby chore time because you need to eat. If you did handy stuff around the house as your hobby which she benefits from you wouldn\u2019t be asking her to do more of the household chores to compensate your work. And she shouldn\u2019t ask you to sacrifice your time or take on more. You said you held your tongue but maybe you should point out that prior to her interest chores were fair and you guys did just fine without her cooking. It\u2019s her CHOICE and she\u2019s trying to make it yours.",
            "The solution is simple: \n\nOffer to switch chores. If she thinks just dinner is such a burdensome chore, and it's the equivalent of pretty much every other chore. Just switch with her. You will solely be responsible for dinner, and she will take care of every other chore.",
            "Sounds like if you want to divide up the chores, then dinner needs to go back to the way it was.  You could spend hours and hours cleaning every single millimetre of the house every day, but that it wasn't fair to her because that's more cleaning then she wants.",
            "I think having 1 time a week she does an elaborate cook and you help out is reasonable as a couple sacrifice. If she has it planned in advance and lets you know what the plan is early in the week. And you both commit to the spirit of the thing. If it's supposed to take 2 hours but actually takes 3, you don't leave after 2:05, but she should also do something less elaborate the next week that maybe only takes 1-1.5 hours to try to do a rough averaging out. And if she treats you poorly during it, she can fuck right off.\n\nCooking is a chore, but you don't get extra credit for spending 2-4 hours doing something that could be done in far less time if she wasn't doing it or her own enjoyment.\n\nYou've made it very clear that you're not getting nearly as much out of it as she is - either on the cooking or the eating side of the things. The problem isn't that you've got differing views, it's that she refuses to accept your perspective. And what's worse, she's expecting you to pick up the slack in all the other chores she's ignoring for the sake of her hobby. And she's treating you poorly when helping and sulking/getting upset when you had to leave for a Zoom you told her about, as the shit icing on the shit cake.\n\nYou should each be responsible for 3 meals a week and you can order in the last night or alternate weeks. If either of you wants to order in for the two of you on your night, that's fine. If she wants to spend 12 hours cooking to cover her 3 meals, that's up to her. But she gets credit for 3 meals, the same as you do for pressing some buttons on a delivery app, she doesn't get credit for superfluous time spent.\n\nThere's no good answer available here, because your girlfriend is being unreasonable and refuses to hear your very reasonable side of things. She's not only disrupted the status quo that you were both happy with, but she's now blaming you, being rude, calling you a bad feminist, and treating you pretty poorly all over her newfound connection with something neither of you gave two shits about a few months ago. That's a tough thing to deal with.",
            "If I want to make a meal, I will pick the meal  I WANT never mind what my hubbies preferences are and do it all myself. He will still enjoy it, because I made it my way, exactly how I want.  If we are planning and making a meal together (which I instigate) we will sort jobs and plan the cooking time together. HOWEVER, my least favorite thing is when my husband decides he's going to cook something and then while he is in the middle of it realizes he didn't plan correctly and now I have to save it. ugh. I didn't want to cook that, and that's what you wanted. Why do I have to stop watching my show to go help save the meal? I am getting him there, but he is also driven to make sure the finished food is perfect. (except that he forgets I need gravy for almost everything)",
            "I don't think you're wrong, but I can also see her logic there. It sounds like you might want to stay out of the kitchen and rightly so (I'm one of those cooks who gets controlling of how  people help and likely isn't fun for them), so you need a compromise. I don't think the compromise should be that she stops or changes what she's doing because she's enjoying it. I agree that meals should be on average maybe 30 mins? Sounds like there are leftovers so even if regular dinner takes longer than 30 mins, it hopefully evens out over the week. So 30 mins is the chore part. You can go to the store to pick up ingredients, pay for groceries, do dishes, etc. I would try to stick to picking up related tasks here rather than saying you'll be responsible for all the bathroom cleanup instead unless you just really despise all kitchen things. \n\nHow you do your chore isn't on the other person. For example, if you were responsible for cleaning the bathroom and every time you did, you double-washed all the grout and crevices with a toothbrush, that'd take a lot longer. And it's excessive and unnecessary to do when cleaning the bathroom every time. It's how you want to do it but you shouldn't hold that over your partner's head.  If she wants to do the equivalent of a \"deep clean\" with the way she cooks, that's her decision.\n\nFinally, this is a weird time for everyone. It's entirely possible that her interest in this will wane or at least settle down to more infrequent extravagant cooking.",

This post really triggered me because of how many times otherwise pleasant situations have turned into screaming matches because she has had to micromanage everything.

What if, now bear with me 'cause I'ma go all crazyballs, what if she agreed to only make an elaborate meal once or twice a week? The rest of the time, it can be something quick and simple or you order in/get takeout. She can plan it out and make a big deal out of it. \n\nAnd. Would you be willing to help out that one time a week, for a limited amount of time? Would she be okay with it if you agreed in advance, \"I can only help out for one hour and then I have to go feed and water my own hobbies.\"? What if your \"help\" was merely cleaning up as she cooks? \n\nTo me, cooking elaborate meals every single day is just overkill. Sometimes you throw together chicken and rice plus a salad, ya know? And it doesn't seem fair that you refuse to help because it's her \"hobby\" because you still gotta eat and she made something spectacular. \n\nI think y'all need to talk this through with an eye toward compromise.

Usually whoever \"worked harder\" gets a pass from cleaning the dishes. \n\nI actually don't know what else you can tell her that you didn't already but it feels like the problem is q bit deeper.

I\u2019m disheartened by the comments zoning into her calling you a bad feminist and interpreting it as a malicious attempt to hurt you\u2014it\u2019s likely not. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true, reasonable, or fair, but it also doesn\u2019t mean it was a choice to hurt you. She felt it and communicated it, and I think you should deal with it together.\n\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily just a hobby for your wife. This is likely a way to find some control and stimulation in her new life, which many of us are starved for. When I read your post I was struck by how many times you sat down with her just to say the same thing\u2014that you shouldn\u2019t have to devote so much time to HER hobby and that you\u2019d prefer simple foods. And yeah, sure. Eight hours or more a week is too much. But four? Or five? Or two scheduled nights? Or one elaborate meal and one simpler one? Or any number of practical solutions?\n\nIs that so far to go to support her mental health?\n\nAll I\u2019m saying is that your fianc\u00e9e has found a healthy hobby that you benefit from during a time of fear, instability, interrupted rhythms, and political chaos, and that being dismissive of it as solely her hobby undercuts the self-care she attempting that will ultimately be a benefit to your relationship\u2014because it\u2019s a benefit to her. You should want your fianc\u00e9e to be creatively stimulated and I hope you should want to compromise a little, even if you have to do some boundary talks on communication in the kitchen. Honestly, my partner has gotten into cooking during quarantine too, and as someone with an eating disorder and a lot of kitchen anxiety, he understands that sometimes I won\u2019t be able to help or eat his meals all the time. But if I told him that I honestly didn\u2019t care about his efforts and I\u2019d rather eat pizza, I think he\u2019d be crushed. Even if she\u2019s doing this for herself, for fun, you are at her mental finish line. She\u2019s excited to share with you. Factor that in when you communicate about this.\n\nI saw one commenter say that you guys seemed to be falling into keeping score in unhealthy ways. I\u2019d advise you to listen. Maybe have some more conversations that about solutions, instead of restating your feelings. If she\u2019s not feeling like hers are being heard or understood, it won\u2019t help her to know yours again.\n\nGood luck, I hope you can figure this out.",

(This is different if it\u2019s only when she cooks elaborately.)\n\nWhat\u2019s her love language? What\u2019s yours?

I'm not sure as I'm not witnessing the environment or dynamic but I know in the past when I've cooked more elaborate things with my ex I wanted it to be like something special for us not only to experience but do together. Maybe if you look at it like that it will be more fun? I'm not sure.\n\nAlso I wouldn't worry about it too much longer, when things go back to normal she probably wont be doing this as much. \n\nJust remind her she doesnt have to work so hard in the kitchen and maybe redirect it and say youd like to spend some quality time with her that is more relaxing and less technical? That way she still feels valued and then you can skirt around the whole cooking thing. Come up with something else to do together in the evenings instead and have simple meals then",

But even for my dad and myself who LOVE to cook it becomes a chore when youre the only one contributing and making the decisions. It is still a chore. If its just like... brownies or something on occasion thats a hobby. But cooking for you both every night *is* a chore regardless of how basic or complex the dishes are. \n\n\n\nAns recently I've been the only one in my house cleaning the kitchen and feeding the animals too. Its tiresome and frustrating. You shouldnt be doing everything, but you should cut her a little slack. If she's cooking every night it is more chore than hobby at that point. But you should consider therapy and tell her you don't want something extravagant all the time.\n\n\n\nJust as some insight, not that her response to you is right.",
            "I honestly feel like she's manipulating you with the whole feminism thing (and also the \"enjoying the fruits of her labor, wtf man?!). What you described has ZERO to do with supporting women and it's frankly quite shitty of her to abuse the label just because you're setting and keeping some healthy boundaries. \n\nThat's what you're doing: setting boundaries. You're helping in other ways and happy to pitch in for the amount of time you feel like dedicating to her hobby and yes,  I agree it is HER hobby. I love cooking, I do it a lot and a good evening meal never takes 2 hours to prepare... unless I'm cooking something elaborate or that takes longer to be ready but that's the exception to the rule, the once-every-week-or-two dish. \n\nPerhaps the real issue is that you two don't spend enough time together? Do you have something else, another hobby that you both share or could start anew? \n\nPlease keep your boundaries, they sound very reasonable and DO call her out on the feminism BS!!",

I hope you guys can find a compromise that works for you.",
            "You seem pretty reasoned in your thought process. Balance is usually the answer to these things. Do you think she'd accept a compromise of something like \"let's only do 1 complex meal a week which I will help you with\", with the others being something simple?

I don't HATE cooking and eating. \n\nI'd eat a HELLA elaborate meal in a restaurant. \n\nI just don't like the prep, cook time, clean up, put away..... the actual enjoyment of the meal is like 15% of the experience. And the meal is why I'm there. \n\nWhen I cook, it's pasta. Some southwestern or Tex-Mex something. I can honestly get pretty fucking gourmet with sandwiches. But it's still a sandwich. It's easy to prepare and clean up after. Chili, soups and stews. I get a lot of the veggie analogs so there are things like bbq \"chicken\" and roast \"beef\" made in the slow cooker or grilled. Sometimes a stir fry. \n\nI actually have a rotation of about 30-40 decent meals I prepare regularly. But I do those meals because they're well liked, they're fast and the cleanup is easy. \n\nI'm really not sure how y'all solve this one. \n\nDoes she have a friend or sibling who would also be into this? That way they can have their hobby time and you aren't a kitchen slave.",
            "Sounds like a compromise needs to be found. Maybe say you are willing to help her once every week or couple of weeks with an elaborate meal. Have her do solo less complex meals some days, you can provide takeout the others.",
            "I can relate to this. My bf though is into cooking as well. But we alternate with helping in the kitchen. If I do the cooking, he does the dishes and vice versa. And it has become a fun activity for us. For elaborate dishes, we do this on weekends since it's our rest days.",
            "Everyone has already covered most of what I'd say- the only thing I'd add is that maybe she's feeling a bit unappreciated. Cooking new things is hard, and the feeling of satisfaction when you do an amazing job is great- until you ask your SO how it tastes and they say Oh, yeah, its good. Excuse me, two hours slaving away in the kitchen (even if I enjoy it) deserves a bit more than \"Its good\". \n\nIts possible that shes roping you in so that you'll see how much effort it takes and appreciate it more. Partially, at least- I think she still might be kindof in over her head making something from scratch each day with no prep, so getting help is nice for her- plus she's \"including\" you in her hobby. I'm sure she has a cute (unrealistic) idea of you guys cooking together for a few hours each week. I'd write a letter or something, using \"I feel\" statements so she doesnt get as defensive- and if she is upset at not splitting the work equally when you are eating as well, tell her you understand and you have enjoyed her new recipes, but you dislike the actual act of cooking so much that you'd rather not benefit from the end result (food) if it also means you have to cook. Maybe once a week you can be willing to help, but the other nights you're going to order out so the pressure isn't on you to cook. Just stay calm and theres a good chance she'll match your energy rather than escalate. \n\nLastly, if this is the first big relationship issue like this, don't stress so much- quarantine has made things different for a lot of people and some people cope by channeling their energy elsewhere. This may be more than a hobby to her right now, it may be literally what kept her sane for a while there. I know I was stressed about not being able to help people when I wanted to- so I built some raised garden beds, a trellis, made a new pathway in the garden and started some side tables. Its a bit insane to assume I could keep that same pace after going back to work, but I tried for like a week (and my husband got roped into helping) because that was my normal, even after I got back to part time hours. There was an adjustment period going in and now another one while things start to pick back up- so be forgiving to both yourself and her for being a bit more on edge. Most of us are",
            "Omg I relate to this so much. My husband has recently picked up cooking as a hobby as well and loves it entirely too much. However he is very well aware that I would honestly be happier if he didn\u2019t cook and we just ate out all the time even though I enjoy his cooking. I enjoy relaxing WITH him and picking the items on the menu I like and eating off his plate and I don\u2019t like having to clean things the way he wants (certain things have to be washed by hand a certain way apparently). \n\nHer suggestion about chores is unfair because she\u2019s getting 1st pick of all the chores she likes best. You could easily pick half the meals as your chore and be way happier because you could simply buy takeout or cook a basic meal. And you definitely don\u2019t owe it to her to do the annoying bits of cooking (that I also hate). \n\nMan I feel you so much. \n\nBut my husband and I have worked this out really well actually. Every time he cooks I thank him. I go over recipes with him and talk about it with him and care about it and take a genuine interest in HIM cooking. But I\u2019m very honest and say I enjoy it more when we both go out and eat together and focus on each other instead of the process of cooking. You\u2019re doing this for you and not me, basically. Similarly, I know I spend longer cleaning the bathroom than he would and I know I\u2019m doing it for me because it bothers me a lot more when it\u2019s not super clean. We are also very aware that chores will never be 100% equal and contributions will never be 100% equal. \n\nEach person can just strive to love the other as hard as possible and treat them as well as possible without comparing score. I make more money (for now). He cooks. I do more laundry. He spends way more time with my family than I do with his. He takes care of my car when there are problems. I buy all the gifts for his family and mine and friends. I take care of all the financial planning. Relationships are built on a million acts of love that can\u2019t be quantified and it would be petty and hurtful to. \n\nAlso, she sounds rather controlling (which is not to say she\u2019s a bad person but just that she has a flaw). She wants to dictate how you guys handle meals and division of labor and how to cook and what to cook. Chores should be counted based on the benefit they bring to the other person not based on the time only. Diminish returns man! Maybe only the first half hour of each chore should count if she really wants to do a chores chart? \n\nAnyway I\u2019m getting long-winded. My advice would be to stop scorekeeping, show her you appreciate her more, be patient and kind, but tell her you\u2019re staying out of the her kitchen when she\u2019s in it and stick to it. And stay out of view. I run to the bedroom or find another chore to do when my husband tries to rope me in. Apparently if I\u2019m not in sight he doesn\u2019t ask me to help!",
            "I am in the EXACT same situation as you are with gender roles reversed.  So if I am not on board with my fiance's elaborate meals he can't really counter with a feminist rhetoric, but moreso that he's super action oriented and I'm lazy.

            "If it is something she is considering to be a chore instead of a fun hobby, and you don't particularly want to deal with it, then why does she feel the need to do it so often anyways?\nAnd if she's truly enjoying it, then it's fair for you to clean up after ,but not really for you to assume all the other chores. \n\nIn our house chores are divvied up by who hates what the most, and who doesn't mind it. My husband folds laundry, but we divide putting it in and pulling it out. I don't mind scrubbing the bathroom, he doesn't mind vacuming. I do most of the cooking, Mom does most of the kitchen cleaning and dishes.  And yes,cooking a big elaborate meal can be difficult and tiring. But there's no  one expecting or even particularly wanting her to do that several times a week. \n\n\nMaybe she can cut the fancy meals down to once a week, i e Sunday Dinners, to make it something special to look forward to.

A good stand mixer, processor that chops, shreds cheese and slices into thick pieces as well as very thin, a small chopper for when you don't really want a big processor, and a zoodler are HUGE timesavers (and wrist savers!l) as opposed to all the chopping, shredding, slicing, and mixing by hand.",

I don\u2019t really have any other advice for you than to just keep reiterating your point that you appreciate the meals but it\u2019s not your hobby and she shouldn\u2019t be making you participate in it.

Or maybe in regards to your relationships she feels she does more stuff for you than you do. \nI think she is transferring her emotions. \n\nMaybe ask her if she feels she is alone in some aspect.

He, on the other hand buys takeout when I don't want to cook and does the dishes 89 percent of the time. I do not expect him to help me because it was my decision to cook, and he could perfectly well just order us food if I didn't want to cook. Also I'd rather him leave me alone when I cook. \n\nTo me shes being selfish and blaming you for something you didn't ask for. I don't see her changing her mind. But maybe offer her one night a week to help, every Wednesday you will help out as bonding time. Otherwise let her know why you are busy and show her how you're still helping your \"couple\" while she's cooking. If you're working and you say it's to benefit your future together she'd be less likely to argue, because now you're both working for something beneficial to both of you.

I do 80% of our cooking (he cooks when he's fed up of doing dishes)\n\nI also started branching out and being more adventurous with food since lockdown began as I started working from home. However, I branch out maybe one day a week, both because its EFFORT and its expensive.\n\nI also do it on my day off so I know I've got adequate time to prep everything I need, and cook, and when my Fiance comes home dinner is ready for him (he works till 7pm)\n\nHe does the same thing, on his days off if he wants to cook something elaborate, he will. But he does it himself. He doesn't expect me to help out, sometimes I do but that's cause I like chopping veg and talking to him. \n\nIf your Fiance is getting THIS stressed out by cooking these meals then she's not doing it because she enjoys it. Is this a trigger point for her? Maybe from an old relationship or a parental influence where she's been told she's not making enough effort/never gunna keep a guy if she doesn't do more etc? It may have only come up now because she has more free time and feels obligated to do more proportionately?\n\nHonestly, I'd suggest couples counselling.

            "If she's looking to more evenly distribute the efforts of labour, then you should be expected to actually choose the meals you cook half the time.

It's not being ungrateful, it's just being economical. \n\nMaybe you could prepare a list of meals/tasks that you would be willing to do when preparing meals and find common ground there.\n\nI think you should also express that her controlling attitude makes the actual work aspect of cooking less enjoyable to you.

            "Question: Did she start doing this because of the pandemic? If she feels more comfortable eating at home, and has discovered that it is a lot healthier to make everything from scratch, then this kind of makes sense. Yes, you can use pre-made sauces and whip something up in 30 mins, but if you're avoiding certain ingredients, or don't live in an area with readily prepared fresh stuff from local farms, it's not at all uncommon for a scratch-made meal to take 2 hours. Some people would read this and agree that she is just getting the hang of adulting and her expectations are pretty reasonable. You may feel fine subsisting on take-out (where you can't control the ingredients and the incentive is toward making things sweeter or better tasting), or making quick stuff from processed grocery ingredients (ex. a premade pizza crust can be different from one made at home) but she may not feel that anymore.\n\nI think what might be the most helpful here, is sitting down and focusing instead on what you want to prioritize in your meals. If she really is trying to learn new culinary techniques, and you're her unwilling molecular gastronomy peon, sure. I'd agree it's a problem. But it sounds to me like she's trying to make a healthy lifestyle change and sees you as resisting this effort based on not wanting to contribute. If you can both agree on a criteria, then you can pick the recipes for a week and lead for a change. That might really give you a new perspective - either in how needless her complex recipes are, or in how much you're dismissing the true time commitment that comes with making homemade food.",

If you decide to make a meal that takes 30 minutes and she wants to go 2 hours then that's her choice but I don't think breaking it down into who does more hours really makes sense. \n\nIt should be an even split(or whatever split you want to agree to) on who does the cooking and then whatever they cook is up to them. \n\nMaybe you could come to an arrangement where a couple of nights you make something together(and I mean really together instead of you being a sous chef) and then you make meals one night and then she makes meals another.  \n\nI don't know your relationship so how you get this best conveyed to her is up in the air but I definitely think coming in with some ideas next time you discuss it will help.",

I say divide the food providing down the middle and then she would need to let you know if she feels like cooking on your days so if she decides she wants to cook, she can make less food and only for herself, while you can buy food for both of you and she can have the leftovers at lunch the following day, but you are still providing meals for 2 on your days.

If you decided your contribution to dinner would be providing the meat and vegetables. And that to do that you would get a rifle and go out hunting and do some tilling and plant a garden would this be counted as chore time or hobby time? \n\nHave you tried explaining that you really don't enjoy cooking but would like to spend time with her doing something you both enjoy? Maybe phrase it in such a way she doesn't take it as a personal rejection but just your dislike of cooking elaborate meals?",
            "A huge part of why I love cooking is precisely because others can enjoy the fruits of my labours. That really is the joy of cooking.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t enjoy that, cooking probably isn\u2019t for her.

            "I feel you. I do not enjoy cooking either, and especially don\u2019t enjoy when I try to help and it transpires in nit-picky arguments.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve tried to make your point and she\u2019s not seeing it. I will agree with some of the posts that state that maybe you should try talking to her about maybe doing the elaborate meals once a week, and offer to help, with the stipulation that she be a bit more understanding to the fact that you\u2019re doing this to support *her* hobby of cooking that you don\u2019t particularly enjoy... and to keep this in mind before she becomes snippy with you when you are providing the help. Explain to her that It\u2019s never going to be fun for you if she\u2019s rude to you the entire time you\u2019re trying to help, when cooking isn\u2019t something you actually care to do or enjoy doing.\n\nHobbies aren\u2019t really chores, and if cooking has become a chore to her.. she may need to dial it back a bit and focus on experimenting with making simpler/ less time consuming meals taste better than average?",

            "I\u2019m the cook in our household. I enjoy doing it. I like to try new dishes and things from around the world. My husband buys groceries more often than me and he always cleans up afterwards. I don\u2019t ask him to help. It isn\u2019t his thing. \n\nBut, now that I\u2019ve been doing it even more during COVID season, I\u2019ve found he\u2019s helping more and wanting to learn how to do things. Like how to hold a knife for more efficient chopping, or different ways to use various items. I always answer questions and let him help as much as he wants. My only real request is that he helps keep the dogs under control if they sense something they really think is tasty being done. \n\nSo we\u2019ve worked it out over time. Your wife seems to have a rather immature idea about the balance of household duties. In average dinner should be possible in under an hour, or at least with prep time under an hour. More elaborate things mean the sky is the limit. But if she sees it all as tit for tat, she isn\u2019t really understanding that it\u2019s a hobby for herself now. Imagine if you did the lawn care of your place and spent an entire Saturday outside working in the yard. Would she be upset if you said \u201chey, i worked outside for 14 hours Saturday mowing, gardening, clearing brush, and more. I think that counts for housework, so I\u2019d like you to do all the rest.\u201d She\u2019d tell you that you were out of line. \n\nMaybe try writing to her to express this in a way that makes all the points you need to make. Be sure you start and end on a positive note, but be frank with her, don\u2019t talk around it.",
            "I was disappointed I had to scroll so far down to find anyone actually offering any viewpoint.\n\nYou are not the asshole here for feeling how you feel.\n\n> I don't really enjoy cooking and see it as a chore to be avoided. I love food but there are other things I'd rather do with my time.\n\nThis is definitely mine and my partner's viewpoint and not unreasonable.\n\n> My fianc\u00e9e has decided to actually cook more and she has found she really enjoys it... so I've been benefitting as well.\n\nThis is great! I'm jealous of people that enjoy cooking because they get to enjoy such interesting meals! And given your relationship it's just a side-effect that you'll eat the same food.\n\n>  in return... I've been helping out by paying for take out on nights she doesn't want to cook as well as doing all the dishes and cleaning the counters, etc.\n\nThe correct balance. I'd say paying for takeout of you used to share the cost is maybe over and above, but definitely if she's cooking, you wash up. That's the classic division of labour.\n\n> her cooking experiments are elaborate and sometimes take two or more hours. So my entire evening is gone to these cooking endeavors and this happens multiple times a week. On top of that, she tends to order me around in the kitchen and can be a little rude.\n\nUnreasonable. She's allowed to want to cook things that take two hours but if you don't want to too then you're not getting the same enjoyment out of it. Being rude to you is just the shit icing on the cake.\n\n> As you can probably predict we had a fight about it.\n\nYou tried to communicate and she turns it into a fight.\n\n> She said that it wasn't fair that I was enjoying the fruits of her labor but not contributing, and that cooking took 2 hours but doing the dishes/cleaning only took half an hour.\n\nIt isn't your fault that she chose a hobby where the results (the food) is shared. And a half hour of dishes from on meal sounds like *a lot*. Saying you're \"enjoying the fruits of her labor\" is manipulative.\n\nAnd **a relationship isn't a competition!** I'm currently furloughed so I'm at home all day while my girlfriend works and I do *all* the household chores accordingly. But before that do you think we counted up the time each other spent on chores and compared it to make sure we were working as hard as each other? No! In a mature relationship if you see something that needs doing you just do it. \n\n> I told her that it was her decision to make very elaborate meals\n\nThat's pretty much the biggest point.\n\n> I actually bought/made some of my own meals on a few nights so I wasn't \"enjoying the fruits of her labor\"\n\nThis is beautiful. It feels almost petty but it made me grin!\n\n> Another time I ended up helping her but told her I needed to go to a videochat at 8 pm, and she got upset when I actually stopped helping to leave even though I'd told her beforehand.\n\nShe isn't being rational.\n\n> She retorted that it wasn't feminist of me to relegate the cooking to her and benefit from it without helping.\n\nThis made me really angry. There are women out there facing legitimate gender problems and she's trying to make this a feminist issue. It's disgustingly manipulative but it's so desperate and suggests she knows the weakness of her own position if she's clutching at that straw. She's saying it isn't feminist of you because that means you're no longer just arguing against her shitty behaviour - you're arguing against women and equal rights. Honestly without context this felt like it would be a big red flag for me.\n\n> she wanted to count ALL the time she spends cooking as \"chore time.\" So according to her ideal chore distribution, she spends 10+ hours cooking DINNER ONLY every week, which somehow leaves me with pretty much all the rest of the chores.\n\nAgain, massively unreasonable of her. What if you found a new love for tinkering with vacuum cleaners and spent 10+ hours repairing them and supercharging them and doing the most incredible vacuuming of your house? Do you think she'd accept that the rest of the chores are hers? Hell no.\n\nActually maybe you should do that. Electronics and engineering are fun! Spend as much time rebuilding etc. vacuum cleaners and vacuuming your house and that way you can insist the remaining chores are equally divided.\n\nOr, get into car mechanics. Soup up/mod your cars for hours, whinge at her whenever she drives or is a passenger in the car for using the fruits of your labour, and insist the remain chores are equally divided.\n\nOr painting, come to think about it! Spend 10 hours each *day* painting and then complain every time she looks at one of your pieces of art. Also it isn't fair that painting takes 10 hours a day but mixing your paints and cleaning your brushes for you only takes 2.\n\n> Am I actually being a bad feminist?\n\nNo, she is. The moment she tried to use it as a blanket argument-winner.\n\n____\n\nYou don't mention how much time you each spend working during the week and how much you each earn, which might throw balance one way or another, but over all she's being a massive asshole.\n\nIt's fine for her to have a hobby as long as it doesn't impact the household and what needs to be done (i.e. shopping, cleaning, chores, work, loving time together like cuddles and date nights etc.) gets done.\n\nThe few times I've baked I've eaten maybe 10% of the cake etc. and my *main enjoyment* was from seeing other people enjoy it! So it doesn't make sense to me that her hobby is cooking - a naturally social/sharing hobby, and then she's spiteful about you enjoying the food!\n\nAt every turn you've tried to have a mature discussion or find a constructive solution and she's refused to engage with you. She's been unfair and manipulative.\n\n**This is not worth losing your relationship over** but I say this to **HER** not you! By which I mean, her behaviour and the way she is acting could be a deal breaker and she needs an attitude adjustment pretty quickly because I think the relationship should be more important to her than this division of labour bullshit.\n\nYou are not being unreasonable.\n\nShe can spend as long on her **hobby** as she wants so long as other areas of your relationship and household are not being neglected.\n\nYour wants and needs are currently being neglected. She is not being a good partner.",

The only \"fair\" deal I can see you guys doing is simply decide each takes care of 50% of meals whichever way they like, to a minimum standard (no frozen pizza 3 days a week). I could see being annoyed if my partner didn't ever cook and I wanted to spend less on going out and eating healthier (I don't know about you but for us eating out is always less healthy than cooking). In that case it wouldn't be \"fair\" if she cooks on her nights and you only order take out. Cooking is a basic life skill that everyone should have to a minimum degree (know how to make a basic balanced meal, vary the ingredients so it's not too boring and season to taste). HOWEVER her choosing to make super elaborate meals is really her choice and as I'm sure you'd be happy with something simple it's really not your responsibility to help her with everything to an extent that it's taking over your evenings.

I would tell her she needs to plan out the meals in advance, and do maybe 2 elaborate meals a week, and anything more is her choice!

You dine like a king. But simpler food can  also be great, and instead of ending up spending so much time in the kitchen together, maybe you can suggest something else you can do (better to have something f specific as well). I'd also tell her that some days just doesn't go because of work, and this is kinda a luxury problem. I mean. She spends so much time, and I bet it's not just for herself, but to make you happy and feeling more useful.

Everything is a little more pressed due to the virus and lockdown and everything and I\u2019m sure when everything goes back to normal lots of these problems will die away with it, just try explaining in a calm way and maybe let her help you with one of your hobbies 1 a week too, I hope it works out :)",

If your partner's hobby has turned into a chore for you, it's time to work out a compromise.\n\nGrowing up, my SAHM mom of six made simple meals during the week. Sunday was the day when Dad took us to church and Mom stayed home to prepare a big meal with fancy dishes, and often guests.\n\nThe point is, the fancy, multi-dish meal that required participation from everyone was a limited event.\n\nThe other thing my mom did was wash dishes (or at least load the dishwasher if we had one) *as she went along.* Prep bowls and utensils can be washed quickly while prepping and assembling.  \n\nThat habit has the advantage of keeping the workspace neat and organized, so steps in the process don't become mentally overwhelming. It's like being at any job. If your workbench or desk or working vehicle is a mess, you can't find the tools you need, or they're dirty, or dull, or otherwise unsuitable for the next task.\n\nMaybe come to a compromise with your fiancee, that you'll help her do a more complicated process once a week, on one of your days off when you can *enjoy* spending the time and making the effort, instead of at the end of your workday when you really don't.\n\nI live with a housemate who works from home; I'm newly retired so I'm getting by just fine right now, but I make a point of A. not bothering him during the day, and B. we plan an enjoyable meal for the weekend when he's not stressed out and trying to decompress at the end of the day. \n\nThe other thing we do is meal-prep for the upcoming week. He prefers to have the same meals prepped for every day during the week *so he doesn't have to think about food while he's working.* \n\nI prefer to prep or have available a limited variety of ingredients so I can mix-and-match my meals during the week. It's all a matter of how we view our own eating habits, and that means that after he's done working for the day he can come into our common living area and we can chat and enjoy the time we do spend together. \n\nHe's not my partner, obviously, but the point is that we've talked about our living preferences and worked out a compromise that satisfies each of us, since we've been stuck inside the past few months.\n\nIt sounds like you and your fiancee need to do the same thing.",

And then you can help if she really needs it, but during the week you could both do simpler meals that take less time?\n\nMy boyfriend usually does the cooking and I usually sous chef, I don't mind it because I'd feel bad if I left him to do everything. However once or twice a week, we take on a more elaborate meal from a cookbook, just to try something new.

            "The problem I see is worry about the time spent on chores. It's one item on the list of many, not the time involved. Making a meal could be as simple as a bowl of cereal, so counting time and expecting equal time in other chores isn't the right attitude to have for a successful relationship. Chores are done either together or separate for the great good of the home. Mowing the yard is also just one chore. One can not do chores and think the other person \"owes\" them, that's the big issue. You do things because its a responsibility, not because you want someone to owe you. She chose to take on elaborate meals, and it is a great way for a relationship to grow as a team, though she should plan the meal with you and figure out what you both want and willing to do, together, she might not get as fancy a meal, but it was planned and worked on together. If she wants a full bore fancy meal, fine, but that's her choice, just check her attitude at the door and do it out of love for you and enjoy her hobby with no conditions of being owed. An attitude like that is a sure fire failure to a successful relationship.",

I think that she sees your benefit out of her cooking is that you get to eat it. The original compromise of doing equal amount of said chores was a great idea, until she tried to pass off her enjoyment of cooking elaborate meals as a chore. if it was a chore she wouldn't want to do it in the first place. In return you could order takeout or eat something else. If she wants to be manipulative and bring feminist issues into the argument and she assigned the role of \"cook\" onto herself, then she should eat her food her self.\n\nWhy contribute to helping her cook or doing extra household chores, if you're not \"enjoying the fruits of her labor\"?",

Say that you can do 3 each and on the 7th you can alternate. So basically on the nights that are yours you just have to make sure you are both fed. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s something quick or something involved or a take out. The chore is complete.\n\nThe same as saying that whoever does the grocery shopping. One might choose to go out to get the eggs from a local farm, the meat from a local butcher, go milk a bloody cow themselves and then go to the river with a fishing rod and catch some salmon while the other just does an online shop and has it delivered. Doesn\u2019t matter as long as the end result means that there is food in the fridge!\n\nMaybe if a conversation doesn\u2019t work then take up fishing and berry collecting and say that you are collecting food for 20 hours per week and don\u2019t have time for the other chores as you are ensuring the food supply is coming and if you decide to do it in an elaborate way then that\u2019s your business.",
            "Some points you could bring up to her:\n\n1. A meal is a meal. I can be done in 30-60 minutes max. If she chooses to spend way more time enjoying that newfound hobby of hers, or if she wants to bake bread that takes the entire day, and some cookies after that, then good for her, but any time over 30-60 mins per day should not count towards \"chore time\". Otherwise, you could get a newfound hobby for yourself, such as powerwashing, or gardening or whatever. Would that count towards chore time as well? What if you were doing it 2 or 4, or even 8 hours per day? When would the chores get done?\n2. When someone helps, in the kitchen or anywhere else, you say 'thank you'. Being bitchy when someone helps you is not a good look.\n3. The best way to divide chore time is to rotate. She thinks that when she cooks you should do more? Ok, next week you will order out (since it has the same outcome as her cooking), and you will have to do the chores she did this week, but in return she will have to take over the chores you did this week. Would she like that? Nuuuu? Then she should learn to negotiate fairly...",

If you address the rudeness and your disinterest in helping with the cooking, what has worked for me is try and keep the conversation away from the cooking and keep it to just the attitude.  Tell her you're happy to help but want to be her partner in it, not her sous chef.  She may be feeling like feeding the family is an obligation that *should* be shared and helping prep is the least you can do.  Or maybe you can see if she'd be willing to teach you and share the prep responsibilities together.  Maybe giving her the role of teacher will help switch her mindset to a more helpful one.

            "I am a hobby cook with a non-cook male partner, and we went through a similar process of arguments and negotiation and misunderstandings. I am one to spend several hours making complex meals, he is one to survive off of carrots and hummus and toast. I resented that he didn\u2019t want to help, he resented that I generated so many dishes for him to clean and that he had to either 1. Eat my fancy food and get the business about him \u201cenjoying the fruits of my labor\u201d and not helping or 2. Choose carrots and hummus over my food and thus insult me.\n\nThe solution: we have designated \u201cday-to-day cooking days\u201d and designated \u201chobby cooking days\u201d. Day-to-day cooking involves simple meals that take 30-45 minutes to put together: stir-fry, grilled chicken and vegetables, grain bowls, etc. These we share responsibility for, because we both require food on a daily basis. I still do most of the labor for these meals because I am good at it and enjoy it, but on these nights, if I ask him to come in and help me chop something or stir something, he does it and doesn\u2019t get to complain. We then do the dishes and clean up together after we eat.\n\nOn designated \u201chobby cooking days\u201d, everything that happens is my responsibility and my choice. I can go all out and spend as long as I want to in the kitchen. I have zero expectation that he will help me or participate in any way. I do it purely for my own enjoyment of the process and for the pride I feel when I present a beautiful meal to him and/or friends. He always does the dishes on my hobby cooking days, but that\u2019s more a gesture of gratitude from him rather than an obligation.

Sort by category and subtract it out. If you spent 1 hour helping total (prepping and dishes), she should cook alone afterwords. If you want to eat at 7, she gives you a list of things to chop and ingredients to measure at 5. You leave it on the counter for her and your work is done. If she wants to spent 2 more hours pitter-pattering in the kitchen, she can. \n\nCooking has a lot of prep work before the actual cooking can begin. I assume she enjoys the actual cooking part, using her stove and all that. If you spent 20-30 minutes preparing her station, that would help a lot in the meal process and add to your chore work load  in a reasonable way. You chop the carrots and get the half cup of milk out. She does the cooking. No one gets yelled at in the kitchen. Or yelled at out of it, hopefully.\n\nIf no compromise is reached, y\u2019all need an outside opinion. I feel you\u2019re coming at this more logically. She needs a therapist, friend, or family member to help her see reason. She doesn\u2019t value your opinion on this and won\u2019t compromise.",
            "I hope you get to see this comment as it's already 450 deep.  Check out Jamie Olivers' 5 Ingredient Recipes.  It's available in television or print format, and is wonderful.  The meals taste terrific, require very little in the way of shopping, present beautifully, and will significantly reduce the actual time she takes to prepare a wonderful meal.\n\nShe probably won't want to utilize these recipes every single day (although one certainly could), but this may help her to feel as though she's still preparing very nice meals and enjoying doing so, while simultaneously reducing her overall time in the kitchen.\n\nAlso, for what it's worth: as her cutting and chopping skills improve, she'll likely need less and less help as she learns to balance what to prep when.  Cooking part of one item while prepping the next is something amateur cooks often struggle with initially as they're nervous they may not finish the current step in time.\n\nGood luck!",
            "My ex used to pull something similar to this. She hardly did a thing around the house so most of the chores fell on my shoulders. Every so often I would put my foot down and say \u2018right WE need to get this house sorted\u2019, to which she would readily agree. She would then proceed to bake cakes or polish her crystal collection for the next hour or so while I vacuumed and dusted the house from top to bottom. It was supposed to look like she was helping when in reality she was just indulging her hobbies while I did all the drudgery.",
            "One of the few times my ex and I fought was about something similar to this. We distributed tasks so when one of us cooked, the other would do the dishes and vice versa. Except I did the dishes while he cooked/after dinner and he would let them pile up to do it all at once a couple days later. This pissed me off because of I wanted to cook something else in the meantime, I had to do the dishes he should have done. \nAnd this did make me feel devalued and like I was being treated as a maid/had to do all the work to feed us both, even if I knew he sincerely did have the intention of doing the dishes eventually. \nSo thy said, I get where your fianc\u00e9e is coming from, however I think you\u2019re doing your part of the agreement. As long as you\u2019re doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen, regardless of how long it takes you, it\u2019s your part of the deal. \nI guess it's worth reminding her how much you appreciate her cooking and how you don\u2019t see it as her responsibility and she doesn\u2019t have to worry about providing food If she doesn\u2019t feel like cooking. And that you\u2019re happy to clean up if she does feel like it. \nOverall, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the bad guy or anti-feminist (and I\u2019m always screaming about feminism), and I think she needs to be more understanding and respectful of your time/hobbies as you seem to have been of hers.",
            "I don\u2019t have advise for you unfortunately, but I want to say you are not in the wrong here. You are not being a bad feminist, she is, perhaps unintentionally, using feminism to manipulate you. It certainly doesn\u2019t sound like you finish work and expect to her to have home cooked a meal for you.",
            "About needing your help in the kitchen: it takes time to learn how to do things properly. A *very* important thing in cooking is PLANING, completely necessary every time as it will spare your running around the kitchen and lots of your time. You should take out all of your ingredients beforehand and if whatever you are preparing will leave you no time in between, you should also prepare ahead anything you can like chopping parsley or whatever. I usually make a plan out of cooking, I put on a podcast and spend an average of two hours on elaborate meals/pastries, doing the dishes as I go along and I end up with little to no dishes and an amazing meal to eat. While cooking you usually have dead time while something is baking or boiling or whatever that you should use to wash your stuff or prepare components of whatever you are cooking that you'll need later. \n\nAs to the last part, I am a feminist and my hobby is cooking since I can remember. I can see how she can feel touchy about her doing all the cooking, but if neither of you used to cook then it's totally fine if you choose not to as it is her hobby and not yours. I mean, you wouldn't force her to, I dont know, make furniture with you if you decided to do it and she hated it would you? Even though she would benefit from it. Yes, you eat everyday, but if you make it up to her with other meals (bought or not) in my opinion it should be fine. Talk about it! And really, planing ahead will do wonders about time and autonomy.",
            "She\u2019ll come full circle, hopefully sooner than later.  There is a sense of accomplishment when pulling off that elaborate meal.  Is she hinting at \u201cterrine en croute\u201d yet?  Go camping if she is...\n\nAll new cooks go through this.  Eventually they come back to realize simplicity is key.\n\nSome of the best and most famous food in the world is really simple, it has more to do with technique.  Think American BBQ, Spanish Paella, Mexican taco\u2019s, Brazilian Feijoada, French Steak au Poivre con Frites, Moroccan Tangine etc.\n\nSome of these do take time, but not much time in preparation.  \n\nPerhaps you can encourage her in that direction?  Possibly buy her a piece of equipment to \u201chelp\u201d her? Maybe its a really nice knife or a Le Crouset pot or an Instapot even (we love ours).  So you are encouraging her, but encouraging her to better utilize her time (and not yours).\n\nI made a great babaganoush and roasted chicken yesterday.  The babaganoush is roasted eggplant, tahini, lemon, s+p at its simplest.  I roasted some chicken thighs with sundried tomatoes, kalamata olives and feta, left over from a Greek salad the night before.\n\nYou could maybe help her map out the weeks meals to best utilize products.  Things like buying a pre-roasted chicken saves me a ton of time and is just as good as roasting it myself.  I will then make stock with the leftovers and use that over the next few days.",
            "This is easily solved by taking turns cooking. \u201cI don\u2019t like it\u201d is a piss-poor reason.  Offer to cook twice a week (not takeout). It doesn\u2019t have to be elaborate. Look up recipes with \u201ceasy\u201d in the title. Cooking food is something people do.",
            "Sounds like she doesn\u2019t put any real effort into mise en place so she\u2019s relying on you. If she\u2019s asking you to chop, saut\u00e9s, do other shit like that in the middle of a meal then her preparation is awful and you can probably taste it in \u201cthe fruits of her labor\u201d. I cook elaborate meals all week long because I enjoy it and my family enjoys them. Preparation usually starts long before (sometimes a day or two) I actually start cooking so my meals don\u2019t take 2-3 hours. But I do the prep work at a causal pace that doesn\u2019t interfere with normal life responsibilities and I clean as I cook so I don\u2019t have a sink overflowing with dishes. Sounds like she needs to learn the basics.",
            "I cook and my wife cleans up.  I like elaborate meals and she often wants something very simple.  We don't begrudge each others preferences, but I'm not going to get mad at her for not helping with something I started. \n\nPerhaps you could move what you are doing to the kitchen table where she can interact with you but you still don't waste your evening doing something you don't like.",
            "You can't go by time. What may take her two hours might take a more experienced cook one. There are many recipes (cookbooks and shows) dedicated to 5-10-15 minute meals, or other ways to make shortcuts. \n\nIt does sound like she is lonely though. Cooking can be a pretty lonely experience, especially if you're spending hours by yourself in the kitchen. \n\nBut if you want her to continue after this is over  maybe consider getting her some tools to get the prep/cooking done faster. A food processor, a mandoline, maybe suggest a meal you like that's quick and show her you like those just as much. Maybe suggest the elaborate meals happen once a week when you have time to help. \n\nConsider yourself lucky. She could have picked any number of other new hobbies that you wouldn't reap any benefit from at all.",
            "the feminist angle is horseshit. you *are*, in fact, dividing the labor between the two of you evenly by doing the dishes after she cooks (though, if you are eating it, i hope youre not ignoring the task and expecting her to ask you to do it; it should be assumed that if shes doing most of the cooking, youll be doing most of the cleaning). its not your fault that she chooses elaborate recipes that require long cooking time or two people.\n\nhowever, i think the issue is that shes expecting you to do more with the cooking because youre both eating it. i think you need to sit down with her and tell her that youre fine with helping out with the cooking from time to time, but its a chore for you, and if shes making something more elaborate and needs your help cooking, she needs to, you know, ask, instead of just demanding you help. maybe offer to pay for ingredients as well. you want to support her in something she enjoys, but its not an activity you enjoy, period. \n\nalso, tell her that she doesnt actually have to make elaborate meals if she thinks theyre too much work; youre happy with simple home-cooked meals or just ordering out.",
            "I don\u2019t know how wildly committed she is to experimenting, but if money isn\u2019t a problem I\u2019d actually recommend doing a meal subscription service like HelloFresh or Blue Apron. That way she\u2019s cooking new things but they\u2019re smaller time commitments and she won\u2019t feel so stressed by doing the prep work solo. We started doing them in our household because my partner expressed an interest in cooking more and it\u2019s been amazing. I only help when something he\u2019s doing catches my interest. We even made a little cookbook from all the recipe cards we get. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, it sounds like you\u2019re being a great partner here.",
            "Honestly? Keep making separate meals until the message sticks.\n\nI totally get this because I am just like your fiance. I LOVE cooking. We have like 40 different kitchen gadgets. My husband is more than happy to be involved (and even initiates) some stuff like making crepes or home-made pasta from scratch. But those are like, weekend type projects for us.\n\nShe has to be realistic and realize that cooking 2 hours every day isn't anyone's normal definition of cooking. She definitely is making it her hobby and it's really manipulative of her to start to throw the gender conversation out there, for a choice she made.\n\nTell her, flat out, you don't care if she cooks or not. She can stop tomorrow, you don't care. You can continue your old habits of getting take out, or cooking simple meals. If she continues to cook, you love and appreciate it, but you will be eating your OWN meals so you do not take \"advantage\" of her labor (and that includes her washing her own dishes, and you washing your own dishes). Yes, seriously stick to this.\n\nWhat is happening is that your fiance is being the sexist one. She has fallen for the trap that's sold to her through rom-coms and trash TV where the man of the house just absolutely swoooons over the wife's cooking and blahblahblah. SHE PUT HERSELF IN THIS GENDER ROLE! And she is DEMANDING you play your \"manly\" part of the stereotype! I strongly STRONGLY recommend you call her out on this, before you get married. Have seen this type of hypocritical person before, and it's the tip of the iceberg for what could potentially lie beneath.",
            "I\u2019ve just recently gotten into cooking as a hobby as well, however sometimes my boyfriend comes over and I ask him to cook with me. This is precisely because for me, cooking together is an intimate experience. I already think making food for someone is a real act of love and care, to do it together, to me, means to look after each other. That\u2019s what I get out of cooking with my boyfriend. I definitely think this situation is a little more complicated than that, but your girlfriend may want something similar.\n\nNow, you don\u2019t like cooking and you don\u2019t want to cook. That\u2019s perfectly fine! But you may want to see if you can find something intimate you can do together (besides sex) that you both enjoy. What she may be wanting is just some romantic quality time. A personal favorite of mine is showering together (no sex, just washing each other). Saves on water, too.",
            "It sounds like an uncomfortable household to start with if there\u2019s dissension over how much you\u2019re contributing to something she generally likes to do. If, say, shopping and cleanup is on your plate, and cooking on nights you don\u2019t order in is on hers, the. She\u2019s free to plan meals that are as simple or as elaborate as she chooses as long as you\u2019re not complaining about her choices. Which you\u2019re clearly not. \n\nI\u2019d be much more concerned about the manipulation of her insinuating you\u2019re sexist just because she can\u2019t get you to do what she wants. That\u2019s fucked up.",
            "I don't feel like anyone is really answering your question, so I will. You have gone above and beyond to both appreciate and help out with what has gone from merely cooking meals to an elaborate, time consuming hobby. You're doing all the cleaning up and it doesn't matter it only takes 30 minutes to her 2 hours spent cooking. You don't need to do anything more, but if she keeps on with her nonsense, I'd schedule a session with a couples counselor to work through it.   \n\n\nPS I am a woman and a feminist and I'd be absolutely thrilled if my partner did all the cleanup after I made her meals. Instead, I shop for the food, prepare the food, wash the dishes, clean the kitchen. My wife puts the dishes away. Your wife is lucky.",
            "My girlfriend and I are the same way, but I set the expectation up front that I didn't NEED the cooking. She actually cleans afterwards, too. Because it's her thing, not mine. Yes, I enjoy the fruits of her labor. And I thank her every meal and check in with her every couple of weeks to make sure that she doesn't feel like it's unfair. But it's understood that I can go get my own food as soon as she doesn't like it. I'm not depending on her, nor do I want to.  \n\n\nI WILL say one thing that opening up my mind a little bit, though. This is assuming the two of you want kids one day (otherwise ignore). When we have kids, it IS going to be a bit of a chore. And when we have kids, I WILL want them to eat quality (though not elaborate) home-cooked food. So I am prepared to help with cooking when that happens, and I am also sensitive to the fact that this is a transition, and that as our relationship goes on, I will be monitoring and gradually shift from viewing her as \"cooking because it's her hobby\" to \"cooking for the family, for the home\" in which case I do view it more as a chore-type contribution.",
            "You sound like an ass tbh",
            "I agree with the others, I think she is being unreasonable but that there must be some underlying issues:\n\n- maybe she is using cooking as a coping mechanism for anxiety/stress and it gives her a sense of \"control\" and acheivment in this lockdown period but she isn't addressing these root issues? \n\n- maybe she wanted cooking to your \"thing\" as a couple? Maybe she is seeking validation/quality time? It would be good to voice that you really do want to spend time with her after work and brain storm some ideas but cooking is just not it for you. \n\nI'm sure talking about the above would be really productive. Also doing the \"love languages\" quiz together would be nice to get a better understanding of one another's needs. If it is verbal affirmation and quality time she is craving, you can definently provide this but it doesn't need to be revolved around cooking. \n\nAs someone who is the main cook in the house because it is my hobby/passion I have the following suggestions to make her life easier: \n\n- How about using a online service which provides weekly deliveries with new recipes with all the required ingredients included? This would save alot of time on researching recipes/ finding the correct ingredients in stores. She would still get the same excitement of trying new recipes but with reduced stress/time. \n\n- if she is totally not up for the above. What I do is make sure I have a weekly menu with a list of ingredients on my shopping list. It means that I have one allotted time to find recipes which I then save to use for the whole week. When things run out I make note of it for the next shopping round. She can get things that make cooking easier: pre-chopped veggies (pre-chopped onions is a big help), garlic and ginger paste, white lasagne sauce /  tomato sauces / cooking sauces, pre-shredded cheeses, pizza bases which then she can add toppings to add her personal touch. She doesn't need to do every single thing from scratch but can still make it her own and it can still be healthy. A good quality rice cooker is also a big help, using easy cook basmati rice. You can point out that all restaurants have some level of pre-prep to make quality meals so it isn't cheating. \n\n- A big one: bulk cooking. She can make a nice meal and freeze some of it.\n\nAll the best OP!",
            "A couple of thoughts:   \n\n\n1. This is HER hobby. Not yours. If you don't enjoy helping or cooking with her, then don't. And no, you don't have to \"square\" it up with cleaning or some such stuff. If your hobby is stamp collecting would you order her to help you and make her do other chores when she refused?   \n\n2. The other rule that can help this is the old \"treat your partner/family in terms of general politeness at least as well as how you would treat a stranger.\"   \n\n\nIt seems something got lost her between her\"hobby\" and the fact that both of you have to eat. She sounds very transactional: If I do this (\"cooking\") then you need to help me or do other chores? Is she very transactional in other ways? Does she always expect something in return for doing something?   \n\n\nDo you do things for her without expecting anything in return?   \n\n\nDo you see my point? Partners do things for each other because they love each other and they want to do things for each other. I think you should tell her you love her cooking, you love that she found a great new hobby but you're not into it as far as being her helper and especially getting yelled at an ordered all around.   \n\n\nRelationships are filled with things we do for our partners because we love them and want them to be happy. It's not a tit for tat. I do this so you must do that.",
            "My mother loves to cook, but doesn\u2019t love to cook all the time. Perhaps you two can come to an agreement that she only cooks these elaborate meals on certain days that you don\u2019t mind helping out, like on Wednesdays and Fridays, for example. Though this should all be under the condition that she works on her attitude.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair for her to pick up a hobby that you aren\u2019t super fond of and force it on you, and then try to turn it around and make it a chore instead.",
            "NTA\n\nThis would drive me up the wall as well.\n\nWhen it comes to chore distribution, only \"average cooking time\" should be applied to her side of the chore ledger.\n\nHow long does a normal meal take to make in your household? 30 mins? 1 hour? Split the difference and make it 45 mins?\n\nThat's how much she should be able to put on her side of the chore list. All extra cooking effort falls firmly in the hobby bucket.\n\nI'm a feminist and her argument regarding that makes no sense. \n\nFrom the other side of the stereotypical chore gender divide, it would be the same as you suddenly deciding that you loved gardening (or similar). Suddenly building a giant garden and expecting her to help out with the garden, weeding and what not,  for several hours every day, and wanting all of your garden time to count against your chore list.\n\nIt may help to phrase it in those terms, to help her understand how unreasonable she's being. Does she want to spend 2+ hours of her own day, every day, pulling weeds, planting plants and building raised planter beds?  (In addition to the 2+ hours of cooking she needs to do that night)  If she actually likes gardening, substitute [chore she doesn't like] instead.\n\nElaborate meals and gardens aren't bad things within themselves. But when they represent a significant investment (time/money etc) for both partners, then they need to happen with both partners' consent.\n\nMy father has an enormous garden. Every year it gets expanded further. More land involved. More trees planted. More flowers. More random statues. More upkeep required...\n\nBUT. He has his partner's support. She loves the garden and loves to help maintain it.\n\nThat's not the case with you guys.\n\nI'm not sure why your fianc\u00e9e is being so stubborn about this. Or why she's taken such an illogical position in the first place. Or why she's so unwilling to take your opinions and comfort into account. Or what the best way forwards is.\n\nBut I do think it's important that you don't give in. Any resolution has to be reasonable for both sides, and her current proposal isn't.\n\nSo where to from here?\n\nIt honestly could be an idea to involve a third party and get some couples counselling. If you've got a great relationship otherwise, then being able to talk it out with an occasional reality check from someone else might help.\n\nIn the meantime, with regard to chores. Maybe... work out a compromise that you'd be happy with (even if she's not) and stick to that until you can get in to see the therapist.\n\nDefinitely put the wedding on hold (even if only in your head) until it's sorted out.\n\nBecause a wedding ring isn't going to fix this issue.",
            "I think you need to agree to pitch in as a sous chef about half the time. You shouldn't be counting hours in order to distribute chores - the fact of the matter is that she wants nice meals for the family, and so should you! It's a bit of a cop out to say that you would prefer a simple meal. I would prefer a lot of simpler things in my household, but my wife has helped us create a beautiful home (along with beautiful meals). I definitely benefit from it. Even though it is not my passion, it is my responsibility to help out in some way or another.

If we both made the meal maybe it wouldn't feel so one sided. But right now I am always bummed because no one ever makes me a home cooked meal. \n\nWe have four kids. We can't afford to get takeout very often because takeout for 6 people is usually pretty expensive. If you guys ever want to have kids this is a good thing to figure out now. \n\nBut yeah.

The fiancee is a woman with agency, she is choosing to use her agency to plan these elaborate cooking projects. You cant reasonably expect someone to want to set aside 8+ hours a week of their free time to an activity they don\u2019t want to participate in.

It has never felt like a chore, and the only time it's considered as such is when I'm baking at my husband's request for his family or customers.\n\n\n\n\nIf her hobby was knitting would she be upset if you didn't hold the yarn for her?

            "So my husband and I definitely ran into this issue when we first started living together. I realized that we're both exhausted after a long day of work and spending hours in the kitchen prepping, cooking, cleaning would lead straight into bed time and that wasn't good for either of us.  So we started meal prepping so during the week we had food that just had to be thrown in a pan and gotten ready. \n\nWe would still end up having really nice, sort of fancy food during the week but all the vegetables got chopped on the weekend, if meat had to be browned, shredded, marinaded; sauces made, dressing etc (basically anything that could be prepped on the weekend but not in the heat and eat type way) we would do all that on a half day on the weekend.  We would keep it fun and low-key. Music, wine, chatting, goofing off while still cooking and getting ready for the week. Then during the week everything just had to be put together and served - done under 30 minutes and hardly any dishes bc they were done on the weekend.\n\nAsk her if she wants to meal prep and say you can do x amount of things for x amount of time.  It sounds like the issue if you don't know how long it will take and it eats into your evening when you might have had other things planned. It also sounds like she's a bit bossy in the kitchen which I totally get because I am that way as well. \n\nAnother option is maybe ask her if she wants to do large elaborate meals to do them on the weekend instead of during the work week. You can offer to make some of the more simpler meals or do take out and maybe see if she can do simpler meals during the week. \n\nGood luck. You will figure it out!",

It's not like you are forcing her to do these things and are willing to buy takeout or make something easy if she doesn't want to.

Consider it a date night with music, wine, and the fun is trying a new dinner together and learning a new skill. The rest of the meal responsibility can be divided evenly with each of you totally responsible for your specific nights whether that means you\u2019re cooking completely solo or ordering take out. She can experiment with quicker, simpler meals these nights and you can do clean up, which usually is an equivalent time/effort. This set-up worked pretty well for me in the past.

Then ask what you could do to pull your weight without having to be in the kitchen helping for 2 hrs. Just be honest and say while you enjoy the time with her you don't like the act of cooking itself. Who knows maybe you could actually trade off. You help her cook twice a week and she helps you do something you like twice a week. Marriage is all about finding a balance that suits you both.",
            "My parents are like this in reverse - my mom sees cooking as a chore but my dad absolutely loves it, will pick incredibly complex recipes and spend hours in the kitchen. The compromise you originally had (you doing the cleaning when she cooks) has worked for them for.... 30 years.\n\nIt\u2019s not working for you two because she doesn\u2019t like cooking. If it was something she enjoyed that much, saw as a passion or hobby, then it wouldn\u2019t count towards her chore time. It might be helpful to have a conversation with her about what her motivation is to cook like this. COVID has made us all a little crazy and she might just be channeling it really strongly into cooking",
            "Idk how possible this is, but maybe you could gift her a cooking class for a few months? 1-2 nights a week where she can go nuts and she won\u2019t need you to help her. You figure out dinner for yourself. Do one night a week that\u2019s takeout/fast food, one that\u2019s simple that maybe you take care of, stir fry night for example, and 1 night where you too can cook together bc maybe she enjoys that time with you. But definitely express how her being bossy and rude to you is not ok",
            "I cringed when I read what you said to her. \n\nMaybe try something along the lines of \"hey OPs missus, I really love that cooking brings you joy, but it doesn't bring me joy so whilst I support your new hobby, and enjoy eating with you, I find cooking to be pretty stressful. I'd LOVE it if we could find a hobby that we both enjoy so we can do that together instead, because I also really love doing things with you! If you'd rather I figure out my own food, that's understandable but I'd much rather eat what you cook!\"\n\nPersonally I'd respond so much better to something that didn't feel like an attack or focus on how I was being bossy. Even if I WAS being bossy. \n\nAs for the feminist comment, sure.. if you were expecting her to cook every night I'd get that. But you're willing to pay for takeaway. So many suggest she takes care of dinner 3-4 nights per week, and you take care of it the other nights. In your way, on your terms :)",
            "you can buy things prepped / chopped much more common in grocery stores now.   \n\n\nespecially if money not an issue",
            "From the sounds of it, she's being selfish. \n\nIt's HER hobby and decision to make elaborate meals. I've been there, done that, but I never expected my roommates to help or pay for the (pricey) ingredient because it was MY hobby even if I shared the fruits of my labor.\n\nI think you're doing more than your share by cleaning up afterwards. \n\nMaybe if she continues to cook, suggest recipes you wouldn't mind preparing yourself to her, so she can maybe see the difference between \"cooking to eat\" vs \"cooking as a hobby.\"",
            "I feel like this is a very common thing I've been seeing. My sister is like your partner. She was laid off and stays home. She begins cooking around 12pm to 3pm depending on the dish and it takes around 2 hours. My BIL comes home and she is really pissy. If he asks something about the food, she gets even more mad and tells him she ain't ever gonna cook again or that he can try cooking all day. Is she laid off? Could be the uncertainty stress of when things will be back to normal. \n\nEven though this has become her hobby, does she feel like she needs to cook every day? Because if her hobby becomes a necessary task to do, she could be resenting that she has to spend all this time cooking since she is the one not working. Once a hobby feels like a chore, it no longer is a hobby. Does it feel like a chore for her to cook now?\n\nSuggest she take something else up. She can trying sewing, other forms of arts and crafts. Something that really only needs ONE person to do it. Reiterate that you appreciate her efforts on cooking and it's been great seeing her try different things. But because you can't spend as much time with cooking, perhaps she can try something more solo that way she doesnt have to worry about what dinner would be all the time. And that you can cook too so that she can focus on another hobby, try out something new for the time being. \n\nCuz from the sound of her, it really sounds like she lost her passion/eagerness to cook when she is snappy, pissy, and making jabs at you (the feminist comment that was purely said to hurt you).",
            "First, a suggestion:  Can she get pre-prepped ingredients? Some grocery stores have pre chopped carrots, mirepoix, stuff like that. \n\nOr if you have the money, once covid is out of the picture, get a chef school student to come in a couple of days a week. \n\nSecond, her insistence you need to help or you\u2019re un feminist for making her do all the cooking:  She is creating extra work, taking it on without your insistence or even really desire, and then complaining about it. \n\nThis is not feminist. This may even be loan sharking. You\u2019re willing to participate, but not to dedicate yourself to it the way she does. \n\nIf you were to take on the job of housekeeping but insisted it meant a deep clean every week, change of linens and towels twice a week, rotating summer and winter rugs, curtains and shades, redesigning and painting rooms and rearranging the furniture constantly, and so on, and this with all the supporting tasks like shopping and planning ended up taking six hours a day, would that absolve you of any other chores?  No. Expanding one chore doesn\u2019t get you out of others.",
            "What concerns me here is that she is inherently saying that your time isn\u2019t as valuable as hers. \n\nI know that sounds harsh, but hear me out-  what if you wanted to play video games for 2 hours every night and  insisted that she join you? \n\nBy cleaning, in my book, you\u2019re doing the hardest part (I love to cook, so I get that cooking isn\u2019t always easy.) \n\nI know her argument is that you eat the food she\u2019s prepared. That\u2019s a pretty flimsy excuse, if you ask me.  You\u2019re willing to cook, or buy a meal, so these elaborate ones are on her.  \n\nI\u2019m not concerned at all about her choice of hobby, but expecting someone to \u201cpull their weight\u201d in what is a totally optional activity is worrisome.",
            "I think it\u2019s fair that you don\u2019t want to participate in her hobby to this extent. And I also think it\u2019s fair that while this is a hobby she enjoys, it is also something that brings value to the house.\n\nYou said you\u2019re fine buying meals - ok. But the person you love and want to marry enjoys cooking now. And it will save you money and generally make you healthier. Overall what she\u2019s providing is a net positive. I would recommend *not* saying things like you\u2019d be just as happy buying food - true or not, it devalues what she\u2019s bringing to the table /rimshot. And not eating the food she made... I can see how logically you are avoiding benefitting from her labor, but honestly it just feels spiteful.\n\nThere\u2019s a happier balance for you two. You mentioned being happy with a lot of the past things you two tried, I would suggest that you try to get back to that. You and your gf sound like you can have a conversation about this and get there just fine. Just tell her you appreciate what she\u2019s doing, and you can understand that it is both a chore and a hobby. You\u2019re willing to pitch in some, but you\u2019re not as interested in cooking more difficult things and spending as much time doing it. Let her how much time you are willing to dedicate to cooking/cleaning each week and what you prefer doing (eg if you\u2019d rather clean up after or do some cooking with her, or maybe there\u2019s something you really hate doing, etc).",
            "I'm kind of boiling right now and pissed on behalf of you OP.  I'm surprised how she's not seeing that she  lucky to have you as a life partner. It seems she is manipulative and controlling to me. And yes, couples therapy is really needed. This is just a case of cooking and if not addressed well, it can turn into some different issue where she would be bossing around you throwing \"woman card\" and claiming you're not feminist enough because you're not jumping on her whims. \n\nI had an ex who would wants to be a \"chef\" once a month expecting me to be his slave doing all preparations,  and later on washing and scrubbing. Later on he would stutter like a dove bragging about how he is the best partner to have in life, and how he blessed me by cooking a meal. Come on , I can do all like I'm doing 29 days a month without making fuss about it ugh. It was good reddendnace when we broke up.  \n\nIf I were you,  I'd show this post to her and let her see the third perspective of redditors. After all this is what going to happen when you'd go to therapist. Do you think she would feel attacked that you brought up her cooking subject in therapy? I guess not.   Best of luck my friend. I hope she grow out of her cooking \"Hobby\" soon.",
            "I don't have anything to add - the OP was extremely well written and articulate and the advice was really high quality and well written too. \n\nI'm commenting to say that threads like this are why this is my favorite part of reddit, and it's really nice.",
            "Honestly OP you sound alittle bit like a whiny baby. Cooking at home is far healthier and less costly. Just because you *can* afford takeout doesn't mean that should be the only thing you eat. \n\nIf it wasn't for takeout and your Fianc\u00e9e would you be able to take care of yourself?",
            "You should divide it up so that you are each responsible for exactly half of the meals. If she wants to cook, that's on her. Ordering food is also a valid way of obtaining food.\n\nThat said, men tend to underestimate how many chores they're doing, so try to do what feels like 70% of the other chores if you want to get close to a real 50/50 split.",
            "So I'm not sure how much help I'm going to be. My spouse and I met in cooking school and have always loved it. However, the emotional labor tends to fall to me and i actually enjoy his company in the kitchen. So when I ask him to cut this or saute that it isn't because I COULDN'T do it but because I like hanging out in the kitchen together. Is that a possibility? That she just enjoys your company and feels giving you a job means you will stay with her? The elaborate meals are her ideas, yes, but should we not support our significant other's hobbies? My spouse went through a phase where he enjoyed fixing up old bikes. I provided him materials and company while he did his work. But I can't eat a bike lol. There needs to be some solid communication outside of highly emotional times (cooking can be incredibly emotional). Talk about how much you love she has found a hobby she enjoys, ask her if it is your company she wants or your labor. If my spouse sat at the table and just hung out with me while I cooked I would be pretty happy with that but he usually needs a task to keep him in one place. Find a compromise. Quarantine is wreaking havoc on emotional health and regulation and shit just kinda sucks some times.",
            "A little controversial. Only suggesting this since you're at an impasse after multiple conversations. \n\nIt's time to 'show' her what you mean. Find a 2 person activity that you're interested in e.g. videogames, walks, working out/ yoga etc. Divi up your free days between cooking and activity B. \n\nBest case scenario: she starts to understand what you mean when she has to spend hours doing sth she doesn't enjoy as much as cooking.\n\nWorst case scenario: she starts enjoying activity b. At least you still cut down your cooking by half. \n\nYou know what would be a nice touch? If some of the Activity B nights are date nights that you plan from scratch. Massages, movie nights that could lead to sexy time :)\n\nSpitballing here but hey who knows, might work!"
