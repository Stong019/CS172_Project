        "selftext": "Link to original post: https://redd.it/787q83\n\nI asked about going to a halloween party last week, that I was supposed to go to with my ex. I was getting social anxiety about the whole thing. I was scared of being surrounded by couples and being reminded of him.\n\nAnyways, I went. The friend who invited me actually went with me. Even though it was her boyfriend's party, she told me, if I wanted to leave anytime I could. We agreed to go and see how we feel and if I wasn't feeling it, we'd go back to her place for a chill night of scary movies and junk food. We went and I had a blast! No social anxiety whatsoever. I didn't even have to drink a lot to calm my nerves. I made new friends. Became closer to people I met in the past once or twice.\n\nBest part is, I didn't think about my ex even once at the party. I was too busy having a good time. Thanks to everyone who advised me to go and try to have fun. So glad I did :) \n\nEDIT: I wish I could respond to everyone, but sincerely, thank you so much :) I was having a tough few days but you guys have put a smile on my face. And yes, my friend is an amazing human and I am so grateful to have her.\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Was scared and having social anxiety about going to a party I was supposed to go to with my ex. Took everyone's advice and just went to feel it out and ended up having a wonderful time. I guess YOLO is right!",

She's the best. \n\nAnyway, I just want to share something I realized after I left an abusive ex years ago and they had introduced me to something I ended up liking. After we broke up I felt like I couldn't like that thing anymore because it would either remind me of my ex or feel tainted somehow. \n\nI decided that I can like or do anything I want. That by letting my ex determine what I can or cannot do or like that in a sense he was still controlling me, I decided to rise above that. That realization set me free of him. \n\nDon't let your ex stop you from living your life. Be free, be happy, move on. That chapter in your life has ended, no point in re-reading those same pages over and over. Focus on the current page and be excited for the next chapter. ",

You showed me compassion when I needed it the most and, at the end of it all, your advice was the wake-up call I needed and gave me more strength than you will know. Thank you a thousand times (from me and my mum!)**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLink to Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/43f57y/so_many_red_flags_you_could_see_them_from_space/\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo he came home last night and I pretended to be asleep. I didn\u2019t know what else to do, I felt paralysed. Then very early this morning he was looking at me suspiciously, telling me I seem very nervous which made me feel even more unnerved because I wondered if he knew what was going on. I was shaking and he asked \u201cWhy are you being like this? It\u2019s like you think I\u2019m going to hit you or something.\u201d That triggered something in me. I thought \u2018this is it, I\u2019m trapped\u2019 and I broke down crying, leading him to storm into the bedroom, slamming the door.   \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut then a little while later he opened the door and asked me to come in. His mood had done a complete 180 and he was almost too calm\u2026possibly even sad? Out of the blue he says we couldn\u2019t go on like this anymore, he says I\u2019m crying all the time, too negative, and \u2018discussing\u2019 too much (read: questioning his behaviour too much.) He said that he realised two days ago, in a meditation, that it isn\u2019t our destiny to be together. He said I\u2019m not the person he had created in his brain when he met me. His exact words were \u201cI created an angel and then you opened your mouth.\u201d He said he\u2019s losing more patience with me every second and even though I\u2019ve done a lot for him, it\u2019s not enough because he says he loves himself and is happy all the time so he needs someone who is the same, as well as a \u201creal woman\u201d (cooking and cleaning every day.) He said his brain is crazy around me and he can\u2019t deal with it anymore. His parting words were \u201cBelieve in yourself. Love yourself.\u201d I found myself getting more upset and more confused but instead of following my inclination to bargain with him (I know, I truly can\u2019t explain it) I tried to remember the things I had read on here and played along just in case this was some kind of test or manipulative behaviour. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI packed as quickly as I could, though it was in a daze so I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve left things behind. The whole time I was packing he stayed sitting on the bed just staring at the wall, the same position, not moving once\u2026 and then I left. No fight. No struggle. No words. Nothing. I felt paranoid waiting for something to happen, for him to react, I don\u2019t know, for some kind of trap, but no. I simply walked away. I was thinking all night about which exit strategy to use but he made it so easy? He, in essence, was the one to let me go? I\u2019m not complaining but Jesus, has it confused me all the more.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy mum knows everything (I sent the link to this post as suggested.) She\u2019s absolutely mortified but just wants to get me home. She has booked me on a flight back to England for this evening and stayed with me on the phone while I found a taxi to get me to the airport. I have a long time to wait but my mum said she\u2019d rather know that I\u2019m at an airport surrounded by people rather than being anywhere near him. So I thought I\u2019d use this opportunity to update you all because you\u2019ve all been so supportive, **I\u2019m really overwhelmed by all the messages and advice, I wasn't expecting it. Really, thank you for your kindness.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRight now I am just sitting in the airport, shell-shocked, wondering what the hell just happened. I read my original post again and know I haven\u2019t exaggerated a thing. Everything happened exactly as I said. Actually, more than those 26 things happened. If anything I omitted detail in an attempt to keep the post short.  But the way he acted this morning wasn\u2019t what I was expecting and from reading your replies, it\u2019s not what you were expecting either and so it has completely thrown me off guard. Honestly, I feel almost ashamed to tell you all what happened in case you also find it odd and question me, like I am questioning myself right now. I know it doesn\u2019t excuse everything he has done but does it give you a different perspective on things? Does this say more about me than it does him? Or is it manipulation to put the blame on me? I know he cannot bear the thought of anyone thinking badly of him, he wants to be idolised too much. Maybe it\u2019s from speaking to his friend. Or maybe I really am at fault and have been all along, because I keep thinking that if he is that controlling then why wouldn\u2019t he try to keep me there? Unless he realised he couldn\u2019t control me the way he expected.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease don\u2019t shoot me down for saying these things, I\u2019m just\u2026I don\u2019t know!? I don\u2019t understand the way this has panned out, and I\u2019m desperately trying to make sense out of it. I feel like a TV crew are going to walk out at any moment telling me this has all been some kind of sick joke. I\u2019m not purposefully trying to sound like a na\u00efve idiot, I\u2019m just finding it extremely hard to think logically or think at all for that matter. **I mean his last words to me were that he wants me to believe in myself and love myself for Christ sake.** I feel so confused and ashamed. My brain has whiplash from being on the rollercoaster of his multifaceted personality and feels even more scrambled right now. Nothing is really sinking in. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**tl;dr: I'm at the airport waiting to fly home.**",

            "YES. GOOD JOB. OMG. I'm over here screaming. I have legit never been so scared for an internet stranger in my life. I am so glad for this update. \n\nAlso excellent telling your mom. You absolutely need good people in your life to help you. Notice how your mom didn't shame you, all she said was \"come home!\" She gets it. Everybody on here got it too. We can't all be wrong, right? \n\nDon't be ashamed. Listen, you've been in a war. You're going to question yourself right now and worry it's your fault. That's textbook of abuse. When you get home, look into therapy with a licensed professional who specializes in domestic violence and personality disorders.\n\nSounds like your ex devalued you because you couldn't live up to his lofty expectations. It's a mindfuck. He said it to make you think there's something wrong with you, a parting jab to get at you. He's a lunatic asshole. He lied to you about so many things, why would you believe him on this?",
            "He has no idea your mom is flying you back. In his mind you're out wandering the streets lost without him. He's expecting you to come crawling back when you realize how perfect he is. \n\nHe WILL contact you again.  Just ignore him.",
            "He has you exactly where he wants you. Upset, questioning, doubting yourself, second guessing everything. He knew the game was up, and he got in a few last digs. He'd got everything he could get from you, without pushing you over the edge. Run like hell, never look back, block him on every form of contact, hug your mum, and try your best never to think of him again.",
            "He's a manipulator. He wants you to continue thinking that you were always the person doing something wrong and the relationship ended because you aren't good enough. It's going to take a long time to get over this relationship. That's normal. Take the time to take care of you! Do the things you want to do and explore hobbies/ things that make you happy. I'm glad you're away from him and your mother sounds wonderful. Good luck. ",
            "This is how he wants the story to go: \n\nHe just played the savvy, soulful boyfriend who can't control himself around you because he loves you too much. Now he's \"let you go\" as a show of his incredible spirit and love. He's left you with inspiring words so that you think of yourself as bad for leaving someone with such a good heart--even as he's letting you go, he STILL tells you to love yourself. How selfless!\n\nHe expects you to leave and feel terrible about it. How could you leave someone so selfless? And so, in a moment of realization, you'll spring up from the airport and run back to him. \"I don't want someone good for me,\" you'll say. \"I don't want someone healthy. I want you.\" \n\nHe wants you to choose his abuse. He wants you to think of him as a heartbreakingly selfless and good person who just can't help himself around you because he wanted you to be an angel and if only you just hadn't opened your mouth you might have filled his heart with pure love forever.\n\nWhen you instead choose to cut all contact and never speak to him again, he will get anxious and upset. He will freak out because the story isn't going his way. He will try to contact you again and will continue the story by telling you that he can't live without you, he's tried so hard to leave you alone because he KNOWS that would be beset for you, but he can't help himself. He'll try so much harder next time because he really is a good person, he just can't control himself, he promises he'll try so hard to control himself!\n\nDon't give in. Write your own story: a woman is lured in by an abusive man, but her spirit doesn't break. She gets herself out and lives her life. He tries to tempt her back in but she holds strong because she knows that he won't take care of her, SHE will take care of herself. And she becomes stronger in the end because of it, even if it scares her how much she used to love that scary, awful person. ",

Whatever the case, nothing excuses the treatment and manipulation you suffered at his hands.     \n\nYou've experienced emotional and sexual abuse.  He toyed with your mind and attempted to break you down.  You didn't let that happen.  You are going home now, to people who love and care for you.

He did this to you. You did nothing to deserve any of it. You will get through this. \n\nWhen you get home you need to see your GP immediately and ask for referral to a counsellor, let him/her know you were in an abusive situation and you need help. \n\nI am so pleased that you are out of there, I was so worried about you. Make sure all of your social networks are locked down, change all of your passwords and email passwords, make sure you've blocked him on your phone.\n\nGo home, cry and have many hugs and take care of yourself.

            "Hey OP.  I'm so glad that you're out of there, and I have a word of warning for you.  The danger about experiencing a manipulative and toxic relationship like this doesn't end when the relationship does.  You will always need to be mindful of the scars it will leave.  I speak from experience from growing up in a manipulative home.  You have a wound that needs to heal, and unfortunately manipulative people will be able to spot it and try to open it again...whether that's your horrible ex or someone else.  Protect yourself and build up your strength.  \n\nI want to share something that happened to me that I've tried to always carry in my mind.  One of the most easily-exploited traits that I have is that I am a people-pleaser (no matter how much I hate that side of myself, it'll always be there a little).  I'm a graduate student and once caught a student who had cheated on an assignment after I helped her and gave her an extension.  The student met with my advisor and me and tried to insinuate that it was my fault for not helping her enough.  After the meeting, my advisor checked in with me to tell me I had done just fine.  I told her I was trying not to second-guess myself, but that it kind of hurt when the student blamed me even though I had been trying to help her.  My advisor looked at me and said, \"Yeah, well... she *meant for it to hurt you*.\"\n\nI don't know why but that was such a crystal clear moment for me.  Like...somehow I can scrutinize my own actions down to the molecular level and imagine all this responsibility, but that when someone else hurts me deeply *they somehow didn't realize it??*\n\n**Your ex knew exactly what he was doing** and how to get into your head.  Leave him to spin his wheels alone.  Remember the JADE trick to dealing with manipulators - don't justify, argue, defend, or explain.  If he contacts you, he'll make you feel like you owe him one of those things.  You are under no obligation to explain yourself or say one more thing to him, but he will make you think you *want* to explain yourself.  That's a tactic too.\n\n**Edit:**  I want you to promise yourself something.  If he contacts you somehow (directly, through a friend, etc), and you feel the need to argue/respond/justify yourself, *come here to do it instead.*  Make another update.  Don't respond to him, but say whatever you feel like you need to say to him *to us instead.*  You can get it off your chest and be heard without feeding this emotional vampire of a person, and we'll back you up.",

            "My ex narcissist said he was \"Happy all the time\" too. Truth told he was the most miserable person I've ever met. \n\nAngry all the time, insecure, criticizing, insulting, and nitpicking me and EVERYONE else, always feeling slighted, short changed, and overlooked, never satisfied or happy with anything anyone did at any time ever.\n\nHe was the literal opposite of \"Happy all the time\"\n\nA narcissists ideal relationship is with a doormat. Someone who never questions and always takes the fall. They cannot function in any way in a relationship with a normal person, in which BOTH people sometimes make mistakes, there are sometimes outside stresses, and the other person has wants, needs, limits, and boundaries of their own *like a healthy person should*.\n\nThey just want a yes woman. \n\nAnd they are NOT \"Happy all the time\".

The fact you're leaving and going to your mom will have him backtracking within hours, once you don't come crawling back to him.

            ">Out of the blue he says we couldn\u2019t go on like this anymore, he says I\u2019m crying all the time, too negative, and \u2018discussing\u2019 too much (read: questioning his behaviour too much.) He said that he realised two days ago, in a meditation, that it isn\u2019t our destiny to be together. He said I\u2019m not the person he had created in his brain when he met me. His exact words were \u201cI created an angel and then you opened your mouth.\u201d He said he\u2019s losing more patience with me every second and even though I\u2019ve done a lot for him, it\u2019s not enough because he says he loves himself and is happy all the time so he needs someone who is the same, as well as a \u201creal woman\u201d (cooking and cleaning every day.) \n\nLook how up to the last minute this abuser blamed everything on you. He deserves this perfect woman because he is a perfect man, and you just couldn't live up to what he needed! :/\n\nUgh. He sounds like a cult leader. What an awful human. OP, the right man won't make you feel sad, confused, dependent, lost, scared, and ashamed. He will make you feel strong, powerful, brave, assured, confident, beautiful, and like you have something to offer him.\n\nBecause you are, and you do.\n\nWait for that man.\n\nGo home and recover from the abuse.",
            "What he did was simply one more manipulation in a long line of manipulations. Make sure you get on that plane. He played into your doubts and fears to reinforce his massive ego and entitlement. He is trying to convince himself that he is not at fault and you are the source of all of his problems. He will succeed, because narcissists do not change. \n\nMake sure you get on that plane. You need the support of people who care about you and your well-being. Therapy would help if you can afford it. You are in the position of an abused child, confused, afraid that you deserved all of the abuse because there is something inherently wrong with you. It will take time but you can heal.\n\nWhatever you do, never read, talk, text, email or see this man again. You are exceptionally vulnerable right now and will be for some time. He may try to lie his way back into your life and, for the sake of your future happiness and safety, that cannot happen.",
            "OP, you are amazing!!! You saw an opportunity and took it. Please don't minimize what you have accomplished. Abuse victims typically miss multiple opportunities to leave their abusers, and for those who finally get away, they look back as are are now with great regret that they didn't leave sooner. \n\nPlease don't blame yourself for anything that happened. Stay focused on getting on that plane, getting your body away from this hell, and in the months ahead, cleaning your mind of the lies and twisted thinking that he implanted in you. \n\nPlease understand that human beings are hackable. Abusers know how to manipulate every natural and good human instinct to love, bond and care for others into their exclusive and depraved service. \n\nIn other words, you would have to be a very unusual person indeed not to have been under this man's spell. \n\nWhen you get home, find the best therapist you can who specializes in helping abuse victims recover. Don't delay--the faster you heal, the easier it is. \n\nThis is fantastic news and I know that everybody who reads this is doing a happy dance! You were in a horrifying situation, and you saved yourself with your intelligent instincts. Also, your mom deserves a party for stepping up and being awesome! \n\nDearest OP, everything is going up from here. It won't always be easy, but you have a wonderful life ahead of you, even if you can't see it yet. \n\nEdit: I didn't mention anything he said, but every single phrase out of that man's mouth could have constituted its own post. This man is truly a demonic being. Bring these posts to your therapist so that he or she can see what you were up against. ",
            "He's manipulative to the end, OP. Working you, controlling you, keeping you off balance, not love, was always the point. He thought his abuse would keep you docile and eager to please him but your sense of self and right and wrong was strong enough that his abuse had you anxious and in tears, as is appropriate. \n\nWhen you've settled in at home, you might google signs of abuse and the cycle of abuse. You'll see so many familiar things and you'll be able to recognize them in the future.\n\nPut one foot in front of the other, don't look back. You're doing everything right, keep moving.",

He's expecting you to come crawling back to him, feeling guilty like he trained you to. Go home, don't look back, block him everywhere and get in contact with a therapist, it will take months to get over what happened to you, better start as soon as possible. Don't let this destroy you, don't let him win. Get help, stay safe. ",

He absolutely trapped you into a Web of sorrow, making you doubt everything. His parting shot was yet another stab at your self belief. Take the time to recover from this nightmare. Block him from every social media, change your phone number, possibly change your phone, get every electronic device he had access to scanned in case he has installed keyloggers and do not open any attachments unless you are on a public access computer  for example the library's.

I read your update and out of curiosity I went to check your original post....I got to number seven before I couldn't read anymore. You did not deserve anything that happened to you with him, you have done no wrong, you are not dirty or wrong or abnormal. You are a wonderful human who happened to get caught in a trap which was disguised as love and promise. \nDo not analyze the situation right now, just focus on getting back home.

Telling you to 'love yourself' was not him telling you that he genuinely cared, it was 1) an attempt to save face, coupled with 2) an attempt to make you feel like such an idiotic piece of crap that you would change your mind and stay. Telling you to love yourself in that way implies that you are a weak, feeble person who just can't seem to pull yourself together. He knew his words would hurt you and that was his goal.\n\nYou did the right thing. Please please please, don't doubt that. It is wise of you to take the time to try to figure out what the hell was wrong with him, but don't doubt that this man was a manipulative abuser. \n\nI am so grateful that you are on your way home!

            "I'm so happy to hear that you're going home. Please take care of yourself. Have you considered personal counseling? They can help you recover from trauma like this. They can also help you recognize the warning signs of an abuser before things progress. From your original post:\n\n>He was full of grand proclamations of undying love, saying I am his everything and that I\u2019m his reason for living, he said I\u2019m his soulmate, that he wants to marry me, have children, the works.\n\nThat was actually your first red flag. \"Love bombing\" and coming on too strong too fast in a dizzying tornado of over the top affection is very common among abusers. They sweep you up in this whirlwind romance to get you hooked. \n\nTake care of yourself. You will need time to heal. Seek out people who truly care about you. ",
            "It is manipulation through and through. I'm not surprised you're even thinking this could be generosity, or a glimmer of good will ... You are still in the middle of this, and you've been on a fucking rollercoaster. \n\nYou will see it too, soon. You will see it for the disgusting manipulation it is. It is actually supposed to put blame on you. But right now? Don't try to untangle this horrible mess. Don't think about what it all meant or what sense to make out of it. Try to relax, and get back, and keep safe. But put off all that. You need to focus on healing right now. There will be time to wreck your brain if you will still feel like you need to do it. \n\nAnd if you ever feel like he spoke those words about loving yourself honestly, please don't forget that he used those same words when humiliating and pressuring you like you used to do to yourself in front of the mirror. Those words mean nothing from his mouth. Nothing. Do not listen to anything from his mouth ever again. Set up filters for his number, so that you can save evidence in case it's necessary but don't have to read it. It's very likely he'll try to throw some hooks into you if he ever feels like maybe he'd like to try and subdue you again.",

He messed up my head so bad I was chronically dating emotionally manipulative people. I always felt like they were doing me a favour by spending time with me.\n\nGet help back home and rebuild your self confidence. Don't give your energy to people like him.",
            "He knew you were thinking of breaking up with him, so he wanted to dump you before you could dump him.

As others have said, he will probably try to contact you when he realizes you won't come crawling back to him. \n\nDon't do it. Don't believe anything he says to try to get you back.

            "He idealized you to an extreme, which you interpreted as \"love\" until the two of you actual started getting to know each other.  This degree of idealization is not normal.\n\nWhat you just went through is a departure from regular reality - he created a bubble of his crazy thoughts and behaviors, and I'm sure that's what he always does.

            "This guy is a pro. I have worked with women who have been abused and the abusers follow basic steps. \n\nStep 1. Be the sweetest, most caring man you have ever met. He declares his love for you and tells you he can't be without you. \n\nStep 2. Isolation! Gets you away from friends and family. \n\nStep 3. Is control. This starts with little things such as how to do your hair or what to wear and then leads to full on abuse. \n\nTake whatever opportunity you have to get out. He could be manipulating you or be serious but either way you are lucky to have an exit. This happens to a lot of women (poor, rich, educated, uneducated...) and many of them don't have a safe exit like this so take it. ",
            "First I just want to say how relieved, happy, and proud I am! I woke up thinking about this and have been checking for the update. Secondly, despite how he may have seemed today his handling of the situation is still very unstable. It was manipulative and a way to protect his own ego. Some things that stood out to me...\n\nYou didn't mention him being empathetic towards you at all. You said he acted differently and acknowledged some of the problems you had been having but it wasn't because they upset you it was because he was annoyed with you expressing your feelings and you not wanting to roll over and do everything his way.\n\n\"I created an angel and then you opened your mouth\". Uhhhhh wtf? Soooo many things messed up about that but one I'll point out is that he doesn't take responsibility for building a false version of you. He instead words it to blame you. It also sounds so misogynistic as if you should have been seen and not heard (idk maybe just me).\n\nHe's always happy? He made it sound like he was miserable around you because you were questioning things and you were constantly not complying with his \"needs\" and wants. You said yourself you guys had spent little time apart so idk how he was always happy when he was throwing temper tantrums a lot. \n\nHe said his last words as one last mind fuck. \n\nTo be honest those type of people usually prey on more weak and easily manipulated people. He may have thought he could do that to you and groom you to be his \"angel\". He got impatient with you because you were messing up his plan by being a strong person. He didn't try to stop you because it will be easier for him to find someone else that is weak and easily broken than for him to try to \"break\" you. Please don't look back or question leaving. Not only would you have been incredibly unhappy but I can guarantee the abuse would have gotten worse and if you had gotten pregnant you would have brought s child into a dangerous situation and made it harder for you to get out of. ",
            "Yay! So glad you're on your way home, i was waiting for this update. The thoughts you are having are completely normal for someone who has been through what you have. The way he did this was to ensure that you would feel this way; doubting yourself and blaming yourself. Whatever you do, do not go back to him. Do not contact him and ignore him if he contacts you. In fact block him before this happens. Go home to your mum and forget about this nightmare. Be proud of yourself for getting out, no matter how it happened. It feels awful now but I promise you will forget about him, and the pain and confusion will all go with time. Sending you good thoughts from a fellow Brit! ",

The top comment makes more sense of it, probably his last digs or even ground work in case he wants to lower your self esteem to pull you back at some point. Keep the no contact in place and get some counselling, this relationship was completely toxic and you need to start working through it.

            "Hey, I'm proud of you. Like everyone else said get home, hug your mom, block all contact with him - then take a nap.

If you ask for a little space (assuming you need it) I'm sure she will oblige you.\n\nI didn't go through quite the same ordeal you did but I did spend ~3 years trapped in an apartment with an abusive person and I thought he'd kill me before he'd let me leave. I had some wonderful friends help me out of my situation. \n\nEverything you're feeling right now... like you did something wrong/ could've been better/ wondering if he's right? It's okay to feel that way. All of those thoughts work themselves out but it takes time. As for you not loving yourself... you do. Or you never would've left. He doesn't get to make you doubt that about yourself.\n\nI would say that the hard part is over, but it's just one hard part. The hardest part for me was the months of anger at myself for \"allowing\" myself to be in that situation in the first place. This went back and forth with anger toward him for being a shitty person and not treating me the way I deserve to be treated. Some days are still hard, I still have nightmares sometimes. But other days I forget he ever happened or the memories are just a passing whisper. I'm so sorry... it really does take time. In the meantime focus on setting goals and getting your life back in order. It would not have served me to have stayed in bed, shellshocked from the experience. He wasted enough of my time, I wasn't going to waste more of it. Especially not on him. He didn't deserve the time he got out of you, give him now as little of your thoughts as possible while still making an effort to work out your feelings.\n\nYou're going to be okay.",

No, now he can tell everyone \"I told her to believe in herself and love herself, we just weren't meant to be.\" He gets to absolve himself of any blame and you get to question everything about yourself. You were abused, and reading your story brought back memories of my abusive relationship. I can tell you that distance and time makes you aware of how messed up everything was, even though you feel crazy right now. I questioned everything when I left him, too. He told all his friends and family that he did and gave up everything for me, while I was an unappreciative, cheating bitch. None of it was true, but that's how he took the blame off himself and made it seem like he was the victim. You are lucky that his pride was more important to him than you were, or else it could have gone very differently. You're safe now, I would suggest seeing a counsellor to fully understand how abusers operate and to realize that this isn't your fault. You're not crazy for knowing how crazy he is.",

I worry that those things are still there, and though you've learned a valuable lesson from this experience, there are abusers and crazy people far more subtle than your ex that may lead you into the same trap.

Just wild and yelling and craziness over petty things.\n\nThen when I'd break down and was at my most vulnerable, he'd totally flip a 180 and suddenly be the calm and rational adult one and talk to me as though I were a child and he was granting me his almighty wisdom. Things about how I didn't know or love myself, telling me how I should be acting and provided outlandish psychological analysis about why I acted a certain way, yada yada yada. Absolutely bizarre.

(My ex would often break up with me and then 'take me back' to remind me that he was in control and I had to do what he said.) It's important that you don't go back if he comes and says he made a mistake, as then it's a manipulation tactic. It's likely that this is what will happen, as he didn't know you would leave the country. Take this oppurtunity to get out safely and rebuild yourself. Be strong. Sometimes, the aftermath can be the worst part of an emotionally abusive relationship. You might feel like a shell of a person and want to go back. Don't listen to the voice telling you to do that.

Go home and get centered again...get back to who you are. Maybe get some therapy about this, if nothing else, to find out how to avoid manipulative, abusive relationships in the future. But even if you decide not to, I think you are VERY, very lucky here to have such an opportunity to learn from this without too much expense (the lessons get more expensive as we grow...and at least this time, you didn't have a kid in the mix, no pets even...he could have drained your bank account...could be far more expensive).

All that shit he said when he \"let\" you go was a really deep, really sick attempt a messing with your mind even more, making you feel worthless and rejected. He is a predator. And you are smart, you realized what he was, and you got out!!! And don't be afraid to ask for help when you get out. Psychologically, this seems like a tough situation to overcome.

            "I'm not quite so sure this guy has let you go so much as he's expecting you to come back. However, having been in an abusive relationship before, I can confirm that the nicest thing that particular ex did for me was \"let me go.\" He didn't really let go - he stalked me and attempted to harass me for months afterwards, and he threatened me up and down after he broke up with me. That's the kind of thing abusive people do. I would be very surprised if this is the last you hear from this guy - which is why it is SO important that you get home to people who love and care about you and NEVER contact this guy again.\n\nThis guy's behavior is textbook abusive behavior. He targeted you, preyed on you, and he's been gaslighting you since the beginning. He said those things when you left as a way of furthering the charade he's putting on - he said them to make you doubt your own sanity even further, to make you feel like you're the crazy one, and he's just some great guy that you screwed over. He wants you to come back of your own accord, completely unsure of yourself, and beg him to take you back. He wants a slave, someone he can control, not a girlfriend.\n\nI am so, so happy you told your mother about this. PLEASE get home safely. After you are home, it would be a good idea to find a therapist to help you work this and to keep you from any temptation you may have to go back to this monster. Block him on everything you can, and consider speaking to the police about this guy, just so he's on their radar if he tries to come after you in your home country. IF he ever goes as far as showing up at your door, DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR. Call the police. Don't let him in, and don't let him anywhere near you or your family members. \nTime will help here.

            "I once dated a guy very similar to this. Well. not as scary, but equally as narcissistic and trying to play it off as concerned for how I \"loved myself\". If I can predict anything from that experience, it's that he's delusionally (it's a word now, ok?) trying to test your commitment to him. He expects you to fight back. To do just what your first reaction was and to bargain for him. To give up yourself and what you love to keep him. So he can mold you into who he wants you to be. \n\nHe was probably staring at the wall because you didn't immediately jump to his desires, but he's now consoling himself with the possibility (in his mind only possibility) that you will come back to him after being alone and scared in a foreign country. Or worst case scenario, after awhile you'll come to your senses and know that he was the best thing that could ever happen to anyone and you were so lucky to be chosen by him. Either way, you'll come crawling back eventually. Having learned your lesson.\n\nWhen this doesn't happen, OP, there will be hell to pay. He will go bat shit insane on you. He will leave you 10 minute voice messages, he will call your parents, he will threaten/come to where you are, no matter if it's in a foreign country or not (yup, that happened). When that doesn't work, he will send you ridiculously long emails from 40 different accounts oscillating between telling you how much he loves you, and then how you are the most horrible person alive (using all your fears that you told him in confidence).\n\nSo. Block him. from everything. Get a new email address, a new number, make sure your mom's house is secure. Become your own witness protection program. Maybe invest in a security system. Luckily, nothing really dangerous happened to me, just hints of it. I think his mom held him under control from doing anything truly damaging, but from what you've said, that doesn't seem to be something you can assume will be your case. \n\n Just go about this assuming he is going to try to hurt you. And prepare for whatever scenario you can imagine. If they don't end up happening, AWESOME. Better to be prepared though.\n\nStay safe!",
            "What an awful, sick, twisted, backwords man. Sometimes the people who seem the most perfect are the ones who are the least perfect when you get to know them. I know you said he was a real prince charming when you first met him. More like the devil now....its very easy to charm someone before youve met them in person :/\n\nAnd thats what he did. He charmed you, then he gaslit you. From Wikipedia:\n\n>Gaslighting or gas-lighting is a form of mental abuse in which information is twisted or spun, selectively omitted to favor the abuser, or false information is presented with the intent of making victims doubt their own memory, perception, and sanity.[1][2] Instances may range simply from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred, up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim.\n\nBasically they start making you doubt yourself in small ways..then more and more and more until the situation has gotten ridiculous but because you have grown used to their antics it becomes very hard to tell exactly HOW abusive they are being. He did this. He knew he was doing this. Its not your fault that it escalated so much. He was the one with selfish intentions.\n\nAll to make you into some *imaginary princess*. He idealized you in his mind because he is deranged and he wanted to do ANYTHING to force you to fit that idea he had.\n\nHe is living in a fantasy world, OP. He will someday find that out. Most importantly I hope YOU understand that he lives in a fantasy, idealized world that he is desperate for. That reflects badly on him, not you. You ARE normal. Your not wrong for not being a literal barbie housewife princess! Deep down I truly hope you know that. Its ok to be you. \n\nIts going to be very important to spend all your time with people who know its ok for you to be you, from here on out, but especially during the healing process. I think hanging out with people who genuinely care about you and DONT make you feel confused will open your eyes a lot to whats really going on. I grew up in an abusive home...I definitely saw first hand that you cant get out of that fog of confusion until your OUT of the situation 100% and around GOOD people.\n\nI really wish you the best. Im really glad you got out. Please please never talk to that guy again. Theres a good chance he will try to message/call you again. Dont give him that chance. Dont even ignore him. You dont need any conflicting thoughts right now. Just block him. Whatever place you met him on, delete that account. Its not worth keeping.\n\n\n\n",

You weren't \"happy with where life was going\" so you just up and leave?  He is probably mentally ill, considering his need for control and flip flopping emotions about you and your relationship, but how are literally ANY of your actions the ones of a person who's not also mentally ill?  And judging from your description, it would be informative to know what country he lives in.  The truth is, there are many countries where a man having the controlling upper hand in the relationship and expecting his wife/girlfriend to cook and clean is very normal.  This is not a judgement of whether that is right or wrong, it is only an observation of many (I want to say most) countries, out of all the countries that exist.  At what point is something culturally expected of him and indoctrinated versus him being a monster who only lives to tear your world apart?\n\nI'm not trying to make you feel bad, but everyone on here is saying \"thank god you SURVIVED this,\" like you were held captive.  The truth is, you weren't abducted, you weren't born into a caste system or pressured financially, sexually, or physically to move in with him.  It wasn't a guy at work badgering you constantly and wearing you down, it wasn't a tinder fling, it was you saying \"i hate my life, maybe this guy who says i'm the one after knowing me for 2 seconds will fix my life, i'll MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY.\"  Your fear about not knowing the language when he tried to kick you out?  Classic first world shit, expecting travel to always work out because how people not speak english??? Come on, you were going to travel all over as some adventuring backpacker and hadn't even sort of brushed up on a few words, and couldn't think of any plans to get out of this, when a fucking cell phone and your bank account is sitting right there?  You were not destined to be an adventuring backpacker then.  Please stop saying \"oh i was thrown into this crazy storm of being an outsider who doesn't know anything, it's so fucked\"  Why you?  Because....you fucking moved there, you literally bought and paid for a ticket to be there.  And didn't leave til you got kicked out.  This is about to sound hella mean, but based on your info, the facts are that you dated a dick, you didn't enjoy sex but also didn't actually get up and end intercourse (based on a fear of physical abuse that never happened??), then got dumped, and everyone's like \"omg you're such a warrior you've been through so much you brave woman.\"   He just sounds like a straight up idiot, but he's not fucking satan.  Life in general is like him, it will walk all over you if you just sit there wondering how you feel about it.\n\n  You can do what everyone tells you to, which is pat yourself on the back every day for blocking him on social media and talking to a therapist about how awful he was, but you should also take into consideration that your actions were that of a person who makes really fucking big decisions spontaneously based on little knowledge, and then is surprised when it goes to shit.  You sound like you were trying to outrun depression and wanted a lot of validation, and you might find yourself in a similar predicament if you don't stop and talk to a therapist about your severe lack of self confidence and the dangerous places you've chosen to go to to fill that void.",

            "Throwaway here, I just had to respond. I'm happy for you and I think I could answer your questions differently than most people that have so far. \n\n\nYour ex reminds me of an extreme version of myself. I am jealous, controlling, and manipulative. I am a broken person. Many things that he did were extreme and he took it too far. The advice you received was great and I'm happy that you're safe. \n\nMost people thought that he was a complete psychopath, and that might very well be true, but to me he just wanted what he wanted and that mattered to him a lot. He lives a lie, he wants everyone to like him and he wants to love himself but the truth is he's not happy with himself and has a very poor self esteem. How would he react if someone said someone bad mouthed him? It sounds like he wants you to be perfect, because he doesn't feel he can be, but he believes you have the potential to be the perfection that he'll never have. If you only work on yourself a little bit more. His intentions are not malicious, though his actions definitely are and he crosses the line. It sounds like he's been thinking about this, and he blames you for everything that goes wrong because you'll never be the perfection that he wants. He doesn't hate you or want to mistreat you, he's a broken person. I think he'll never figure out what he did wrong. I think he's a bit shocked at how you're reacting at what he believes to be perfectly reasonable requests. I think he's feeling bad that things didn't work out and thought the right thing to do would be just to let you go. \n\n\nAgain, these are all assumptions based on my own reflection and thoughts, to me they are accurate. I struggle with my own personality almost every day.",

Well I did, but the officer that talked with me said I shouldn't file a police report yet and should contact Candie and try to procure the money from her to show that when I do file a police report I can show them that I made every attempt to get it from her and that she is aware of the theft. So, I messaged her:\n\n\"Candie, in the month of March our Girl Scouts' bank account was drained. I went to the bank and have account statements and withdrawal slips showing that you made unauthorized withdrawals from the account. If you do not restore the account I will be filing a police report on June 1st to protect myself and the girls\"\n\nHer response:\n\n\"I will be restoring it no worries. It was not all me but I will be replacing it because I am the one who lost the information. But thank you. I am putting in a certain amount each month towards both girl scouts and the bank. But thank you, I got what you are saying.\"\n\nMy response:\n\n\"I spoke with the branch manager at the bank. They have evidence that it was you. I have had a bank account there for over a decade, they require you to show proper ID when you withdraw money from the account. Also, there are cameras outside and inside the building.\"\n\nCandie's response:\n\n\"Well without going into my personal information, I do not remember it, but I am being treated for it. Acknowledged my mistake and will take care of it. It will all be paid to the GS council before August 1st and the remainder of the money is accounted for between my trip to the council shop and the stuff I will be purchasing for the water park. My first payment to them is June first  because that is my first check for my new job. That is all I'm saying on any of this.\"\n\nAfter that, I talked with the GS council again and sent them the messages. I told them that if they didn't resolve this I would. They had a meeting about it the next day and decided to remove Candie as a volunteer (obviously) and that they would be going after her for the full amount of what they owe the Girl Scouts and what she stole from our troop. They also agreed to deposit the money right back into our account as soon as she was removed from the bank account. I was super happy about this resolution! There is a catch though... they didn't want me to tell the parents at our last meeting that this was going on. They had to officially send Candie a letter of removal before it was official. Also my contact at the GS council said they still wanted me to pass out flyers for Candie's water park event that she promised. I was pissed about that, because this lady might have a drug problem or something, how in hell can you trust that she will go buy anything for the water park or even show up? AND if she does what if she uses it as an opportunity to scam them out of more money? They had Candie drop off the troop meeting information on my porch so I didn't have to talk to her.\n\nWell, I went to the meeting and no one ended turning up because Candie had conveniently scheduled it the day before they had the day off of school, which I wasn't aware of since I don't have a child in the school. So no one thought there was a meeting. I was actually really happy about that, because I didn't want to encourage them to go to this supposed water park event hosted by criminal Candie. \n\nAfter that, the Girl Scout Council agreed to send a representative to have a meeting with the parents and go over our options for next year and having a new troop leader. Candie sent me a message this morning (I guess one of the parents clued her in about our meeting):\n\n\"The only thing that needs to be discussed at tonight's meeting, is the fact that I will not be returning as troop leader for Troop \nxxxxxx, my family is moving and will no longer be in the school district or nearby to be able to continue with the truth. I wish you the best of luck.\"\n\n\nYes, screw her for trying to cover her own ass. Even though I would love to tell everyone how terrible she is, I decided not to tell the parents about Candie. I thought about it a lot, and if I did, one of the parents will tell their daughter and then everyone will be gossiping about Candie's daughter. It is not this poor girl's fault that her step mom is a crook and I don't want her to get bullied because of it. I also think it would turn a lot of the parents away from the troop and I don't want to ruin everyone's girl scout experience because of me. Candie is gone and can't be a part of the troop anymore, so good riddance. Girl Scouts are going after her for all of the money so she will have to face the legal consequences as well. Me telling the parents wouldn't help anything.\n\nAlso, on a positive note, at the meeting one of the parents said they will step up and be troop leader, yay! I have decided to stay on and help them as much as possible. I want to have a good experience volunteering and I shouldn't give up because of one jerk. \n\n\n**edit** Just wanted to add to those that are worried that Candie can do this to another troop, she has been black listed from the Girl Scouts organization nationally, she is not allowed to be in any leadership role. As far as her doing something shady somewhere else otherwise... there's not a whole lot I can do about that. I can't let everyone in my state know she is a scumbag, so it is what it is. \n   \ntl;dr: Candie was kicked out of the troop and the Girl Scouts are legally pursuing her for the money stolen from both the Girl Scouts and the troop. We're moving on! ",

She's her own defense attorney's worst nightmare.\n\nSo, the GS are going after Candie now? Will the cops be involved? I don't know what's more frustrating, the GS covering this up or Candie's total lack of remorse.",
            "This is a great update! You've acted like a fantastic role model and, even though the kids and parents won't know about this incident, I'm sure that they'll get so much out of what you can teach them. I was in Girl Scouts as a kid and it really made a difference when we had a leader who really cared about the troop. Thank you for sticking it out for another year.\n\nCongrats on the new leader situation and best wishes towards another year of campfires and cookies! Eat a sleeve of Trefoils for me!",
            "So, did I interpret that correctly?  Is Candie suggesting she has some sort of condition that caused her to forget each time she went to the back and stole money from children?  Really?\n\nBut it is good that you didn't tell the parents or that it isn't on the news.  When I was in high school, the treasurer for the band boosters stole nearly $40,000 from the savings account.  His daughter was definitely treated differently by other students: her dad was made fun of, people made assumptions about drugs or other things he may have been into to lead him to steal the money, things that she had, people would ask if the band boosters bought it for her, etc, just getting harassed by other students for something she didn't do and didn't know about.  And I'm not sure if younger kids or teenagers would treat someone worse if their parent was caught stealing from an organization they volunteer for, to be honest.  So even though it would be super tempting to show people Candie's true colors, I'm sure you spared her stepdaughter a lot of anguish.  ",
            "Good, you've got a new leader, happy to hear.\n\nDon't worry about Candie anymore, the Girl Scouts are dealing with it, you don't have to. \n\nlol, that last message, \"I won't be able to deal with the truth.\", I think she may be comprehending what's happening. ",
            "Sadly this happens a little too often. I've seen parents never show up with hundreds of dollars in cookie money and have to be reported to council. Cookie moms with missing money. Parents running unsanctioned booths getting robbed. Parents running unsanctioned booths getting \"robbed\". And lastly scout leaders with fuzzy accounting practices \"one for you, one, two, three for me...\" At the end of the day they're all just people just as inclined to do bad things as any other part of the population.  ",
            "This happened in my troop when I was a kid! The troop leader stole our cookie money and went to Atlantic City. The council refused to do anything about it, and our parents made up the difference. I think Girl Scouts of America discouraged publicity for their own benefit, not ours.\n\nCandie won't have a record now, and will be able to repeat her crime in another town. You should publicize what happened so that it comes up in a Google search of her name.",

You definitely did the right thing. \n\nOne thing that might be good to put in place going forward is requiring two signatures to withdraw funds from the troop account or for writing a cheque. In this case, your signature and the new troop leader. \n\nI was treasurer for a voluntary community based group for over two years. We never had any issues like this, especially because of the the 2 signatures rule. But I saw several other voluntary groups have these issues.\n\nIts a shame because it could definitely turn people off volunteering. I'm glad you have decided to stick it out :)",
            "All this really did was reinforce in Candie's mind that she is above the law and can do what ever she wants (like felony theft), blame it on mental illness and get away with it. Her only consequence is that she was \"fired\" as a volunteer but still got to keep her reputation as an upstanding citizen. Oooh yeah they will send her collections, big deal! I'd be willing to bed her credit is crap anyway. \nI know OP had didn't have the final say in all that but it just seemed like the GSOA were more interested in keeping it quiet than righting a wrong. Which I think would be a good lesson for the kids that they would probably never forget...you steal, you go to jail. \nGood for you OP for not letting this make you stop volunteering.",
            "Good on you for taking the high road to spare both additional drama within the troop and for her daughter, that takes a lot of strength and humility to do. You said it perfectly, she's gone and has to face what she did on her own, and you all can move on without any more interference from her. A happy update. Good luck!",
            "Excellent foresight on not telling the parents. A lesser person (probably me, haha) would have just gone scorched earth without thinking of the repercussions, but that was a very smart move that will definitely pay dividends, or at least minimize losses. Glad it all worked out!",

I'd actually inadvertently do boyfriend things like put my hand on the small of her back as I would pass by just completely out of habit.

I actually wish that my ex would have shut me out 100% from the first day because it would have made things so much easier in the long run. I can see that now, but it's very difficult to have that foresight without having gone through it. Be direct. Tell him yes it's forever.

It\u2019s hard to learn that while love can be unconditional attachment and romance are not. \n\nShow him some grace through mercy by going no contact. Let him know exactly why you are doing it. That way there is no mistaking that the relationship is over but your love for him continues. That little bit of reassurance as you both go your separate ways is in a way a beautiful thing. It\u2019s just hard for some people to see in the moment.",

However, she is probably the most passive-aggression person I've ever known and has a history of throwing me under the bus if it means helping someone else. She isn't a bad person, she's just not considerate of me sometimes. For example, my laptop which I use for work (graphic design) broke and I couldn't afford another one, and she knew that, and she knew I was struggling to save up for another; my uncle died and she took his new $1800 Macbook and gave it away to someone who just needed something basic for Facebook and job applications. Mom knows about laptops so it wasn't like she thought it was cheap.**\n\n\nI had a mastectomy about two weeks ago (didn't actually have cancer, so chemo etc. isn't a factor in this). I'm still recovering and need to be taking it easy. Right now I'm trying to keep swelling at bay as I don't want yet another surgery and potential disfigurement, so I need to stay sedentary. I do go out for a couple of hours here and there, but I'm careful.\n\nMy grandma (66), who is my dad's mom and lives an hour away, had hand surgery today (repairing a trigger finger). My mother called me after and told me that my grandma needs help and needs someone to take care of her and basically do everything for her. My grandma is very independent, no signs of dementia or anything, and is an active person, so this was surprising to me and kind of came out of the blue. If I'd known recovery would be a big deal, I would've put surgery off until after she had recovered, but she decided to have it with almost no advance warning, and when I researched it to see if I did need to reschedule my surgery, it seemed like hers was pretty minor.\n\nThe problem is, Mom told me that she told my grandma I could take care of her (Mom and Dad work full-time, and I'm not working right now so I guess that was her logic, but I'm not working BECAUSE I JUST HAD SURGERY). I asked her why she would put me in that position and she said she had no idea what I was talking about. I said she knows I'm recovering from my own surgery and she said I \"seemed fine\"... I said I was, as long as I stayed home and kept ice on my chest and took it easy, and that she should've checked with me first. I pulled a childish move when she started berating me and hung up on her.\n\nShe texted me almost immediately and said, word for word: \"I guess Gram knows you better than I do! Maybe she thought you would \"feel pressured\" so didn't include you [in the group text] when asking for help. I didn't expect that at all!\"\n\nNeedless to say I'm crushed. I would LOVE to take care of her, but I can't. Now I feel like everyone thinks I'm a selfish monster and am depressed to the point of feeling sick. I wrote back and told her not to talk to me right now, and I know she's going to call me when she gets out of work but I don't know what to say. :(\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: I had a mastectomy two weeks ago and my grandma had a trigger finger repaired today. Mom told Gram I would take care of her. But I can't. I'm recovering from my own surgery. Mom sent a really mean text that crushed me and I don't know how to handle this.\n\n ---\n\nUPDATE!!!!!\n\nI just got off the phone with Gram!\n\nShe burst into laughter when I told her all the things Mom had said. Apparently Mom had been planning to \"surprise\" her with a $200 bidet because she was convinced Gram would have trouble cleaning herself. Gram said she found out about it accidentally and has been making fun of my mother since.\n\nShe said she doesn't need anything outside of opening fresh water bottles (she refuses to drink anything but Poland Springs) and said her neighbor already pre-loosened a bunch of them. Mom had talked to Gram's doctor and went worst-case-scenario, basically. Which is... typical, so I don't know why I didn't see that coming. Gram specifically said \"YOU KNOW YOUR MOTHER. You know what she's like. Don't let her work you up. Jesus Christ, if I was going to have that much trouble I would've stayed in the goddamn hospital.\"\n\nShe also said she didn't include me in the group text because I'm not a worrier and wouldn't be losing my shit wondering if she made it through surgery. She said she just updated Mom and my aunt (her daughter) and said she was fine, and that Mom was the one that went off about how she needed help. She also said \"for crying out loud, you just had surgery, you need to take care of yourself\" so she wasn't expecting me to help at all.\n\nGram said she'd love if we could talk more over the next few days since she'll be a little bored and asked if we could play Scrabble Online. All's good.\n\nNow Gram and I have an inside joke about \"surprise bidets\" and I'm waiting for my mother to call in about an hour. I've gotten some awesome advice and really appreciate it; I have an idea of what to say now. (I don't want to ignore the call as that'll cause more problems. I KNOW she's going to call me, it's not a question lol)\n",

You are recovering from surgery and she is treating you like this... and it's apparently a pattern of behavior for her to be completely shitty to you. No one deserves to be treated the way your mother is treating you. ",
            "Sounds like your mum sees you as an extension of herself and wants to reap thanks and praise for herself by throwing you under the bus.\n\nThat sucks, sorry. Try telling her that you're really shocked she could be so inconsiderate and selfish but you'll forgive her this time. It probably won't be terribly effective but it might be fun to steal her script. Do a broken record thing, whatever she says on this topic just turn it back to how she was awful and really hurt you but you're willing to let it go.\n\nAnd contact your gran and make sure she's ok, if she's a reasonable person you'll probably feel better about things after hearing from her. You could send an apology to her that you can't do it, and mention that you think your mom forgot about your mastectomy when she volunteered you! \n\nIf you want to detonate a passive aggressive nuclear weapon, send that same apology to all the people who were in the group text. Your mum goes from the woman who saved the day to the woman who forgot about her daughter's major surgery. Might put her off playing these games with you in future.",

If she needs care so badly, your mother can take some time off to do it.",

Your gran knew that you would sacrifice yourself to help her if you could, but she doesn't want you to. That's why you weren't included in the assistance request. \n\nIf you want to help your grandmother and yourself, just give her a call during your recoveries to check in mentally and see how you're each going. I'm sure giving emotional support to each other is doable, even just so your gran has a chance to vent over whoever else is taking care of her.\n\n> Now I feel like everyone thinks I'm a selfish monster and am depressed to the point of feeling sick.\n\nOnly your mother thinks this, everyone else is clever enough to know that 2 x sick people taking care of each other does not equal one healthy person.",

If you could go back and do it again, you would be best served by not discussing this at all with your mom and instead calling grandma directly. I'm not saying that you have to hang up on your mom. I'm saying that you should listen to her and then when she starts pressuring you to commit to something, you tell her you're going to call grandma. You can divert the conversation by expressing your feelings instead of agreeing to take action. For example,\n\nMom: So can you help grandma? She needs you!\n\nYou: Oh my goodness! This is really serious! I'm so worried about her. \n\nMom: So you'll go stay with her?\n\nYou: Oh dear! Poor grandma. I'm so worried about her. I better let you go so I can call grandma and talk with her. I'll update you later. Bye!\n\nThen you call your grandma and find out whether she even needs help, explain your situation, etc. Once you know grandma is fine with your choice, it doesn't matter what rude things your mom says.

Not because you are actually doing anything  A couple percent increase in mortgage rates and the whole house of cards crumbles, but you're making her look bad.

I bet if she'd been generous to you, your conflict would be more of the 'what could I have done differently to be there for gram'. But she's not. She's generous with you.\n\nSo, use this as the jump off point to change the dynamic. \n\nCall your mother when you are ready and apologize for your outburst, and tell her you are going to use this opportunity to get to this fixed. Tell her that she is never to volunteer your service to anyone for any reason without your consent ever again. If she thinks it's important she can bring you her ask and you can decide, but if she volunteers you again you will be forced to tell the giftee you've had to have a talk with mother about volunteering your time or whatever without asking, so you're sorry, but it will not be possible for you to do whatever it was she promised them.

            "OMFG your post just gave me serious PTSD flashbacks to conversations I've had with my own mother. Everything from her freaking out over things, then making it my problem, then guilting me and making me feel like a terrible person. Holy crap. I struggled for years as I knew she was a good person and most of the time we had a great relationship, but the bad times had me hysterical, panic attacks and feeling horrible (emails disowning me because of how horrible I'd been, how I was hurting my family and so on) \n\nI had therapists at time telling me I shout cut her out if my life because of how bad she could make me feel, and I was already struggling with anxiety and depression. I resisted because she's a lovely human being and tries her best. \n\nI had a come to Jesus moment beginning of this year that sounds a lot like your above scenario (I was wasting my life and hurting my brother because of money I had borrowed off him). Realised I cared so much about her that I let her get under my skin rather than being able to brush her off when she did or said whacko things. Part of me thought I would turn out like her, and if I could help her and be there for her, it was like helping my future self (I really don't want to be like her in 30 years - she never sought treatment for anxiety and depression like I did). \n\nI have now given up on wishing for the ideal mother daughter relationship where we're best friends and confide in each other. I've stopped feeling guilty about that, I'm still a good daughter, I just keep her at half an arms length. I'm closer to my dad. Anyone who knows my mum knows how emotionally draining she can be. Anyone who doesn't know doesn't need to know details. I'll never be able to always please her, she'll always have moments with me like your scenario, and I mentally do better expecting that than being blindsided and then emotionally killing myself trying to sort out the situation. \n\nI got a lot of inspiration from r/raisedbynarcassists, not because I think she is one, but because it's a place where you can talk about having a toxic relationship with someone who is supposed to love you and accept you unconditionally, and how to deal with interactions like what you've outlined. \n\nBTW my mother in law is fucking awesome and everything my mother is not, so I know it's not me. My mother is the r/JUSTNOMIL in our relationship. When someone who knows your mother well has to make you feel better about her, that's a real red flag to me. My dad made excuses for my mum my whole life (she's just tired, she just really loves you and is scared for you and doesn't express it well, etc). Be careful in the future with taking what she says to heart. She's your mum so of course you listen to her and care about what she has to say, but not all of us have the kind of mum you should be listening to... \n\nRelax, and focus on looking after yourself with your surgery!

Healthy adults are not required to just sit and listen while they are being berated on the phone. Adults can simply hang up if the other person is being unreasonable.

One thing about parents that are emotionally hungry is that they seek their sense of self-value externally from their role as a parent. To validate themselves they act out what's expected of that role, and if that is resisted by others then they feel very offended. The way you define that role depends on a lot of factors, such as personality type, anxiety levels, upbringing, etc. Some parents think their role as a parent is to make all the major decisions for their children and protect them from the world. But that has less to do with the child's well being as it does with the parent's own sense of validation. ",
