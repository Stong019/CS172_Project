I did get her flowers and told her again how I really meant it and she said it's fine and it just sounded weird in the moment. \n\nAlso it's kind of annoying how many people missed that we are two women and start talking about how I said this because I'm a man or make other gendered theories, sorry but you're wrong. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nAnyway it's all fine and I probably didn't need to make this post but oh well now I have silver so that's nice.\n\n___\n\n\nOk so I'm a dumbass. She's actually my first relationship and the first person I had sex with ever, and we are like ridiculously sexually compatible. We've been dating for 5 months now but we knew each other for 2 years as friends before that, and had already developed feelings for each other for a long while. So it definitely feels quite serious already.\n\nBasically we were having sex, actually just got finished, and I just wanted to express how good it was, yknow? So I said 'babe, you're so good you're gonna ruin everybody else for me'. Basically unintentionally saying I'll definitely have sex with other people after her. big oof\n\nLike 1 millisecond after saying it my brain went 'wait.. hold on a sec.. that doesn't sound right' and she was already looking at me weirdly... she said 'wow way to ruin the moment' and then kinda tried to laugh it off and I apologized a thousand times and explained I didn't mean it that way. She tried to just laugh along and play it off like she isn't bothered but she's not a very good actress and I know she's hurt. How do I make up for saying dumb stuff I didn't actually mean that way?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\*\\*tl,dr:\\*\\* I said something stupid to my GF after sex and it ruined the moment and hurt her. How can I make things better and make her believe me?",

            "I think:\nYou're being to hard on the situation. Yeah you kicked up some dust with a bad phrase. But rehashing would just make it worse. \n\nYou've apologised already and that's the best first step. Follow it up with a romantic gesture in your style, flowers, paper crafts, a gift... What ever it may be, but something simple. Finally move on. Be a good partner and continue with integrity.\n\nCertainly a foot in mouth moment but demonstration of commitment will prevail.\n\n\n\nHonestly. You may have to beat it yourself but don't beat yourself up \ud83d\ude05",
            "You say.. WHAT I MEANT WAS:\n\nYou\u2019ve ruined me for any other woman so I\u2019m hoping that you will stay my only one.",
            "People misspeak all the time.  If you can't forgive yourself for it, you have self-esteem problems.  If she can't forgive you, she has self-esteem problems.  Let it go, because trust me, you're going to say a lot of dumb crap that you'll regret in this relationship and in your life, as will she because you're humans.",
            "Oh cmon, this really isn't that bad.\n\nYou're not married and you're in a new relationship. I'd honestly just apologise, state that it was just a dumb way of saying it was incredible sex, and move on.\n\nDon't give yourself such a hard time. I honestly wouldn't think twice if my girlfriend said that to me. It reads as someone looking for the worst interpretation of what you could be saying.",
            "Although I (F) would personally find that hilarious/assume the best in what that person meant, I know not everyone is the same. Choose your moment to bring it up in private conversation with her, explain sometimes you\u2019re very dry/sarcastic, and the ridiculousness that you\u2019d actually be sleeping with others when you\u2019re so incredibly happy with your sex life and being with her is what made that joke funny to you. Then you heard the joke echo in your head after you said it, realised it probably wasn\u2019t received the way it was intended, and that you\u2019re sorry/will be more sensitive in future. Then give her a big kiss and a cuddle and love her up :)",
            "Yea that's absolutely an \"oof\".\n\nYou can't fix it exactly and constantly going over and over it to try will just make it worse.\n\nI assume your intent was to say that no-one else could ever measure up to her?\n\nIf so, and if I had made a similar mistake I would send her flowers with a note saying something like:\n\n\"I'm sorry. I meant you are all I'll ever need\".\n\nDont hate yourself. We all make phrasing mistakes, it's just horrible when our mistakes hurt people we care about!",
            "I agree that you're being hard on yourself here. My husband literally once said to me \"A lot of people really prioritize being with a pretty girl, but I feel so lucky to have you.\" Like, the underlying sentiment is so nice but... bro. That execution. I'm sure I laughed plenty awkwardly at the time and I'm sure he wanted to die as soon as the words left his mouth, but 15 years of showing me through actions that he loves me above all others (and occasionally actually expressing that love in a sensible manner) has far outweighed a single dumb comment.\n\nShow this woman what she means to you. Tell her that it's a good thing you want to be with her forever, since no one else will ever compare. And maybe give yourself a minute before talking after sex. \ud83d\ude01",
            "I once want to express the sentiment \u201cI love you more and more the longer we\u2019re together\u201d. What came out was \u201cI could never love you any less than I do right now\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ve been married for 25 years, and it\u2019s become a thing we put on our anniversary cards.  :)",
            "I laughed out loud at this. Not to be mean but because it's obviously just an accident that could happen to anyone. I did something similar once when I was with someone for a few months and intended to stay with them long term. I think it just takes all the bits of your brain to catch up sometimes.",
            "These things happen. \n\nI once had a guy say, \u201cGod, I\u2019m going to tell our grandchildren about this.\u201d\n\nI opened my mouth and probably the worst thing I could have said fell out. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure as hell not having your children, man.\u201d\n\nWe stared awkwardly at one another, laughed unconvincingly and went out for ice cream.",
            "That is a really common phrase people use to express how good something is and isn't meant literally. I think you should tell her once how much she means to you and then let it go.",

            "First of all stop apologizing and bringing it up. You've said you're sorry, move on. I think that any special gestures right now will only make it weird, as in that you are obsessing about it. Give it some time and let things settle back to normal by themselves.",
            "I think people take things so seriously sometimes. I would have laughed and played along with it. This was clearly non intentional.",
            "If you feel the need to \u201capologize one thousand times\u201d for a joke then maybe you should be a bit more introspective about the relationship and your place in it. \n\nYou say things like \u201cwe are ridiculously sexually compatible\u201d but admit inexperience. This to me further comes off as someone who is in the honey moon phase and not quite thinking things through and admitting their blind spots. \n\nMy point is, if making a small joke actually causes her to be mad (or at the very least makes you feel like you fucked up terribly) then there is a dynamic developing within the relationship that I wouldn\u2019t find healthy. If I were you I would prevent that ASAP. You are clearly putting her on some pedestal. \n\nMoreover, her response of \u201cruining the moment\u201d doesn\u2019t sound like someone who is in true orgasmic bliss. Just my guess, but I get the impression you are looking at this relationship with a blind eye due to the fact you are finally fucking. \n\nGoing forward, my advice is to discuss how you are worried you can\u2019t be yourself and make jokes in front of her. If not, I think you\u2019ll be walking on egg shells the rest of your relationship and apologizing all the time. Enjoy!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m just now reading the rest of the comments now and I find most to be terrible. This is not a \u201coof\u201d or something worth a grand romantic gesture. True compatibility includes being able to joke around. If it\u2019s all in your own head, then you should work on self-esteem. If she is the one who is mad then that is unfortunate. You ought not have to worry about offending your partner and having to buy back her happiness with flowers / dates. Dates are meant to be a fun night ought with a person you want to be around, not a bargaining chip. Also buying jewelry? Lol we clearly have materialistic people in this thread giving absolutely shit self-motivated advice.",
            "My boyfriend is a really smart guy, but like you he sometimes doesn't \"English\" things very well. He'll recognize it, like you did, more often than not. Or I'll ask him to clarify what he meant.\n\nYou've been with her 5 months and known her 2 years. This may be the most embarrassing time you've done this, but I doubt it's the first.\n\nI would have one more conversation about it, let her know how you really feel and that it was a clumsy way of saying how much you enjoyed being with her. And then drop it. It was a minor slip and not worth getting so worked up over.",
            "Ok, I don't think that's a big oof. It was saying you wouldn't want anyone besides her. It doesn't need to imply that you'd be with anyone else at all. You apologized, just move on. Don't refer to it again unless she brings it up. Don't try to fix her mood. Just move on.",
            "Tbh, if my (F) bf told me that i'd be pretty taken aback so... i think you kinda messed up but it's not a TERRIBLE situation that can't be salvaged. just keep showing her that you love her and reassuring that it's a joke :)",
            "I say stupid things to my wife during sex all the time. She knows that when all my blood is flowing to the head downstairs, the head upstairs doesn't get enough blood supply.\n\nWe all make embarrassing jokes at times, don't take it serious. And if she does take it serious tell her to grow up.",
            "my boyfriend and i say this kind of thing all the time. usually in the context of \u201cif you die... i\u2019ll never have good sex again!\u201d so i get where the compliment comes from. that being said...\n\ni think if you press it you\u2019re just gonna make it worse. she was trying to laugh it off, so it sounds like you just need to let it go. if it hurt her feelings, it seems that she understands it\u2019s not what you meant and if you continue to INSIST how sorry you are it could become \u201ca thing\u201d when it should just be a passing moment of awkwardness.\n\njust continue to show her how you care about her through your actions and try not to say something that can be taken negatively like that again. don\u2019t obsess over this unless she brings it up again",
            "This will blow over. Trust me.\n\nWhen I first got with my now husband I thought i'd say something 'cute' to him (I was such a cliche teenager)\n\nI meant to say 'you're too good for me' whilst cuddling.\n\nWhat my tired brain actually said was 'i'm too good for you'.\n\nLuckily he knew I was a dimwit by this point and laughed it off whilst I just apologised profusely. I still think about it from time to time wondering why on earth I'd say such a thing in the first place.",
            "I mean, I've said similar things to my girlfriend. She's the first person who's been able to give me an orgasm and so I joke with her that I can never break up with her because nobody else makes me feel that good. I think if you explain to her that THAT'S what you meant, and not that you are planning to break up with her and have worse sex as a result, then you're good.",
            "This is one of those situations where I think your response can set the tone for how she feels about it.\n\nIf you act like it's incredibly embarrassing and hurtful, she'll probably take it that way. After all, you'd only react badly that if you meant it on some level, right? \n\nIf you laugh it off - acknowledge that it was a crummy way to phrase it but otherwise treat it like a silly accident, she'll most likely realize you didn't have any deeper meaning to your words and will relax. \n\nIt's like if I joked about cheating on my SO and they laughed it off vs. looking guilty and/or awkward. Their reaction influences my reaction.",
            "I think you're overthinking this .  I think she took it as a joke, laughed with you about it, and is ok with that remark..",
            "Don't beat yourself up too much over this, ok? Yes it was bad phrasing, but not more than that. You obviously meant to compliment her. \n\nI'd try a nice gesture, like buy her her favorite candy or something comparable and put on a small note that says \"I'm sorry for the brain fart, I meant you're all I'll ever need. Love you.\" Or something. \n\n  \nYou'll be fine, this is really harmless :)",
            "Just leave it be, or bring it up one more time to apologize and leave it. I also don't think it's that bad, but moreso because you've already apologized and it seems like she's trying to move on. You just have to be like, 'Sorry, that comment is still weighing on me, I just want to reiterate again I just fucked up saying how good the sex is and that you're still my one and only and I'm serious about us.' \n\nI mean you were basically saying 'I'm so glad you were my first' and said it weirdly, I wouldn't beat yourself up so much for it.",
            "This is the kind of thing that happens when both heads aren't communicating.",
            "Apologize and move on.  If you're really that good for each other, hiccups like this won't ruin it.",
            "I don't think it's bad at all, but then again, this is know your audience. If your lady doesn't have that kind of sense of humor, then she might take offense to it. My ex-husband (ironic, I know) and I used to make jokes like that all the time. \n\nAll you have to do is be honest with her, earnest. Maybe buy her some flowers or something, just show that you appreciate her and you're not going anywhere.",
            "I did this to my wife a couple times when we were dating. I apologized. Honestly though she sort of learned that my sex brain can\u2019t really convey the words that I ACTUALLY would want to say. It was a mess up. And you were high on endorphins. It maybe hurt her feelings, but y\u2019all have so much time to learn each other. Just apologizing is a big thing. But treat her to something sweet anyways, for the simple fact that you are into this lady.",
            "I find that the cure for foot-in-mouth disease is a combination of sweet and funny/cheesy- to re-lighten the mood. So I'd do something like a bouquet of flowers and hand them to her while wearing a cone hat that says \"dunce\".",
            "That sounded like a freudian slip to me, lol. I would have definitely been upset if I were her.",
            "Once I was on a date at a movies and there was a Brittany Spears Pepsi commercial and my date said \"if I could have sex with her I'd be willing  to die immediately after\".  \n\nThis same person also said \" when you and the kids go on vacation without me, it's the best time of my life.\"\n\nYup, I married the guy.  Zero regrets because he's awesome.  We all say stupid stuff.  If you can't work through it that says a lot more than the stupid thing you said, because it will happen again eventually.",
            "Try not to beat yourself up so much about it. At the end of the day, if she says she's okay, you're going to have to believe her until she tells you otherwise. You've made step one to repair your relationship after a misunderstanding by apologizing. Now you can ask her what she needs from you to feel like things between you are okay. I love the suggestions other people have said (flowers, a gift, ect), but you can also always just tell her you feel bad about what you said and you'd like to know what she needs to feel secure in y'alls relationship. Communication and forgiveness/compassion for both of you is key to maintaining balance and health in the relationship :)",
            "I honestly didnt even think to take it that way until you explained it and then thought, Ya i can see where shes coming from but it sounds like you def didnt mean it that way and I think its best to do your best to express to her thats what you truly meant. Eventually she will look at it as a simple poor word choice.",
            "It was stupid, but I feel like any sane girl would be able to realize that you probably didn't mean it *like that.* Maybe just bring it up on more time later on, saying something like, \"Look I feel really dumb over what I said before. I just wanted to let you know that I truly didn't mean it like that. I was trying to say..... and my brain just phrased it in a dumb way.\" \n\nI'm sure she'll be able to let it go.",
            "It was an honest mistake & if you really do feel strongly about her to the point where you DO think that there's a possibility that she will be the only person you ever date/sleep with, I would sit her down and clarify this point.\n\nPeople here are saying to just do a nice gesture for her, but I don't see a reason why you couldn't do both. The important thing is that she fully understands that it was a fudge up on your part & that you are putting in the effort to show her that it was just a bad exchange of words.\n\nWhile this is something small/minor, if you love your partner I don't think you want to leave her second guessing you or your feelings towards her. Small things like these tend to build up & if the tables were turned I think you would probably feel hurt too.",
            "You tried to compliment her, but you used a bad phrase.  Since you apologized to her just make it up her with a gift or a special date.",
            "A simple \u201cshit, that\u2019s not how it sounded in my head\u201d should be fine. \n\nMove on. Not a big deal IMO.",
            "I'm a guy. And I've said countless dumb things and I pretty much have the same reaction u did.. realizing how dumb it was 1 millisecond after It left ur mouth. \nJust apologize and tell her u didn't mean it that way, and in time she will let it go. Just keep being good to her and show her that she's the one you want.",
            "If it makes you feel any better, one time I jokingly asked my fianc\u00e9 if he\u2019d find some really smart girl in his computer science program at school and dump me for her, and his response was \u201cpsh, I\u2019d never date anyone as smart as me.\u201d\nI watched him realize what he said. It could\u2019ve been on r/watchpeopledieinside.",
            "Lol sometimes stuff like that happens.   Hopefully she understands it was your way of saying how good it was. My boyfriend has said something similar about having kids and I jokingly asked who he was having them with. It's about communication and if it's good you should be a ok.",
            "Just tell her it is because you fear she will leave you one day, not that you plan on breaking up with her.",
            "\u201cBabe, you\u2019re going to ruin everyone else for me, so I\u2019d better not ever take you for granted or give you a reason to leave. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m dumb sometimes, you\u2019re amazing and sometimes, I just don\u2019t think straight when I\u2019m with you.\u201d",
            "Agree with other commenters. The key here is to focus on bringing more positive, considerate experiences into your relationship to demonstrate how into her you are. What does she like to do? Take her out to her favorite restaurant, go on a nice hike, put some effort into doing something that she\u2019ll appreciate. That\u2019ll go a long way towards continuing to build your relationship.\n\nDo *not* rehash your recent negative foot in mouth experience with her, unless she still seems to be upset about it and it\u2019s affecting your relationship.",
            "One time as a teen, I was having an argument with my mom. I don't recall what it was about or what she said, but she zinged me with something. In response, I said \"Wow, rapist wit.\" I of course meant to say rapier wit, sarcastically. But, because I had seen the film Dumb and Dumber so many times, the malapropism came out of my mouth instead.\n\nPoint being, people in TV and movies say some variation of 'you've ruined me' all the freaking time. Sometimes the brain just throws out something familiar, kinda like saying 'you too' to the ticket taker that told you to enjoy the movie. \n\nExplain that to her once, then move on.   People misspeak all the time. If you treat it like a big deal and make grand gestures of apology , then it will be interpreted as a big deal.",
            "My boyfriend when we first started dating straight up told me he wanted to see his female friend naked. He was stupid, high, and not thinking about the words coming out of his mouth. It did cause insecurities but I got over it. This is nothing like that, and she will get over it too. Don't be so hard on yourself.",
            "Honestly it's an immature relationship problem. Yes when I was that age I would have been pissed if my boyfriend said that because deep down I was scared he was cheating on me or going to leave me for someone else anyway.\nBUT now that I'm married and more mature that would just be a funny everyday joke.\n\nI think it's just cause the relationship is new and scary.\nDon't beat yourself up over it. Either she'll get over it and all will be well or she won't and she'll dump you and quite frankly that's a bullet you want to dodge if she leaves you for that.\n\nIt was a funny joke, not like you said someone else's name lol",
            "My boyfriend and I make these jokes sometimes and just laugh at each other or say something back but in a humorous way. I think you need to establish what she\u2019s sensitive to, tell her you love her and assure her it was just like a small chirp",
            "If my husband said that I\u2019d laugh it off and say \u2018well too bad you\u2019re going to suffer once I leave your sorry ass\u2019 and then we would laugh - But that\u2019s just our dynamic. \n\nOp you\u2019ve already apologised, there\u2019s not much else you can do. Time will heal.",
            "I echo a lot of what others have said - you\u2019re okay here and I think it\u2019ll blow over. Sometimes we as humans are fighting wars with doubts and fears that we aren\u2019t outwardly sharing - my guess is that this entered her brain as \u201cthis is proof of a preexisting doubt or worry or fear that I\u2019ve been trying to dispel or ignore.\u201d \n\nI would take this as an opportunity to communicate. Maybe she has insecurities or worries about the relationship; maybe she has past experiences that make this a tender spot; maybe it just hit wrong in the moment. If it were me, I\u2019d try to have a heart to heart. \u201cI can tell my comment earlier hurt you a lot and I want to talk through it together. I know you know I\u2019m sorry; I understand that my sorryness doesn\u2019t fix anything. Can we talk about how I can help you feel better and or more secure? I want you to feel as wonderful with me as I feel with you.\u201d or something to that effect. If she\u2019s not a good communicator or doesn\u2019t want to engage, leave it be and know that you opened the door, and if the relationship is worth keeping, she\u2019ll come to you when she\u2019s ready or able.\n\nBe gentle with yourself.",
            "You're being too hard on yourself. It was just a silly slip up. Hopefully she realizes this",
            "You're too hard on yourself. Yes, comments like this hurt. My boyfriend does it quite often, but I can see that it's just him being dumb and not thinking in advance. She'll get over it, but she might tease you because of it. Just think before you speake",
            "If either one of you took that the wrong way, you're too sensitive. You paid her a compliment. The end",
            "Not to be rude but this \u201cproblem\u201d seems pretty juvenile. \n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine this offended someone who has sincere feelings for you that much, especially bc you clarified it was a mistake.",
            "Said something stupid. \n\nApologized. \n\nMove on. \n\nIf she can't, she's imagining marrying you and having your babies and stuff, which is equally weird for a 24 year old, after 5 months of dating. \n\n\nTell her to calm down. KIDDING, DO NOT TELL HER THAT.",
            "It's not that big of a deal you already apologized and she'll get over it so don't overthink",
            "As others have said, I think you're being hard on yourself, OP. Maybe it did sting her a little, but she clearly tried to make it seem like it was fine, so she probably didn't feel like making it a big deal.\n\nI'm not sure how long ago it happened, but I think time is your best bet, here. Time, and obviously showing her affection.",
            "Be kind to yourself.\n\nYou said something pretty stupid in the moment, but everybody has done that at least once in their lives. You owned up to it and apologized immediately. This will blow over. Moving forward, just think before you speak.",
            "My boyfriend says I\u2019ve ruined other girls for him too\u2014I think it\u2019s really sweet! Let her think it over; she\u2019ll come around to seeing what you actually meant.",

Maybe just explain to her that you feel like an absolute tit and you\u2019re really sorry, that you really didn\u2019t mean it in that way. She will get over it but I\u2019d definitely make it clear what you were trying to say, especially now she\u2019s had some time to calm down. Also, idk if this is her first relationship too as you mentioned it\u2019s yours, but honestly boys say the dumbest things which if she doesn\u2019t know yet, she will soon. Brain and mouth do not engage sometimes - I think it\u2019s a special male talent. 9/10 yous don\u2019t mean it (the good ones anyway).",

Honestly there are no rules to being a decent boyfriend but talking about a future with someone else in it is going to create some distance or create a conversation piece. Moving forward I would suggest trying not to bring it up again and possible just doing all you can to simply enjoy the time you have together. It\u2019s not the end of the world honestly, but you should know that sometimes we say things that we think will mean one thing but instead mean another when we are being vulnerable. Might have put a damper on the ethereal vibes you all had going but it should be okay if you just try to avoid talking about a future that doesn\u2019t include the person you\u2019re with. And when flirting I guess try less to sound cool and harder to sound like you.",

A quick update\n\nI drove to my ex's parents' house on Tuesday and took her the rest of her stuff.  It started out bumpy because her dad met me on the driveway and argued with me about what he sees as my sister being a spoiled brat and turning me against his daughter.  As soon as I started losing it and raising my voice my ex ran out and sent him inside the house.\n\nI told her we're over and I'm moving on.  She made some empty threats but I just told her to do what she has to do and walked away.  That night I took the suggestion repeated here to take my sister  for ice cream and apologize.  She chose Frugos instead (as usual) so we went there and I explained how sorry I was and that I will be better.  I told her that I totally believed her.  She was happy to hear everything I had to say.  It makes a huge difference to a child when you give a sincere apology I could tell.  She even texted a couple of her friends to gloat that my ex was gone.\n\nOkay now the hard part.\n\nOn Wednesday I took her to the park to kick the soccer ball around and to have an overdue talk with her.  I asked her about my ex and she told me that she was mistreated by her more than I knew about.   She had a lot to say about her time at mom's house during the time when I was away.  I didn't know how hard it was for her when I enlisted and left.  That was hard to hear.  It was kind of a move to get myself out of a situation with zero thought to leaving her behind.  The short version is that we have all failed her badly.  She didn't say it but just everything she has to say about how things have gone down around her made it clear.\n\nWhen I was first discharged I got good job working for the city.  But I was drinking every weekend and my house was the hang out spot for my friends and that's how I met my ex.  I was even drinking on a lot of week nights.  I didn't immediately take my sister with me even though I knew about how my mom was living.  My wake up call was when my sister called me because the cops were there looking for mom to question her, and her boyfriend.  That was when I finally cleaned up, rented a house close to my sister's school and brought her to live with me.\n\nShe doesn't remember that I waited so long to bring her with me.  She remembers it as if I acted quickly which is totally false and makes me look way better than I was.  It was really shocking and brutal to hear things from her perspective.  She has been through more than I can have imagined.  She is a very strong person.\n\nSo definitely no more girlfriends for me for a long time.  That was an emotionally expensive lesson to learn with everything that my sister had to go through while I was being blind and dumb.  I'm going to wait and literally become a monk until she is in college.  She gets so many straight A's with some B's here and there.  She has a bright future.  \n\nEDIT:  I'm sure I'll date someday again.  Right now I'm not ready, not even close.  I might be a few months away from changing my mind but a couple of years is more likely.\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr; My girlfriend was mean and awful to my sister.  I broke up with her.  She's gone forever.  My sister and I are closer and I'll be better. **  ",

So get advice! Have someone who you can talk to if you have a question. You could even take a parenting class, anything. Just get some guidance. ",
            "First, I'm glad things are better for you and your sister.\n\n\n>The short version is that we have all failed her badly.  She didn't say it but just everything she has to say about how things have gone down around her made it clear.\n\nBut it's not your fault. Seriously. Your parents are the ones who f*cked up here, not you. I mean, come on, what 21-year-old is responsible enough to take care of an 11-year-old? Most 21-year-olds I know are busy trying to figure out their own lives and don't have the perspective or maturity to take care of anyone other than themselves (and even some don't do that very well, either). Recognize that you stepped in right when you were supposed to, and don't beat yourself up for not doing anything sooner.

Any drama I that occurs between you and a future GF are going to be so small compared with everything else she's endured.\n\n\n>So definitely no more girlfriends for me for a long time.  That was an emotionally expensive lesson to learn with everything that my sister had to go through while I was being blind and dumb.  I'm going to wait and literally become a monk until she is in college.\n\nI think this is extreme, and I urge you to reconsider. No one knows what the future holds. To deny yourself happiness and love with someone special could cause lots of anguish and generate resentment towards your sister. Be careful you don't put aside your own needs. Instead, be thoughtful and considerate of everyone involved, including you. Trust me, I have abandoned my own needs for years. It's not worth it.\n\n\n>EDIT:  I'm sure I'll date someday again.

You were still a kid - have compassion for yourself and take care :)",
            "I realize this probably isn't the type of feedback you're looking for (and will likely get buried), but I feel I need to mention this... I've been in your sister's place.  Granted, probably not the exact same circumstances, but I grew up with a mother who never wanted me and seemed to believe she needed my life to be miserable just like hers (dad was never around).  I was an only child and would've given ANYTHING to have someone (big brother or, frankly, any adult) take me seriously and help me out.  Giving your sister a safe place to stay is an incredible thing to do.  I know she's only 11, but she certainly sees the changes you've had to make.  The little things you've done - moving closer to her school, getting her help, etc. - they matter too.  Sure, it took you time to make those things happen, but being willing to put in that effort means a lot.\n\nAnother comment (a few people have said this) - not dating anyone else might not be the best idea, and not just for you, but for your sister too.  I know you feel like you're doing it for her, but if she's prone to guilt issues, she might think the reason you're staying single is because she's not good enough somehow.  I don't know how to phrase this properly (it's odd explaining something that is irrational...), and maybe this is more specific to me (my mom always told me I was the reason her life sucked, so maybe I'm just really prone to guilt issues), but you should work on your own life, too.  Or maybe have a conversation with your sister about why you're staying single - I mean, when she moved in, you were living with someone and were in a somewhat serious relationship (?), and she's related to why you broke up with the girl.  You don't want her to end up thinking she's the reason you're stalling in your own life....Bleh, I really have no idea how to explain this well.  \n\nPlus, it's always good for someone to see how to properly handle relationships (both when the relationship is good and when it's bad).  For me, all I ever saw of relationships was stuff you shouldn't do, and then that's how I acted in my first few attempts at relationships.  Sure, I *knew* some of the stuff was wrong, but if I was in an argument with a partner, well...I tend to act before I think, and that didn't always go well.  It took a lot to un-learn what I'd witnessed/experienced as a kid.\n\nAnyway, I think it's really admirable what you're doing.  If you ever need money help (maybe I'm reading wayy too much into some of your comments), feel free to PM me an amazon wishlist or something.  I'd rather spend money on people making a real difference (especially with parental abuse being something that I'm pretty opinionated about) than on more alcohol for me.",

Don't squander that opportunity. The bigger takeaway from this story, and I'm 300% sure you know this already, is that your sister is trustworthy, so you can take what she says at face value, which will be immensely valuable when finding a partner. \n\nGood luck.

            "-------**OP PLEASE READ**----------\n\nI hope this doesn't get buried, but OP, please, please, please try your best to support your sister. She needs it so much.\n\nI had a similar past to your guys's. My mom was mentally unstable, abused drugs, the whole nine yards. The cops were at our house all the time... Needless to say, I have some lingering issues. What's even more heart-wrenching is that so do my siblings. I try my best to support them in any way that I can but it's tough being away while going to school... I have dreams of having them move in with me haha\n\nAnyway, I'm sharing this with you because I was split apart from my siblings when we were removed by Child Protective Services. The family I was placed with didn't understand my endeavors and shunned me. Depression is a real issue that shouldn't be shunned. Unfortunately, my issues only spiraled.\n\nI hope to God that your sister doesn't develop anything too harsh since she is so young but please, for her sake, always understand that she was put through extremely unfair circumstances that she didn't ask for and was alone for quite a lot of it. That's traumatizing and can easily resurface.\n\nTaking her in is more than just ensuring she has a roof over her head without cops pestering her. It sounds like you already are nurturing her and I IMPLORE you to continue doing that with love. Love is key to ending any sort of leftover pain that might come as a result of this kind of thing. In situations like your sister's, I'm sure she feels alien to the rest of the world. After all, who has the cops coming over to their home looking for their drug addict mom? I mean no disrespect to your family, I'm just saying it for what it is. Genuinely loving her and looking out for her best intentions will go so far and help her so much.

Take as much time as you need to recover from this relationship but you don't need to swear off them completely, just use it as a learning experience.

            "Throwitaway562323, I'd like to tell you my story with leaving my younger sibling behind in a bad situation with my parents. I want to tell you in hopes that it will give you a basis of comparison, so that you know whatever decisions you have made that affected your sister-- all these decisions are okay. (Ie: you didn't abandon her by enlisting. You were young, it's hard enough to take care of yourself as a new adult with a tough family situation that you removed yourself from for the sake of your (mental) health.)\n\nAbout 10 years ago, I left my home state of NJ to go to college in NC. I figured 600+ mi away would give me physical distance from my parents in order to save my sanity. I did not know at the time, that my parents basically had problems from Day 1, and as the years went on, they slowly poisoned themselves and by association their children (me, then age 17, my brother age 10). Before I left for college I saw my brother being terrorized by my mother, hanging upside down by his feet over a concrete floor. This was not even the event that got me located by a police officer in Borders, and called in for questioning about my parents and their ability to parent. When I was being questioned I was very troubled about \"the right thing to do\". I knew that if I told the police the whole truth, my parents would likely lose custody of my brother (and me?). But which would be more beneficial to my brother? Breaking up my family and putting him through child services? Or keeping them together by omitting details? In the end, I told them enough information to keep them interested in building a case. \n\nMy brother was out of my parent's custody for a month and stayed with relatives. My mother and brother went to family counseling. Somehow, my father, who is definitely the more dysfunctional one, wiggled out of family counseling. My parents regained custody of my brother. \n\nAll the while, I went to college, flirted with boys, exploded my brains with knowledge, locked myself out of my dorm room, drank on the weekends, and basically acted like a regular college student. Only when I woke up early on the weekend to a quiet campus did I have to live with what I had done ... abandoning my brother, leaving him defenseless with parents who couldn't parent that well because they were compatible partners. \n\nNow, 10 years later, my brother has made me SO PROUD. He works two part-time jobs (he's 21) and one of them is a teaching/babysitting-type role at a Boys and Girls Club, which he loves. My brother, like me, is very interested in helping troubled kids because he was one. My mother turns out to actually be a decent human being when she's not married to my father. My father ... is still kind of robot, but I've made peace with him. (My therapist thinks my father may have autism)\n\nSo, Throwitaway562323, here is what I hope you take away from my story:\n1) Take care of yourself first. Then you can take care of other people.\n2) Do not expect the same level of competency of 18 y/o you as you might an older adult. Everyone does dumb/trivial/random shit when they're in their teens/early 20's.\n3) You do not have to have all your shit together to be a good person. You do not have to make up for your parents parenting mistakes with your sister.\n4) Their parenting probably negatively influenced you too ... get some counseling as soon as reasonably possible. Find someone who works on a \"sliding scale\" is finances are limited. Or find someone who is still in the process of getting their degree in Social Work or Psychology and use their services, which should be steeply discounted. \n\nSource: 28 y/o F with messed up parents.

My sisters and I grew up in a very bad household, and none of the organizations involved with our case were doing much to help us, especially considering I'm the middle and I have an older sister so they deemed us to be of age to do something about it (without help), so we had tried to emancipate my younger sister and move out somewhere by ourselves.

No one really expects a 21 year old kid to raise his sibling, and that you have decided to do that is awesome. And go date when you're ready, not in 10 years--your situation was less than ideal in that your girlfriend was already with you when you took your sister in, so you hadn't vetted her yet for the issues that could arise with your sister there. That won't be a problem with future girlfriends because you'll be able to evaluate them in the context of being the guardian for your sister and form bonds more naturally. I know so many parents who chose their new lover over their own children, so someone like you who did the right thing, is heartwarming. \n\nAlso, your girlfriend had her father intercept you and argue on her behalf about why you should take her side over your sister's...!

I understand your sister is very important,  but no girl should ever change this.  However even if you don't realize it you may begin to resent your sister because she is in the way of you having another person in your life.  I realize this may not seem like something you'd think up,  however we have much less control over the underside of our mind,  our near the surface subconscious,   so tread careful with that, cos it'll creep up without you even knowing.   This happens a lot to a divorced parent who don't have the support of the other in child rearing.   It is bad for you and her.  \n\nThis doesn't mean rush out to find a girl,  just don't let there be a wall standing between you and something that could be good for you and your sister both,  simply because you've decided not to date for her sake.",

But if your sister is a good kid and doesn't disrupt y'all's life too much and the ex knew about her situation she could have been a bit more compassionate. \n      I think that you can still date, even though you're essentially the loco parentis now. Just be upfront about your situation with the girls you date and make sure they're cool with it. And believe it or not, there are other 21 year old girls out there (like me) who love kids and would have no problem being a de facto step mom.",

            "Who the f is that sick to do that to a kid like that. Wow, glad you got rid of her, what a Psycho. ",
            "[removed]",
            "Wow, you really fucked up with your sister in so many ways.\n\nBut it takes a man to admit it, and change it. Just stop fucking up. Good luck."

I received many great offers and decided to move several states away to work with a well known PI in my field whom my advisors greatly respect.  After enduring a couple months of long distance and uncertainty, we learned today that my (now) fiance got his dream job in the city I moved to.  Not only does he get to remain a government employee, but his salary is also significantly higher than what he was making before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for all your encouragement and replies.  It gave me the push I really needed to take that dive to move cross country for a new job.  In the end, it really paid off and we finally get to move on with the rest of our lives together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I decided to take Reddit's advice to take a job in another state.  My now fiance found his dream job there and will be following me down to the city I currently live in.",

            "Yay! The two of you have successfully solved the two-body problem. The fact that you two had the communication skills to get through this first time is a very promising sign that you will successfully weather the other decisions to move that you will be facing in the years to come. Twenty-five years ago, I was where you are now. Best of luck for your future and career in academia! Source: Full Professor",
            "I had a similar situation with my girl when she was 23 and I was 26. She got accepted into a great PhD program at a top university and she couldn\u2019t not go. We were dating about 5 years at the time. She moved and I lasted 6 months without her, quit my job and left my family and friends to move in together. My skills are universal so I found a great job making more money in my new state about 2 months later. She worked hard, got her PhD in 5 years and landed her dream job back in our hometown.\n\nThat was 25 years ago. We\u2019ve moved twice since then, once back home and then to where we are now. It\u2019s been a great journey and I\u2019d do it again in a minute.",
            "I wasn\u2019t there for the first post but it\u2019s so nice to see an updated that turn out good! Congratulations for you and your boyfriend, I wish you all the happiness \u263a\ufe0f",

            "This update is something I needed this morning. I know that's selfish, but thank you so, so much u/liraelsfire .\n\nI'm across the country (literally - from TX and in NY) currently, with my SO, looking for a place to rent for when we move officially in a month and a half.  This is for my job and I know it's a good choice for me.  But my SO has a lot of reservations, especially about finding a job and about the area we'll be in.  He's onboard for the move, but we were anxious last night after discussing things.\n\nI'm happy to hear it worked out perfectly for you guys and it gives me hope.",
            "This is so wholesome :) congratulations",
            "How incredibly lucky. I'm happy for both of you.\n\nAlso, thanks for an update. Always appreciate those.",
            "My boyfriend will have to move on as well because of his career and it\u2019s me who has to decide if to follow him or not. It\u2019s frightening but I\u2019m sure that once we will know the country we\u2019ll make it works. I wanna be with him and both working... for the healthiness of our relationship.",
            "That's great that it worked out for both of you",
            "Nice work! As a female post-doc myself, it pisses me off to see so many smart women turn down dream jobs because their boyfriends/husbands don't want to move for them. I know so many female academics who have moved for their husbands/boyfriends! So thank you for a happy opposite story. Glad it worked out for the two of you, and continue kicking ass in your field!",
