        "selftext": "Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3mqmvs/i_34f_suspect_my_husband_34m_is_having_an_affair/), but it's locked. I'm not sure if you can see it or not, but the tl;dr was I suspected my husband of having an affair with our mutual friend (Jade, who is married to Fred, who was a friend of my husband's), but I had no physical evidence.\n\nSo yesterday I tracked my husband with gps and watched where he was going during the day. When I saw that he was in a car (travelling fast down a road to out of town), I casually texted him and asked what he was up to. He said he was walking to the store, which was in the opposite direction of where he was headed. I watched him all day. Stopping here and there, going out to eat with her, travelling all over the place. I would periodically text him to make conversation, and he would lie the entire time. At one point he said he was just walking around the neighborhood thinking about \"us.\" My blood was boiling. I knew he was with someone who had an iPhone because there were no calls or texts made that morning, so he must have communicated via iMessage. Jade has an iPhone. I highly suspected he was with her, but I had no proof. After he was dropped off at home he texted me saying he was sorry for being distant today, he was just doing a lot of thinking. I didn't tell him I knew he was lying the whole day because I had planned to gather more evidence.\n\nLater in the evening I couldn't take it any more. I asked him where he was all day, and he said \"What do you mean, I told you I was walking around.\" In my rage I said \"I know you are lying. I know where you've been.\" He admitted to spending a little time with Jade, that they went and grabbed something to eat. I told him I knew about everywhere he went. I knew about the late night phone calls (while I was watching him yesterday I checked the phone records and saw an unbelievable amount of calls going back and forth between them. I don't know why I didn't think to check the call records on Monday). I knew about the secret private messages on social media. I knew about it all. He confessed that he and Jade have gotten really close and spend a lot of time together, talking. At first he said it was innocent. I told him if it was innocent, he wouldn't be lying and sneaking around. He agreed and admitted he knew what he was doing was wrong.\n\nI texted Fred last night and told him everything I knew. He said he had been uncomfortable with their friendship for a while, but didn't know if I was or if I even knew. We talked for a while, but I don't know what they are going to do. All I know is I am getting a divorce. My husband claims their relationship was never physical but I can never trust him again. No matter what he does or where he goes, I will always question who he is with and if he's lying to me. I cannot and will not spend my life tracking my husband and making sure he is where he says he is, and isn't sneaking around with other women.\n\nI deleted and blocked Jade off of all my social media accounts. I didn't text her or say anything to her. I know if I even tried I would end up saying some pretty foul stuff to her, which she deserves, but I'm better than that. So not only did I lose an extremely shitty friend in this whole thing, I am also losing my best friend, the love of my life, and the father of my children. I am destroyed.\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: He admitted to emotional infidelity, but nothing more. That was enough for me. He has broken my trust irreparably and we are going to divorce.",

Sorry it turned out like this OP but you're right about trust. To me it always reminds me of that Brady Bunch episode where they broke the vase and glued it back together. It still ended up leaking. ",
            "I hear Fred is available.",
            "You did the right thing OP - the overnight trips were likely the times it got physical. There were countless other opportunities too! :/\n\nDidn't he fight for the marriage at all?",
            "I know it's bleak and scary for you right now... but this is not how your life will look.  Somewhere in the future you'll look back and actually be grateful for this to have happened.  You are going to experience things, find inner strength you never knew existed, and come out the other side a better, stronger, wiser person.  Trust me!\n\nWhen I was in my early 30s I found myself a single mom with an ex who declared he'd '*drag me through court and make me spend every penny I had*' which I believed because he came from a well-off family and he had the education and money-making career going for him.  I didn't.  I was an insecure, frightened, financially challenge mess.  Whoa... did I ever discover a different me!\n\nHere's some things that worked for me, so maybe keep these in mind as you move forward:\n\n* If you can afford therapy, go.  What I discovered about myself, and why I married who I married (so I wouldn't repeat the mistake) changed the trajectory of my life.  It also sent me off on a journey of discovery and self-awareness which has been fascinating.\n\n* If you can't afford therapy, read.  Go to the library.  It's free.  Read autobiographies about people who have gone through adversity and come out the other side.  You may read a dozen books till an author resonates with you... but there are people who have taken this path before you and are now showing you the way.  Find someone who you can relate to.  (For me it's my dog-eared copies of \"Broken Open, How Difficult Times Can Help Us Grow\" by Elizabeth Lesser, and \"The Power of Now\" by Eckhart Tolle that helped me.)\n\n* Accept help and support from family and friends.  \n\n* Anger and fear and worry are not good places to make decisions from.  When you are making plans, whether long or short term, do your best to brush the emotional shroud away from your thinking.  Do what's best for your kids, for you... and don't do something to specifically hurt your ex.  That's just wasted energy.\n  \n* Don't speak ill of your children's father.  That helps no one and your kids will remember when they're older.\n\nBuckle down and accept the fact that your life will now look different.  But the good thing is that from here on in, you are the driver and in control.  Look out into the future and decide what you want that to look like, and then set off on this new journey.  It's a long road but you can do it.\n\nFYI, I'm now 60, happily single, mortgage and debt-free, retired, enjoying a wonderful friendship with my adult son... and am living a life far better than I ever dreamed possible.  But it took some sacrifice, some hard decision making, and patience in believing things would get better.  Then somewhere along the line the scales tipped in my favour (WAY in my favour) and everything paid off.  I truly believe you can eventually have all this too.  \n\nGood luck!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

My dad was dying of cancer and I could not focus on a \"real\" relationship. So I ate up every single thing he told me. The kicker was his jealousy when I went on vacation with my male BFF and he acted like we shouldn't be sleeping in the same bed together. WTF?\n\nHot Married Guy and I never had sex but looking back had I been his wife and seen those 100s of emails over the course of several months it would not have seemed that way.\n\nThey eventually divorced, after we had not talked in years.  I thought that meant an open door for us to be together. We went out once. Then he ghosted. True colors.",

The emotional infidelity really hurts,  because when you're in a relationship that emotional bond is meant to be something sacred between partners. I'd say it hurts more than your partner going off and having random, meaningless sex with someone.\n I just want to commend you for your strength and composure throughout this. You will get through this. And remember, this too shall pass.",

If you don't trust them to the point where you have to track their every movement and communication then it's over.

Gawd!\n\nYou mentioned that Fred is wealthy. I don't know if you need a lawyer, but perhaps he could hook you up with a good one.\n\nI think the following is correct, not positive:  don't leave the house for any length of time, don't move out. It can be considered abandonment, and you could risk losing the house. \n\nAnd a shout out to /u/moyyyle, who was helping you with the GPS tracking yesterday, wondering if you could see where your husband had already been, or could only see him in the present:\n\n>No, but wait.

            "It really isn't worth staying in a relationship where all your partner is doing is lying. Even if he  hasn't physically cheated, there's way too much effort going into his lying instead of effort put into making your relationship better. \n\nStaying in the relationship is going to drive you nuts wondering what he's up to. He proved he can't be trusted just by continuous lying. Why would he bother to change now? Because you busted him? Doesn't usually work that way with chronic liars.",
            "I'm so sorry for this. I myself am going through the exact same thing right now. I can't belive that the person I trusted my life, my heart, my future with could do something like this. I am about three weeks in and meeting with lawyers and filing for child support and dealing with mountains of paperwork trying to figure out my options. We have to sell the house, find new places to live, all of that. And while I'm doing all these things, my idiot husband is saying \"Oh I can't take the kids, I have to go out for my sisters birthday this weekend\" I'm only asking him to take them two days a week as a courtesy to the children. My children are not a burden to me but obviously they are to him. Sorry for the venting there. Just be prepared for this to get even uglier. Once he has an ounce of freedom he will most likely take advantage of the situation to live life as he pleases since he knows you will be there to take care of the kids. ",

Even though your mind sounds made up, I want to share my story, because maybe there's a chance that this doesn't have to be the end if your family.\n\n\nMy family went through a very similar situation, except that I'm the daughter and not the wife. The day it all came out is burned into my memory - September 27th. I was 17, that Sunday I came home from work at 2 pm to find my mother laying on her bed and crying. At first she wanted to 'protect' me and not tell me, but I didn't let it go. When she told me - same thing, the phone locations and calls and lies - it felt like everything was over. I couldn't even begin to emotionally process so I found some boxes and started packing - obviously we wouldn't be living here anymore. \n\n\nMy dad came home not long after. However he was feeling about my mom at the time, I think watching me pack while crying and trying to ignore him had an effect. He was willing to fool around but he didn't want to lose his family. The next week was a blur of tears but somehow, the end didn't come. What he did was never forgotten, of course - sometimes my mom has moments where she can't help checking where he is and what he's been doing, and occasionally it rears it's ugly head in arguments - but we still are a family.\n\n\nPlease OP, confront him and ask if losing his family is worth it, and if he's willing to fight for it. Every day I think about how grateful I am that my mom was willing to get past my dad's cheating. Please, for your kids.",

Maybe it's marital counseling, or maybe it's a major life change, but if there's anything that's worth fighting for until the end, it's your marriage and your children.

It's a lifetime of regret, frustration, and second guessing for many, many people.  It's clear many commenting here don't realize this. \n\nI'm always dissapointed to hear the divorced and single people forming a chorus line of \"divorce his ass\" or \"dump that bitch\"... egging on married people with difficulties to just throw it all away. \n\nOP, take your time with the divorce proceedings. Just because he made a series of stupid mistakes does not make him a useless and horrible person. You admit things were problematic before all this. Guys don't typically have lots of people to talk to about emotional problems. Obviously his choice of confidant was poor, and execution was terrible, however you did marry him so there must be something in him that's worthwhile. If not, divorce is always available to the both of you. \n",
            "Honestly you should try counseling before you rush into a divorce.  Turning your life upside down and the life of your kids just because your partner spent time with another woman is kinda dumb.  Even if he did get physical with her, people can and do change.  There is no hard and fast rule that says your husband can't be a loyal and loving partner again, despite what all of the people here are saying.\n\nI feel like people are pressured by society to instantly dump someone that cheated on them to spite them and make sure they don't look bad.  It's kind of like cutting your nose off to spite your face.  You owe it to yourself and your kids, not your husband to at least try.\n\nDon't let the \"white knights\" and the \"you go girl\" crowd here encourage you to rush into anything.

We take vows \"for better or WORSE\" which includes but is not subject to: Trust, loyalty, communication etc. When these things are broken that is when you make the most efforts to work on the relationship. Obviously some things can't be fixed and if he was truly unhappy after effort was put in to make it work. Well then that would be grounds for a divorce. No offense but this is just sad. No effort to build on the trust that's been lost? you're just going to get up and leave that easily. No one is perfect and we all make mistakes. Marriage means nothing to people anymore and it makes me utterly revolted that people waste their time gathering friends and family to watch someone make promises that they don't intend to keep unless it's on THEIR TERMS. Putting all the blame on one person for his lack of communication. What about you? what have you done to push a man to the point he needs to turn to another woman for affection/ attention. So quick to blame it on someone else just because you caught it.

I know that everyone told me that it was a bad idea, but I had to try. I took everyone's advice and made sure that I didn't pay for anything that was extravagant or over the top.\n\nAnyway, last week we went on two dates. We did the whole dinner and a movie thing and we also went to the museum. Earlier this week we went to a play, which sucked, got some food after which we had sex - which has been a long time coming. All was good. Great, actually.\n\nYesterday I went over to her house to bring her lunch. I knew she was home. I picked up some Chinese food and drove to her apartment. I have the spare key to her place, so I opened the door and went in, and see her fucking some guy on the couch. We made eye contact, then I just walked out. She called me like an hour later and told me that we weren't exclusive and that if I didn't want her to be with other guys, that's fine, but I needed to tell her in advance. I told her to get fucked. I don't have time for bullshit like that.\n\nSo that was fun...\n\n**tl;dr**: She had sex with another guy. Claimed it was because we weren't exclusive. We are no mas.",

If she was really invested in making this work (and it wasn't about the money), she wouldn't have been so keen on fucking another guy.

In the past, whenever I would bring up marriage, he would blow off my questions with a joke of something along the lines of \"I don't believe in marriage\". I finally had a conversation with him last year to help clarify if he really meant this or was truly joking. He said he wants to wait until both of us are our best selves. In his case, this meant more financial stability, which he achieved last year with a raise in salary. I was previously really unhappy with my old job and my unhappiness carried over into our relationship, so he was pushing me to switch jobs. I switched jobs in February, but between the current Covid19 situation and having a new manager with unprofessional behavior and gaslighting tactics, I am again stressed out and unhappy. I also gained about 20 pounds at my old job and am not finding success with losing it with how much overtime I still have to do with my new job. He makes comments about my food consumption and about me needing to exercise more. \n\n---\nTLDR: Is 8 years too long? Are we ever going to be our best selves?",

            "I'm sorry you're having a tough time. A few things:\n\n1. Being your best self isn't a state you somehow achieve and then stay in forever.\n2. The true measure of one's relationships is how people support, inspire, defend, and appreciate each other when everything is collapsing around you--in other words, when nothing is perfect, and you are trying and failing to be your best self.\n3. I don't know you, and I couldn't possibly know the complexity and depth of your relationship from one post. At the same time, I want to say without equivocation that I would never want a loved one to marry someone who makes comments about their food consumption, weight, and exercise routines. I have a strong feeling that if he was making **kind and concerned** comments, you would've framed it as such and not simply tagged it on the end. I get the impression that his critiques of your body wear down your self-esteem and enable his movement of goal posts.\n\n**So, what does a kind and concerned comment look like?** \"I'm nervous about bringing this up, because I know it's a sensitive topic for most people, including me. I've noticed you've been depressed because of this job, and it feels like eating more XYZ has become kind of a coping mechanism. What do you think? How do you feel about it?\" **or** \"I've noticed you've been really stressed. Do you want to try this online workout with me before dinner?\" **or** \"I think you're sexy no matter what, but it feels like you've been worried about losing weight lately. Is there anything I can do to be more supportive?\"\n\nIf you wait around long enough and apply enough pressure and make yourself small enough to fit into his little boxes, he might propose to you. I'd be sad for you if he did. Eight years? You deserve someone who cannot wait to marry you. Good luck with everything.",
            "The whole \u201cbest selves\u201d thing is a way to keep moving the goal post on you. Especially when he gets to be the judge of what your best self is.\n\n\nIf marriage is important to you, I would not keep waiting on him. Yes, you want to continually work towards improvement but someone shouldn\u2019t be holding their understanding of \u201cyour best self\u201d over your head in order to move forward with deeper commitment. Especially not after 8 years.",
            "Why would you need to be your best self? Isn\u2019t the point of marriage that you\u2019re both going to support each other to continue improving your life for... the rest of your life? You\u2019ll never be your best self, there will always be room for improvement. Also who\u2019s idea of \u201cbest self\u201d is he basing that off of?",
            "I think he's moving the goal posts, and I genuinely doubt he's ever going to propose. I'm sorry.",
            "This happened with my ex. I ended up breaking up with him. We were together 8 years knew each other for 10. I figured if he wasnt ready after all that time I'm too old to keep wasting it. In another 8 years I'd have no time to meet, marry, and have kids with someone else.",
            "I\u2019m 46. Years old, I can remember thinking in my early /mid /late 30s that I had all the time in the world to settle down and get married and have kids.\n\nYour 30s go by in a flash. one day,  you wake up and you\u2019re 40.  You blink and your 45...\n\nIf by that time you haven\u2019t met the goals of marriage  (if that\u2019s what you want) or kids, (if that\u2019s what you want) then your odds dramatically decrease on having a child of your own. \n\nAnd you find that many of your dating choices after 40 already have a child of their own, or one or two divorces under the belt. \n\nI\u2019m not saying there\u2019s anything wrong with this. Not at all. But I will say as a 46-year-old woman it is much easier to find men to date, Marry, and have children with in your 30s.\n\nYou don\u2019t have time to waste waiting on a man who keeps moving the goal post.",
            "I think it's one thing to have goals and want to hit them, such as finances in a good place, etc. Those make sense. Tangible, concrete goals to help set up your future.\n\nHis  definition is so arbitrary, as other redditors said, the goalpost is just going to keep moving. What does he define as 'best selves'? What are tangible things you and him can do to reach that stage? I have a feeling his answer will be vague and change as your lives change. \n\nAlso, the food and exercise comments seem unwarranted. Different if you asked for his support and help, but his comments sound cruel and hurtful.",
            "There's a difference between, \"I really want to marry you, but now's not the right time. Let's focus on improving your work situation, and waiting for this pandemic to pass, then have this conversation in 6 months time,\" and \"I don't believe in marriage, let's wait until we're our best selves\" bullshit. \n\nIf he'd come back with the first statement, I'd be inclined to believe him. My fiance and I were keen to get engaged, but there were a few years where it was not the right time for us - we both had career and mental health issues to iron out. Once all that was sorted to a point we both felt happy with, my fiance bought the ring...then got unexpectedly fired from his job. I said, \"Well, I guess that delays our plans to get engaged...\" and he said \"fuck it\", put the ring on my finger and said, \"I don't want to let this stop me from living the life I want with you.\" Life will always throw a spanner in your works, even when you're engaged or married, so there's no point in waiting for life to be \"perfect\" unless there is legitimately something you want resolved. I actually asked my fiance the other night, \"Soo...do you feel like you'll be ready to have kids in the next year or two?\" and he said, \"I feel a lot less ready now than I did before this pandemic. I don't think this is a great situation to bring kids into, but I'm really interested in having the conversation again in a few months time when things are a little more settled.\" So, even when you don't feel ready to make a big life change, you can still have conversations where you acknowledge these big life changes are on the horizon.\n\nI don't think that's what your boyfriend is doing. What does \"financial stability\" look like for him? Is there an exact figure? Does it mean \"we have a house and two cars\"? Does he want you to have a job, or does he want you to be happy and unstressed (because right now, those two appear mutually exclusive)? Can he see himself marrying you in the not-too-distant future, even if that future isn't now? Or is he still waiting for some other sign?",
            "Agree 100% with what everyone else is saying and I want to add - please don't fall for the \"sunk cost fallacy\".\n\nOne of my best friends came out of an 8 year relationship this year. They met at 23. Right after the break up (he cheated on her so it was easy to walk away from), she had the whole \"I'm in my 30s and want kids, oh god what will I do\" -- let me tell you, it's only been a couple of months and she is THRIVING.\n\nEven though she's in lockdown in an apartment by herself, she's been going to therapy every week since the break-up (virtually for the last few sessions), she has an excellent support system in the form of friends and family.\n\n*\"When someone tells you who they are, believe them\"* \\-- he has told you several times he doesn't want to get married. Don't waste time on a relationship when you have different end-goals.",
            "\u201cBeing your best selves\u201d is a really good way to keep changing the parameters of what he requires in order to propose. He\u2019s being shitty. This is just a cop out way of avoiding what he doesn\u2019t want to commit too. Also, if he can\u2019t love you enough to propose to you at your worst, he doesn\u2019t deserve to have you at your best. The phrase \u201cfor better, for worse\u201d is there for a reason.

I wasn't sure if he was joking too much or if I had been misunderstanding him. He went and bought a ring that day, after we talked seriously about marriage.\n\nIt was an honest moment that resulted in him proposing a few days later. He said he was waiting to save enough money for a ring and more, but we are in a time in our lives where finances will be tight for a while (graduate school). I said please get me something with your birthstone, I just want it to come from you.\n\nHe made it happen, because he wanted to get married. I am not perfect, and least of all right now. But we share common goals to better ourselves and help each other achieve them, and cheat together (on our diet by eating pizza) along the way. We love sharing our lives together. There is a part of me that wants everything to line up perfectly, but on the other hand, life is messy sometimes. He is wonderfully loving and uplifting and I'm insanely lucky to have found him. I love our engagement.\n\n\n\nI have been married before, and there was no proposal. It's a long story but the short of it is, some guys can feel a lot of pressure to propose. We had a bad and short-lived marriage, and it made me realize how important the *proposal* was to me.\n\n\n\nI don't know if this is what you want to hear, but 8 year might be telling you.. he's still not ready to get married",

There is no definitive point where you are \"your best self.\" That's just my personal opinion but I feel like this is relevant to your situation. Also, another personal opinion but I think 8 years is too long to not be married. Think about it this way, you have already spent a significant amount of time with him. Life is a gift that shouldn't be wasted on people who don't deserve it. I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it because I don't know him but definitely consider whether or not you want to continue wasting time with someone who doesn't even know if he wants to spend the rest of his life with you. On the other hand, I would try to figure out the root of his reasoning for not getting married yet. Maybe he does a legit reason that he hasn't told you yet or maybe it stems from his childhood. The takeaway from this is do what you feel is going to benefit you in the long run. It may mean you end up being sad for a while but you'll find new happiness with someone who shares your desire for spending their life with you or perhaps he'll come to the conclusion that he does want to marry you and it'll all work out. So just try to look at this from both sides and see which situation is going to better you in the end. I hope that helps a little. :)",

It's the engagement and promise I needed. The wedding could wait til we were more economically stable, even if that takes a year or two.\n\nWhat his issue was. Wasn't that he didn't want to marry me. But as a man he feels a lot of pressure to provide for US and make sure we are stable and safe. A wedding and marriage just seemed stupid to him when we BOTH know we can't afford it now. What he didn't realise is that people can take over a year to plan a wedding. In his head, a proposal meant we'd get married maybe 2 months later while broke.\n\nAfter talking, we have figured it out. He'll propose soon, while I get enough time to plan out the wedding.\n\nSo my main advice is:\nIs your man generally a good man in other aspects? Few mistakes but still a good man?\n\nIf so, then talk to him. Tell him it's the commitment, that you're scared about your biological clock.

We got married a year after that. There is an argument for growing together. Marriage isnt about being your best self at the time. It's about committing to your partner that you are going to continue to grow together and get better with them. Maybe you can talk thru that.

On one hand it's scary going into something so serious if you're unsure which it sounds he is, not doubting his love for you but it's a big commitment so understandable. I jumped into a marriage with someone I wasn't sure about and she was awful, she drank too much, cheated, didn't look after herself and I stopped fancying her. That whole situation ruined my next relationship as I put those issues into the next girl who I was deeply in love with but feared she would go down a similar route and destroyed my relationship. It's hard. \n\nBut then on your side I also understand, how long does it take? When are you both ever really going to be ready? If it's love then the rest shouldn't matter and I've had a similar conversation with someone I loved who told me the same things and it all felt like excuses. \n\nMy advice is be patient but firm, don't wait around for someone who's never going to commit but also don't push him away in the process because he may have his own issues he needs to deal with too. At the end of the day I think calm communication is key and not over text or a phone call, sit him down on a good day when things are good and ask if you can talk. \n\nSorry that's all I've got.

And he cane up with some other excuse. And I dumped him again. And tried to stay friends. And ended up dating again. And a year of couples counseling got him to admit he was afraid of marriage for reasons having nothing to do with me. I dumped him and went no contact. Another year of individual counseling helped him sort out his issues. And we ended up running into each other and dating again. And when I proposed the third time, he said yes. We got married 13 years after we started dating. \n\nHaving him tell me he didn\u2019t want to marry me and breaking up, being told I wasn\u2019t good enough, was the worst thing I have ever gone through. It hurt in my chest like a heart attack. And I stretched out my suffering for YEARS. It ruined my self esteem. It took years of therapy to get back to a good place. And yes, we both worked on ourselves and had a happy ending. We have an amazing solid marriage. But honestly that was super good luck on my part, because he refused counseling for five years. And 90% of the time that doesn\u2019t change. I\u2019m the exception. Not the rule. And I was only the exception after I dumped him and went no contact and decided I was worth more.",

Marriage is a co tract where you agree to stay with the other person even when they are their \"worst self\". Its kind of like having children. If you are waiting until you are ready, you will never have children.",
            "Take this with a pinch of salt, as you should take anything you read. But to me, if he's willing to say 'we should wait until we're our best selves' why is he even in a relationship?\n\nLife is full of struggle and suffering. A relationship isn't just there for two perfect people to get together and do nothing. Your partner should be there to support you through the hardships. Marriage is a commitment - it is saying that only if you die will you stop helping your significant other, and stop being there for them.\n\nThe way I see it, relationships can help refine people. Occasional bits of conflict can chisel away parts of people that are nasty, unhelpful or destructive. And who really is their best self? Who can honestly say they have no insecurity and no inner struggle?\n\nSo personally I think he needs to reevaluate what he thinks a relationship is for. I'm sure he has helped you in the years to become who you are. And maybe he's just a little scared of the commitment. But truly, if he is waiting until you are both 'ready' to marry, you will never marry him. So you should be very Frank with your discussions with him in future and tell him what you want. Maybe he has other reasons for not wanting marriage. Maybe his own parents had a bad relationship.",

Look, after 8 years y\u2019all are probably living together and after that long you probably have money figured out, too (whether you\u2019re money is yours and his is his, y\u2019all combine your money, whatever it may be). At this point, getting married isn\u2019t going to change much but it\u2019s what you want and you should have a say in when it happens.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d give a timeline. I\u2019d do something like engaged in a year, married in 2 or maybe you\u2019re out. It seems harsh, but marriage is a 2 person decision and it sounds likes making it about his position. \u201cBeing your best self\u201d is a never ending goal, why is he so against it otherwise?",

We have talked about it, and a few years ago we had the same talk about financial stability, and wanting to afford a wedding. We are on the same page, and are in no rush as honestly not much would change except having a ring. \nThere is nothing wrong with moving slow, but you both have to want that and it sounds like you are ready to take the next step and he isnt. You need to have a serious conversation about the idea of marriage and ask yourselves if you really see yourself with each other, getting married, having a future etc. Dont let him treat it as a joke, or brush you off. If this is something that is important to you, he should care enough to talk to you about it and do so honestly. \n\nNow, something else you should talk about are his comments about your weight. That is not okay, and you do not have to put up with that. Honestly that was more of a red flag to me that being together so long and not being married. I get if he\u2019s genuinely trying to motivate you and help you better yourself thats one thing, but he needs to do it in a way that is not hurtful to you and your feelings. Please talk with him and tell him how you feel!",

            "It's hard to comment on your timeline - each to their own. My parents got married after 13 years together and there was no proposal.\n\nEqually, when I met my partner he didn't \"believe\" in marriage. Mainly because of the broken home he came from and relationships he saw around him. I knew I wanted to get married, at some point, but given my parents example, I never felt the pressure for it to be rushed and joked that when we're 50, we'd be lying in bed one morning and he'd say \"shall we do it?\" (\"it\" being marriage).\n\nHe surprised me 2 years ago by proposing (after 5 years together). But I somewhat get your partner's \"best self\" thing, because me and my partner, while completely dedicated to each other, have far bigger priorities and aspirations (both professionally and personally) than marriage. Haven't planned/looked at anything!\n\nFriends who got engaged after us, haven't been together as long as us, have already walked down the aisle. But we genuinely feel so secure in our relationship that we will get married when personally and professionally, we are in a \"better\" place.\n\nWhy he proposed? Fuck knows! Ha. I joke. But what it did mark for him was an acknowledgement in himself that he is not the same person he was when he came into this relationship, and for us, that was enough.\n\nIf it's not \"enough\" for you to be in your relationship and you need the marriage, I would first be compelled to ask you why? Because the foundations of your relationship are so much more important than that (unless you are religious of course, which if that is the case I understand).\n\nMy parents, after waiting 13 years to get married and still happily, and I mean that, they are the genuinely happiest most in love couple you will ever meet.\n\nWhile my friend who has been with her partner for 9 years, and he's just proposed (during a rough patch), well, I'm honestly not sure how far they'll make it based on their foundations.\n\nI get the \"better self\" thing because we are jointly going through that. \n\nP.s.... Maybe, it's because he wants to be able to propose with the ring of your dreams and be able to go straight into planning a wedding (of which the average cost is something like 20k plus!) rather than waiting another eight years before actually getting married. Hence wanting to be in a better place financially also to be able to say to you, here, you can have whatever wedding you want - no expense spared. And I say that because I said to my partner about eloping or a small registry office wedding and he says he knows me, yeah of course I will be happy with that, but he also knows I am a money worrier and wouldn't have the wedding I actually want so wants to be in a better place professionally/financially so money isn't a question.",

Also, why do you want to marry someone who makes you feel bad about yourself?\n\nHe keeps moving the goalposts. He doesn't want to marry you. The question is, why do you want to marry someone who doesn't want to marry you or needs to be nagged into doing so? Or who keeps telling you that you need to be \"better\" to earn a proposal? It should be a carrot on a stick. Don't you want more for yourself? \n\nStop wasting time on this dude if your goal is marriage. He's made himself clear. You need to listen.",

            "I haven't read all 421 replies but, I've read enough to get a flavor of them.\n\nCamp 1 He's never going to marry you so break up with him.\n\nCamp 2 Give him some more time and lose those awful 20 pounds.\n\nCamp 3 8 years isn't really that long of a time, so hang in there girl.\n\nNow let me ask you to join my camp, camp 4. First stop reacting in any way about his comments about your weight gain, 20 pounds is nothing. React as if his comments are interesting observations, do not let yourself be manipulated.\n\nThe next part that needs to be tackled is your career or job, I don't know which you have because they are completely different things. In your case it sounds like in both of your jobs you have been unhappy. Your boyfriend has stated that he'll want to get married after the both of you are your best selves, well lets give him what he wants and see if you're good enough to marry at that point.\n\nGo out somewhere today or in the next week where you can be alone and really think, think about what would be your dream job, and think about weather it is attainable or not. If not then move on to another idea. Come up with at least 20 jobs, you really want to figure out where you would be happiest. Then eliminate out of your list of 20 for whatever reason until you are down to three or four that you would love, look over the commonality in these jobs and select one to go for.By the way fellow reddit posters and OP I am not Bull Shitting about this crap. There are so many people who spend their lives in a career or job they absolutely hate and they spend their lives in misery. So why do this, you are making yourself the best you can be, which is what your boyfriend stated he wanted.\n\nIn his career he is financially secure so he should have no problem what so ever with financially supporting you when you tell him you're going back to school and getting a Phd in lesbian dance theory (just kidding) or whatever you decide to do. You might even want to go into business for yourself or something that doesn't need a degree. Contrary to popular belief it is not a mans world, it is in fact it's a woman world (if you're American). There are grants, loans, and a shitload of other advantages waiting for women (in America) to take advantage of if you women would open your eyes and look around.\n\nSo Camp 4 is stick around until you have a career you like or love, lose the 20 lbs or not, be happiest with yourself. Then stay or leave. Who knows you may decide after you've gotten your life where you want it that HE is not right person for you to marry.\n\nIt shouldn't take more than 2 years to decide if the person you are with is worth marring or not. Historically people have gotten married straight out of high school at 18 or in their very early 20's. The median age for first marriages today is 29 for men and 27 for women.",

If you do want to be a mom, you might run out of time waiting around for him, particularly if you want more than one or two children.

It seems to me that there are a lot of issues both of you need to work through. \n\nIs this the right time to do that? Personally, I think you might both be under abnormal amounts of stress visible or not, because of the current situation we're all in. It might negatively affect any conversation about the future you might have. Then again, only you know both of your lives best. \n\nI thnk you should also think of what this does to your partner. You come online because you're upset, and get a bunch of strangers who tell you your partner's being crap and then you act on it, would that be fair to your partner? What if it were the other way round?",
            "Don\u2019t listen to any of your single girlfriends. They haters and want you away from him. experienced Married people for many years are best.",
            "My husband didn\u2019t believe in marriage when I met him in December 2015. I spent a good amount of time deciding whether or not I was okay with that. Ultimately I decided that I was, but he proposed in October 2016 and we got married in July 2017. \n\nIf marriage is important to you, and you\u2019ve expressed that to your boyfriend but he doesn\u2019t feel the same, I think after 8 years it\u2019s obvious it isn\u2019t what he wants- be it marriage in general (which is totally fine) or just married to you (which is also fine). You deserve someone who has the same wants as you! And so does he.",
            "He should love you for who you are. You shouldn't have to change in any way.\n\nEveryone needs self improvement in their lives, but it sounds like he isn't happy with you the way you are now - he either thinks you aren't marriage material, or you don't meet his expectations (stable income) as prerequisites to marriage, or he simply doesn't want to get married (it has connotations of feeling like you're a responsible mature adult, which is scary). There's obviously something going on here with his thinking. There's a remote chance he's trying to surprise you, but given lockdown it's not worth it now.\n\nI also want to ask, why does he have to be the one to propose? Seems sexist, and seems like the happiness of your relationship is dependent on him alone.\n\nI would ask a few things to help clear this up:\n- Does he ever want to get married? What are his concerns? Is it money, commitment, attention, time and effort, fear of tax benefits, fear that it puts a marker in your life and there's no going back from being seen as a 'grown up? \n- Where does he see himself in 10 years? Are you in his picture? \n- What are your reasons for getting married? (E.g. celebration, bringing friends together, starting a new chapter in your lives). It's very possible he's never fully understood the reasoning behind marriage and doesn't see it the way you do. To some people it's not important, or it's a fairly trivial thing, to others it's a huge gamble and makes you part of some larger system that you might not feel prepared for or want to be part of, to some it's seen as narcissistic.\n\nI'm actually surprised myself, the average age for first marriage varies between 19-35 depending on location. In the UK, the age of marriage seems to be rising and is now between 35-41. I'm 30 and male, but marriage still seems off the cards to me.  Marriages have also gone down a lot since 1972, especially religious ones.",
            "I genuinely think he's stringing you along. He's complacent and doesn't want to commit. He'll just stay with you until something better comes along or you get fed up and finally break up with him.\n\nBeen there.\n\nEdit: you guys have been dating since you were very young. Is it possible that he doesn't once you commit because he feel like he hasn't sown enough wild oats?"

        "selftext": "Thanks for everyone who came and tossed in their 2 cents. It was wonderful to hear from other people without having to worry if they would repeat my chatter to the other party involved. \n\n[First post link in case you dropped your phone in a toilet.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3v240s/we_husband_32m_me_26f_have_been_told_by_his/)\n\nSo... I'm not 100% sure where I should start I am about 3 drinks in just to calm myself. For one I did show my husband the post after we talked. I brought up T-Day2015 and asked him if he wanted some more input than I normally give on his family drama. He said yes, I pointed out the favoritism of his brother over him in almost anything. I made a list showing times when it had happened were they and he were fully in the wrong just to prove the point.\n\nWe went over the texts from his brother, SIL, Mother, Father, Aunt and Cousin. Just to recap names...\n\n* Brother - Timmy\n* SIL- Candy\n* Mother - Rhonda\n* Father - Keith\n* Aunt - Kira\n* Cousin - Ben\n* Husband - Tod ( this is shorter than husband, I'm lazy.)\n\nSo,  the day I posted after we went over the texts which started after we missed their call and went up until we sent the email... all just... spiteful shit about how we waste our money, time, and life volunteering and don't spend enough time with their children/cousins/cousins children/family anymore. It started out telling Tod he was being a 'candy ass bitch who is whipped' by his 'cold harpy child hatin wife'. And just degraded from there. Tod only sent back a few saying he'd email him about it and asking him to not talk about me.\n\nSo we sent the email here is basically what we sent I semi edited it. Tod send it as if it was just from him, we almost added in his parents but decided we'd just forward it to them if it really got out of hand, NP Timmy did it for him!\n\n> Tim, I'm sending you an email so we can talk about what happened on Thanksgiving. I think this would be better for us both since when we are heated we say things rashly. You didn't give me much time to really think about it so here it goes.\n\n> I don't understand why you volunteered us to buy gifts. We are happy to buy gifts for your children as we have every year. Is there something going on? Is someone having financial problems? While we would gladly help anyone who asked (As we have before, you should recall Cathy and Kiki 2 years ago. you helped too!) being set up in front of young children was rude. Not to mention you telling us we aren't allowed at Christmas now. \n\n> The texts and angry voicemails were also uncalled for.\n\n> Please take some time and get back to me. I hope we can work this out as our family is very important to us. Tod\n\n\nYes well that went over about as well as water on a grease fire.\n\nFor one Timmy forwarded the email to Rhonda and Keith, Kira, and Ben. That was rude but we were going to do the same thing either way. Ben sent us a email letting us know what Timmy did and said he was sorry he wasn't there to jump in but would try and talk to Timmy. Timmy and Ben are actually really close so it was nice to see he thought Timmy was being unreasonable as well since they are normally very close/like minded. \n\nI'm not going to put his email here I'm just going to highlight what he said and then tell you what Keith and Rhonda said in their email/visit.\n\n* I am a cold, child hating, harpy, and I sleep around.\n* I'm an atheist, or a muslim... or something, he never really picked.\n* I am dragging Tod from the church and his family.\n* We don't spend any time at all with the family anymore. \n* We never spend any time with our niblings.\n* We are wasting our life/time/money volunteering with animals.\n* Helping/wanting to help refugees was un american and this is my fault since I am a first generation american and don't understand what it means to be one/deserve to live here. \n* I'm rude and never talk to them unless it's about animal rescue/animal rights\n\n\nYeah so... um. At this point we're kinda laughing and kinda crying and kinda shocked. We spent the rest of the day cleaning up our house and talking about what we wanted to do/reply back. We hadn't checked our email and we'd stuck our phones on vibrate and were just trying to enjoy our day off together, they're pretty rare sadly. So suprise! His parents drove all the way out to talk to us.\n\nI say talk, but it was more like being talked at. They asked me to leave so they could talk to Tod about 'his actions/rude email'. Tod said no, said I was his family and his wife and we were handling this together. They then tried to convince us we had said fuck in front of the family. We didn't. That we had mentioned buying gifts for everyone before. That we didn't love Jesus anymore since we hadn't been going to church. And some of what Timmy has sent in the email too. When his Father started to insult me and then in turn my Father, Tod was done. He stood up and said \"Thank you for coming to visit us in our home for the first time but we have errands to run and you need to leave now.\". They refused, he told them they had to go, now or he'd have to call the police. They left. He cried, I  cried, our cats knocked over their cups. \n\nWe ended up calling my Dad and telling him everything as well as showing him both emails. He told us they have before talked shit about me/us to him. \"You should be able to fix your child still we're still working on ours.\" was something he told us had been said. We decided we aren't going to their Christmas either way. I told Tod I can't go back there again, nor can I look at any of them the same again. I knew they'd always not liked me as much as some of the other daughter in laws but I didn't know it was to that extent. They have always been nice and polite to my face. Invited and included me in all events. No one had ever said anything to Tod either.\n\nAs it stands I'm waiting for my Dad and brother to get into town and then we're going to sit down and decide what we would like to do. Tod said he just wants it to be small and doesn't mind where Christmas happens and said he felt closer to my Dad and brother anyway.\n\nWe told Ben what happened and shipped his gift to him. I haven't decided yet what I will do with the niblings gifts but I already donated all of the adult gifts. \n\nTLDR I suck, Tod is pussy whipped bitch, we are blind, fuck it. All hail the red squiggle for making this spelling look less stupid. \n\nEdit TLDR: Sent email, got email back. Email sent around. Parents showed up, BS , all my fault, we aren't going to xmas or talking to them until after holidays are over. \n\nI'd also like to add I am not of another ethnicity. My father is German and moved to the US when he was 20 to marry my Mother. So I'm a pasty white chick but I guess since my Dad isn't american dats bad. ",

            "OP, I do hope you read this, and maybe showing it to your husband would be a good idea as well.\n\nSometimes, cutting off all ties with toxic family members is what's best. My family no longer speaks to anyone on my father's side (his mother and siblings). Basically, here's what happened; Grandpa died from cancer, and he asked my dad (Grandpa's youngest child) on his deathbed to take care of Grandma financially. He had a bank account that was to be used to help out Grandma if she can't pay her bills.\n\nSo every month, my dad would go over to Grandma's trailer and calculate her bills for her, and tell her how much. She would *always* give less than what he told her, so he kept going into the bank account to take out whatever she owed to pay off her bill. He kept doing this until one day Grandma suddenly said \"The bills were never this expensive. I don't think you're telling me the truth\". Basically, my dad's sister (my god mother) had gotten it into Grandma's head that my dad was taking Grandpa's money to pay for his own shit (he had just recently bought a motorcycle with his bonus from work, as a GM of a car dealership... so sure he needed to steal money from dead Grandpa.../s) and my dad was highly insulted at the idea that he would betray his own father, when this was the only thing he had ever asked of my dad his entire life. So, my dad essentially said \"fuck you\" and left his brother to do the bills.\n\nHis brother contacted us a month later saying that my dad was right, he was doing the bills correctly, and Grandma wasn't paying enough. Neither Grandma nor my god mother apologized to my dad.\n\nThe rest of his siblings cut contact when my parents decided to stop talking to Grandma.\n\nBut we're not miserable. Cutting them off was for the better; what kind of grandmother would be so stubborn that she would refuse to apologize and now can't see her grandkids anymore?\n\nPoint of my story is, just because they're your family doesn't mean they're your *family*. Being blood related doesn't make them good people, doesn't make them love and respect you, and it certainly doesn't make this type of behavior acceptable. You guys are 100% justified in cutting them off, and I doubt your husband will be happy if he kept attempting to fix relations with them. It may be hard but it's better for everyone in the long run, especially if you decide to have children; you don't want them to be sucked into this mess.\n\nAlso, I really admire that you volunteer your life/time/money on animals. Not enough people do.",
            "Omg, you lost me at \"un-american\". \n\nSide note: there are some 330ish million Americans, to ascribe the idea that all of those people will agree that something is good American vs bad American is preposterous. \n\nIts usually used by lesser educated people that want a quick way to filter through a life of information inputs into something easy to understand...

That they are so angry that you're helping people who are in terrible situations and instead want you to spend your time and money on them and their offspring is just monumentally hypocritical and just the opposite of what Jesus would do. Ask them to think about whether Jesus would turn away desperate people fleeing persecution in favour of providing material gifts for people who already have enough of what they need.

I did do a little revenge and the day of Christmas brought empty gifts with the names of families and kids we donated to and explained that if I was banned from the family so be it. I am, and they didn't want their precious children to learn about kids who are poor. On a side note, we did get thanks from almost all of the families, and we are still currently gathering money to buy things for them and a lot more this year.\n\nLike I said, I do hope this ends positively and as someone who childfree you have my support because reading everything they said makes me feel very ill.",

Your husband needs to bring it up in front of everyone. Keep your cool, let him say what needs to be said. Then when the discussion gets heated say whats on your mind with no holding back.
