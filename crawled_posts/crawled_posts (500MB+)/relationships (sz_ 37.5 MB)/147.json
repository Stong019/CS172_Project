            "I think the way he reacted is telling. Asking you to buy him a car is WAY overboard. If it were me, I probably wouldn't break up with him just for that. I would start with a conversation about money/finances. I would explain that you are looking to keep things separate and he is in no way entitled to your money. Think about if you truly want a future with someone like him. \n\nIt sucks that it becomes a problem in relationships. How did he find out about it? ",
            "Start talking about pre-nups. Watch him freak out. Then you have your answer",
            "How did he find out about you having money? Is he seriously asking you for a luxury car?! \nI don't want to automatically say dump him, but the fact that you suggest dumping him makes me wonder how healthy and happy you are in the relationship and how things were going before he found out about your money. You've been together for 3 years. Were you being treated well? Were you happy? Did he hold down a job consistently? Did he give you gifts of equal value? Had he changed his behavior since finding our about the money? \n\nIf he's really broke maybe he's just immature and excited about seeing more possibilities for fun in the future, but than in itself is kinda worrisome, because it seems he might be into spending your money little more than you are. I'd recommend making sure you protect your funds from him if you do decide to continue.",

            ">Is this reason enough to break up with him?\n\nYou never, ever need a \"good reason\" to break up with someone. \"I don't think I want to be in a relationship with you\" is enough. They don't need to be bad people, they just need to be not-right for you, and you get to decide what right is.\n\nThat said, absolutely this is a good reason! You're not an ATM! And the \"Our money\" thing is a big red flag. It's not \"Our money,\" it's your money, and if he starts thinking that things belong to you just because you're dating him, that's a big problem.",
            "One of my favorite sayings- money doesn't change people, it shows you who they really are.",
            "Wow, I've been with my husband for eight years and even I felt a little guilty when we started talking about getting me a new (used) car this year since he's the income earner. I can't even imagine asking a boyfriend/girlfriend of three years for a new luxury car. Then you add the house and \"Christmas present vacation\" on top of that? He sounds incredibly greedy. \n\nI do have a couple of questions though:\n\nDid you have any shared expenses before this? When you go out for meals or dates do you split things, trade off paying, or does one of you regularly pay? \n\nHave you two ever had a discussion about finances before? I guess in my opinion that seems like something that should have come up at least once in the past three years, especially if you've talked about marriage and buying a house together. \n\nHow does he spend his own money? Is he constantly buying things for himself? Does he ever reciprocate the large gift giving that you do for him? (Like the PS4 and computer.) \n\nI think from the way you've described things the majority of the fault lies in him. He honestly sounds like he's either very bad with money or just trying to take advantage of you. That said I feel like finances are something you HAVE to be honest and communicate about. Like I said, I can't imagine going three years in a relationship with someone and never having even a casual \"So how much do you make?\" conversation. ",

If you were living together and he said \"Hey can you cover more of the shared expenses since it won't put you out and can alleviate some of my financial burden?\", that I could understand. But he's literally acting like you owe him money just because you are in a relationship with him. \n\ntl;dr  He pretty much sees you as his free ATM. ",
            "As someone with NO spare money with a spouse who also has no money, so you know the shit I ask him to buy me? I asked for a burrito. He said he would buy me a burrito. And ice cream. I ask him for little things, and I'm saving up for his birthday. \n\nRegardless of how much money YOU have, how much you choose to give is up to you, not the other person. Sure, he can ask, and it's normal (like my burrito). But at the point where he wants you to fund his LIFESTYLE that's where you have to shut it down, and explain to him that you work hard for money, and splurging on something as unnecessary as a luxury car or a European trip makes you feel uncomfortable and used. \n\nTruthfully, I wouldn't consider marrying him anymore, either, as it looks like he might have only proposed to get at your money. Also, peruse the marriage laws where you and he live, and see if, in case of divorce, he gets half of your money. Sadly to say, that might be his ultimate goal here. ",
            "He is way over stepping his boundries. Advice to buy your own place where its yours and he contributes by paying off utilities is an idea and as for the free LUXURY car and trip he must be smoking something.

            "Wow, that's some next level gumption to ask for a luxury car.  Asking for something THAT big reeks of entitlement.  And \"our\" money?  Not until he puts a ring on it (which I don't think you should let him).",

He doesn't see you as you anymore, you're like one of those cartoon dollars uncle Scrooge sees. \n\nThe problem isn't that he's talking about the money. The problem is that he's doing it with such an entitlement and disrespect of boundaries. He hasn't committed to you, yet feels as if you owe him. He didn't ask you what countries you would go for, what car you'd love and what he's going to contribute to the house. He's not an equal partner and he's demanding more from you than he offers. \n\nHe's going to be pissed if you dump him and accuse you of being shallow. Don't fall for that bs. You're his mealticket.",
            "Jesus everyone is so quick to scream \"END IT!\" on here. Have you talked to him about this? Set boundaries? If you haven't, try telling him something along the lines of \"This is my money. If I WANT to spend it on things for you or us, I will. If you ask me to spend thousands on you, I will not. Do not ask me to buy things for you or I will leave. You are an adult. If you want a luxury car, start saving.\"\n\nDo NOT tell him that it will be \"our\" money once you get married unless you want him to marry you for your money. In fact, tell him that even after marriage, it will be yours. Consider a prenup. Even if you plan to merge finances after marriage, don't tell him that.\n\nOf course, if you've already tried many times to talk to him, he's been selfish in other ways, or you generally want to leave him- go ahead! If you want to end things you are free to do so.",
            "I'm gonna go against the grain here and say that you should just put your foot down on what you will and will not buy for him.\n\nAll this place ever recommends is breakup, this is pretty solveable.",
            "How long have you been dating him, and how was it that he came to know about the money? Let him know that you are not comfortable with combining finances with him, and if he still insists on gifts of material value and making you uncomfortable, then you should break up with him.",
            "Yep, end it.\n\nFor reference, I have family in Europe (Croatia too, as it happens), and I've offered to spot my boyfriend so he could go with me. He was extremely uncomfortable with the idea (and I went solo). Together longer than you guys.",
            "I have more money than my boyfriend and I have no problem *loaning* him money for things like his latest car-he was promised a larger severance bonus and didn't want to take out a 3k loan to pay off the last bit.  We've also been together three years and have lived together for the past year.  You aren't married, you're just dating.  You've already given him hundreds of dollars worth of gifts, isn't that enough for him?\n\nYour name implies you inherited the money, meaning you're not rich due to a constant income.  Look at how expensive his tastes have gotten since he found out.  If he keeps living like that, how long do you think it'll last?  a $30,000-$70,000 car, a $100,000-$600,000 house (depending on area), how much more will you have?  What will he want once he has the car and the house?  People don't suddenly decide that enough is enough.",
            "Marry someone with a mindset like that and you'll soon find yourself without money (unless you're richer than he is foolish), I would imagine.",
            "It seems before he found out he still saw you as a long term companion, so this could just be a poor reaction to finding out about your money.\n\nDo not get the house together as it's a long term investment and you're currently unsure of your relationship. Tell him you want to wait on that and don't feel comfortable yet. Tell him you aren't going to buy him a luxury car or trip through Europe. It's very possible these were things on his mind before that he's wanted, but only now found out are within the realm of possibility. Breaking up with somebody just because they like nice things is kind of ridiculous.\n\nThat's why you need to set the boundary that it's your money, not \"our\" money. Communication is the most important thing here, and if he's unreceptive or pushing for your money, then it's a bad sign. You need to find out if he values your money more than you. Set a distance between your money and him. Make sure he knows that your relationship will stay the same and that you are a fiscally responsible person who won't throw your money around for him. Money doesn't have to be a big deal if he knows your boundaries; that is what prenups are for.\n\n**tl;dr do not break up, talk to him**",

Going forward, it's always going to be about the money and you'll always be looking at his motives, questioning if he wants you or the money. At this point, it wouldn't matter if you discussed it with him; based on what he's shown you about himself already, you know his focus is now on the money. \n\nDump his ass.",
            ">Is this reason enough to break up with him?\n\n\nYah. He seems to be only concerned with your bank account now.\n\n\nOf course this could just be his weird way of dealing with the fact that his SO has a lot more money than he does and he isn't serious at all.\n\n\n (your title and post makes me feel strongly that there's a massive difference between the two of you in terms of personal finances)",
            "It doesn't show a lot of character for him to act that way. I'd leave if I were you. \"Our money\" is a huge red flag. ",
            "Don't end it based on what he is asking for.  Simply say no and decide whether or not to stay with him based on his reaction.  Christ, if he is serious then he is a pile of shit.  On the other hand he could be making these comments through a new insecurity developed by knowing you have so much more money than him.  Let him know it bothers you.  He either stops asking or throws a fit.  Then you will know what to do with the relationship.  ",
            "Talk to him about it. Say that this is making you uncomfortable, and that you are not planning on breaking into your funds any time soon. Be upfront that it's one of those things where, were you to get married, you'd need a pre-nup as this money is meant to be for you and the next generation of your family. (I assume!)\n\nIf he can handle all that, I don't see why you need to break up as seemingly every Redditor says on every post. You make the decision about whether you like him, and whether he's mature enough to get past this.\n\nAnd if he handles it well, in a month or two you could suggest doing that Europe trip. Life experiences are worth it, but first he has to prove he's there for *you*, not your bank balance.",

I saw you said in another comment that another relationship ended because they went a little nuts after finding out. Maybe he is a little over excited and as you have spent money on him before for presents he feels this isn't much different if it's \"a drop in the bucket\" of your wealth.\n\nBefore making your decision maybe you should let him know how you feel. He has spent 3 years with you, I assume you're in love, so you know he was with you for you. My partner and I refer to each others money as \"our\" money but that was kind of a decision we made together.",
            "Ew. No. Just no.\n\nPeople you want to stay with in keep around find out about your money, kinda shrug, go \"ok, cool\" and go back to life as you know it.\n\nPeople you don't want to stay in your life say \"Gimme gimme gimme!\"\n\nFwiw, my Mother's cousin married someone obscenely wealthy. He never let on how much money they had the entire time they were 'courting'. He only finally told her right before he asked her to marry him, because he wanted her to know everything about him before she said \"Yes\". They are still happily married some 50 years later. :) And some of the nicest people you'd ever want to meet. If you met them socially, you'd have no idea the extent of their wealth. Your BF doesn't strike me as that type.",

            "Everyone seems to think this guy is horrible so i'll play devil's advocate.  Firstly, is it actually YOUR money, or is it FAMILY money?  Did you earn it yourself? Secondly, maybe he never had the opportunity to see life with the options granted from having money-but he's been in a relationship with you for a few years and maybe now he sees those options and wants to indulge.  It doesn't seem like you live frugally if you're buying him a PS4 and gaming PC and flying him to Italy, so why should he assume money is a big deal when he realizes you have it?  Thirdly, if he is in a relationship with you, and HAS BEEN FOR A FEW YEARS ALREADY he's probably been considering a future with you, and knowing that your future together will be financially sound has got to do wonders for the speculative mind... freeing it up for stupid requests.  You just sound insecure with the source of your money more than he sounds like a gold-digger, and you really sound like your looking for faults in a guy that loves you regardless, maybe you have commitment issues? Do you think you deserve better?  Then who is the entitled one?  Okay, now that I've played Devil's Advocate, just communicate your feelings.",
            "Ewwwww this is so tacky. I dated a guy who came from way more money than I did and I never expected him to buy me things unless he wanted to go to some fancy restaurant and I didn't (not to mention his salary was 30% more than mine atleast). I also had a modest but still upper middle class upbringing and I try not to live outside my means even though I easily could if that makes sense. I highly doubt this will change and while I don't think you have to date someone of a similar background, I think being with someone who places similar value or not on money and material possessions is so important. \n\nThis is my long winded way of saying he's a gold digger and you can find someone not after your/your family money.

You know he hasn't been with you for the money all along so maybe things have a chance. He needs to know that you won't tolerate this sugar mama shit.

If YOU decide you want to spend it on a vacation or a car, then you can, but that's not his choice.  \n\nIf he can't handle that at the very least, then I would break up with him.   Tell him exactly why too, maybe he can learn from his mistake. \n\nThe only reason I'm not jumping on the bandwagon with the rest of the responders is because it sounds like you haven't talked to him yet and you might be able to get through to him.  A lot of people get a little weird when they find out the person they're closest too has a stack of money.  That might just be what it is.  He might feel like he's hit the lottery.

You're not ready to move in together although you've been together 3 years... maybe you should break up, not just because he wants this funding from you, but because you don't see a future together.",

He's spent a significant percentage of the relationship with you for, well, you.  And I think he's still trying to do that. \n\nThe reason I say that is because if he comes from a different socioeconomic class compared to you - he may just have the stereotypical view of \"well-to-do people buy anything and everything for the people they love\". \n\nJust have a good heart-to-heart conversation with him about why he thinks it's okay and how it makes you feel. He knows (and probably loves) who you are as a person, and if that's the case, he values your opinion on things. \n\nLike, yeah, it's possible that he's only with you for the money now, but the only way to know is to talk to him about it.

Who will be paying the taxes on his new sports car and this imaginary house? Give him firm boundaries and judge from there. This is probably a dream of his he never thought possible and is exited at the idea. Set him straight. He may be embarrassed or sad or confused but give him a little bit of private time to set out his emotions and then make your decision. I'd like to lay on heavy that he may be seriously misunderstanding how much money you and your family has. You don't have your families money per sey. Everything gets taxed, especially businesses.

He has never had to deal with that before and there is a learning curve.

He wants you to fund his extravagant lifestyle. \n\nYour boyfriend has shown his true colors. Unfortunately he now sees you as an ATM. Since you say that you were happy with him before, it is reasonable to have a conversation with him about how his demands make you feel and why they're unreasonable.

He hid this from her because previous girlfriends got really weird about his money.  Kind of like your boyfriend.

But don't feel like you owe him half of your money. \n\nThe one thing you should be very careful of though is that if you move in with him you make sure you sign some sort of agreement stating that the money you earn is yours and not both of yours.

I think that money often comes in between people and ruins relationships that have potential to be great. If you're so rich you could afford to buy other people luxury cars you're bound to end up in situations such as this one many times down the line, and if your default method of dealing with it is breaking up you will have a hard time finding a lasting relationship.\n\nI'm not saying you should stay together with this guy if you don't want to (which, it seems, you obviously don't, or you wouldn't have made a post ending with \"Is this reason enough to break up with him?\") but when you find yourself in the same place sometime later, how about you just try ignoring these \"red flags\" as part of human nature?

            "I obviously have the minority opinion but he has gone out with you for 3 years before knowing you had any money and was already planning on asking you to marry him. He obviously loves you very much.\n\nHe might just be one of those people who feels that you should enjoy life to the fullest because you don't know when it might end. So having a nice car and going on a trip , when you still both have good jobs (neither thing will put much of a dent in your finances) He might just be thinking hey we can enjoy this now, then settle down and get married, get a house, have kids etc\n\nWhy would you go out with a guy for three years when you don't seem to trust him at all?",

Money clearly isn't the deciding factor in his decision to go out with you and so his reaction to you having money, strange and frustrating as it is, shouldn't be an automatic knee jerk - break up with him. At least give him a shot.\n\nI'd give good old fashioned communication a shot before I'd dump him. If you always break up at the first communication hurdle you'll always end up breaking up after a few years and never learn much from any relationship.\n\nUnless of course you kind of wanted to break up with him anyway and this is sort of a last straw. . . but then why were you introducing him to your family?",
            "Not sure how much money it is but perhaps it can be put into a trust. Doesn't mean you wouldnt have access to it but may help it seem less like free money. Id be more concerned about his fiscal perspective. You sound like a saver and perhaps a bit more frugal. He sounds like it wants to live for today. Those two perspectives will be difficult to combine without problems. He will view you are the one with all the power since you control the money. But if you give in, you will see him as controlling and greedy. I don't see a good way our unless you talk to him and tell him this money was left for your future- not for vacations and toys. Let him know you don't like his suggestions that he gets stuff because you have money. The two of you can save together for stuff from your jobs and the savings remains for security. And by all means don't do anything unless married. And don't get married until you are both on the same page about money. ",
            "Listen to \"Gold Digger\" and this is what you have here, but from a guy pressuring a girl, not the other way around. \n\nHe obviously wants the money to marry you (out of wealth), bleed you dry, cheat, etc\n\nYou may have not noticed it before, but this is how all your boyfriend's (er, fiancee's) negative traits come to light. \n\nDitch him. \"Our\" money? No. Just no. If you do decide to marry him, make sure you have some written (detailed) prenup and separate money accounts. They aren't bulletproof, but it's a way to prevent him from taking everything. ",

I'm sure you have no problem spending money on good investments (a house is generally a good money investment, but keep it in your name) and perhaps a trip to Europe together is a good relationship investment. But financially buying a luxury car is a bad move (it's a depreciating asset), if he drives it, you get nothing emotionally out of it, it doesn't help you be closer as a couple, so it's a bad financial, emotional, and relationship investment. But in the end, if you don't want to do it you don't have it, even on things they might actually make financial sense. I couldn't blame a guy for asking but if you explain no, you won't play sugar momma and he doesn't drop it, then I think you could dump him. But the guy dated you and loved you before he knew you had money right, so he's in a relationship with you because he loves you for you, not your money. Which I say earns him a right for your forgiveness and understanding this one time. ",

            "Honestly it doesn't matter whether you can afford these things or not.  It's rather presumptuous and selfish of him to make those kind of plans for your money.  If I were you I'd definitely be turned off from him and reconsider the relationship. ",

            "I think if you choose to try to continue this relationship - couples counseling is in order.\n\nIf he refuses it's really a no-brainer as to what to do. If he goes and quits early or refuses to work on the issues - again - no brainer.\n\nThe counseling though may help you both to communicate better and easier and also to resolve the money issue between you.\n\nWhat you need to decide now is if - in fact - you want to continue this as it is.\n\nWhat does your gut say?",

Is there a reason he hasn't purchased himself a luxury car or financed his own European trip? Does he seem to be more attentive with you since finding out about your money? In retrospect, does any of this matter in terms of your relationship? In other words, have you both been happy? 3 years is a long time and if you have a healthy relationship it's less to worry about. That being said, if you were to give him something less frivolous, he should graciously receive your gift(s) if he doesn't have dollar signs in his eyes. If he complains that it's not what he asked for, red flag. Couples move in together all the time. If you feel this is what you want, he should still have his fair share of the bills. Living together will be a time of revelations which is normal and what you need. Your relationship shouldn't change with the news of your money. Just be observational, he should love you not your bank account. Best of luck! ",

If your relationship is balanced and you feel reciprocated based on his requests then analyze that but at the end of the day you are yourself and no one is able to dictate the direction of your life. Influence occurs but understanding your position in what you're willing to provide is ultimately up to you. Being selfish has a stigma but it allows you to draw the line on being more of a giver than your partner contributes. A relationship is not 50/50 but should have 100% from both parties. If that's not the case don't overextended yourself. ",

I feel like he just got excited hearing all those digits and could just be letting his mouth run. Talk to him. Calmly let him know that it is your money, for YOU to do as you wish/need. That his thoughts, (trip together, house) are sweet and would be great, seem inappropriate right now. Remind him that you're not saying no to his happiness, but yes to a secure future. \n\nGood luck.

You probably should have given him a heads up before making him 'discover' it on your European trip. Just a, \"Hey, my family is wealthy. However, it is not my wealth, and in the past boyfriends have been gotten weird after finding out about it. I don't want money to define who I am as a person, and I hope this won't change anything between us.\"\n\n\n\nDuring your discussion with this current boyfriend make it very clear that it isn't \"our\" money. In fact, if you get married, there will be a prenup. Did he mention marriage before he found out about the money? If so, would probably be a good thing to start discussing in terms of long term plans and budgets.\n\n\nAs for the European trip, if you think it is a fun idea. You can offer to let that be your Christmas gift as well and you can both contribute equally (equal-ish) financially to the trip.\n\n\n\nI wouldn't go so far as to say he is a gold digger. He might just have - stars in his eyes - it's kind of like that question of \"what would you do with a million dollars?\" He might also be relieved that *you* aren't the gold digger, and now he's just vocalizing things he's been planning on doing anyway with his own money.",
            "That's not very polite of him.\n\nIf it makes him weird about it and a bit overprivileged about it all, it's your prerogative.\n\nI'd say do it, if he won't comprehend how ridiculous his requests are. This is real life. Earn that stuff.",

You and he obviously have different attitudes about money and his attitude is a huge red flag, but you can teach him how to be better with money.

            "People saying, \"don't break up but have a conversation\" are steering you the wrong way. When someone shows you their true colors like this, they're giving you the gift of foreshadowing. Don't ignore it. The person you thought you loved doesn't exist anymore. Look up stories of lottery winners whose family/friends find out about it. Some change and become greedy, entitled, and cruel. It sucks, but you don't need to allow people like that in your life because they convinced you before they cared about you. You know now he cares about himself and what you can do for him.

Why pay rent while you could own and have the value appreciate?  Of course the house goes in your name only.  A car? no. vacation? if you want to go together perhaps.  Again, I'd dump him.

I know, I know, you are 28... but it's really important to protect yourself and your assets. You need a living trust. Everything that you own, your house, investments... goes into that trust. This way, you will never be placed into the situation where you will need to get a prenup. Nor will you lose any money connected to your inheritance in the event of a divorce. You can live in that house, and maintenance to that house will be paid from trust funds. \n\nYou need to do this whether you marry him or not and you need to do it before. That way, assets that are acquired within whatever marriage you have, will remain yours unless you specifically separate it from the trust and turn it into a community asset. \n\n>Several times he's referred to my money as our money and using our money to buy him the luxury car he's dreamt of having, he wants us to move out of separate apartments and get a house together and has said instead of getting him a small Christmas gift that I should fund a trip for him to see Europe.\n\nHonestly, money makes people nuts. This is *your* inheritance legally. Not both of yours. Inheritance is exempted from community property. For the time being, you will be the sole beneficiary of the trust, eventually when you have a husband that isn't begging for a BMW and kids, you can decide where the money goes if something should happen to you. \n\nThe fact that my inheritance has been in a trust has saved my life. I lost nothing in my divorce, except for what I gave him in the agreement. And the luxury car, which he got, depreciates. \n\n>instead of getting him a small Christmas gift that I should fund a trip for him to see Europe.\n\nHow lovely. I would like one too!\n\nHe wants to blow the money and hey... he didn't earn it so he doesn't care about it.

I think discuss with him about it, and gauge his reaction, if he is immediately understanding and falls back off continue the relationship cautiously, if he is defensive and angry, then break up. ",
            "Is this the only real issue with him?  Have you told him you don't feel comfortable with him making decisions for your money?\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would lay down the law with my significant other and ensure they knew they have no right to demand such things.  Their response would be the determining factor.  \n\nYou need to clearly define your boundaries and if he tests them, drop him.  If he respects them and recognizes he's allowed your money to change his view of the relationship and works towards respecting you, it may work out.",
            "You don't need to end it, but his reaction is messed up. It also depends a lot on his situation. Does he work? If he's lazy and is relying on you, then absolutely this is a problem. If he works hard and just doesn't earn as much, that's a different story. In a relationship, you should SUPPORT each other, but not USE each other. It sounds like he's trying to use you. \n\nI'd be wary moving forward, to be honest. And I would absolutely not buy him any of the things he has asked for. If he breaks it off as a result, you know his motive. ",
            "Yes it is.  It's YOUR MONEY.  I'd sit him down for one more conversation and tell him that because you have that money doesn't mean that you need to spend it the way he wants.  If he wants a house, split for it, if he wants his dream car, he should be paying for it.  Any conversation that involves your money moving forward will make you feel uncomfortable and he has no say in it whatsoever.  if he disagrees then yes, break it off.",
            "He obviously thinks you need him more than he does (emotionally, physically) and as such he's using you.\n\nWork on this to restore a balance to the relationship. What makes him feel empowered enough to make these demands without thinking about the risk that he might lose you as a result (b/c this is how this whole thing seems to be). \n\nSometimes even our dogs take us for granted. This is behavioural so some correction is needed. \n\n",
            "Everyone is saying breakup, as are you.  If this keeps happening, you're fishing with the wrong bait, and thus catching the wrong fish.  Start looking for someone who has built their own money, or at least has some and knows how to protect it, etc.  It sounds like your bf is acting like he won the lottery, rather than, well, how do you expect people to act when their gf of three years turns out to be loaded?",
            "This is something that you two need to have a long and lengthy discussion about. I'm in a similar boat and I have enough money where I honestly don't need to want for anything but she doesn't have a lot. Anyways, long story short we ended up having a long conversation and set some defined boundaries. You need to do that with him. Say it's my money, not a single cent is yours. Tell him that you are willing to get him presents but you won't fund him. \n\nIf he fails to understand boundaries, kick him to the curb but until then try and work it out.",

            "He's being ridiculous and selfish. It's your money, not his.  Those conversations should not be happening unless you were married.\n\nIf you indulge him now he'll bleed you dry and you'll go broke. Consider the Europe trip as a honeymoon or anniversary trip- that is IF you thought he was the guy you wanted to marry before he started acting this way. ",

Tell him that it feels now as if he's only interested in your money and that you'd like him to back off about these demands/wishes. If he's not willing to, then yes, this should be a dealbraker for you.\n\nIn the future, seeing as this has been an issue, maybe you should be upfront about it. When things start getting serious, sit your boyfriend down and preempt this situation from occurring by letting him know you and your family have money but that it's been an issue in the past and while you're more than willing to spend it on yourself and your boyfriend, it's still your money and yours to do with as you please. He shouldn't expect to have any say as to how you spend your money.",

            "I would have a stern talk with him first and tell him you aren't comfortable with buying him a car and committing to a house. See how he takes it. If he pouts and doesn't take it well, lose him. But then again if he does take it well and proposes to you, you might always wonder if he just wants your money lol so I guess just lose him.",
            "That is beyond pathetic. If you do end up getting married you will be financially liable for his poor decisions. I don't know what your personal relationship is like, but please don't trap yourself like that.",

            "As someone who doesn't have much money dating a person who has a decent chunk of money, this guy is doing it wrong. I am super frugal and constantly encourage my boyfriend to save for the future. I would rather have that money later when we may need it or for retirement. I don't need stupid gifts and trips now. I would let him know how you're feeling, but his behavior is definitely a red flag.",
            "Tell him that you don't have any liquidity, and that any gift you make he has to pay taxes on.\n\nAlso, mention that **if** you get married you have to get a prenup, because your investors/clients/accountant/lawyer demand one to make sure your ability to deliver on your business remains impaired.\n\nWatch the reaction.\n\nAnd finally, to comment on whether people can be so shallow as to pursue a person solely for the money, oh yes, and it is far worse than you can imagine. I have seen a 40 year old woman pursue an 80 year old man so she can remain with his pension when he dies. People would do crazy insane disgusting things for money, things you wouldn't imagine.",
            "I wouldn't say necessarily end it, but definitely make sure there's a talk in order....why throw something potentially good out without trying to get to the bottom of it? Sadly money does make people change and act differently. But if you let him know where you stand and that it shouldn't change anything, it should show more of who and how he is... I've had a partner I didn't know how money until later and we kept acting like she didn't have it unless she brought it up or something important came up, but she was still the one to mention it. \nTL;DR - money shouldn't change people and I'd try talking first to see why he's this way before tossing it to the side :) \nBest of luck OP, and hopefully it all goes well!",
            "He's seeing you as his sugarmama. Seriously, a PS4 isn't that difficult to afford. I earn $750 a month, pay for my studies and bills and managed to buy one by saving a few months. He's not your kid, he's supposed to take care of his own finances.",

I wouldn't expect extravagant things, but I've never made more that $25000/year. The thought of millionaire status is so far from where I am right now or have ever been that I might think that buying cars and traveling internationally is what rich couples do. Talk to him.\n\nHe's been with you for 3 years without knowing. I'm pretty sure he still loves you for you. ",
            "I honestly think it is reason enough to break up with him. \n\nRelationships are founded on equality, and any inequalities need to be made up by something else, whether tangible, intangible, present or clearly defined future (someone is going to school, then gets great job so that other person goes to school, etc.). \n\nThis is coming from a woman who's been broke as fuck (BaF) her entire adult life. I have always been total shit at managing money, and haven't believed that I could get a good enough job to be even middle class. Finally lower middle class, with a trajectory for more. I haven't even gotten myself basic toiletries on my boyfriend's dime, rather going without, just so I wouldn't be beholden to him and stress him out. I have tried to \"fast\" before when BaF (read: starve), but he wouldn't let me do that. \n\nNow we're both doing a bit better, and his career could possibly lead to him getting large chunks of money at once (large for us is 50K). I do not assume that this would change A BIT of how I live, including making it easier for me to buy contacts. Even though we've lived together for 3 years, I do not presume to A PENNY of his money, present or future. What he chooses to give if he gets any money is another matter. But your money should be YOUR MONEY, and he should not make a peep about it. \n\nSo yes, break up with him. \n\nEDIT to clarify that it's not about the money so much as it is about the presumption to the money, which to me is gross.",
            "Sounds like he thinks your money is his money. Tell him how it is or leave him. If he is this entitled now, guess what he will be like in the future.",
            "I would talk to him about it and honestly think if the relationship is equal in terms of paying. I've been with guys where I pay most of the time and ended up breaking up with them because I felt like they ewre mooching off me. ",
            "I hate how my advice seems to go against the flow.  Keep in mind he was your boyfriend before he found out that you had money.  If you're looking for a husband, consider if he would stay with you even if you somehow lost all your money. \n\nIt's very likely that he just has large dreams and shared those with you.  He might think that he would do the same for you if he was rich.  He probably has less financial restraint due to lack of managing wealth.  But whatever the case, he's not a gold digger if he got with you before he knew you had money. ",
            "Based on the fact that you said he does fairly well for himself on you own I'm hesitant to jump on board the \"dump him he's a gold digger\" train. \n\nCan you go into detail about how he brings these trip ideas and whatnot up? Do they come off kind of like a demand, or is his mind in a place where he's just thinking \" we can afford this now \"?\n\nIt matters because if he just views finances in a different way than you do it would be worth just sitting down and talking with him about your boundaries with money. It's something that should happen soon if you were considering marriage anyway.\n\nIf he hasn't been a shithead in any other aspect of your relationship I think it's worth talking to him about what's bothering you now before you cut and run.",
            "It's one thing if he found out you were rich and asked if you could put a little more into the shared bills, and something completely different to demand luxury cars and trips. Your his gf, not his cash cow. Have a discussion with him and tell him that you are concerned with how his attitude has changed towards you recently. Tell him that, yes, your parents have money, but that doesn't mean you have the funds, nor the desire, to be his sugar mama. If he has a problem with that, then you have your answer. ",
            "You don't have to necessarily break up with him, but it is a strange turn of events. Your money is your money and you're free to do what you want with it.\n\nI suggest you be upfront with him, literally tell him word for word what you've said here in this post. You need to at least have that conversation before getting more serious anyways.\n\nBut, ultimately your gut is telling you something and it might be right, so in my opinion for the sake of closure put it all on the table and go with your gut feeling after that.\n\n",
            "I agree with everyone else's comments. The only thing I want to say though is that it's not uncommon for dating couples to move in together before deciding to get married. I understand cultural differences between your country and mine might be vastly so in this case, but I don't think America is all that different from Canada when it comes to things like this.\n\nA lot of people have the mindset of, \"I need to see what living with this person is like before I can finally decide to marry them\" and lots of people move in together much earlier than 3 years of being together.\n\nThat being said, I can understand why he might ask you to be the major provider when it comes to buying a house, but everything else is just simply out of line. \"Buy me a new car\" is not the same as \"buy us a new house\", at least I don't think so. Houses may be more expensive and it's still wildly inappropriate for him to ask you for such a thing, but when it turns from \"spend your money on us\" into \"spend your money on me\" that means he's becoming selfish and entitled to something that belongs to you.",

            "The fact that you see this as a reason to break up with him should be enough of a justification to break up with him.\n\nHe opened the Pandora's box of making demands (no matter how nicely worded), and essentially trying to usurp control of part of your assets.  \n\nIt's pretty disturbing he would assume he has any right over your/your family's wealth, and it's not an assumption you can take back.\n\n",

Your post makes it unclear if he knows your precise income/savings or if he's just come to the ballpark knowledge that you/your family are in a high income tier.  I'm also not clear on whether or not these are fantasies he's bandying about (which would still be inappropriate but could be fixed) or if he's actively pressuring you and ignoring your obvious discomfort.  If it's the latter, then yes break up with him!\n\nBut if these are just ideas/wishes that he's throwing out there, maybe you guys just need to have a serious discussion.   It sounds like family money is a really sensitive point for you - it's burned a past relationship and this whole thing is clearly making you very uncomfortable.  Tell him that!  There's a way of reading his wishes as general ideas of cool things for both of you to experience, but you need to tell him that his excitement is making you feel used.  \n\nUnless you marry someone as rich as you, there's a really good chance that you'll have to deal with being someone that's excited by a lot of money.  But this guy has committed to you for three years before finding this out - I say you give him the benefit of the doubt and tell him what you need. \n\n",
            "I have a trust fund. Enough for a down payment on a house but not the whole house. My husband of 8 years, boyfriend of 8 years before that, has never once asked for money from it. Did we use it as a down payment for our house? No, we saved up for that. He needs a new car, his commute is an hour each way and his car is old and uncomfortable. Are we using my trust? No, we are buying him a new car when mine is paid off next summer. He considers it my money, which it is.\n\nWe do, however, consider how it might be useful to us *as a family*. We have a 5 year old son, and the trust would put a nice dent in his college tuition. It could help us in retirement. In fact, it *has* been helping us with income - I am disabled, and my state is so backlogged with disability approval requests that it took *3 fucking years* to get approved (and I have a very obvious need - brain damage from MS). We used some of the trust as income while we waited for approval (which was granted earlier this year). While he has no demands of my trust fund, it would be selfish of me to hoard it and leave us in financial hardship for three years. He offered to get a second job instead of using the money from the trust, but I shot that down and he didn't push. That's as close as he's come to asking for my money.\n\n**tl;dr** - I am in your shoes, and in 16 years, my then-boyfriend, now-husband has never made a demand or request of my money.

Aside from my wife now, she was my other serious relationship. We had dated in college and well afterwards. \n\nHer family was very rich. She lived in a rich part of LA, neighbors are celebrities sort of place. She always shopped and had really nice things. She had a nice car especially for college etc.. But she wasnt a spoiled brat. She appreciated everything she had and never thought she was better than anyone else. In fact she kept it pretty low key, her nice things were not flashy. She wouldnt throw big parties or pay for the bill at restaurants when we went out with friends. She never talked about how rich she was. Alot of people in college didnt know how rich she was. She was that kind of person. \n\nI never let her pay for anything significant for me. She would pay for dinner sometimes and i would do the same. Splitting bills while dating was just kind of tacky. But for example if we went snowboarding i would pay for my lift ticket. My gear was all paid for by myself. She never bought me anything big, i wouldnt let her. I paid for my plane tickets. I got the hotel rooms. It was a great relationship.  I paid my own way. I had my own car which was a toyota compared to her mercedes. I never thought any of her money was my own.i never thought i had to keep up with her lifestyle and definitely didnt feel like i was entitled to any of it. We didnt start getting each other anything big until i started making money of my own. \n\nYou need to decide whats important to you at this point. If these are his only quirks and he treats you like a queen otherwise then just set him straight. If you wished he wasnt like this and you think he likes your money more than he likes you or sees you as his meal ticket then you will need to make some decisions. Good luck you will figure it out.

How can you explain that you missed such an incompatible view of money for 3 whole years? \n\nIf you want to hang on this, at the very least you should tell him that if you continue on, you intend to draw up a prenup where your previous wealth will be untouchable by him, because you already had other plans for it.

        "selftext": "I hope this doesn't get too long. \n\nFor a little bit of background:\n\nMy sister and I have the same dad but different moms (my dad left her mom for my mom. I know. It's kinda shitty.) Neither of my parents have more than a grade 9 education,  and both make just slightly above minimum wage. My sister (like every other woman in my family) got pregnant when she was 16, and moved out on social assistance. I wanted to break the cycle, and although I tot pregnant at 20, I went to university, married the father of my child and am now working towards my Masters. I have a lot of pride in the fact that I broke a 3 generation teen pregnancy, high school drop out cycle.\n\nMy sister now has five kids ranging in age from 10-3. Normally, I couldn't care less how many kids someone has because it's none of my business, but this whole situation is impacting everyone negatively. \n\nMy sister and her husband do not work. They have to get Christmas hampers, borrow money, and live on social assistance. They also don't take care of their house. It's literally like an episode of hoarders in there. There's cat and dog poop all over the floors, mouldy food everywhere, dirty diapers etc. My nephew was once so hungry I caught him eating a bowl of mouldy cheerios once when I visited(I'm tearing up just writing that). We have all gone there multiple times to try and help them clean up, and have gotten 2-3 dumpsters full of garbage out each time. \n\nEvery time my husband and I take the kids, we have to take them out and buy them clothes for while they're staying with us. The clothes they come in don't fit, reek like cat pee and are always inappropriate for the situation. For example, every summer we take one of them camping (they never get to do anything with out all their siblings and it's something they each look forward to each year).  It was a 6 day camping trip and all that was in my nieces bag were a pair of her older brothers jogging pants (he's 10, she's 5!) And a weird ripped fleece dress that was 3 sizes too small. This is a common occurrence. \n\nOn Sunday we had our sons birthday party and all the nieces and nephews were invited. 3 of them don't have any winter gear and were wearing Jean jackets and running shoes in negative 10 degree weather. The oldest had dog poop on his pants, and the youngest had gum stuck in her hair. The entire time all my sister would talk about was how they can't wait to have their sixth child and they're already trying.\n\nI'm honestly shocked. They have no means to take care of the five of they have. I get that it's not really my business, but the fact is, children's services are already very involved. If things get any worse, they will lose all the kids and the general family consensus seems to be that I'll take them in when that happens. I love those kids, but my husband and I have worked extremely hard to be able to give our two children good lives. I don't want to sacrifice their happiness and well being because of someone else's mistakes. \n\nOn top of all this, my sister has been diagnosed with some sort of personality disorder and her psychologist straight up told her she should stop having babies because it's negatively affecting her. \n\nI'm so saddened by this. I want to help them but I'm honestly out of ideas and patience. \n\nSo Reddit, should I just bite the bullet and take the kids in when they get removed? Child services has given them one last chance to fix the situation, and the two of them haven't done anything about it. Or should I let them go into the foster system? I just need outside perspective. \nEdit: I also wanted to ask if there is any way I can help my sister besides the cleaning etc?

            "> the general family consensus seems to be that I'll take them in when that happens\n\nYou need to nip that in the bud. The longer your family is allowed to believe this, the worse it will get when you say \"no\".",
            "You're not under an obligation to take them in.\n\nNormally my advice would be about family, and love, and its not the kid's fault, and keeping everyone together is worth a little discomfort and adjustment.  But this isn't one or two kids.\n\nThis is potentially *six*.\n\nWhich would bring your total number of children to *eight*.\n\nThat's not a small adjustment.  That's a major life shift.  That's a new house, new vehicles, second or third jobs to afford everything shift.  I know of very few people who could afford - literally afford - to suddenly expand their family from four to ten.\n\nI think, in this case, letting the foster system take the children in is in everyone's best interests.  You should be able to keep track of them, find out which homes they're going to, keep in touch, make sure they're all doing okay, etc.  You don't have to abandon them just because you can't house them.\n\nre:  helping your sister:  you're screwed until you can get her to understand her situation and how bad things are.  You can clean and shop for them until you're exhausted and broke and if she doesn't pull her head out of her ass and start actually parenting then you might as well be raising them yourselves.\n\nYou could try to get her to see a therapist or a social worker and get advice, but you can't actually force her to do anything.  I'd say let her hit rock bottom and reach out for help but she's there now and seems to be enjoying it.  I think it may be best for the kids to be away from her and that house for a while.  While I think you can help your sister improve her life, I don't think you can save her family.",
            "OP, I'm not sure you taking all 6 children would be healthy or wise for your family or for your nieces/nephews. I don't need to go into the reasons why, as everyone seems to have already covered that, but it is probably safe to say that you can rule that out as an option. \n\nHowever, you can still be there in ways that matter. If the kids are split up (which they probably will be) you can provide a hub for them to all come together and keep in contact with each other. You can provide support, guidance and the knowledge that they have a solid (sane!) family member who cares about them. Talk with CPS when the time comes and let them know how much you're willing to do and stay in regular contact with the kids. \n\nI know this all seems sort of obvious but there seem to be a lot of 'this isn't your problem' type messages on this thread and whilst I very much doubt you feel that way because of the amount you do already; I just wanted to press the general point that they deserve someone to care. I have family members and work with children who came through the care system and I dread to think what would have happened to those kids if they didn't have some form of loving family behind them.\n\nIt sounds like what you're doing for the kids already is amazing - and most importantly, you care about them. Keep on that track and you'll be doing right by them.    ",
            "It's not clear where you live, but taking in six kids is no joke. As much as CPS will want to keep siblings together and with family, in many jurisdictions there would be restrictions on this many kids (six plus your two) being placed in one home. ",
            "No.\n\nYour parents and siblings do not get to put this on you. Everyone who thinks those kids should stay in the family needs to take in ONE kid to their own house. You'll find out really quickly what they really think is best for those kids.\n\nFor what it's worth, I don't think those kids are well served staying in the family. If I were you, I would take ZERO. (I also would call child and family services. Those kids need a stable home, NOW.)",

            "Idk what your financial situation is etc., but even if you had  a little extra cash, when you have the kids over for say a sleep over or something, even just a place like walmart you can find small kid clothes at really cheap prices and get the kids some stuff (if doable) or likewise do it for when the kids have birthdays, christmas etc.  \n\n\"I love those kids, but my husband and I have worked extremely hard to be able to give our two children good lives. I don't want to sacrifice their happiness and well being because of someone else's mistakes.\"\n\nThat is quite spot on. If it was a kid or two and you can handle thatd be a differing story- but 5 or 6, that could also mean needing a bigger house, etc, etc. \n\nReally, the rest of your family I would just ignore- you went above and beyond to work hard to where you got in life. Just because it sounds like they are all of that same mindset- does not mean you should feel burdened or feel responsible to tackle even more than what you already have. \n\nWhen it comes to your sister- you can only do so much- it is up to her to go and get help and be actively trying to get better. As you said they are both not working, so if you help with the cleaning, what exactly is it that she is really going to be doing? A plan should be put into place- need to be on top of her to follow through with it (sounds like that is going to be the hardest part). ",

You will probably be in contention for the best (actually, already ARE!! considering things you've done for them), aunt on the planet!  It is not worth turning your entire life upside down, and I'd hazard - with some experience/wisdom under their belt, those kids would NOT want that either.  Hell, it would likely ruin the one \"safe zone\" that you provide!  \n\nAlso... just an aside, you didn't mention how your husband feels about any of this.  At all.  ",
            "Taking in six additional would have a dramatic impact on your family's lifestyle and on the quantity of time you can spend on your relationship with your husband, children, career, and relaxation.\n\nYou don't have to martyr yourself to clean up, yet again, your sister's poor choices.  Let the children go to state care.  You can stay in contact with them, visit, and offer support, without taking on full-time caregiving responsibilities.\n\nBTW, another thing to consider about taking on the children:  Your family may see that as an easy way for them (your adult family members) to effortlessly stay a part of the kids' lives, flitting in for fun visits but without any responsibility.  There's no reason Family can't stay a part of the kids' lives if they are in foster care... It just means your family would have to make effort.  Don't be the one who takes on the responsibility because everyone else is lazy.",
            "Five or perhaps six kids is not \"biting the bullet\", that's like biting a nuclear weapon. You will try, out of guilt, and the ensuing chaos will break you , your husband, and your two kids. The kids will go to foster care anyway.\n\nThe best solution, honestly, is if you can take even one or two, and the others go to other family members. I hate splitting up siblings, but five kids would get divided up in foster care too. At least this way it'd be family placement with no official termination of parental rights.\n\nYou need to have a family pow wow where you CLEARLY EXPLAIN you cannot take all five kids and that they MUST also accommodate the kids or they are going to foster care. It may end up being a combination of foster care, family placement, and your sister keeping whatever new kid until she fails again. ",
            "You'd be enabling her shitty behavior by taking her kids for her. You'd do all the hard parenting work and I'm sure she would still get to see them if you had them.\n\nShe needs to feel the severity of her shitty actions. Usually courts give shitty parents a way to get back on track and get their kids back too, but she needs to earn that.\n\nYOU should be calling CPS on her and speed up the process. Your nibbling is eating mold for Christ's sake.",
            "Unless you are making wellllll above 6 figures, you will not be able to comfortably afford taking care of a total 7 - 8 children that are still so young. Do not do this. Start telling your family now that rationally, if CPS comes in, you would not be able to take them but would love to stay involved in their lives as the aunt. \n\nThe IMMEDIATE thing to focus on though is to dissuade your sister, using all means of persuasion possible short of physical torture, to NOT HAVE THAT 6TH KID! Is there a way to plead to her husband? Can you get her on reliable birth control? Convince him to use birth control? Etc. A 6th kid born in that mess is just heartbreaking. The kids don't stand much of a chance to succeed in life, statistically speaking ..",
            "This should be posted in the side bar: \n\n**Do not light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm**\n\nYou need to put yourself and your family first. You are in charge of two small humans and their entire lives. You need to put them, and yourself, first. ",
            "Your sister is the epitome of selfishness.  I rarely get super upset or angry,  but people like her and her husband disgust me.  Not only are they ok with neglecting their own children,  they're ok with passing on that responsibility to others and just  keep creating more!  I know a kid whose parents were just like this. The stories she's told me are enough to make anyone cry. You think moldy cereal is bad?  Just wait until you catch them eating dog food because their parents prioritize the pets (that they clearly shouldn't have) over them. True story. :'( \n\nNo,  do not take the kids in.  It sounds heartless, but this is why: she will not stop having more once these are taken away.  \n\nWhat happened to the little neighbor girl?  She and her five siblings were split up.  She and her sister, as the youngest of the children,  were lucky enough to be adopted by their paternal grandfather and his second wife.  The rest of the kids were put into foster care.  Did the parents ever try to get them back?  No.  It was easier to make more, and hey,  more government benefits for their lazy asses! They continued to squander their assistance on booze and drugs.  The new kids were neglected.  More taken away.  \n\nPlease do not enable her by keeping the kids with you.  The problem won't stop there.  You are under no obligation to lower your or your family's standard of living.  Foster care is far preferable to the squalor they're living in now. Even if you did,  what would you do when they have more kids and those are also taken away?  No,  you are not the problem here.  Your family shouldn't be trying to put this burden on you.  \n\nRather,  you ALL need to knock some sense into your sister.  Tell her how awful she's being.  Tell her to get sterilized if she at all cares about any of these children.  \n\nCertainly do not make it easier for her to assuage her conscience.  She's deliberately neglecting her children. She should feel that burden, not you.  ",
            "I was a foster parent for years, and my husband and I raised five children after adopting three children out of CPS.  It was a tough row to hoe, and our family struggled.  One of our daughters was diagnosed with psychological and behavioral disorders, largely as a result of the neglect she suffered in her birth home.  There were times I felt so guilty for causing outright suffering for our other children due to her acting out and for having to ignore some of our other kids' needs due to the time and attention she required.  \n\nSo I guess I have three points for you to consider.  \n\nFirst, a large family is a **lot** of work, even if all of the kids are happy and healthy.  There is a lot of juggling for both parents to make sure each child gets time and attention.  The addition of each child makes the workload *exponentially* harder for the parents.  And my husband and I had to work so hard to make our marriage a priority in our lives.  \n\nThe workload is so much higher if any of the family members has special needs.  Given the home life your nieces and nephews have suffered, I would prepare for at least some of them to have behavioral and psychological issues that would require a lot of special time and attention.  Special meetings and educational plans at school, therapist visits, constant contact with social services, delinquency and police issues, etc.  \n\nWhile it is certainly rewarding to help a child in need, be aware that your own child will have a *very* different home life than the one you've created for him now.  (Although, my children all agree that they are different, *and better*, adults for the home life we had.)  You need to have careful discussions with CPS as to any diagnoses or issues they are aware of before you agree to anything.  Also, I think you need to consider your own child's needs as equally valid and important as your niblings'.  \n\nThe second point I want to make is regarding the foster care system.  It is *completely* overwhelmed.  A large family of children is incredibly difficult to place.  Not only does your family expect you to take these kids, but you will be the first contact on the CPS's list in looking for placement.  You are correct to be considering your answer now, rather than rushing a decision because a social worker is on the phone telling you the kids have nowhere else to go.  Also, because of how difficult it is to place some children, some social workers will minimize problems and exaggerate available services to people sitting on the fence regarding placement.  Make sure you review all available records and services before you agree to anything.  \n\nHowever, if you do not agree to take these children, you should be prepared to see this family broken up entirely, with siblings separated into different homes.  It is almost impossible to find a foster family able to take more than one or two children at a time.  While your nieces and nephews are entitled to sibling visitation, we both know a hour long visit once every month or two is a very different dynamic than living with one another.  So this loss will be added to the loss of their parents.  (I'm not telling you this to make you feel guilty.  I just want you to be prepared for what is coming your way, so you aren't blindsided.  Also, CPS may use this as a tool to get you to agree to take the kids.)\n\nFinally, you should remember that the purpose of foster care is NOT to find new, permanent families for the kids.  The stated purpose of nearly every placement is reunification of the birth parents and their children.  While the kids are in foster care, the parents are given court-ordered duties to reacquire their children.  These can include finding and maintaining appropriate living quarters, therapy, parenting classes, etc.  In most cases, the parents are given 6 months to a year to complete these requirements.  Once children are returned to the parents, CPS usually monitors the family for a period of time to ensure no back-sliding.  So, if you do agree to take these kids, it would hopefully be temporary.  And if your sister's parental rights are terminated, you would have had some time and real experience with these kids before you make any permanent decisions.  \n\nI hope these points help your decision-making.  Remember, there is no shame if you decide not to act.  Fostering and adoption are certainly not for every family, and there is nothing wrong with knowing that it is not the job for your's.  A smart \"no\" is as equally valid as a caring \"yes\".  ",
            "I am so sorry to hear the the terrible situation the kids are in. Do you have the financial and emotional strength to take on 5 additional kids? What's the impact going to be on your kids? Your attention is now going to be divided amongst 7 kids. How is the family going to help with the chores of handling 7 kids?\n\nPlease think through this a lot, taking on 5 additional kids is not going to be easy. I don't know if the kids are going to have a better chance through foster care. ",
            "Your family wants you to take on this burden so that they won't feel obligated to do it.  They likely also think that your sister will still have unlimited access to them, through you.  The problem of your sister will be moved from their collective shoulders to yours.  \n\nI can just imagine sister wanting to be at your home all the time, in order to see her children, too - I can imagine her wanting to move in with you.  Your life will become all about caring for your sister and her children.  \n\nYour taking them in would just be enabling sister to continue the same loathsome behavior.  These poor little children need to be out of that situation as soon as possible.  Let sister deal with the courts, and the consequences of her behavior.  ",
            "It's not anywhere near the same magnitude, but we had a similar experience with my sister in law. \n\nShe was 17 when she had her first, and eventually had three children with a man in his early 40s. The relationship was mutually abusive and both were severe alcoholics. They lived 8 hours away though and other than refusing to enable and attempt to involve social services, there wasn't much we could do. \n\n\nOne day when my daughter was 3 we recieved a phone call from a social worker who explained that she'd gotten our number from SIL and asked if we would be willing to temporarily care for the kids. We didn't have much time to make a decision as they wanted to place them by the end of the day. So without knowing much at all, we agreed to take them at least until other arrangements could be made. \n\nThey showed up with nothing but the (filthy) clothes on their backs. My husband I didn't have a lot of money as I was a stay at home mom, but we managed to get them some clothes and toiletries. After a couple of days we found out that what had happened was SIL and her husband had gotten wasted and beat the crap out of each other. When the cops showed up they found the place just absolutely torn apart and the youngest (too young for school) hiding in a closet. He didn't speak for weeks. \n\nEvidently Social services gave SIL and BIL am ultimatum, they could attend rehab, stay away from each other, and they wouldn't order an official removal. If they refused, the kids would be officially placed in foster care. SIL agreed, BIL refused, so at that point he wasn't allowed to see the kids. \n\nThe deal was 28 days in rehab. They asked if we could keep them for that time and we kind of reluctantly agreed. We were in a similar spot as you, family expected us to step up as we were the most financially stable. \n\nWell 28 days came and went and SIL was out having the time of her life. She wasn't showing up for visits, she didn't even attempt to enroll in rehab and at this point we had no contact with social services, because we were not officially guardians and they hadn't been officially removed. Legally if she'd shown up to take the kids, we couldn't stop her. At this point it was the end of summer and we had to start thinking about enrolling them in school, which is difficult to do without legal guardianship. Not to mention, after 3 months it was beginning to deplete our savings, caring for 3 additional kids. We started calling social services daily and it seemed like things were going nowhere. \n\nSo social services starts pressuring SIL with threats of legal removal and she finally gets into rehab. The day she gets our, her husband picks her up, they pick up the kids (remember, we have no legal authority here) and evidently takes them to a party in a motel with 30 other drunks. We got a call at 3 am from the oldest (9 at the time);crying to come and get them because their parents were passed out and there were some scary people there. We drove around for 4 hours until we could find them (he didn't know the address) and we brought them home. \n\nAfter that social services decided to strip their rights and offered us legal guardianship through a program called kinship care, similar to foster care but for relatives. We discussed it and decided that it would be the best situation for them and we'd figure it out. \n\nSuddenly SS, the same people who left these  kids with us for 4 months with so much as a back round check or even a glance inside the house, subjected us to every type of criminal background snd child welfare checks, super invasive psychological testing, home inspections, letters of reference, letter from our employers and landlord, they even had us go through hours long questionairres about our childhoods, family, marriage and even sex life. It was bizarre. \n\nAll in all, that 28 days turned into almost 2 years, and in the end, the parents got the kids back by playing along for a few weeks and then going right back to what they were doing before. We raised these kids, loved them, educated them, played with them and read to them and then had to watch as they forced them to go back into this hell hole, begging and pleading to stay with us. \n\nIt turned our lives upside down, and it was one of the hardest things emotionally I've ever done. It was also extremely difficult for our daughter, who grew to love them like siblings. It ALSO ended up alienating those same family members who pressured us to take them, because we were very rigid about the rules and visitation schedule set by SS. Evidently they thought we'd be permanent babysitters while they went our partying and came and went as they pleased. \n\nI know this is long but there is SO much crap we dealt with with them (the parents) that I left out. \n\nMy point in telling this story is that, if I were faced with this situation again, I don't think I could do it and it is COMPLETELY unfair of your family to ask this of you, particularly when they likely don't even have the slightest idea of what it all entails. You have every right to decide that this isn't for you, and to be absolutely firm with your family about that. I feel for the kids, in your situation and mine, but that doesn't mean we are obligated to rescue everybody all the time.\n\nGood luck. ",
            "I'm not convinced that a) CPS will permit you to take them or that b) it would be in the children's best interests for you to do so. They would need a proper separation from their old living environment and living with a family member would not give them that. ",

Most foster homes can't accommodate 6 children and these are places deliberately set up to take in kids in care.. The social workers will completely understand that you guys can take in 6. If it is decided that the children need to be removed there will probably be a meeting where all those involved are able to say how they can help out going for ward, or can't. I am sure that you would be given an opportunity to explain that while you want to continue to be involved in their lives when they are in foster home(s) you just don't have space. ",

Will your family help you at all with these expenses if you take your sister's children in? I highly doubt it. Don't destroy the life you worked so hard to achieve for your sister's extremely irresponsible life. Your purpose in life is not to fix your sister's life and clean up after her. \n\nYou are potentially sacrificing the quality of life and resources that rightfully belong to your children if you take in your sister's children. Taking in 6 additional children is akin to getting a nasty divorce. It will completely change your life and family.\n\nI think the best option would be to let them go into the foster care system.

As a mother of 2 children I cannot fathom never bathing, feeding, clothing, or LOVING my children in the way that they deserve. This is not your burden to bear. You can't feasibly take care of your own, and five or six other kids. Please continue to turn her in to CPS. You know these kids deserve better and in this situation, they'd thrive in foster care. Your sister is a very sick individual, and I know you know this. Do whatever you can to convince her to get sterilized.",

You are under no obligation to do so, and they will be a huge financial, temporal, and emotional burden. These kids will need therapy, and likely more intensive mental health services on top of that (day treatment, in-home services, PCAs, school aides, etc). They will all need tons of time and attention. And having them all so close in age means they will cost a crapton of money. Honestly, I doubt any one family can take all of these kids - there's a very good chance they will be split up once they hit the foster care system. Don't try to be a hero, here - no one family, and no one person will be able to help these kids. They need an entire system taking care of them after the terrible lives they've lived so far.",
            "As a fost/adopt parent, I recommend you let the system take care of them but ask for visitations so you can make sure they are ok and well taken care of.

            "My aunt had her kids taken away when they were 7, 9, and 11. She had an older son but he was about 20 when they got taken away. When they finally were able to come back, one of them didn't want to. Almost 20 years later I can tell you that the one that got away from the whole family is the only one that is worth a shit. The rest are leeches to the system just like their mom. So in my opinion, let them get away from their parents.  Anywhere they end up will be better. ",
            "I'm going to agree with the other comments and say that you shouldn't take the kids in if you don't think you can handle them. Especially considering that these kids are from a troubled home and they'd be coming to you under stressful circumstances, it's not fair for people to expect you to handle that. I'm assuming you're not super wealthy, so the financial burden alone could prove to be too much. Going from 2 kids to 8, you'd probably have to get a new house if you're expecting to keep them for a long time. Obviously food and clothing will be expensive. Any activities or outings will be so much more expensive. Even if you get money from the government, that would likely be just a small portion of all the new costs. And then there's time. Even if one of you was a stay at home parent, it would be difficult to give enough time and attention to each kid. Yes, these kids are in a horrible situation, but taking them in could prove to be bad for you as well as your children. Not to mention that, how good of an environment will you be providing for the kids you take in?\n\nI don't know much about the foster care system, but I'm pretty sure you'd be allowed to keep in contact with them. You can still help them, and if you're concerned about their foster homes you can keep an eye out for that too.\n\nAnd I know you want to help your sister keep her kids, OP, but... You can't help people who don't want to get better. It sounds like your sister and her husband have no motivation to improve. Maybe you could help her get some psychological help, but I don't know what you could reasonably do beyond that.",
            "This absolutely breaks my heart. Those poor kids. Please call child services. Every day those kids spend in that hell hole is damaging them and she doesn't deserve another chance. Is foster care great? No, but it will kept them fed and clean. Your sister is not well and YOU cannot make her better; you have to let the idea that you can help her go. She is an adult who lets her children leave the house with dog feces on them. That is a person who's problems you can't solve.\n\nThere's absolutely no way anyone could take in 5 kids, and I would wager that they have some kind of developmental delays as a result of their upbringing. I love that you spend time with each kid individually. Shower them with love, and reaffirm that they are smart, worthy and great because it sounds like they don't get that home. You can help them by being a good role model, and continuing to spend time with them. If you take them in, their financial and emotional drain of 7 kids will drag you and your husband under, and then you won't be any position to help anyone.\n\nWho is making this 'general family consensus'? Your parents? If they are enabling your sister to continue living to recklessly, and putting the lives of her children in danger, you might want to rethink your relationship with them too.  ",
            "There's a saying I recently heard, \"You don't need to set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm\". When I was young, my mother's brother and wife lost their children to the foster care system (with darn good reason). My parents were in a better place than you to take them in, but they didn't. In the end, they were adopted in to a wonderful family. It was somewhat of an open adoption in that we were able to keep in touch with them, even though the parents didn't bother. \n\nIt was definitely in the kids' best interest. My cousins are doing very well, one of them is a software developer with a happy family of his own. It worked out.\n\nYou should not feel guilt or pressure to take these kids in. Even if you could afford to, it might not be in their best interests anyway. Child protective services needs to be involved, but realize that you should not feel bad or guilty if you can't be the one to take them if they are removed. ",
            "I can't imagine that taking all those kids in would not seriously negatively impact your own life and the lives of your children. There is no way that you can take care of so many children and give them all the time and love and attention they need (especially while doing a masters, but even without that). Never mind the financial cost of taking in so many kids you didn't plan for.\n\nI think that although it will upset you to say \"no, I cannot take these children in\" because you love them, you need to think about your immediate family (you, your husband, your kids) and the way those 5/6 kids would affect them. I can't see any way that you would all be able to live together without your relationships in your immediate family suffering greatly.\n\nYou didn't make her bad choices. Don't clean up after her. \n\nYou definitely need to tell your extended family pretty immediately that you won't be taking them in, it isn't possible. Don't bother explaining why in much detail because logic only works with logical people. These people will just use it as a point to argue against you with.",
            "In my limited experience, no one lives like that without some serious mental problems. Does your sister or her partner have any issues with drug or alcohol addiction? Depression? I lived in squalor for quite awhile, and only realized after I was out of it that alcohol was probably a major part of the problem. \n\nHaving their children taken away may be the wake-up call they need to get their shit together. Depending on where they live it might not be a permanent action. It might give them motivation to kick the drugs and clean up their house/lives. \n\nAs for you taking the kids, I think it has been stated pretty well, you are under no obligation to take them, and it might ruin their lives as well as yours. They very well might get adopted, and they might even be able to stay together. My aunt adopted 4 children all from the same family who were living in a similar (possibly worse) situation, and they are crazy happy. ",

So they are assuming that you have \"extra\" that you can afford to spend on your nieces and nephews. They don't see it as a problem that it will drag your family's standard of living back down to the poverty level, because that's their level already.\n\nYou have to shut this down immediately. The longer you let your family think that you can just take an additional five kids into your home, the harder it's going to be to say 'no' later. The next time it comes up, you need to say \"We really can't afford to take them all.\" And stick to that.\n\nThey may be angry, they may think you're being greedy. Maybe you are, it doesn't matter.

The younger your kids are, the less you can do this.\n\nHowever, if you live in the same town offer to take all the kids for the day whenever you can. Get them cleaned up, fed, and assess their mental health. They may be better off away from their parents, especially if you can visit their foster home frequently. A hoarding house is not safe.\n\nWhile you have the kids, send in your most reliable relatives to talk to your sister and BIL. There's no use cleaning up if they don't care. Your relatives must convince her to avoid having another child. \n\nIf you can buy some sleeping bags and keep them overnight, that also gives your sister respite to think where things are at.",

Is your current financial situation stable or are you living closer to paycheck to paycheck? How much would it cost to feed and cloth all of these kids? Do you have any pets?\n\nDo your children get along with their cousins, have the cousins ever stayed over an extended period of time? It's very different to see someone occasionally and then suddenly live with them. \n\nCould you handle the stress of adjusting in five/six kids who have never been properly parented? It'd be a super stressful situation especially with your masters going on. \n\nNext. If you do somehow do this, what happens with your sister? Is this enabling her? She knows you and you and your family have enabled her in the past so she might not have to change meaning this situation could easily happen again.

It could simply be because \"I dont' want the extra work.\"  \n\nSo, what to do?  I would be straightforward with it.

            "Don't focus on the mother-- she's an adult, it's not your job to teach her a lesson or save her from her decisions or punish her or fail to punish her or any of that.  The only question is-- what is best for these 7-8 children?  You've already said that having all of them come to you is not what's best for them-- you will be spread too thin.  The whole situation is proof of what happens when parents have more kids than they have resources (financial, time, emotional).\n\nI think you should work with child services as a concerned aunt. Let them know that you have been visiting them and want to continue to visit them but be honest with yourself and them about how many you have the financial, emotional, physical resources to be their primary care givers.  You don't know-- there could be some great foster-parents or even adoptive parents and in that case, all the kids will be better off if some of the kids were to go there. Maybe you could act as an emergency for some if they are not put in a good home. Being someone who cares about them, sees them regularly and advocates for them will make a big difference for them. \n\nIn my experience as a teacher, though, I doubt they will be taken away.  I've seen much worse than gross house, kids being dirty, and parents on welfare without child services being very concerned. \n\nI think you should help by continuing what you're doing with the vacations and stuff and trying to be involved.  If you're close, then soon the 10 year old will be able to call you to tell you what's going on-- if there's no food and they're hungry, that type of thing.  I'm worried about their health and at least some missed meals, but a huge concern is their emotional well-being and their futures. I think having an aunt who you can look to as someone who is mentally healthy, who cares, who tells you that you have stuff to offer, that's really important when you have a sick mom who neglects you and you stink and are filthy so the people at school treat you badly.  Another thing you can probably do is to help your sister get all the supports that are out there-- often there are lots of forms to fill out, research to do and if she doesn't have much education or access to the internet, that might be keeping her from getting all the help she might be able to get.",

Their parents are a disaster. To them, you are a golden ray of sunshine. The foster system could break them even more so since there are 5. That means they'll most likely be split up. Probably the two youngest, the middle and the oldest alone. It's just speculation, but that is the most likely bet. I know it's a lot, but your and your husband are really all those kids have. Even if you decide not to take them please keep in contact. Calls, emails, visits. Stand with them if they have court dates. Let them know someone cares about them and their well being.

She still thinks she's doing nothing wrong so stop wasting your time.\n\nIt's not a matter of 'if' these kids get taken but 'when.' There aren't a lot of places that will take 5 kids so they may be split up.

            "At this point, I agree to let CPS do what they need to do. Those kids deserve better than what your sister is providing. Right now, you have to make it clear that you will not take them.

That's what your family is planning and it's going to crash and burn if you go through with it. Your sister will be Mom with no responsibilities and probably continue to have children because now the others live with you. She needs a serious wake up call. When the children are removed, they don't just send them to new families to be adopted. My mother in law is a foster parent and almost every time a new child comes into her home, she fights like hell to get them back to their parents, within reason. The goal of foster care is not to find new homes, the goal is to get kids out of an unsafe environment and to work with their parents to teach them and help them make it safe again. You can keep in contact with CPS and the foster agency and make sure they're OK, so don't feel like you're abandoning or giving up on them, this is the best thing you can do for them right now. Your sister is going to end up really hurting these kids and getting them out and into safe foster homes is the best thing you can do for them. ",

While taking care of 7 kids you certainly couldn't work and care for them, and help your sister in any way.",

Their clothes are soiled with dog shit?  They are underfed to the point of eating moldy food?  These kids are going to DIE.  Do the CPS people know these things are going on?  Because it seems absolutely negligent to me to be giving your sister a chance at this point.\n\nSo I was going to suggest you call CPS and urge them to act immediately, but actually I don't think that's strong enough.  You should call the police and urge them to arrest your sister and/or her husband for child abuse.  They deserve it, but more importantly, this is the only way I can think of that you might *actually* be able to prevent your sister from having another child.  \n\nAs for you taking the children, I think there is no shame at all in saying that five additional children is far beyond what you can handle.  You need to figure out how many of these kids you can care for to a standard that's acceptable to you, and offer to take no more than that many.  I know that means the kids will get split up, but they will probably get split up in the system anyway.  \n",

It sucks to split them up but foster care will anyway. At least this way, they have the same people around them. \n\nIf you don't even want to take one, then don't. It is a hard choice to make. ",

Try and get your sister to see sense that she could barely look after her existing 5 kids, let alone a 6th one. Let family know you can't take them in because it's financially impossible. Let the screaming match happen. If you're serious enough, your sister MIGHT realise she has no back up plan. I think this is probably one reason why she's doing nothing to improve the situation because she thinks you'll just take care of them. Break the reality to them sooner. If you're lucky, your sister MIGHT get her act together. Doubtful though. When the time comes, let your nieces and nephews know you love them, it's not their fault and just check up on all of them frequently to make sure they're doing fine. ",

LET CPS take them, encourage it even.    Your sister chose to have the kids, not you, it doesn't land on you to clean up after her and if you do it'll just never stop.

I don't even think people did that when a brood of kids this big got orphaned in the past. \n\nWhat you might want to consider if you can get your extended family to agree  is  that you take the youngest in (as it probably needs more care)  and the others get split up between other members of the family. That way they can still visit and not end up in foster care. \n\nIf that is not agreeable to them, then foster care is the only solution.

You'd love to do it, but you can't without harming both yourself and the children and their futures. The foster system can and has produced an beneficial environment for many children and if you simply can't provide better don't stress yourself or your family out about it.\n\nYou didn't make the decision to bring these kids into the world, and you can't hold yourself responsible for not being able to care for them.",

Foster care doesn't mean they disappear. They will probably be split up, and might not be close, but having an healthy, adult person who understands where they came from and knows what it took to get out could make all the difference. \n\nStudies have been done to show the difference between a loss or tragedy being difficult but managed, or being traumatic, can be just having one adult in the person's life who is stable and understanding.

I think what damaged them all the most was not having a single, stable adult figure in their lives. If your nieces and nephews have a trusted adult (you) they could come to if something wasn't right in their foster home, or if they needed an adult to talk to, or just needed to be around family, that would be more than enough on your part.

I know you love them but bringing them up in poverty and overcrowding in your home is not necessarily better than allowing the State with it's deep pockets to step in. \nPlease let all of your family know NOW that you will not take custody of them should they be taken by the authorities - maybe removing the safety net will cause your sister to smarten up.",

I think that in that case, EVERYONE of the members of your family should decide together, and not you being the only solution to this problem.\n If you take them with you, your sister will blame it on anyone and specially you because the people that do this kind of things (having lots of kids, never caring about getting a job, nor at least have a bit of shame in the way they live in) always finds someone to blame about their own decisions. They can think of a million excuses to pull the blame on everybody else except on them. And more if is a sick person with a personality disorder. Or maybe don't even care, I'm not sure.\nAnd if you don't take them, you'll feel guilty about them not having the future and family they need by their side and all of the things we wish to give our children. But what I would do, is to talk about it with my husband, see if we can really sustain 5 more kids and if that's what we want for our future. In my country, there are so many families wishing to adopt a kid with all the economic security guaranteed, and they spend years waiting, and in the meantime there are a lot of kids in this kind of situations waiting to be rescued, or only given the possibility to be happy, healthy and schooled.\nA parent is not the one that gives birth, is the one that chooses to raise, take care of you and love you and teach you to be the best they can, doesn't matter the situation.",
            "No. You should not take the children. OP, I was in a similar situation only a few years ago; it was my 5 yr old nephew who has Asperger's. It was a tough decision but I knew it was the right decision for me, my husband, and teenage children. I'm sure some people think it was selfish, but I knew that I would resent taking him, resent him, resent my sister for (yet again) having me bail her out of a mess that was completely avoidable), and the significant changes it would make to our lives. No child should be raised on resentment. What I did do, what help find a family willing to make him a part of their family. A family that could better meet his needs than I could. It's been two years now, and although it isn't perfect (what family or parent is), he is doing so much better, and I know that we wouldn't have been able to get him where he is today. Our lifestyle just wasn't child friendly anymore and none of our friends have young children either. You have to take care of yourself first. This is one of those rare extreme situations where helping others cannot take priority over your life long wellbeing. ",

Perhaps managing grad school is easier.",
            "So I don't think you should take the kids.  It will be almost impossible for you and your husband to really provide for seven or eight kids, unless you are doing fantastic.yeah, they will be better off than they are now,but would most people realistically be able to give those kids the lives they need? \n\nIt just may seem to your family that you are so much better off, you can handle this. But these things are cycles. Not to be harsh, but folks in your family don't PLAN on kids, or on providing for them. Growing up where I did, I often saw the mentality that kids just happen, and you basically suffer through it. They often don't totally see that people making different decisions is what makes them get out of crap lives, not just luck. So a lot of times, people like your family act like they were just dealt a terrible hand and you somehow escaped that, not through working hard, or different choices, but just that you somehow slipped through the hands of a terrible fate. \n\nPlus, if you take these kids, your family is going to try to influence them. The best thing is getting away from this nonsense.\nHere is a scenario: Kids mom wants to come over drunk spontaneously, and cussed out the kids. If they are in your custody, your family will pressure you to let her keep having contact.\nIf they are in state custody, social workers and foster families don't have any sort of family intervention to keep them from putting an end to that. Mom and dad want visits? They can be supervised. Keep messing up, we will tell the judge.  The parents can't just drop in whenever they want, and if grandma has a problem with foster parents not dropping everything and letting parents taking the kids out unsupervised? Who cares? She can turn on you f you were the foster parent though. Probably why they want you to take them. They don't all collectively have to take care of them, parents are happy, and you can shoulder the financial and emotional burden while they play house whenever.\n\nSo that is why I think you shouldn't do it. Most people can't really provide for eight kids well, and even if you are the exception, you would have to basically move away and not tell anyone where you were. Otherwise, those kids would have a better life, but any progress they make would often be undercut by your family.\n\nGood luck! I am sorry you are in this situation and I feel terrible for those kids. I honestly hope they are taken away. Maybe they can get some help if they are.",

If you let them get adopted out, a family who will love them as their own children is possible.

Foster parents get a monthly stipend per kid, and in many states the parents are actually charged child support to cover this. You seem to think that you taking in the kids = they just end up with you, without any support. That does not have to be the case. \n\nThe best thing you can do for them and you is to get yourself connected to CPS as a potential foster parent NOW. That means you can receive a stipend and other assistance. The kids will not just be dumped into your lap. CPS can also offer support help, such as counseling for the kids, and supervise visits with their parents.\n\nGetting involved with CPS as a potential foster parent also means that you have a great way to resist the inevitable pressure from your family to just give the kids back to your sister on the DL. \n\nIf your sister's kids end up in other foster homes, they will almost certainly be split up. They might end up in situations where they literally never see each other again. This happened to my family and I cannot even begin to describe to you how destructive it was, for all of us. Destroying these relationships has lifelong consequences and they are not good.\n\nIf you have to cut back on material benefits for your kids (by which I mean non-vital material goods, not stuff like food, shelter, etc) I think that's actually minor compared to what you will be giving to them: lessons in kindness and compassion, as well as the benefit of a close relationship with their cousins, and a feeling of security in knowing that their parents are the kind who step up and commit to children. \n\nPlease feel free to PM me if you want more in-depth explanations, ideas, or support.

            "I have heard of only one instance where raising a siblings children actually worked well. The mother was in prison and could not stir up drama and the aunt who took the kids in was wealthy and loving. The kids turned out great and love the aunt and uncle that raised them and have no contact with bio mom. \n\nI think having bio mom out of the picture is essential if you are thinking of helping these kids.\n\nI was reading recently that social workers have been surprised by the number for extended family members willing to take in kids if social workers ask them and the alternative is foster care. (On Mobil so I don't have a Link) Do you have any cousins, or other more distant relatives that are sane?",
            "My mom took her brothers kids in when they were taken away. She had 5 of her own and he had 2, so it's not as extreme of a situation,  but similar in humber of people. \n\nLing story short, it didn't help my cousins. All my mom's kids turned out to be responsible adults, but my cousins didn't. My male cousin knocked up a 40 year old woman when he was 19, and had been in and out of jail. My female cousin is having her 4th kid with a different dad than the others. There was no difference in treatment when they were growing up with us. ",
            "Honestly, I don't think you should take them. Supporting eight children is going to be a nightmare financially and emotionally. I know they're family but I think you need to consider your own family first and the negative effect this will have on them. Don't let your own children pay for the mistake of your sister.",
            "This makes me feel so much better about my life. This is a fucking hard question. Is there anyway you can divvy them up? Your parents get a kid or two, you get one, some responsible aunts or grandparents step up to the plate? I dunno I've never allocated human lives before. None of your family sounds intelligent or emotionally sound, so even if you make a rational decision, if it's not what they want to hear they will freak out. I'm no believer in eugenics but a piece of me thinks that some kind of lower bound would be nice to prevent 5 children from living in squalor because their parents are unfit to take care of a cactus.

            "You will most likely get some kind of assistance if you take them in order to help you.  Usually food stamps and TANF.  It obviously won't cover everything but it might help a little?\n\nIs your sister hooked up with any community programs?  There are some that can help with ongoing case management, clothing, job training, etc.  It kind of sounds like your sister has mental health issues and that's why her life is in disarray like this.",
            "> So Reddit, should I just bite the bullet and take the kids in when they get removed?\n\nDo you want to take them in? Reddit can't tell you that. \n\nChances are if you do that you can get financial help from the govt. (you should check into this now). Also, if they're used to being neglected they will probably be quite independent. Even the really little ones...\n\nBut, if you're going to hate having them the may well be better off with a foster family who wants them. It's kind of a crapshoot though. Some people are horrible and just see foster kids as an income source.\n\n>  I also wanted to ask if there is any way I can help my sister besides the cleaning etc? \n\nIn my experience, no. Probably not even with cleaning, unless maybe you want to hire a maid service. Because the basic habits and will to act are not there. You'll be cleaning one room while the room you just cleaned gets trashed. And if you're extra lucky, your sister will either take your cleaning as a slight, or decide she's entitled to you as housekeeper.\n\nHelp the kids, they're the ones who have no choice in the matter. Even if they go into foster care, you can keep in touch and make sure they are ok. You can also do stuff like teach them the skills they need to take care of themselves (how much do you want to bet they have no idea how to clean their own stuff etc because no one is teaching them how?).\n\nWhat you realistically can do for her is help her if and when she makes moves to help herself. If she gets into therapy, be all about removing obstacles (transport, childcare). If she says she wants to clean the house, offer her cleaning supplies. So on so forth. But don't try to do the work for her, it doesn't work. ",

She needs to get her shit together and her kids shouldn't have to suffer while she's doing that. Whether or not you take them they need to be removed. They are being abused. I would have called CPS on them already. ",
            "I've been in a similar situation. Only responsible sibling and brother had 3 kids in similar circumstances. There was no way I was going to let those children go into foster care. I wouldn't let any child go into foster care if I have a way to prevent it. Taking them would put 6 kids in my home and all the stipulations involved would put so much, including my job, at risk. When CPS got involved we all met as a family, extended and all, to discuss who would be doing what to contribute and to lessen the negative impact on my family. Everyone else who could contribute genuinely can't physically care for 3 small children but we had a plan in place to lesson the burden on me and mine. Thank god it didn't come to that point but I felt we were prepared. May not be much help but that's how we handled it. I don't think I would have gone through with letting them go but made it very clear I would if everything was put on me.",

I imagine you love your niblings and want to take them in so that they are cared for in a loving and healthy environment, but that is so many children and will certainly have a very negative effect on your family's life. \n\nDo you have the money to hire a housekeeping service to go to their house every couple of weeks? Can you convince her to get her tubes tied or at the very least get an IUD or some long term birth control? Can you drive her to her psych appointments or advocate on her behalf with CPS to get her more respite? Could you take in her animals or help find homes for them so she doesn't have to care for them as well as 5 children?",
            "Lol nope. And you're a damned fool if you think you can do otherwise.\n\nKnow your limits. You can't do it, even if you wanted to. They are ball and chains to you. While your concern is admirable, you must see it from the financial point of view.",
            "Think about having to raise 7 (or 8!) kids and what that would entail for you and your husband. You can forget your Masters and most of your hopes and plans for your future and for your own 2 kids. This is just far too much for your family or anyone to expect from you and for you to expect from yourself. You know you can't take those kids, don't feel guilty about it. I believe the saying around here is: \"don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm\"",
            "> I also wanted to ask if there is any way I can help my sister besides the cleaning etc? She's clearly over her head and I'm concerned with her mental well being. I want her to get better so she can keep her children.\n\nI'm more worried that you think helping your sister keep the children is a viable option at this time. It's not. She cannot cope and those children deserve better than she can give them.",

She was in and out of foster care and is desperate to not have her nieces and nephews go through that. \n\nSo, if you are able to, yes, I think you should try to take them in if need be. However, I would be proactive and try to work with your sister so that they are taken care of properly. Maybe remove the pets from the property, go to goodwill and get some appropriate clothes for the children, etc. \n\nIt's hard. I couldn't imagine it.

            "My paternal cousins are like your sister, only imagine it multiplied by a factor of four. Before you add in that some of my cousins kids are now having kids of their own. They're all on some sort of something illegal, and quite a few of them live with my grandma (who has Alzheimer's).  Her house has two bedrooms and 8 people living there....including kids. I'm the black sheep because I refuse to get involved with their shenanigans. Or give them money. Or let some of them stay with me when they decide to load up and go to Branson (I live further from Branson than they do....by an hour). Apparently \"having a job\" and \"paying my bills\" is uppity and I'm a snob. \n\nMy opinion: if you take in your nieces and nephews, your sister will have more and expect you to take care of them to. She's a mooch. You're free babysitting and food in their eyes, and all they see when they look at you is what you can do for them. ",

And you can stay involved in your nephews and nieces lives, since CPS tries very hard to keep stability involved in the children's lives. Perhaps, you could continue your annual camping tradition.\n\nThere are lots of loving foster parents out there. It's past time that these children be removed from the home. The parents should face negligence and abuse charges.\n\nGood luck, this is never an easy situation.",

            "I'd start by checking your vocabulary.  If this really feels like biting the bullet (which usually means they're about to cut into you or cut off a limb), don't do it.  If it's at the cost of your own or your immediate family's health and well-being, that's too high a price to pay.\n\nOn the other hand, all these kids need is consistency, love, food and a decent environment, and maybe some social work/therapy if they've been messed up in the head.  You don't need a bigger car or house necessarily, but what you would need is support.\n\nIf it looks like the kids might be taken away anyway, you might consider talking to social services and seeing if you could officially foster them, in which case you'd have some financial assistance from the state in taking care of them.\n\nOn the other hand, you could also reach out to social services and build a relationship with the case worker.  The foster system isn't always so great for kids, but if you are a partner in this process, you could make sure that you can visit the kids regularly if and when they are placed in care, and be on the alert for any situation which is not in their best interest.\n\nIf you look, I bet there is also some money available, in grants or supplemental support from private agencies, maybe even religious groups.\n\nI suspect there is a way to take them on and stay sane, but it might take some creativity.",

            "as difficult it might be given the amount of children. is there a chance instead of someone taking in all children, but working out with the wider family (including her husbands side) how many they can each take care of. splitting siblings is hard, but with modern tech and regular gatherings they can still be in family/sibling contact. While your sister sorts herself to be more stable. might be worth finding out what foster system is like in this area, some places it can be fair or unfair or if they can get the kids back at a better point or stay in contact",
            "Perhaps you can arrange with child services to take them for a weekend or for outings when they're settled with their new families etc if you don't want to lose contact :)",
            "Another way of looking at this- Suppose you did take them in, however, its too much work, your finances go to shit, etc.- what happens to your family?  In the end, the kids might end up splitting up anyway, but what about your kids?  Your priorities should be your family first.  Since both your husband and you have worked so hard to provide a good life for your kids, all your hard work could possibly be in danger, along with your kids well-being- physical and emotional.  People can only change when they want to.  When you enable them, you're just stuck with a mess, and end up angry and resentful.  Don't put your own kids thru it because this may get a lot messier than you can possibly imagine, and you really don't know if your own family will survive it.",
            "How many kids could you afford to take in?  How many would you actually want to?  Which ones?\n\nYou keep saying it's none of your business, but that's not true.  The welfare of children is **everyone's** business.  You're not wrong for thinking that your sister and BIL are terrible parents.  It's okay to admit that.  That said, you don't have to take in any kids if you don't want to.  \n\nBut if you would take 1-2 of the kids, do you have any family members who could also take 1-2?  That way, even if they're split up, they're* still with family?",
            "Hopefully I am not too late OP. I actually went through practically the same thing except they were my brothers kids (3). I was the first to graduate from college also. He and his  wife were druggies and CPS ended up taking the children. They stayed in custody due to my brother actually trying to turn his life around. My brother ended up passing away and I was left with a choice. Allow the kids to be adopted out by the state or take them myself. The first decision you have to make is wether you can afford it. Even if you adopt special needs kids, the subsidy is low. About 400 per kid in Texas. The next decision I stress is that you have 100 percent support from your SO. If you don't, you have to be able to understand that it could lead to divorce (happened for me). The last part has to do with love. You need to be able to love them because they will need you more than anything. If you can't do those things, then you need to let them go.",
            "My younger sister was a life long serious alcoholic who lost her one marriage after she got drunk and stuck a shotgun in her mouth on the front lawn in front of a cop and pulled the trigger - the gun misfired, trashed her family by claiming that some members did vile things to her - she just constantly lied to everyone about everything and told lies to her family and other people just so she could get what she wanted.  She had a young lover half her age for a time and when he wouldnt take her to buy booze she jumped out of the car at 50 miles and hour and broke her arm. I say all this to say she was a dangerous, manipulative crazy bitch 90% of the time.  One day she decided to go on a real bender and got so blottoed she felt that she needed someone to watch her little boys aged 2 and 4.  She kept calling my niece to come over and be with the kids but my niece couldnt go so my brother went over to get the boys.  My sister was so pissed off that my brother showed up to get the kids and not my niece that she called the cops and told them someone was trying to kidnap her children.  They came and while talking to her saw that she had a marijuana plant growing in a plastic jug on the windowsill.  They wound up arresting her and my other brother who also lived there (to help her with expenses.)  Of course child protective services were called to the scene but my brother told the cops he was there to take the kids to their grandmothers and they let him leave with the boys.  My 72 year old mom on social security petitioned the courts to be their relative caregiver.  From then on the boys lived at that house. They still do.  My mom passed away 6 years later and my two unmarried brothers agreed to stay in the house and help raise the boys.  I agreed to help too.  I live about a half mile away.  The boys mom, my sister died from alcoholism three years after my mom died.  Their biological father died of an overdose about 3 years ago but he had lost parental rights anyhow when they were little.  So essentially the boys have been raised by their two uncles and me their aunt.  We are the only parents they have ever really had.  I never had kids and my brothers are unmarried. One brother drinks every day and the other brother was formerly a crack addict.  we are all dirt poor but we try to give the boys what they need so they will have a good life.  So far at 22 and 19 they are doing pretty good.  They still don't have regular jobs because we live in a very rural area.  But they both got through high school and I took them driving and to take their roadtest this past year so they have licenses.  They aren't addicted to substances,  they seem pretty well adjusted.  They know their family loves them. Being poor isn't a bad thing if kids know they are loved.  You really need to search your heart.  forget about your crazy ass sister.  She already wrote her life story.  Theirs is yet to be written.  sure you are not \"mom\" you are \"aunt\" but the little one will call you mom.  Its just how it happens.  My niece overheard the 4 year old say to the 2 year old after they came to my mom's house, \"It's okay D...., Grandma and L... will protect us.\" What those kids need is not much more than feeling safe, having shelter and food, and knowing love.",
            "Also, what is your upper limit? She could have ten more. Will probably have 1-2 more",
            "Just to speak to financial side, in my state, foster parents receive a monthly subsidy per-child, even if they are related to help offset the care of the kids. If the child has medical issues: asthma, allergies etc, the subsidy is higher. \n\nIn my state foster children get free health care. CPS pays for extra things like daycare and after school programs. They help with transportation, counseling and a lot of other things. \n\nThe feasibility and the practicality of OP's situation is a totally separate question, but financially and logistically she likely would have a ton of support.

            "There are alot of comments on this so I hope you will see mine!  I am a foster parent to a sibling group of 4.  They have 3 other siblings who were also taken from their bio parents under similar circumstances that you describe.  The siblings of the bio parents either refused custody of their neices & nephews, or couldn't pass a home study or drug test.  Firstly, I want you to know that if the kids go into foster care, you will have an opportunity later to take them, if you wish to do so.  You would not have to make the decision immedately.  Also, the court will likely allow visitation with you and your children if you ask for it.  So why am I telling you this?  Because I want you to know that you will have time to monitor the foster situation, and perhaps your sister & her husband will shape up and get their kids back.  If not, and if you have any concerns about the well-being of your nieces/nephews while they are in foster care, you can change your mind and take them in later.  If, like my foster kids, your nieces/nephews end up in a loving, supportive foster home that complies with family visits, the kids may actually be better off than if you take them and struggle to support 7!  In our case, we are adopting the 4 we have and the other 3 are being adopted by another foster family.  We are very close with them and the 7 siblings see other regularly. Foster families sometimes get a bad rap because there are some that are not ideal, but there are many loving and wonderful foster families, and families, like ours, who want to adopt from foster care and will provide your nieces/nephews with a great home & family.  Good luck!",
            "One or two kids-- yes, it's reasonable. But five kids? Maybe a sixth? That's a possibility of eight kids in your home, and sacrificing any possibility of you and your husband ever having more of your own. \n\nThat would financially and physically drain you. It is in no way your responsibility to play the bank, social worker and caretaker of your family just because they see you as 'better off' for breaking a cycle of drop outs. This needs to be addressed to your family, otherwise they will unfortunately suck you back into it.",
            "No, you should not just take in 5 children that are not yours because your family is inept. \n\nI feel for your nieces and nephews, but if your family is so concerned then they can help out. i'd say you've done enough.",

As you can imagine, I've had a chaotic week so far and it has been intensified by the upcoming holidays. \n\nI met with my lawyer friend this last weekend and had a five hour heart to heart with him. He reiterated many comments that were posted in the above threads, and told me that him and other people had noticed little things here and there throughout my relationship with my wife. There was a lot of crying as I broke down, but I was happy to finally have honest support from someone IRL through this. He advised me to get copies of documents that proved that I had complete ownership or partial ownership of our home, cars and other items, and I have secured all of this as of today.\n\nI have not seen my wife or my children since Sunday evening. That night we had a loud, painful argument. I yelled at her for the first time, and she called me a loser and a useless man, and blamed the impending doom on me. I have 75+ missed calls on my phone from her and her parents and even more text messages, some from our oldest child saying she doesn't want to \"see daddy anymore\". I suspect my wife and her parents have been putting her up to it, but it is extremely heart breaking to say the least.\n\nMy marriage is over. My life is crumbling. \n\nI am bracing myself for the worst. My friend has introduced me to someone who can help me file for the divorce, and the estimated time for my wife to be served with these papers is by the end of the work day. My only regret is that I won't be there to see her face. After re-reading the two threads for a week, I am sure I never want to see that woman's face again. Unfortunately this will be inevitable during the divorce process.  \n\nSome of you will be pleased to know I am not barricading myself in a cheap motel, but am taking a well earned little stay in a luxury hotel in the city, right by my office. Just figured I might as well enjoy life before shit hits the fan. Room service and house keeping all the way!\n\nI want to thank everyone again for your advice and support. Please, if there is anyone out there who has been through this, I would love further support and advice. I will be checking back on this throwaway and thread throughout the day. \n\nI am done posting update threads on /r/relationships. If there is anything you would like to know about my situation, I can answer in the comments of this thread or via PM. \n\nLots of love, and happy holidays everyone! I'll be spending the holidays locked in my hotel room eating peanut butter sandwiches all by myself. \n\n**tl;dr**: Met with lawyer friend who got me started on the divorce process. Had a loud first/last argument with my wife on Sunday night, she called me a loser and a broken man. Left home that night and I'm staying in a luxury hotel as a treat. Oldest daughter texted me saying she doesn't want to see me anymore, but I suspect my wife and in laws put her up to this. Wife will be served papers by the end of the work day. Taking this in strides, but it is extremely painful. ",

            "Geez, OP. I wish you all the best, man. \n\nA word of advice, from a woman who grew up with divorced parents from an early age: when you're with your kids, don't trash talk their mom, no matter what. My dad was terrible about it -- and he was the fun, every-other-weekend dad that always bought me cool toys and took me to do exciting things. But his constant efforts to twist me against my mother eventually ended up destroying my relationship with him. I never stopped loving my dad, but I did stop wanting to be around him. No matter what your soon-to-be ex-wife does or says, don't sink to her level. With time the kids will realize what the real deal is.

Another factor that might be at play is her desire to please her mom and get her approval.  As a child of divorced parents myself, I remember always siding with my mom in arguments and talking shit about my dad, even though my mom was the more demanding/critical/difficult parent and my dad was always super chill.  As a young girl, I was desperate for my mom's approval and would do/say anything, even if it meant bashing my dad, because mom's approval was much more difficult to get, and I knew my dad would always love me no matter what.  I wouldn't be surprised if this was happening to your daughter too, even if she doesn't realize it now.

My only advice is to stay above her level and just focus is on being a good Dad.  You will drive yourself insane trying to stop the games she will drag them into, and if you try she'll double down because it is working.  Do what you can to maintain normalcy in their life, it's what they need and they will thrive because of it.  Don't be surprised how far she will stoop, keep your ear to the ground.  She's already demonstrated that she is willing to bring emotional harm on your kids if it means hurting you as well.  My ex spiraled into a string of bad decisions that has left me, after $17000 and multiple trips to court, with full physical custody and working on full legal as we speak.

            "Good, you're getting divorced. This also shows men can be physically/emotionally abused as well.",
            "I have a few thoughts about this. \n\n1. I can't help but wonder how this could have had your first and last loud fight? You married a woman and had three children and have never had a fight before? This seems a little strange for such an advanced relationship. It's certainly out of the ordinary. \n\nIf it is indeed true then I could see how your wife would be shocked and surprised when you finally stood up for yourself. When a spouse acts totally different than what the partner is used to it can complicate the situation. I'm not saying you don't have the right to act the way you want to, but understand that she may not be prepared to handle the new behavior in a healthy way. \n\n2. The second thing that occurs to me is when you mentioned that her behavior changed specifically after the birth of your third child. I have heard of his happening before, where a woman's body and brain chemistry completely changes after the birth of a child. Did you discuss this with her? Does she notice that things changed drastically after the birth of your third? She may have something to say about this. There might me an actual biological reason for the change. \n\n3. Did her behavior change at all after she really understood how serious you are about separation? Is this an issue of her having a permanent behavior change or could she be having a few bad months and taking you for granted? If she changed her behavior and made an effort would you give her another chance?  You married this woman and had three children with her so you must have liked something about her. \n\n4. Have you tried couples counseling? Sometimes a person needs to hear things from a third party. She seems to go to her family for support when you do anything she doesn't like. Advice from family will always be biased, but a nutral party can sometimes help objectively. Maybe if you did couples counseling and she heard that her behavior was unacceptable from someone outside the family or friends-group she would react differently? \n\nFrom a guy that was in a similar circumstance for almost 9 years you have my sympathy. When there are three kids involved it might be worth it to investigate every avenue before making a final decision. You might regret a knee-jerk decision somewhere down the line. Think carefully about your actions, that's all I'm saying. Good luck!",
            "Get a go pro camera or alike, and record all and any interaction with her and your children, specially at the moment you go picking them up,",
            "Wow. \n\nI only just read your first two threads, and not that it counts for much, but I'm really sorry you're going through this. She sounds like a really mean spirited person, and I'm glad you're doing what's right for you, but the emotional manipulation you're being subjected to is just atrocious - and honestly, I reckon she actually wrote the text that came from your daughter's phone, not that there's any way of proving that besides asking your daughter. \n\nI hope she's able to find a shred of civility to display regarding custody so your kids don't suffer too much.\n\nOn the plus side, you're still quite young - doesn't negate the fact that your life thus far has gone to shit, but you are now free to find someone else who is deserving of you. I feel sorry for the poor fucker she moves onto.",
            "Okay, divorce. Let's talk practical consequences. They are huge, particularly if children are involved. And that you are male puts you at an immediate disadvantage as far as the courts are concerned, because whether anyone wants to admit it or not, gender roles play a role in how many things, especially custody, pan out. \n\nIt's getting better incrementally\u2014and some states are better than others\u2014but where kids are concerned most judges default to awarding custody to the mother and assigning the father visitation rights. And that will have tremendous, maybe even debilitating, impact on you financially. I can't stress that enough. If you're a middle-income earner, you will be poor for years, as at least 25 per cent of your income after taxes is awarded to your wife as child support. Look at your take-home pay now, do some math and get ready. Or be prepared to fight to be the custodial parent.\n\nAnd if this does become a fight, your lawyer will cost you thousands and thousands of dollars. If you and your wife can be civil enough to use mediation, try to go that route, because custody agreements that don't rely on a judge's biases can be forged during that process. But be alert to how the mediators guide the you both and *stick up for yourself, dammit*. Don't give anything away, because you will regret it later.\n\nAnd since you've mentioned this so many times, I need to say one last thing about crying. It's been politically correct over the last decade or three to say that it's okay for men to cry, but the reality is that it's simply not. I'm not offering judgment here, just stating that as a man, in this society, you may not shed tears in front of someone else, except maybe your mother, I guess, or you will be judged as weak. \n\nDon't cry in front of your children. They don't want to see it, it will engender even further contempt from your wife (she may use it against you in mediation or court to illustrate mental instability) and will do nothing for your self respect.\n\nCry if you must, but keep your tears private. And never, ever, cry in front of your wife\u2014she is now your adversary, and although I doubt very much you'll ever have her respect as a man, you're going to need her respect as an opponent, should it come to that (and I hope it doesn't, truly). At some point you have to stop crying, pull yourself together and fight for yourself and your interests.\n\nAll of the above may seem harsh, but I lived through it myself. You need to stay strong, avoid feeling sorry for yourself, and ask yourself what behaviors you can demonstrate now that will earn the respect of your children as they grow. What do you want them saying about the way you conducted yourself during their parents' divorce when they're older? I think about that a lot with my own kids. \n\nFinally, if you don't exercise, start now. It'll make you feel better about yourself, give you some confidence, and be a reminder that though there are things outside your control during all of this, you do have control over something. Go to /r/bodyweightfitness and start in on the pushups.\n",

Let the lawyers talk and do not violate ANY court order. She'll keep pushing to get her way and eventually she'll make a mistake. When she does, you'll have the courts on your side. ",

When she gets served with those divorce papers she's going to go full on ballistic.  \n\nIn the US she is legally allowed to take every penny out of shared bank accounts so long as both your names are on the accounts and there won't be a damn thing you can do about it because it's both your money so far as the law is concerned.

You want your credit frozen so she can't open any new accounts with your name attached to it for the same reason as your current shared accounts.  Finally you need the safe place to stay so you can try and protect yourself from anything she may do like file a false police report claiming you hit her or that you molested one of your children or you forced yourself on her.  All she has to do is tell a judge that she fears for the safety of herself or your kids around you and next thing you know your no longer allowed in your own house.  No longer be allowed to see or speak to your children unless it's through an intermediary. \n\nYour wife is a horrible, vindictive person who has been intentionally hurting you at ever opportunity she get. Please do not think for one second that she wouldn't make up some lies in an attempt to hurt you even more in an attempt make you lose your children, your job, your reputation, friends, family, etc.  You need to make sure both you and your children are taken care of at this point. You can't very well take care of your children from a jail cell or unemployed with out a place to live and a protection from abuse order that forces you to not come within a few hundred feet of either your wife or your kids. \n\nGood luck sir.

My father (45M) and Anna have been together for a bit more than 18 years. Before that my Dad and my mom had a fling that lasted 3 months and then it ended and he met Anna.\n\nMy mom and dad didn\u2019t talk until I was 3, so both my dad and Anna were unaware of my existance. My mother didn\u2019t want to tell him, or didn\u2019t care. I don\u2019t know. What i do know is that when I was 3 she contacted him, a DNA test was done and she basically forced us to have a relationship.\n\nWhile this was a shock to my father, Who suddenly had a 3 year old walking around his house, it probably was a bigger shock to Anna. Who thought that she had just moved in with a child less man yet she got both a boyfriend and a toddler.\n\nAnna has been, from Day 1, a brillant person. I always felt welcome, she drove me to school, to the doctor\u2019s, to playdates, to hockey practice. She thaught me to ride \u00e0 bike, included me in everything yet gave me and my dad the space to have our own relationship as father and daughter.\n\nShe never imposed herself, she never made the decisions which concerned me, she left that for my dad and mother. She always talked respectfully of my mother, even when I was mad at my mom. Even when my mom Said mean things about her, Anna never said mean things about her.\n\nMy relationship with my mother is not good. But I am happy to have Anna in my life. I see and hear from friends with stepparents how difficult it can be. I read and hear about kids who were ignored because their parent\u2019s new partner didn\u2019t want to them be a part of their lives.\n\nI was wondering how I can express my gratitude to Anna for everything she die to me?\n\nEDIT: Oh my God, this blew up. Sorry I didn\u2019t read this sooner. It\u2019s almost midnight here but I will try to answer each and every one of you.\n\n\nTl;dr: How to thank my stepmom?",

Like others said, what about a letter?  Or what about photo album/scrapbook page or something with pictures of both you together?  I really think anything you do to thank her will be welcomed with big, loving hugs and lots of them.\n\nYou could be silly and MAKE her a sweet, funny card.  These are my most loved things.  I am a mom to a 12f and 14f.  My oldest STILL makes silly pun cards for me.  My favorite is a handmade drawing of a mom raisin and a baby raisin.

            ">Tl;dr: How to thank my stepmom?\n\nTell her.  In writing, if in-person seems too hard.\n\nFWIW, my wife is a step-mom to my two kids from my previous marriage.  They were older teens when I remarried, so she never had a hand in day-to-day child-rearing, but she otherwise behaved towards them as Anna did to you.  One year, my daughter gave my wife a Mother\u2019s Day card, and had written in it that she felt like she\u2019d gained a second mom (in a good way! \ud83d\ude02).  That was short and to the point, and my wife was moved to tears by it.\n\nSo, don\u2019t worry about writing a novel.

(not important because we are talking your story here)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA step parent faces unique challenges\n\n1. They are not your parent so do not command and automatic respect, that hard to define blood connection (which is real by the way)\n2. The other person of your gender, the real parent that you represent when they are not around, can be known to cause you trouble (you mention your mother telling you bad things about stepmother)\n3. Your partner/spouse can refuse to share responsibility or in fact just not thought through the responsibilities and consequences to the child If they do not support you or share a common plan.\n\nConsequently step parents often follow a road that has no warning signs, bridges washed out and un advertised speed limits so you can get a speeding ticket, often, from any one of the people above, or all of them at the same time. It is frustrating, scary and can hurt \u2026 a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what would touch me deeply if you were my step daughter?\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nA thank you\n\nLove\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow would this be best conveyed?

She definitely had an impact on you as you're very grateful of her. Let her know, let her know. :)",

            "This makes me happy. My step mom came into my life when I was 10. I was shy, scared, hurt, emotionally unstable.  But she loved me. She loved me enough to argue with my dad when it came to letting me do stuff. Both for me going and against me going. She has always looked out for what is best for me. She covered me with protection and and care. Christmas was always filled with objectively too many gifts, for her kids her step kids and her grandkids. \nShe has never made me feel like \"just a step daughter\" even when people would confuse me with her much older biological daughter. She would just smile and say no this is my daughter _____. If a further explanation was needed she gave it. \nLately I've been realizing just how much I lucked out on who my dad chose. Especially in a time that he wasn't making too many good decisions.

I also told him that \"if [he] ever fucking touches me again, I will call the police.\", to which he told me to \"Mind my language\" (because him attacking me is fine but me swearing at him is apparently too far). He then went on to say (after saying \"now that you've finished your lecture\") that somehow I pushed the wrong buttons last night (insinuating that it was my fault he attacked me) and that the only other time this has happened was also with me. \n\nI held my ground and told him that regardless of me \"pushing the wrong buttons\" attacking your own son is completely unacceptable and that if it had been anyone else, they would have called the police and he would be in jail.\n\n\nI then added that it would be a while before I could trust/ talk to him again, and that all the effort over the past year to have a better father / son relationship has been completely wasted. \n\nI don't think he fully understands the gravity of the situation, but fuck him if he thinks he can do that to me and get away with it. I'm a god damn adult.\n\n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Talked with Dad, told him that if he touches me again I will call the police, that I can't trust / talk to him for a while and I've lost any sense of closeness with him.",

The people from my gym are like family. A couple from my gym with no kids let me stay in their guest room, and were super kind. Made me feel really loved.\n\nWhen I finally came back home, I sat down and talked to him, he tried to call the attack a \"reaction\" and a \"push\" on his part, even though I had a bruise (it was a hit). I just nodded and said ok, accepted the empty apology, etc. \n\nNow I just avoid him as much as possible, and keep all interactions to a pleasant minimum. \n\nNot ideal, but we do what we have to do to protect ourselves.\n\nBest of luck, stranger.",

            "> the only other time this has happened was also with me.\n\nAnd the reason for that is of course:\n\n> if it had been anyone else, they would have called the police and he would be in jail.\n\nSo the good news is, your father is sufficiently in control of his mental faculties and in control of his anger that he isn't attacking random people. He only attacks people when he thinks he can get away with it.\n\nI'd say your mother is at risk. But the both of you staying in order to protect each other, is not going to help either of you. The best thing you can do for your mother is to move out and create a stable, safe home for yourself (and maybe for her if she ever needs it).\n",
            "You've drawn your boundaries and that's a good thing.  The problem is he's not taking responsibility for his behavior & doesn't count on you (or your mom) enforcing those boundaries.\n\nWhile the water's have calmed for now, this very likely is not over.  Now, he's going to get himself into a mindset that you and your mom are either a.) teamed up against him or b.) planning something he isn't aware of.  The next time an altercation between the two of you arises (we know it will because there seems to be a long history of this type of volcanic activity where he's concerned & it's now escalating) you can expect it to be pretty serious.\n\nLong story short- a good course of action for you here is to follow other posters' advice, get your ducks in a row and get out.\nAn abuser's greatest lie is to make us believe we're stuck in the situation.  No one likes to admit that- no one.  These are people who we love and the life we've always known.  We don't want to believe they've somehow managed to convince us we're dependent on them- cuz I am adult and I don't NEED them.\n\nNo you don't.  There are other options.  Someone mentioned the FAFSA, there are grants, scholarships, there are SO many options and programs available to help get you those dollars to get yourself out of there sooner than you think.  And if you're thinking you don't qualify for any scholarships...there's a scholarship out there where the only requirement to apply for it is you have to have blue eyes...there's ALL kinds of people waiting to give money to people to go to school.\n\ntl;dr:  you're in a bad situation.

            "Don't know if this has been said, but the nature of the first physical assault is as red as a red flag can be. If he put his hands around your neck in an attempt to choke you then you need to get on this as soon as possible and do not hesistate to call the police.\n\nYou could easiy be in more danger than you might expect. Please do not hesistate to call the police next time. Honestly I feel you should make a report to get these instances on record asap. And here's the why you need to take this dead serious.\n\nMore than any other type of physical assault it's choking that correlates the most with people ending up dead. Abusers that strangle their victims are very likely capable of murdering the one they're choking. In some states assault with strangulation leads to stricter punishment because it is that damn dangerous. Also very easy to kill someone by choking them even if that's not the intention.\n\nIf he did put his hands on your neck to choke you you need to protect yourself as soon as possible. I'm so sorry you have to go through this. For your safety I would stress filing a report, if only for a paper trail.",

Please be careful. This guy is dangerous. I have escaped abusive situations before. It's hard, but doable despite not having any money. Hell, my father stole from me to help fund the shipment of a classic car he bought across country.
