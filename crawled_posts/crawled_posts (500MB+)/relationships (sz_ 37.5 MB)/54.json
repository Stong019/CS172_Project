He came to pick me up and I was still super nervous, even though by that time I was pretty sure it was a date. He opened the door of the taxi for me, but I went to go around the other side, thinking he was just getting in the car! He looked really confused until I figured out that he was being a gentleman and we both ended up laughing about it. It kind of broke the ice as he seemed a little nervous too.\n\nWe went for cocktails, then for dinner. Despite my insistence, he paid for everything and it was just perfect. We were chatting for hours and before we knew it, they were closing up around us.\n\nJim walked me to my taxi and kissed me goodbye. My stomach flipped over and I felt like a teenager - I couldn't stop grinning on the way home and fell asleep with a stupid smile on my face.\n\nThe next morning, I woke to find a text from him telling me how much he'd enjoyed our date and that he'd like to see me again soon. I couldn't wait either, so invited him over for dinner that Friday evening. He didn't leave until Sunday lunchtime. :-)\n\n**tl;dr**: It was a date. We are now dating and I feel like I've won the lottery. :-)",

I got some really helpful and empathetic replies which I was really thankful for. Post can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aajrls/my_depressed_partner_27f_and_the_effect_it_has\n\nI wanted to write abit of an update, partly for those who helped but also to show that it can sometimes get better. \n\nA couple of months back my partner was due to get her contraceptive coil removed. She struggled with irregular periods whilst on the coil so she decided that she didn't want a replacement and wanted to get back to a normal cycle. \n\nHonestly, her mood changed almost immediately. It was so quick. As soon as it was out, she started feeling better. Her want to do fun stuff has returned, and the sex drive is slowly increasing. We have already had wayyyy more sex in 2019 than we did in the whole of last year. \n\nShe is now off meds, and even though we are going through stressful times (moving house man... NEVER AGAIN!!!!), Her moods recover to a norm far quicker.\n\nWe do more family stuff now. I'm typing this from a camping holiday together, and my stepdaughter is doing well at home and at school, bringing home a brilliant report for the end of the school year.\n\nI don't want this post to come across as bragging. I just wanted to point out that it seemed that the cause of my partner's illness was a hormonal imbalance that was exacerbated by her contraceptive coil? I'm unsure of the science behind that but we are certainly doing better. \n\nThank you to all those who helped our situation before. \n\nTL;DR My partner struggled with depression until her contraceptive coil was removed. Our lives have improved alot since. Thank you to all those who helped and commented!",

            "This should always be considered when women change their reproductive system (or even as they enter into perimenopause). Thank you for posting this because a lot of people, women included, don't realize how serious this can be. \n\nIt was mind blowing for me to realize that after getting off the pill in my late 30s my PMS just went through the roof. I'm seeing a doctor about PMDD in a few weeks, and the knowledge that this is just my hormones fucking with me is so helpful. I'm not crazy. I don't suck. It's a medical condition that can be managed. I can get through this. \n\nI'm so happy that y'all are able to get through it as well.",
            "I'm not surprised that removing the coil had that effect. Contraception like that can have big effects on people, and it varies widely. When my wife went off the pill to something different, it had a very big effect on her. Glad to see things are going so well for your family. Wonderful news.",
            "I was so angry with doctors and people telling me the IUD had no side effects and was \u2018fantastic.\u2019 I had a horrible time on it, and glad I listened to myself and no one else and took the horrid thing out. Moods got better, infections disappeared and people said even my face got less puffy and back to normal. People don\u2019t realize it can really f*ck you up.",
            "Interesting. My psych reackons that the Mirena IUD is one of the leading causes of increases in depression/anxiety in women atm but the research isn't there because they don't want it to be (I know it sounds a bit conspiricy like but as a med prof I actually agree with her - funding goes to those that can afford most of the time, but hopefully with increases in mental health stuff it'd be good if they actually did fund some research into it...anyway...). \n\nI currently have one (have for the last probs 6 years or so??). Unfortunately for me, the Mirena IUD has been a lifesaver for me, as I have AWFUL PMS and cramping pains etc (like throwing up when I get periods cos the pain is so bad...) so not having a period since it's been in has been amazing. However it has made me wonder how much of my moods (would get low/high swings) has been me and how much is due to the IUD. However I've also got a family history of depression etc and am now on meds for it, which I think seem to help lift me outta the fog a bit. Just really interesting to hear it from another too. It's just annoying that the IUD for me has been so good. Wish there was a way to fix it without having the impact on moods etc so much. Anyway that's my 2c.\n\nGlad to hear things are improving! Ps never discount other meds or talking to someone if needed too, sometimes it can actually supplement the improvement process and really help too! \ud83d\ude0a Best of luck!",
            "That\u2019s great! I\u2019m curious \u2014 when you say coil, do you mean she was on the non-Hormonal copper iud or the other hormonal options?",
            "Birth control pills killed my libido (literally), among other great effects on my body. Luckily I found out It could be risky for my safety so I stopped taking them",
            "So scary that birth control can do this but my body depends on the pill I\u2019m on now. Hormones go mad as soon as I come off it. Depression, temper and crazy mood swings. But way higher sex drive. Honestly can\u2019t win",
            "Can I ask how SHE feels about the changes? What I mean to say is, was she aware of the behavioral changes or was it something that only you noticed. Im so happy that things are better for the both of you, being depressed and in a rut is hard and hard on those we love!",
            "This exact same thing happened to me. I battled severe anxiety and depression along with crazy mood swings. I truly started to feel psychotic. I knew something was wrong but couldn't figure out what could be causing it. After EIGHT months of this, I go to my OB for a regular check up. He asks how I'm doing on the pill. I said it's fine but then mention the anxiety and such. And he's the one who made the connection for me. I changed to another method and it was night and day. I felt like a brand new person. It sucks women have to go through this to avoid making babies... I feel for your girlfriend and every other woman who's gone through hormonal hell.",
            "Wow this blew up abit overnight!\n\nFor those asking, it was Mirena. Mixed with some tough times in life and getting rid made alot of difference. \n\nMy partner does still attend 'person centred councelling' though the sessions are alot easier than they were. \n\nThanks everyone!",
            "I had the Skyla IUD for about 9 months. I was more depressed than I've ever been in my life and didn't feel at all like myself. It also reversed almost immediately when I had it removed. Your girl is not alone!",
            "God I'm glad you figured it out. I had both the arm implant and the IUD implant... Absolutely horrible. I have depression as it is but wow, it literally made me suicidal.\n\nNeedless to say I'm on a low dose pill and doing a lot better- I'm glad she is, too.",
            "I'm so happy for you and your partner dude! Depression is hard, it requires a lot of commitment.",
            "I just finally sought help for my depression 5 hours ago. I thought I had it under control and tbh barely admitted to myself that was what was happening. It made me short with people at work and the love of my life. I hadn\u2019t realized it until a few days ago just how fucked up it all got.  I moved cities and haven\u2019t had much of a social life. I would say shitty things and lash out to those I care for. At times I would have suicidal thoughts and just feel an insane amount of grief which I couldn\u2019t understand because my life has been the best it has ever been these last few years. Even so I would still just cry and hide it from those I love. I didn\u2019t think about the effect my birth control has had on me too. Thanks for sharing. I\u2019m hoping to have the same result soon.",
            "My best friend went on the nuva ring after I told her how much I liked it. She basically went crazy. The hormones really fucked with her and the effects stayed there for a couple months. I had zero problems with it, except for it falling out. :)\n\nShe's got an IUD and I have a hormonal implant in my arm and it's still fine for me. Except acne. Boo. It's pretty crazy how that stuff can affect people differently.",
            "I\u2019m so happy for you guys! I\u2019m glad she\u2019s heading in the right direction and that you (finally) may have determined the issue. \n\nBirth control can be some crazy stuff. What works perfect for some women can make others depressed and apathetic. I felt like trash on the pill but settled into the shot just fine, no issues.\n\nIt might also be prudent to have her have a hormone panel done to see that everything is in good order again, too. Women, much like men, can have low testosterone, which can lead to the same depression etc we\u2019d see mentioned in those late night \u201clow T\u201d commercials aimed at men.",
            "Also, the biggest change we've experienced isn't necessarily the return of sex drive, but actually we've noticed we laugh together alot more. We have a goofy sense of humour so it's nice to be silly again.",
            " Birth control can do that. I was on the pill for a few months and realised that I had been WAY more depressed since starting that particular pill (I was on a different one before, but switched when I moved back to the UK after spending a year in the US). \n\nWhen I switched to the implant, my depression didn\u2019t go away bc I\u2019d always had it, but the improvement was amazingly noticeable. \n\nI\u2019m glad that this update is positive!",
            "I struggle with depression as well, and when I was with my ex, I was on hormonal birth control. It wrecked absolute havoc on my mood and exacerbated an already fairly serious issue. I was in a dark place internally, I gained a fair amount of weight, struggled with an eating disorder (existing problem but I had been on my way to recovery prior). When I went off the pill after he and I broke up, i almost instantly felt better, in the same way your partner did. I ended up switching to a copper IUD and I recommend it to everyone that I talk to about birth control. It gave me my life back lol. Glad to see a good update!",
            "Some birth control absolutely devastates certain people. It's no joke and so unfortunate. I love hearing a happy ending! Congrats!",
            "The science is that birth control screws women up to no end. It\u2019s sad and frustrating and difficult and it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone cares enough to make more than a few non-hormonal contraceptive methods and whether or not everyone has access to them. Even the female condom is twice the cost of a mans. *sigh* I feel for your gf and I\u2019m so so glad she\u2019s doing better.",
            "Are you talking about an IUD here?  My wife had one years ago before we started trying for a kid, and I swear her mood was heavily affected as well.   Very interesting.",
            "Hormones in your body can screw up your mental chemistry. There\u2019s an IUD called Paragard which is without hormones if she ever wanted to have that kind of protection again but without all the crazy hormones! It\u2019s 99.9% effective and honestly doesn\u2019t bother a lot of women one bit. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s doing better and that your relationship is getting stronger!!",
            "That's great news! The hormones in birth control can definitely mess with your head. I wanted to murder basically everyone all the time when I was on bc and I had no sex drive. That all changed when I stopped taking the pill.",
            "By coil do you mean IUD?",
            "I remember one year, my Dr changed my birth control and it really made a difference. I went from having a high sex drive, being cheerful and affectionate to not even wanting to be touched or held. I was irritable and snippy with my bf. Had 0 sex drive and tmi, couldn't even get wet (in my early 20's!) \n\nAfter a couple months I went back to the Dr and was told them it was affecting me in a way I've never experienced. They changed me to a different pill and within a week I felt better. I wanted to cuddle, have sex and spend time with my bf again. It's crazy what hormones can do.. I think I've been on 4 different types of the pill over the years and only that one specific one made me feel that way.\n\nI'm happy things are going well for you and her mood was able to turn around! Good for both of you!",
            "I often wonder if my iUD has impacted me negatively mentally and this is one of those posts that make me question it more and more. I'm so glad things have turned out better for you two.",
            "This happened to me with the mirena. I had it removed and my mood swings improved INSTANTLY. hormonal birth control can be good but for some it can really mess you up. Glad she is doing better!!!",
            "I seriously struggled with moods while on the pill. Doctors never took me seriously until I found a female doctor who believed me because she'd been through the same thing. This is going back 10 years now, it's a lot more recognized now than it was then. Looking back it scares me how different I felt all because of one stupid little pill",
            "If it was the Bayer company coil, then you just got saved. That coil has caused a lot of suffering to women. A documentary about the coil is an eye opener \" the bleeding edge\".",
            "I have been going through almost this exact same thing. I've been off my birth control for about a month now and it's amazing how level headed I feel now. Even when life sucks I feel like I'm able to get back to \"normal\" much quicker now. \n\nThe nurses kept telling me that this wasn't going to be a quick fix and that there were lots of factors contributing to my weight gain and mood swings. They are absolutely right, I won't deny that there could be a million other reasons why everything got better all of a sudden. I also can't deny however, how much pressure and how many side effects I've lived with just so I wouldn't get pregnant. I just want to find what normal is for me and thankfully I'm in a good position in life and in my relationship to do that :)",
            "Birth control is the mutherfucking devil. Have her look into the fertility awareness method!! You go off your base body temperature and cervical fluid to determine precisely what 4 days of the month you are fertile. Because amazingly women are only fertile 12 hours out of the month!! Fertile cervical fluid however can keep sperm alive for up to 2 days tho, so you block out 4 just to be safe and on those 4 days you use another method of contraception. The book Taking Charge of Your Fertility will have all the necessary information if anyone is interested in researching further. This is NOT the natural family planning method that says every woman has a 28 day cycle. This is based in biology and understanding the female body. It has truly and deeply changed my life!!!",
            "Thank you for being patient with her. I had a bad experience with mixing birth control and antidepressants, the chemicals I was feeding myself mixed with my shifted hormones resulted in me having a high sex drive to almost none at all. It\u2019s been 4 years since that happened but my partner and I stayed together through all of the same things you seemed to have experienced and we have a beautiful life together now with a lot more going for us as individual people and as a couple. I\u2019ve still got a lower sex drive than I\u2019d like but at least I\u2019m able to stabilise my moods without medication now, so, there\u2019s that.",
            "I\u2019m glad things worked out and that she\u2019s feeling better!\n\nI also recently decided to see my doctor about depression related to my birth control. It took me a looooong time to figure out what was going on, and it was hard to admit I wasn\u2019t feeling 100%. Unfortunately, I\u2019m in a tough spot because my BC is combatting a lot of symptoms of endometriosis and I\u2019ve tried literally every other type of birth control and it\u2019s the only one that doesn\u2019t give me horrible periods and migraines. My partner has been so patient and supportive during this process.\n\nAll this to say, I think I can relate to her. I never resented my partner when I wasn\u2019t feeling my best\u2014in fact, I think it was easier to let my guard down and feel/act horrible because he was a safe space. Does that make sense? This is not to say it\u2019s the right approach, but I think once I realized that my mood affected him so much too, I needed to make some changes to my behavior. I\u2019m working on verbally expressing when I don\u2019t feel well mentally/physically so that he doesn\u2019t assume it\u2019s about him/us. \n\nAnyway, I hope things continue to improve for her and you!",
            "Same here, my Mirena IUD made me suicidal. \n\nMy doctor convinced me this was an almost impossible side-effect. Before putting it in. It's actually not that uncommon (according to official information).\n\nWhen on or going on birth control, please read up on what you are putting in your body. Start with the official leaflet, but don't limit it to that information. Doctors often have and convey their opinion, I've learnt.\n\nKeep in mind that mood disorders often go unnoticed and undiagnosed and that they use healthy females when it comes to concluding side-effects.\n\nIf you are predisposed to having mental problems, medical problems, etc. You might already be at a higher risk. \n\nAdvice: before going on birth control; track your cycle for two months without birth control then track it for two months on birth control. I think the app was called Clue, it allows you to report on your mood.",
            "I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, prescribed antidepressants. Then I had the contraceptive implant removed from my arm, and no longer do I feel depressed. Can't believe for 3 years not one health professional suggested the two might be linked.",
            "I'm currently going through a similar situation with my partner, constantly moody, grumpy and negative and flies off the handle with little to no cause, I'm honestly at my wits end\n\nshe has been conplaining about her periods being irregular and at times its as if it never ends, it could very well be the iud",
            "Yea, my ex became a completely different person. When posts like these come up, I always suggest meds or birth control because it made my relationship miserable. Like who cares that you can cum into your partner relatively risk free if all the feeling, drive, and excitement she used to show that connected you guys is not there.",
            ">I just wanted to point out that it seemed that the cause of my partner's illness was a hormonal imbalance that was exacerbated by her contraceptive coil? I'm unsure of the science behind that but we are certainly doing better. \n\nThis is definitely supported by science. It's actually one of the official side effects, and so is a reduced sex drive. I'm glad you guys are doing so much better!",
            "I got my life back when I got rid of my hormonal implant. I had two suicide attempts whilst on it. The absence of how contraception affects the mental state of women is utterly disgraceful. I'm so, so happy for you both!",
            "This is awesome! Unfortunately birth control in all forms can really fuck with our moods so I\u2019m glad she\u2019s off that coil",
            "I went psycho on the implant I could feel myself changing. I was so cranky and had less than zero interest in sex - like, \"don't even look at me or I'll scream/vomit/cringe\" interest - they said it was normal until my body 'adjusts' at around 9 months after insertion. I got worse and then had anxiety and panic attacks. Finally Doctor removed it (said it was nothing to do with implant). It took nearly 12 months before I was myself again. I cannot take mini pill etc either as my body acts like I'm pregnant, nonstop as in painful breasts and all day morning sickness etc so I don't do birth control at all now.",
            "Birth control is the worst. Not to this extent but my wife (then gf) had very similar experiences (mood swings instead of straight depression) while on the pill. When she got off it was like a switch flipped.",
            "If it was the coil, it was probably the copper causing her symptoms. The copper, non-hormonal, birth control relies on swelling and an immune response to work. Copper is an inflammatory. So it probably caused inflammation systemically rather than centralizing in the uterus. Interesting that this can cause depression or other mental health issues.",
            "That is awesome . Maybe now you can take responsibility for birth control as it's seems her illness was 100% about that.",
            "Right on for posting this ! \ud83d\ude01 \nReading the comments about experiences different women have had with hormone change & mood is mind blowing, and everyone is so different. I was the opposite of the post, as in small IUD worked so well for me (least amount of hormone you can get in a normal contraceptive, because it's localized) .... But I did have a prev. experience when I took mini pill and I broke out in cystic acne, & sex drive was lost to the wind... Before that was on combined for 5 years & was great with that but had to come off cause of migraines... Made me think you know, maybe it's how much of a change it is you're making. Like, do people know that different combined pills have different hormone amounts in them? A senior nurse told me that - wild!",
            "You're not crazy, the pill and the IUD made me absolutely insane. I'm glad she got it removed and I hope you two can find a better solution to family planning.",
            "Im glad this has a happy outcome!! But remember that people start to feel the effects of the medication and feel like they can quit them cause they're \"better\" and fall back into depression. so maybe convince her to keep taking them for a little bit. Hormonal bc can definitely play sooo heavily on depression but that kind of depression that she had doesn't usually just stop.",
            "I used to be on depo...that quarterly shot....and it messed me up bad.  The moment I stopped I felt better.  A lot like your girlfriend did.  Birth control does a lot of weird stuff. I'm glad everything is going better for you both.",
            "I was on the Mirena IUD and was spiraling into a dark place after 6 months. Got it out a month ago and switched to a non hormonal IUD. I feel 100% better now. Sucks that they never warn about the horrendous emotional side effects. When I told the office why I was getting it out they went over all the other reasons why women end up removing it but seemed a little shocked at my reasoning. None the less, never will I place a hormonal birth control in my body. Every one of them exacerbated by clinical depression ten fold.",
            "I know so many people who have gotten super bad depression from birth control. It\u2019s a super common side effect and should be better well known because it can really be deadly. \n\nMy friend never had any sort of mental health issues before, went on birth control, and wanted to die every day. Luckily she figured out the connection in a couple months but if she\u2019d known it was possible when she started taking it she could\u2019ve stopped immediately when she started getting symptoms.",
            "My birth control had a similar effect on me. I felt tired and depressed a lot of the time and had 0 sex drive. I tried a couple different kinds then ultimately decided to stop taking it all together. I feel so much better and although I do still struggle sometimes I don\u2019t take 3-5hr naps every day anymore and my libido has improved so much. My depression and low libido was greatly affecting my relationship and it\u2019s gotten so much better since stopped my birth control. It\u2019s crazy how much of a toll a little pill can have on your life. Glad you were able to push through the bad times. Like you said, things get better.",
            "there is a lot of scientific evidence to back up what she has experienced. I\u2019m glad you guys are doing better and she figured out at least part, if not all, of the cause of her issues. Hormonal imbalance is a nightmare. Good job for sticking by her side through it!",
            "I went off birth control and found out the weekly migraines I had for 10 years went away. I had tried going off it before and didn\u2019t think it was the cause, but what I didn\u2019t realize is it took about 4 months before they started fading away, and haven\u2019t had one since. Really wish I had realized years earlier. I know BC is helpful to some but gosh there has got to be a better way for many...",
            "Personally my medication made me more depressed than anything. They made me gain so much weight and made me super lethargic.\n\nI worked my way off my medication, started exercising, stopped drinking, and now I feel better than I've ever felt before.\n\nI still have episodes obviously, but I feel more in control and smoke for bad anxiety attacks. Smoking has helped alot cause the whole process of grinding/loading a bowl is tedious and helps me get my mind away from the problem and then smoking helps me stay calm.",
            "I\u2019m so glad that things are going better for you guys! As someone who is on a contraceptive and feels similar symptoms, I often wonder how my life would change if I were to be off of them. Thank you for sharing your story as I can relate to your partner and want to take measures to change my moods to make his life better. Enjoy your camping trip!",
            "I feel this so hard. I was feeling completely apathetic toward life. Then I went off birth control. Mostly because I was too apathetic to give a damn. \n\nHoly Moses did the feelings come back hard!\n\nNot feeling quite right? I recommend changing birth control.",
            "Just had a conversation with my daughter about this. We\u2019re pretty sure her old contraceptive caused her anxiety.  Changed her pills and it\u2019s totally better.  Same thing happened to me years ago.",
            "Honestly reading your post from months back it was almost like you were describing me. And I just had the EXACT same experience - just went off my birth control (pill) and I feel a MILLION times better. Sex drive is back, more energy, I feel happier and less anxious. It\u2019s incredible, honestly. I\u2019m so glad your girlfriend found this was the case for her while also sorry it cost her so much time feeling the way she did - it\u2019s awful, I empathize! I can\u2019t tell you how much I appreciated and still appreciate my SO for all he\u2019s put up with so I\u2019m sure your girlfriend has the same feelings towards you, OP. Best wishes going forward!",
            "Ugh, iuds and hormonal contraceptives can seriously screw with some people\u2019s moods. Like, I felt so suicidal on any hormone treatment, and that\u2019s not hyperbole. I\u2019m so glad she\u2019s off them and feeling better! My good wishes and regards for you and your family!",
            "I know and value all the great things birth control can do but also, fuck it, it\u2019s insane how woman ca. Deal with putting their body through the hormone bombardment and other impacts. Just use a condom guys, everyone will be so much better off",

            "I had Nexplanon for a year and it was terrible.  Horrible mood swings, I was angry at the world for no reason, and I had dark, depressing thoughts constantly. It got to the point where I thought it was just me, that no way my birth control could change me like this. I got it out recently and while I don\u2019t feel 100% normal, I feel a better sense of clarity. Before, all of my thoughts were foggy and I was always quick to get angry or sad. The smallest things would make me burst into tears. I didn\u2019t know anyone who went through a similar experience and didn\u2019t have a ob-gyn to ask questions. Getting Nexplanon was probably one of my worst regrets in my life but hey, I couldn\u2019t have known how bad it was until I tried it myself. I\u2019ll stick to the combo pill for now.",
            "I am so happy you stood by her this whole time. \nWhen my husband and I got married, I got off BC becuase we wanted kids in the near furture and I was tired of BC side effects that were affecting our sex life. \nI spiraled into a depression after getting off of 5 years of BC. \nContraceptives can really mess with everything in the body. \nKeep in mind, if she's had depression once, she could have it again in the future. \nI wish the best for you guys!",

            "What kind of coil was it? The use of the word coil makes me think it was paraguard.",
            "So, just a question: was this a progesterone coil or a copper coil with no hormones?",
            "Nice !\nFucking hormones though... -_-",
            "I felt almost enraged when I started taking the pill and have never taken it again. It can absolutely affect your mood. I don't think you are bragging at all, it's really kind of you to update people as often people only hear about the bad stuff in relationships.",

            "First pill I was ever put in made me cry all the time!\n\nPlanning on getting my mirena (iud) out early next year (to try for a baby) and trally interested to see if it will change my moods and/or libido - it'll be my first time without hormonal interference in 10 years (have had injection, implant, pill and mirena coil).",
            "This is terrifying because the exact same thing happened to me. I was on the pill for a year and that entire time I was struggling with depression. I never connected the pill to this.\n\nLast December I decided to go off the pill and get an implant. It was like a light switched back on and I felt back to my normal self (as in pre-depression me) within weeks.\n\nThere really needs to be more awareness about how drastically birth control can change your mood. I never once thought that it might be the pill causing all of my troubles.",
            "Unfortunately birth control can really fuck women up. I struggle with depression already and when I'm on birth control it turns me into a raving lunatic. I'm aggressive, violent, cruel, fly off the handle over tiny things. Nothing like me in real life. I try to drop hints to my partner to about getting a vasectomy but he doesn't seem too gung ho about it. Maybe one day. For now, condoms are the way to go.",
            "I'm glad you are both doing better and also they need to do more research into the side effects of the various forms of birth control.",
            "I presume it was one of the hormonal coils and not the copper coil?",

            "I'm so happy for you!!!",
            "Honestly contraception can mess with your mental health soooo badly. I am already prone to anxiety/ depression, and was also going through the most stressful period of my life so far when this happened but I was on the pill and I went into a spiral and was worse than I had ever been before. I didn\u2019t even want to leave the house etc. \nI came off it and realised quite how badly it affected it! There\u2019s definitely not enough research into that sort of thing and it\u2019s just accepted as a side effect. \nAnyway, so glad things are looking up for you and your family OP!!",
            "While on the contraceptive patch, i was horribly depressed and anxious. My hair fell out as well. I had a period for 6 weeks. Never again! No hormonal contraceptives for me!",
            "I've heard many similar stories (RE depression linked to hormone medication).\nI would like you and her to do a post mortem on that  depression episode, the reason being that she (nor you) is immune to have it again in the future. It could be in a year, in ten, or never, but you should create a plan of action to prepare to cope if it does. And enjoy every minute  your newfound happiness:it is so, so precious!",
            "Yes, there's 2 types of contraceptive coils. One is just made of copper and the other has hormones. Hormones in contraception works for some. I suffered depression, had serious mood swings. You name it. Hormonal contraception is the devil! That's really good you've noticed the difference and she'll feel better in herself. I'm glad for you both \ud83d\ude0a",
            "Oh yes this was me. The moment they removed my mirena it\u2019s like Jekyll and Hyde. I suddenly felt human again. My doctors all said that it\u2019s impossible for me to get depressed because of the low output of hormones but for me it was a huuuuge difference.",
            "Fair. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a conspiracy, just the dismissive attitude of some health practitioners . I was having genuine problems, they disregarded them and then gave me guilt trips for removing it. I spoke to another practitioner and it turns out they didn\u2019t do proper checks, or insertions and it sounded like I had an infection plus hormone reaction.  First GP was telling f me it was my laundry powder ffs. Problems went away when I finally removed it. Everyone reacts differently. I really wanted to like mine as so many people raved about theirs.",
            "Dude, contraceptives can take a toll on people. I was on hormonal birth control for 8 or 9 years, and once I stopped it, most of my anxiety problems completely went away, and a lot of my mood problems did, too.",
            "This post gives me hope. I've been feeling incredibly awful and only after noticing my acne flare up did I put two and two together and realize it's probably my IUD...\n\nHaving a non hormonal one put in Wednesday, hoping this brings me back to some kind of normal.",
            "That's amazing! One of my best friends also got into major depression because of her contraception. I'm so happy that your partner is in a better place now and I really wish that the world would work on more medication and contraceptives without the hormonal imbalance",
            "Fuck, birth control is a fickle thing! I spent a year miserable on the pill and and as soon as I changed to an implant the better moods were obvious immediately! Glad to hear it's going well now!",
            "My depression greatly worsened with the hormonal contraceptive coil (IUD). The hormonal IUD continuously releases progestin which is similar to progesterone, the hormone that starts periods. This is also the hormone that causes PMS symptoms. In women who suffer from pre-menstrual depressive disorder (PMDD), the hormonal IUD can basically just cause depression for the duration of it being in you. :(",
            "Cutting out the contraceptive is top way to get healthier from my experience!",
            "This is easy science. Many practitioners of cupping therapy or Hijama knows this. When the body is made to withhold stuff that should be secreted out, then it can cause problems, especially in the case of women."

I took the advice and decided to take it slow and just not spill my feelings but the idea of spending time with her without telling her my feelings felt terrible. I was pretty miserable for two days and she ended up asking me why I looked awfully sad and if she could do anything to fix my mood. \n\nI spilled all my feelings for her, it was probably the most unromantic confession ever. She was really surprised that I was into her. We spend the whole night talking. She told me she had been crushing on me for ever since we moved in. She said she never though someone as sweet as me could fall for a 'callous inconsiderate B' like her. \n\nI have never heard Bullshit like that before, she is a bit cold and she doesn't smile a lot but that doesn't make her callous or inconsiderate. She has done a million things for me since we have moved in. I think we both realize that we could have been together way earlier if it wasn't for our fucked up self perception issues. We mostly joked about going to therapy and shit we went through growing up. She is fucked up too but in a way different way than I am. lol. On a serious note, we are both planning on going to therapy. We could have been together for so many months! but we both thought the other would never both with the other. wtf.

        "selftext": "Almost all the marriages in my family have been arranged marriages. My mum\u2019s marriage to my bio dad was an arranged marriage but it ended up in a messy divorce and him completely abandoning us before I was even born. My mum had a love marriage the second time, despite the disapproval of her family, and has been much happier with my stepdad than she probably would have ever been with my bio dad. Because of this, my mum has always been very adamant that she would not try to force us (my siblings and I) into arranged marriages despite what the rest of our family thought.\n\nI\u2019ve been with my fianc\u00e9 (26M) for 3 years now, we got engaged 2 months ago. He\u2019s met my parents and siblings but as far as the majority of my extended family were concerned, I was single until 2 months ago. Early last year, my fianc\u00e9 dropped me off home after work one day and my uncle was there. My uncle is the oldest sibling my mum has so he\u2019s seen as the \u2018head\u2019 of the family (i.e. he thinks he has a say in what the rest of us do). It was obvious my uncle was pissed, and he ended up grilling my fianc\u00e9 and I assume he met his standards (a lot of arranged marriages are about what both families can gain from one another (e.g. wealth, influence, etc.)) so he told my mum to get us married quickly (he wanted to make it look like we had an arranged marriage before the rest of our family found out). My mum ignored him and told us to keep dating if it\u2019s what we wanted. Over the past year, he\u2019s mentioned me getting married to my mum every single time he\u2019s spoken to her.\n\nApparently, my uncle assumed just because he\u2019d given the \u2018order\u2019 that we were going to get married soon. He told my cousin (his daughter) that I had agreed to an arranged marriage and because I had and she was older, she should agree to the match he\u2019d found her. My cousin never mentioned this to me, but she did agree to marry the man my uncle found for her. They got married late last year. They haven\u2019t had a good marriage and my cousin is very unhappy. Her husband is incredibly controlling and hardly ever lets her go anywhere without him or a member of his family.\n\nLast week, she was over at my house when my fianc\u00e9 came over to drop some of the clothes I\u2019d left at his place over. When I told my family about my engagement, they all assumed it was an arranged marriage and I didn\u2019t bother clarifying because it really isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s business. You don\u2019t tend to do sleepovers if you\u2019re having an arranged marriage, so my cousin knew immediately it wasn\u2019t what she assumed. She started asking me questions about my relationship and I answered honestly. She got really angry at me and kept demanding to know why I didn\u2019t tell her about him. The thing is, I\u2019m very close to this cousin but I also know how our family is about dating and I didn\u2019t want my male cousins trying to strongarm my fianc\u00e9 (they\u2019ve jokingly threatened this before). She pretty much blamed me for her arranged marriage and said she only agreed because she thought I was going to have one too and if I had told her I had a boyfriend, she would have had the courage to stand up to her family. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me since.\n\nI do feel bad for her. I know how unhappy she is but if she had mentioned what my uncle told her earlier, I would have clarified. I don\u2019t want this to be the end of our relationship, but I don\u2019t know what I can do to fix this. Please help.\n\nTL;DR \u2013 My cousin agreed to an arranged marriage because she thought I was also going to have one. She\u2019s since realised I\u2019m having a love marriage and is blaming me for letting her agree to an arranged marriage when I had no intentions of having one myself.",

            "I agree with the others that this isn\u2019t your fault and that if your going along with an arranged marriage was such a big factor in her decision to do the same, she probably should have talked to you about it so you would have an opportunity to clear things up. However, this isn\u2019t a problem that you can debate your way out of, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to focus on trying to convince her that you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. My advice would be to tell her that you\u2019re sorry for the misunderstanding and that if you had known that it was being used to pressure her, you would have taken her side, and let her know that whatever she decides to do going forward, you\u2019ll be there to provide support in any way you can. I think that\u2019s all you can do, and once you\u2019ve put that out there, unless/until she reaches out to you and wants to mend fences, I would try and stay out of it.",
            "This is in no way your fault. Your uncle is domineering and duplicitous. This is his fault. The problem with having parents like this is they take any resistance as a challenge to power. It is usually shut down harshly. Your cousin probably has no method of dealing with and all of that icky feeling is being directed at the only person she's allowed to be honest with, you.",
            "As the seemingly only person in this situation not trying to control her or force her into an arranged marriage, you're safe to lash out at. You won't be upset or angry with her for not wanting an arranged marriage. She can be open with her feelings towards you. \n\n\"Priya, I don't think I will ever fully understand your feelings related to your arranged marriage because I simply cannot live in your shoes, but I do want to be there for you and help you navigate this. Please let me know if you want to talk.\"",
            "She is projecting how she feels about herself onto you.\n\nWhile she can't use you as a model, she can certainly use your mother.\n\nTell her you and your family will be there for her if she decides to end her marriage and do something else. If she comes after you again, be kind but firm. She is responsible for her own choices, and she doesn't get to attack you because she wishes she had made the decisions you have.",
            "I like, like most people here, don't come from a culture with a significant arranged marriage tradition, but to me, it doesn't sound like this is on you. Yes, if you'd made a big thing out of how your marriage wasn't arranged, it would have put her in a better spot. But, I'm guessing you're under considerable social sanction not to do that, same as she was under pressure to get an arranged marriage.  \n\n\nThis isn't your fault, but she's in a position where she can't strike out at the primary people responsible for her misery, her shitty husband & father, so try not to be too hard on her about it & help her get out if at all possible.",
            "It\u2019s not you she\u2019s REALLY mad at - it\u2019s her dad/your uncle. He withheld and twisted the truth about your engagement, in order to manipulate her into doing something she wasn\u2019t sure was the right thing for her. He did this because he knew that she trusts your judgment and would think, \u201cif OP is doing it and is happy with her choice, then it must be a good choice for me too.\u201d He knew that she would find out the truth from you eventually, but he chose to lie anyway, banking on the fact that you would keep the detailed history of your relationship private until after her wedding. Who even knows what lengths he went to and what other lies he told to keep you and her from ever discussing it until now - I wouldn\u2019t put it past him.\n\nYour cousin is right to feel like she was tricked and betrayed - but it wasn\u2019t you who tricked her. You did nothing wrong! Her dad is the bad guy here. (Of course, I know he\u2019s operating within a larger cultural context that influenced his behavior, and he genuinely believes that the arranged marriage was the best thing for your cousin - but, at the end of the day, he lied to his child in order to manipulate her into entering an unhappy marriage that she didn\u2019t want, wasn\u2019t ready for, and which isn\u2019t working out. That\u2019s bad parenting, full stop, no matter what culture you\u2019re in.)\n\nNow, depending on how her dad raised her and how close she is with him, it may be very hard for her to recognize and accept all of this. She may still be in the FOG. It may not happen immediately, and she may push back against it. While it may take her a while to recognize that you aren\u2019t the bad guy, I do think you should keep that line of communication open, so that she knows she can always come to you if/when she needs someone. Then, even if it takes a while for her to come around, she\u2019ll always know she has other options.\n\nI would first tell her that you never knew that her dad was lying to her, and that you would have told her the truth immediately if you did know, and would never have helped him lie. I\u2019d also say that you think what her dad did was awful, and you\u2019re sorry that he used your engagement to manipulate her (\u201csorry\u201d as in you feel sympathy for her pain, not as in pretending that you did something wrong). Then, I\u2019d focus on providing her with emotional support for now, both in dealing with this conflict with her dad, and with her ongoing problems with her marriage/husband. \n\nI also think you should let her know that while you aren\u2019t going to pressure her to do anything, if she ever decides that she wants to get divorced, you WILL help her do it without judgment. Tell her that whether she stays in this marriage or not, you will stay in her life and love her forever, no matter what. I\u2019m guessing the rest of the family want her to stay married, and clearly her dad is willing to lie to make her do what he wants - so I think it\u2019s important for her to know that you won\u2019t pressure her one way or the other, and that your relationship isn\u2019t contingent on her doing what you want her to do.\n\nWhen she\u2019s had some time to cool off, and to recognize/accept that her dad is the villain here and not you - then I am certain she will appreciate knowing that she has at least one family member who is honest, loves her unconditionally, will support whatever makes her happy, and will not pressure her to do things she isn\u2019t comfortable with. I\u2019m sure that her dad isn\u2019t providing any of those things, and she might feel like the whole family agrees with him. I hope she realizes you aren\u2019t in the wrong soon - but if not, I think you should leave it to where she knows you care and are there for her, even if she\u2019s angry. I know it\u2019s tough to have her upset at you, and I\u2019m sorry your uncle has put you in this position.\n\nFinally: I\u2019m sure that your mom and stepdad would be willing to support/help your cousin without judgment as well. They can also  serve as role models if she wants to leave her marriage - your mom\u2019s story proves that a woman in your culture can find happiness after divorce, and both of them can attest that marrying for love can lead to happiness and contentment, even if family members disapprove. So if your cousin rejects you now, then you might ask your mom to reach out to her.",

            "Speaking as someone who comes from a similar culture of arranged marriages, I feel for your cousin. Women are expected to be the ones to \"adjust\" in the relationship going ahead and I highly doubt that she had any support in her parents (and presumably your other cousins who're clearly perpetuating the patriarchy). Having some form of parental support (as in your case) makes it far easier to make choices which buck the trend. \n\nThat said, is it your fault that she got into an arranged marriage? Not at all - that's her uncle and husband. In the same way, there's nothing you can do to fix it. You can just offer your cousin support and remind her that your mother managed to get a divorce when it was probably taboo to do so! Be there for her and offer her a place to escape to eventually. I'd say that she get a divorce if she's unhappy (because that controlling behaviour is only going to escalate and bringing children into that is a shit idea), but that's her choice eventually. You can bring a horse to the water but not make it drink and all that jazz.",

Luckily my situation is good, nothing was forced on me, I got to know her well before I said yes and it was upto me totally. No family pressure. Thing is, with your cousin, she had family pressure. I have other cousins who got love-married, so that precedence scared some of my family members, some uncle's were like \" ohh he's gonna set a precedent for our kids and they'll want the same and won't listen to us and we won't be able to do much\" etc. That's the scare here.  So in her eyes, you could've been a \"precedence\" for her, so she might be mad that you didn't tell her because if she had known, maybe she would've never agreed to the marriage at all. She's angry right now, so let her be. Just tell her your there for her, and if her marriage really is so bad, tell her you'll stick up for her (I know there's only so much you'll be able to do with all the family politics) but tell her to trust you and you be the best cousin she's got.",

You didn\u2019t want to tell the rest of your family because it wasn\u2019t worth it and I understand that, but if you\u2019re that close to her, you should have told her. Or at least, I think that\u2019s how she sees it.

She can **still** stand up to them and get a divorce if she's that unhappy.\n\nArranged marriages need to die out swiftly in societies. These type of societies condemn premarital sex but are totally fine having their children marry a complete stranger. Like wtf",
            "Right now it is just an easy option to blame you because of her lack of courage and confidence to standup for herself and say no of her own accord. I don\u2019t think she is upset at you, I think she is upset at herself and uncle but you are probably the easier punching bag she can unleash her hurt feelings on. Even if you told her about your fianc\u00e9 and that you weren\u2019t having an arranged marriage that still may not have changed anything for her.

I'd try to reach out and tell her that she can vent to you and you want to help her. \n\nI'm not you but if you want to know what I would do in your situation is say you'd let her stay with you and your fiance so she can divorce her husband. Do not feel like you have to, because you really really don't. But if it is something you could do, I think she'd really appriciate that.

If she had done just about anything beyond just agreeing to the decision she could've found out that you weren't in an arranged marriage.  Her choices and lack of investigation led her to this point, not your relationship.",

She\u2019s guilting you for something her lack of personal responsibility and lack of courage caused. \n\nIt\u2019s clear you\u2019re sympathetic toward the oppression she lives under with your uncle being a domineering and controlling father and patriarch of the whole family at large. Your sympathy shouldn\u2019t lead you to feel responsible for her lack of courage. She\u2019s an adult. She can make the *difficult* and *uncomfortable* choice of standing up for herself\u2014at least communicate her wants with you and/or other family members. Or, she can do what she did by cowering and silently submit to her domineering father and the marriage situation he demanded. \n\nIt\u2019s never to late for her to turn it around and stand up for herself. Your mom divorced. Why can\u2019t your cousin?\n\nReally, it has to be emphasized that she\u2019s blaming you for her own ineffectiveness (e.g., not braving the act of communication, cowering to her dad and blaming *you* instead of her dad, acting entitled to pity when she didn\u2019t do the minimum of speaking up to you if no one else in your family).

Leave her be in silence and let her sulk about her own life choice as this is not your problem to fix.

And that what she really needs to do is have a divorce if she is unhappy in her marriage and there's no fixing it, and blame either herself, or her parents (if they coerced her into the marriage) but that you were not and are not responsible for her life decisions, and she can either drop the matter or she needs to leave you alone about it until she's ready to apologise to you and own her mistakes.",

            "My husband is kind of going through something like this with his brother right now. He is the younger brother and we met through friends, dated and lived together for years before getting engaged. His brother was pressured by family a lot once we got married, and ended up being rushed into marrying the girl he had been dating. It wasn\u2019t arranged per se but it was definitely a case of her parents spoke to his parents and tada, now you\u2019re engaged! And then they both kind of caved to the pressure. Both families really pushed a narrative that because they worked well on paper (both Indian, both educated, both from similar social strata) love would grow after marriage. Anyway they got married in February this year and were talking about divorce by April. It\u2019s still dragging out now and they haven\u2019t spent more than a few days together since the wedding. Both have a lot of anger and resentment towards their families and each other.\n\nMy BIL is angry with his parents but not with my husband because he\u2019s been the only one in the family to just listen and not push any agenda. He took my husband\u2019s advice to get into therapy and feels that\u2019s been helping. I agree with other posters that your cousin is lashing out at you because she feels safe. It\u2019s likely she has a lot of anger towards her father, but clearly he has too much power over her for her to really face that right now. It sounds like she just feels very hurt and betrayed by everyone. I feel for her, but it\u2019s not your fault.\n\nAll you can do is tell her you\u2019re there for her, and be someone for her to confide in. Women trying to leave bad marriages to abusive people are vulnerable, and even though it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s important you be there for her. Whether she leaves this guy or stays with him, she\u2019s in a precarious position now, and she needs someone in her corner. Don\u2019t let her be an asshole to you but don\u2019t abandon her either.",
            "It\u2019s not your fault. This is happening because she knows she wants to leave but is at the stage of wishing she could go back and undo this rather than facing what she needs to do because it\u2019s hard and means accepting her dad lied to her and it was her dad (and her own fear of going against him) that got her here.\n\nThere isn\u2019t anything you can do except be sorry for her that she\u2019s in this position and wish her all the best / support her if she wants to try and get away (if you\u2019re in a position to help).",

Sounds like it wasn't that kind of trusting relationshio in the first place so she can't blame you. I am pretty sure her husband doesn't want her talking to you or anyone with nontraditional ideas so she's just trying to make you feel guilty. I doubt he'll let her out at all soon as she's had children. It's between him and her and nothing to do with you. Once you're married, she may try to involve you in her attempts to get away and she's guilt tripping you in advance. Judging by her husband, it could turn out dangerous.",

            "Okay here are the things I noticed here:\n\n1. The whole partiachial thing with your uncle being the *head* and decision maker is completely bollocks. I assume you're from south asia because that's where these kind of family dynamics are accepted. \n2. Also hatred towards *love marriage* is toxic. South Asian society should understand marriage is between two people, not family. I have witnessed how people from arranged marriages got their marriage destroyed and their families either do nothing about it or make it even worse. In most cases, women get the worse hit. So I do not go along that line. \n3. I don't see why your cousin should blame you for her marriage to fail unless you meddled with her marriage. If there's anyone to blame it's your uncle aka her father because he's the one who rushed her into marriage as it was *their duty*. I know how Asian parents think there's nothing worse than a woman remaining unmarried after 25. The problem here is that they think marriage is a necessity when actually it's a choice. People tells me you'll be alone in your old age if you're not married. Well, I have a grandmother who was married and she's all alone in her home because her husband passed away. You'll always be alone in your old age no matter if you're married or not. That's how life works. So she needs to point her finger to her father who probably arranged the marriage without checking what kind of man his daughter is going to live with. \n4. Even if your cousin had a love marriage it still can fail and she has no right to blame you. She is using her frustration on you because in her eyes, you are happy and have freedom to chose a guy of your liking. She must be having angst that she could have a better guy, as I said her father chose a guy without looking further into it.\n\nI would say avoid her for sometime and when she calm down, you can sympathize with her and show that you care for her because she probably gone through a lot from her marriage failure. She needs all the support she needs. I mean you know that as you have seen how your own mother went through. And have a talk with your uncle and tell him he ruined his daughter's life, if possible.",
            "Wow. This entire story is a lesson in why arranged marriage is a bad thing. There's nothing wrong with recommending a partner for your son or daughter, but expecting someone other than them to make the decision about marriage leads to unhappiness and resentment, as we see here. Props to your mom for realising this and not subjecting you to the same. Hopefully your cousin calms down and can find the strength to leave her current awful husband, to find someone who will treat her well. It may be she's just irrationally lashing out due to her own pent up feelings. Hope you can resolve this.",
            "She got married to someone she didn't know and now it's causing issues.\n\nA friend of mine when I was in the military came from a traditional Indian family.  They set up things like family mixers before \u201dannouncing\u201d the marriage.  If the bride and groom don't like each other it became a party.  \n\nHi family had these parties for a year before find someone he liked and she liked him.  They still felt like they arrange it but th couple got a little say. \n\nI thought this was how arrange marriages were working in modern times.",
            "What a Godless mess. Humans like this uncle are evil and worthless, they are folk that destroy lives before they have even been lived. It isn't the way to be a human being. This dynamic does not speak positively to me at all about this \"traditional\" culture where he learned his ways and means.\n\nLove has to come first in life, without that what do we have on our deathbeds? Silly fool uncle will only have unending hell when he is dying, for putting power and cultural/family politics before love. End of little rant.\n\nWish I had advice, but what is done is done. I'd just say that cousin needs to find a way to escape and hopefully then the two can reconcile...while OP reduces contact with all these foolish and wicked \"traditional family folk\" to a bare minimum (well, at least the ones that support and make nice with uncle..they are cowards)",
            "OP, you have to tell your cousin that her dad knew and lied to her about it. And that when she tells him, he\u2019ll most likely still lie to her. \n\nIt\u2019ll be difficult, but for the sake of both your and your cousin\u2019s happiness, y\u2019all have got to stand up to your uncle and families.",
            "A little bit of a tangent here: do your cousin and your mum have a good relationship? I bet your mum could help your cousin get the courage to leave her husband if that's what she wants to do.

            "So just curious here but couldn't the cousin also get a divorce at this point? She is unhappy and angry at being in an arranged marriage. She could take the steps like OPs aunt did to divorce and find a love match. She did say had she known, she would have stood up to her father about it all so it really isn't too late. The cousin was lied to and manipulated into the marriage in the first place sssoooooo\nLike another person said it doesn't seem the family is too strict about divorce and such since OPs mother got one and the family still speak with her. I think this would be the next logical step in this whole mess. I feel bad for OPs cousin and I hope she can choose the next steps she takes to create a happier life for herself.",
            "What country are you in India? \nBecause if this is not in India then I\u2019m sure your cousin can get out of the marriage easily. Also I understand the pressures of marriage and it\u2019s not your fault you wanted to keep your relationship under wraps. So don\u2019t worry",
            "It's in no way at all, not even in the slightest, your fault.  She needs to blame the right person.

            "As an Indian, this sounds very Indian to me. Or at least south Asian.\n\nThis is messy because she is obviously very unhappy with everything going on and is trying to find an outlet for all the unhappiness.

If he is so domineering to you when you aren't even his daughter, I can only imagine what it must be like for his daughter. \n\nYou should have a conversation with your cousin. Even though you owe her no explanation, maybe do explain what happened with the uncle in detail? Try to make her understand how her anger is misplaced. And you should also understand how trapped she must be feeling. She has nowhere to go, does she? She must have been raised in an orthodox environment, tricked into marrying her father's choice, and stuck in a possibly loveless marriage. I would be blaming the whole world too if I was her.",
            "Aww man, I feel for you and the cousin. I understand why you chose to keep it a secret, protect your space and energy at all cost. If you\u2019re both close and you both keep secrets - that\u2019s not a good sign. She\u2019s right though, that if you\u2019d opened up she probably would have had the confidence and courage to strut her own part, she can feel bad about that but she can\u2019t blame you for protecting yourself. Give her some time, she\u2019s still hurt. But also, think about why she\u2019s hurt, there\u2019s probably other girls in your family who will benefit from hearing the truth about your relationship, they too may find the confidence and courage to stand up for themselves. Loyalty and honesty are the bedrock of healthy strong bonds. You gotta look out for the girls in your family sis, even if it comes as a personal cost.",

            "I'm so sorry. This is hard. I'm sorry your cousin is blaming you for her decisions. You are not to blame here, not in the slightest. Please stop questioning yourself. You are in a crazy situation - don't let it dupe you into thinking \\*you're\\* the crazy one.  \n\n\nMaybe write your cousin a note to tell her you love and support her. In person, whisper in her ear about your mother's divorce and second marriage. Remind her it is always a decision to stay or leave, and if she had the courage to stand up to her father before, she has it now. It's possible she could even annul that first marriage (i.e. get it erased from records).",
            "She's being abused and looking for way comfort herself or have some control of the situation she's been manipulated into. blaming you is the safer option rater than the men who manipulated and could hurt her.\n\nI would guess the Uncle turning up that first time wasn't a coincidence, either he had started mentioning marriage to your cousin or had already scouted out the family he wanted her to marry and she was resisting. He need you to \u2019accept\u2019 and get married probably because you where part of what was giving her the confidence to keep saying no to him. She might admire and respect you and your Mother more than you realise so in her eyes this \u2019betrayal\u2019 hit hard.\n\nGently remind her you had no part of and no knowledge of your Uncles deception. If you are close then offer her your support as she might well be feeling betrayed, trapped, alone and without options.\n\nYour mother managed to get out with a child is in tow and manages to ignore and defy your Uncle, so it's possible with help she can too.

He tries to gaslight and manipulate me and I'm not taking his shit anymore. He is absolutely in love with her and I hope one day he can come to terms with his feelings just leave me the fuck alone. I'm not a sidepiece or seat filler.

            "Way to stand up for yourself!! When I was 22 I would have let this drag on for another 2 years. Good on you!",
            "That'll be very funny is that \"marriage material\" best girlfriend keeps him a friend forever and not boyfriend/husband  - Either way, no longer your problem nor situation. Hope you find a new man that wants to be with  you for you, not as placeholder nor a substitute.",
            "Good on you choosing yourself",
            "As a boyfriend, you don't ever say your best friend is \"marriage material\" to anyone, much less your fricken girlfriend. He probably liked having her as a side option like a \"just in case\" kind of deal. \n\nNone of that is acceptable in a relationship and I'm glad you got OUT! I'm glad you're respecting yourself the way he should have.",
            "Good for you!  You deserve happiness and to be the one for someone.",
            "Cue incoming post on 2XC from the best friend commiserating about how her so-called \"best friend\" blew up on her before her wedding to reveal that he was only her friend all this time because he was expecting to date her in the future. \n\nOP, your boyfriend's attitude was super unhealthy. If you're comfortable with her, you might give her the heads up. She may or may not believe you, but at least you tried.",
            "Does she know he considers her marriage material?  She's 20, she's probably ready to go off to college and get on with her life not be mom to his future kids.",
            "Good! Don't be any dudes plan b",
            "Lol \u201cmarriage material\u201d yet he can\u2019t even commit to his own girlfriend. You deserve and will do much better than him.",
            "I hell yes girl, free yourself up to find a real man who respects the relationship and you.",
            "He doesn\u2019t sound like boyfriend material let alone marriage material. Glad you ran away from the crazy town!",
            "yay! i hope you blocked him",
            "just want to say i had a similar situation when i was younger. bf had a best gf who he previously dated before me. they all went to highschool together. they always hung out in a big group w a bunch of guys and always excluded me if she was there. i was only allowed to come if its just me and him or him and just a couple of his guy friends. He would always say its a guys night but i would find out that she was there too like she is one of the guys. but i just. knew that something didnt feel right.  your gut feelings are usually right. He ended up marrying her and what am i supposed to make of the time i spent w him as a gf. i felt v disrespected and used. good riddance girl you deserve better. those kind of selfish people have their karma coming back to bite them.",
            "Good for you for getting free of this immature and manipulative child. Do not let him dictate where you spend your time. If you want to hang out with that group- go for it. His discomfort is his own problem, not you or anyone else\u2019s.",

            "Good for you!!! Find someone for who YOU are their dream girl!",
            "You have your shit together lady! You\u2019re going places, congratulations. I hope you find someone who appreciates you fully :)",
            "He is most likely aware of his feelings, he just gaslighting you.",
            "Good for you. A lot of men our age are so unbelievably out of touch. He probably won't change anytime soon, I'm glad you stuck up for yourself.",
            "Why on earth are so many young Americans obsessed with getting married,...at bloody 20??!! I never realised how overall obsessed with marriage, children and religion Americans are until I joined Reddit.",
            "Good for you! Thumbs up!",
            "First off, we're all proud of you for knowing your worth.  Go do all the things that you wanted to do, but didn't, because you were his girlfriend.",
            "Curious for yet another update, to see if the bestie dumps her boyfriend or vice versa. Good for you, OP.",
            "I didn\u2019t see your first post but so glad you dumped that guy! My best friend is a guy and I can\u2019t imagine in a million years either of us describing each other as \u201cmarriage material\u201d how weird and gross of your ex to do that!! Good for you knowing your worth!!",
            "Congrats on choosing yourself, I don't think many of us could have done the same at your age!",
            "huge red flag. props to you for leaving, karma will do him justice, it will come i promise. in the meantime, find someone better.",
            "I\u2019m proud of you, change is difficult. You will grow and learn from this.",
            "Congrats. It will suck for a bit at first but you are way better off!!! You are nobodies backup plan or seat filler",
            "You\u2019re awesome! That is a very weird dynamic, for sure, and I love that you were able to get out of this situation without years of drama. You knew what you had to do and you did it! Good for you!!",
            "Good on you for standing up for yourself. You deserve respect, and your BF was disrespectful and abusive. Strength and healing to you.",
            "It\u2019s so satisfying to see that he got dumped and this \u201cmarriage material best friend\u201d will probably never see him as anything more than a close friend. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he actually makes her uncomfortable, especially if she knew he was just keeping her around bc he\u2019s interested in her. If she wanted to be with him, she would\u2019ve done it by now. Good riddance!",
            "Good on you for doing what's best for yourself",
            "Super proud of you for dumping him!!! Congratulations \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Nobody aged 21 is 'marriage material' lol.\n\nYou're well out of there.",
            "Ew how gross on so many levels. Calling someone marriage material is vile and dehumanizing for one. Bullet dodged IMO.",
            "Bet you that girl and her bf will be broken up real soon",
            "I\u2019m so so deng proud of you, now keep him out of your life",
            "Sounds like classic attachment/abandonment. You are afraid of losing him to this person you feel threatened by.\n\nYou could explore why you have those fears and shared with him what he could do to help you feel secure, but instead it sounds like you blamed him for your fear and let fear control you. \n\nYou have the option to reflect and hold yourself with integrity.",
            "Dumping someone over text when neither distance nor safety are a concern is real mature, but glad you're doing you I guess",
            "[removed]",
            "I\u2019ll put in my experience here. I had a friend who I really clicked with. I was in a relationship, very faithfully I might add. The girlfriend I had, was manipulative. I cared deeply for her. When I met that friend, it was at a party me and said girlfriend threw. The friend was actually a coworker who had just started at the company. So outside of work in a party environment we instantly got along and she was extremely cool. I absolutely love talking with people and having a good joyful good natured time so when she (and her girlfriend) arrived I as the host invited them in, and we instinctively had this awesome handshake that we made up on the spot effortlessly. I the point is, I got along with this person 100% as friends and it was absolutely a great feeling because she was so honest. My (at the time) girlfriend told me the next day, I wasn\u2019t allowed to speak to that person again, because I was \u201cflirting\u201d I listened because I cared deeply for her. I\u2019ll never forgive myself for that. I let that girl down as a friend and I let myself down. I\u2019ve never found someone who felt so real and so quickly to be such a trustworthy cool person. \n\nSo the point is, in my eyes a healthy relationship demands allowing freedom. Telling someone they can\u2019t be friends with someone else because of jealousy, is absolutely unforgivable to me now. It\u2019s selfish.\n\nEdit: if you are in a relationship where you don\u2019t trust the other person, leave."
