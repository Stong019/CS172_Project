        "selftext": "Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5g5f6u/i_23_m_found_my_girlfriends_23f_fake_instagram/)\n\n\nSo I decided to try to talk to my girlfriend casually about the account. \n\n\nI told her that when she was letting me use her phone (I logged her out of Instagram and was going to log into mine so that I could post a photo directly from her phone, and saw the other account as an option) I noticed the other account.\n\n\nShe looked horrified at first, but then without any prompting at all she confessed that she had a super insecure day after exactly the incident I was discussing with other commenters [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5g5f6u/i_23_m_found_my_girlfriends_23f_fake_instagram/dapmmqk/?st=iw8j5cz5&sh=51581fcc)  (so thank you very much for making me introspect, reddit). She ranted to her best friend about how she was feeling, and the two of them made the account. They crept the accounts that accepted the follow requests, her friend helped her boost her ego a bit with some girl talk, and she completely forgot about it. \n\n\nShe said she was having a really hard time when I was depressed, but felt like she couldn\u2019t complain about it because my pain was \u201cworse,\u201d so she just sort of let a whole bunch get to her over time. \n\n\nShe told me that she felt her poor handling of certain things this summer (her words), and the massive insecurity she felt, was an indicator that she probably needed to talk to someone and work through some things, and she\u2019s actually been seeing a therapist every other week or so for the past few months. This wasn't just due to the summer, as she felt she's needed to do this for a while, it was just sort of what motivated her.\n\nThis shocked me, and she apologized for not telling me. She says that she felt like she couldn\u2019t complain to me about her mental health when she knew I was going through so much. And then when I started to get better she didn\u2019t know how to randomly bring it up since some time had past. \n\nI had no idea how hard my depression was on her. I feel so selfish that I didn\u2019t even notice, but she says she completely understands, and she know how preoccupying depression can be. \n\nAll in all, she apologized profusely for the account, deleted it in front of me, and we promised to try to get back to being the good communicators we were before my depression hit. \n\nTL;DR - Talked to her. She was embarrassed, had forgotten about the account, and revealed why she made the account without any prompting. She took trying to support me during my depression harder than I realized, and we're going to try to be better communicators. ",

            "I think your gf has actually been quite mature and handled herself well here... realising her insecurity and then going to see a therapist for help is a really refreshing thing to hear especially on this sub. I think you can apologise for that night and not responding to her because I think she is right to be a bit upset about that since you did respond to these other girls. \n\nAnyway sounds like it's being handled well by both of you so keep it up and maybe be a bit more sensitive to her insecurity since it was sparked off for genuine reasons. I think any of us would feel the same if our partner was texting exes but not replying to us.",
            "OP, I'm glad to hear that you worked things out with each other. I hope you enjoy many joyful decades together. I would warn of the tendency to relapse and that you should both keep each other on a \"feelings watch\" i.e., if either of you feels insecure, to have the courage to speak up to each other FIRST.

            "This conversation is really mature for 23! You may have a keeper here, OP (and her, too)!",
            "This sounds like a pretty model example of how to deal with the situation pleased it worked out for you.",
            "Honestly, I don't even think it's that weird that she has an Instagram account following them.\n\nI social media stalk the exes of any guy I'm seeing/interested in (including ex-hookups, ex-flings...even good female friends who I suspect he's had feelings for).\n\nThis behavior might sound crazy to you, but basically every girl I know does the same thing. (I've actually deleted Facebook before for this reason...it enables me to find out way too much!)\n\nAnd I'm actually not the jealous type AT ALL. Seriously. Neither are the other girls I know who do this. It's something hardwired in our brains, I tell you, haha....we just need to know your past and need to know you like us more than you liked them/we fit better with you than they did. ;)\n\nOne friend of mine said she just likes to look at exes to see what they have in common with her...she thinks it's really interesting.\n\nI could discuss my analysis of why I think women are like this, but I'll hold off for now because at this point I'm just rambling. :)",

I told her if I couldn't stop her, she should at least leave me out of it, i want nothing to do with it.\n\nShe went nuclear, she went and told them everything, and embarrassed the fuck out of herself.

She had a panic attack, she went nuts.  She was like \"what the hell is wrong with you kids?\"  I tried to stay out of it but my sister dragged me into it and named me as her accomplice even though I had warned her against it.  Our mom was so hurt and upset, not only that her daughter would so brazely accuse her of cheating, but that her children had watched an explicit sex tape of her.  She was really traumatized, she couldn't take it any more.\n\nShe got up and left to her parents house where she's been there for a whole day to recuperate.

Your sister had the right intentions but dragging you into it was a dick move.\n\n**EDIT** Because of the hate i'm receiving from this comment, if you found a video of your mom banging some dude you didn't think was your father how would you go about it? Would you let it eat away at you and just never bring it up even though your mother could be cheating on your father? When his parents made that sex tape they knew the risks of someone else watching it if they didn't hide it well, I mean let's be real, they recorded it for their own pleasure. Knowing that, the mother totally over reacted. She feels betrayed that she would think she would cheat on him but it was her and her husbands own damn fault that they didn't hide the video in a place their children couldn't access it. The daughter clearly wasn't thinking straight and it was 100% scummy of her to drag her brother into it when he didn't want anything to do with it but she had the right intentions regardless of what you redditor detectives choose to believe.",

Most of you told me to go through with it but through email/letter basically without physical interaction. Even though it was a massive risk, I thought it would be better for me to explain this shit to him in person so I decided to meet him.\n\n\nI called work explaining I'd be late and then drove over to his workplace around 7:20 am. Then I just went inside and waited in the lobby, watching the door for him to appear. He came in around 8 am and immediately I walked up to him, told him by name I have something important to tell him, and asked if he could meet me after work at a nearby Starbucks. He was perplexed but I convinced him that it's very important and told him not to tell anyone. He agreed, thankfully.\n\n\nSo then I went to my job and went about the day as usual. At 5:30 I was waiting at Starbucks and he came in shortly after. Then the conversation began.\n\n\nI explained to him that what I was gonna say would crush him and I requested a chance to say my piece without interruption. He allowed this so I told him everything. About how I met his wife, how she used a fake name, the 5 month affair, the lengths she went to to conceal it, everything. For my own safety I emphasized how I didn't know she was married, how I found out about her secret, and how I decided to tell him as soon as I found out. I then handed him a folder containing all of the screenshots. He looked through all of it and then just stared at his coffee in total silence for a minute or two.\n\n\nHe then replied, firstly thanking me for coming to him with this information and for doing the right thing. He said if he were in my position he would have done the same thing. Then he told me how he had suspected his wife was cheating but then his wife lied to him, assuring him nothing was going on.\n\n\nThen for the next 10 minutes he asked questions about the affair, like about the dates we went on, the sex (she never did anal with him but did it often with me), the conversations we had, etc. I told him the complete truth. By the end of this he was enraged but didn't attack me or anything. Instead he thanked me once more for telling him, and told me I'm a good man. Then he said that although he appreciates me telling him, he told me never to contact him again for obvious reasons. I totally understood and was cool with it.\n\n\nAt this point he was getting up to leave so I asked him what he plans to do. He said he would definitely divorce her and that the screenshots would help him out since they apparently have an infidelity clause in their prenup (she cheated on him at the early stages of their relationship). I was elated to hear this, wished him the best of luck, and we parted ways. I paid for his coffee.\n\n\nSo there it is. Thankfully I escaped unharmed. No injuries, no wounds, nothing. I deleted the cheating bitch's number and cleared my phone of all traces of this shitstorm. I'm proud of what I did and I pray that the cheating bitch faces harsh justice. \n\n\nGood night, Reddit, hero signing out.\n   \n\ntl;dr: Met up with guy after work, told him everything as per original plan. He thanked me, said he would divorce her, and will use my screenshots as evidence due to the infidelity clause in their prenup. Total win all around.",

        "selftext": "Background: I'm a graduate student, just wrapping up my PhD, living in LA. My fianc\u00e9e and I have been dating for two years, and engaged for three months. She works in corporate strategy at a big company. Neither of us make a lot of money, we live in a tiny 1 BR/BA.\n\nRecently, one of our friends [27F] started selling jewelry and other little handmade trinkets via an online store (Etsy). It's going well, she's selling about one thing a day and making a bit of money on the side.\n\nI'm pretty sure my fianc\u00e9e got envious. She's artsy at heart, and often looked for a side-gig. After our friend started selling crafts, my fianc\u00e9e tried her hand at a number of things -- jewelry, pottery, etc. until she settled on paper flowers.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e has made _thousands_ of paper flowers over the past two months. \n\nShe's been trying to sell them online, and has gotten some success -- selling a few dollars' worth every day. That wasn't enough though, so she's also been selling them at markets, fairs, and plainly on the streets after work. \n\nHowever, the paper flowers don't make much money. Though we're not \"well off\" by any means, she still makes more money at her day job. \n\nBut I've caught her skipping her day job to sell flowers! In the last two weeks, she's actually been taking sick days and \"working from home\" in the mornings, telling her boss she's on calls or stuck in traffic when she's actually spending the first three hours of the day going door-to-door hawking paper flowers.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong. They're nice flowers. She's doing a great job at making them, and her drive is impressive. But I feel as if it's an obsession that's taking over her life, when she should be prioritizing her real work, and frankly, our relationship. We've been less intimate and have had less time for dates and other fun things because she's always working on the paper flowers. The closest we get these days is when I help her bring flower packages to the post office, or when I'm helping her take photos of the flowers. Stuff like that. I feel like I've become an accessory to her side business (which, I repeat, doesn't actually make much money at all). \n\nIt's had impacts in other ways as well. Hanging out with our friends is a struggle now, because my fianc\u00e9e doesn't want to talk about anything but the flowers. She's always carrying some in her purse, showing them off, and if a friend shows only a little bit of interest, my fianc\u00e9e will try to sell them some. It's awkward. \n\nI have no idea what to do. I'm considering taking a break and moving back in with my parents (also in LA) for a few weeks while hoping for her to stabilize. But that seems extreme. What should I do?\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR;** : Fianc\u00e9e is obsessed with her arts-and-crafts side business, which doesn't make a lot of money, but it's totally taking over her life, hurting her other priorities and our relationship.

It sounds like she's feeling unfulfilled in her current job and wants to explore more artistic avenues.\n\nIs there a possibility she could look into a job that fills the lack of creativity she might be feeling? As others have mentioned you should definitely have a conversation with her to see what exactly is driving this.",
            "You're right to be concerned. Having a hobby is one thing, but skipping out on her day job to do this is concerning. Sit her down and ask her what her goal is with this flower business. Remind her that her day job should still be her priority.",
            "I hate the \"you should talk to her\" advice because it's such a cliche, but's honestly, it's a cliche because it's a good starting point. If you haven't talked with her about this and fully explained how it's affecting you and your relationship, that's a great place to start. \n\nAlso, asking her how she's feeling about her flowers vs. her current job; is she not fulfilled in her current role? Is there something she could do in her current role to get more job satisfaction (and potentially spend less time with the flowers)? Is there a different professional path she is looking towards? Understanding her \"why\" for this a little deeper could help you both find a more intentional/specific solution. Good luck!",

Right when we bought the house I started a business that consumed me for 5 years.  I wanted him to embrace it too and help me.  He patiently tolerated my taking over our house with inventory.\n\nIn my mind, I was building an entrepreneurial future for us.   \n\nBut it didn't work out.  I folded the business after 5 years.\n\nbut the damage was done.\n\nWe hadn't connected or taken a trip and barely had sex in those 5 years.\n\nWe eventualy spilt up because we had grown apart and it was really my fault.\n\nI think lack of communication is what killed us.  He never verbalized that he resented my time with the business.\n\nHe never asked me what the long term plan was or asked if I had a business plan. (I didnt.)\n\nI did have to \"get it out of  my system\" to see what running a business was like. So I advise letter her pursue it in some way.  But be open about the impact it's having on your relatioship.  Perhaps a couples counselor would help.\n\nI'd hate for her to be writing on Reddit in 10 years how she threw away a good relationship for a flower business.\n\n(On the other hand, on the off chance that you see this business has potentia and she's onto something big, then you can be patient and ride it out, if it could benefit you both down the road.  That is the life of an entrepreneur.)\n\n&#x200B;",
            "As a corporate strategist, has she done some thinking about how profitable she could be? Does she have some sort of model that explains this? As a management consultant, I would do this to validate my idea with some basic assumptions. Is she being deliberate about this business to strike rich because she knows she can, or is she just doing arts and crafts to one up her friend?\n\nThe answer to that question is important. Ask her to make a model if she hasn't.\n\nOther than that, it seems like you're being supportive and relationships with side hustles can be tough. That being said you have every right to want to spend more time with her and she should recognize this and agree to some sort of compromise. ",

Paper flowers, even the more complicated designs, are insanely cheap and there are plenty of wholesalers already in the market. One woman making them by hand will flat out not be able to compete.",
            "Sit down with her and try to plan out the next five years of the paper flower business. How much does she want to budget and is there a way she can break even/make a profit? What does she see as the longterm goal? Does she want to have paper flower retail stores or do a gallery show of her paper flower work? Does she eventually want to quit her day job? Make it concrete and it might be come clearer to her whether this is something she wants to pursue or just an obsession.",
            "I live in LA too and paper flowers are a huuuuge thing at weddings here.\n\nMaybe she should look into marketing them for weddings? \n\n\nAnyway - this is not sustainable as I am sure you know.

The folks who are able to do just what they love for a living, very rare, and they work HARD and longer hours than any day job, and the financial risks are REAL. \n\nSkipping work for this is not sustainable, and as you said, she's not making much (if any, lets be real here after you account for time spent + materials) profit. It's great that she's found something she's passionate about, but balancing that is tough. Remember that the root for passion in Latin means to suffer/endure, it requires sacrifice in other areas of your life. I would suggest wording your concerns carefully so that she doesn't think you don't support her creative endeavors, but that you miss the time you spend together and you're concerned about her skipping work.",
            "I have several family members who are professional artists. They all have day jobs - except one, who inherited several million dollars. MOST artists and creative people have day jobs. That's just how it is. And you can't imperil your day job to make art, because if you lose a good day job, you may find yourself having to work multiple minimum wage jobs and no longer having TIME.\n\nMaybe link her to Sara Benincasa's essay \"Real Artists Have Day Jobs\" (on Medium).\n\n\"The biggest myth we are fed as artists is that we need to sustain ourselves solely on our art. This is ridiculous. Every artist has at some point in time had some other job. Some of them kept these jobs their entire lives.

Why would they not go for actual flowers or plastic flowers?\n\nI think your fiancee hopes this can turn into a profitable business and she can quit her job but let me be frank the journey is much more difficult. She hasn't even gotten to the part where she files for taxes.",
            "Yeah this was one weird read to be honest. Question Id ask myself is, do you think this will last long? Do you think she can realise that she is chasing some dream that cant really be attained, and can she be bored of doing the same shit with the paper flowers. And how long has this been ongoing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it has not been ongoing for that long, Im sure the excitement will cool down, and you wont actually be the one stopping her. I dont know all the info though, care to further give me details?",

            "It sounds like she wants this to be an actual business, not just a money-making hobby? \n\nI have gone through the experience of having my husband start a business shortly after we married so I can tell you what we did that worked for us;\n- Agree on a specific timeline and profit expectations that would make this worth the time and energy being put in to trying to make it a business, rather than just doing it as a fun side project.\n- Agree on what \u201cwork hours\u201d being put into this business are going to be okay for both of you, and what days/times are reserved for couples time.\n- Set a \u201cstart-up\u201d budget for the business and agreed that once that money ran out, if the business isn\u2019t self-sustaining, no more money will be put into it. It doesn\u2019t sound (?) like this is a current concern of yours, but you could maybe encourage her to do so. I\u2019m sure paper isn\u2019t the most expensive supply, but I can still imagine going down a wormhole of thinking if you just have a better camera, or took photography lessons, or spend more to advertise your products, that\u2019s all the business needs to take off.\n\nIn addition to the above, if you haven\u2019t already, just tell her you don\u2019t think she should be skipping her job for the side business and you don\u2019t feel comfortable when get-togethers with friends turn to her trying to sell them flowers.\n\nIf you both can\u2019t have these discussions productively, well, marriage comes with tough discussions and working together as a team, so maybe your plan of time apart is warranted.\n",

Taking time off to go *door-knocking*, in this age of the internet, etsy, and craft fairs, is honestly verging on insane. What is she trying to achieve by interrupting people at home to try and hawk paper flowers?",

I think offering to help her do an in-depth cost analysis of EVERYTHING it costs to make a single flower might show her that there is a lot she can do to grow the business that doesn't include countless unpaid hours hawking her craft on the curb. Count everything from the actual materials, to the gas she uses driving to and from events, and the time she spends on photography and social media marketing. She needs to not only be replacing her current salary to cover household budget needs, but also making a little extra (aka profit) to invest in the business. You can't \"make\" her go back to work but you can insist that the shared household budget comes first financially and the relationship comes first in her priorities as a necessary condition of your continued state togetherness. You can be supportive AND have boundaries! ",

I too have thrown out prices when friends say they like a painting and catch myself. Im curious if she saw your friends success and was inspired or just the reasoning.

            "Although there's no excuse for her skipping out on work and being dishonest with you and her boss, I'd say that this artsy endeavour is only bordering on 'obsession' because there's some thrill in sneakily doing something that she's truly passionate about.   \n\n\nI've seen heaps of people in our generation freak out about general life stuff around 30- it was common for our parents to stick it out in jobs they hated because that's the responsible thing to do. Her friend's success probably made her realise what she's actually passionate about, and what she isn't. I know she's in the wrong in regards to the way she's going about it, but if I were you, I'd ask her if this is all a sign that she'd like to pick up a casual job and get a degree in fine arts, or flesh out her side-business with more time I'd ask her if this is a sign that her day-to-day job doesn't make her 'happy', and, if she's miserable doing it I'd tell her that we'll work together to figure out a way in which she can feel fulfilled while she works. You're doing your PhD so I assume you already have this sort of passion in regards to work/school, because nobody really sticks it out to PhD if they don't.   \n\n\nPersonal anecdote time: My partner has always loved music- he had a guitar from age 6, can play very well, is a trained singer and used to try and write songs all throughout his teenage years whilst dreaming of touring around the world. But, the world sorta broke him down and he saw nothing coming from his efforts, so he got a degree in I.T. and went on to work full-time as a technician- for years he said it was fine, and then he hit 30 and had a bit of a drunken freak-out, saying he 'never thought he would have to settle when he was a kid, but everyone just works until they die, how depressing'. Well, fuck that I say- I'm a school therapist and I love going into work everyday, my work's fulfilling- I want him to have that.   \n\n\nSo, I bought him a pretty nice acoustic guitar as a belated birthday present- I encouraged him to seek out a part-time job and once he found one, he should quit because I don't want him working in misery ASAP. He found work at a bar, we moved to a cheaper suburb in our city and he quit. He was absolutely *ecstatic* and he started to remind me of the guy he was when he was 24! When he wasn't at the bar, he was practising and trying to write music. After a few weeks he sought out a busking license and started doing that in the city centre, performing to pedestrians, and he made decent money! People would crowd around him and not leave until songs were over. People would request songs that they loved- we didn't have as much money as we used to, but he was so much happier every day which is worth its weight in gold. Skip two years and he's busking, tutoring kids in guitar and making passive income on a couple of lesser known (but well liked) albums he's released & playing local gigs (and all this tied together is about as much as he used to make) expect he doesn't have a crushed soul.  \n\n\nSorry for the ramble.

I know I would absolutely consider beautiful paper flowers which I could them preserve in a shadow box or display permanently as a memento of my wedding for example. I'd also consider beautiful paper flower wedding memento displays for people who I know have a personal involvement in my marriage, like my in laws for instance.\n\nIf GF does some research into what the trend is in terms of looks for wedding bouquets, what's selling hot on Etsy in that category, comes up with some solid designs and commits to presenting them well on Etsy and locally (which is going to involve learning about SEO, taking great photo's, writing great descriptions - storytelling is HUGE on Etsy for example, people don't just buy a product, they buy a story and experience) - There's definitely a potential for her to not just make a little profit, but to actually build a business there.

Believe me, it would mean so much for her. \n\nI wish you the best in your relationship! ",
            "if you cannot accept the girl, just leave it, find other one that you can accept.  \ni married 2 times so far, 2nd marriage is work out because of we speak everything out. i mean everything. we not hide anything, even if i have crush in my office i let her know, and we speak about how to solve it. If family is important to me i find another job. attraction chemistry is nature, you cannot avoid that.  \n\n\nSolution to your \"problem\".  \ni assume you don't know her well enough. you should encourage her to do what ever she will happy to do for the rest of her life. Trust me, nature of woman is to nurture, man are bread winner and guardian of his family.   \nWe are human being the greatest design in entire universe. you need to let your feeling speak and let your heart hear. you will find the answer for everything.

            "I'm also an artisan. The first month, I made only around 100 bucks. Now I make my living out of it. It took hours and hours of work and effort and it was TOTALLY worth it as I was never happier with my professional life. To me it sounds like your fiancee has found her passion and you are being very unsupportive. I saw people calling it a \"hobbie\" in the comments, and well, maybe it's not a hobbie to her. She's probably feeling unhappy at her day job and is looking for something that makes her want to wake up everyday, and it looks like she found it! Great! Of course she'll not be making buckets of money right from the start, but it looks like she's doing very well and willing to put on the effort. It takes time, but this could be great for her. You should support her instead of putting her down.",

        "selftext": "[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/48w633/by_sheer_coincidence_i_25f_just_started_a_new_job/)\n\n**tl;dr original** I had an awful one night stand with this guy Eric. I basically got very drunk and started crying after sex on our first date. Just started a new job, and guess who works with me? Eric. He is telling everyone what happened between us, and I'm very embarrassed.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThanks to everyone who responded to my original post! Most of you told me to keep my head high, own what happened, and focus on my work, and that's exactly what I did. To those of you reminding me to tell my boyfriend, I actually already had, and he was supportive and sympathetic to my situation.\n\n\nAnyway, you guys were right, I just had to wait for things to blow over. It's been about two weeks since I posted and one month since I started my new job. I made a really diligent effort to be really helpful, friendly, and hardworking, and it worked! I'm getting along with all my coworkers now, including Eric. I no longer feel paranoid that people are whispering about me being crazy or anything. \n\n\nIn fact, what inspired me to write this post was that Eric and I had been assigned to tackle a project together. Yesterday we both had to stay late to wrap up a presentation we had been working on for a while, which was the first time we had ever actually been alone (well, besides for the time we had sex). \n\n\nI was nervous about it but determined to just focus on work and get through it. But we had a little downtime while we were uploading our presentation/video to the server and we started chatting, at which point I made a self deprecating joke \"If this thing crashes I might just burst into tears again.\"\n\n\nHe laughed at that and we ended up clearing the air. He first started by apologizing if he or anyone at work had made me uncomfortable. And then he described our Tinder incident last summer, but from his perspective:\n\n\nBasically, he had actually just downloaded Tinder that week over the summer when we started talking. I was the first person he had ever talked to or gone on a date with through the app. His work friends were actually the ones who encouraged him to download it, so they knew about me and our planned date almost from the beginning. They were actually the ones who suggested the beer festival. \n\n\nSo, we have our date and it goes horribly, and of course on Monday everyone is asking him how it goes. And he basically explains to them what happened, and they all laugh off the situation with how awful that must have been, and how it sucks that that was his first date, and maybe Tinder just isn't for him, blahblahblah.\n\n\nSo when I first start working there, they ALL already knew who I was, from way back summer. Which is actually kind of a relief, because it means that Eric didn't immediately see me and spill the beans to everyone like some jerk. \n\n\nEric and I then cleared the air and said that from getting to know me over the last month I seem very cool and professional, and he hopes that there is no ill will between us. I said definitely not, I don't blame him for what happened. I explained very briefly about how I was just in a bad place when I met him that summer from losing my job, and just drank too much, and he said not to worry about it and he totally understands. I'm just glad we were able to address the elephant in the room. \n\n\nAlso, about the one friend I had made previously who told me what Eric was saying. She actually is relatively new to the office also, and *wasn't* around last summer when this Tinder thing happened. So from her perspective, it looked like Eric was spreading a fresh rumor, when in actuality people were discussing stuff they already had known. \n\n\nSo yeah! Things are good!\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Everything blew over on its own, I just focused on myself and getting work done. Eric and I ended up clearing the air, and he said that our coworkers were actually the ones who made him get Tinder, so they knew about me from the very beginning. No malicious rumors were intentionally spread, and everybody is on good terms now!",

            "> which was the first time we had ever actually been alone (well, besides for the time we had sex)\n\n\nLaughed at this. Good for you OP! I was worried from your original post that you had been thrown into some cliquey and gossip-fueled work environment, but this really just seems like an innocent misunderstanding. Yay!",
            "This is a great update and I'm really happy things are going well for you now!\n\nKeeping yourself professional, positive, and helpful at work has shown people that you are more than a friend's funny anecdote. You are an asset to have on the team. I'm glad that you and Eric got to clear the air.\n\nYou should also be thankful to the newish coworker that told you. She might end up being someone who likes to gossip, but if she was just giving you a heads up about what people were saying, I know I would appreciate it in your situation. \n\nIs your bf happy that things have blown over? Some people would have trouble with their partner working with someone they've slept with. ",

Luckily, she's not also a human being or a professional or anything, so no worries about making her feel like shit in a new environment. Ha ha ha, remember that time she cried after sex with me? Good times.\"",
            "How could everyone know who you are from tinder? Eight months later they remember your picture that somebody showed them once? I believe eric is just covering his ass, sounds like a douche. ",
            "So when you two start dating again, fall in love, and write a movie script that is a hit Rom-Com, make sure to remember us.",
            "\"So when I first start working there, they ALL already knew who I was, from way back summer.\"\n\nThat story doesn't add up. Eric may have regaled them with his one-night stand story in summer. However I really doubt he told them your full name or provided a photo. If he did, he's a complete creep and weirdo. It's one thing to mock a stranger sexually, but it's another to provide full photos and names to your co-workers.\n\nIf he didn't go that far, how on earth would anyone recognise you when you came in to work months later?",
