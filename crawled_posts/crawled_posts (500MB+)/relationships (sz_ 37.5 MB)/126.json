        "selftext": "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ohktt5/my24f_boyfriend_23m_sometimes_make_self/)\n\nI just decided to tell him to stop making those jokes. He listened to me apologized for making them and said he would stop. He wrote me a sweet letter telling me that I was his type.  He hasn't made one that particular joke once but he started to make a lot more jokes calling himself an idiot. \n\nI again asked him why he was doing it and he said it was just jokes but it didn't feel like it. I finally sat him down asked if he felt okay and happy? I remember one of the commenter saying that he may have been unhappy in the relationship and that had gotten to me. He said he happy with our relationship but he was not happy with himself and he felt deeply lost and he constantly keeps critiquing himself. He said everything he did comes back to haunt him. \n\nI have realized that he has a very low opinion of himself which I find tragic as he has so much to offer to the world. so many people look up at him and love him but he probably feels like he doesn't deserve it. He is going to get a referral to a therapist. \n\nI feel a bit insecure because I feel like I contributed to his problems. I am sometimes critical of him but apparently he doesn't mind that because he feels relived when he knows what exactly he has done wrong? I don't understand this completely but I think I will just try to be there for him. I hope he feels better about himself. He is the person that makes me the happiest and I want him to be happy too.  \n\nTLDR : My boyfriend corrected his behavior but continued to make other self deprecating jokes. He seems to have sever self esteem issues. He is planning to go therapy.",

            ">I feel a bit insecure because I feel like I contributed to his problems. I am sometimes critical of him but apparently he doesn't mind that because he feels relived when he knows what exactly he has done wrong?\n\n\nOne of the worst parts about having low self-esteem is that it's easy to assume that everyone around you is mad about every single thing you do, and your imagination can get pretty creative at coming up with plausible scenarios where it makes sense that they would be mad. When that happens, it can feel like waking up from a nightmare when they say \"It's kind of frustrating that you haven't taken the trash out yet\" and you realize that the only problem was actually very minor and easy to handle.",
            "It sounds like you identified the problem(s), communicated about it, and you're on the right paths to sorting them out. Hold him accountable about his promise to go to therapy and help him with it if you can. Nowadays more therapists are working remotely, personally I find it much easier to just have a one hour phone call once a month. Some of them will take payment over Venmo etc if you dont have insurance.\n\nThe deeply low opinion of himself thing is a serious issue but if he handles it well he will be deeply grateful that you stuck with him.",
            "I'm glad that this had a positive outcome. I can, somewhat relate to the problem of thinking my partner is way more better than me in every possible angle, and that helps to projects some insecurities how we think our partners think about us, wich might hurt some healty relationships, sometimes.\n\nThat thing about criticizing him, if he says that he's relived, then you have nothing to worry about i guess. If someone is always critizing himself in every manner, when other person makes that critique it might help him differenciate of what is real critiques and what is just impostors syndrome.\n\n So, good luck, congrats for the open talking.",
            "It sounds like you did the right things to get him to seek help for the underlying issue. That's the important part of this. You didn't let it go.",
            "He has taken on board what you said, realised he has a real problem and is ready and willing to get professional help to deal with it. He is on the right track. \n\nSo are you. You spotted that his self-deprecating habit was not just humour, were able to bring up the subject with him, and in such a way he felt comfortable to open up to you about his true feelings. And you listened and are willing to support him to get better.\n\nHope you both make it.",
            "not that you have to be thinking about marriage at 24, but this is why my wife and I are together. what works isn't indicated by the \"good times\" because most people can have fun together when doing something fun, what works shows itself by how you resolve conflict. We hash it out, find the \"real\" reason why something came up, and then address the \"why\" instead of just the behavior.\n\nwe're not into \"old people\" territory yet but we're 11 years and going strong. gl to you and your SO!",
            "My guess, is that he thinks you are out of his league. I had that issue once. I was dating someone who was incredibly beautiful, smart, and funny. For the life of me, I couldn't see why she would date someone like me. And it really began to eat at my self confidence. \n\nYour Bf's jokes may have been an attempt to guage your reaction. To see if there is any truth in what he fears. He may worry that you will eventually \"come to your senses\" and leave him. At least that's how I viewed my situation.",
            "My husband is the same way about jokes.  It used to be every once in a while, especially when stressed, but when the pandemic started he was constantly putting himself down multiple times a day.  For example, I was working one day and called a work project a piece of shit, he responded with \"I know I am, I'm sorry.\" Shit like that isn't okay.  It made me feel like an abuser.  It felt made me feel complicit in his depression.  He was weaponizing my negative emotions to harm himself.\n\nOne day I snapped and asked him why the hell he thought it was okay to speak about my husband that way to me.  That I don't allow anyone to disparage my husband and I wasn't sure why he thought he was different.   It shocked my husband.  He took some time and thought about everything that had been going on, then he apologized to me.  I accepted that and told him if it's not okay to say to other people it's not okay to say it about yourself.",
            "Within the last few years my husband has made headway in this process. He described a turning point for him was realizing that he didn't like himself because of the depression, not that his dislike for himself caused the depression. It really helped him to see those thoughts as a symptom rather than the cause. \n\nThose things still sneak in, but that's now his cue to look around for the other triggers he has (medication, not enough sleep, too much going on) and adjust.\n\nThen key was finding a therapist he clicked with who asked him the harder followup questions that he needed to work through things.\n\nHope your SO finds someone he clicks with.",
            "the most helpful thing for me has been to repeat \"I choose not to self harm\" over and over. I realised I was mentally torturing myself hundreds or thousands of times in a day, to an extent I had no idea. Trying  to \"be better\" was just doubling down on the self hate. So the only thing that has helped is to start reinforcing over and over again that \"I choose not to engage in self-harm\" without putting a definition of what that would look like attached. A lot of the time its just to stop replaying social interactions or critiqueing myself for not doing something the \"proper\" way. I deserve to be able to relax in my own home, and feel comfortable in my body even if my idealised self wants to bully me into being ashamed of anything less than perfection at all times.",
            "I realized that I was self loathing and all around just a negative person towards myself and the people I love or should love. It was a big wake up call for me when I realized that life wasn't miserable and that I don't have to feel these feelings of self hate which then gets spread around everyone else. My best defense mechanism was laughter but I would make fun of others and myself most of the time. My perspective on life was so bad it's like that was the only way I knew how to act. It took someone I really cared about to tell me things I've said to them and how it hurt them. Basically without that person keeping it real with me and putting up with my bs for so long I would never of changed my perspective and I hope your bf comes to the same resolution. I hope he never stops with just the one sweet thing, but continues to better himself and his outlook on life each and everyday. You'll know if he's changed for real by his words demeanor and actions improving on a consistent basis. Best of luck!",
            "Planning to go to therapy and actually making a plan, calling a doctor, making an appointment, and then going to that appointment... are very different things.",
            "If you are giving criticism in a healthy constructive way and he is able to see it as constructive/solution oriented, it helps him because it 1. helps him stop catastrophizing (imagining worst case scenarios, exaggerating his self hatred based on those what ifs, etc) and 2. it gives him an actionable item to do and once it\u2019s done he has a tangible Thing tell his self hatred goblin to shut the fuck up. This isn\u2019t a long term solution - the self hatred goblin shouldn\u2019t be so loud in the first place - but it is an effective coping mechanism in the meantime while he is working on the volume and insistence of said brain goblin in therapy.\n\nIf you are giving feedback in the way he best receives it but he\u2019s beating himself up still or twisting it in a way to use it as a weapon against himself/to confirm the catastrophizing and what the self hatred brain goblin says - that\u2019s nothing to feel guilty about. therapy will help him. you can feel bad for him that he\u2019s in pain, but it\u2019s not your fault.\n\nNow if your feedback is not being given in the way he best receives it (and it might be worth trying it different ways; some people like a \u201ccompliment sandwich\u201d, I like to be told in order \u201cyou\u2019re doing x wrong, do y to fix it, and i did like how you did z-related-thing so keep that up\u201d which results in crit, solution, and reassurance - there are other ways, as well), or if you are being abusive or cruel, then sure, you can help by changing how you give criticism.\n\nmore than likely it has to do with his internal processing. which the therapy can help with.",
            "That \u2018relief\u2019 he feels when you tell him what he\u2019s done wrong? That\u2019s his self dating thoughts getting validation. Do not listen to that. That\u2019s his brain going \u2018see, she thinks it too, so it must be true. You\u2019re worthless\u2019\n\nStop being so harsh and critical of him, you say yourself he\u2019s amazing and offers so much. Do you praise him like that, even when he\u2019s not going through problems? Because that can be a big help to people who feel worthless",
            "Remind him that people in general are self centered. Not in a bad way, it's just our self preservation wiring. But we do grow up and learn that it isn't all about us anymore at some point. So everybody isn't sitting around thinking about what a bad person he is, or what kind of person he is at all. They don't really care, and I mean that in a good way. Developmentally as babies we had to think it was all about us because that's how we got our needs met, by focusing on that. But as we grow, we think of others and realize nobody but ourselves can determine what kind of person we are and it is up to us to define and become that which we want to be.",
            "Sounds like a great bit of self awareness on your bf\u2019s part. He sounds like some therapy will help his inner dialogue become more positive",
            "By the way, judging from this tiny glance at your situation, your boyfriend sounds a lot like my mother. Constantly doubting herself. In her case it's the upbringing and years of an abusive relationship with my father. So I think I get in a roundabout way how those types of comments can be hurtful even though they have everything to do with him and nothing with you.\n\nI hope he gets the help he needs while he's young, before he truly internalizes this low trust of himself. Thank you for being a conscientious person and helping him with this task.",
            "I just wanted to say when me or my fianc\u00e9 make these kinds of self-deprecating comments, the other immediately says \u201chey don\u2019t talk about my friend that way!\u201d It snaps us right out of it. I don\u2019t know y\u2019all\u2019s sense of humor and if this will work for you guys but I thought I\u2019d mention it!",
            "Self-deprecating humor, when done right, can be a great way to endear yourself to others, and lighten the mood at your own expense. However, going too far with it ends up having the opposite effect, and it sounds like you found that going on here. \n\nI think it's great that you both communicated about this openly and worked to determine a path to try and get him, and your relationship, back on solid footing. Know that it may not happen quickly, and it may take him time to work through these self-image issues. What I would say is give him space, and don't overcompensate. It will probably be instinctive for you to try and build him up, compliment him more so than usual, to strengthen his confidence. I wouldn't do that as he will likely see through it and it may backfire. Be selective, and thoughtful, in your compliments and appreciation. Trust that he'll get there.\n\nFinally, you mentioned insecurity due to sometimes being critical of him. I may be over-interpreting this, but I would just caution in how you approach him about these things. It sounds like it's not an issue for him, which is great, but just be careful to approach him about these things in way towards solving the issue, rather than observing it and \"complaining\" about it. Again, this may be something you're already doing, but I find it's very helpful if someone says to me (or I say to others) something like \"Hey, this is bothering/concerning/worrying me, and I was hoping we could talk through it together.\" \n\nThe key I find for this is to not jump on it in the moment when it happens. Let some time pass, and come back to it later. It won't be so fresh and hot in your mind, and lets you approach it more collaboratively, if that makes sense.\n\nYou may already be there on a lot of this, but the way you phrased that concern of yours made me want to mention it. Best of luck!",

            "I'm proud of him for looking into therapy. It personally helped me immensely when I was in a very *very* bad place in terms of depression and general well being.

            "Dude's got depression. It's cool, it's treatable, but don't just ignore it or try to tough it out. Depression is a disease, and there's no shame in getting professional help for it, any more than there would be for getting a cast on a broken leg or insulin for your diabetes.\n\nIt sounds like you two love each other a lot and have good communication, which is an excellent base to work from. I know therapy and antidepressants can seem intimidating, but they're much better than living with untreated depression. Take it from someone who knows!",

            "I think what he means is it's refreshing to have someone communicate their thoughts and feelings, instead of bottling them up and becoming resentful or exploding.

You can't control how he feels about it, or how he feels about himself, because all of those feelings are valid.

Well, I had the day off and decided to show up for breakfast at the same time as him. It worked out perfectly!\n\nI sat down in the area where he always sits and waited. About 10 minutes later, he walked in the door and saw me sitting down ordering breakfast. He came up to me and looked a little puzzled because I wasn't wearing my uniform. He asked if I had the day off and I said yes. He said, \"That sucks, you're my favorite waitress!\"\n\nI also did my hair and put on some cute clothes that morning and he noticed because he complimented me and said I looked, \"really pretty.\" I could feel my face getting hot. I probably turned 10 shades of red. lol. \n\nNext thing I know, he asked if he could sit at my table with me! I was so nervous. Guys never give me butterflies but he gives them to me all the time. But I acted totally normal and tried not to be a dork. haha! \n\nNormally, I'm very shy around him but he made me feel comfortable and was super easy to talk to. We sat and talked for awhile before our breakfast came. It was so much fun. My manager was the one waiting on us, which she NEVER does but she's been encouraging me to make a move on him for quite awhile. She was so happy for me!\n\nAnyway, I felt like he was giving me signals the entire time, which made me a lot more confident. So I finally worked up the courage and asked if he'd like to hang out some time and he agreed! We swapped numbers and he's been texting/flirting with me a few times a day ever since! \n\nSince we've been texting, I've learned that we both enjoy hiking, so I suggested that we go hiking and check out an old lighthouse, which isn't too far from where we live. He just moved here, so he's never seen it before. (We live on the great lakes, Northern Michigan.) So that's what we're planning on doing this weekend!\n\nWhen we were texting last night, he mentioned that he'd like to go to this fall festival, which is coming up in a couple of weeks and wanted to know if I'd go with him. So I playfully said, \"Are you asking me out on a date? hehe\" and he said, \"Yes.. Will you please go with me? :)\"  I'm so excited!!!\n\nThank you all for your help on my original post! You guys gave me a ton of great advice. I can't believe how easy this whole thing was. Now I see what men have to go through when it comes to asking women out! Anyway, thank you Reddit!\n\nTl;Dr: Success! We're hanging out and going out on a date!

        "selftext": "OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/42lbdj/my_25m_wife_26f_has_had_lice_for_almost_a_year/\n\nHello. After several months of absolutely no progress, I really wasn't expecting to have an update for you all after just a few days but here it is!\n\nI talked to her when I got home and managed to find a few minutes alone without distractions and asked her for a status update on the lice removal. Long story short, I was met with another excuse as to why it would have to wait until next week and my foot came down. I don't think she took it seriously until later on in the night when we went to bed. I slept on our futon instead of with her and also turned her down for sex, which is something that I am pretty sure has happened only like twice in our entire relationship.\n\nThe very next day she called and made an appointment to get professionally de-loused. I went with to the appointment and they were able to check me as well. The woman did not find anything in my hair even with a magnifying glass and a UV light that apparently makes the nits glow. My wife was treated and is now lice free.\n\nWe talked afterwards about why it took so long for her to get it taken care of. Many of you were right; she was embarrassed, broke, discouraged from the hours we wasted trying to treat it ourselves in the beginning, and it was just easier for her to not think about it. Also, once we moved into my parent's house, she was even more embarrased and did not want them to know about it. Pretty much all of the at-home treatments would be a dead giveaway. She apologized, vacuumed, did all of our laundry and bedding, and we have put this annoyance behind us. We also checked our son when he got home from school and he's in the clear too.\n\nSo that's that! Still have to get to the bottom of why someone would think it's preferable to have lice than to deal with the embarrasment of people knowing you have lice, but I think that's one of those pesky communication things that we have to work on. \n\nThanks very much to those of you that responded with legitimate advice. I got over 100 PM's after my post was locked regarding lice treatments that you found successful lol. Since the last post got a ton more attention than I was expecting and the comments were like 60% misinformation about lice, I'll clear a few things up with info that I learned from the professionals at the delousing clinic (I hope this isn't against the rules):\n\nLice can't live anywhere except on a human head and they die about 24 hours if they are away. \n\nSince they die so quickly, it's not possible to have a \"lice infestation\" in your home or on your furniture. All we were told to do to make sure she doesn't get re-infected from a stray lice was to either stay away from unwashed pillows/hats/bedding for a couple days or to wash it in hot water.\n\nSome people are immune to lice and differen't \"families\" (the word the delouser used) of lice only like certain types of hair. In other words, it's entirely possible to live with someone with lice and not get lice.\n   \n**tl;dr**: Good talk, no more lice, still unresolved root issues, progress!",

            "My mother used to say, \"If you ever come home with lice...just don't come home.\" There was so much disgust toward people who got lice, I really thought it was the most shameful thing that could happen to a person. I never got lice.\nI moved to California as an adult, where pretty much every child gets lice at some point in their school career, and my kids got it. I truly lost my mind. On top of that, they had it during a time when the Bay Area had a particularly virulent \"Superlice\" epidemic, so home treatments just weren't getting rid of it. It took a long time and many visits to doctors and after a few weeks, even a woman we hired to come to our home to professionally delouse the kids and home. \n\nLice do die fairly quickly when not on a host, and as long as the professional service got all the nits when she treated her, I think you're in the clear. ",
            "I had lice when I was a child. I'm actually kind of embarrassed to admit that it was a pretty traumatic experience for me. I had insane itching of the scalp and my doctor (who checked my head) gave me a \"shampoo\" for eczema. As a 10 year old that nobody was taking seriously, I was pretty frustrated. I was positive that what I had was lice - I could feel them running around on my scalp! When I would itch, I would also pick and finally the day came where I picked out a bug itself.\n\nTook a few weeks to get it taken care of... Never wished I could go to school that badly as during those two weeks. All this to say, I cannot imagine how it was easier for your wife to ignore it.. the itching is god damn unbearable.. Glad to hear she took you seriously, though.",
            ">differen't \"families\" (the word the delouser used) of lice only like certain types of hair\n\nLice have feet that are shaped to grip the hair shaft, and the ones that are shaped to hold onto straight hair (which is round) don't work with curly hair (which is oval) or kinky hair (which is almost flat) and visa versa all the way around.\n\n",
            "Excellent news!  I know this was really bugging you.  <cough>  Health and hygiene are more important than pride.  Now that they're gone, please reward her good decision with a full salon treatment, if you can.\n\nedit: they're.  Sheesh.",
            "A few years ago I was having some issues with my scalp itching and bleeding in places, so I went to a dermatologist. One of the first things he did was check for lice, and immediately said \"it's nothing to be embarrassed about, you'd be surprised by how many people live with lice and don't seek treatment because there's a stigma associated with having lice.\" \n\nMy issue was actually due to psoriasis, but how quickly the dermatologist brought up lice makes me think it's not uncommon for people to just kind of suffer through having that problem. ",
            "Well, this turned out better than I expected. Good on you for finally putting your foot down.\n\nMy only suggestion would be to keep an eye out for any lice in weeks to come. It's pretty easy to miss something when you have to wash *everything*. \n\n",
            "So, I live in a state that is very lice-prone.  My daughter (9) has gotten it 3 times and given it to me twice.  Please.  Please.  Please.  For the love of all that is holy - get a take home treatment and treat with the shampoo 7-10 days after her initial treatment.  If they missed two nits which happen to birth a male and a female, they may mate and cause reinfestation.  The life cycle is such that the nits hatch within the first 7 days of being laid, but don't become sexually mature adults until 10 days after hatching.  So if you kill them after they are all hatched, but before they reproduce - BOOM.  Done.  Forever.  Try to convince her to do this.  Don't listen if she said the place gave a guarantee that they got them all.  They only guarantee if you follow the aftercare!",
            "> Still have to get to the bottom of why someone would think it's preferable to have lice than to deal with the embarrasment of people knowing you have lice, but I think that's one of those pesky communication things that we have to work on.\n\nJust don't expect a *rational* reason. Her fear of embarrassment trumped her fear of lice, and her mind learned to shy away from even thinking about them. It's something people's brains just do, sometimes.",
            "Good work OP :). Glad you put your foot down and pressed for further communication. ",
            "I have had lice several times in my life and always got rid of them as soon as possible. My primary school (elementary school for you Americans) was really bad for lice because there was one family that would not treat their children so these massive lice were going about from peoples hair. I can remember having lice so many times as a kid. \n\nAnd my mum never caught them once. She's worked with patients (she's a nurse) and they have been 'crawling' with lice, her words not mine, and she would do a check and find she didn't have any at all. Some people just don't get them, whether it's their hair they don't like or what. Lice don't like hair products like gel, they don't like hair that gets treated regularly or straightened/curled (too hot) and some people have blood that they don't like. \n\nI'm glad to hear this actually got sorted OP as I was horrified in your original post that someone could go 8 months with lice in their hair. I think you definitely need to speak to your wife about why she thought that was OK and think about some sort of therapy. But nonetheless, well done on the progress made!",
            ">So that's that! Still have to get to the bottom of why someone would think it's preferable to have lice than to deal with the embarrasment of people knowing you have lice, but I think that's one of those pesky communication things that we have to work on. \n\nStigma is real, and hurts people by driving them away from seeking care.  Fortunately, this wasn't something that could really hurt her (though it was gross).",
            "Get a lice comb (you can also use a nice metal flea comb for pets) around and periodically run it through everyone's hair to just check.\n\nGet your own UV light so that you can continue to be vigilant.  You can get them for under $5 many places online.\n\nIt's very easy to get lice again, all you need to do is just miss one egg.  It took us 3 attempts when my son had them.\n",
            "I just don't buy this. I treated headlice professionally with a very reputable company and there is no way untreated lice for a full year wouldn't be totally obvious. Either she did try intermittently to treat it and that kept the louse population down, or this is a troll post. Also...lice nits do not glow, not in any light.",
            "You must feel so relieved. Thank god its over with. ",
            "I wasn't able to comment in the other thread, but I feel you. My daughter brought it home from a girl scout camp out and it took a while to get rid of. \n\nLots of people commented about how you do the shampoo and it's done. They're wrong - those treatments rarely work anymore. They also think that with your wife having it for so long that everyone will get it which is also wrong. One of the main reasons is that lice only survive off of the initial blood type that they were \"born\" into. \n\nGetting my daughter professionally treated was some of the best money I ever spent, even though it was so expensive. The woman who treated her was awesome and made her feel so much more at ease, plus she gave us a tutorial and showed me how to check her now. Seeing my daughter brighten up at having the issue gone made me mad that I didn't do it much, much sooner. ",
            "Wow, well glad it's resolved! Just for future potential outbreaks for anyone reading this, go out and pick up a 'Robi comb' as it is amazeballs. It's a lice comb that basically electrocutes them as you run  it through your hair; lice and eggs and it beeps when there's a 'hit.' My kids got lice a few times and the robi comb handled things 100%; easy, no poisons and damn effective!",
            "everyone who keeps saying you need to delouse the entire house.. that's for bed bugs, not head lice",
            "I don't think lice like black people hair. I dated this girl who was white and she had two mixed sons and a white one. The white one got lice, we didn't. We laughed. Apparently our hair they can't stick to or something. I'm winning at something at least \ud83d\ude01",
            "The jail (correctional facility) in our town had a year long lice infestation amongst the inmates. The lice were said to be like \"super lice\", so big you could see them crawling around in their hair. I was\nhorrified for their inmate population. It just seems so neglectful and inhumane to put them into a situation where they would be exposed to that (where they can't get away) and then not treat it properly. ",
            "Great update.  Suggestions about hats and laundry do not run counter to what you say. Lice obviously can crawl for up to 24 hours so things that are near a head need to be taken care of.  They do not live on like bedbugs, in colonies in beds, but even bedbugs need to eat frequently.  \n\nI never thought about it but what exactly do live eat???   Anyone know?\n\nGlad your wife got treated and that you are so understanding.   ",
            "Good to hear a happy ending and get some fun facts about lice.",
            "Congrats!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOn a similar note, I kinda know your wife's pain.  When I was in my early 30's, my kids brought home lice.  I'd never had it before and nothing worked.  Instead of going the route your wife did, tho, I went in the opposite direction.  I was bound and determined that I was going to get rid of them and make those little fuckers pay.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat I found was an electric comb.  It's battery powered and it electrocutes every one of the little fuckers, killing them.  It killed every thing: eggs, larvae and adult.  It also makes a very satisfying squeal every time it hit one, allowing me to imagine them screaming as I electrocuted those little bastards.",

This will come up again in some other form.  You need to get to the bottom of it while there isn't something else going on",
            "Once time has passed and you guys can laugh about this, can you please make a joke about the time she was a \"lousy wife\"?",
            "I think a lot of people conflate lice with other nefarious pests (such as scabies for example, which can infest an area and require a fairly serious intervention).  Thanks for bringing the information as well as the happy news!",
            "I lived with a roommate that had a child and she got lice on many occasions. I never once got it. People can definitely be immune.",

            "Good on you, sir, for getting that done, and good luck with everything.",

            "Once you've tried everything that has worked for everyone else, and it doesn't work, you feel like there is something wrong with you. That you are a terrible failure and especially gross since regular treatments didn't work.\n\nEventually you feel that you deserve to live with the pain and torment, so you do.",
            "It's great that the lice issue has been resolved, but I'm with you on this:\n\n>Still have to get to the bottom of why someone would think it's preferable to have lice than to deal with the embarrasment of people knowing you have lice\n\nYeah.  This is strange behavior, especially considering that she knew *you* knew about the lice.  Even if nothing like this has ever occurred before with your wife, she might want to talk to someone.  Perhaps you guys could try couples counseling, since she's unlikely to speak to anyone on her own?\n\nI'm not sure if therapy is an overreaction, but I would be ***so*** weirded out by my partner behaving in this way.",
            "I am so glad you got it taken care off! I had a friend who actually cut her hair short all the way, and then applied mayonnaise for them to go away. She used wigs for a while, but now she is completely fine, and beautiful long hair. I would post a picture of her back then and now, but she would hate me forever. ",

One of the young 3-4 year old was sitting on my lap and my waist-length hair was down.  A few days later I'm taking a shower and can feel it on my scalp.  I screamed and my mom thought I fell.

The oldest child had thick, curly red hair and was the worst (he was patient zero). \n  \nAfter 5 months of lice I managed to talk him into shaving his hair off. It was disgusting. With every run of the clippers hundreds of bugs fell onto the floor. Every male in the house got buzz cuts and patient zero was the worst. The girls got a bob cut and I spent hours combing through their hair and tossing the nits and lice into boiling water. My foster sister opted to get a buzz cut as well. \n  \nI was the only one not infected during this ordeal and I still don't know how.",

Basically I blow dried the roots of my hair and my kid's hair every day for a few weeks and went through our hair with a flat iron, and then they all died. Lice don't really live on clothes and sheets so if you wash your sheets regularly anyway, they won't come back.\n\nLice is one of those things that really do more psychological damage than having it. I can see why she was embarrassed and didn't get professional help - it's not threatening to your health, it's just gross. Freaking out about it can make you go into denial.",

I'm glad she got it taken care of but I think she still has a lot to work out on why she thought it was acceptable to neglect herself to the point where she had lice for a YEAR. That shows some serious mental instability.\n\n And I know it wasn't your responsibility, but I'm also a little bit concerned for your own mental stability that you let it go on for that long when you have children, family, and pretty much anyone you come into contact with. I don't agree with you making excuses like, \"well some people don't get it.\" Let me just tell you that I have gotten lice as an adult and it freaking sucks. I either got it from an airplane, movie theatre, or nail salon. So fuck the person who came in with lice and gave it to me. Luckily I took care of it right away so no one else would be subjected to that madness.  ",
            "People can be embarrassed about a lot of health issues, sometimes it's even the fear of getting \"treatment\" you don't want. For example when I was a child, I had grown-in nails on my big toes. NOBODY was allowed to see my feet for 7 years, because it looked really disgusting, and when I finally asked a doctor she said that it's most likely untreatable and surgery(cutting half of the toe away) would probably be the only way to do it. Welp. I asked my mom to do a quick Google and she told me the chance of the toe really being \"good\" after that procedure was not that big, and tbh I didn't want to lose half of my big toes. Well fast forward a year and after putting 80%-ish alcohol on it every day it's gone.",

It drove me insane to the point where i was breaking down every day about it. \n\nI was ashamed so I tried to do it myself, but like how the fuck does someone be so ashamed they have it for YEARS. And i'm sorry, but even if the lice die within 24 hours it's so easy to pass on. I lay my head down on the pillow, there is nits and lice on it. All it takes is someone else within those 24 hours to lay down on the pillow as well. Not to mention when I would scratch those buggers would come off as well. A lice \"infestation\" no, but when you have someone who has them moving around all day in a house it's really surprising how you guys never got any. \n\nLice do love clean hair, though and I wish people wouldn't assume that just because I had lice didn't mean I was dirty. ",
            "FWIW, over the counter lice treatments are not 100% effective.\n\nEven prescription remedies can lose their effectiveness if the population getting treated are not wiped out completely: any that escape alive are apt to be resistant, a trait usually passed to offspring.\n\nGlad you got it squared away- it is indeed worrisome that it took so long.",

He told me that he just went to pee and then saw his dad in the kitchen who couldn't sleep and they had a chat for a while. Liar.\n\nI asked his sister in law immediately after that, said that I saw her from the window for a second. Was I just imagining it since I was half sleep or did she go out \"alone\" that time of night? She said that she enjoys midnight breaths and alone walks on the beach. Liar again.\n\nI told his brother that I saw them leave. He told me that they enjoy long walks on the beach. He couldn't be bothered to go with them. I thought liar.\n\nSo apparently they gave each other the heads up since my boyfriend came to me and told me everything an hour later. Him and his brother like sharing their girlfriends and SOs. He's been fucking his sister in law for years now. That night was just another moment. He told me that he wanted to tell me when the time is right or when he thought I'm prepared so that I can join in and sleep with his brother so they don't even need to sneak around.\n\nHe wasn't even admitting that it was cheating, saying that it doesn't count since it's his sister in law not some random girl. I don't even know what to say to that. He called me traditional for thinking it was cheating. Yeah. I consider having sex with anyone else cheating, call me traditional.\n\nSo I broke up with him and left him to deal with his weird shit with his brother and I'm actually happier now. The thought of what he was up to all those times grosses me out completely. He can fuck himself. We wanted to go on a holiday together, now I'm gonna go have fun with my cousins instead. \n   \n**tl;dr**: They were fucking. His brother knew. It was their thing. They wanted me involved too. No way. We broke up. Fuck them all. ",

Better you find out now, than years from now after further investment. \n\nGood luck to him finding someone that isn't so 'traditional' to be upset at finding out your monogamous partner is fucking someone else, what a skeeze.

Cheating derives from braking rules, he broke the rules of your relationship, therefore he cheated. SIL is not cheating because the rules she has with her husband state she's allowed to do that. She is however a dick for not checking with you what rules you had with your (hopefully now ex) boyfriend.",

Mass down-votes with no explanation? Did I miss something, or are you people just desperate to believe any and every story that you shoot down anyone with an ounce of reasoning?
