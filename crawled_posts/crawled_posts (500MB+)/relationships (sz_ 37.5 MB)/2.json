        "selftext": "[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3dheie/my_26_f_with_my_husband_29_m_1_year_he_has_been/)\n\nSummary of Original Post- My husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer. After failure of chemo and other treatments, he was told he has about a month to live. I asked for advice on how to make this time count and all of you wonderful people gave some very good advice.\n\n\nLet me begin by saying that as much as I was day dreaming that I'll get to update everyone of a miraculous recovery my brave darling made, I had to wake up to the bitter reality. My husband passed away a few days ago. And just as a lot of you had warned me, with all the preparation in the world and a warning that not many are fortunate to receive, absolutely nothing about when it actually happened felt like I was at all ready. It may as easily have been sudden. He fought bravely to the end and I'm proud of his attitude. I'm happy he doesn't have to suffer and put on a brave face for me anymore.\n\nI'm here to thank all of you. Despite what I said above about not feeling prepared, I do feel blessed for having got that time. We may not have completely finished \"the list\" but we sure got to do some of the things that the busy preoccupations of life in all its cruelty snatches from a lot of people. We may not be completely without regrets but we managed to make our list of 'I wish I had's a lot shorter than it would have been before the warning. So here I am to thank everyone who commented/replied/PMed on that post. It meant a lot to both of us. A sincere thanks to all of you.\n\nA special shout to a few people:\nu/mistyranch for courage and sharing \nu/mcdie88 for making me feel like a 100 years old (covered that milestone too as he insisted I will live his share too!)\nu/tacofugitive for looking out for me\nu/aaoun responsible for some high quality home made porn\nu/dahlialia who irritated the hell out of my husband as I wanted answers to ALL the questions\nu/emalen thanks to whom I thought about this part, the coping\nu/whatsleftisrigh for instilling some pragmatism in me\nu/ianoftawa thanks to whom unfinished business won't be an issue\nu/brandyelf who made X'mas come early this year\nu/tenebrous1 who inspired a letter that I haven't been able to read past two lines of\nu/emlgsh whose words rung in my ears to keep me stronger on the bad days\nu/throwyourtoothbrush without whose advice I would have tried to do it all on my own and made a mess for sure\nu/tomyownrhythm who sure knows how to turn a good spin on the dark moments\nu/daivyjones for the immense support\nu/WeltallPrime for inspiring my very first novel\nand so many others for all the wonderful advice, support and most importantly for sharing your stories, I can't thank you enough. I'm sorry I can't mention all of you here. Please know how much every word meant to me.\n\nHere's an update of all the things we did end up doing (and I hope this will help someone else like us out there):\n1. As suggested by a lot of you, pictures and videos. I have loads of data of him doing his daily chores to just snoring away next to me. And I still don't think it's enough. Do this, you may not have a warning, you may regret it if you don't. A little background of me here, I've always been anti pictures, I would proudly say make memories not photo albums and that if something is important enough, you'll remember it. While I still stand by that to a certain extent, I do condone finding that balance. I would charge my tab, turn on the camera and put it in our room. So I could enjoy him and then re enjoy our moments later. And we made the heavily suggested naughty videos as well. Fair warning, getting closure is important so don't get drowned in these memories either. It's too soon for me but I do understand the risks and will look out for myself.\n2. Which brings me to my next point. Discussing the future. As much as one would want to avoid thinking about a life beyond the one they love the most, not thinking of it will make it that much harder when it inevitably comes. Here's where all the advice on being practical was executed. Practicality on financial and emotional fronts; financial being having ALL the financial information including account numbers, passwords, life insurance policy details, wills and any debts and the latter being arranging for a therapist and talking about expectations from a partner after one is gone and discussing the kids futures, if any. He documented all the financial information and verified it twice, taught me how to access his bank's site and wrote down a step by step guide on how to get the insurance money once he was gone. He wrote a letter addressed to my \"next spouse\" with all the not so easy to discover things about me that were wonderful and necessary, in his words. \n3. I wrote a book about him. I'm an aspiring author and I'm proud to say that the love of my life is the sole reader of my only book.\n4. Scrapbook. This was so fun! I collected screenshots of the best and meanest things we've ever said to each other, printed those, interspersed those with our pictures over the years in chronological order (starting with the cliched obligatory baby pictures), threw in a few lists I wrote out of top 9 dates, top 9 best sex, top 9 reasons I love him (both our birthdays fall on 9th) etc., mixed in a crossword puzzle he had to solve and our scrapbook was ready!\n5. I named a star after him. I know this is slightly silly but now I can look at him whenever I want.\n6. Needless to say, indefinite time off work, spent every waking moment in his arms and sleeping moment in his tightly wrapped arms. Yes, lots of cuddling and just being together.\n7. Balcony picnic. This was an excellent idea. Stars, candlelight, good food and some good old fashioned open air sex\n8. Speaking of which, lots of sex. \n9. We discussed with his doctors and freezing his sperm was not a possibility at this stage so that couldn't pan out. \n10. The last life party. I wanted to call it The party that never ends but he played the cancer card so I was shot down. All his friends and family came over, everyone said a few things about and to him, nobody was allowed to cry, I told them I was spending a lot on the funeral and he was stealing my thunder by being a tear hogger. It was actually pretty nice with gag jokes from his goofy friends, something like a Halloween with a ghost attending but he's friendly like Casper rather than being creepy/scary\n11. Told him I loved him, constantly. And anything else that came to my mind that I wanted him to know! He was quite a sport about it and returned the favor.\n12. We played cards together, watched football matches and his favorite shows together. Things he loves. Casually holding each other.\n13. Festival week- a day designated to all the festivals. Milestone birthdays- video recording for each with a message \n14. Cooked his favorite meals for him. He was my happy helper. He'd wash the tomatoes and I'd make the lasagna. He called me the food conjurer.\n15. Made him wear his favorite shirts for several days so now they'll smell like him for some time.\n16. Knit him a sweater, made a portrait of his\n17. Things very specific to him that he wanted to do- a small bucket list that I won't bore you with\n   \nI feel like I've lived a lifetime in the last month. The quote about living each day like your last got realized. I made a lot of memories I'll never forget. \n\nI want to say one more thing before I sign off. All those who have been patient enough to make it to this part of the post or impatient enough to skip to this part, thanks for reading. I have read a lot of things on this sub and unfortunately a majority of the things I read are escapist, overcautious and pessimistic. While I encourage the right of one to protect themselves from potential hurt, I do find the world hiding behind that right shying away from happiness and condemning others at the drop of a hat. Not meaning to sound preachy or claiming to know anyone's personal situation, I do wish to say this..believe in people, believe in goodness, believe in second chances. My husband and I didn't have it perfect, we had our rough patches and forgave each other for mistakes if the other truly showed repentance for them. I could have left him long back and I would have been in the same scenario I am today, leading a life without him. The difference is I would have chosen that in the former scenario whereas now I have to accept the situation. And being here I know I would give anything in the world for that choice right now, I'm so glad I was wise enough to look past his tiny flaws and  fill my life with moments of the absolutely wonderful loving man he is (was). Be vulnerable, take risks, get hurt, it's part of being a human and it's ok. As long as you're not being downright stupid, harming yourself or those around you irreparably and not being codependent enabling someone's flaws rather than accepting them, it's ok to make mistakes, that's how we learn and grow. And on the chance that it's not a mistake, the potential upside is limitless.\n\nIn the comments of my original post, a lot of you wrote that you cried and told your SO you loved them or gave them a random hug much to their surprise. I'll admit that those comments made me happier than anything else. That our story could inspire some bond somewhere to get stronger was the greatest compliment. So I request anyone reading this to do this today. Give your SO that surprise hug, tell them you love them. I wouldn't wish what we went through on my worst enemy and I'm still glad I got that time. But most of you won't. THIS time is that time for you. I'm sorry that for most of you, it will be sudden/painful and prolonged. Living your life like each day is your last is impractical. But living your relationship like each day is your last is the easiest and most comforting thing in the world. Hug them, hold them, tell them you love them... Cheers to all the love in the world.\n\nThank you all once again. \n\n**tl;dr**: My husband passed away, this update is to thank all of you for your wonderful advice and support\n\nEdit 1 : Thank you once again Reddit, for all the overwhelming response. Thanks for all the tears, all the hugs and all the support. Thanks for the PMs offering more support. And above all, thanks for our story helped make a difference in your life. I'm so grateful to each of you who's vowed to work on their relationships and love their partners more. I'm trying to reply to each one of you kindhearted folks, apologies if I have missed out on anyone. Thank you for being with me in this time. Your thoughts, prayers and support means a lot to me.\n",

It was the best night either of us can remember in the last year.  Thanks again OP.",

            "I'm so sorry for your loss, OP. Glad to hear you made what time you had count.  One thing I wanted to throw out there about the stars (I did the same thing for my sister before she passed, because she and I used to joke about them) The place we went through offered things where you could have the name and star coordinates engraved. I know it's cheesy, but we did necklaces for the kids (my daughter and my nephew were 8 at the time) and my mom, and we did Christmas tree ornaments for all of us (because Christmas was her favorite). Well, the necklaces are long since gone, but the Christmas tree ornaments... There's a nice moment of quiet and reflection each year when we hang them.  That's not to say we don't think of her often, but it's been six years for us and it's not quite as in-the-forefront as it used to be, and we all seem to find that extra moment of thinking of her every Christmas comforting.\n\nI'll say a prayer for you (positive thoughts, if you prefer).

            "Thank you for the post!  I'm in a similar situation and have been looking for more ideas of things I can do to comfort my partner and close family before I am gone. \n\nWhile I don't have a specific timeframe (such as a month, 2-months, etc.) I have been back on chemo which started in July 2014 and will remain on it until it stops working or my body can't handle it (it's really unpleasant to have to go in every other week and be out of commission for 5-6 days after each cycle for over a year). Recently it looks like it may be close to that point; although I'm hoping it isn't.  My diagnosis was a couple years ago and is stage-4 metastatic colorectal cancer (with a specific mutation which makes it particularly difficult to treat as it doesn't respond to targeted treatments that have been researched yet).  Following a major surgery and hospital stay, and after my first time on chemo a couple years back, things were good for a little until it continued to grow and spread to the point of having to go back on treatment last year. \n\nI really don't have a fear for myself when my time is up. My biggest worry is my loved ones I am leaving behind and making sure they are alright. It's really difficult seeing and knowing how difficult this is for my mom to see me going through this as well as my significant other and my mom's partner. We are all very close and I really want to make sure I can do things to help them before and after I'm gone. \n\nI've already been doing some of the ideas on this list and am continually looking for anything else that might help as well.

I'm sorry I can't mention all of you here. Please know how much every word meant to me.\n\n.\n\nHere's an update of all the things we did end up doing (and I hope this will help someone else like us out there):\n\n\n1. As suggested by a lot of you, **pictures and videos.** I have loads of data of him doing his daily chores to just snoring away next to me. And I still don't think it's enough. Do this, you may not have a warning, you may regret it if you don't. A little background of me here, I've always been anti pictures, I would proudly say make memories not photo albums and that if something is important enough, you'll remember it. While I still stand by that to a certain extent, I do condone finding that balance. I would charge my tab, turn on the camera and put it in our room. So I could enjoy him and then re enjoy our moments later. And we made the heavily suggested naughty videos as well. Fair warning, getting closure is important so don't get drowned in these memories either. It's too soon for me but I do understand the risks and will look out for myself. \n\n2. Which brings me to my next point. **Discussing the future.** As much as one would want to avoid thinking about a life beyond the one they love the most, not thinking of it will make it that much harder when it inevitably comes. Here's where all the advice on being practical was executed. Practicality on financial and emotional fronts; financial being having ALL the financial information including account numbers, passwords, life insurance policy details, wills and any debts and the latter being arranging for a therapist and talking about expectations from a partner after one is gone and discussing the kids futures, if any. He documented all the financial information and verified it twice, taught me how to access his bank's site and wrote down a step by step guide on how to get the insurance money once he was gone. He wrote a letter addressed to my \"next spouse\" with all the not so easy to discover things about me that were wonderful and necessary, in his words. \n\n3. **I wrote a book about him.** I'm an aspiring author and I'm proud to say that the love of my life is the sole reader of my only book. \n\n4. **Scrapbook.** This was so fun! I collected screenshots of the best and meanest things we've ever said to each other, printed those, interspersed those with our pictures over the years in chronological order (starting with the cliched obligatory baby pictures), threw in a few lists I wrote out of top 9 dates, top 9 best sex, top 9 reasons I love him (both our birthdays fall on 9th) etc., mixed in a crossword puzzle he had to solve and our scrapbook was ready! \n\n5. **I named a star after him.** I know this is slightly silly but now I can look at him whenever I want. \n\n6. Needless to say, **indefinite time off work**, spent every waking moment in his arms and sleeping moment in his tightly wrapped arms. Yes, lots of cuddling and just being together. \n\n7. **Balcony picnic.** This was an excellent idea. Stars, candlelight, good food and some good old fashioned open air sex \n\n8. Speaking of which, **lots of sex**. \n\n9. We discussed with his doctors and **freezing his sperm was not a possibility** at this stage so that couldn't pan out. \n\n10. **The last life party**. I wanted to call it The party that never ends but he played the cancer card so I was shot down. All his friends and family came over, everyone said a few things about and to him, nobody was allowed to cry, I told them I was spending a lot on the funeral and he was stealing my thunder by being a tear hogger. It was actually pretty nice with gag jokes from his goofy friends, something like a Halloween with a ghost attending but he's friendly like Casper rather than being creepy/scary \n\n11. **Told him I loved him, constantly**. And anything else that came to my mind that I wanted him to know! He was quite a sport about it and returned the favor. \n\n12. **We played cards together**, watched football matches and his favorite shows together. Things he loves. Casually holding each other. \n\n13. **Festival week**- a day designated to all the festivals. Milestone birthdays- video recording for each with a message \n\n14. **Cooked his favorite meals for him.** He was my happy helper. He'd wash the tomatoes and I'd make the lasagna. He called me the food conjurer. \n\n15. **Made him wear his favorite shirts** for several days so now they'll smell like him for some time. \n\n16. Knit him a sweater, made a portrait of his \n\n17. Things very specific to him that he wanted to do- a small bucket list that I won't bore you with\n\n-----------------------------------------------------",

I have made friends with other young widows many who lost their spouses to known terminal illnesses. They had the chance to prepare and they didn't... I am so glad to hear that you did.\n\nThe next 6 to 12 months of your life are going to be hell... The best advice I ever got was just get through today, and if today feels too difficult then just get through this hour, and if that feels too difficult then just get through this minute, and if that's too difficult then just breathe and don't worry about anything else. \n\nHopefully because you had the chance to prepare with his support your journey will be that little bit easier.

He got cancer 2 years ago and died 6 months ago. \n\nI did many things to help him and was there 149% through his chemo journey that was fruitless.  \n\nThe thing I did for him that he appreciated most was that we have a farm that is 100 acres, and he walked around it every day.   When he got so sick that he could not walk, I cleared a path around the farm wide enough for his little Toyota Rav4 to drive around, fixed all the mud holes that would get it stuck, and all the trees that would touch it.... I cut the limbs and cleared the path.  He drove it every day. \n\nWhen he could not drive any more I hauled him and his oxygen tank to the car and drove him around the farm to see the animals and the creek every day that he felt able. \n\nYou'll never look back with regret on the kind things that you do for a person that is sick and dying.  You are going to be here many more minutes or days than they are.  Giving them the best you have to offer is wonderful and when they are gone you can look back on those good things and it helps you heal. \n\nI'd pave a damned road around this farm if I could have him back for one more ride.

I love thee with the breath,\n\nSmiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,\n\nI shall but love thee better after death\n\n-\n\n\nI think your story is the most appropriate one I have ever seen for this poem.

You ended your husband's life with many memories, memories that you'll have for the rest of your life.  It sounds like you guys had a beautiful life together.  ",
            "This was absolutely beautiful. I am so sorry for your loss but so happy you two got to make the last days so meaningful. Those are memories you will cherish for a lifetime. <<hugs>> ",

            "I'm very sorry for your loss, OP. But I'm so happy for you to have had that time together. That is so special.\n\nWhen I was in my teens, my stepfather was diagnosed with cancer and passed away four weeks later. We tried our best but it was so sudden and he fell ill so quickly that we didn't know what to do. We had time to get his legal and financial affairs in order, but I wish there had been more photos and videos taken, more time spent together, more last memories made, more of *him* left behind. The only thing worse than my grief and regret as a daughter was watching my mom lose the love of her life. That's a whole different world of pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone.\n\nFor that reason, I am really, truly happy that you were able to do this. I missed your first post, but it makes me feel better anyway to know someone out there benefited from experiences like my family's and was able to make the most of the time they had. You handled a horrifying situation with incredible grace. Your husband passed knowing that he was loved more than anything and that you had the tools and strength to face what laid ahead. It's a beautiful story and you are a beautiful person for taking all the steps you did. Thank you for sharing it with us.\n\nThe coming weeks will be tough. After the rush of the funeral and all the formalities, a quiet seeps in and the adrenaline that's been keeping you going will run out. I'm here if you need someone to talk to, and I'm sure there are plenty of others here who would be happy to do the same.",

Thing is, if you really love him, after he's dead, that's all you'll have. And you'll get sick of seeing the same shit, with nothing new ever forthcoming. Always the same pictures that you memorized, same videos that you know like the back of your hand, same memories and no one to reminisce with.\n\nTake time to talk. Think about what matters in life and talk about it - family, children, humor, holidays - whatever matters you the two of you, and talk about it. You don't have to go anywhere, or do anything, or make \"epic\" memories, because the most epic memories, if you really love him, are memories of being together, at home, doing nothing. Memories of what you had that didn't *need* anything or anyone else are the only memories that matter, and you can't get those in your inbox. You can't make a meme out of those. You can't get fake internet points (karma) for those.\n\nGood luck.\n\n",

I have horrible health anxiety (panic disorder) and regularly worry about dying, or my husband dying, and how I just wish/hope/pray we live until we are old. Meds help me not fixate on it so much, but it's still there, always in my mind, that I have to die.\n\nI know, deep down, that even though the average age of mortality is in the late 70's, there are always, always people at the lower end of the curve. I think about how so many people don't live a year and pass away as babies; I know that sounds morbid, but it reminds me that we are all on borrowed time, nothing guarantees a long life, and that we have to try and lead the best life possible since we only get one. So I hug my husband all the time. I smooch him all the time. Not passionate-sloppy-sex kisses, but kisses on his nose or neck or cheek. And he kisses me back. And we hug and hold each other. If I die tomorrow, I want to know I kissed him and told him I love him as much as I possibly could. And I want him to know that too. And if he doesn't make it until next month, I'll know we lived together as much as we could, and we got a month longer than some people. \n\nI hope you can heal from this, and find love again, and live a long life full of hugs and kisses. I am so sad for your loss but so happy you had that month. <3 ",

It has gone a long way to helping me see that there good people out there and  that hopefully one day I'll be able to meet a woman like you guys and hopefully before that day I can make myself worthy of her love.\n\nI hope you all find peace and happiness.  Keep each other close.  It seems we will all loose the one we love eventually but I hope it's in many years during old age and that the pain of loss is a fair price for the happy lives you have had together\n\nSorry I've rambled a bit.  I'm really quite affected by your story\n\nPeace ",

I am truly sorry for your loss. \n\nPlease know everything you've done, including coming back with your update and thank-you's, is a testament to your inner-strength. Then add in how you've touched and inspired so many others with your heartfelt words during a very dark time...you're truly an amazing woman. Much love and many hugs to you.",

It is common sense stuff that seems to get overlooked.\n\nAlso being in situations like these teach you to learn what is important and what is not... really quickly. Just communicate and be nice!

My fiance has been diagnosed with terminal cancer in April 2014 and I am very lucky as he has been battling this war bravely till now. Things are getting worse and previously we had been in a long distance relationship where I was 9000 miles away from him. But I'm glad that I made the right choice, and temporarily dropped everything just to spend enough time with my fiance as every moment counts. \n\nWhen the day comes, I hope that I'll be able to cope with it gracefully like you did. This post was beautiful and your list did give me some ideas on what to do. \n\nAs I'm typing this, he's laying in bed with headphones connected to the TV while I'm typing away and having tears welling up in my eyes. I'm going to give him a good long hug. It's hard to not end up crying, but I'll try.\n\nMy prayers and thoughts are with you at this darkest time. Sending all my love to you. Take care OP."

My husband thought I was suicidal and I had to go to an impatient facility and I was so angry. Angry and him for asking me to go, angry at the doctors, I was really convinced nothing was wrong with me, I hated being there. \n\nFor what it's worth I think going to a facility and getting on medication saved my life, I know now looking back how irrational I was behaving. Your husband is in a place right now that will be hard for you to relate to or understand but with the proper counseling and maybe medications you both will be in a better place.",

I\u2019m glad you at least know what\u2019s going on now and can take the next steps to move forward from this, and hope you and your family are doing as okay as you can right now.",

Sorry also for my reply to your earlier post suggesting he might be seeing someone else. His behaviour was so odd and out of line that that seemed like a possible explanation. Psychotic illness is a terrible frightening thing to go through, I hope you both can get some family support through his hospital stay and recovery. ",

It wasn't nearly as bad as what you're husband is likely going through, I didn't need inpatient care, but I was also aware how stressful and frustrating my problem was to my wife. She's now dealing with her own anxiety and depression that was brought on by feeling utterly helpless to do anything for me.\n\nWe're both getting better but it was a very hard time and you have my sympathy and support.

She was on the verge of divorcing him and taking custody of their kids because she feared him. He was threatening to kill himself whenever she COULD get ahold of him, he\u2019d spent all their savings and announced via FB he was \u201cmoving to Paris\u201d, etc..\n\nHe was diagnosed with bipolar at age 30. He eventually came down off his mania and went into a deep depression, it took many months to get back to even semi-normal.\n\nHe agreed to medication and therapy and has been doing fairly well since, with only a few minor issues since then.\n\n\nI hope you and your husband can work things out for him. He\u2019s going to need a lot of help, patience, and support. Best of luck to you both.",

I finally left him when he attacked me while I was holding our 6mo son. \n\nIt actually turned out he had a brain tumour, that had caused the erratic behavior and escalation. I just thought I\u2019d mention this, please get your husband checked just in case it\u2019s a physical problem that can be treated.",
            "I read your previous post yesterday and while people were saying he may be cheating on you, I honestly kept thinking it was a secret drug dependency or mental illness.

Actually, the partner I was with at the time couldn't handle it and left.\n\nI was in and out of hospitals throughout my 20s. Eventually, I got on the right medication, worked my ass off, found a great husband, and I'm living a normal life now. I haven't had symptoms for over 4 years, maybe 5. I have to admit that I still come off as a little eccentric once you get to know me, and I'm a little self-conscious about it, but that and a bit of anxiety at night is really all that's left of the illness.\n\nI have bipolar disorder. In about 20% of cases people make a near-full recovery. I will probably be on medication for the rest of my life, but I'm a pretty happy person now. There's hope.",

I\u2019m just telling you that there is always the possibility of recovery, but not to expect it.  With the right medications and the support from loved ones, it sounds like your husband has a good chance of recovery.  If anything, I\u2019m proof that it is possible,  after my break, 5 years later, I got my RN license.  Hang in there, and if you have any questions, feel free to PM.",
            "Just to give you some advice from someone who has been exactly in your shoes. My Husband found it very difficult to bond with our Daughter when she was newborn. He was terrified but trying to hide it. He then wouldn\u2019t emotionally bond with our Daughter or me for about 12 months. I just kept hoping it was temporary. We then had a huge row and he stormed out and took a mini break down at his mums house. He was in his 30s at this point. Looking back I can see all the signs and excuses, I even spoke to my brother in law in confidence because he was a mental health nurse, I told him I suspected there was more to his depression and anxiety, he started to see the signs too. My husband put down to mood swings or exhaustion. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.\nIt\u2019s not easy but if they get the right help and support it can become well managed. At the slightest dip in mood or excitement building I immediately call his specialist. He\u2019s really stable and his \u201c normal \u201c self again. One piece of advice as a family, discussing mental health is so important. If you broke your leg or had flu you would talk about it. Well mental health is a health issue so it should be openly discussed rather than the embarrassing secret that nobody talks about. Also you weren\u2019t to know this was the problem so don\u2019t hold any daft notion of guilt about it. Most importantly you need to look after yourself so you can be strong for him if he needs you. You need support too. \nI hope your Husband gets a diagnosis and gets a good treatment and team support. Most of all try not to project into a future you can\u2019t predict. Take each day and each hour as it comes. Sending thoughts and prayers your way x",
            "I\u2019m so sorry to hear this and can imagine how overwhelmed you must feel. Please rally and lean on your support group as much as you need. Also please be sure to have your husband checked out physically, if he hasn\u2019t been already. Ask his doctor about a brain scan to rule out any brain abnormalities that could cause such a sudden onset of a mental illness (with psychosis) not usually seen in men his age.",

If I might make a suggestion, you may want to look into seeing a therapist yourself while you're working through this. It's going to be a long road ahead for both of you, and having a therapist may help you to work out how you're feeling about everything, since I know you're probably feeling a lot of different things right now. It just might be helpful to already be seeing a therapist and having them know the situation so when there are rough spots ahead, you have someone to talk to and get ideas for how to work through it.",

            "OP, I'm so sorry you're going through this. I can't imagine what these few days must have been like. \n\nMental illness does not need to be a hard road. Sometimes it is. Many times it's not. Many people have undiagnosed mental illness that affects them and their family for a lifetime. It's good that he is being treated. Whatever he's diagnosed with can be managed with patience (from him and you), the right medication, awareness, and therapy. \n\nI suggest you get a therapist, even if it's just to process these events and what your family is going through. This kind of sudden change is traumatic. You'll need support and a place to process everything and start building an understanding of your husbands diagnosis / symptoms. \n\nJust remember: it'll be okay. If your husband takes care of himself after discharge (staying on the right meds, for instance), and you take care of yourself as well, you can both lead a normal, happy life. What happened is scary, but it doesn't have to ruin you both!\n\nBest of luck! ",

            "I know this is a difficult moment in the both of your lives. Mental illness comes with its challenges but it also has a hidden beauty not everyone sees. It brings you guys closer if you work together and remember to be kind to yourselves and to one another. I've been diagnosed with depression, and ocd. I've come to find stability in my flat has been my biggest help. Having a sanctuary and know there's love there. You can be part of that for him. Journaling is also extremely helpful in helping reduce stress when life feels overwhelming. I don't know what he's particularly dealing with but if you ever need an ear or some advice don't be shy.

Of course be supportive etc, but perhaps talk to your own therapist, or a support group. Ask for help. There's no reason to throw your own health down the drain! (Not saying you are, it's just an easy trap to fall into). There's still stigma around mental illness so take it one day at a time! ",

One had a breakdown exactly how you are describing - he got irrationally angry and started demanding sex, then demanding they adopt a dog (!?) then full blown panic attack. My girl friend was terrified of him but managed to drive him to a psychiatric hospital and he was admitted for 10 days. During that time it came out that he had previously been admitted unbeknownst to any of our friend group. He also refused all help and medication as he was convinced people at the hospital were out to get him. \n\nMy story doesn't have a happy ending, but I write this to say to you that it is amazing that your husband is accepting help! It sounds like he is taking medication and this isn't a small thing. I bet getting back to you and your child is motivating him to get better.

He wasn't doing himself or her or, my brother and myself any favors by not giving himself a chance to breath.

I'm sorry to hear that you are all going through this but hopefully he will get the help he needs. \n\nYou need to be prepared for the fact that he might not be the same person. I am not trying to scare you, but unfortunately I speak from experience. In those two days he could have done any number of things that normally he would never do. He might not remember them. He might endanger you and your child. This is not to say that's the case, merely that you need to take those possibilities very seriously. I would urge you not to fall back in to comfortable routines when he returns, even if that feels most helpful in getting back to normal. He needs to get tested and be seeing a psychiatrist and adjusting meds very regularly, and you need to come up with a plan together for how to identify symptoms and work together as a team to keep him well, if that's the best for all of you.",

He took me around the city, we tried all kinds of food, had honestly the most fun I've had since I was a kid, made memories off of little moments, I didn't think that much of it. I realized that the whole day had basically been an all day-date, I knew it had to be coming and I had the ring with me and I was going to try and propose at the same time (someone suggested this in my original post and I thought it would be cute) \n\nHe opened my door, walked me down a beautiful pathway and just looked me in the eyes and I said yes. He laughed and dropped down to one knee and I started crying and forgot that I was supposed to be proposing too. I don't even remember what he said, he was on his knee for a while saying what I'm sure were the sweetest things, but I was too busy crying. I'd already said yes before he even got down on one knee so he put the ring on my finger.\n\nWe went home and and I realized I didn't propose, he wanted to shower and we sometimes shower together so I proposed to him in there. He smiled and said \u201cI wonder if when our first kid is born will it top this moment\u201d then because I was on my knees in the shower he had to make a sex joke \ud83d\ude02\n\nAfter we got out he held me while we called his parents (I'd already called my whole family in car ride home) \n\nYesterday was amazing and now I'm laying next to him while he plays video games and he's talking about our engagement to his friends and I couldn't be happier and I don't know how to contain all this and just ugh! I love you Nathan!\u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone congratulating us! I appreciate it very much \ud83d\ude0a\n\nTL;DR: He took me on a romantic all day date and popped the question. I was supposed to propose at the same time but was too busy crying form happiness, I proposed to him in the shower when we got home\ud83d\ude02 I'm overjoyed right now!",

        "selftext": "Update to https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cmu75w/my_30f_husband_32m_impulse_bought_a_dog/\n\nThank you all for the thorough responses. I read every comment you guys sent.\n\nA few months ago I read a post where a woman sat down with her husband and outlined everything she takes care of at home in a list format. Like, kitchen: trash, dishes, wipe counters down. Etc. That way of communicating really stuck with me and when we went to see our therapist, I used the same format to express how much I do for the dog.\n\nMy husband told me that owning a dog was a joint effort and since I\u2019m home all day it shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\n\nWhich is when I realized that has been his excuse for everything. Cooking, chores, cleaning. I\u2019m not sure how I became blind to it. I don\u2019t know when I started bending over backwards to accommodate him.\n\nWe used to be a solid couple who helped each other out. I remember when I was still in school he\u2019d come over to my apartment and clean the whole thing for me during finals. Or he took care of my elderly cat when I was away for a week and a half. He used to help me dry the dishes and it was always fun. We used to have so much fun and laugh all the time. At some point it all stopped.\n\nI started crying right there in the middle of a sentence and he got concerned. I\u2019m not a cryer the only time he\u2019s ever seen me cry was when I had to put my beloved cat down a few years ago. But he held me for the first time in what felt like months and we had a serious heart to heart about how he made me feel. Not only with the dog but how stressed I\u2019ve been with my job, how lonely I am, I don\u2019t feel important and how we don\u2019t feel like a team anymore, that I\u2019m worried about us.\n\nI guess it clicked for him because he really stepped up taking care of the dog. He started going into work earlier so he can come home early and hang out and make me dinner. It happened slowly over the course of the last few weeks and the routine suits us a lot better. We hired a trainer to make sure we can understand the dog\u2019s boundaries together and the dog sleeps in a dog bed. Our bedroom life has slowly gotten back to where it was when we got married. We\u2019re watching our favorite shows again and going out more. I\u2019ve been putting my foot down more about my feelings and he has been receptive. We are still going to therapy for now. \n\nAs for the dog, we\u2019re going to keep him. Is he a No List dog? Yes. But is he a good puppy with a big heart? Yes. We have the money to afford him and he took off after training. It\u2019s nice having a dog again.\n\nTL;DR: husband and I went to therapy, we talked through our problems, we are giving our marriage the time and attention it needs to mend. We\u2019re keeping the dog.",

            "Good job on the communication. Things can sneak up on people and unfair routines can creep in. I'm glad that you two seem to be correcting course for your relationship and it's a big positive that he's putting in a lot more effort now.",

            "Congrats on the progress!! \n\nPro tip: clean Puppy\u2019s skin folds with a baby wipe every other day or so... they start building up yeast in them, which is why so many bulldogs smell funky.",
            "This is awesome. \n\nYour story about the dishes made me think - my dad used to always say that the rising divorce rate was caused by the invention of the automatic dishwasher.  When he was growing up, many couples would stand at the sink and wash up the dishes together - one washes, the other dries/puts them away.  That was a time for talking and connecting in the evenings.\n\nI know that's an over-simplified idea, but it made me smile to think of him telling that story.",
            "I got teary reading this, so happy for you guys (and the dog!).",
            "Glad that things worked out with you guys. But you have to pay the dog tax. :)",
            "I wish more endings happened this way, usually not the case. I hope things work out with the pup! I advise on getting him insurance now while he\u2019s young so any health issues that arise are covered.",
            "This made me so incredibly happy to read. I\u2019m so happy for you guys and that this experience with the dog was able to open both your eyes to the larger issues at hand. I\u2019m a huge dog person myself and I see all the issues the bulldogs but omg are they cute and super friendly. Good luck and I wish your puppy a long and happy life with you two.",
            "Hello, I\u2019m so happy with the update! \n\nI am the owner of a bulldog. They are hard work and the health problems can be overwhelming, but there is a lot you can do to help their quality of life. Frequent walks, lots of exercise, wiping out wrinkles, etc. If you are worried about breathing, there is a surgery you can have on them to open up the nostrils and help them breath better. My parents had a bulldog before I was born and she was a happy and healthy dog who lived to be twelve. Good luck!",
            "It's amazing when you find the exact thing that you have been trying to put your finger on to say \"this is what is bothering me\" and suddenly the other person gets it.  It doesn't make one a winner and one a loser. It makes both a unit again united against this hurdle that is an obstacle for both of you now.  I am so glad you posted this.  It makes me realize how much I take for granted in my relationship.  Thank you!",
            "Glad you\u2019re keeping him!! As a vet tech who has seen the medical bills of bulldogs I would highly recommend getting pet insurance for him while he is still a puppy and has no pre-existing conditions, it will save you a lot down the line",

            "I'm glad that you realised what was happening, and I'm super glad that he realised he needed to step up his part to not lose you.

            "I just stumbled upon this thread and I'm dying to know, what did you name your dog?\n\n\n\nI'm also not only glad for you to patch things with your husband, but glad you kept the puppy if you can afford to tend to his needs. It's never cool to spring a huge (living and snorting) responsibility on someone like that, but it would be sad to think of him going to a home where the folks aren't prepared financially or have the time to take care of a pet with needs outside of food and poop baggies. I hope he rewards you with many years of love!",
            "I'm glad it worked out for you ! and despite the health issues the dog will have it's better living with a family who cares and will allow for surgeries to make life easier for the dog. just please make sure he sticks to his word ! and also, you gotta pay the puppy tax !",

            "Thats great! Sometimes insensitivity and selfishness isn\u2019t from being a horrible person, it can just be from being in your own world a little too long. Its great that he started to understand his actions and words and is doing what he can to make things better.",

Very painful. \n\nI recommend Pets Best Insurance for your pup (no affiliated) because they cover examination fees which are a good $80-$100 at my vet excluding the cost of care! Plus I\u2019ve never had an issue getting reimbursed. \n\nAlso would suggest getting an Embark DNA test done as it comes with an extensive health panel. It give me a lot of peace of mind when I got it done for my rescue pup!",

We got the muttiest mutt you could find. She's a little bit of everything. Six months in she started limping, and licking herself, and chewing herself and having belly problems... My dear mutt has severe allergies, both skin and stomach are affected, and congenital luxating patellas. \nWe had been taking her to our regular family vet but after two years of trying to get a handle on her health we finally sought out some specialists. \nNow our girl has her own allergy/dermatology doctor and an orthopedic surgeon. It's not cheap like the family vet but it's been game changing in regard to her overall health and well being. \nThe dermatologist switched her food to a salmon based diet. Her skin, ears and belly have never been better. The ortho said our girl DOESN'T need patella surgery. She was born with the deformity and she's living with it okay. Unfortunately we did discover she has a torn ACL in the right knee so she's going to have that fixed on the 9th. \nI could've saved my family so much time, grief and in the long run, money if we had just sought out specialists first. Thankfully everything is settled for her finally and we're on the road to a full recovery.\nGood luck with your baby, it's rough but my goodness is it fulfilling \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99",

He tried to get me to post-pone my trip and even tried to give me money to make me less mad at him. I told him whatever we had was over as I could no longer trust him. He cried which made me feel weird. I wished him and his ex the best and ended the call. \n\nI went on my trip and had a top class time. The Reddit community really astounds me sometimes. I received a lot of PMs of suggestions of things to do and see and the trip to Ireland became a trip of a lifetime. In Dublin I did meet up with a very kind Redditor who showed me around the city and came with me to a bunch of museums during my stay. I saw amazing sights, met a bunch of really cool people through my travels, and met a few really cute Irish boys. (;\n\nI learned a lot about myself on my first solo trip abroad. I am pretty self reliant and I did a lot of self reflection. This \"relationship\" was my first \"serious\" one after my ex and I split up. I think in my desire for closeness with someone I ignored a lot of red flags and downplayed my self worth. I am now focusing on making real connections with people I meet in real life and have decided to stay away from anything long distance indefinitely. \n\nMy first night in Belfast I did message him after I had had a what was probably too many beers (damn you delicious Irish beers!) and he said he was sorry but it was what it had to be. It didn't really seem sincere and it extinguished any romantic notions I had. \n\nThank you to everyone who commented and PM'd me. It really made me excited for my trip and it was the best time!\n\nTLDR; Online BF backed out but after some logistical rearranging I still went on my trip and had the best time ever.

It's a huge red flag because he should have been over the moon that you were coming! Instead he tries to get you to cancel? WTF?\n\nBut glad that there are some thoughtful people out there who stepped in and helped make your trip a good one! :)",
            "Ireland is the best! I was there for 6 months this year and would take any chance I could get to go back, so I'm glad you went and enjoyed it!",
            "Love your courage to end things and take that trip anyway! What an inspiration!",
            "This isn't the first time I've seen Redditors meet up with each other and I'm honestly relieved that most of the community are genuinely nice people <3 Wish I had joined earlier on!",
            "This happened to an acquaintance. She had been talking to him for a good year I think before heading to Ireland for him to cancel during her entire 2 week trip. Imagine if it was the same person.. ",
            "What IS IT with Irish men? I dated one long distance from England for 3.5 years. I'm sharing this hoping you might feel better about dodging his fuckery and doing exactly the right thing - how awesome is travelling alone!? It's just the BEST I hope you manage loads more fun trips. Congrats congrats congrats!!\n\n\nSo we'd meet up multiple times a year, every couple months. He was the first person I texted with anything, we were in constant daily contact. Ok, there were some really unusual aspects to it as we weren't monogamous, but when whatever changed he just decided to ...ghost. Only did it really badly.\n\nLike I had a trip booked, and he kept insisting he was depressed and just not feeling up to replying, which was totally plausible as it was a big issue for him but obviously made me really really worried. I was checking for obituaries and news stories, as he lost a friend to suicide during our relationship and we were together when he got the news - so yeah, I believed it. \n\nI didn't want to put pressure on him, tho I usually stayed in the house with him & his mom so I booked hostels in Dublin to hang out with a friend there instead (and got trashed, went to one of my favourite museums, took a day trip to Newgrange & Tara and it was great fun - COS WE ARE SMART AND AWESOOOOOMMMEEE). \n\nWhen I landed he was still swearing he would meet up but I haven't heard from him since I said I'd be passing his town on a certain day and if he wanted to meet, I loved him & was available.\n\nYeah. A lot of British men are similar, never talking about their feelings, but I thought I deserved a bit better after 3.5 years. Not even a goodbye! I tell myself the kindest thing, if he was so messed up he froze (it was how he handled stressful things he didn't wanna face, just shut down, didn't think I'd become one of them) then i should just carry on.\n\nKeep him blocked too, I got a weird phone call about 10 months later which I could narrow down to his region. Yeah, if you were wondering? I'm ok without you.",
            "Okay, so let me get this straight. You've been in contact with this guy for 5 months, you fell for him and he fell for you. A week before you were supposed to meet him he canceled because his ex-GF was in a horrible car accident. Though without knowing whether this is true or not, you make a post on Reddit in which you ask for advice from strangers.\n\nNow you say you've tried being supportive to him, but in the end you care about that you will be alone in a new country? You care about the arrangements you made and the money you've spent? You think he betrayed your trust while he clearly has not. And you made a decision based on some assumptions and advice of complete strangers.\n\nSince you don't know whether he is lying or not, let's assume he is speaking the truth. So imagine that this guy just heard that his ex-GF, a woman which he shared 4 years of his life with, just had a horrific car accident. She might be his ex, but maybe he still cares about her? Maybe she is dying or might be dying so he wants to be there for her? Do you have like zero empathy?\n\nHonestly, what kind of human being are you? You clearly care more about yourself than the guy. You also assumed he is lying, but you expect him to put trust in you while it is clear you have put no trust in him. It's just utterly disgusting behavior from your side. He definitely dodged a bullet, because I am pretty sure you would have made him miserable.",

            "Fuck yeah. You won in this situation. So many people would have canceled their flight. Traveling alone is the most liberating thing. Good for your for not letting him shit on your parade.",

            "Good decision girl. Ex's has nothing to do with both of you anymore and this is why we let our partners cut off all the ties with an ex tbh. Even if friends? Nah-uh for me. At least you had a nice vacation, he just lost a person who was willing to exert so much effort for him, you deserve better than that. ",
            "I am so proud of you! I had gone through a similar situation about 3 years ago, although it was just across states and not countries. \n\nThe immense growth and worth you\u2019re going to find within yourself is going to be amazing. I am so proud. :-)",

My ancestors are Irish and my dream trip is to take a horseback tour of the island and the castles. Looking in to it I found it more affordable than I anticipated and while it will still take me several years to make the dream come true I am feeling inspired! \n\nI\u2019ve been going through a horrible time (on leave from work, severely depressed, etc) and looking at the pictures online of my dream trip makes my heart ache with wanting.
