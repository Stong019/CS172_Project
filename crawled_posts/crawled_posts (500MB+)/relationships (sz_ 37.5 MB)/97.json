        "selftext": "Hi Reddit. I apologize for a wall of text, but I feel like I need to write everything out to vent my frustrations. So, here we go!\n\nSo last Saturday, my boyfriend whom I've been dating for 5 years had a threesome.. We're very protective of each other, and we've had our fair shares of having someone chasing us or trying to get at us, but we've always remained committed. We always tell each other everything, and yes, we do get jealous a lot. A couple months ago, we watched porn together and stumbled upon a threesome video (M/F/F), and we thought it was pretty hot. A couple days later, he asked me if I wanted to add some spice to our sex life, and I said yes because I wasn't aware of what he had to purpose. He asked to have a threesome and mentioned we could hit up a bar and pick up a girl. At first I didn't feel comfortable having my man to share with someone else especially in bed. The thoughts of him fucking another girl just made me feel..exhausted and frustrated. But he kept begging me for months, and I reluctantly said yes. But we decided to come up with rules, and we were both to follow it up and promised it's the first and last time having a threesome. \n\nSo here are the rules we (mainly me) came up with: No kissing, both women have to have equal attention, no anal, and she can't stay after. He agreed and we watched some more threesome porn to give us ideas. Then last weekend came and he decided it was finally time to get it done, so we hit up a bar and talked to some girls. Well, we didn't straight up ask them to involve in a threesome. Then I noticed my boyfriend disappeared for a good 15 minutes or so, and when he came back, he asked me to wait in the car because he got someone. I was very nervous, and he brought her along to the car. We did the introductions right away, and I noticed that she was very plump. Although my size and proportions are among the average, she was obviously much plumper, bigger, and thicker.. On the way back home, my boyfriend was very bubbly and excited.\n\nWe decided to check in at a motel that was close to the bar as in \"no strings attached\" type. Once we got our room, we decided to wash up first and stuff. Then my boyfriend approached me first and started making out with me which was very hot. I forgot that \"Anna\" was there and out of nowhere, she grabbed my boyfriend away and put his face between her breasts and started undressing him. I was shocked. Shocked that she made a sudden move like that and shocked to see him sucking her breasts while she was undressing him. I started feeling uncomfortable right away. The next thing I knew, they undressed each other, and she was going down on him. I had to undress myself (I still can't fucking believe it either), and I joined her to blow him. Then he ate us out, and I noticed that he was very into her large breasts, constantly rubbing the tits or squeezing it. Then let's just say that he was fucking her most of the time, and I was just next to them force-masturbating the whole fucking time. He did do a few strokes with me, but he quickly scrambled back to her. Then she started riding him while he was nibbling and sucking her breasts and at one point, I pulled out his penis out of her to give a signal that it was my turn, but he BATTED my fucking hands away and continued with their fucking. And of fucking course, she moans like a fucking whale. I just can't stand it anymore. I felt fucking embarrassed and disgusted by watching them mainly fuck while I had to sit out and force-masturbate myself. Like this wasn't our fucking deal. So I just quickly put on my night dress and left. I don't even think they noticed me leaving...\n\nThen I left and I peeked through the windows (our room was on the ground floor) and the curtains were kinda swept sideways and sure enough, they were fucking kissing and she was riding him. I felt so fucking disgusted and betrayed. I ended up sitting in the car for an hour and went back to the room and found them sleeping naked. He had his hands over her breast and shit, and I didn't want to slide into the bed. And I fucking ended up sleeping in the car (yes fun) and headed back into the room in the morning and found her blowing him. I yelled at her and told her to get the fuck out of the room and she crossed the line. She got pissed and left, and HE GOT PISSED AT ME FOR RUINING 'THE MOMENT.' We ended up fighting big time, and I told him that he was fucking her most of the time and crossed the lines and broken our promises. He was just hysterically yelling and told me things like that can happen during threesome. I just grabbed my keys and left and haven't talked to him since then. He called and texted many times, but I felt disgusted and fucking betrayed. At this point, I don't want to continue this relationship with him or even talk it out with him. Should I just break it off without meeting him or just break it off after talking it out with him?\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Had threesome with my boyfriend and he just fucked another girl for most of the time and broke our promises. Should I talk with him beforehand and talk it out or should I just break it off without meeting him?\n\n**EDIT:** He just stopped by my apartment and banged on the door asking me to speak to him. He sounded like he's been crying. I think he fucking finally just realized that he fucked up.\n\n**EDIT 2:** We did lay out our rules and restrictions before sex. We didn't jump into it right away without letting her know what's allowed and what's not.\n\n**EDIT 3:** I don't know if they fucked again throughout the night without me since I slept in the car. But I wouldn't be fucking surprised if they did either",

            "So your Casanova boyfriend gets a random girl from 0 to threesome in 15 minutes after a whole 5 years out of the dating game? I would put serious money on him already knowing Anna and planning this together.",
            "|**and she can't stay after.**\n\nEven if you were to buy the excuse \"things like this can happen during a threesome\" the fact that he let her sleep there and never once tried to figure out where you went to I think seals his fate.  And then he has the balls to yell at *you* when you walk in the next morning and they're still at it?\n\nIt's way more than breaking rules.  It's breaking trust, it's hugely disrespectful, and after 5 years it shows you how he values you and your relationship.  ",
            "I'm very sorry about your situation, but this is like the best r/relationships \"threesome gone wrong\" post I've ever read.   This should be the yardstick against which all future failed threesome posts should be measured.  Seriously though: He badgered you into this, then used you and was an inconsiderate ass about it the whole time. Break up with him and find someone who respects you.",
            "So shortly after you finally agree, he manages to set up a threesome with a complete stranger he just happened to find in a bar. She acts possessive towards him, and he ignores you and your deal. He's being sketchy. ",
            "Wait, was there like... a condom involved? Cause all I keep thinking about is how you said he pumped you a few times and then went back to fucking her.... like you got all your junk all mixed with hers. Go get a test, dude. For reals.",
            "I'm usually a lurker here, but this post really got to me and I feel the need to say something. I'm furious on your behalf, OP. If I were you I wouldn't even hesitate to dump his ass - I can't imagine how an SO could do anything more hurtful, inconsiderate, and selfish. I'm so sorry. You deserve someone who treats you better.",
            "He totally ignored your guidelines he agreed to. I would dump his sorry butt. He basically used your \"threesome\" as a guise so he could cheat.  he continued after you left, and let her give him a blow job without you around. No excuse for that. ",
            "It kind of sounds like this is not the first time he's fucked her. \n\n* He begins pressuring you for months and finally talks you into it. \n\n* You go to the bar and together, you both really don't know how to approach women about it. But then, he disappears for 15 minutes and suddenly knows how to ask a women he's literally just met to have sex with him and his girlfriend- who is no where in sight, right now in a nearby motel. Personally, if some dude approached and propositioned me under those terms while alone, I'd run the other way. \n\n* she wastes no time just grabbing him and going for it. You'd really think three people who just met and have never had a threesome before would be a bit more cautious and nervous. They fucked eachother while you watched from the side. You even got swatted *away* from being involved. It sounds like he tried to create the perfect plan: he would get a free pass to fuck someone because you knew and were there. How could he be accused of cheating if it was 'just a threesome with a stranger'. \n\n* he either didn't notice or didn't care that you left and never came back. Both of those options are inexcusable. And then *he* got mad at *you* for being angry that this stranger was fucking your boyfriend the day after the \"one time\" threesome. He then didn't even care or STOP fucking her when you got angry and left. \n\nI'm sorry but that is just the ultimate betrayal- how could you ever trust him again or have feelings of resentment towards him? ",
            "If you're going to break up with him, why waste your time letting him try to convince you to stay?",
            "Sounds like he wanted to just fuck someone else. I'd drop the jerk.\n\nHis breach of the agreement is blatant cheating. *In front of you.* There is no respect in his actions.\n\nThere is not much to talk about, IMO. He was heartless and completely put himself before your relationship.\n\nRemind yourself that he's trying to make you look like the asshole after all this too.\n\nYou could have run off and hurt yourself yet he just kept enjoying himself with this woman. That's pretty fucked up.",
            ">But he kept begging me for months, and I reluctantly said yes.\n\nYou should have known it was shady simply because he was begging you for a 3some. ",
            "I can agree to every other comment here about better hurrying and leaving him immediately. \n\nI've never been as emotional as I am, with a reddit-post before.\n\nReading this made me imagine the scenario and it made me so emotionally upset. So mad and upset that I was about to cry out of anger (sounds weird but I can totally feel you).\n\nI wouldn't be able to stand that.. I feel so sorry for you, I wish you best of luck",
            "My opinion? I think he was in it for the long con. I think he manipulated you into watching that porn hoping it would plant a seed of interest in you. He nagged until he got his way and then happened to pull a girl on a night out at a bar just like that? It's all a little but too convenient.\n\nI think he's obviously been flirting with this girl before. I don't know whether I'd go so far as to say they'd slept together before this event, but I think he saw her, wanted her, and with your hesitant permission, got her.\n\nI'm not one for break ups. I think many relationships can be fixed if you work through them. But this? This is sick. He manipulated you, used you, and cheated on you with someone he's probably had prior with. Honestly? Leave and never speak to him again. ",
            "Batted your hand away... Holy shit ",
            "HE SLAPPED YOUR HAND OUT OF THE WAY. HOLY SHIT .",
            "This got me mad after reading it. One thing after another, it just got worse. He broke the kissing rule, the no staying after rule, the equal attention rule. Geez I really hope he didn't do anal. \n\nSorry OP, no advice it's up to how you feel :/ this just made me sad/angry/hurt as if I were in your position. Do update if you stay or dump him :) good luck",
            "Breaking the agreed-upon rules aside, you left the room and didn't come back all night and he apparently didn't give a shit.  Even if all had gone according to plan but you had a change of heart and left, a caring partner would have made sure you were OK.  This guy is a shitheel.",
            "Break up with him. He pressured you into something you weren't up for, and then used it as an excuse to basically cheat on you while you were there. He broke the rules. You break up with him.",
            "You disappeared for the entire night and he didn't look for you. Fuck the fact that he ignored the rules you guys agreed upon prior to the threesome. He didn't fucking care that you were gone when you guys were at a shitty (guessing) motel! It's fucking dangerous as hell!",
            "You didn't have a threesome, they had a twosome.",
            "He is inconsiderate at best and a lying cheating bastard at worst. Closer to the latter. At least a \"normal cheater\" would have the cowardice to hide it but he just did it in your face...What a terrible human being.\n\nI'm livid just reading about this. I'm so sorry this happened to you and like many others have suggested, I'd dump his ass. He deserves no mercy and you should break up and go no contact. \n\nHe will also likely spin this as if it's your fault for being petty. Don't listen to his false words. You would have done the right thing by leaving him forever.",
            "He broke the rules and your trust in him.  This is by definition cheating.\n\nIt is entirely up to you how to proceed.  If you can't stand to look at him then the relationship is over for you and you should move on and find happiness.\n\nIt sounds like you have made up your mind on this.  Normally I would suggest hearing him out, but that may cause more harm than good in this case.  He wanted to fuck someone else and he wanted you to condone it.  From your story he didn't seem to care about your feelings and dismissed them.  Lesson learned, move on, be happy.",

            "It straight up physically hurt me to read this. Fuck him. You don't need that. He cheated on you, he rejected you, and he made you feel like 2nd best. ",
            "What a fucking betrayal. He seriously pressured you into this and told you whatever you wanted to hear just so he could fuck someone else. \n\nHe's going to act sooooooo sorry, he's going to cry and tell you he can't live without you. But please, please please please, remember sleeping in the fucking car (how terrible!) Remember him choosing her over you again and again. Remember how you were able to LEAVE during the \"threesome\" and they didn't notice (this means it wasn't a threesome!) This wasn't a mistake. It didn't \"just happen\". This guy has 0 accountability skills. Remember him being DISMISSIVE of your feeling until he thought he would lose you. Do you want a partner like that, who will trivialize your feelings unless you threaten to leave? \n\n\nYou deserve so much better. My heart hurts for you. This is a nightmare. Dump his ass and find someone who respects and cherishes you. Not someone who will toss 5 years aside and set boundaries for random sex. Jesus christ. \n\nGood luck OP <3 I am so sorry. ",
            "Just to give you an idea, I started crying while reading what you describe happened, and imagining I was in your position.\n\nI would be beyond pissed and heartbroken if my boyfriend did that. I would've started bawling on the spot.\n\nHonestly, he has no respect, and this type of behavior doesn't deserve a second chance. It's pretty much like he just cheated on you *right in front of you* and tried to blame you for it. You do you, but for me, I would never want to speak to him again.",
            "You know my bf wants a threesome with either a MFF or MMF and, this story makes me not want one. I'm so sorry you have to go through this. Don't get back with this guy. He sounds like an ass hole! He crossed and ignored every rule you two made. ",
            "He cheated on you.\nThis was all about him having sex with another girl.\nThere was nothing about your pleasure involved.\nHe broke your ground rules you two agreed upon.\nI would feel gross and pissed off too. Text him to pick up his shit.",
            "This is some shit that will traumatize you for a while even if you do break up.  I am so sorry.  This is awful.  This guy is pure barf.  \n\nYou need to get away from this dude and like cleanse yourself emotionally.  I don't know how you do that really, but take care of yourself and don't give this fool the time of day.  Ugh.  Vomit.  I hope you have a few friends you can turn to.  \n\nAlso I want to edit this and add that I get the strong vibe he knew this girl beforehand.  Which makes this all the worse...",
            "Yep, no coming back from that. Don't take him back OP. Stay firm. Trust me, I speak from experience, these images are *burned* into your retinas. You will never unsee it. They will pop up at random times when you're with him. He'll propose, and that shit will flash through your mind. You don't deserve that. Get a new start and never think about this again. Also next time, you should know that you're a firm monogamist and that seeing your SO with another girl will make you uncomfortable, which is 100% OK. A decent boyfriend won't beg you for months to do things that you're uncomfortable with.\n\nStay firm and update us.",
            "Break up with him. He just,wanted your blessings to cheat on you in front of you. I couldn't get over it. He fell asleep with her. Wtf? Don't let him use \"I was wasted\" as an excuse. ",
            "He didn't say it but his actions clearly spoke \"Fuck your rules.\"\n\nSounds like he didn't want a threesome, he just wanted to bang another girl on the side.  Idk if I should call this cheating or not but the fact remains that you were neglected, disrespected, and betrayed in something you set clear ground rules in. He has no excuse. Dumping him is well within reason. He begs for a threesome and then had a gall to break the clear set rules. He obviously doesn't think much of you. or the relationship. \n\n\"It was in the moment\" is no excuse. You clearly tried to engage in it more yourself and got smacked away like you were some dog getting into something you weren't suppose to. \n\nThis was never about a threesome.  It was about banging a girl guilt free. It barely started as a threesome, but it definitely didn't end as one.\n\nLet him cry, let him be sad. Show him that him using and disrespecting you for a one night fling  just cost him a relationship. Don't bother trying to make it work and set ground rules to earn trust back because he just showed you that he won't follow any rules you set. \n\nAnd if he throws out the \"but you agreed to a threesome! \" shit say something like \"yes, I did. But we didn't get a threesome. 'I' didn't get anything except for being yelled at for wanting some intimacy while YOU got to fuck another girl and completely ignore me and the rules I set. I agreed to and threesome. You seem to have thought I agreed to you just fucking another girl. You clearly don't have respect for me so  going to find someone who does.\"",
            "That wasn't a threesome, that was some sort of weird pseudo-cheating-loophole that you were suckered into. Honestly, I would leave. He broke the rules! Plus, if you tell each other everything, why did he persist with asking about the threesome (knowing how uncomfortable it originally made you)? Regardless of whether you stay together or not, ask him about that woman. For him to break your rules and ruin your trust after five years.... I don't know, it seems like maybe he's known her for a little while.",
            "Your last update was 4 hours ago so I hope I'm not too late and I hope I am not one of those inbox messages that get buried. Just leave. I am a 31 year old male. He just lived out a fantasy, but if he was in love with you, you would have been the primary girl in that situation. \n\nPlease go with your intuitions. I never listen to mine and in the end they are always right. You really don't need any advice but other than that of listening to yourself. Just listen to those intuitions and you will be better off. Yes it will hurt but it will hurt more if you don't listen to them. ",
            "**He cheated on you, right in front of your face.**\n\nHe broke every single rule that you had agreed to, not only did he cheat on you but he did it right in front of you.

If you guys live together then you'll have to have a discussion about the logistics of breaking up. If not, making a clean break will be pretty easy to do.",
            "Honey, I feel you. What a fucking shitty night. He's an asshole. Sounds like he just want an open relationship for the sake of not having to fuck you all the time. Throw him out unless he comes up with something extraordinary. You sound like a good person, and him too - the latter only until the the most ultimate trust test, in which he failed miserably. \n\nI hope you'll be alright. ",
            "That was pretty hard to read.  This is what scares me away from threesomes.  I would not go back to your boyfriend, you are still really young, and can find better.  You will find someone that will treat you equally in a threesome(if you choose to do it again).  He set a clear message that he doesn't mind breaking some rules in sex, he sure as hell will break other rules.",

Should I just break it off without meeting him or just break it off after talking it out with him?\n\nHard question.  If you think this might be fixable, then sure, talk.  But if you're set on breaking it off, I'm not sure why you *need* to talk to him.  Unless you think it might give you some closure, or if you just want a chance to yell at him some more.

I would feel like I'm betraying my girl if I so much as touched the other girl. But that's just down to personal preference I suppose.\n\nGood luck to you and I realize it will be hard to break off a relationship that has lasted this long, but trust me, this will pass and you will move on.

You then confronted him directly after the sex and he still failed that one.\n\nSure I can believe that he was just 'caught up in the moment' and 'lost control' and probably doesn't genuinely have feelings for her, but I personally wouldn't want to be with someone who has so little self-restraint and would be so inconsiderate of my feelings and wouldn't even do anything *when I've left the room* (either he didn't notice, which I highly doubt, or he noticed but decided at the moment that his dick was far more important than you, your feelings, and your relationship combined). If this is how little self-restraint he is able to display *while you were present*, what in the world would happen when you weren't there?!\n\nIf he gets a chance at all, he better be grateful and do something very, very extravagant and long-term and sacrificing for him to regain your trust.",
            "He clearly used the threesome as an excuse to fuck someone else. If you're not okay with an open relationship, I don't know how you could erase that mental image. ",
            "Wow, OP, internet hugs...\n\nIt doesn't seem like you're asking the question \"Am I overreacting?\", which is good - because you shouldn't be asking the question, because the answer is unequivocally \"NO you are not overreacting\".\n\nHe kept pestering you for months, despite your reluctance, and when YOU gave in to HIS fantasy, he basically discarded you and disregarded your feelings.  It was, needless to say, much less about you guys having a shared experience, and more an excuse for him to fuck some new pussy.\n\nYou know what the rest of your relationship is like, but from my point of view, I can't imagine how little I must care for my SO's feelings if I were to do anything like that to her.",
            "Jesus.  This will be buried, but break up with him.  I've had threesomes.  The first one was with my very serious girlfriend during my early twenties.  We had talked about it for a long time, set out rules, etc., but never pursued it.  When it fell into our lap it was a girl who came onto both of us.  I would never have done it had my gf at the time not been into it completely, and the girl was at least as much into my gf as me.\n\nInitially I tried to keep to our no-kissing rule, but that was tossed out by the girls.  The rest of it was great.  But it was inclusive.  Everyone into everyone, and my relationship at the center.  My girl was the important person.  I didn't even have sex with the other girl until my gf suggested it.\n\nTbh, it still caused problems in our relationship.",
            "I saw the title and thought of stopping by just to add something like:\n\"You're young. Find a new boyfriend, and keep a threesome in your \"record\". That's cool. I wish I had one when I was younger and had less responsibilities, just for fun.\"\n\nAnd now that I see that you had no fun at all, I'm really sad and disgusted. I'm sorry you had to go through all that, the experience sounds really awful. You'll get over it, don't worry. Give it time to heal, make peace with yourself and move on. \nI can't really offer you advice, because if it were me, I would never wanna see his face again. Damn, I'm angry. ",

            "I'm super late to the party here, but I hope OP does read what I write.\n\nI am an experienced swinger, and have had many threesomes.  The thing that is needed beyond anything is trust.  If you aren't ready to see your SO kiss someone else, you aren't ready to see them fuck someone else.  A lifestyle decision takes a long time to get comfy with, lots of talk about boundaries and rules, and about respect of each other.\n\nMy first threesome was with an ex who agreed anything was a go, as long as a condom was used and she left after.  We met people for coffee, in clubs, but NEVER had a surprise meeting in the car or anything like that.  We always talked about the people we met, and then decided if they were right.  You need to vet out if someone is truly bi, or just wants to fuck your partner and cut you out (because as you just saw, it does happen).  It needs to be about the both of you.  The third is just an object, a sex toy that you watch each other play with.  This didn't happen for you.  Emotions were high before the clothes even came off.  You also need to be able to remove the emotional attachment from the experience.  It NEVER goes the way you picture it.  Sometimes it goes better, but often your first time with this thing it is awkward as fuck.\n\nYour BF broke your rules anyways, although I think you made a lot of preparatory errors the lead to a really shitty time, his actions show that he was in it to fuck another woman, and it wasn't about \"you two\", it was about \"him\".  His next step will ask to \"play alone\" and then he'll do it anyway.\n\nOnce the experience falls apart, he should have stopped with you.  This is the biggest flag that this is bullshit.  You don't keep going if your SO isn't enjoying themselves, you end it there and talk about what went wrong.\n\nI've been in the lifestyle a long time, and heard some pretty horrific stories.  Couples who failed to properly communicate and execute expectations rarely last long, and most of the time after an experience like this, will break up due to trust and respect issues.\n",
            "I'm so angry for you right now. I see no reason for you to forgive him or continue this relationship. He clearly has zero consideration your feelings and your safety. ",
            "There is no way you should go back to him. Frankly, you weren't even comfortable with it in the first place and you should of never agreed BUT since you did go through with it very important information was revealed to you about him. You cannot ignore that information. He shit all over you, complete disrespect just for some pussy. As a guy myself I will tell you even without knowing you at all that you don't deserve that. He deserves a nice kick to the nuts. Get yourself away from that selfish douche, take care of yourself, start doing all the things you dream of, make life what you want it and find a guy who will respect you and only wants YOU. Seriously. The only reason he was so excited about this threesome was because he was getting the chance to fuck someone else which means he is BORED of fucking you. Advice, find a guy who isn't addicted and/or doesn't watch porn. Porn turns guys into mindless sex freaks with weak self-esteem and insecurity. Find a guy who is only interested in real women in the real world because if you don't then guys who watch porn will always try to bring their fantasy into your relationship and you've experienced what happens when you attempt to do that. You'll never live up to their fantasy and you'll end up hurt just trying to do so. You shouldn't try to become someones fantasy anyway. You are a real person, what are you doing trying to bring his sex fantasy to life? If you aren't good enough for him as you are then you need to ask yourself what the hell you are doing with him. ",

This has got to be the first /r/relationships post that made me enraged to read. I would dump him immediately and tell him to fuck off.

Then he goes and breaks the rules you had set down while completely ignoring you through the experience and gets mad when you react. I personally would end the relationship. I also agree with others that say he had this girl set up before you guys went out. Sorry this happened but at least you weren't married. ",
            "The last straw was already when you were leaving and he didn't immediately stop fucking her. Break up and don't ever take him back. \n\nI'm sorry this happened. You must be devastated that this happened after a 5 year relationship. But there really is no way of salvaging this, he absolutely betrayed you. This goes as far as being cheating (continuing after you left). ",

            "I have had enough threesomes to know he already had someone in mind and that he was never going to respect your rules since he never cared nor noticed your discomfort. \n\nI am bisexual and if my partner ever just presented me with anyone with whom they sealed the deal with prior to me having met the intended to see if I was attracted to them, it'd be called off on the spot. So your situation sends up immediate red flags. They almost ignored you basically from the start. That's not a threesome, that's a twosome. He more or less cheated on with you in the room. He also vilolated your rules which is a clear violation of trust. I won't tell you what to do with your relationship but I can tell you that threesome was a thinly veiled excuse to fuck another woman. Had you been a man that would have been cuckolding you. That was not your intended reason to have one. These and similar situations are the reason why clear communication should be made prior. \n\nI can also tell you that testing the waters prior to penetrative intercourse is something I personally recommend. Threesomes are and can be enjoyable but trust needs to be established by all parties  if this is a new thing in an already established relationship. I don't know if you'll ever try again but I have had some really fufilling, amazing, dirty sex that will give me memories that will keep me warm at night for years to come. Sex can be great if everyone in any situation is enjoying themselves. He knew you weren't and I don't blame you for feel betrayed.  So impirically, I think you got the shaft, love but I wouldn't let that ruin your thoughts on threesomes in general. They can be amazing. I would, when you're ready, look at some forums for the best ways for you to enjoy yourself in that situation, have clear concise turn ons and offs before ever engaging again regardless of whom with and be prepared to stand up and say no when your consent and enjoyment are being ignored. I wish i could help you more. ",

I believe he likely already knew that other girl and once in the moment, decided he wanted all of the experience with something different that he could suck up while it was happening.\n\nThat said, because of your mention of the jealousy thing, this should have never happened. You were reluctant enough as it was, and after agreeing I'm sure you were still very unsure about all of it. The fact that you went along with it anyway shows that you had to at least care enough to be willing to try this even when you didn't want to.\n\nHis blatant disrespect for any of the guidelines you set up beforehand is a dead giveaway of his lack of care or concern for your feelings, especially after you broke down and gave in on something he kept pushing for months with you shooting it down. In all honesty, he would have likely cheated on you eventually anyway (if he hadn't already).

We just couldn't, just wouldn't; admit it to each other.  For a while, we blamed that one thing.  Those few encounters.  The fucking psychopath.  That was easy.  It was immediate and quick and decisive.\n    But it didn't matter who else was involved.  We'd long since given up on our relationship.  It was a ghost story, but a happy one.  With anniversaries and shared memories and the feeling of family.  But it was as real as a ghost.  And that led us to stupid things.  Hateful things that destroyed us inside.\n    Intimate relationships between two people are fucking hard.  They are the hardest thing we do as humans because they involve monumental sacrifices.  You can have friends, and be damned close, but there is a part of you they never have to see, and you can get the fuck away from them when it's absolutely necessary.  The intimate, committed relationship?  Not so much.  They fart in the bed?  Funny once, maybe five times-- if it's spaced out.  But at some point, in their mind, your fart is a direct attack on them.  And there are so many more, less funny things that become weapons in the space between two people.\n      That's the definition of hard, right there, negotiating that minefield.  Now, introduce another person to that intimacy.  It's an exponential weaponization of those intimate things.\n     I'm not a prude.  Not religious either, nor do I give a flying fuck about what lifestyle anyone leads.  But I do know one thing:  if you think you can take a relationship built on real love and trust through that valley of shit and emerge clean and somehow fulfilled, well, you're just refusing to say what's really on both your minds:  \"we're done fucking each other, let's have someone else pull the trigger on this\"...\n      I wish you well.  Just stay the fuck away from this guy.  It's done.",
            "You need to end this relationship, absolutely. He did betray you by essentially refusing to observe the rules you agreed to. More than that, he displayed a contempt for you in the face of another person.

            "Holy... shit...\n\nI'm so sorry for you and how these events unfolded. While I have never advocated such things, I know that some people (most notably Dan Savage) believe they can be completely relationship-healthy and can even serve to bring a couple closer together. Imagining that outcome for me is like imagining world peace, but it seems to work for him and apparently for some others. My point in including this is that I'm sure there are people who read a story like yours and think, \"Well she was stupid for thinking anything good might come of it, blah blah blah\". It might be rare, but it can work for some people.\n\nSo anyway, you feel betrayed because you **were** betrayed, at several points in the process leading up to it and during it. One of the huge factors with anything like this is that it takes both people having equal enthusiasm. He had to beg you for months to get you to agree, so you really weren't feeling it (there was nothing wrong with that, there are many things we might watch in porn or fantasize about that we have no interest doing irl), and the fact that he was willing to twist your arm was a huge red flag that it was more about what he wanted rather than thinking it was something both of you would enjoy.\n\nThe rules were a good call, and might have worked perfectly if he wasn't a complete selfish tool. This fact was further evidenced by his procurement of a third participant without your input prior to his approach (\"wait in the car because I found someone?\" Seriously? How about, \"Hey I think I found someone, she's over there, what do you think?\" Christ...). He had already made his decision on what *he* wanted, and expected you to go along with it. Selfish as fuck.\n\nAnd just at the point I thought he could surely do no worse than he had already, he let you leave. I'm sorry, but you were his girlfriend, and he let you leave the entire night while he shared the bed with another woman. It's not a threesome at that point, that's just cheating.\n\nI don't get the impression you're asking *if* you should break up with him, but how. I'd say it's time for you to be selfish: if it would give *you* some closure to talk to him and provide him the list of fuck-ups that brought the relationship to an end, then do that. If you're considering talking to him because of his door-beating tantum, or because he's acting like his poor widdle feewings are huwt, then don't, because he sure didn't give a damn about yours.",

            "He broke all of the agreements and completely disrespected you. Ditch him. You gave him a really cool gift and he couldn't even be kind enough to include you.",
            "Once he kept going once you left it wasn't a threesome anymore. It sounds like your boyfriend pushed you into the threesome to start with, broke every single rule you had, and then kept going once you left meaning it definitely wasnt a threesome anymore. In my opinion this was absolutely cheating and he had 0 regard for your feelings. ",
            "This just makes me sad, angry, and so sorry for you.  You need to never talk to this guy again.  He's trash.  How can some people be so cruel and terrible?\n\nPromise us all here that you will never talk to this guy again.  Unreal.",
            "Threesomes are notorious for breaking up relationships. Really, the only relationships that survive them are either entirely based on sex or incredibly mature. If you were uncomfortable enough with the idea to have rules in the first place, a threesome probably wasn't for you. \n\n\"Dump him!\" seems to be the rallying cry for people in this sub but in this case it's probably accurate. The relationship is most likely dead. You can't trust him, and he showed he didn't really respect you. \n\nAt least next time you have a threesome, you know what you're getting into. And next time, you should make sure your partner has also already had a threesome, so he knows how to behave. Threesome etiquette does exist, the rules are kind of redundant/unnecessary.\n\n",

            "This shit pisses me off. Dump this dick. ",
            "The fact that you weren't involved at all in picking the girl was a huge red flag right from the beginning. To be honest it sounds like he just wanted to have sex with someone else but under the guise of a threesome.\n\nHe broke pretty much all the rules you laid down which is a huuuge no no when it comes to sex. Dude fucked up big time. He betrayed your trust. You guys have been together a looong time but I think you should take a break from each other.",
            "OP I'm so sorry, my heart hurts for you ): I can't even begin to imagine what you're going through right now. But he doesn't deserve you. ",

            "This is why I can't understand why people want to have a threesome. Someone always ends up getting hurt whether it is physically or emotionally. Why are people so greedy that they want to have their cake and eat it too? I'm sure others can handle an open relationship, but I sure as hell wouldn't be able to tolerate it.\n\nDump him. Punish his selfishness and greed. You don't need this in your life. ",
            "Holy fuck...\n\nThen again I feel like this is something my ex would have done, except she would have broken up with me for being mad.",
            "This is the textbook case of threesomes ruining the relationship. ",

At least once you have the results, you'll be able to tackle the next phase of your life. Good luck.",
            "I'm so sorry it turned out how it did but looking at it as an outsider it's pretty clear that from the start this was his way of satisfying his craving of sleeping with somebody else but not technically \"cheating\" because....hey... you were cool with the idea! \n\nBatting your hand away whilst he was in the middle of things with her is the most shocking and telling thing about it all. It illustrates that this was all about his own gratification and you were just the one giving him permission to do it. To not even acknowledge you had left the room and to carry on with her in the morning is totally beyond my comprehension of what a boyfriend would do....was he totally wasted?!\n\nI can't really see how you would get round this in your relationship. He has completely shattered all the trust and respect you've worked on for 5 years.   ",
            "I know that you agreed to have a threesome so in theory you knew the consequences, but I'd be in the same boat as you. And I would break up with him. The fact you saw them kissing, she stayed and was blowing him in the morning and just other things you said makes it more like cheating because he crossed the boundaries you both agreed on. I'd really hate that feeling. Can you update us please? Good luck with whatever you decide. ",
            "I feel an update coming in the next few days",
            "It sounds like neither of you were ready for a threesome. Yeah, a new partner is going to be exciting and fun but you have to make sure that the established relationship gets equal attention!

I'd say hear him out but know In your mind that nothing he says can change your feeling on what happened. ",
            "This makes me so angry. I can't believe his nerve. That is so mean. If I was in your position I would want to talk to him so I could explain just how rotten of a thing that was to do and how rotten he is for doing it. I don't know about you but I wouldn't be able to move on without telling him exactly why he fucked up. You deserve so much better. I wish you luck in whatever you chose to do. Feel better.",

First things first this may be long and windy, I hope it all makes sense but I think just typing it out and getting it off my chest will help massively anyway. I need some advice on what I can do here and where I go - i need to keep my friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI met her two years ago when we worked together and quickly became very close. She helped me through the darkest times of my life (i was mid split with an abusive ex when we met), and I helped her through some really tough and unimaginable things. There were lots of rumours at the time we were seeing each other and everyone assumed we were an item, but for the past two years our relationship has been purely platonic - she is (was?) my best friend and up until a few weeks back I don't think we'd even ever hugged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to a week ago - she came over for dinner and wine, this is very common and normal. We had more than usual and she was over the limit so couldn't drive, so she stayed the night. We slept in the same bed but apart and no physical contact again, it was completely normal and just as expected. We somehow didn't get up and ended up staying in bed until 10pm the next day just talking. Sometime during that evening she got upset about something going on in her life, I rubbed her back while telling her everything will be ok and then we just cuddled - probably the first bit of real physical contact between us but nothing was sexual, didn't feel weird and she went home and it was all OK.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis last weekend we had a hiking holiday planned, where we'd be sleeping in her van (she has a converted transit). It's one bed but we thought we'd be fine. First night it was freezing, ending up cuddling and spooning but again didn't feel sexual. Second night is where it all went a bit wrong, we drank a bit too much and the spoon ended up getting carried away - it seems to be a joint thing and before I knew it we were kissing and touching each other everywhere. It was a bit of a frenzy of this for about 15 minutes until we both stopped and realised what we just did. After this we spoke a little and asked if either of us regretted it, we both said we didn't but it was odd. She got upset and I told her it was ok - it didn't change anything and we could just draw a line under it. We woke up the next morning and it happened again, we didn't talk too much but then went for a walk and then just before we headed home we ended up all over each other again, we were completely naked but again stopped, cuddled and lay there. We both agreed it was a \"what happens in X, stays in X\" type event.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was a really long trip home (6 hours+), during this she would rest her head on my, hand on lap ect and it seemed very different to our usual dynamic. When we stopped at services for breaks we seemed to walk arm in arm, we kept kissing on and off but it seems strangely normal? We arrived back at her home, she lives with her dad at the moment but just before I left she kissed me again and thanked me for a wonderful weekend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe following day (two days ago) she came over to get some stuff I took home with me, we end up just cuddling, kissing, feeling and so on again. We are on my bed and dry humping but she has dinner with a friend and we stop it there, she goes on her way. Two days later she comes over for a film and food - we had a lovely night, she ends up staying and we end up having sex twice. This should feel really weird and strange, but it felt completely normal and we both discussed it that it was so odd it felt normal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday she turned up unannounced at my place (which is not a normal thing) with coffee and doughnuts, we end up talking, cuddling, kissing again and then we end up talking about what this is - que the big problem. Neither of us were sure, she got panicky and burst out in tears and left. She said she was really scared and her words were \"I think I will end up pushing you away and hurting you and I don't want to do that to you\". I told her I would come and see her later and talk. I drove to her house but her ex was there, another slight issue. They broke up 6 years ago stayed close friends, he is a lovely bloke but in his head he is certain they will get married and have children. She's had the conversation with him but he seems to shut it off. If he found out she was seeing anyone he would get extremely angry, but there's so much family history intertwined between the both it's really complicated. For that reason she has avoided seeing anyone in the past 6 years. The reason he turned up is she hadn't responded to him since the night we kissed. I went home when I saw his car and just said she could come to mine to chat later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe turned up, sad and very emotional. She explained she ran off because she is terrified of losing our friendship, I said let's just cut the romance out, draw a line under it and be friends again but she seemed to not speak much when I said this. I asked if her ex was the issue - she said it was nothing to do with us but a whole other issue, but that was not impacting what was going on between us. We sat quietly, hugged and I tried to reassure it would be OK, and I wasn't going to start hating her for whatever reason, and I am completely fine with just being platonic friends again. We both agree and say whatever happens we stay friends and nobody gets hurt but we will pull back from the more physical side. This somehow ends up with us kissing? We kiss for a little while and I tell her she should probably go home and get some rest, but everything is ok. We get up and she helps make my bed, I give her a hug and open my bedroom door so she can leave, she then takes the door off me, closes it and kisses me - this then leads to sex and we have really passionate sex for about an hour. We get up, cuddle, kiss and she leaves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI woke up this morning really panicky, I have no idea where we are, where we stand and absolutely terrified of losing our friendship. I don't know what to do or say. I've felt sick to my stomach and can't eat at the thought of this. She is coming around later to collect some of her clothes she left last night and I am thinking I need a plan of what to say/do.I cannot lose my best friend - she is absolutely everything to me but I am worried we crossed a line and there's only one eventual outcome which won't be good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm super sorry if this is hard to read, but man it felt like a weight off my shoulders just typing this out. If there's a more appropriate sub for this I can post there instead\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; slept with my absolute best friend of 2 years, both now having serious panic issues and overthinking with not knowing what to do. I don't know what I want and I think she is confused too - what on earth can we do to try and protect either of us from getting hurt???",

Have you considered she might just have a crush on you, and that the fact that you seem to bring up the WE COULD JUST DRAW A LINE UNDER IT unprompted is actually really hurtful? Have you considered that the sex may not magically happen to the both of you due to an outside influence but that she might you know... want and initiate it? Maybe she was hoping that you would say that what is happening now is a wonderful addition to your friendship and that it will all be okay.\n\nYou want to preserve what is there, but you need to consider that maybe it has been different for her for a while now, and she does not want to go back to pining for you. What was there may well already be gone.\n\nShe's been your good friend for 2 years and you said the sex is also good. What's holding you back here about her? Is she not actually... perfect?

I went home when I saw his car and just said she could come to mine to chat later.\"\n\nUm...he's not a \"lovely bloke.\" Her ex is abusive and is stalking her, full stop. He's continuing to control and monitor her.\n\nTo be honest, if I had an ex who was routinely watching my every move and if I knew he would become enraged if I started seeing someone, I probably would be scared to date too. Her behavior makes complete sense to me given her past history (and her current history!) with this guy. She said he has nothing to do with you and her, but if he's stalking her every time she doesn't respond overnight, he has a lot more to do with it than she's maybe aware.\n\nI think maybe you should sit down with her and bring up your concerns about her ex, gently, and tell her you're there to listen. Ask her if she feels safe, if she wants help with the situation, offer her resources, etc.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if, if he was out of the picture, she would be acting a lot more comfortable and less hesitant/anxious.\n\nIdk dude, but to me it seems like the bigger issue isn't losing your friendship, but losing *her* entirely....this just set off alarm bells when you were discussing her ex.",

She wants a relationship, she's had a crush on you this whole time. If you feel the same way, stop telling her you are okay with going back to \"being friends\" (sidenote: you probably were never friends, she was probably trying to get close to you and you missed every signal until she straight up kissed you. Sleeping in the same bed isn't a big deal? Holiday weekends, sleeping in a car together?).\n\n\nHer ex is also abusive as some have noted. You need to stop \"having things happen to you\" and start taking charge of your decisions. Confront this guy with her and tell him to stay away. Get a restraining order against him and make sure you all cut contact. He doesn't get to influence her life. Tell this girl you want a relationship, or tell her you can't. Access your feelings. Step up and act. Also congratulations for potentially finding a great person who you really got to know well and seem to vibe with--I'd let that influence your decision because it is rare and you are lucky so do something about it!",

            "Your friend needs to cut the abusive ex boyfriend out of her life.  He has been controlling her relationships for 6 years? Really?

The recent events might be due to that illness. She obviously feels unsure about this new turn your relationship is taking. Might be because she feels like her illness caused it partially? I would dig a bit more into this and give it time.\n\nHowever the ex part is honestly not reassuring. This man is controlling and as you said earlier, she doesnt want it to be known when shes going online : i cant help but think it's because of this man. Its been 6 years. He's still thinking about marrying her and consider her as her girlfriend as the controlling part of his behavior is NOT something you find in any other kind of relationship. He needs to get out, he's obviously still trying to push his way into her life. I understand that the bond between her family and his is going to make things harder.

Everyone always thought we\u2019d end up together so it made sense in a way what was happening. But after 9 months of trying to figure it out I made firm boundaries because I felt like he would never truly commit to me (he also had an ex girlfriend of 8 years that he still had ties to and was friends with). We tried to be friends for another year after that but when I eventually started dating my now partner he ended up ending our friendship. \n\nAll of that to say: I totally feel you and it\u2019s really complicated navigating all of these feelings.

It became clear after a few conversations that he wasn\u2019t going to be with me \u2018at the moment\u2019 so to protect myself I created friend boundaries again and started to mourn that intimacy change, if that makes sense.

Women want you to tell them straight up what you want. You'd be might be shocked how women respond when you are confident and decisive. If your friendship doesn't work out after telling her what you want out of this, then she isn't really your best friend, because your best friend would understand even if they didn't agree.

He lives with her, he thinks they're going to get married and have kids, he's deeply involved in her personal life... she can't tell him who's she's with or if she's dating, she hides her activity from him. She's sneaking around behind his back one way or another.\n\nNow, he may well be abusive and this is the only way she can find an escape, hoping to find someone to save her from him (this is pretty common in abusive relationships, where the abused is so ground down by their abuser they basically cheat to find someone who can rescue them from the abuser, who can be their backbone and give them a place to run too - there's nothing wrong with this, sometimes we are just not strong enough to save ourselves). He may not be and she's just a sneaky cheat.\n\nI think if you want to go for this, you need to find out exactly what is going on with this guy, why he lives with her, what the real status of their relationship actually is etc. Because whatever the situation between them REALLY is, it is going to become your problem if you and her start dating.",

When you say you're cool with just being friends what she is hearing is that you are not interested in an intimate sexual relationship. She is worried about being rejected by you and never being able to go back to the way it was.  And she's right. It will never go back.\n\n\nSo, you need to make a choice now. Are you interested in exploring a sexual relationship with her? Because if you are, she is clearly done.  If you are not, you may lose her altogether unfortunately because she will be crushed and will probably withdraw from you, perhaps permanently.\n\n\nIf your romance doesn't work out, you do have a chance of being friends again.

And that you don't have to lose the special bond you have just because you shift the relationship to a new form. \n\nUnless you don't want to date her, in which case you should stop fucking her because it's obvious her feelings are deeply entangled here and she is going to get hurt. If you don't want to date her, I'm afraid to say I really think you need to take time away from each other until things cool down, and your relationship may never be the same after. \n\nGood luck, I hope things work out.",

I honestly can't tell from your post here. \n\nYou need to look inside and figure out the answer to that question before you do anything. Looking at your comments, you said you have feelings for her, in which case I think you need to go for it.

What she is afraid of is that she's taking advantage of you and your friendship to deal with her issues with her ex. Who btw is terrible. He sounds like a sociopath who doesn't care about her feelings or wants and only cares about himself and his own desires. It's particularly clear to me that he's terrible because he's able to come off as fine, even to you wto knows the situation well. Sociopaths are excellent at portraying themselves as \"good blokes\" when they actually suck balls.\n\nShe's really unsure of herself, which is scary in itself, and seriously damages one's self esteem. She's being stalked by a controlling ex, which is extra scary. She feels safe with you, she trusts you, so she turns to you to distract from her fear. And she hates herself for that, because she thinks she's taking advantage of you. \n\nShe likes you. But she is afraid of losing you because you are her support system. In her mind, her impulsiveness and dependence on your friendship will push you away.\n\nThis is a really tough situationb but if you can't tell, I've been in a similar situation before. The \"what are we doing?\" conversation was really scary, but here are the options we came up with:\n\n- we start dating, on the condition that he was fully aware of the baggage I was bringing into the relarionship and accepted that.\n- we stay friends while I work through my situation and try a relationship once I feel ready and can avoid dragging him into my previous, abusive relationship.\n\nWe went with the first one. Since he promised he understood what my situation entailed, there was never any resentment towards me for still working through the damage my last relationship caused. I never felt guilty for crying, venting, and relying on him whenever stuff eith my ex would come up. I can't imagine it was easy for him to see how much I was still involved in my last relationship and not fully dedicated to our new one, but he accepted that and made that clear to me.\n\nIn case you are wondering, we are no longer together. We got work on opposite sides of the country (US) and for a while communicated and hung out long distance, but he decided it was too hard for him and I respected that. Unfortunately, it was also too hard for him to just return to being friends and we've mostly lost contact. But I know for a fact that neither of us regret the time we spent together.",

Honestly, just go with it, you're close and get on well and you feel normal being sexual with her. She can't keep her life on hold because of some shit ex, and you can't try and rewind time even though there is NOTHING wrong with the fact you both consented to your actions.\n\nBoth of you need to stop being afraid of something that could be beautiful.

I had talked to my sister and close friends about it and they were like \"duh, probably a better person than previous relationships\" and they were right. \n\nAll of that to say, you've been friends with this person for two years - you guys obviously enjoy hanging out with each other.

            "Yeah man, it sounds like you two have a solid foundation to start something. Judging from your interactions and friendship it sounds like you guys are a match. It\u2019s weird because you\u2019ve only seen her as a friend and only a friend but since you two connected emotionally and now intimately, you have a bond that should be explored. Also tell her to cut that ex boyfriend off. Sounds like drama that doesn\u2019t need to be dealt with",
            "I think you should go for it, OP. It seems like you can't stop now, you both seem into it if it keeps happening. Please post an update!",
            "Sounds like you both want more but both of you are afraid to say it. Go for it. If she can remain friends with her ex for 6 years I think if you guys don't work out then being friends again is a total possibility.",
            "Don't live a life of fear and wondering what could have been, if this feels right to you then I think you should go for it, there's clearly something there.",
            "Honestly, that was a pretty entertaining read. By the sounds of it, you two have the makings of great relationship, or else the sex wouldn't have happened...multiple times! That tells me there's a spark that could work.\n\nThe only thing that has me worried is her saying she's afraid to hurt you (meaning she already foresees that it won't work). Listen dude, sometimes people are seasonal and you can't hold on to everyone forever. I would go for it with her.",
            "Almost identical situation happened to me. We went for it. Still at it 7 years later. Highly recommend dating your best friend.",
            "That ex should no longer have any say in what goes on in her life. Before you guys can continue even being friends, he needs to get out of the picture. Your friend needs to talk with him about her feelings and anxieties. Only then can you two begin to figure out what you want for each other.",
            "Do you want a relationship with this woman? She clearly wants one with you, but even beyond you not responding (ignoring? Rejecting?) to her advances, beyond having some adult fun, you are doing the *exact same thing* with every comment that points this out. The only one I saw you respond to was the one about the ex bf. \n\nWhy is that?\n\nAre you in denial that you are in love with her, or are to terrified to lose a great friendship? Or both? It's ok to be terrified, it sounds like you have something to be terrified of losing.\n\nIt also sounds like what she wants is simple: you. So you need to figure out if that's also what you want. Once you figure that out you can take the next step. No relationship? Well the friendship will be strained, and possibly over, because she wants one. If yes, then you will need to figure out how to handle the situation with her ex. \n\nSome people are commenting about restraining orders and such, but that seems *really* aggressive considering his relationship with her family and how little we all know of it.  It sounds like a delicate situation and well worth it to navigate if you choose to date her.\n\nI hope you do. It sounds like you have a GREAT foundation for a long lasting relationship.\n\nBest of luck!",
            "So I know you're getting a lot of attention on this, and honestly, I can't be bothered to read every comment, but I'm hoping you are. The following may have already been said, and if it has, take this comment as reinforcement. \n\nI take it that you don't have contact with the ex. And I take it you've talked about the ex situation at an arms length, and it's a touchy subject with her. \n\nI just want you to ask yourself, what and how would you feel if it turns out that she has been avoiding commitment with her \"ex.\" I put \"ex\" in quotations, because I'm concerned that her \"being nice\" is actually just her avoiding actually breaking up with her \"ex.\" \n\nYou need to figure out what that situation entails before you go forward. I can tell you and she both want to be in a relationship together. I simply think that she's scared to face hurting her \"ex\" by putting hard limits and saying \"it's over\" to him, just as she said she's scared of hurting you. I also think that she's scared of pushing you away because she's still in a relationship already. And I fear that she's afraid of telling you this because she's so interested in you. \n\nAnyway, that's my thought.",
            "Dude minus the ex being in the picture you\u2019ve got yourself a true love story. Go with it.",

            "The friendship was already ruined! But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Ruins can be gorgeous. Things can bloom in the ruins.\n\n  \n\n\n... I mean, ask her out, ya dingus. Y'all are obviously nuts for each other.",
            "It sounds like you are in friends with benefits territory. She likes you but is not emotionally ready to let go of her past and move on, or be in a relationship with someone. Ask yourself what you want and prepare yourself for it. Be prepared for whatever might happen. It's easier to know what to do when you already know what you want.\n\nThis reminds me of my ex-FWB. He was in a 7-year relationship that became unstable. They were on and off for the last year. We were best friends, but one thing led to another and well, you know how that goes. He wanted to try to fix his relationship and I supported him. It was a little complicated but I determined what I wanted out of our dynamic. Told myself to not get hurt whatever happens. Sure we had benefits but we also put our friendship first and respected what each of us wanted, even if it had nothing to do with the other one. Anyway, long story short ex-FWB is now my husband. His family has always thought that he'll end up with his ex, but after being together for over 10 years they've gotten over that too.",
            "Jesus Christ, did this guy break the friend zone?",
            ">but it felt completely normal and we both discussed it that it was so odd it felt normal.\n\nIt felt completely normal as if you were a couple instead of best friends. This is a good sign that you'd make a great couple. You both want to be more than best  friends with benefits. It's time that you finally recognize that you are already a couple. It's time to go out on a romantic date.",

            "I was almost in your exact situation. I'd become closer friends with a guy who had been married for a good portion of the time I knew him. I even went to his wedding! Then he was separated, and we did everything together. We could talk all night just by accident. We hung out with friends one weekend, stayed in the same bed and accidentally spooned all night both nights. It was scary to cross the line because we were such great friends; our friendship energised me, I looked forward to spending time with him and I didn't want to lose our connection as it was.\n\nThen one night we got drunk and it was like you described, we're kissing and then we're naked and the sex is so good. It keeps happening. I mean at every opportunity, we only break for work. His ex is angry with me, drama ensues.\n\nThat was four years ago now and we're still together, still best friends. I hope to get married to this guy. I say go for it but be wary of the ex, he is definitely a problem. Good luck!",

You love the friendship and you don't want to lose it. But I can tell you honestly that the people I know who have those relationships -- myself included -- are always glad they went for it. Being friends first is the best. You already love each other. The friendship part isn't going anywhere.",
            "It's pretty amazing being married to your \"absolute everything\" \ud83d\ude0a \n\nDont let it go away without giving it a true shot! She's probably panicking that you dont feel AS MUCH for her as she does for you. Let her know you do... it won't go back to platonic friends...it can go forward or fade apart with heartbreak and longing for what might have been.",
            "People don't handle indecision very well. That whole story you flipped back and forth from friends to something more. One of you seriously needs to pull the trigger. On anything. Stay friends or start a relationship. Whoever takes the lead here will determine the outcome. All this panic is because neither of you are committed to a path.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, for my opinion? Friends come and go. Spending the rest of your life with your best friend is a gamble I would take 100% of the time.",
            "Go for it man. You are already friends and you have sexual chemistry. Life is too short for \"what ifs\" so take the leap.",
            "I know you have a TON of comments and probably won't see this. But I just wanted to share.\n\nMy situation was not too similar, but I found that I was falling hard for my very close male friend. I was afraid of fucking it up--I felt only that a relationship would destroy everything, that I would hurt him because i was 'broken' (spoiler, I wasn't, I just needed the right person to help me open up and better myself), that I would ruin the bond we had.\n\n\"I'm afraid it'll ruin it.\" I said.\n\nMy other friend: \"But what if it doesn't?\"\n\nLong story short, if the connection between you is genuine and built on friendship, love, communication and good memories and caring for one another, the relationship will not ruin it as long as you look after each other like the friends you still would be. Boyfriend and I are now approaching two years together and we regret nothing; I'm so glad I took the leap.\n\nIn my mind it's worth the risk when your friendship is so strong.",

Tell her you value your friendship so much, and that's why it is the perfect foundation for a relationship. You know each other deeply and already have chemistry! It's beautiful, embrace it!  \n\nAs for the ex, if he is still yearning for her that badly, she needs to set some serious boundaries or cut him off.

Do what you feel is right for you; if that means talking to her about it and expressing your affection, do it. If it means addressing the issue of her ex and what that means for the both of you, do it. Just be sure to communicate your thoughts and/or concerns effectively. I hope it works out for the best!",

            "Well that's really strange.  Apparently I've never had a platonic relationship with a girl then, because massages and sleeping in same beds and even spooning would totally make me think of her naked, even if we never got to that part.\n\nAnyway, I'm glad you finally can admit to yourself that you're at least attracted enough to her that you'll take the opportunity for sex, rather than push her away saying, \"but we're friends only!\"\n\n\nSounds like she wanted something to happen but because you also kept saying \"no, we have to be careful of our friendship, let's not ruin things\" then she keeps pretending to agree.\n\nSo you need to figure out if you really just want to be friends or romantic partners. If it's friends, then quit kissing, spooning, and sitting close to each other that will give temptation for other things.\n\nIf it's romantic partners, then go all in and confess your interest and desire to see where this goes.",

He sounds super controlling to me and doesn\u2019t have her best interest at heart. It sounds like both you and her are obviously into each other and she needs to set boundaries with the ex. The ex could be what\u2019s holding her back and making her all panicked about taking things to the next level with you. If he gets angry at her finding love when they\u2019ve been broken up a long ass time then he doesn\u2019t deserve to be in her life tbh.",
            "Think about what you want out of this relationship.  You're cool with the two of you being friends again, but are you interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with her?  From the way it's written, it kind of sounds like she's the one who initiates the sex.  She says she doesn't want to push you away because she obviously cares for you as a friend.  I think you guys need to decide together what this is - and be honest about it with each other.",

But you haven't given her any affirmation of that on your end. And you haven't really told us much about how you feel about her and these changes other than there were times when it felt awkward and others when it felt good/normal. You have to try delving deep and do what feels right--to you, not to us and not even to your friend/girlfriend.",

You both seem to be comfortable with each other and that\u2019s the first requirement in a relationship. She also might have a crush on you but hasn\u2019t said so. It\u2019s not gonna go back to normal so I say go for it.",
            "Sounds like she wants to be with you. You mentioned she seemed a little upset about just going back to being friends. My guess would be because she wants to be more than friends but she either doesn't want to say it or doesn't realize it herself. \n\nYou also mentioned as she was about to leave your room the last time in your story here that she kissed you again and you guys had sex again. All this after you just talked about keeping it platonic. To me it also seems like you want to be with her too but there's something holding you back. \n\nI'm not an expert but I feel that if you guys do end up dating you need to set some clear boundaries. Especially with her ex. \n\nSeems like you both really like each other and would be very happy together. From my personal experience my current gf was previously a good friend. Eventually we were left alone at points and one thing led to another. I didn't really know what to think at first but then we had sex. After that I couldn't stop thinking about her. We've now been together for a little over 2 years.",

            "As a girl who (from what I understand) has been in the same position as your best friend here, I can say with confidence that she is in love with you but she\u2019s afraid of the emotional vulnerability. You are what she needs, because it seems that her exes gave her the wrong impression of what real love and passion is like, and I think what you have here with her is amazing. 100% go for it. In my situation, he persisted and slowly whittled down that fear of \u201cpushing him away\u201d and hurting him and I finally said yes and now we\u2019ve been dating for almost two years and it\u2019s been the best experience of my life.

            "Dude. Her ex is scary. It is not okay that she hasn't dated for 6 years because of him. \n\nIt is scary that he came over to her place because she didn't reply to his text. \n\nAdvise her to never be alone with him. \n\nOne day she has to tell him that she will never date him... And when she does that she must have witnesses and be prepared to put a restraining order him.\n\nAnd she likes you, bro. Go date.",
            "As many have already said, I'd say go for it. Sit with coffee, have a conversation about what scares you, but talk out how you feel about what's happened between you and how you see yourselves together. \n\nA similar thing happened to my husband and I before we actually started dating. We were best friends since 6 and 7 years old. Practically inseparable. We stood together through different relationships and a lot of ups and downs but timing was never right. Finally when we were 20 and 21 we both found ourselves single and all of a sudden in a more physical side of our relationship that we'd never experienced. It was weird, almost taboo seeming. But it also just felt right. It was natural and comfortable. Almost like it had been that way all along, but with all those great Sparks and fireworks. We've now been together for 7 years, married for 4. I'd confidently say that having a strong and healthy friendship before hand lays the groundwork for a good foundation in a relationship.",
            "The whole don't want to ruin a friendship thing is kind of pointless between people who are attracted in my experience as from what I see it gets ruined when they start dating someone else. I'd rather give it a chance.",

So don\u2019t tell her it will go back to before because that\u2019s not what she wants. \n\nTell her you want her, because you do, just that you are scared too. But that you are good enough friends that you can pull through it. \n\nThen screw like crazed weasels. Then talk some more.",
            "She's probably extra upset and confused because she may have been hoping you'd stand up and declare you have feelings for her and want the romance to continue.\n\nYou keep insisting you can just pretend it didn't happen and you're *totallyyy* fine with going back to being platonic friends. That could easily feel like rejection. She probably has strong feelings for you but won't admit them because you're not giving her a clear indication that you'll reciprocate or that any of it really means anything to you. So she just says she's confused. The crying, however, is a clear indication that her feelings are invested and she's feeling shaken up and in limbo. \n\nYou need to figure out if you have any non-platonic feelings for her.\n\nThe best relationship of my life started out as being just friends. We were friends and work colleagues for 6 years before anything romantic happened. He's now the love of my life and it's the best thing that ever happened to me.\n\nI see a couple of red flags with your situation though.\n\nNumber one is that you were able to cuddle/spoon all night and things like that with absolutely \"nothing sexual\" and zero sexual feelings or attraction on your part. It may have been very romantic and sexual to her all those other times. Also I have to question if you felt nothing sexual at all (like you may as well have been hugging one of your bros for body heat) then how did it lead to all this sex? Are you SURE you felt nothing romantic or sexual for her before the big move was made? Because the stuff you were doing leading up to getting sexual isn't exactly normal for 2 platonic friends to do. Is it simply because she is female and has a female body and she was just there so it happened? Or could it be, perhaps, that you actually do feel something more than just friends for her, and that's why you let it happen. Could it be that you push the idea of her being sexual out of your head because you know you have a good friendship and you're afraid of ruining it? Could it be that all those other times, yeah, nothing sexual happened, so you can say it was \"nothing sexual\", but maybe there were some feelings in there somewhere that were always pushed back? \n\nYou have to figure that out. It's not hard to figure out. Think about her and think about everything that's happened, the way it felt, the way she looks, her smile, her eyes etc. You will know if something is there or if it's just absent. Being panicky is not an indication that you don't have feelings, nor is being confused or unsure of what you truly want. You don't have to feel ready to marry the girl. You just need to figure out if there is something more there. Do you feel a pull towards her in a romantic and sexual way? It seems you do.. \n\nNumber 2 red flag would be her ex. That situation does not sound healthy, but I had this same issue as well. Though I had only just separated from my ex husband and was waiting for him to move out, it wasn't years after the fact. But yeah, exes equal drama. He's trying to stop her from moving on and she's not stopping him, which is a big problem. \n\nThe feeling I get is that she's very into you and that she's been consciously or unconsciously setting up situations where you 2 can get physically closer. I could be wrong, she might be just as shocked and confused about it as you, but some things you said about the entire thing point to her having feelings for you.\n\nShe may have been hanging on all this time waiting for you to to \"see her\". This happens for women *a lot*. I could be wrong but it's a super common scenario. So you have sex with her and you walk hand in hand like a couple afterwards, and she thinks... hmm I think he does like me back! But she waits for you to say something because she doesn't want to look like a fool. You say nothing, she says nothing... she starts getting really upset. But rule number one in the womens' book is Don't Chase A Guy Who's Just Not Into You Or You Will Look Like A Pathetic Idiot.\n\nShe probably secretly hopes you'll say something like... \"I don't know where this is leading us and our friendship is so important to me. I'm really afraid of compromising our friendship because what we already have means a lot to me, but I had an amazing time and I want more of you in that way. If you want to stay just friends, I totally understand, but if you want to explore more then I want to... either way, you have me as your friend and I care about you a lot\". But instead she got \"Hey let's put a line under it and just go back to being friends\", and you stressed that repeatedly. Because maybe you have nothing else to give and that's ok, you can't help that. Or maybe you're just a closed off guy who likes her but is terrified of fucking up a friendship because you associate being in a romantic relationship with things getting fucked up. Only you know how you feel.\n\nBut you need to have a really clear talk and either tell her you want more than just friends (if you find that you do), or tell her that you don't see her that way and you can only just be friends from now on. Then it will be up to her to state her feelings clearly as well.\n\nJust be gentle and considerate either way, because you've been the man in her life and she's been the woman in yours, whether it was ever romantic or not.",
            "I was in a very similar situation to you OP.\n\nI moved in with her initially without knowing her as a flatmate. Within the first week we became very close, it just seemed to happen so easily and naturally. We quickly became best friends and then towards the end of the year found it very hard to keep our hands off one another. But we tried. For a very long time too... While we were amazing together there were a few major differences at the time keeping us from potentially getting married and having children, and we didn't want to lose what we had so we tried to 'put a line under it'.\n\nIt didn't work. 6 months went by trying to be ok with it all and then ending back up in the same place. Having the same conversations. I was young and a little emotionally immature, and if I may, I seem to find a lot of familiarity in what you've written. I didn't know what I wanted, I wasn't acting with intention and I had an avoidant attachment style (look into it).\n\nIt got to the point where I realised I had to be in charge of the situation, so I moved out.\n\nWhat I realised from my experience was there is no going back. You can't 'just be friends' again and have it all go back to how it was. As much as I thought I could've done it and wanted it within my own mind.. I wasn't appreciating what she was going through in hers. She knew logically it wasn't going to work just as much as I did, but it was now too emotional for her and I just sort of kept dragging her through that. That honestly made me a little angry. That she wasn't choosing to help me in the decision and just being needy but I've since realised that was a rather immature stance to have.\n\nAnyway, that was almost a year ago to the day. I just moved back in a couple of days ago and I'm now sitting on her couch waiting for her to get home :)... turns out we couldn't do 'no contact' and have managed to sort out those problems from before... so we're going to try and make a go of it.\n\nI say go for it. Just have a think about living with more intention. What do you want? Your values, boundaries etc. What's holding you back from this?

If yes then go for it.  \n\nMy good friends when they found themselves in this situation made a pact with each other. They would date for 6 months to a day and no matter how sweet their life will be they would brake up with each other no contact for 3 months. They were so afraid of the brakeup that they wanted to get it over with. They did so and on the day of brake up they voiced all the things that annoyed them while they were together and said their goodbyes. 3 months later they started to hang out together and feel the sparks flying again. Brakeup was har on them. They decided they would be strictly platonic for the next 3 months to see if they still can. The were truly best buds in this time and they kept their words but when this last dateline ended they jumped on each other. After all this ordeal i asked them what were they because they confused our friend group.

            "So many years ago, my male best friend and I had some physical things happen and I do know what it\u2019s like to get that \u201codd\u201d feeling. But you know what? It quickly faded, I wasn\u2019t actually into it, it never really happened again. We\u2019re still close-ish though and while we live on opposite ends of the country now, we still make plans to get together at least once a year. So I\u2019m not actually worried for your friendship, if my friend and I could work it out (despite all the emotions and hard times that ensued), I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be okay. \n\nHowever.........I\u2019m not convinced you *aren\u2019t* into it! It sounds like both of you are open to a romantic future together. Otherwise, it probably wouldn\u2019t have kept happening and building up to a really passionate night. Obviously you care about her so much that you might even sacrifice those romantic feelings just to stay connected, I don\u2019t know, sounds like the type of selfless love good relationships are built on. \n\nBut that\u2019s what it sounds like to people reading your post. So I think you have to really sit down with yourself (not with her, actually, just think about it on your own first) and figure out what you\u2019re really feeling. Looks to many people here like a sort of \u201ctrue love,\u201d but perhaps we\u2019re all just hopeless romantics. So... is that what you\u2019re feeling though? Do you desire her romantically? Why do you care so much about this particular friendship, why is it so important to you? Did this encounter make you uncomfortable, was this all just some drunken mistake? Are there some practical reasons you\u2019re holding back or it might not work out? If you are feeling romantic love now, are you prepared to be rejected by her/do you have a plan to deal with that if it happens? \n\n**edit** Man I had this whole thing written out but I just saw in the comments that you admitted you do have feelings for her now. Oi! Well if you know that, you should really tell her and let her decide for herself the next move!",

It\u2019s clear that he\u2019s can let go, and is displaying abusive characteristics. You need to tell her to stand up to him, or you can help her if things get worse. If anything, she needs to let the family know about the way he\u2019s acting.\n\nY\u2019all are doing way to much unnecessary thinking right now.",
            "She says she doesn't want to ruin the friendship but then had sex with you. Keeps acting in contradicting ways. Seems to me she's leading you on.",
            "It's really hard to tell, coz six years in friendship with an opposite sex, no dating each other or no dating other people, I really admire your that special thing you got guys. Bt thing I see she could be running away from her feelings, maybe her ex, it ended pushing her buttons, and the other thing she be developing feelings for you, (bt don't take this too seriously for now coz I think) coz it could be she's trying to run away from it. Bt before going all that way, how do you feel abt her, then find out how she feels abt you, it's ok for best friend to fall in love bt again it's risky for your friendship too. You\u2019ve been good friend sit and talk abt, be careful it\u2019s sensitive situation for both of you, you end up both hurting each, be sincere to each, then take it from there.",
            "It sounds like she really likes you but is afraid you don't feel the same way about her and is concealing her feelings and trying to play it \"cool\" and not come off as overbearing. \n\nI played this game with a man I was head over heels for after two years spent becoming best friends. I was worried he didn't want to date and I didn't want to seem clingy...so we just hooked up repeatedly. It ended with me feeling heartbroken when (we said nothing of exclusivity) he hooked up with a girl I was friends with (she initiated). \n\nI cried a lot and told him I needed to talk. We ended up having a long talk where I told him my true feelings and how devastated I felt. He told me he didn't think I wanted a serious relationship and I was the most important person to him. He couldn't bear the loss of our relationship. \n\nWe've been together 5 years now and will be married next year.\n\nI would encourage an honest conversation about what you both want now. It sounds like you want each other, are very well suited, care very deeply about one another, and it is probably worth taking the chance."

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been with my fianc\u00e9 for 3 years and plan to get married next year. We love each other and are committed to building a life and home together.\n\nBut I crave intimacy and physical contact. I find myself crying to sleep most nights.\n\nWe used to have sex multiple times a week, but now we have sex once a week at most. And if we do have sex, I have to initiate it. I will always initiate foreplay and will almost always give him oral sex. It is rare that he returns the favor. Almost every time, the foreplay is abruptly ended when he tells me, \u201cjust get on top\u201d\u2014 so he can finish. Sex ends when he finishes. We only have sex when I\u2019m on top because it\u2019s the most pleasurable for him. Sex with him is not intimate. He lays on his back with his eyes closed. There is no touching outside of the penetration. I have to force his hands on my breasts. Sex is sterile and feels transactional. As soon as he\u2019s done, he goes to sleep. I have never orgasmed. On the most frustrated nights, I force his hands towards my vagina so I can finish as well. \n\nWhen we first started dating, he used to masturbate in bed while I would be next to him. He would masturbate before attempting to initiate sex with me. This erupted in a big fight and he no longer does this. Now I can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019ve just replaced his hand. \n\nA few weeks ago, we went camping and he couldn\u2019t sleep. He asked to have sex so he can orgasm and sleep. That was obviously not the most romantic way to go about initiating sex. I\u2019ve never felt so used in my life.\n\nAfter work every night when we are home, we will kiss each other sporadically throughout the night. His kisses are just little pecks on the lips when we\u2019re watching tv. I barely feel his lips. I have to pull him towards me to ask for a real passionate kiss. I ask to cuddle or hug or embrace but he says it\u2019s not comfortable for him to do so on the couch.\n\nEvery night, we\u2019ll be on the couch (not touching, with a body of space between us)  and then he will take a hit of marijuana and all of sudden will say he\u2019s going to bed. He\u2019ll crawl into bed as I get ready for bed. When I\u2019m ready to sleep and get into bed, he\u2019s already sleeping and I have to strain myself to reach over to kiss him on the lips goodnight.\n\nAs we are in bed, his back is towards me. It is hard for me to fall asleep without warmth or some physical touch. I find myself grasping at a pillow and putting a pillow on my back to mimic that physical human comfort. Again, I will cry myself to sleep or go on my phone until I\u2019m tired. At this point, he is fast asleep.\n\nHe wakes up before me and I feel that he is. Every day I feel a little hope that he will grab to cuddle me. But every day he will only cuddle when he knows I\u2019m half awake and will do so for about 5-10 minutes before jumping up to sit on the couch, go on his phone, watch espn and walk the dog. I hear these activities every morning as I lay in bed awake, with my pillows again near me for physical comfort.\n\nOn weekend nights, I get the most sexual energy from him, but that is after him getting high all day. Again the sex feels very one sided, but at least he will tell me  he wants sex. The night on a sex night will end with him rolled over and again without me feeling recognized.\n\nI have tried talking to him on several occasions but it usually ends up with him yelling at me saying it\u2019s all not true and \u201cwe do cuddle!!!\u201d With all the yelling and the lack of change, am I doomed for a marriage with zero intimacy?\n\nTL;DR - My love language is physical touch and I\u2019m not feeling loved.  \n\n\n\u2014-\n\nEdit: A commenter asked if he shows his love in other ways. Yes, he will buy me flowers and say I love you multiple times a day. Every morning when he gets to work he sends me a kissing emoji. He will wash the dishes and has made dinner. His love language is definitely acts of service. \n\nWe can have intimate, emotional, spiritual, and intellectual conversations. There are so many reasons why I love him and want to have a future with him. We respect each other as partners. We are good at communication and have managed to talk through our issues as they come up but on this particular topic of sex and physical contact is where it\u2019s been the most difficult.",

            "I have to say that one of the biggest red flags for me in any relationship is someone who doesn\u2019t care about the other person getting off during sex. If you don\u2019t care or make an effort to try to get the other person off during sex, you\u2019re using them as a masturbatory device. Women do it too but I feel like it\u2019s more common amongst men. & its telling. It\u2019s so extremely telling. Have you had any conversations about why he doesn\u2019t try to get you off? Why he doesn\u2019t care? Is he unsure or insecure of his ability to perform oral or use toys/vibrators/whatever else? Or does he just not think it\u2019s important?\n\nSex & physical intimacy is a big deal for most people & its something you need to really have figured out before you get married. Don\u2019t marry this guy until you\u2019ve been on the same page about sex & intimacy for many consistent months, if not a whole year, where he\u2019s put in effort to meet you halfway when it comes to intimacy. Because if you marry him now he\u2019s not going to just magically change because a piece of paper says he\u2019s your wife. Counseling is going to be your best bet for saving this relationship. Because right now he\u2019s using you as a state of the art self heating fleshlight with the HouseWife add on kit & its fucked up. You\u2019ve been together 3 years & he\u2019s never made you cum. Does he know this? That you don\u2019t orgasm from just penetrative sex? Cumming from solely penetrative sex doesn\u2019t really happen for a lot of women, & he\u2019s not making an effort to pleasure you in the ways you like/need. 3 years is way too fucking long for someone to make little to no effort towards making someone feel good during sex. \n\nTMI time for my personal experience with men who don\u2019t care about getting women off during sex:\n\nMy bf used to be insecure about eating pussy. He was a...very sexually active person before we met & yet had never really given oral to a girl (it was HS so idk if the girls just weren\u2019t comfortable asking for what they wanted or something but he never offered anyways). He was always told by girls he had sex with that he was like a fucking pornstar or something, & so shortly after we started dating I had to break it to him that I was really unimpressed by how little effort he put into making me cum. He wasn\u2019t all that great. It was one of the factors that made me not want to have sex with him. He didn\u2019t care about making me cum, he wanted me to do all this work to make him feel like a sex god & yet...I had to struggle to get him to touch my fucking vagina. So I told him, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re insecure about possibly not being good at head, I\u2019ll freaking record an audio book for you of what to do step by step if it means you\u2019ll try, & I don\u2019t care about getting off *every* time, I care that you *try*. & I said that I wasn\u2019t having sex with him until he made an effort to get me off because I\u2019m not a fleshlight for him to use whenever he wants. & he\u2019d bitch & moan about me not wanting to have sex w him every time he initiated & I looked him dead in the face & was like \u201cwhy would I be dying for sex w you when you don\u2019t give a damn about how sex is for ME?\u201d Like I\u2019m not going to this carnival if I\u2019m just gonna be the ride operator & you\u2019re the only one who gets to have fun on the rides. Screw that, this is my carnival too. \n\nthen he started caring & he makes an effort every time we have sex to get me off. & its more enjoyable for everyone now because he loves that he gets me off! & it makes him feel good to know that he\u2019s able to do it & it makes sex better for him because he *knows* I\u2019m into it. \n\nYou might be able to have that convo yourself before you shell out money for counseling, but if it doesn\u2019t go anywhere then definitely go to counseling. & don\u2019t marry this guy until y\u2019all have worked this sex & intimacy thing out. If you need more physical touch then he\u2019s providing, outside of sex, your love languages might be different. But you should be meeting each other halfway about stuff like that. Compatibility doesn\u2019t need to be 100% for it to work, it just needs 100% commitment to meet in the middle somewhere so everyone gets what they need.",

Don't expect sex to increase in frequency necessarily - he may just have a low sex drive, which is ok; compromise needs to go both ways. But he needs to understand you need some form of intimacy. \n\nBut put marriage on hold for now. If counseling works, make sure it's not just a quick temporary change to get you off his back. Ask yourself, the situation as it is now - do you want to live the rest of your life like that? Crying and hugging pillows?",

Every single thing you mentioned is like music to my ears because I could never explain it right and sometimes I thought I was going crazy or expecting too much. So thank you so much for making me feel better about my shitty situation. Here's how I came to my conclusion: my bf and i had very different love languages. I tried so hard to be ok with never having any of that physical affection or compassion but it made me miserable. I loved (and still do love) him very much but i decided i couldn't live the rest of my life without ever feeling that affection again.

That is fucking ridiculous and not a way for anyone to live life. Take charge of your fucking life girl. \n\nYou only have one life, is it worth spending it in misery and frustration? It will always be like this. He is who he is. The solution isn't to change someone, it's to recognize you arent fully compatible and you need to grow apart.

He's never been intimate or given you what you need, why the hell have you lived with it? \n\nHe will never change, that is who he is. You think that telling him how you feel will make him want things differently, it never will. You stayed and he probably doesnt think the problem you voice is an every day problem. \n\nAnd if he does recognize you are unhappy and makes no effort then that speaks volumes as is. That means he doesnt see you as a person, he sees you as a feature of his life. \n\nYou need to not marry him, because this relationship is proving it wont be a happy marriage. \n\nIt is fucked up that you think it's okay to cry yourself to sleep over lack of intimacy, no one should ever have to live like that. Why must you give up happiness for his happiness? Why are you the sacrificial lamb? Stop sacrificing yourself so it's easier for others to love you. \n\nA little love from the wrong person is NEVER worth the amount of love you can get from the right person.

Yelling is the opposite of good communication skills and only serves the person doing it, if that. It creates fear / anxiety in others. As for the person doing the yelling, it may make them feel better temporarily about something, or in the worst cases is just a means to make the other person shut up.\n\nInstead of a long conversation, try using your words in the moment.\n\n\"I need some extra physical contact with you today. Lets add pillows to the couch to make it more comfortable. I want at least an hour, preferably uninterrupted.\" (30 minutes, whatever works for you, just let him know than 10 minutes is insufficient for you.)\n\n\"I need a better/longer/deeper kiss than that. \"\n\nWith sex, \"I'm not ready to move on to that part yet.\" Ending before you: \"Now I need your help getting mine.\"\n\nI don't have an answer for oral, but I don't have any issues with refusing to do that at all when the scales are severely imbalanced. \n\nIf using words to express your needs in the moment doesn't at least result in compromise on his part, or more intimacy, then you guys are incompatible.\n\nGreat conversations without romantic intimacy is more like a friend than lover, especially when one person needs that to feel loved. \n\nYou should not feel lonely in a romantic relationship while the other person is in the room.\n\nThis relationship will not end well if you marry him without finding out if he is both capable and willing to meet this need. If it stays the same, your sense of loneliness will only grow and may turn into depression. You find yourself vulnerable to the temptation of cheating when/if the opportunity arose. Ultimately, the marriage would be unsatisfying, leading to either divorce or a lifetime spent trapped in an unsatisfactory relationship. \n\nDon't do that to yourself. Yes, give him the opportunity to show that he's open and willing to work on this with you, but don't stick around if he's not. It's not worth it.",
            "I think u both have different love languages. You should look more into this. Each of us interpret love differently and u may be someone who needs \"touch\" to feel love. He should communicate with u with ur love langauge and u should with him. Sounds like he is a \"words\" and \"objects\" guy as that's how he thinks u will feel love from him (so he expects that as well).",
            "If someone doesn\u2019t speak your love language or care to accommodate you\u2019re needs this will only be the beginning of a life wasted marriage. This will never go away unless you numb apart of yourself which then will still eventually destroy your marriage. Get out now.  Go find true love.\n\n\nYou will eventually gain resentment within this relationship and years and years of that with out a doubt will stain you into unhealthy mind, body & spirit  patterning. \n\nYour person is still out there.",
            "You sound so very lonely and miserable. While you may feel you have great conversations and he does stuff for you and buys you flowers, it's far from normal or ideal to regularly cry yourself to sleep at night. I'm sure he's far from the worst guy you could marry, but he's also obviously not nearly the best. Do you really want to cry yourself to sleep for the next 50 years?",
            "Just popped in to say his love language being acts of service is clearly not showing up in any form of intimacy and that should be a huge red flag. Idk if he needs therapy for his issues or if you're just compatible at that level, but either way please do not marry him when you're already feeling so alone and used, it will not just magically get better if you're married.",
            "This really sounds like a nightmare. I had a similar situation with my ex, where we would spend lots of time together but would barely touch each other unless we had sex, which was rare and I almost always had to initiate (he's bipolar and has low sex drive a lot of the time). When we did have sex it was always intimate and passionate, and my ex cared about my pleasure. I would never stick around for someone who didn't even do the minimum in making it pleasurable for me. \n\nI know how scary it must be to imagine leaving him and having to start over, but this sounds like absolute misery. Unless he has some deep-seated reason why he is averse to being intimate and he is willing to work on it, I think you should go. No matter how well you get along in other areas, you will *always* have this need unfulfilled.",
            ">I find myself crying to sleep most nights.\n\nWhy would you marry this person? They are not considerate towards you. They sound selfish and I am guessing sex isn't the only time this trait shows up. \n\n>We can have intimate, emotional, spiritual, and intellectual conversations.\n\nNext time you have an intimate emotional conversation you need to communicate about sex and how you cry every night.",
            "Please, don\u2019t marry a person who leaves you feeling like this. I was in a relationship like this where I was absolutely starved for intimacy and physical affection. I too would cry myself to sleep some nights. It was miserable and no amount of talking to him about the problem, begging for some kind of touch to make me feel wanted changed anything.\n\nI\u2019m in a relationship with someone who makes me feel loved in every way. The frequency of sec has dropped off considerably since we started dating two years ago, but he still makes me feel loved and desired everyday. I\u2019ve never felt the loneliness that I felt in my last relationship. I had my first orgasm with a partner with him and I\u2019ve had many more since. \n\nPlease, don\u2019t settle for how your fianc\u00e9 is treating you. Sex and intimacy are important. Your needs and your desires are important. You matter. This problem will not resolve itself if you get married.",
            "This seems like an issue beyond normal fading interest in a long term relationship. It seems like it almost pains him to have to be intimate with you. I'm really sorry, I know this post isn't about him, but I'm wondering if maybe he's not attracted to you anymore, or something happened...? Or his sexual orientation isn't actually what you think it is...? \n\nIdk if this will help with some perspective but in my marriage, I'm the Acts of Service partner, and my husband is the Physical Touch partner. Currently, I am exploring what my issues with not wanting sexual intimacy are. And I can tell you that they are doozies. For me, it's stemming from a lot of guilt and really bad programming I've received from my first relationships...blah blah blah. Also I have some physical issues that I'm literally starting physical therapy for today. \n\nI guess my point is, there COULD be underlying issues. If there are, he should want to find them and fix them. If he doesn't want to do that, then you need to not marry this guy because you don't want to be in a relationship for the rest of your life where you feel like this. It's not worth it, no matter how many Acts of Service he gives you.",
            "Good grief. Either he is a) Not attracted to you b) Gay or c) A selfish asshole. \n\nIt won\u2019t get better after you marry. (In fact it usually gets worse). You don\u2019t want to be in this situation one day from now, let alone 5 years from now. Better to get out before you get married and have to get divorced instead.",
            "I can see both sides here. I get the need for intestacy and closeness but sex isn't the be all end all thing in a relationship. Outside of that you guys seem to have a great relationship and he shows he cares in many other ways as you said. Sex is just a small part. It's hard to find someone who compliments us in every other aspect. You can find anyone to have sex with but to find someone sweet, loyal, cleans up after themselves, an so on is very difficult. Sex will be a thing that fades anyway, there's so many other important things to focus on in a relationship. \n\nI do completely understand as well closeness is important to some more than others, but it's a thing you either have to accept about your partner or you don't. Is that stuff you crave right now that won't be there in 20 yrs more important than having a loving, loyal partner? Are you willing to risk ending it to find someone else who is wanting sex more but cares less, says \"I love you\" once a week or something else you would have problems with? \n\nNo one is going to be perfect. I was in a similar situation as yourself but I realized my bf and how he is towards me is more valuable than how often we have sex. No one will tell me they love me the way he does, no one will call me \"love\" the way he does, or be the little spoon when we go to sleep and many more little things. I trust him 100% and that to me is more valuable than amount of intimacy.\n\nJust some things to think about :) Just consider what is more important to you, talk to him about it and maybe find a solution that way. If his drive is just low for whatever reason it's not his fault, happens to a lot of people, it's just who they are at that time. It could be just a temp. stress kinda thing or perm. but that's something you will have to consider as well, and again if you don't think you can accept then it would be best to move on.",

            "I had a relationship like this for over a decade. We were great friends! I'm so glad it is over now... I think in retrospect you will find that this is not working for you. You can't change him. Can you live the rest of your life fulfilled with this man?",

Please do try counseling with him if you want to try and work through this together, but... Definitely visit r/deadbedrooms, as others have suggested. Your pain is real, and chances are incredibly high that your pain is not going to go away, because you are who you are, and he is who he is, and the two of you want different things when it comes to intimacy.\n\nDM me if you'd like, u/catville13337, if you'd like a listening ear from someone who understands what you're going through.",
            "I was in this situation once. \n\nUntil I met someone that made me feel cherished and adored, and satisfies me in the three most crucial ways: sexually, emotionally, intellectually. \n\nIt was incredibly difficult to leave a partner over something that, at the time, felt like something I should just \u201cdeal with\u201d. I thought it was a me problem. Thought I was too needy. looking back, I should have left the relationship the first time I felt uncherished or unloved. Would have saved me from a lot of emotional turmoil which definitely leaked into other aspects of my life. \n\nIt sounds like he\u2019s satisfying you intellectually but not sexually or emotionally. It\u2019s okay to have these standards and to do whatever needs to be done to have them met. \n\nThe only person who\u2019s going to advocate for you is you.",
            "I couldn\u2019t even read this entire post. This is the  worst/saddest situation. Been where you have been. Begging for sex. Crying at night due to the other person not making you feel wanted. Dreading bed time. Going to bed early so you don\u2019t have to deal the fact that they won\u2019t initiate it or being rejected when you do. It\u2019s the worst feeling. You guys are not compatible when it comes to sex. It gets worse not better. Please know that it\u2019s not your fault. There is nothing wrong with you. You guys are just not compatible. Or in my case the other person was not happy with themselves or their body. After years of complaining about not feeling wanted I finally just ended things. my ex (I\u2019m female, they were male) confessed some of their insecurities with their body that affected our sex life after the breakup. Little too late at that point. Feeling like your begging for sex sucks. When you find someone where you don\u2019t have to beg them to make you feel wanted, it will be the most amazing feeling!",

            "First off, tell him you want to improve your sex life. Be honest and tell him you've never orgasmed. Talk about things you'd like to see in bed.\n\nSecond, find solid goals with solid actions to improve the 'cuddliness' you want in your relationship. Get in the habit of holding hands on walks or something. Ask him for a 'real' kiss before he leaves for work everyday. It's a two person effort-- you have to believe him when he says he's trying, and obviously he needs to put in a real effort. It's not one bit 'romantic', but the point is for it to become second nature to him.\n\nAnd above all, DO NOT MARRY HIM RIGHT NOW. Call off the wedding. Yes, this is a form of escalation but you need to deal with this now rather than later. Do not marry someone who leaves you 'crying' every night. And couple's therapy is a huge given here.",

            "He needs to know you're serious about this!!!  Tell him that he needs to work with you or it's over.   Simple as that!  Also, have him get his testosterone checked.   My wife and I were in a similar situation, though not as bad.   Once she put it out there that she needed sex or a divorce it opened my eyes.   I had my T levels checked and they were absurdly low.   I got put on testosterone injections and ever since im as horny as my 14 year old self was.   I can't get enough of her now!!!  Lol!  Low T can also cause emotional issues as well.   Have him get it checked out, it's worth a try.   It saved my marriage!  If he's unwilling to try to work with you and get this resolved though, remember there are plenty of other horny ass fish out there that'd be glad to take care of ya!",

            "My husband is a lot like this, for us it has taken a lot of conversation to get him to understand the depths of how this affects me, and he is working on it, but this isn't something that is going to change over night. It will take time and a lot of discussion.   \n\n\nIt has helped my husband for me to dictate some things I'd like him to try and then I give positive feedback on. You also have ot be willing to recognize his love languages (not that you don't).  \n\n\nBy far my husband is an amazingly loving man, it's just about learning love languages, and it's okay to say \"hey I really need this right now\" express your needs especially when you are feeling the way you do, it doesn't always permanently fix it, but it at least has helped my hubs and me.",
            "You need to figure out right now how important sex and physical contact is for you. I too use to cry myself to sleep because my husband wouldn't touch me. It led to a ridiculous amount of insecurity on my part and feeling like I wasn't good enough. This never changed once throughout the course of our marriage and I am only now starting to gain my self esteem back now that I have left. Sex was very important to me. Extenuating circumstances aside, I like sex on a semi regular basis. I like physical contact and kissing. I like feeling needed. He not only didn't feel this way but also never did it because he knew I wanted it. This issue was the primary cause for my divorce.\n\nYou need to figure out what is important to you and what you can handle. Crying yourself to sleep at night isn't normal or part of a healthy relationship.",
            "Sexual frequency does NOT improve with marriage.\nSo many people think issues will be diminished or disappear altogether after they say 'I do' but the opposite is pretty much always true. \nSee if things can be fixed BEFORE marriage. Breaking up is a lot less stressful and far cheaper and quicker than a divorce.\nAsk him if he's satisfied being with someone he's making so lonely she cries everyday.",

            "You deserve better. I\u2019ll tell you that first. Second, you shouldn\u2019t be with anyone who makes you question anything like that, sexually. I would tell him that he needs to get his testosterone levels checked because he\u2019s acting like a little girl and you shouldn\u2019t have to practically beg for him to notice that you deserve more. The fact that he used to masturbate with you next to him without trying to have sex with you first gives me the creeps. You deserve wayyyyy  better than that. If he\u2019s a jerk or can be one and you want him to see how it feels to feel unwanted or question yourself, I would just casually hit his ego and say- \u201cI can\u2019t be with a man who is that lazy in bed. For god sakes- it gets old to be on top all the time, is that the only move you can think of, cause I can think of a lot more and it would be nice if you actually got ME off for once\u201d. Maybe be really honest and tell him something like- \u201csome women may not have the sexual appetite like I do, but most men I know would be thankful for a quality in a woman like that and not turn into a male dead fish that\u2019s laying there for pleasure\u201d. . I\u2019m not trying to start a war and it\u2019s totally up to you how you handle it. However, he\u2019s making you question yourself and kinda wasting your time if he isn\u2019t gonna get with it. Sounds like he\u2019s made you question yourself quite a bit and your relationship. I\u2019m just saying, unless it\u2019s a deal breaker (you might want to ask yourself if you want this relationship forever). He isn\u2019t questioning himself apparently, but doesn\u2019t seem to care about your feelings when it comes to this matter. I would really let him know how much of a woman you are so he realizes you will walk if he doesn\u2019t get his side together soon.",

He doesn't know it, and will be hard for him to admit it. I can relate directly to him. It doesn't mean he doesn't love you or does not find you attractive.

Best advice I\u2019ve ever held on to is when someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time. \nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. There is so much better out there and you deserve it.",
            "You are three years into a relationship that makes you weep with loneliness. Is this the future you want? He is not fulfilling your needs, isn't even creating a mutually beneficial sexual situation and you want to continue? If you have spoken your needs, and he refuses to meet them, perhaps the two of you would be better friends than lovers.\n\nTry thinking of it not as bf/gf. Think of it as two people choosing to be together and fulfill each other's wants and needs to the best of their ability. Or not. Perhaps he does see his love language as service, but you are asking for your sexual and intimacy needs to be fulfilled. He is not doing this. He can have sex, but he isn't doing this as much as you want. He can perform acts to you, but chooses not to. Whatever reason he is allowing this gap - are you willing to be with someone who is unwilling to step up to your needs? Ok, so maybe he's tired, and instead of three times a day, he's into it once a week. That's a difference in volume. Based on the data, even when there is intimacy it is 100% on his terms and meeting his desires. So he isn't meeting your needs sexually. He also is not providing physical comfort in other ways. He is failing to try to meet your needs. \n\nFor me I see this as a root incompatability. Sometimes we are just built where our needs do not match. Sometimes, that can be overcome. Sometimes you look to the future and realize that the two of your could be happier and better served with different sex partners.",
            "Why did you get mad at him for jacking off in bed i think that's what turned him sexually or something idk.",
            "I am a female, but very much like your fiance. I experienced some long term, pretty serious abuse as an adolescent.  It's been 25 years and I still have issues with certain types of physical touch and intimacy is completely lost on me.  I certainly can't say if your fiance has had any traumatic experiences, but it's all too familiar to me not to bring up the similarity.\n\n I am not comfortable with too much physical touch.  I do not like cuddling.  It feels hot and claustrophobic to me.  I sleep on my own side; minimal, if any, touching.  I don't mind having sex.  Sometimes I actually really want to and will initiate.  But a lot of the time, I will accommodate my husband and either talk myself into wanting it or just do him a solid because we take care of the people we love.  (FWIW, the act itself is not upsetting or traumatic for me.)  I have made a point to get to sleep before he comes to bed before because I just know what's coming and know I can't deal today.  I guess it's just easier than rejection.   I make other efforts to accommodate his needs for physical touch (which are more than mine, but fortunately not excessive) but I will never be that snuggly, touchy, handsy person.  I don't mind the pecks and the little hugs through the day.  I do like when he puts his hand on my back or touches my neck or head.  That is a nice show of affection without being too intimate or smothering.  I love my husband very much and I find him quite attractive.  But it hurts me that he's stuck married to someone who has \"issues\" and so many reservations.  I have a lot of regret for not telling him about my past before we married.  I often feel guilty that he didn't get the chance to decide if he could handle the residual effects.  \n\nYour fiance is being quite selfish and disrespectful when it comes to sex.  At 33, he should know better.  You should not be crying yourself to sleep at night.  Even if he has certain reservations, he can give a little extra out of love & respect for you.  He may never become the touchy, feely guy that you want & need.  Regardless of the reasons, he's spent 33 years being this way and no matter how much he loves you, it may never come naturally to him. \n\nIt's possible you can come to an acceptable middle ground compromise on the physical contact.  He may have to make a deliberate effort and you may still not get as much as you'd like, but you're closer.  I suggest you do some soul searching to decide if you can live with that forever.  Meanwhile, you need to go hard at sorting out the selfish sex.  This HAS to be handled before you get married.  If you can't fix it before you're married, you certainly won't fix it after.   \n\nIn my opinion, this is something that could be worked out with the right open communication, understanding, compromise & practice.  But you have some work to do before you are ready to tie the knot.",
            "Sounds like you both need to see a sex therapist, or do some tantric practices together.\n\nIf you're going to be married, you have to be able to talk about everything. Let him know you are unsatisfied with your sex life, and that you want to improve it. It might be the pot, honestly, as it can kill your libido a bit. He might also have erectile difficulties, and so he could be embarrassed by this. It might be very difficult for him to talk about it because he feels ashamed and less manly as a result.\n\nSo, initiate the conversation, be firm about focusing on solutions regarding YOUR feelings, rather than assigning blame. No blame. No blame at all. Don't even let him blame himself. You want to be sexually satisfied, so you need to ask for what you want. And you need to push for it, the same way he does.\n\nAlso, operate on a carrot and stick model. Reward and encourage intimacy, and ignore lack of intimacy. If he's being unromantic, just say, \"I might be in the mood if you are willing to put in more effort than that. You willing to be intimate, or would you rather go jerk off in the bathroom?\"",

            "I was thinking of writing a similar post.  Except I married my guy and had three kids with him.  \n\nWe have sex once a month.  It\u2019s almost always initiated by me.  There is maybe 90 seconds of foreplay.  \n\nHe kisses me a quick peck before going to work.  We have never \u201ccuddled\u201d.  The only time we touch is if he asks me to scratch his back, or if I initiate a hug.  \n\nIt isn\u2019t always like this, but most of the time.  He isn\u2019t really affectionate with the kids, either.  I don\u2019t know what his love language is- he doesn\u2019t buy me gifts (unless it\u2019s my birthday/Christmas).  Sometimes he gets up before me on the weekend and there will be a cup of coffee waiting for me on the table.  Does that count?  I spend 6 nights out of 7 completely alone- as soon as the kids are asleep he is either down in his office or asleep himself.  I sit by myself and watch TV.  I go to bed by myself.  He comes to bed hours later than me.  \n\nI tell him I love him, I rub his back, I compliment him on his appearance, or his hard work, I show concern.  He does none of these things other than occasionally giving me a side hug and saying \u201cyou know I love you\u201d if I complain.  \n\nI know that when he is stressed at work it\u2019s worse.  It is impossible for him to separate work from home life, and he always puts work first.  He cares more about being perfect in his career than he cares about being a perfect spouse/husband.  This is something that I am coming to terms with, and sometimes I feel horribly trapped.  I will be going back to work in the next year or two and it will be interesting how the dynamics change.  \n\nI don\u2019t need a lot of physical affection, but I would like some once in a while.  \n\nBasically my advice is to make a life for yourself outside of your relationship, or else leave before you complicate things by a marriage and kids.",

            "Don't marry this person, at least not until this behavior has changed, and the change has lasted at least six months to a year. He may have issues that can be resolved in therapy, but he's being incredibly selfish. \n\nThis is very similar to my sex life and intimacy with my husband. We have been married 14 years, and we are about to get divorced. It isn't the only issue, but it is a big one. I became so traumatized by being just used and rarely wanted, that I got to a point where I didn't feel emotionally safe having sex with him at all. Honestly I would suggest that you stop having sex with him immediately, because based on your description, you are being emotionally wounded every time it happens. Explain why, of course. It may get his attention and lead to change, or it may not, but you need to take care of yourself. Also consider sleeping separately. I know that feeling of loneliness. My husband used to always get angry with me for waking him up if I wanted a cuddle. Sleeping alone is better.",
            "I am also someone who needs a lot of physical contact to feel happy/safe/loved in a relationship. My partner is not naturally this way, and was not used to it from previous relationships, but he makes a consistant effort everyday to make sure that he touches me with affection both sexually and non-sexually. He checks in to make sure he is showing me love in a way that I can recognize and feel. Likewise, I make an effort every day to speak to him in his love language, and check in to make sure that his needs are being met as well.\n\nYou seem aware that your partner's love language is acts of service. It's awesome that you recognize this - do you engage in acts of service toward him to show him your love in a way that resonates with him? Knowing how you each show love is an important step. But it follows that you should each try to reciprocate in a way that your partner will feel and appreciate.\n\nUnfortunately, he is aware that you crave physical touch (you've told him and showed him!), but he is uncomfortable or unwilling to speak to you in your love language. A relationship has to be two-sided. If he won't even try to satisfy your needs, I highly doubt that this will work out for you guys. I was in a relationship with someone I loved who sadly was flat out unwilling to put in effort to make things work. At the time, I was devastated that the relationship was ending. But I have since found a partner who wants an equal partnership, who does not just prioritize his own happiness, and it has been amazing to me to see and feel what a healthy two-sided relationship is like. We still have rough spots and issues to work through, but we listen to each other, take requests and constructive criticism, and *both* work to be better partners.\n\nIf I was in a relationship like yours, I know I would be miserable. I would feel unloved and used and ignored. If I were you, and he was unwilling to put in real effort to change, I would have to leave the relationship, painful though that may be. Unfortunately, some people are not suited to each other. \nYou deserve to be with someone that cares if your needs are being met, and that makes you feel happy and safe and satisfied and loved.\n\nI'm sure you're flooded with responses at this point, but your post resonated with me and I wanted to reach out.

            "You're crying yourself to sleep and that's a big red flag. His sex drive is only going to diminish as he gets older, it won't get any better.

It will require a fundamental emotional growth from your Fiance and that growth usually only comes from people not being around to enable their selfish behaviour.

Snapchat. Friend from work. Strippers. \n\nThings just don\u2019t immediately change with a reason and you were smart to pick up on the changes.

            "I'd tell him that you understand that yes, you do cuddle, but not nearly as much or as long as you need. It is not a want. It is a need. Does he know you cry yourself to sleep? If not, you need to tell him that. Don't say it like you're accusing him of making you cry, just be open about how lonely you feel in this relationship. You also need to be open about your expectations in the bedroom. He needs to make an effort or it won't happen at all. If these requirements cannot be met, you are not as compatible a couple as you need to be. Sure, you love him, he loves you, he treats you well, but there is so much more to life than that. He needs to stop being so selfish and defensive about his bedroom time with you. \n\n2 other very important things that may be affecting this- did he ever get addicted to masturbating/does he still do it and has he had his testosterone levels checked by the doctor? Low T often results in low bedroom activities and low energy/depression. He should have this checked. It is not an insult to him, it is possibly just a body part that doesn't work quite right but could work properly with medication and a doctor's help. If he is addicted to masturbating, he may have a difficult time keeping it going in the bedroom with you. Just Google that kind of addiction, evidently it can lead to similar issues. Hopefully you can fix this together. If he's not willing, then it sounds like you deserve to start over with someone new. Your sexual appetite will only increase from here, or so I've been told.",

            "Yeah, the yelling and just a refusal to acknowledge that you feel the way you do is not a good sign at all. He's just refusing to listen and emotionally punishing you for feeling the way you do by yelling. I think that shows that he knows that this is a problem, but would rather not deal with it than confront whatever is bothering. If that weren't happening, the yelling and getting defensive, then you could have a meaningful discussion on how to bridge the love language gap that would hopefully work for the both of you, but it's hard to do that with someone who refuses to even consider how you feel. Like, you say he does speak other love languages to you, and that's good and I can see why this is a difficult situation for you, but another question would be: How much effort has he put into doing loving things, not things that he just wants to do, but things that you've told him you want (or vice versa, stopping things you don't want)? Like, if it's just the sex thing, then maybe through couple's counseling, by hearing it from a third party that you aren't happy with that aspect of your relationship and having a set of easily doable things that he could work on, where he can't just yell to shut down the discussion, maybe there's hope. If he just doesn't put in the effort for things that you want, and only does things he wants (even if they do show that he loves you), then you've got a bigger problem.\n\nOne general note: Sex with a long term partner isn't always going to be great, passionate lovemaking. People change and go through ups and downs and sometimes sex is more of a release or maybe there's isn't always alignment. That said, it shouldn't always be like that, there should also be times when it's \"Holy shit!\" level of passionate sex.",

I would even go so far as to suggest watching TV in bed to make it more comfortable for him, but then the excuse was he didn\u2019t like watching off a laptop in the bedroom. in bed there was absolutely no cuddling, \u201cit made him too hot.\u201d and if I was breathing too loud he would legitimately ask me to turn over. I would try to subtly, then outright, remind him that physical touch was my love language. and he was not receiving the message. we shared a bed, and I had to silently cry myself to sleep so he wouldn\u2019t ask what was wrong. we\u2019d have sex, and by the time I got out of the bathroom after he\u2019d be back at drawing or video games. it\u2019s so hard to end something you\u2019ve been committed to and put your entire heart and soul into for so long, but you need to put yourself and your needs first now, before it goes on longer. the longer you\u2019re in it, they harder the ending will be. if you\u2019re already crying yourself to sleep because of the relationship, marriage won\u2019t fix it. you may still love him, which makes ending it even harder, that doesn\u2019t make it any less important that you do this for yourself. be strong, you are supported.",

You can try to talk to him but I think it's rather a deep incompatibility. I'm not necessarily  advising to break up, but make sure you are in touch with your feelings. If you are miserable and crying yourself to sleep, you need to do something to change this situation and talk about your feelings openly with your fianc\u00e9.",
            "That\u2019s great that you respect each other but why on earth would you want a life of no intimacy? If you can\u2019t stand it now, fast forward to your future self in 30 years. \nSeek counseling now, set a deadline of let\u2019s say a year and if nothing changes DO NOT GET MARRIED!!!",
            "I\u2019ve had this problem before. Turns out my ex was gay.",
            "Sounds like you need to have a very serious conversation with him. You have already written down how you feel here so you're already through the first step. Now, figure out what specifically you want. Find a time you know you can have a serious conversation, let him know before hand to set aside the time, and have a good talk. Get out everything you want to say. Then set a clear goal. Ask him if he will do that. You can even talk about what you can do for him in exchange. But find something you can agree to and then plan another time to talk in a week where you can discuss how it is going. \n\nPersonally, I have a little marriage meeting each Sunday night with my wife to talk about what we want to work on such as better chore delegation, doing more recreational stuff together, planning future events or having better conversations. Sometimes its two minutes, sometimes its two hours, but the important thing is we are talking about the things couples sometimes ignore to the point that they become problems. Definitely make sure to stay ahead of your problems.\n\nBest of luck!",
            "If just talking doesn't work, tell him how much this bothers you. Maybe even let him read this. Tell him you don't wanna marry a guy that doesn't care about you, your feeling or sexual needs. Cause yes, sexual needs are also a big part of a healthy relationship. This doesn't sound healthy to be honest. Really sit him down and make sure he knows how serious you are. Good luck.",
            "I think he's just not physically attracted to you.",
            "Honestly.... I do not think your relationship should go past being engaged until you guys can talk about this and \"fix\" it. It's not fair to you, and will most likely end in divorce anyways. Not to be pessimistic, but the odds are against you.\nFrankly. I was disgusted to read this, finding out that a man who plans on marrying this woman, has the guys to treat her like this you deserve to be touched. To feel loved. Feel the passion. \nI do not know your guy's origin story, but it this sounds more like 2 people not wanting to be alone than 2 people who love each other and want to spend forever together.... I would be doing some serious thinking before that wedding day shows up....",
            "I can understand frustration between transactional sex, peck kisses that aren\u2019t passionate, and just lack of affection. This stuff can grate on you over time. \n\nSome people are just not like that. What you\u2019re explaining sounds exactly how I\u2019ve felt in my own marriage. Mismatch on sex can be really hard especially, when it\u2019s the primary thing you have issues on, and when you love someone with everything you got. \n\nIt seems like such a silly thing to be the one issue you have. But it hurts.",
            "Broke off my last relationship because of this.  It is like being in love with someone who looks at you like a sibling, it\u2019s horrible.",
            "Just before I got to your TLDR, I was gonna say something about you both reading the Love Languages book.  If he is a reader and hasn't done so yet, he should definitely pick up that book as it could be a huge help in guiding him to the light.  Clearly physical touch isn't as important to him as it is to you but if he wants the relationship to work, he's gonna have to make more of an effort to show you affection in ways that make sense for you. \n\nIn the same respect, it's entirely possible that the same is true for him and his primary love languages.  His level of showing affection via physical touch may have subsided as the honeymoon phase ended.  Relationships require effort from both parties in order to work.  It's been some time since I've read the love languages book myself but I recall there being an example in there that may work for your situation.  I don't remember exactly what it was but perhaps you should give it a read or reread yourself.",
            "I am experiencing the same problem. I wish you and your partner the best.",
            "ugh...your fiance feels like looking at myself in the mirror with one of my ex's back in my late 20s. It started off great but the physical intimacy died between us in the late stages of our relationship since I barely initiate sex and intimacy. She tried her hardest and made it happened but I wasn't feeling 80% of the time anymore while I was sorting through my own personal struggles (which I barely told her) and burying myself at work. I still tried being a good bf in other ways like your fiance but it just wasn't working anymore once the physical intimacy died and everything else slowly died until we stopped talking to each other and did our own things til she finally broke up with me. \n\nYour situation is different considering you're both engaged and have 3 years of history together and in your 30s so you're not getting any younger. If you truly wanna stay together for the long run, you should have a serious discussion together but getting a guy to truly open up about this topic is going to be extremely difficult. As a guy, I know and this is topic makes a guy feel really vulnerable and most guys hate feeling weak. He probably also doesn't fully understand that you still want this much intimacy after all these years. But you say he can have intimate, emotional, spiritual, and intellectual conversations so maybe he will open soon enough if you give it time and slowly build up this discussion. Start with light topics so he gets comfortable and over time, hopefully he'll open up and understand your perspective.",
            "Why don't you share this thread with him so he can read what your feeling and all these comments? Maybe he'll realize how big of a deal it really is to you and start making attempts towards fixing things. Good luck.",
            "He is gay and u should not have marry him, cause u have another temperament.",
            "If he is making you feel lonely, you should follow your heart. Do you want to stay or leave? You deserve to be with someone who makes you feel loved and appreciated",
            "I mean reading this it feels fairly obvious to me he's simply not attracted to you physically. You can love someone to death as a person and connect with them mentally, but you cannot force physical attraction.",
            "So many RED FLAGS here. \n\nFirst of all, daily pot smoking leads to having zero motivation to accomplish anything. \n\nSecond, you\u2019re not having sex. Anything that is a problem dating will be amplified in marriage. That includes both of your behavior and lack of actions.\n\nThird, he is selfish. If he doesn\u2019t care that your physical or emotional needs are met, what\u2019s the point?",
            "You aren't a partner. You are his sex doll. \n\nHim yelling at you when you try to bring up this issue is a huge dealbreaker. He has no basic respect for you.",
            "Please don\u2019t marry him and resign yourself to a life of this. It is lonely as hell. As painful as it is now it will only become more painful than you can imagine as it goes on.",
            "Great advice so far from the other comments.\nI just want to second that you really, REALLY need to think about whether you want to live the rest of your life like this.\n\nMarrying someone when you are crying yourself to sleep due to intimacy deprivation is probably going to turn out exactly how you expect. More of the same. \nI would say, try and put it in perspective for him that this is making you doubt your relationship/engagement, but do not put it as an ultimatum. You do not want him to try for x amount of time (until the wedding) and then go back to being selfish. He needs to hear you, understand you and put himself in your shoes, then really try.",
            "Any problems you have before getting married become 10X worse after the wedding",
            " Ok, has he been abused? Sounds like a good man with serious problems to express it physically. I can say from experience that an abuse could leave those marks",
            "If he doesn\u2019t even want to touch your boobs for his own pleasure he\u2019s not attracted to you. Maybe not attracted to women at all. If you occasionally had great sex this could be reparable, but I really think there are fundamental incompatibilities here.",
            "I was in a relationship like this, and once I decided to end it/he no longer felt like treating me well otherwise would reward him in anyway (i.e. the security of having a doormat of a partner) it became really clear that the selfishness he\u2018d shown me in the bedroom had been an underlying trait in the rest of our relationship too. He had only really respected me as far as he could use me sexually, materially, emotionally etc. He badgered me for casual sex during the breakup period \u201csince we weren\u2019t going to get with anyone else anytime soon\u201d and when I asked him why he was suddenly so interested in physical intimacy after years of ignoring my needs, he said (word for word - and not as an apology) \u201cI guess I knew that I could get sex at any time when we were together \u201d. Needless to say, I never spoke to him again. \n\nA partner who has no interest in trying to satisfy you in the ways you need to be satisfied in is not a partner who is compatible with you, or who cares for you. You deserve to have fulfilling physical intimacy if that is what you want. You deserve more than to stay this miserable for the rest of your life, and he needs to be the one who is putting effort into changing that within the relationship now. This isn\u2019t a matter of having differing sex drives of even different love languages, it\u2019s about consideration and respect. I\u2019m so sorry that you have to go through this, but I wish you well.",
            "I was in a comparable relationship, where there was no intimacy. In cases like this, I feel that is a big red flag for future frustration and dissatisfaction in the relationship. I'm sorry to say, and I hope I don't seem judgmental, but I fear that the best thing might be to reconsider the engagement. Perhaps making your point across , and if he is not receptive, I'm sorry, but it might not be for the best, especially if you need physical contact to feel love.",
            "Selfishness during sex is something concrete you ought to be able to discuss with him",
            "The biggest red flag here is that he has SEX with you. It\u2019s not making love. I know exactly what you mean. I\u2019ve been living with it for 13 years and I\u2019ve had enough. I focused too much on the good parts, not realizing that how he made me feel was the most important.",
            "You should seek couples counseling together. You guys are obviously mismatched and both of you need to learn how to approach it together. I feel the comments here are supremely one-sided, I\u2019ll probably get death threats over this, but this situation can be just as frustrating to him as well. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy to think about this in terms of who to blame, and right now the communication breakdown is not helping. Find professional help.",
            "Love language is a serious and real thing, dude. If someone isn\u2019t willing to at least put some effort into speaking your love language, I\u2019m a firm believer in that the relationship won\u2019t work out. \n\nSomeone can love you as loud as humanly possible. But if it\u2019s not in your love language, you won\u2019t hear a sound.",
            "\u201cWith all the yelling and the lack of change, am I doomed for a marriage with zero intimacy?\u201d\n\n\nYou seem very good at communication! You clearly understand yourself well if you\u2019re talking about your love language and why this isn\u2019t working for you) \nIf the other commenters\u2019 advice on how to communicate these issues with this doesn\u2019t work, you need to seriously reconsider if you want to go through with the marriage. \n\nYou are not stuck in this decision. Regardless of any pressure there may be to marry your fianc\u00e9, you will find love and support for your choice from somewhere. The worst pressure, though, can come from yourself. It can be so so hard to even consider the idea of breaking up with someone you love so deeply.\n\nWishing you the best.",
            "Married 6 years with 2 kids here.\n\n My love language is physical touch and I\u2019m not feeling loved. This sentence belongs to me! Just kindding but we are same with you. \n\nMy wife doesnt like to have sex or kiss randomly most of the times. \n\nSo if you have the possibiliy to leave, leave.\n\nBecause I really want to have more sex, 4 times a week and sometimes oral etc.\n\nBut I have to be the one who should initiate the sex sometime after it becomes exhausting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nto my opinion: please dont marry with him, you wont be happy, you will put yourself in much more depression.",
            "Wanted to pop in and advocate for back to back cuddling! I had never tried it before but my fiance got me into it. It feels so nice to have his warm back against mine, but doesn't crowd our ability to sleep.",
            "My need for touch put the nail in the coffin of a 3 year relationship. I loved him. But I was too needy. And he didnt want to get married. \n\nNow happily engaged to someone who knows I'm needy, can actually get me off, and I get to cuddle a lot more. \n\nYou deserve someone who can meet your needs",
            "Talk to him.\n\n\nAs for advice...it sounds like he is cheating on you and having sex with someone else. \nYeah I could be wrong but I am going based off of my experience. Not all men are sexually active  however most are and to go from always having sex to never wanting to have sex is one of two things either he is really tired from work OR he is doing it with someone else. \n\n\nSnoop around his phone.\nI hate that people expect people to JUST TRUST each other and shame people for snooping when engaged or married yet DON'T shame anyone for cheating. Screw that do your research first and then talk to him about how you want more sex and intimacy and pay attention to his reaction.",
            "He\u2019s selfish. Don\u2019t marry this guy. Doesn\u2019t care about you.",
            "I'm wondering if he's just not that physically attracted to women. \n\nAnd your feelings that your marriage will only get worse...oh boy, that's an understatement.",
            "I can't believe no one has said this in this thread yet, but are you sure he's attracted to women? I don't mean any offense. I just mean there's a very good chance he isn't attracted to women, which would explain why he's not very physical with you. People who are into women generally like seeing them enjoy themselves during sex, not have to close their eyes and pretend it's something else. As a gay man, this checks in with how I felt when I was sleeping with women because I hadn't discovered/explored who I am yet. There's a very good chance he's gay. \n\nFor your benefit and his, it's probably best not to get married. A certificate and celebration won't solve intimacy issues. They'll just be harder to escape.",
            "Why does no here having a problem with him taking drugs every day/every week? Where I come from marihuana is illegal. Also it makes people dumb and lazy and you also experience that he lost a big part of his libido.\nYou say you have great conversations, but talking will not keep you warm at night. You can talk to a friend but in general they dont fuck you and make you scream with pleasure. Tell him what you need, stand in for yourself and do not continue as his fleshlight. If he really wants to spend his life with you, he will change",

            "I can't say if this helps much, but I think you both could find the book \"5 love languages\" by Gary Chapman useful to help you both understand how the two of you operate and some idea what you can do - if memory serves me correctly, it might be a good idea for you to tell him directly that you love it when he touches you during sex - he just has a different idea of how love is expressed than you, but then it's only about communication and understanding",

Later that day, her dad called me and let me know she had slipped into a coma and was not responsive. She died the following day. She went very peacefully. \n\nI just wanted to say thank you all for the kind messages in my earlier post. She was also a student at my school, so I have the blessing to be able to mourn with my community. It will be a long road of grieving, but I promised her I would be okay.\n   \n**tl;dr**: She passed away, but I WILL be ok!\n\nEDIT: \n\nThis got more attention than I thought it would, so I figured i'd give a little more info. The day I went to visit her, she wasn't exactly in a coma, but she was barely responsive. She smiled an made a little happy noise when her mom told her I had come to see her. She was 5'4\" and 75lbs that day. She had a tube coming out each nostril and four coming from various organs in her abdomen, and she was in a lot of pain. I sat by her side and told her how much I loved her and promised her that I would be ok. I told her how I will live the rest of my life with her in my mind. I cried and cried, but rejoiced in the idea that she would soon not be in pain. \n\nShe gave me the confidence to be who I am today. Even through it all of this she taught me to choose happiness. \nThe hardest part of it is just accepting it's over. I am so used to taking care of her every spare minute I had. I see a funny vine or picture And I want to send it to her so so bad. \n\nHer burial was absolutely beautiful. It was just her parents, her sister, and I. It was open casket, so I got to see her face one last time. It really was the closure I needed. There were no tubes coming out of her, the jaundice had faded, and there was not a trace of pain that she wore on her face for so long. A few days later she had her memorial service, which was incredible. There was around 1,200 people that signed the guest book. She was loved! \n\nSince then, it has been a few weeks since and I am doing pretty well. I feel that I am kind of denying things until I graduate, and then I will have time to grieve. For now, I am surrounding  myself with loved ones and staying busy. Thank you all for the kind words!",

            "Hey, OP, I'm sorry for your loss. I wanted to offer some advice on grieving while in school. I lost my dad during college, over a winter break. I was in therapy and on medication when I lost him and it was invaluable. I don't know if you're currently in counseling, but I would heartily recommend it, especially if your school offers a counseling service. (Mine is staffed by professionals, not grad students or trainees, so I can't speak to the efficacy of those programs.)\n\nI take it you're graduating soon (probably May)? If so, try to power through the rest of this semester. I made Dean's List while taking 18 credit hours the spring semester after his death because it was such a wonderful distraction. However, it is *not* a sustainable coping mechanism. I crashed and burned during a few semesters after his death because of how hard it was to deal with his death and school at the same time. If you have more than one semester to go, the counseling recommendation is even more important, as they'll give you other coping skills to deal with her death and your schooling at the same time.\n\nGood luck, OP, and my condolences.",

            "Hey Internet (((hugs))). I'm really sorry that she passed away so fast.  Of course you will be okay just give yourself the space and time to get there. Healing really is a process that isn't linear.  My friend went through this with his gf.  He married her and took care of her for a year.  She died on New Year's Day 10 months after getting married.  He grieved for quite a few years, spent time with friends, surfed a lot and traveled. He met a New Zealander 6 years later and they have a child now and he seems at peace about it but it took a while.  ",
            "I'm so, so sorry. You gave her so much love, and I'm sure she felt that regardless of the proposal. That's what matters. You filled the end of her life with love and happiness. That's more than anyone could ask for. ",

            "My dad died a year before I graduated college (I was 20). Like you, I wasn't able to grieve until much later. Grieving will not take away your feelings for her, thankfully. What's nice is your memories of her will carry you through the rest of your days. Thank you for your touching story.",

            "i'm so terribly sorry for your loss.  at this age, it's just... it's just really unfair.  i'm grateful you have a good support system, and i'm grateful that in her short time here she developed one as well.\n\ngodspeed, friend.",
            "I'm really sorry, man. I know that's just what people say, but we say it for a reason. \n\nMake sure that you don't try to jump into things too quickly, and take some time to grieve. I have no inkling of what it would be like to lose my girlfriend, but I would be absolutely destroyed.\n\nBest wishes, and I hope you can successfully piece things together when you're ready.",

            "ugh, my heart literally sank. You're a good man OP. The update was sad, but the edit is what really hit me. I can't even imagine the pain of seeing the person you love, want to share your life with, waste away before your eyes. \n\nI'm glad you got to be there though. As sad as it is, she was surrounded by the people who she loved the most, and who felt the same. One of the most important things to remember is that it is ok to feel relieved OP, especially since it sounds like she was in such pain. Regardless of what anyone believes, she's in a better place. Sorry for your loss, I wish you and her family only the best moving forward.",
