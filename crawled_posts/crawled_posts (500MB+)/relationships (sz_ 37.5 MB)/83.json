Since around April, he\u2019s been refusing my attempts to have sex most of the time, sitting differently on the couch to where he\u2019s facing away from me... little things. \n\nIt\u2019s with one of our good friends. She came to my house a few weeks ago. She\u2019s texted me. She\u2019s pretended to be there for me. \n\nI found out because I rolled over and they were having a Snapchat conversation. She said she wished she could be there to hold him and he summarized that I tried to seduce him last night and mocked it. I confronted him and he admitted it. He said that it was because quarantine was stressful. He does not want to work things out. He thinks of me \u201conly as a friend in his heart.\u201d\n\nWhen I told her husband, he confronted her and apparently they actually kissed back in February. I think at that moment, I was never going to be enough for him. \n\nWe used to be so so so happy. The week before they kissed, we celebrated Valentine\u2019s Day together. He bought us a nice bottle of wine for our anniversary. We had fun, we were perfect. \n\nI don\u2019t know where to go from here. We\u2019ve been married only about a year. I feel like he took so much from me and doesn\u2019t even want to go to therapy or work this out. I don\u2019t want to leave my house but everywhere in it I see him. He chose her. I\u2019ve been cheated in every relationship I\u2019ve ever been in. He was supposed to be my forever. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve made therapy appointments but I was also laid off last month, so I have too much free time to analyze every single moment where he might have been lying to me or where I made myself pathetic trying to cling to him. \n\nHow do I start to get through this?\n\nTLDR; My husband had an affair and does not want to try to work out our marriage. I feel like I\u2019m drowning and don\u2019t know how to start moving on.",

            "Lawyer first. Get the divorce filed, and get their advice on if it's ok for you to leave the house while things are processing.\n\nAs for the other, you need to fill your time. Devote yourself to hobbies, including picking up new ones. Rely on friends - long video calls, watching movies together, etc. Fill as much of your time as you can until things start to process.\n\nI'm so sorry he gave up on you without even trying, hon. You deserve far better than that. It's a shame some people are so good at hiding how little respect they have for other folk, but please hold onto the fact that *none of this was your fault*. There is absolutely zero reason for a partner to cheat, ever, and there is absolutely no justification that can put even a shred of the blame on you.",
            "You can't go to therapy and work this out. It only gets worked out if both people want to put the effort in, and your husband has made it very clear he's not interested in trying to make the relationship work. He directly told you that. You need to find a lawyer and file for divorce.",
            "Call a lawyer. Relationships take two and he's clearly done.",
            "Have a mantra to help you when things get overwhelming. \n\n\"I'm going to be okay. This sucks but I'm going to be okay.\" \"I am a loyal, trustworthy, hardworking woman, I deserve the same in return.\" \"I am beautiful, I am confident, I am worthy.\" Even if you don't feel they are true in this moment, it will help to say them out loud until they hold truth to you. \n\nI'm sorry you are going through this. You can't trust this man anymore and he is not willing to compromise with you. You deserve better.",
            "I was where you are 5 years ago. \nMy husband leaving me and subsequent divorce was very sudden and traumatic. It took time but eventually I got my emotional shit together and life went on. You'll be thrown for a loop for a while but what absolutely will help is cutting both people out completely. No \"gaining closure talks\", no coffee dates to catch up, no late night texts etc. Block them on all social media and step back from mutual friends. \n\nMake sure you are serious in your conviction that your husband is a stranger who doesn't deserve your time. Same goes for your \"friend\". That means they aren't allowed to weasel their way back into your life. \n\nYou loving either one of them is not an excuse to let them back in your life. You have to accept and understand that fact. One or the other will want some form of contact at some point, they don't deserve that from you. \n\nThrow yourself into hobbies, friends, getting a new job, exercising whatever.",
            "The first thing you need to do is work on what your first step in the divorce will be.  Go talk to a lawyer.  Many offer free initial consultations. You are posting here asking for emotional support - and you do clearly need it - but the main thing you to need to do is get yourself out of this terrible situation where you are married to someone who doesn't give two shits about you.  You will feel better if you start taking definite steps in that direction.\n\nPeople post here all the time about finding out their partner cheated or had an affair but they want to work things out and the poster doesn't know how to trust them.  Your husband is making this easy for you - he doesn't even pretend to want to work on things.  \n\nDon't forget that decision of his even if he later changes his mind and wants to work things out.  He has chosen the other woman in a clear an unambiguous way.  Even if he chooses you later, you already know that doesn't stop him from looking for a better option.  Even if your \"friend\" decides to end the affair for good, you should assume your husband will look for yet another alternative option to you.\n\nTherapy is also a good idea, when you can get around to it.  You might also look around for support groups - maybe r/surviving_infidelity, or maybe a local group of some kind.  Or maybe just a friend or family member or two who you can turn to right now.  (NOT your husband, obviously).",
            "Wow I'm so sorry. \n\nI notice one line that stands out: \"I've been cheated on in every relationship I've been in.\" That really sticks out to me. There's something going on. Yes, it's the dudes' fault. But this + \"everything was perfect a month ago\" says that perception isn't lining up with reality for you and you have a really well developed coping mechanism for overlooking flaws in people and maybe excusing red flags or problems. \n\nI can't really speculate where that came from, but usually people who were told or shown \"reality is what you make it and I **insist** it be okay!\" (my mom was like this) are expert excuse makers, reform school for bad boys matrons, and live pretty deep in denial---I know because I was one. Also people struggling with their own stuff sometimes pick troubled friends as well and tolerate, overlook, forgive or excuse messed up stuff. \n\nA good therapist can work with you to unravel the reasons that led to this in terms of things that you maybe excused or forgave or missed/ignored so it never happens again.",
            "Why are people so gross.  Your husband is gross, your \u201cfriend\u201d is gross.\n\nHaving integrity isn\u2019t that hard.  They are trash masquerading as people.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you.  My father in law did something similar, so did my uncle.  Uncle and aunt stayed together and worked it out FIL married affair partner.  It\u2019s been years and I try to treat them normally, but I just don\u2019t have the respect for them and I can barely stand being in the same room.\n\nThis will happen to your husband and honestly I think it\u2019s a very good reason to not bother working things out when a partner has an affair.  You can be assured that everyone who knows just  barely tolerates the person now.",
            "The only way forward from here with divorce. Your husband is not only a cheating scumbag, but he shows no remorse or desire to fix things, and one person can't hold a relationship together on their own.",
            "Cheating aside, You DO need to go to therapy for the line you dropped at the end about being cheated on in every relationship. Clearly there\u2019s something about you unresolved that allows people that abuse boundaries to sniff you out and take advantage of you.",

            "WOW.  Girl he was really making fun of you for trying to have sex with him. He is SHIT! Don't waste any more time grieving the loss of your relationship with this scumbag.\n\nNothing is your fault. A decent human being would have just been straight up with you when his feelings changed. He made the choice to betray you everyday and continue to use you because it was convenient for him. You would never do this to someone, because we are above people like this. Find you someone who will give you the same respect you give them.",

Most communities have a program for those with limited income. Hopefully you can find something within a reasonable drive time. \n\nMake daily plans and stick to them. Exercise, spend time with those who support you, and try to see him for who he truly is, not as you thought he was. \n\nI know this time sucks, but you will eventually come out the other side for the better.",

Trust me because if you don\u2019t now then later you will randomly think about it and then get upset or feel low all over again.\n\nAlso how you get them is how you lose them. \n\nAnd your husband not wanting to work on things says a lot and in a way is a blessing in disguise.

That fucking sucks and you deserve so much better than a selfish husband who would be so casually callous to you. He can kick rocks and maybe he\u2019ll one day realize how spectacularly he screwed up. I hope you can look back on this a year from now and find yourself in a better position.

            "There is a lot of good, practical advice here.  I am glad you have a therapy appointment.  I am a therapist myself, and that's always the first suggestion I give.  Getting a lawyer is also the right thing to do.  Your post, though, states \"I don't know how to move on\". Unfortunately, that part is a lot more difficult and less concrete than making a therapy appointment and finding a divorce attorney.  \n\nThe only way you can move on is to take it one step at a time.  Be mindful of each and every step, and make sure that everything you do is for your own good.  It appears that your spouse is adept at trying to project blame into you.  Let that blame roll off you like water off a duck's back.  Actually imagine yourself impermeable to his negative energy.\n\nGoing forward, every thought, every decision, needs to be about you.  If you are still living together, find somewhere else to stay, and do not engage him when you leave.  Instruct him that all communication will go through your attorney. Each interaction with him will make it more difficult to move on, and cutting ties complete will allow you to start healing.\n\nI am so sorry that this has happened to you, and I wish you the very best.  If I can be of any additional assistance, feel free to send me a message.\n\nTake care.",

I also had been married about a year when he began acting strangely.  \n\nIt isn't about you.  It is about your husband's inability to be satisfied with his life.  He is most likely a man who loves to chase women.  He needs that thrill and the uncertainty to feel energized and happy. \n\nIn order to survive, I cried a lot.  I journaled.  I left and moved in with a friend.  I learned how to \"unlove\" someone.  \n\nMy ex was like 2 different people: the man I fell in love with and the icky, cold man I was married to.  \n\nWarm hugs for your aching heart.",

Again you could not stop that.\n\nHe is so toxic and it's like a snake bite, the venom takes time to get out of your system. Time does lessen Pain, it may or may not remove it... but Time does Lessen it. Time is a gentle healer, let time do its wonderful work. Again that's something you cannot change.\n\nYou must feel the pain you do, do not suppress as total healing can happen, the old band aid scenario. Pain is a strong advocate for change... Pain, you can run it avoid it or stay there and whatever is causing that pain will damage you more.  If you had stayed that situation there was more pain coming your way... That is something you could and did change. WELL DONE YOU.\n\nThough you may not know this yet, a tremendous burden has been removed from your life. He is a SEP Someone Else's Problem NOW. \nPain comes and pain goes, Character Remains, His character has been exposed, yours is just starting to Shine, You are Loved... END OF STORY. You will Love again, just right now the toxin of his Venom is still in your system... that is something you can change. First breathe fully in and fully out. Remember you had a life before him and you have a life yet to live. A great saying I heard when I was young.

And let go of any shame \u2013 for leaving, for staying, for any of the feelings you felt before the affair or during it or afterwards. None of the shame is yours to hold on to.\n\nEvery relationship has a \u2018make it or break it\u2019 point. Some relationships will have many. Forgive yourself if you missed something. This relationship involved two people. If you weren\u2019t giving your partner something he or she needed, it was up to them to tell you so you could put it right. There will have been times that your needs went hungry too. It happens in all relationships from time to time. It\u2019s the intensity and the duration of the unmet need that does the damage. You deserved the chance to know that something wasn\u2019t right. And you deserved the chance to put back whatever was missing. You have that now. If you aren\u2019t able to give your partner what he or she needs moving forward, forgive yourself for that too. Sometimes two great people don\u2019t mean a great relationship.

Why do you get emotionally involved with men who would consider cheating as an option? Why do you have a \"friend\" who would be willing to put herself between you and your husband? Why do you believe that all was well on Valentine's Day, when it obviously wasn't - he did kiss her the next week, after all. Considering that, he is either an excellent liar, or you are living in a fantasy and you were subconsciously ignoring the realities of your relationship with him. \n\nBefore you rush for divorce, I would empathically suggest accepting his feelings for her, dealing with your grief, and then spending an enormous amount of time and energy looking at yourself. The truth is, if you don't address the reasons why you married a man who saw cheating as an option, why you have been with cheaters in the past, why you didn't see this coming, and why you are surrounding yourself with \"friends\" who would betray you like this, then you will most likely just repeat this cycle all over again even if you and your husband get divorced. Maybe, after you've done all of that, you might find you and him can have a shot at real love. Maybe not. Maybe you will realize you married a man with an irreparable character, and you find someone else. Either way, you will be better positioned for true happiness.",

        "selftext": "Here's the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4g6d8c/i_30f_just_learned_my_husband_31m_has_feelings/)\n\nHi, r/relationships. I know this update is coming fast, but I've made my decision and I thought you'd all like to know. A lot has happened in the past day, but in the end, I think I'm making the right choice. Tbh I think I knew this is what I had to do all along, but I was in denial.\n\nI want to start off by thanking everyone for their advice, kind words, and even tough love. I have decided to end our marriage and get a divorce ASAP. It's heartbreaking and painful for me to do this, but honestly, I don't think I could live with knowing my husband loves another woman *and* assaulted her in front of me. The fact that this is my SIL makes it even worse. I don't think we can come back from this and I would always feel like I wasn't his first choice.. plus, he touched and kissed Kate without her consent, which is an awful thing to do by itself.\n\nI sat down and really, *really* thought about what happened and how it made me feel. It made me feel disgusted, hurt, and angry. It made me feel like an idiot. It broke my heart. I couldn't believe the man I loved, the man I have been with for almost a decade of my life, would betray me and hurt me like this. It almost doesn't feel real. To think we were going to have kids, to think I trusted him and gave him all the love I could. It fucking hurts.\n\nA lot of you suggested that maybe he married me so he could be close to Kate. We sat down last night, I showed him your comments, and he broke down. He admitted to me that yes, he did marry me to be closer to her. It's always been her. From day one of our relationship, it's been a ploy to stay close to Kate. Not only is this devastating to me, but it's extremely creepy and I feel bad that Kate ever had to be around Jack. His intentions were almost predatory.. who knows what he would have done to Kate if her husband and I hadn't been there to intervene. I honestly think he would have done some truly horrible things to her, given the chance.\n\nHe begged me to stay. He promised he loved me, he could get over Kate, he wanted me. I was his soulmate. We were meant to be together. He would go to therapy to work on his issues and we would be okay. He was sobbing and begging and trying to convince me to stay. I wasn't hearing it. I'm done. He's a liar.. he's been lying to me for years. He's creepy, horrible, and I can't live with him knowing what he did and how he truly feels.\n\nI called Charlie to talk to him about everything.. like always, he's here for me. He's incredibly pissed at Jack because of what Jack did to Kate. Kate is still shaken up and upset; she feels violated and her trust in Jack, someone she considered her friend for years, has been destroyed. Charlie told me that if I had chosen to stay with Jack, it was very likely our relationship would have died right then and there. Charlie told me he refused to talk to anybody who believed what Jack did to Kate (assaulted her) was okay or forgivable.. even if that somebody was me. He also thinks what Jack did to me for all these years is beyond cruel and he's angry about that, too. \n\nI still have to contact a lawyer and get things in order. It's only been a day since I've made my decision.. but you were all so, so helpful to me. I can't begin to express how thankful I am for your comments.\n\nIn the end, my brother and SIL are the people that matter most to me. They're my real family, the people who love me, and they're here to support me through this decision. I'm young, there's still hope for me to find someone who sincerely loves *me*, there's still hope of starting a family, there's still time left for all of that. I'd rather take my chances of finding someone new than staying with Jack.\n\nThank you, again, for everything. \n\n**EDIT/UPDATE #2**: Thanks for the condolences and kind words! It really means a lot to me. To address some concerns:\n\n* I will be extra careful and keep an eye out for anything Jack tries to do. Like many of you said, his obsession is unraveling, so he might do something drastic. I'm going to contact my lawyer ASAP to start seeing what I can do, change all of my passwords, get my bank accounts in order, etc. I have also **removed any information of my future whereabouts and plans** as some of you suggested.\n\n* I'm going to book an appointment with a therapist. I feel like it would benefit me and help me work through this whole thing.\n\n* Kate doesn't want to talk to/interact with Jack, but she is thinking about getting a restraining order. Understandably, she doesn't feel safe around Jack at all and would rather have nothing to do with him. She's also going to be extra careful, since she's the person of Jack's obsession and he'll probably try contacting her/doing something crazy. Charlie is there to protect her (he's a former Marine, 6'3\" and pretty dang intimidating), so I'm sure they'll both be okay. We're all here for each other.\n\n* Some people don't believe this is real because of my timeline (I said we've been together since HS in the last post, but then said \"almost a decade\" in this post). This was a mistake, I meant to type \"over a decade.\" I can't prove the validity of my story, so you'll just have to take my word for it. I don't really feel the need to explain myself here. You either believe me or you don't. It's a bizarre situation. I can't explain Jack's behavior any better than you can.\n\n* On the bright side, Charlie and Kate are still trying for a baby, so there's a pretty good chance I'll be an aunt in the near future. There's still hope for me to find \"The One.\" In the meantime, I'm going to focus on me, and moving on from this whole thing.\n\nThanks for the concern and encouragement! :)\n\nTL;DR: Getting a divorce. Sad, scared, but hopeful. Thank you, Reddit.",

He has taken your love and trust and selfishly abused it.\n\nHe's probably going to go into desperation mode very quickly, so make sure to secure a lawyer.

You are a great person, and now you are free of that horrible person. There will be plenty of men that would love to be with you and love you for you.

We both work busy jobs but I'm a writer and I usually work from home or from my office down the street. Our live-in nanny, Ella [45F], has been with us for about six months. She is INCREDIBLE at her job, and she's honestly become part of the family.\n\n\nThe other day Katherine, my husband and I were driving somewhere in the car and my daughter said, \"Want to hear me talk like Ella?\" And she started speaking Spanish! I'm not fluent but I know enough to know that she was really speaking it, not just pretending. I was really impressed and told her great job, keep practicing, etc. My husband didn't really respond but I didn't think anything of it at the time. \n\n\nThen tonight (just now) Ella came to my office after Eric got home and took over watching Katherine. She was really quiet which isn't like her, and she apologized for teaching Katherine Spanish without asking. My response was basically, um...what? I told her (completely confused) that I had no problem with that and I actually think it's a fantastic idea. I wish somebody had taught me when I was little -- especially where we live in Southern California, it's a great skill to have. So I reassured her that I would actually appreciate it if she would keep teaching Katherine the language. Ella then told me that Eric had just asked her to please only speak English around Katherine. \n\n\nElla has gone back to our house for the night, but I'm still sitting in my office fuming. I am beyond furious with Eric, and I know I need to collect myself before going home and speaking to him. First of all, I feel like he's damaged our relationship with Ella, who's been nothing but wonderful to us and our daughter. Secondly, I cannot for the life of me understand why it's a bad thing for our young daughter to learn a very useful second language (which she'll probably have to learn later in school anyway). Eric has never expressed any racism (if he had, we wouldn't be married; that's a dealbreaker for me), but I can't see any other explanation for this. And finally, I am furious that he made the decision to talk to Ella without me. That's not how a partnership should work. \n\n\nA) Where do I begin in addressing this with him?\n\n\nand B) How do I make it clear to Ella that she's free to speak whatever language she wants around our daughter?\n\n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Our amazing nanny has been teaching our 4 year old daughter Spanish, and my husband asked her to stop without discussing it with me first.",

So many of our patients are Spanish-speaking-only, and they are blown away when this white dude with a Jew fro walks in and speaks to them in their native language. He doesn't have to wait for an interpreter like the rest of us. I am *so* jealous and wish I had paid more attention in Spanish class because it's a big advantage to have. ",
            "Keep your temper in check when you speak to Eric, but make it clear how beneficial you think it is for your daughter to learn a second language, especially young when it is so much easier to learn. My mother knew a child in Africa that spoke Arabic (her parents were Egyptian doctors), English (the language of the expat community), and Yoruba (the language of her nurse/nanny). At age three she spoke all three languages with the proficiency you would hope for a child her age, speaking all three languages did not slow her down in any one.\n\nThere is a chance he is thinking this will hurt her continued development in English, I have to hope that this is the case, rather than racism, which is obviously just as likely his reason. ",

See where it takes you. \n\nI don't think you should deceive him, but I worry that you letting him know that Ella told you what he said is going to get him upset with Ella, which will cause problems",
            "Take a deep breath before you talk to Eric.  It could be as simple and stupid as him not liking the idea of Katherine asking him questions he can't understand, let alone answer, which is why my parents stopped my informal Spanish lessons with my babysitter when I was a toddler.  (They admit in retrospect this was a bad call.)  Unless he exposes more bigoted motivations, the biggest problem here is him making the decision unilaterally, especially when he apparently knew you'd disagree with him.  Start by expressing your disappointment in that regard, and go from there. ",
            "I'm bilingual myself (having two native languages, English is not one of them) and I'm raising a trilingual son (hopefully he'll have 3 native languages).\n\nBilingualism is good for practical reasons and that's very obvious to everyone - you'll probably have a better chance to find a job in the future because of your other language, you can communicate with more people from different cultures, etc.\n\nBilingualism is good for your brain development - even if you're teaching your child a second language that is not practical at all (like Klingon) it's still good for your brain.\n\nLearning a second language doesn't have any detrimental effects on your \"first\" language in the long run.\n\nI can provide you with sources if need be.\n\nAs for your husband, he probably thinks that learning Spanish is bad for her English development. That's not true, but that's quite a common misconception. I don't really think you see an ugly side of his. Just a misinformed side.",
            "Part of your discussion with your husband needs to be about how you two need to discuss these things first. He should have come to you first, and discussed this with YOU first. Instead, he went behind your back. That's unacceptable. \n\nFor A) I guess start by calmly asking him his reasons. It's kind of hard to go forward without a \"Why?\" Hopefully, if you keep asking him questions and forcing him to explain himself, he'll realize how absolutely idiotic he's being.  \n\nI have no idea what he'll say, as there is no good reason. Fluent Spanish as a second language is an awesome skill -- I have a friend who learned it young from her nanny, and now owns her own company with locations in the U.S. and South America. A couple other friends speak it fluently and it has opened up numerous career opportunities for them.\n\nAnd maybe there's a chance that Ella misunderstood what he was trying to say?\n\nFor B) -- Your husband needs to be the one to apologize, or to clarify if Ella misunderstood. For your part, you need to reassure Ella that it's ok that she came to you. If your husband is being an asshole to Ella behind your back, it's possible he'll get even worse if he thinks Ella tattled on him. \n",

Just ask him why he doesn't want your daughter to be exposed to another language. \n\nIf he has some reasonable but misinformed fears (e.g. I've heard parents worry about primary language development,  though I'm fairly certain that's a dated view), research it together and come up with an agreed upon approach based on that education. \n\nIf he shows himself to have unreasonable or bigoted opinions, you can be sure it won't just apply to your nanny speaking Spanish.  ",
            "Try to be calm before you approach this issue with him. Before you accuse him of racist views, make sure you ask him to clarify why he has an issue with your daughter learning Spanish from Ella. Address his issue directly and fairly while also providing your reasoning for wanting your daughter to learn Spanish. \n\nIf racism is not the issue, it might simply be that your husband worries that learning Spanish will give Ella an avenue to communicate with your daughter behind you and your husband's backs, and he may feel that his role as a parent is being threatened with this in mind. That belief is sometimes, though not likely in this case, a justified one. \n\nMy mother was adamant that my siblings and I were not to learn the language of my father's family. My father's parents regularly called my mother a whore and a gold digger (despite earning more than my father) and looked down upon her as less than deserving of my father. She feared that, had we learned the language, it would be easier for his parent's to manipulate us and shut her out of our lives by spreading misinformation about her (which they tried to do anyway in broken English, but at least this way she understood what was happening). While I wish I had learnt the language anyway, I understand and support my mother for that decision.\n\nYour husband may have similar fears, but I don't think that they are reasonable in this particular instance. **Whatever you do, avoid mentioning that Ella spoke to you about this**, your husband may see this as Ella trying to win your favour behind his back. Just start with: \"Hey, I wanted to talk to you about Ella and [daughter]. I got the impression that you had a problem with Ella teaching her Spanish, but I actually encouraged her to continue teaching her because it'll be really helpful later in life.

But hopefully it's something more benign, like your husband mistakingly thinking that a young child would be confused by learning another language and her English would suffer. In which case putting his foot down without discussing it with you is still a problem, but hopefully you can help him understand that there's nothing wrong with your kid learning Spanish.",

Esecially at a young age where children are very impressionable and picking up what others are saying around him, it may make him uncomfortable to think about only being able to monitor 50% if what she's exposed to. Maybe you should all try to learn some Spanish! I don't think this is a race issue at all.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm Puerto Rican and my dad opted for an English-only household and I do wish that they taught me Spanish young.

            ">Where do I begin in addressing this with him?\n\nAsk him his reason for not wanting Ella to teach Katherine Spanish.  You're assuming it's racism, but he might have other reasons (whether you agree with them or not is another matter).\n\n>How do I make it clear to Ella that she's free to speak whatever language she wants around our daughter?\n\nHold on.  If your position is that you must discuss this as partners, then you cannot simply go to Ella without talking to your husband either.  The bigger question, though, is what happens if you two reach an impasse and do not agree or cannot persuade the other?  On the one hand, there seems to be little downside to learning a second language (no studies showing that it inhibits primary language skills) and some definite upside (the 2nd language).  On the other hand, you will have to consider for yourself where this falls on the \"is it worth possible hurting my marriage over\" scale.  If Eric is adamantly against this (either for right now or the immediately future), but would agree to have Katherine take Spanish lessons in the future, would you back down or stand your ground?",
            "Is it possible that your husband is more concerned that he may feel excluded as part of the family unit since he may not know Spanish? The act of someone else teaching your daughter a foreign language may make him feel isolated from her (and perhaps you as well, drive you said you also know done Spanish). Being the only non Spanish speaker in the family could create a divide for him that's he's worried about.  Might not be anything racially motivated at all...",

I had a little radio in my room and I would keep it on and read or play in my room and try to say the words they sang. It always made me feel confident and smart to know I was learning from these songs I had never heard before.\n\nMy dad would come in to my room and ask why I was listening to that music and make me turn it off.

            "Why wouldn't he want his daughter to know a second language??\n\nMakes absolutely no sense as it gives a terrific advantage to ones who do know a second  language.\n\nWhen applying for schools and/or jobs it is a great advantage indeed!\n\nAlso - Spanish is used so extensively now that it's a real boon to actually know how to speak and write it too!",
            "Hey husband, I would like our nanny to continue giving our daughter free Spanish lessons. It will help her in school as she'll already know the language when she has to take her foreign language classes, it'll help her in the job market being bilingual, it will help her various places we might go on vacation, and it will allow her to understand what is being said around in her Spanish which could be important for keeping her safe.",
            "I don't know if this has been brought up yet, but honestly there have been studies as well (you can simply google these) that people who speak more than one language become smarter, and I even remember one article mentioning that the brain of a multilingual person works completely differently than that of someone who does not speak at the very least a second language. So aside from the fact that he may be being racist, I would mention that in your talk with him. Hope it works out well! ",
            "OP, he may be concerned about your daughter's English education. I was bilingual before K and my parents decided to focus me on English because having two languages going on began making grammar confusing for me. If you haven't seen racism from your husband then it probably is either something like this or just a discomfort with someone else spontaneously teaching your child things without your consent. \n\nOn the other hand, it's pretty rude what he said to your nanny and it's extremely disrespectful to go over your head. I'd address those with him, non confrontationally, and then feel out his motivations. ",
            "I grew up in as Mexican household and I always talked to my mom in English so she could improve her English.\n\nI never spoke Spanish growing up, but I could understand it.\n\nI WISH I prescribed my Spanish and learned how to speak it as to this day its hard for me to pronounce the words.\n\nYour daughter has a great advantage here and this will help her in the future.",
            "WTF? He's throwing away a massive opportunity for your child. The languages you learn in childhood are so important. You will probably never be able to speak a language as good as the one you learn then. \n\nWTF? WTF? If I were you I'd throw some studies around about bilangual childs. (I'd also scream at him, but that's never a good advice. Holy fuck.)",
            "I'm just going to throw this out there: is it possible your husband is under some misconceptions about how language learning works?  It wasn't that long ago when people thought that teaching a young child a second language impacted their ability to learn their first language.",
            "The best time to become fluent in a second language is at yours daughter's age. Many of us take a few years of Spanish in middle or high school and completely forget it as soon as a we graduate. \n\nIf your husband is being ethnocentric, he is also being incredibly stupid. Living in SoCal (or almost anywhere else in the US) and being able to speak fluent Spanish is a ridiculous advantage to have in both your professional and personal life. Your husband is depriving your daughter of this advantage.",
            "As a female, salary negotiation is daunting. As a bilingual, I have the upper hand. They always up their offer when I explain they'll save money on interpreters. I say absolutely let her learn the second most spoken language in the US, and the most spoken language by amount of countries speaking it. ",
            "PLEASE post an update to this soon, OP. I need to know what his reasoning was. I am 100% on your side at this point, but I feel like there has to be more to this...",
            "If husband was racist, he would have been against hiring Ella in the first place, lest daughter get Hispanic influence.\nThat said, unless you and your husband keep up with Spanish language while your daughter is growing up-through school etc, there is a very good possibility she will lose her ability to communicate. ",
            "So, there's been a lot of focus on your relationship with your husband, OP, and how to handle that. \n\nAnd to touch on that briefly: yes, find out his reasoning. \n   --If it's racism, I'd suggest counseling if you don't want to immediately dump his racist ass. (Because WTAF.)\n   --If it's fear that his daughter will know a language he doesn't, well, he still doesn't come off very well. The idea that children shouldn't have any skills or any knowledge bases that their parents don't seems like a very toxic sort of authoritarianism driven by insecurity. Children are separate people from their parents, and I'm not sure why anyone would want to limit their child from gaining valuable skills just because they themselves don't possess them.\n   --If it's fear that it will hamper her English skills, he's STILL not coming off well. Five minutes of googling could have set his fears about that to rest, and I'm not sure, if you had that sort of fear, why you wouldn't go gather info about it before making a decision. \n\nIn short, he may not be a racist, but if he's not, he sounds impulsive or insecure, and like he's indulging his impulses or insecurities at his daughter's expense. \n\nBut while I was reading your post, my strongest reaction was to worry about Ella, since it sounds like however it was handled, it hurt her. She was giving your daughter (and you, as her parents) a great gift--immersion with a native speaker at a young age can't be matched for effectiveness and ease of learning. (I had a nanny who spoke Spanish, and my parents put me in French lessons at the same time. My French skills never came CLOSE to my Spanish.) Even if you and your husband had agreed that you didn't, for whatever reason, want her teaching your daughter Spanish, it should have been handled with respect for the fact that what she was giving was valuable, even if you had reasons for not accepting the gift.\n\nYou've got stuff you need to work out with your husband, but please don't neglect attempting to address the hurt that (it sounds like) was done to Ella. ",
            "Right now is one of the best times in her life to learn a second language. It's a critical window of opportunity for learning Spanish, mastering the accent, and retaining it throughout her life. Maybe your husband thinks it'll interrupt her English speaking, but this isn't true. Talk to your husband about this. Second languages are much harder to learn later in life, and learning a second language is so incredibly valuable.",
            "I'm basing the following comment on your husband might not be racist, but just concerned about your daughter:\n\nI grew up in a country where having a maid was very common. Almost every house had either a live-in maid or someone who comes in almost everyday just doesn't sleep in the house. They were cheap and it gave the family more time together. Hell my sister had one because both parents worked full time jobs. \n\nAnyway, one of the downsides is that you had a lot of parents that gave the child to the maid to take care of. Over time, a lot of incidents came out where the child was too attached to the nanny or vice versa. This has a consequence of the child not identifying with his heritage and speaking only the native language of the maid. By the time the child grows up, the maid would have a bigger influence on him than the child's parents. \n\nSo maybe your husband is misguided and worried about that. I don't know what his intention is, but it might be something to look into. \n\nWhat I do have an issue with is not discussing it with you. I feel that he might have reprimanded Ella a bit too strongly.\nYou need to ask him why he's against it. Hopefully it's just that and not something worse. \n\nIf it is just that, that he's worried about your daughter picking up more of your maid's culture than her own, then maybe give her a few hours to learn. At this age she will pick it up so fast it will make you dizzy. It'll be a huge advantage for her. ",
            "My dad spoke German and most of his family did as well, but my brother and I weren't taught more than a few words/phrases. Now (in my mid-forties), it's one of my biggest regrets that we weren't brought up to be fluent, or at least conversational. Oh behalf of all the unilingual people out there, if I may be so bold, I say teach her Spanish.",
            "I don't know if this is helpful or not. I'm a Dad, and it is were in a situation where someone presumed to start teaching my daughter something without running it past me or my wife I would definitely be concerned. I feel like that is over stepping bounds. Personally, if someone asked I'd say sure go ahead and teach. But they have to ask. My wife and I need to be aware of who is doing what with our kids, however harmless.\n\nI would however, have spoken to my wife about this issue first, deciding together how to proceed.",
            ">How do I make it clear to Ella that she's free to speak whatever language she wants around our daughter?\n\n\nYou don't get to make that decision without first talking to your husband. That's not how a partnership works (your words). ",
            "Is it possible he thinks Ella's Spanish is too \"low class?\" I've heard this in reference to Chinese, where people are really picky who tutors their child in Chinese because it has to be someone who speaks in a high status sort of way. I also personally knew a couple who, despite being fluent in French with good accents, refused to teach their daughter much French themselves because they wanted her to have a \"native\" accent. ",
            "your husband is a fool. spanish is one of the most used languages on the planet and learning it now will open so many doors to your daughter in the future.\n\nyou need to ask your husband what his reasoning is and why he didn't discuss it with you.  once that conversation is done, then talk to ella. your husband needs to apologize for being a dick and you both need to assure her that you're appreciative of her time and skills and you love that she's giving such a great gift to your daughter.",
            "I like how your first assumption is that he is racist and guilty.  Do you do it often ? ",
            "To start your daughter sounds like an extremely gifted child, and learning a second language would be a great skill ( I would have lived this ) like you have stated.\n\nConcerning your husband I don't think this comes down to racism, from what you've said the only thing I can hazard a guess at is that he may be jealous or feel left out from his daughter. I'm not criticising his skill as a father but you said you both work busy jobs and that could already be difficult for him. With that in mind your nanny is now teaching her a language which is great, but a skill that wasn't by the influence of her father. This could cause your husband to just feel slightly jealous, or maybe useless.\n\nI would suggest sitting down with him and explaining that it would be great for your daughter to learn a new language and it would be valuable for her in her future and he shouldn't limit her, also make sure he is okay and that he can start to deal with the situation.\n\nHope this helps :)\n\n",

If he had a problem with it he should have came to you first so you could talk, and then would have told him what an idiot he is before he made an ass of himself.",
            "I grew up with one language, English. I took Spanish in 8th, 9th, and 10th grades and never put enough effort into it. As a college student later on in NYC, affordable apartments I found were always smack dab in the middle of Spanish speaking communities. My Spanish improved enough to have basic conversations but I'm by no means fluent. I've done a pretty bad job of trying to teach my own kid Spanish. \n\nEven still, now living in an area without Spanish being spoken much at all in suburbia, they are teaching it in schools. My son is learning Spanish in 1st grade. If they are teaching it in the school system here I would bet it's definitely going to be taught in areas where Spanish is spoken. So what's your husband going to do? March into the school and object? ",
            "Is it possible that he just thought it was bad for ability to learn English words and didn't realize she could learn both at the same time?",
            "It might not be racism, just fear. \n\n My parents moved to Germany for work when I was a couple months old. \n\nThey sent me to a local kindergarden to help me learn basic German but later on to a school that taught in my maternal/native language. I remember huge fights my parents picked with the school over which language to prioritize and what to teach us. My parents worried intensely that learning German would lessen my skills in French, that I would not be able to tell them apart. In the end, they got their way, I lost most of the foreign language skills I had acquired in kindergarden in the first two-three years in school.\n\nThey fought hard and long to have it that way and today they fully admit that what they did was wrong. They were scared and thought learning German would keep me from correctly learning French and that mixing the two would prevent me from learning either correctly. They were worried that this would handicap me later in life. In the end what they did somewhat handicapped me, since today I am not perfectly bilingual. \n\nIf he's worried about her English (and possibly also about over-taxing her by making her learn to languages at once), you should have all the arguments on your side. I think research has shown (but please look it up), that kids are best place to acquire foreign languages and that growing up bilingual will make it easier for you to learn new languages in the future. ",
            "This is more common than you would think, especially among older generations. This may be my prejudice, but I feel like fathers are especially prone to thinking this way. As someone else mentioned, it's not that the people who think this way are racist, rather they (1) don't understand how language acquisition works, and (2) feel uncomfortable when their children can speak a language that they don't understand.\n\n\nI hope you two can have a constructive discussion about this that promotes harmony within your family and nurtures your daughter's education.",
            "I hope you're able to get your husband to warm up to the idea of speaking Spanish. I kind of wish I had learned it instead of other languages. I only work retail, but there are still a good number of customers that come in that can only speak Spanish, and I'm sure such a skill would help make her more attractive to employers in the future. She'll also be able to read more books, news in different languages, could even come across opportunities on the street where speaking Spanish comes in handy, have even more opportunities to make friends (having access to Spanish-speaking groups). Learning another language would really open a whole new world for her.",
            "You're daughter sounds very smart and talented. It's wonderful that she is enthusiastic and lucky enough to have the opportunity for somebody to teach her another language at this young age. You'll have to talk to your husband about this calmly and find out why he feels the way he does. From there you can decide how to deal with the issue. \n\nThe egalitarian in me says he shouldn't have the ultimate say in how you raise your daughter, definitely speak to him about making decisions like this behind your back. Hopefully this is just a misunderstanding and you can convince him to think otherwise.",
            "My brother's girlfriend won a semester long scholarship from her U.S. based school to study abroad for a year in the overseas satellite college in Spain. For the first few months it was rough going for her because she really didn't speak the language. It's years later and she is a teacher in the public school system and she still talks about how the learning experience from that trip molded her into the go-getter, try-anything-once, out going, type A/B mix personality she is today. I myself have dealings with several languages and am trying to better those skills with practice, repetition and (expensive) schooling, both home and formal. I know that doesn't directly answer the question of what you should do next. I can only give an opinion that whatever you say to change the mind of your spouse, stick to your guns and show him that it would be an amazing skill for your children to have that will have life-long benefits. To let your daughter learn a language early in life is a blessing and will not only benefit her budding communication skills, the Leadership factor and child like knowledge-desire (wanting to learn a third or fourth language) will make your little girl unstoppable when she goes to university already armed with something that so many of us would pay a small fortune to understand and be proficient in. Please tell us if there is any good news from your endeavor.",

As a father of two grown daughters both of whom learned multiple languages in school, I would've loved to expose them at an early age to a language immersion type training, which you have with a live-in nanny. That young mind will soak this up to a level of fluency so quickly.",

You definitely want good relations with her and it seems like you guys find Ella to be an extended family friend which is heartwarming.\n\nSee if he brings it up first and if not just ask him why he seems upset and what the problem is and then maybe ask him why he told Ella to stop? Honesty is good but I hope he wouldn't become rude to Ella for bringing it up you. The only reason I can see why he'd have an issue is racism tbh? Most well off families pay good money for their kids to get language lessons like French and Spanish, etc. \n\nIf this is the case then discuss with him reworking his morals and feelings. Tell him its racist and you don't tolerate that and he needs to change or edit himself, maybe even counseling? I don't know if that's a thing but ya haha.",

Some people mistakenly believe that learning additional languages negatively affects children's development, probably because bilingual babies are often slower speaking fluently in either language they learn (but catch up later and are of course also bilingual). It's a common misbelief. Also, you may be from a country that's not got a very positive attitude about learning additional languages - I'm in UK and we're really not very into learning foreign languages and there's a lot of ignorance about the benefits.

It's possible that his concerns aren't racist at all. I think the most likely concern is that he feels excluded by your nanny and daughter being able to communicate in a language he can't understand. Personally, I think this is best addressed by continuing the Spanish lessons and also teaching your daughter proper etiquette for multilingual people. The most important rule being that languages should not be used to keep secrets or exclude people. She needs to be taught that many people can't speak Spanish, and in particular Mommy and Daddy can't speak it. She also needs to be taught that it's mean and rude to speak a language in front of people if they don't understand it. So, the proper solution is that she and Ella should exclusively speak English around people who don't speak Spanish, but of course can speak Spanish when they are alone or with other Spanish speakers. This is really basic stuff that multilingual people learn as part of socializing and being taught manners. If there's some other concern, you guys can discuss it as well.

This is absolutely and unequivocally false; children come with language learning software naturally installed. Many parents, for some reason, believe basically the opposite and often bring up a misguided concern over exposing their children to other languages too early or some other such nonsense. I would guess that your husband's motives are probably more along the lines of being worried that his child will be overwhelmed or confused or even held back by that second language, rather than simply being a bizarre and only recently surfacing racist streak that you never knew about. I could be wrong but this conversation happens so frequently between myself and parents that that would be my first guess. ",

Another explanation that I can think of that is a bit less benign, is that he feels threatened by or jealous of the fact that his daughter is speaking a language that he cannot. Just my two cents.",

He would always talk about our hypothetical children going to his parents house to learn to speak Thai, but he refused to teach me any when I asked. I was going to be the only one in the house unable to speak it. They would be able to have conversations right in front of me without me understanding.

My niece, who is 5 years old, was thought English, Spanish, French, Japanese, Taiwanese, and German is able to fluently speak in English without any issues. Just have a talk with you husband, and get down to the main issue as to why he has trouble with it. As for Ella, the relationship between here and your husband is tarnished but it is still good with you and especially your daughter. ",
            "There is no downside to being multilingual. ",
            "People are giving you a lot of reasons in this thread why bilingualism is awesome for kids, but I don't see as much feedback on how to talk with your husband about it.\n\nI'd start with: \"So Ella just apologized to me for speaking Spanish to Katherine. What's going on?\" I'd want to know his reasons first. \n\nIt's possible he's racist. It's possible he mistakenly believes that kids get \"confused\" learning multiple languages at once and doesn't want Katherine to be held back in school (silly reason, but I have a friend whose parents were told this and so they stopped speaking her native tongue at home and she never learned it, which is tragic). \n\nYou can't discuss with him until you know his reasons. So ask him about them and let him talk. Only then can you refute them as needed and find a resolution.\n\nRegarding your relationship with Ella, I'm sure it's nothing you can't fix. Once you and Eric are on the same page, just reiterate to her how grateful you are to have her and how wonderfully your daughter's Spanish is coming along.",
            "I can sympathize with the view of \"don't start trying to teach my kid something without my knowing about it / approving first.\" Maybe your SO was just angry that no one had asked his opinion on this and wanted to regain some control over the situation. It's possible it doesn't have anything to do with Spanish at all, but he felt his role as a parent was being ignored / run-over. I would want to know everything being done with my kids as well before it was done.\n\n> And finally, I am furious that he made the decision to talk to Ella without me. That's not how a partnership should work.\n\nYeah, I wouldn't get on your high-horse just yet. A partnership should be both partners discussing things and coming to a mutual agreement before one of them unilaterally doing anything. Did your husband act this way? No. But did you act this way? No.\n\nYour response to the nanny shouldn't have been: \"oh yeah, ignore what my husband said. Keep doing that thing he told you not to do anymore.\" That not only continues to sideline your husband and undermine any authority he has as a parent, but as an employer, as well. You should be discussing these kinds of things with your spouse and coming to a united decision before proceeding, *particularly* in areas where there might be or is some initial disagreement. That's the partnership part. Don't get all up in arms about your husband not discussing instructions to a nanny with you first when you turned around and in the next breath did the exact same thing by not discussing anything with him first.\n\nYou also just put the nanny is a really bad place. Now she has two parents sending her mixed messages about what to do to keep them happy and keep her job safe. Does she listen to you, or does she listen to your SO? Don't do that again. Take a time-out on the topic, tell her you'll speak with your husband and get back to her about it, and go talk with him. He should not have approached the nanny without first discussing with you, either, but obviously the best way to proceed here isn't to make your nanny some kind of go-between so you and your husband never need to talk about it. Go fucking talk with him and then circle back with the nanny once you've both come to a mutually-agreed on solution to let her know what's up. You should both be in that talk with her, since at this point you've both given her completely opposite instructions. She needs to know you're both on the same page with what she should be doing, and the best way for that to happen is for you both to be in that follow-up conversation with her.",

Now I can't communicate with my family, my cousins tested out with a second language for easy college credit, and it's increasingly useful in the job market. \n\nMy bi and trilingual cousins have perfect speaking skills and are often picked as candidates for jobs in part due to the language skills.\n\nSeriously, it's a great skill and not a hinderance. Maybe open up the conversation with your husband about his concerns and ask your daughter if she thinks 'speaking like Ella is fun'? \n\nSome kiddos play with stuffed animals, other learn life skills I guess! Either way, congrats on your fast learner and her open mind!!",

My little brother can speak fluent Spanish, and I absolutely know that it has benefitted him in so many ways. He's so intelligent, a great reader, really awesome at Scrabble, very curious about the world and just a wonderful guy. It always blows people away that this hilarious freckly red-headed kid speaks fluent Spanish. Im sure knowing two languages has really enriched his life and made him a well-rounded person.",
            "You'll need to talk to Eric, but I suggest giving him some of the benefit of the doubt if he hasn't shown racist tendencies before. Basically, go in listening instead of going in ready to fight. \n\nYou'll have a fight if it's just straight up racism. \n\nHowever, many people are under the (very) mistaken idea that speaking multiple languages harms the development of the child in some way. It could be he just needs to understand that this won't be a detriment in language acquisition in general, and some education could help. I'd call that a potential learning experience over... just straight ugly racism. \n\nBest of luck. You seem to have your head on your shoulders and will be capable of dealing with this. \n\nYou might want to reach out to your nanny in some way- I have no doubt that Eric, well intentioned or not, has damaged your relationship with your nanny. I'm not sure how, but it would likely be important to reach out to her- perhaps set up some dia de los muertos time with the whole \"family\" for this coming November.\n\nBack in the 80's when I was a child, I too had a spanish speaking nanny and english-only speaking parents. My nanny instructed me to not speak spanish in front of them for years- finally my mother picked me up and heard me saying goodbye in spanish to someone or other. My mother was overjoyed- but the nanny was deathly afraid that she'd lose her job. The community knows that a lot of racist fucks are out there, and they're afraid- take extra, extra effort to make sure this nanny doesn't get in her head that she's unaccepted and unappreciated. ",
            "I would just ask your husband why he doesn't want her to learn Spanish. He will no doubt have a silly excuse.  Listen to what he has to say, but when he is does, tell him that your daughter has a greater chance of being successful professional if she learns a second language. Then remind him that children learning languages better the younger they are. Also mention that your nanny is teaching her a skill for free that could cost a lot of money later in life. ",
            "I would spend no time thinking about it until you talk to him.\n\nIt could be something simple and not racism, and if you over think it you'll just end up being really angry when you do talk.\n\nIf you approach the situation giving him the benefit of the doubt then the conversation will go much smoother. You don't know if maybe there's miscommunication here, and Eric possibly asked Ella to only speak English when talking about new things with her that she doesn't know the English name of or something, and Ella misunderstood.\n\nIf it is Racism though, then go ahead and get steamed, but until you know for sure, try not to get worked up!",
            "She should have asked first. Here is my take on this. \n\nMy MIL only spoke Finnish to her son and her husband is American. He lived in a home where he could not understand what was being said. That became a big problem for him as he was a part of that family but was left out of conversations. \n\nWith your husband, your child having the ability to communicate with hired help, an adult mind you, without his knowledge or input is very concerning and you should be concerned instead of applauding it. \n\nYou have no idea what this lady is saying to your kid and just because you trust her fully, does not mean your husband has too. He has the right to be concerned and he has the right to decide what lines your nanny cannot cross. If you two cannot agree on this, then the nanny does not teach your kid Spanish. When two people cannot agree, no decisions are made and since the nanny has introduced this problem, she has to be the one to stop. Reason being, this issue did not exist until this outside person made it an issue. \n\nIt isn't racism you are dealing with here, this is a safety concern and that is how you should see it. ",

Quebec & Brasil I think are the only places that won't be covered, right?  Geez this makes no rational sense at all.\n\nI live in Houston.  I can't tell you how many times Spanish would have come in handy in my life.  You bet your britches my kids are learning Spanish when they start languages in school.

            "I'm a speech-language pathologist working in an elementary school with a lot of Spanish speaking students.\n\n\nChildren are way better at learning languages than adults, because of brain plasticity. It is very good to have a second language growing up, and will probably help in a lot of jobs when she is older.\n\nHOWEVER, a lot of people who are not in my field, or directly educated about language development are afraid that learning Spanish will stunt growth of English. In first learning, your daughter might confuse a few vocabulary words, but she will grow out of it. And knowing Spanish will help with things like root words and English vocabulary. \n\nI have a 3rd grade student where Mom only speaks Spanish and the kid only speaks English. They use a lot of gestures, and Dad speaks both, but they didn't teach him Spanish because they were afraid of English development being stunted. The Mom is one of the best parents...very involved, healthy lunches, always at parent-teacher conferences, but doesn't speak much to her son. We are working on convincing her that he should be learning Spanish.\n\nI think you need to find out why your husband is so uncomfortable with it. If it's worry, then you should do research together about the pros of a kid learning a second language when they are young. It's a concern that makes sense, but the research will contradict that.\n\nIf it's that Ella overstepped her bounds by doing this without talking to you, I can understand that, and kind of agree. Especially if your husband is concerned about the impact on your daughter's development. I think you should talk to her about how it is great to teach her Spanish, but in the future, please talk to you first if she wants to introduce your daughter to new things.\n\nIf it's that he's racist. Then tell him he is being an ass.",
            "Lots of people are stating that perhaps your husband is worried about it affecting your child's English or be strict racism. But would like to add a third possible motive for his actions that he does not want his kid and her nanny to have a \"secret\" language that they communicate in. I know a kid that grew up like that, her mother was bilingual and her father wasn't and forbid the non-English language to be spoken. (It's messed up everyone can agree no need to hash out those specifics)",
            "I'm Hispanic and raising bilingual children in the US, although that second language is not Spanish. I have a few points.\n\nFirst, raising a child to be proficient in a language that is not the country's dominant language is **blood to the end**. Both my wife and I are Japanese speakers (she is native) and speak Japanese at home. While the kids speak Japanese well and have no problems interacting in Japanese with native speakers, they aren't as strong as their peers in Japan. Bear in mind that this is where my kids have the benefit of two Japanese-speaking parents at home with Japanese as the household language. In your case, there are zero Spanish-speaking parents and the household language is English. This means that you cannot reasonably expect the limited interactions with Ella with turn your daughter into a Spanish speaker in any sense of the word. She'll maybe learn some phrases and how to count to ten. To give a real-life example, I grew up surrounded by Spanish on a daily basis and while one of my parents is a native Spanish speaker, the other is not. The end result is that I am not a native Spanish speaker, and I am the only one of my sibling who even has any Spanish. So, don't think you have some golden opportunity hanging in the balance. Based on my experience and the research, I have every reason to believe that your daughter will soon tire of dealing with Ella in Spanish because she knows that Ella speaks English.\n\nSecond, I think it is wrong to frame this as any sort of racism. Spanish is a language, not a race, and it is the second-most spoken language on the planet by all sorts of people. You might as well say that an opposition to speaking English or Russian is somehow racist. In any event, it is not unreasonable for a parent to claim a say in what language(s) his child is raised.\n\nI would also add that it is possible that your husband would have been just as displeased if you enrolled your daughter in trombone lessons or any such other endeavor without discussing with him. This simply may be a decision that he things should have been discussed before you acted unilaterally.\n\nSo, to answer your questions:\n\nA) Find out the reason for his opposition to your idea in a non-accusatory way\nB) Is this even your unilateral call? This would depend on who Ella's employer is. Is it you, your husband, or both?",
            "she could have asked you if it was ok to teach her. I do think a second language would be a great idea. maybe he was just pissed she didnt ask?",
            "If your husband wants to hinder your child from effectively communicating with people, he had better have a damn good reason.\n\nPerhaps he saw the study from a few years ago that indicated that kids who were bilingual had smaller vocabularies...until they were adults, when their vocabularies were significantly broader in BOTH languages.",
            "Are you sure it isn't because he doesn't understand how bilingual kids manage it and he isn't actually just scared of your daughter having difficulties in English at school?\n\nHe might want her to be very eloquent in English and he might be scared that \"Spanish\" words and grammar will take the place of English ...\n\nDo not be too confrontational, it could have nothing to do with Racism. Lot of people who only grew up learning English and don't speak another language might not understand how kids can manage it. There's also the possibility of him being ashamed of being monolingual and feeling threatened? Could be stupid things but not necessarily racism.",
            "Talk to your husband away from your home after you've settled down a bit. Perhaps starting with something like, \"Ella approached me today and apologized for teaching our daughter Spanish. I have to say I was quite surprised by that. Can you tell me why you instructed her to only speak English with Katherine?\"\n\nGive him plenty of time to talk...don't let him off with a short answer.\n\nDepending on his answer you might ask him things like; \"Why do you feel this way?\" Follow up, point out things that are mentioned in this thread like how speaking more than one language can benefit your daughter in a future career or how bi-lingual children have easier times learning other subjects as well.\n\nTell him as well that something else about this situation that bothers you is that he made the English only decision unilaterally. Doing that, you feel has damaged or could potentially damage your marital relationship and the families relationship with your nanny. \n\nThis isn't a small thing and it's my bet it won't be resolved in one conversation. Perhaps therapy will be called for. Good luck to you!",

            "As a fluent bilingual in both English and Spanish, you have no idea how useful until the opportunities to put it in good use come your way. It also opens up a lot of job opportunities. Your daughter learning it at such a young age is incredible and I hope despite this incident (and despite your husband's rather disrespectful input), that your daughter learns this valuable life skill. She's already signs of great progress, which is very promising. A father should encourage their kids to grow and learn, so what the hell is his deal? \n\nI can't say much about what his actual reasoning is behind this is, but I don't believe it to be rational regardless. You can focus on that once you've talked to him, but for now you should focus on bringing this up in a healthy manner (since as you said, you're fuming right now). Once you've got things leveled, prepare to ask him why he talked to your nanny without communicating with you beforehand- as if seemingly he knew you would have a problem discussing something of this nature with him- and then afterwards what his deal is with his opposition. Be concise with your position, and try to reason with him. I'm not sure how a negotiation would play out, but if there is a middle ground, then at least it's better than nothing- even though it's pretty disheartening.\n\nYeah, I don't know. This sounds super weird. Why wouldn't a father want their kid to learn something useful? Boggles my mind. Hope you give us an update, OP.",
            "As other have mentioned, I'd get to a calm place before speaking with Eric about why he is opposed to Ella teaching Katherine to speak Spanish. Thinking racism is the cause is a kneejerk reaction, and the real reasons may be as simple as ignorance towards learning. It sounds like you only have the one child, and I don't know Eric's background, but he may just be woefully ignorant of the developing brain of a child and how easily they pick up new information and that learning more (breadth, not depth) early on will greatly improve her mental aptitude later in life.\n\nBut, there's also the concern that he did not discuss this with you and took actions without your knowledge. He needs to know this is not acceptable behavior. While Ella's actions were incidental and neither of you intended for your daughter to be taught Spanish, if there was any concern about this, it should be been discussed prior to any formal actions being taken. This is doubly concerning because Ella is a live-in nanny, and you've already seen the results of his unilateral actions.",

I got upset but a compromise would be that he learns Chinese too so that he's not left out.\n\nIn addition, I agree with everyone on here saying that learning a another language is very beneficial. I am trilingual (English-French-Chinese) and I learned all languages when I was fairly young and when I tried to learn Spanish when I was older it was a lot harder.\n\nMaybe ask your husband if it's maybe about being left behind.",

            "This is just dumb for so many reasons.  Kids who know more languages always do better on language and literacy tests.  You can get substantial pay increases and have many more opportunities for jobs for being fluent in a language, not to mention the spanish population in America is constantly growing.  It opens up travel to most of central and south America as well as spain, and at least some ability to communicate in Portuguese (yes, I know they aren't the same language but there is decent enough overlap where you could get by).  Plus your kid will inevitably have to learn a foreign language anyway so this gives him a leg up on his grades.  Your husband is acting like a close-minded racist (I realize that is an oxymoron).

Long story short: it's the best time to be learning a second language.\n\n\nMy sister in law had made my niece take French in middle-high school instead of Spanish because she's a snob/closet racist (Spanish being \"the maid's language), I hope this isn't the case for your husband and he's just misinformed.",
            "I get what you're saying, but at the same time, the nanny could very easily decide to teach their daughter something they don't approve of, but the nanny saw no issue with. Which is why they should check with their parents first. \n\nFor example, teaching their daughter how to put on makeup. Yeah, she'll probably use the skill when she's older, but it's not something everyone wants a young child to learn. \n\nI'm not saying there is an issue with learning Spanish. I'm saying there is an issue with a nanny making these decision without consulting the parents. A simple \"hey, I could teach your daughter Spanish if you want?\" is really simple to ask. \n\nAlso, if you had already started teaching someone's daughter Spanish, why would you not tell them? ",
            "I've heard that some people thing that learning a second language will have their first language stunted, so it could be that he's heard that rather than it just being a straight up racist thing.\n\nThere are people who will pay through the nose for multi-lingual nannies because of the career advantages it can give their kids later on.\n",
            "It's actually much easier to pick up a second language if it is taught between the ages of 3 and 7. What your nanny is doing for your daughter is highly beneficial for her later in life. Also the earlier you learn a second language the easier it is to pick up a third or more. Spanish is a Romance language (based on Latin), and has many similarities to French, and Italian. Once she has one the others will come much easier. \n\nMaybe you could tell your husband these things. Stopping the nanny doing what she was doing would hinder not help your daughter. Speaking Spanish in a highly Hispanic area will never not be helpful, best case for a job later in life, worse case if only because people will underestimate her and not expect it. \n\nSpeaking multiple languages also looks good on college transcripts btw. \n\nAs for the nanny, I bet she just wants what's best for your daughter. If you explain that your husband didn't understand the benefits of what she was doing, and you talked to him about it, your's and your daughter's relationship with her should be fine.

I do not have advice for how to handle that, if it is the case. \n\nBut! I would more be leaning towards the idea that your husband is worried your daughter will be confused by learning two languages. In that case, I would (were I in your shoes) try to stress how much easier it is to learn language at this age and ask him to do some research of his own to assuage his fears. If your daughter decides to learn Spanish in high school, for instance, it would be much more difficult for her to approach native speaking proficiency at that age than it would be now.\n\nNot to mention how amazing Spanish is as a jump off to any of the romance languages - eg. Italian, Portuguese, French - all of these languages are related, and blend where countries border each other.\n\nIf you can speak to your husband about the benefits of being bilingual perhaps he will relax and not be concerned any longer. I'd give him the benefit of the doubt and just assume he is worried that she will be confused. ",

Not only does it open you up to a whole new culture (books, movies, tv, etc) and experiences and people (and friends) but it is valuable academically and in the job market. \n\nI took French in high school instead of Spanish (way back in the 70s), I wish I had taken Spanish instead.

You and your husband need to talk about your expectations, agree, and communicate them to your nanny.  \nEdit:Wow, TIL that the statement \"deciding to teach your child a second language is an important parenting decision and not one that a nanny should make without consulting the parents\" is controversial, at least in the US!",

Try and play it cool while he does this so you get all of his views expressed. \n\nOf course you could get lucky, and it could turn out he really just disagrees with many of your child rearing philosophies, leading him to guide things in different directions behind your back. \n\nEither way if you start off by scolding or being disapproving, you'll never get the real reason why he did it.

Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6hc92o/my_26_m_family_disowned_me_now_want_to_reconnect/\n\nI talked it over with my adoptive mother and my partner and I decided to see what my sister had to say. As a few people here suggested, I made a new email address and told her to only contact me there. I also told her I would only respond to her, that I wasn't ready to speak to my mother yet. I asked her why she was contacting me now, why she didn't stick up for me then, and what what she wanted from me. \n\nShe told me that when everything was happening my father had forbidden any of my siblings from talking to anyone about it or attending the trial. Everyone knew I was in therapy for being gay, but he told them that my \"legal troubles\" were because I had run away from therapy and I was selling myself and doing drugs and I refused to come home. None of that is true. I did have a drug problem later, but that's not what the trial was about and I never sold myself or ran away. I had to go to the hospital because I got hurt and the doctors there called the police. I also desperately wanted to come home but they didn't want me back. \n\nEarlier this year my sister was playing a game with her son that she used to play with me when I was little and she realized there was nothing her son could do to make her stop loving him. She started asking my mother why they didn't find me and make me come home, get off drugs, etc. and my mother finally broke down and told her the truth. My sister immediately started looking for me but it took a while to track me down because I changed my name. \n\nShe says she doesn't want anything from me and I believe her. She said she's sorry for what happened to me and that she would have stepped in if she knew. We've been emailing back and forth a million times a day and we've Skyped. She still seems pretty conservative but she told me that she \"watches and enjoys Ellen\" and that my husband and I look sweet together in the photos she saw online. She still lives near the rest of my family, but she might come out here to visit. She wants to meet my partner and she sent a very nice e-card to my new mother to thank her for taking care of me. I'm really happy to have her back in my life. \n\nI'm not sure what to think about my mother. My sister maintains that she really wants to see me and that she's so sorry and that my father made her do it, but she's still with him. And I'm even more hurt now that I know they lied about me. I put up with literal torture for them, and they threw me away and then told my family I was garbage so they would stop loving me too. She kept up the lie for ten years, and who knows how long she would have kept going if my sister hadn't been so persistent. \n \nAnyways, thanks for all the advice I got here, especially from those of you who tried to be understanding about my mixed feelings towards my family. \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: I decided to talk to my sister, my parents lied about what happened.

She is still married to the person that she blames for everything.  She lied and slandered you to people that you loved to isolate and exile you while maintaining her own reputation.  Don't give her a second opportunity to damage you emotionally, to fuck up the good life that you've built for yourself in spite of her.  She is no Christian.  \n\nIf she divorces your father, fully admits her own implicit guilt, and puts herself in intensive therapy, tell her you'll consider talking to her in a year.  Otherwise, put yourself first.  ",

She was complicit in what happened to you and she has not really apologized for what happened. \n\nShe has an equal responsibility to you as did your father.

I think the man can make good decisions on his own. I understand everyone cautioning, but lets calm down a little with the theories the sister is nefarious in her intent or will be in the future.

I feel like she was really trying to help you feel like she wasn't trying to judge you. Plus the thinking about how her son could never do anything to make her stop loving him... she's really coming a long way from her roots.

We can and should choose to only have people in our world who at worst are neutral.  Never allow anyone to take anything from you willingly.  \n\nAs an outside, just a few thoughts to process.  \n\nIs Mom wishing to connect to receive her guilt or because she genuinely wants to know you?\n\nIs mom willing today to stand up to dad and tell him to let her and you be so you can have a relationship.  \n\nRegardless of sister's efforts, she is still an agent for Mom.  If she genuinely is in this for the sake of a relationship between the two of you, she will not pursue, pressure or continue to advocate for mom unless mom makes a full, legitimate apology.

Meet out places or at her hotel. I'd also be prepared for your parents to possibly show up. Maybe just to start out just trying to pay attention to surroundings and keep doors locked and stuff, but also be ready to take measures like getting security cameras or alarms so you can get them set up quickly if needed. \n\nI really hope I'm being overly cautious, but your parents can do a lot with information about you, including making your life hell at your home and possibly actually physically hurting you...

Don't let them ruin it, like most of those kinds of parents do.\n\nAlso, I forget who said it, but I have a feeling your sister is projecting her own guilt onto her mother. The moment your egg donor went along with the shit your sperm donor did was the moment she forefeited any chance of a relationship with you at any point.\n\n(If you do want to be extra, you can add the condition that they have to tell everyone they know and everyone they lied about you to about what they said (lied) about you and what they were using those lies to cover up.)",

The reality is that people who throw away their children probably aren't going to expend the effort to go out and attempt to hunt them down.  I am not saying that you shouldn't proceed with caution with your sister so that you don't get emotionally hurt, but that caution should be...don't put unrealistic expectations for \"family bonding\" on your meeting.\n\nI think it speaks well of her that the minute she found out the truth that she sought you out and her having her own children made her realize there is nothing a child could do that should cause the parent to stop loving them.  She might be conservative. That doesn't necessarily mean she's hateful or not open to accepting you and your partner.

I really hope your life has improved drastically since then and that you are doing well.\n\nAnyway, I can understand the whole situation from your sister's perspective. It's very easy for parents to manipulate their kids and at the time. she probably believed them since they were her parents and kids generally trust what their parents have to say. I'm glad she saw through their bullshit and it seems like she has tried very hard to contact you again and that she wants to have a good relationship with you.\n\nAs for your mother, that's really up for you to decide. It's possible that your mother continues to stick by your dad because of religious reasons and was brought up to believe that she can't divorce once she's married. My friend's ex-boyfriend has an abusive father who is physically and verbally abusive towards both him and his mother. His parents are Jehovah's witnesses and the mother believes she can't leave him because it is a sin, even though she recognizes that he's an abusive asshole (My friend's ex-boyfriend was abusive as well, but that's another story for another time). It's also possible she's scared of being alone and even though your father is an asshole, at least she has someone by her side and did what he said out of fear.\n\nYour mother hasn't tried to contact you directly which may suggest that she does feel shame for what she did and knows you're angry with her. Maybe one day you could try to have a conversation with her about the whole situation and see what she has to say about it. Your mother might feel awful about what she did to you or she could possibly just want forgiveness to satisfy her own ego, but the latter doesn't really sound like the case. Use your own judgment and see if she truly is sorry for what she did and if you think she is deserving of forgiveness or not. It's up to you whether you want to revive your relationship with her or leave it in the grave. Do what you feel is right and don't let anyone force you into a decision you don't want to make."
