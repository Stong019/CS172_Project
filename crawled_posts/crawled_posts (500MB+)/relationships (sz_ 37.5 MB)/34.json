        "selftext": "original post is here,\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26pydf/my_bf_m25_wont_ask_for_my_hand_and_my_dad_m48_is/\n\nThe wedding went on as planned.  My parents stuck to their guns and boycotted.  One of my two sisters attended and is now happily blacklisted from our family.  Nobody else from my entire family showed up including my two brothers.\n\nThe wedding was a little unconventional.  My sister walked my husband down the aisle and then his sister walked me down the aisle.  I wanted this because my SIL actually introduced us and helped me get my first date with him.  There was no questioned about who gives away the bride or even about objections.  It was normal other than that.  There has been no contact between me and my family, other than my one sister.  My mother has made it a point to send me a card every time that they have a family gathering for holidays or birthdays at their house to let me know that my father says I'm not invited.  I get one almost every month.  I don't even read them anymore I just toss them.  I don't why they keep sending them because I've made no effort to contact them and I live over three hours away so it's not like I will run into them by accident.\n\nThe reason I came back to post this here is because some people here made a prediction that came true (that they would come crawling back when we had children).  I am now expecting our first child, a girl :).  She will be the first grandchild for my parents.  My parents found out about the pregnancy a few months ago through a family friend.   They didn't waste anytime in making demands, not requests, demands.  My boyfriend and I are not religious but I had a Catholic upbringing.  I don't practice at all by choice.  My mother called me back in April telling me that my father wanted our daughter's middle name to be his mother's first name.  I said no.  My father was listening in on speaker so I went ahead and told them that they were officially uninvited from all birthdays, graduations, and any other important dates in her life.  My father called me half an hour later crying and begging me to come stay with them for the birth so my mother could care for me.  I said no.\n\nHe also said that he had already made arrangements for his priest could baptize her at his church but that I needed to agree to naming her after his mother if I wanted this to happen.  He said he'd already planned a big celebration for the birth and the baptism that he was paying for.  I said no to all of it.  He went from meekly trying to sweet talk me to raising his voice at me and I hung up.\n\nHe called a couple of more times to apologize for losing his temper and again beg me to reconsider giving birth at a hospital near them so they could visit us.  He denied having any knowledge of my mother sending me cards to uninvite us to any family functions and even said that he specifically asked her to invite us but he was told I declined every time.   He lets my mom do the dirty work so he can later hide behind her and deny he had any knowledge.  He's done this since I was a little girl.  He does this every time he wants to drop the hammer on somebody but be the good cop also. He'll never change.  He denied having any knowledge of why anybody in the family missed my wedding.   I told him our daughter would not be baptized, or catholic at all (no offense to Catholics).  I told him he was too manipulative and controlling and I didn't want my daughter exposed to that.  He's too toxic and just venomous.\n\nCoincidentally, the day and for several days after that phone call I got tons of calls and emails from my brothers, their wives, my sister, and all my aunts.  They all wanted to apologize for missing my wedding, and all had specific excuses, and wanted to make plans to be there for my daughter's birth.  I banned them all from her life until she's old enough to decide for herself to let them in.\n\nMy husband was a little surprised and not sure about banning everybody forever.  He's more leaning towards supervised visits if they want to drive to us.  My dad has been calling him like crazy but we are a united front.  My husband is deferring to me but giving me ideas as to how I can give a little if I decide to.  But with my family there's no giving a little.  They want it all.  For now, they're all banned.  I will reconsider when the youngest of our children turns 18 :).  For now my dad will have to settle for sucking up to my husband while I stick to my guns.  Unlike him, I don't mind owning my decisions even if it means I'm bad cop.  I'm not ready to give up a relatively drama free, stress free life to allow my dad and all his sheep back into our lives. \n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Nobody in my family showed up to our wedding other than one of my sisters.  Everyone is banned from our lives.",

            "Is there anything more satisfying than reading about assholes having to deal with the consequences of their actions? I don't think there is. Good on you, OP, for setting your boundaries and sticking to them. Keep building an awesome life for you, your husband, your daughter, and your chosen family. Don't waste another thought on those jerks.",

They might try and force a visit on you in hospital if they can figure out roughly when and where you'll give birth. They'll likely come to your house when the baby is born.",
            "You are a total badass, OP. \n\nI'm sorry you're having to go through this kind of thing with your family. I'm also glad and impressed that in under three years you've been able to recognize how terribly toxic many of your immediate family members are, draw up reasonable boundaries, and stick to them even over time. My spouse had to go through a similar process and it was really tough on him. So here's an internet hug of solidarity for you if you want it. :) Best wishes for you, your spouse, and your growing family!",
            "This is the very best kind of update. It also took YEARS. Congratulations, OP. May you and your husband always communicate and defend the other this beautifully. You sound like you'll be a great mom.",

            "Just remember when you give birth to notify the hospital that these family members are banned from visiting you.  I guarantee you that they will try and find out where you're giving birth, and ruin your first moments with your child.  It's better to just think ahead and let hospital security deal with their narcissistic drama.",

They weren't there to witness your union so they don't get to witness the development of your family. Your parents and siblings (besides your sister) deserve absolutely nothing from you. I'm proud of you for having such strong boundaries, so many people on this sub let their controlling psycho parents stomp all over them again and again and again expecting a different outcome.\n\nThe last thing you want is for these people to be involved in your life while you're raising an infant.

            "Wow...that is *quite* the update. (Congratulations on your marriage and pregnancy, btw!) \n\nI think you're doing the right thing. Given that you understand how your parents operate, and can thus infer what's going on behind the scenes, I say continue with your current game plan. Your parents know *exactly* how this all came to be. I'd take the liberty of explaining it to your other relatives if it comes up - although their autonomy seems to be at your father's disposal. :/ \n\nAlso, you might enjoy the subreddit /r/justnofamily.

            "You need to find the source of the info leak (who told them you're pregnant), and address that. You don't want that person giving them info about the baby, pics, etc if you don't want them to have those things. \n\nYou and your husband need to decide what your social media policy about the baby will be. If you don't want your parents having any info at all, then you may want to consider having a \"no baby stuff on social media\" stance. Because pics rarely stay private and if they're truly determined to get info about the baby, they may be able to convince someone you're still in contact with  to get that from your Facebook. \n\nNot all hospitals have a policy about disclosing if someone is a patient or not. Some will tell a person who calls and asks for you that you're a patient there. Make sure the hospital you give birth in knows you do not want your name disclosed and give them a list of people who are absolutely not allowed to visit. \n\nI've got a batshit crazy father so I've got a lot of experience with making sure he and his family can't get personal details. One of his brothers went so far as to find my maternal grandparents on Facebook and since their profiles are not set to private was able to pull pictures they'd posted of me and my husband and my sister and her son. I had my cousins show them how to lock down their profiles after that. ",

            "It's probably been said a million times, but in regards to the original post, all those things that your father did in his mind that we're accommodating, were actually manipulative methods to regain control, by a control freak.

I'm a happy, practicing Catholic (I actually work for the Church too) and am horrified of all the demands your parents are making regarding baptism and naming. This would never be acceptable at my parish. We have a requirement for all the sacraments and classes that the parent (for infant baptisms) or individual (for \"becoming Catholic\" classes) MUST be the one to give their full consent. No amount of parental involvement would ever be allowed to push the faith on people because in the end, we want people to be Catholic because they love it, not to appease anyone. I don't even let the confirmation kids bullshit their way through the class. So, on behalf of the church, I'm so so sorry that your parents think it's even remotely acceptable to force your hand. They are acting 100% contrary to the spirit of the church, that is, to love completely\u2014unselfconsciously\u2014without ANY regard to what they get out of it. /rant",

            "Just in case, pasting this post in the comments: \n\n> original post is here, https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26pydf/my_bf_m25_wont_ask_for_my_hand_and_my_dad_m48_is/\n\n> The wedding went on as planned. My parents stuck to their guns and boycotted. One of my two sisters attended and is now happily blacklisted from our family. Nobody else from my entire family showed up including my two brothers.\n\n>The wedding was a little unconventional. My sister walked my husband down the aisle and then his sister walked me down the aisle. I wanted this because my SIL actually introduced us and helped me get my first date with him. There was no questioned about who gives away the bride or even about objections. It was normal other than that. There has been no contact between me and my family, other than my one sister. My mother has made it a point to send me a card every time that they have a family gathering for holidays or birthdays at their house to let me know that my father says I'm not invited. I get one almost every month. I don't even read them anymore I just toss them. I don't why they keep sending them because I've made no effort to contact them and I live over three hours away so it's not like I will run into them by accident.\n\n>The reason I came back to post this here is because some people here made a prediction that came true (that they would come crawling back when we had children). I am now expecting our first child, a girl :). She will be the first grandchild for my parents. My parents found out about the pregnancy a few months ago through a family friend. They didn't waste anytime in making demands, not requests, demands. My boyfriend and I are not religious but I had a Catholic upbringing. I don't practice at all by choice. My mother called me back in April telling me that my father wanted our daughter's middle name to be his mother's first name. I said no. My father was listening in on speaker so I went ahead and told them that they were officially uninvited from all birthdays, graduations, and any other important dates in her life. My father called me half an hour later crying and begging me to come stay with them for the birth so my mother could care for me. I said no.\n\n>He also said that he had already made arrangements for his priest could baptize her at his church but that I needed to agree to naming her after his mother if I wanted this to happen. He said he'd already planned a big celebration for the birth and the baptism that he was paying for. I said no to all of it. He went from meekly trying to sweet talk me to raising his voice at me and I hung up.\n\n>He called a couple of more times to apologize for losing his temper and again beg me to reconsider giving birth at a hospital near them so they could visit us. He denied having any knowledge of my mother sending me cards to uninvite us to any family functions and even said that he specifically asked her to invite us but he was told I declined every time. He lets my mom do the dirty work so he can later hide behind her and deny he had any knowledge. He's done this since I was a little girl. He does this every time he wants to drop the hammer on somebody but be the good cop also. He'll never change. He denied having any knowledge of why anybody in the family missed my wedding. I told him our daughter would not be baptized, or catholic at all (no offense to Catholics). I told him he was to manipulative and controlling and I didn't want my daughter exposed to that. He's too toxic and just venomous.\n\n>Coincidentally, the day and for several days after that phone call I got tons of calls and emails from my brothers, their wives, my sister, and all my aunts. They all wanted to apologize for missing my wedding, and all had specific excuses, and wanted to make plans to be there for my daughter's birth. I banned them all from her life until she's old enough to decide for herself to let them in.\n\n>My husband was a little surprised and not sure about banning everybody forever. He's more leaning towards supervised visits if they want to drive to us. My dad has been calling him like crazy but we are a united front. My husband is deferring to me but giving me ideas as to how I can give a little if I decide to. But with my family there's no giving a little. They want it all. For now, they're all banned. I will reconsider when the youngest of our children turns 18 :). For now my dad will have to settle for sucking up to my husband while I stick to my guns. Unlike him, I don't mind owning my decisions even if it means I'm bad cop. I'm not ready to give up a relatively drama free, stress free life to allow my dad and all his sheep back into our lives.\n\n>tl;dr: Nobody in my family showed up to our wedding other than one of my sisters. Everyone is banned from our lives.\n",
            "I like your your boyfriend. I also, think that banning them forever seems a bit extreme, but then again you know your family, and if you say that if you give them an inch they will take a mile, Ill go with your judgement.

They need to no why grandma and grandpa are not nice people and should not be trusted because I wouldn't put it past your parents to try to abduct them one day. So, whenever you enroll them in school, it would be in your best interest to inform school officials that their \"grandparents\" are not approved guardians and should never be allowed to pick them up from school.  Same goes for any future daycares and babysitters.\n\nIt may be a bit overkill, but based on their previous behavior, I wouldn't put it past them to start to see you and your husband as the enemy, as \"unfit\" parents and try to \"save\" their grandchildren from you.",

So, as long as they make it clear that they are willing to reconnect on your terms, rather than be overly controlling as your parents are, I don't see why you can't accept their apologies and take it one step at a time, increasing contact if they continue to show that they can be respectful.\n\nYou could try laying out really clear limits for what you think is acceptable contact, such as \"Aunt Sally, you are welcome to visit the new baby as long as you come to our hometown/hospital, agree to stay for only x amount of time (which the nurses can enforce for you) so that we can rest, and agree to not discuss any issues regarding baptism\" or whatever conditions would make you comfortable. Your husband and the nurses could help you enforce the limits and kick out/uninvite anyone who refuses to play nice, but if your brother/aunts are truly sorry and want to be better to you, this would give them a chance to show that they are willing to do it and slowly build back trust.\n\n>I'm not ready to give up a relatively drama free, stress free life to allow my dad and all his sheep back into our lives.\n\nUnlike what a lot of people on this sub say, I think that totally cutting people out and placing blanket bans usually causes a whole lot more drama than it solves. There are particular cases where it's necessary (I work with abuse/trauma victims, so I do know about abuse cycles and that sometimes abusive families have to go), but it is a nuclear, last-resort option after all of your reasonable attempts have failed. I can't say whether it's time for that with your parents yet (it may be), but I think for your other relatives, at this stage in the game a total ban will only increase the drama level in this situation.\n\nI think that people are really gung ho about your response because it can feel really gratifying to watch someone take a big stand against overbearing people. Many of us DO need to speak up more in a lot of situations so it feels great to watch someone just go balls to the wall. But in your actual life, taking the middle road is usually more effective, even if it's less satisfying to read about on the internet.",

You're doing the right thing, and your husband was absolutely right on his reasoning not to ask your dad's permission to marry you in the first place, and your family's reaction to it only further proves that they didn't deserve a say anyway. The whole premise of the archaic tradition is the belief that women are property, and that is sexist and quite frankly disgusting. People are not property. What they initially did was bad enough, but now they have the audacity to demand back in so they can expose their grandchild to the same toxicity they've shown you? Keep them banned.

Let your children decide on their own when they are old enough to understand the nuances in the story.\n\nJust because they are related to you does not mean you have to have them in your lives or love them. Best thing I did was cut out 90% of my narcissistic familly about a decade ago.",

            "Great that you're sticking to your words, and being a truthful and consistent person. You have no idea how rare and important that is for children. They can learn all about deceit and manipulation from all the poisonous people they'll meet in their lives, but having a place to come to at the end of the day, a place and people they can trust no matter what, is a life-raft they can keep with them for any surprises that life will have to offer. Just like how it took your stay away from home and with your boyfriend to realize that your family wasn't normal, so too will your children learn from you what is normal until they're old enough to figure out for themselves what's right and wrong.\n\nAnd just in case you haven't thought of it yet, you should be aware of the trouble that comes with 'free' gifts. Manipulative people like your father will often use gifts to secure favors. They give it freely with a smile on their face, telling you it's a gift and something they want you have because they're awesome like that, but the moment they need something from it, they'll invoke the debt you inccured by accepting their gift. You can always tell them to fuck off and keep the gift, but it'll still be a cost to your mental health.\n\nNot only that, but it could also spell trouble depending on what it is they're gifting you. For example, in the case of school, care and medical expenses for children, it might give them authority over choices made regarding those services. Keeping track of it all and guaranteeing that you and your husband are the only ones capable of acting as guardians for your children will probably be a headache, and even without the 'gifts', you'll probably want to ensure that you two are the only ones allowed to pick up your children from day-care, AND that your parents in specific are not allowed near your children. If you're in financial trouble, however, it might help to arrange for your parents to gift you the money so you spend it yourself. If they spout sayings like \"beggars can't be choosers\", you can tell them you disagree with that. Parents can chose to support their children and their families, but it's a terrible parent that would sell their childrens autonomy.",

The bottom line is that they aren't sorry. They're trying to manipulate you to get what they want. They'll keep doing it. And they'll do it to your child too. As hard as it is, you're doing the right thing. Sometimes you have to let family go to live a healthy and happy life.\n\nP.S.

I like that your husband didn't want to partake in a seemingly sexist tradition. You are not property. I did find it funny that even though his decision started this (don't mean that in an accusatory way), he thought complete no contact with your family was a little much. Damn, all the stuff the immediate family did, not to mention the fact the rest of the family fell in line, sucks. People who have never been victims of manipulate and abusive families wouldn't understand. They should keep their opinions about your decisions to themselves if they can't at least attempt to have empathy or understanding. \n\nI would say that based off another person's comment, if you have any extended family that has been good to you but just went along with the boycott (maybe they were fed lies?), maybe reach out to them. Make sure they apologize and mean it and give boundaries. If you believe they will feed info or pictures to immediate family you want no relationship with, keep info limited or continue with your boycott. It's a very nuanced situation, especially if there is family you wanted a relationship with but your still mad about the wedding. If you choose to keep them all out of your life, good luck. Only you know every detail about how they are, so don't mind the negative opinions of people who aren't effected in any way. I wish you all the best and hope you make the best decision for YOU and your new family. :) \n\n(I'm not very good at articulating my thoughts, so sorry if it's confusing and all over the place lol) :)",

I did this not because it was something that was important to me, but out of respect to my wife and her family.\n\nI agree that your parents reaction after being stiffed was immature and petty, but it seems like the original conflict that caused this huge riff was a small one. I'm sure your boyfriend had his justifications for not meeting with your parents, I just can't understand why that would be the thing that he would choose to burn the bridges.\n\nI feel very sad for your daughter, who appears to be missing out on a full family childhood because of a feud that seems to have originated over something that very easily could have been worked out with any semblance of maturity.",

When I tell people that I got kicked out because of my occupation, they always think I went into something drastic like porn or something. But nope. I'm a filmmaker.\n\nSome context - my parents are African immigrants (Nigerian dad, Kenyan mom). I have three older siblings. The oldest is a doctor, second oldest a lawyer and third oldest an engineer. I was supposed also to into engineering (structural). I studied it in college. My parents were dead set on me becoming an engineer like my sister.\n\nA lot of African immigrants who come to the West want their kids to have jobs like those my older siblings have. When I graduated, I told them I was going to try my hand at filmmaking. When I was in college, I dated a chick who was going to film school. She was an editor and she introduced me to filmmaking. I fell in love with it and began learning as much about it as I could. That summer I worked my ass off and bought myself some equipment and just started shooting. Everything and anything. It's amazing how much you can improve at something when you do it over and over again. Even shooting things as mundane as flowers made me a better cinematographer.\n\nI began gaining ability with the camera and during college in my free time, I started shooting stuff like music vids for local artists, corporate videos, short documentaries. By the time I graduated I felt confident I could make a living in this trade. \n\nI was so scared to tell my parents of my decision. My dad had been talking to his friend (also an engineer) and they got me an internship at his firm. Around the same time I was offered to shoot a feature length documentary in a few countries in South Asia for six months. I chose the latter.\n\nIt didn't go down well with the rents. We had a big argument and they kicked me out. They told me I was wasting my time with filmmaking and that it would leave me penniless and on the streets. At my sister's wedding (a year later) they refused to talk to me. Acted like I didn't exist. That was the last time I saw them.\n\nWhen I got kicked out I had just graduated from school. I didn't have much. My brother (the lawyer) took me in and I stayed with him for 16 months while I worked in order for me to get my own place. I'll never forget what he did for me. My other two siblings also thought I was wasting my time with filmmaking and but he was the only one who was so supportive and had my back throughout everything.\n\nThings are good now. I'm financially independent. My career is in a good place. Getting a steady flow of jobs. I'm also engaged and get married next year. \n\nThe other day I got a message from my mom, asking how I was. She also apologized for everything that went down. She wants us to meet next weekend. She said my dad is too proud of a man to say that he wants me back in his life, but that is certainly the case.\n\n**tl;dr**\n\nI haven't decided on the course of action I'm going to take. I'm inclined towards meeting her. I do miss my parents. Even though I am still hurt and angry towards what happened. And smug too, I'll admit. They thought I would fail. Almost prayed for it to happen. It didn't. How do you guys think I should approach this thing? How do I approach the meeting with my mom? I've been thinking about it over and over again. I'm nervous.\n---\n**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question",

You are in the drivers seat, if they aren't contrite or don't offer any sort of apology -- you don't have to let them back into your life. They are the ones who have to prove to you that they're worthy of being in your life -- not the other way around. \n\nAlso, having them see you as a successful DP will prove how wrong they were. \n\nGood luck!",

            "Wow. First of all, congratulations! It sounds like your life is going in amazing directions, and it must have taken incredible strength, courage and talent to pursue your dream with such fetters in place.\n\nI can see so much of my husband in you. He comes from a strict Asian background where he was expected to be a doctor like his father. I know the pain it caused and still causes him when he is constantly looked down upon for his choices. But you know what, he is HAPPY with what he does. He loves it. And that is what is important to me. I do not know what he feels and went through because my parents are so supportive of me and let me pursue whatever I wanted as long as I was happy and able to grow and stand on my own. I love so much what I do (teaching) and am thankful everyday for that support. When you love what you do, it's never a job. It's so much more, and you are one of the lucky few in the world who have that!\n\nI am so sorry you did not have that support except from your brother. He is the one who stood by you and truly has your back. I always say in any relationship, whether it be love, familial, amicable, whatever, you should always want to support and never tear down. Ever. You should want what is best for the person for sure, but toxic and destructive behavior such as what your parents and other siblings showed is so very destructive, and sometimes irreparable.\n\nIt is up to you how you want to proceed. If you feel like you are in a good place to reestablish contact, go for it! Talk it over with your fiancee, whomever. Look at all of your options. But also be prepared (as was in my husband's case) that old demons will pop up again. You may face the same discrimination and toxicity again from them and make sure you are ready to deal with that as well.\n\nSorry for the novel length answer, lol! I wish you the best and hope you are able to find peace in all aspects. But know you are loved and supported by your brother and fiancee--that is true. Your parents and siblings need to EARN that love and respect back from you. If you are ready, then start walking across that bridge. If not, by all means, do what is best for you. Best of luck and let us know if you have any films coming out! :)",

I was not a doctor, engineer, nurse, or anything he wanted of me not even a Muslim. I had so much internalized guilt and shame, I ended up homeless and on drugs. But I turned my shit around and have it together now. I\u2019m a parent now and I see things a little bit differently. Bringing kids to a new country and working their asses off so we can have a better life does bring a sense of pride, however it\u2019s so toxic to hold children to be what we want because of what we do for them. My dad couldn\u2019t see past that for a long time, his life has honestly been very sad. Now days my dad has learned to accept me for who I am, despite his cultural narrative and his pride. We have an authentic relationship now, with plenty of boundaries and no longer hear judgements. I\u2019d say give it a try but be firm on what you will and will not listen to or be treated right.",

They threw you out when you needed them. They turned their backs on both you and who you wanted to be. And now that you are doing okay, getting married, may potentially have kids, and perhaps are capable in assisting with taking care of them in their older age, they may have a use for you. \n\nMy family did something similar to me, and the problem with people in general is they are apt to repeat the same behavior.

If the main purpose of this turns out to be to ask you for money...then they are back because they want to use you.\n\nAlso beware the bait and switch: likely starting with a love bomb to lull you into trust and security...followed by renewed attempts to control your career choices. This would  mean they want to regain control of you and realized they can't do that without maintaining a relationship.\n\nThey owe you at LEAST an apology for withdrawing support from you as a control attempt when they should have been supportive. If they go in expecting an apology from you for not becoming an engineer like they wanted, this is another sign they are here to try to take back control of you for their own purposes.\n\nHere's hoping it's nothing like that and all good.

If they can prove to you that they are genuine and *respectful* of you, then is time to consider introducing fiancee. (One of the rules of surviving a relationship where at least one side has problematic parents: The one with the problem parents is solely in charge of both dealing with their parents and protecting their partner from any negative influence from their parents. Another rule is fiancee's wants and needs come before those of your parents, always. Stick to those two and it'll give you and your marriage a stronger backbone.)\n\nP.P.S. r/raisedbynarcissists can provide more specialized support with this issue, and will respond with more depth and detail than I did.

            "I am in my 70s. I left my family (not dramatically, just making life choices that kept me at a distance) when I was 18. I so much miss having a family around me now. However, at the time I felt I needed to save myself from them. It seemed the only choice I could make. My advice to you is: if you can have a relationship with them and still create a life that feels right to you, you should forgive them and maintain a relationship. But always continue to make choices that are right for you, don't be their puppet. They may treat you differently now.",

There\u2019s a lot of pressures and expectations that are thrown at you and a lot of people just wouldn\u2019t understand. My parents were the exact same way. My entire family was made up of engineers and nurses, so my parents thought I was insane when I mentioned to them I wanted to be a teacher. They tried many times to pressure me into another career or re-think my decisions but I stuck it through and now I\u2019m about to wrap up my 2nd year of teaching. My mom finally came around and she is one of my biggest supporters. I always text her when I get nominated for awards/honors at school or if I\u2019m having a bad day.

            "My (35f)parents are middle eastern immigrants and tho they didn\u2019t disown me (I\u2019m an engineer but I work in a different field because of the financial crisis wiping out every contact I had). So I didn\u2019t get disowned but I do recognize some of the things you\u2019ve been struggling with.\nOur immigrant parents move to another country and become a more extreme version of what they would\u2019ve been had they stayed I their own country. They hold onto ideologies and culture like it\u2019s the last thing they have (which to be fair, in some cases is actual true). They pressure their children because they sacrificed a lot so their kids could have a better life than they would\u2019ve had.\n\nIn all this struggle and hardship they forget that their kids are not what they would\u2019ve been if they\u2019d stayed in their own country. The kids grow up with western mentalities and culture (normal of course). \n\nSo I\u2019m not trying to excuse away your parents treatment of you, which was terribly unkind. However, I\u2019ve seen in my parents how age can mellow them and see the error of their ways. They\u2019re now no longer in the thick of raising children and worrying about them, which leads to more time for self reflection. Revisiting old memories and rethinking old ways. It\u2019s possible that your mother truly feels bad. It\u2019s mostly fear of the unknown. And people who live and make decisions that are fear based don\u2019t make the best decisions.\n\nLook if you meet with her and realize they\u2019ve not changed you can always limit contact again. I\u2019m writing this out because I recognize the hurt you describe, and to me it was very important to understand why they did what they did and why they said what they said. Hope everything works out between you and your parents :)",

She wants access to those grandkids.** I don't think she has changed at all--she's just doing anything she can to get back in your good graces. At best, this whole thing may wind up with her and you staying on cordial, friendly terms with her being respectful of you and your husband, enough for her to have a relationship with you and any future grandkids going forward.\n\nAt worst, it could end up with her returning to her old patterns of emotional abuse, controlling behaviour, meddling in your career, your marriage, and how you choose to raise your kids.

            "I'm also a child of immigrants, and would like to add something. The thing is, most migrants leave their homes behind because they want better for their children. Normally it's because their homeland is economically limited, politically volatile or geopolitically unstable. For them, better means a secure job with a guaranteed high pay. Job security is just social necessity. If you're a doctor, you could be the world's worst doctor but you'll get a job. You could be a fucking terrible lawyer but you'll still make money. A job like in cinematography is different precisely because it relies on several very volatile requirements - you need to be very skilled, highly motivated, and very lucky. Fortunately, you are those things and you are doing very well for yourself. I don't think your parents disowned you because they truly meant it, I think they disowned you to try and control your decision making. That is of course problematic and I'm not denying that. I'd just like to remind you that even that shitty decision was made because they love you, and had your best interests (in their mind) at heart.",

            "Seems a bit ridiculous to tell you not to reconnect with your parents because you only get one mom and dad, but if I were you I\u2019d be cautious going forward. I grew up with a narcissistic, pathological liar of a mother who attempted to manipulate me into hating my father and his side of the family from a young age (they divorced shortly before I was born) and for the longest time I tried to maintain a relationship with her based on the premise of \u201cshe\u2019s your mom, you have to deal with it\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ll tell you this, and please take this advice as much as you can: family or not, bad people are bad people and you do NOT have to deal with toxicity simply because somebody is related to you. Relation is out of your control, how you act isn\u2019t. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t go to say that your parents are entirely \u201cbad\u201d people, but they did a very bad thing to you. And even upon the point of attempted reconciliation, your father is \u201ctoo proud\u201d to admit that he wants you back in his life? Too proud to admit he did the wrong thing to a child of his? Looks and smells like bullshit to me, OP. Protect yourself in this situation. If you must forgive, never forget.\n\nI understand it\u2019s a tough situation and giving advice via Reddit with no personal relationship to you and your family is easy, but speaking from experience; your family isn\u2019t inherently good for you just because you\u2019re related.",
            "I think the problem will be your dad. Your mother will be running interference because\"he's too proud\", soo he won't be expected to put in the effort to contact you, ask for forgiveness, or, even listen to you maybe? Them your mother might end up being a flying monkey for him, and that's not good for anyone, especially you.\nI strongly suggest, to treat them as separate entities. If your mother reached out, meet only her. Don't allow her to talk to you about your father and guilt you into reaching out. He's the one that should do the work. In many traditional families it's the mother who does all the emotional work (and gatekeeps relationships as well), and the father gets used to the wife just cleaning up his relationship messes by running interference and asking others to \"be the bigger person\" \"he's your father\" \"we're a family\".\n\nThis might not be the case, but just beware the possibility and don't fall for it.\n\nEdit: also, read about proper apologies. Someone saying\"I'm sorry\" is not necessarily an apology if it is followed by \"I'm sorry but....\" 'im sorry IF...\" \"I'm sorry that YOUR feelings WERE hurt\". Notice that none of this puts the responsibility on them, but rather on you and your feelings, by something that happened, passively. A proper apology should go, \"I'm sorry that I... \" Admitting responsibility without trying to justify it. Could be something like \"I thought I was doing the right thing, but I now realize that I was very wrong and I should not have done that, I am trying to understand why I did that, because I want to never do that kind of mistake again\".",

Just be cautious. It sounds like you\u2019re doing very well in your field and I am now naturally suspicious of parents who don\u2019t support their child when they are new/struggling but want to know them when they start doing well.

            "I think you should meet them. Your parents sound like the type that want the best for their children, or at least what they think is best. The jobs they had in mind for you are typical for ones that lead to a \"better\" life than what they lived. This rejection of the kid chosing another job, especially one that harbours a realistic potential of not bringing stability, especially not easily, is not uncommon. It is often a panic reaction, with parents fearing their child will fail and suffer. It might not even be that they think one can't have success in that field, but rather be all too aware that it is not as easy as in technical fields (engineering, medicine, even law is a career based on need, while anything entertainment related is a \"nice to have\" basis. This also goes for things like camera and sound crew, but especially for the creative parts.) to be successful and stable. Mind you, even the other careers have potential for failure - there always is. But I think you get what I mean.\n\nSo parents might panic. Their way to deal with it might seem tyrannical, but see it in the way that to them not too long ago, you were a child, a toddler even, that needed guidance. Letting children go on their own is hard, and not always instantaneous. They might not even realise this fully. Sure, kicking you out seems rather irrational if they want to protect you. But this can be compared to grieving. You know, shock, denial, grief, anger, acceptance (not necessarily in that order). They might try to argue, when arguing doesn't work, they might try punishment (\"Go to your room!\"), in the hope the kid might allow them to \"Do what is best for them\". It can take time to realise what they were doing there, and there might be several conflicting motions going on in their heads  - even just simply things like \"Protect the kid and guide it\" versus \"Let it fly and find its way\". Both are really not wrong, I think you'll agree, but they don't always work together. And since  one cannot call either one wrong, the parent find itself in a quandary. Add to this pride, emotion, and immediate reactions, and stupid stuff happens easily. \n\nThat your mother reaches out to you sounds to me like this was the situation. Conflicting options, and how to deal with it. It is highly likely they realised they chose the wrong option, but it took some time. It might seem like they contact you only because you are successful now to make goody goody happy happy. But it also could be, that the message of you being well and successfull eased a long worry from their minds. The worry that their child comes to harm always in their back of their minds. And they might even have realised earlier they were wrong, but that also meant that offering to \"help\" might lead to further rejection as it can come across as a display of supposedly knowing better. But with you doing well on your own, this could have eased that fear, and they dared approaching you again. Sure, help earlier might likely have been appreciated, but unless the realisation came soon enough after the inital fallout to say without too much awkwardness \"Hey sorry about that, please come back home\", the above fear would apply. No longer worrying, no longer fearing, eases the fear induced paralysis in that situation. \n\nGo meet your mother see what she has to say, and the make your decisions, I'd say. \n\n\nAlso, something to consider. You say your father has pride. The question is, what kind of pride. Pride that makes you reluctant to actively admit fault is always tricky, but as long as they can admit it themselves, it is something you can work with. They might not say the words but they will not try and argue their faulty side any longer. Maybe even show their admission of fault it in other ways without words.\n\nIf the pride of your father is merely preventing him from directly admitting he was wrong, then I say really give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThen there's also a thing with pride tied to accomplishments. Parents can be proud of their kids, and usually want to be. The question is in which way? Are they proud of their kids for what the kids accomplished? Basically being proud *for* them. It is also coupled with happiness caused by seeing your kid happy. \n\n\nOr are they proud of their kids *because* of what they accomplished. Being proud *that* their kids are successful, mabye even seeing their kids success as a direct success of their parenting. That last one is a dangerous one, as it often comes with seeing a kids failure as your own failure. How someone deals with that is also relevant, be it with sadness, or anger. Sadness is preferrable, but not ideal either. But anger is particularly bad, as it often ultimately leads to a toxic environment. But I digress. \n\n\nAaanyway. Your father sounds like the type that can admit fault to himself, but has trouble voicing it to others. Not ideal, but still okay. Your parents also sound like they just want you to have a secure life - often called \"what is best in your life\", but that is something based on opinion. Usually it is really just wanting safety for the other, and not yet having figured out that that is actually what the real intent was always (Human minds are beautiful, chaotic, and stupidly irrational things often. It really should come with a manual. \"'Why am I scared that you don't let me help you, and why can't I properly express this to you?' and other emotional messes\" or something like that). And then just panicked when they already saw their kid falling into a canyon before even getting on the train. I think the perfect term is \"Fret\". Give them the chance, meet them, and you can decide on further steps as things become clearer.\n\n(Reposting this comment as one phrasing went against the rules, so I rephrased it. Technically an insult, though not directed at a person but rather used in a description of a bad situation.)",

He doesn't deserve a single shred of pride, and his inability to admit he was wrong shows that he hasn't changed. I hate to say this, but your parents weren't really there when you needed them. It's easy for them to come in now that the dust has settled, but would they have otherwise?\n\nYou may love and want the approval of your parents, but don't turn them into deities. If they were actually apologetic, perhaps you could move on, but if they just want to sweep it under the bridge, fundamentally nothing has changed. Proceed with that in mind.",

            "Hey, I reconnected with my parents after 7 years of NC. We had an excellent, excellent therapist who helped facilitate and helped us process our emotions individually and as a group. At first my parents were REALLY defensive because they couldn't admit they had fucked up, and that was a challenge. We wound up all kind of just... moving past that. They apologized, I apologized (for the hurt they felt in the situation, not because I did anything wrong), but there was no \"closure\" in the sense that we never really went back over what actually happened too much. We just moved forward, with new boundaries, and as equals.\n\nIt was really scary taking the risk to let my parents back into my life after they hurt me so much, and it was very stressful for a while, but it's been one of the best decisions I've ever made. There was definitely a learning curve and I couldn't have handled it without my supportive partner.\n\nI wouldn't have let them back in if they weren't invested in learning how to respect boundaries for the first time ever. I also had to learn to be less reactive. Like I said, learning curve. \n\nHappy to answer any questions if you're interested.",

            "Your parents messed up so they have to be the ones to ask for forgiveness, and that includes your \"too proud\" dad.  Lots of parents are narcissistic control freaks, they can excuse it away by blaming culture, or doing what's good for you, but at the end of the day, they want control and they were willing to stoop so low as to kick out a child out of their home to do that.  That is never ok and you should make it a condition that they fully apologize before restarting any kind of relationship with them.  This apology should be unequivocal, they must BOTH (not just your mom) admit they were wrong, that you knew better than they did on your career decision, that they are sorry, and they will never question your business again.  \n\nYou may think that's harsh because you want to run back to your parents and have a relationship with them again, but guess what is a bigger decision than career for most people?  Marriage!  And you're doing it without their consent or blessing!  What if they don't like your choice of wife?  What if you parents want to dictate how your wedding is handled?  What if they don't like your future child, or where you decide to live?  Just take a look at /r/JUSTNOMIL for how bad parents get while trying to control their adult kids.  You may be in for a world of hurt if you get back under their control without them admitting they're wrong and giving up their plan to dictate your career.  \n\nThat's why they need to fully admit wrong and ask forgiveness.  Otherwise, their control freak tendencies may manifest in the future.  What if they don't like your future child's haircut, or what he does with his career?  Would grandma and grandpa disown their grandkids?  They did it to you, what makes you think they won't try this again?  Make sure they own up to THEIR mistake and make sure its sincere before you decide anything.  Or else it may not just be you who suffers but your wife and kid next time.",

They had a tough time with your brother and then you, and in our worlds, we know they think they failed as parents. It's wrong and problematic and all that but also human. They mess up. Your mother wanting to meet you IS her apology. That's probably all you'll  get for now. They may never come see your movies but they may at some point just start stocking them in their house. Your father may never swallow his pride. But if he is OK with your mom coming to see you, that too is immense. I mean seriously - the number of Hindi/Bollywood movies that are based on this exact same thing are absurd. If you ever want to watch the Bollywood version of your life, start with Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham. \n\nAll this to say, it's complicated from your parents perspective as well. Not to say you owe them forgiveness. If you don't want complicated, or you want an actual apology, that is fair too!! And I support that! But if you do actively choose to go back, know that this is about as big a step as they can make right now. That may evolve and change, but maybe don't go in expecting much more than this. That sets you up for disappointment. It's fine if you don't want to venture into this world at all.

If you don't like what you do, no amount of money will bring you joy and fulfillment.

All the professions your siblings carry a certain status, and imo it is good that they pushed you into engineering (which is also a good profession if you like it, not so if you don't like it). However, your parents shouldn't have kicked you out when you realized it's not what you want. Maybe it was a way of control as some other commentators mentioned, but not with malice. For them going into filmmaking instead of engineering probably was equivalent to going into porn and they wanted to make you \"realize your mistakes before you throw your life down the drain\". Parents from different cultures expect different things from their children, while I don't know enough about your family dynamic, based on the post I think calling it straight out abuse is too much. \n\nWhile I understand your apprehension and you're right to have it, you should at least go see your mom.

I can see a few of my former collegues kicking out their kid for not meeting expectations but not many.  OP I think those high expectations are a big reason why you're at the point you're at.  No you didn't wind up being an engineer but because of your parents you did go to college and find your passion.  Now your parents are realizing their mistake.  You should do what you want to do as far as reconciling (just like you did what you wanted with your life and career).  Personally if they're big enough to apologize I would meet with them.  They sound like they're ready to accept you as an adult and not look at you only as their kid that didn't meet their expectations.  I wish you luck whatever you decide.  Plllease give us a follow up if you feel like it.",

You're going to be a PROFESSIONAL and make real money!\" In their shoes, it's real easy to understand their rationale. Here you have the opportunities they never did, and you are \"squandering\" them on silly pursuits and Hollywood dreams. That the American Dream very specifically includes \"the pursuit of happiness\", well that can wait until after you have a career and a big house for them to visit.\n\nKeep in mind even if your career takes off and you GET the big house for them to visit, it still won't be a \"real job\" like your siblings have.

            "I too would be inclined to see what they have to say. \n\nMy dad is also a proud man, and he doesn't always talk about things or express everything even when he wants to do so. Sometimes it takes him a little extra time to be able to verbalize his thoughts and feelings, but I've always personally felt that that trait makes the things he does express mean more. That being said, maybe your dad will have something to say if you meet up with your parents. \n\nMy dad has softened as he's gotten older (my parents are currently in their 50s), and his outlook on many things has changed as a result. He isn't necessarily any more communicative, but he shows more in his actions than he did when I was a kid. Perhaps your parents have softened as time has gone by, and they've realized they want to be in your life in the future, especially since you're getting married. \n\nI agree with the other posters in that the worst case scenario is that you end up in the situation you were already in, and you already know how to handle that. Best case scenario is you're able to have your parents in your life again. I don't personally think you have anything to lose in seeing them again. \n\nRegardless of what happens, I'm really proud of you for going after the career that felt right to you, even in spite of not having the approval of everyone around you. It's really hard to lose any of your support system, and it sounds like you dealt with it beautifully. What you've accomplished is amazing, and you should be incredibly proud of yourself, regardless of how your parents ultimately feel about your cinematography. \n\nCongratulations, on your career and in your starting a family of your own with your partner!",

I knew they wouldn't agree with it and that it would be a really shitty experience for everyone.  over time I harbored resentment towards them that I couldn't be who I am around them.\n\n One day, I was talking to my dad and he said something homophobic. I honestly dont remember what exactly he said, but that was the last straw for me. I just told him that I was gay and that if he couldn't respect me for who I was then I wouldn't be able to find ot in myself to respect him. \n\nAnd if you knew my dad, he is a man of honor who always tries to conduct himself in a way that aligns with his own morals and ethics (even if I dont agree with them) and so this was a brutal stab back at him. \n\nThis is one of the biggest regrets of my life. \n\nI wish I could have shown him kindness and respect. Finding out your son is gay as a devout catholic father is not an easy transition and instead of handling that situation with care and courtesy, I lashed out. I basically told him the same thing that I had heard from the church my entire life: if you dont do x, then I dont love you. I wish I had been strong enough to go into that situation with love and understanding of my dads situation. \n\nI'm not saying my dad was right and I was wrong. I think we were both in the wrong, but I just wish I handled that better and I would like to encourage you to take whatever time you need to make sure you fully understand your emotions before going into the situation. Maybe talk to a therapist beforehand. A lot of people are saying to go and hear what your mom has to say, but I think this situation requires a little more planning and preparation than that. \n\nWhat would the relationship be like between you and your parents after this? If they apologize? If they dont apologize?\n\nDo you want a relationship with them?\n\nWhat kind of people are they?\n\nDo you want them in your future kids' lives? \n\nSince then my relationship with both my parents have gotten much stronger. I dont really talk about my sexuality with my dad, but he knows it and knows there is nothing he can do to change. I would like him to become more comfortable with it eventually, but he has shown his support and love for me in countless other ways. So maybe you wont get the verbal apology from your dad that you want, but maybe he'll offer to come help fix your house or car, or however your father shows love. \n\nHope this all works out and everyone ends up in a happier place.",

You grieved. You were angry. But also our time with them is limited. My only advice is do what you will regret the least, looking back.  \n\n\nThat may include giving them a piece of your mind.  \n\n\nAlso, a couple joint sessions with a therapist as a mediator is quite useful in these situations.

When I told my parents I wanted to be a musician, they paid for my lessons and for my music degree, and when I wanted to go back to school for audio engineering they took money out of their retirement fund so I could afford tuition and equipment.

I met with my mom years later and I\u2019m so happy I did. We were able to build a relationship again and I feel like I have my mom back. She admitted to really messing up and living with the regret. I appreciated that and forgave her. I think your instinct is right... meet up with her. It\u2019s a good first step. And don\u2019t feel bad if it takes time to forgive! That\u2019s only natural.

And just like you are now, I'm on the fence of meeting her and giving her a chance to show shes changed. \n\nMy advice would be to meet her. Give her the chance. We only get one set of biological parents and I think it a shame to not at least try to create a bond with them in some way because one day you'll never have the chance.

I've been no contact for several years, and my parents reached out to try to establish some contact again recently. \n\nI've decided to take things slow. I love my parents and would like to enjoy a relationship with them. Many of the things i love about me, i owe to them. At the same time, the generational and ideological divide is real. I dont expect our long distance overtures are going to bridge that gap. It will take work and effort from both parties. Right now, the desire to connect is flickering, we will see if it grows and if my family is willing to do the work and if i am willing to do the work to build that bridge.\n\nI've had a couple conversations with my mom, and i'm going to see what happens moving forward, but keeping my expectations low, and managing the expectations of my parents has been wise. \n\nIn my case, my mom still is very much in her narratives about the world and i dont really hold hope she will ever see me as \"acceptable\" really, but its something. If nothing else, i know their narratives arent able to erase their familial connection, and that is validating. It helps. \n\nMy advice, such as it is: keep your expectations low. Dont focus on your feelings when you meet, you'll be in a better place to deal with them later. While together, show curiosity about her life and you family. If nothing else it will show them you still care. You've got a right to feel guarded and  you dont need to feel forced by them. Dont accept their attempts at leverage, but recognize they're coming from a place of compassion. When they see that you understand them, and love them but are not controlled by them, and will be an individual adult human being, just like they are, you will enter a new chapter in that relationship. I'm curious what yours may look like. Parents transitioning to peers takes time.",

I would say there wasn\u2019t a day they didn\u2019t regret kicking you out.\n\nI don\u2019t know about your parents but mine are also immigrants. It wasn\u2019t until recently I came to understand how hard it was for them to get us to this point.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s my opinion as I see it, family is important and you don\u2019t want to leave anything until it\u2019s too late. ie, God forbids, what if the last thing you spoke to them was when you got kicked out ? I\u2019m sure that might not be the sort of memory you want to have.\n\nTake this as an opportunity, see how it goes, like some of the comments say, sus it out as you\u2019re in the driver seat. Also your brother is a freaking G.\n\nAll the best my dude.",
            "Meet your parents.  I had something similar but different happen to me. My Dad has been gone for 10 years now.  I never regret reconciling with them.  Today to see my mom with my kids, it's magic.  If there were a bridge before you, allow these past issues to flow under it.  Trust me.",
            "Never regret what you have done in life, only regret the things you haven't done.\nTalk to her and tell her you love her.\nThere's a lot of things I wish I would have said to my mom and now I can't.",
            "I'm in a similar situation, because I didn't become what my parents wanted. they have yet to talk to me though. I know they have hurt you, but at the end of the day they are your parents. At least hear them out. Then decide from there. Sorry you had to to go through this. I know the pain of being the black sheep of the family. Any benefit though from the experience however, I will be better for my children and will accept what they want to do, so long as it makes them happy. My mother is Korean. I think sometimes the cultural difference causes different expectations. My mother kicked me out originally because she found out I had a tattoo- which was usually associated with criminals in korea back then. In the US it is fairly common. Good luck to you \u2764",
            "It well cost you nothing but your time to listen.\nThe worst case is, you go and decide nothing has changed and to remain where you are now.",
            "I think a lot of people might say don't go, but I really think you should. Family drama happens, and it's not cool that they kicked you out. However they probably sacrificed a lot to move to America so their kids could have a better life. I think in the end they just didn't want you to end up like them, and to be fair film making is not super stable. At least go talk to her and see what she has to say.",
            "I\u2019m not going to read the comments but you should forgive your parents for the really bad parental choices they made. Trust may take awhile but being in their lives again would be good for all.",
            "While its certainly easy to hold your parents to a higher standard and expect the best to them, we have to remember that they are still human and therefore, will make mistakes in their lives. They also grew up in a different time and place from you so their values are vastly different.  I would absolutely encourage you to go see your mom and give her a chance to apologize.  You never know how long they have and you dont want to miss the chance.\n\n I lost my father when I was 29 and it was very quick. He was a normal, healthy person and then cancer hit and 14 weeks later he was gone. In his final days, he was in a tremendous amount of pain and refusing pain killers which lead to him lashing out at me. There were days I left furious. The last day, he had been mean and instead of getting mad, I told him I loved him and kissed his bald head. I'm thankful it ended on a good note.",
            "Congratulations on the choices you made. You stuck to it, and because of your perseverance, dedication, talent and grit, you are now a successful and financially independent cinematographer. Well done mate. As for your situation, I would go and meet my mom and dad. They had their concerns but you have proven them wrong. Be the bigger man and reconcile with them. Life is too short my friend. And we do not what's around the corner so to speak. One day our parents are still here, then the next time, they're gone. Build that \"bridge\" and start making memories (and videos) with and of your parents and family. Goodluck.",
            "This is a hard one but I'm gonna go with a good old classic. They are gonna die one day better make the best of it now. All the emotions you mentioned are things you will have to work on at some point (cuz that shit tears at  you). Sounds like you have an opportunity to work on it now but with one of your parents. I'm not saying that everything is fine now that she is trying to reconnect but you taking a long, hard look at your feelings and disappointment could allow you to put it to bed. Talking with or to your mother could help getting some kind of closure. \nIf you do it, do it for you",
            "Are you (kind of) me? \n\nMy elder sis is a doctor, younger is an Engineer and I am (kind of) a lawyer. We\u2019re AFRICAN as well. When I chose to not practice law my dad went batshit crazy for a while. And I was blackmailed into going to grad school law ... or else; they would have kicked me out. I was staying with them at the time.\n\nI then moved in with my then boyfriend but still felt the pressure from a distance. I caved in. \n\nAnd I promised myself that was the last time I would do something I had been forced into.\n\nNow, I started my own startup in the tech space. They don\u2019t understand what the hell I do. But then started becoming supportive when I landed gigs in London, Nairobi, Berlin, etc. They just wanted to know that I wasn\u2019t gonna throw my life and brilliance away. That I knew what I was doing and was going to be just fine. It was fear more than anything. Me being okay made them relax. \n\nI didn\u2019t like them for a long time. But I still loved them. I went into depression and desperation. But I still loved them. I wouldn\u2019t have survived it without my now boyfriend who supports me emotionally and $$ when I\u2019m down (startup life)\n\nFor a lot of us Africans, \u2018fancy\u2019 careers are more for your parents than for you. They wanted what they thought was best for you. And we know how the pride thing goes esp with Nigerian dads (and Kenyans too!)\n\nBe gracious. They love you, even if they weren\u2019t too good at it. If you can forgive, please do. Go get your family back. You mum probably misses the hell out of you.",
            "I know it is kind of cheesy but when my grandma died, my mom (her daughter) told me that the only regret she had was to not enjoy my grandma enough. I always think of that when there is a big fight with my parents/siblings/family in general.\nI think you should consider that and meet her. Despite everything, they are still your mom and dad ans just wants what is best for you.",
            "That really sucks, being essentially disowned for being a creative is so heartbreaking. On the plus side, if you decide to film yourself flipping the bird in their general direction, it'll probably look stunning.",
            "I agree with you, I would see her. People do stupid shit sometimes, overstep boundaries, act like utter assholes...but they did it because they have tons of cultural pressure and expectations and wanted \u201cwhat they thought was best\u201d for you. We have to let people change if we want change. You don\u2019t even have to think about what comes after that now. \n\nAnd you have all the power in the situation. Remember that when you feel nervous. Let us know what happens.",
            "The fact your parents reached out says alot. I say you hear them out and try not to be too bitter. Also try to understand parents just want what is best for their kids and some parents are more controlling than others and when you are under their roof only can see their method as the best. But it sounds like you forged a path and made something when they were not exactly the most supportive. Try not to hold that against them and be open to the idea of slowly reconciliation.",
            "OP, please remember the fear that your parents live with. They made a huge huge sacrifice leaving their home particularly so that you could get better opportunities. They don't know of careers outside of typical \"successful\" careers; I bet they would have been upset if you studied sociology. So for them, it is almost like you threw away a diamond. I understand that you do have a real job but they don't. Keep this in mind when you do talk with them.",
            "The brother that took you in got lucky and loved being a lawyer I bet and he sees the value in doing something you love. Other two siblings probably don't care much for their jobs and unconsciously don't believe that jobs can be something you like. \n\nI don't have any solution for you but I feel like what you're feeling will guide you best in this situation. If you want your parent back in your life go for it. If you hold too much of a grudge keep them at a distance like they did you. \n\nI'd personally want to reconnect, to a point. Holding a grudge would only make me feel worse when I could just let it go.",
            "Yes, yes, yes, absolutely meet with your mother. She is still your mother, and the only one you will ever have. You do not want to grow old with bitterness in your family.\n\nYes, you have every right to be hurt by what they did. You have every right to be hurt by the continued attitude of your parents and two of your siblings. Yes, you have the right to your own happiness. And yes, the best revenge is a life well lived.\n\nIn a perfect world with perfect people this should not happen. The facts are, that this is not a perfect world, and there are no perfect people. Your parents made a huge mistake, however, based on their culture, that is what they knew about how to act. It doesn't make it right, but it does explain their actions.\n\nMeet with your Mother, listen to what she has to say, and if at all possible, forgive her for what she has done. This would be a huge step to repairing the damage to your family, that they caused. You are on the path to a good career, you are getting married soon. Reuniting with your family, will be a blessing for the future of all of you. \n\nIf you have children, they will be blessed, if they have loving grandparents and loving Aunts and Uncles. \n\nYou have nothing to lose by meeting with your Mother, and everything to gain.",
            "Another redditor above was very harsh. He wrote ,\" don' t let your mum be' the mouthpiece of your father\".\nI live in a culture where women are expected to take care of emotional needs of their families, to not mention the daily cores.  So, when you look at our role in the family, you can never tell if we are hostages or the masters of our homes. If you think she is used by your father this is a very wrong way to restart your relationship. It is a clear he don t want to discuss his past decisions. I think you have in any way to meet your mum. We makes big mistakes but we can learn from them.",
            "I understand it's a pain but honestly just be proud, wear the axcomplishment on your sleeve but don't rub it in, that is your ego talking, instead reconnect with your family, watch them change their minds and grow as people as they realize how happy you are doing what you are doing, if they don't grow from it then don't keep in contact with them.\nTrust me when I say that I know what you feel but rubbing it in their face or continuing to resent them will only cause you further pain, embrace and be open to them and your relationship will be stronger than ever. Good luck :)",
            "Forgive them why miss out on your inheritance.",
            "Meet with her. If she\u2019s ready to apologize, accept it gracefully. Catch up. Let her know your happy to forgive your father, too, if he\u2019s able to bring himself to ask. Family is too important to let it slip away over pride. \n\nAnd honestly, you shouldn\u2019t be al that smug. You wouldn\u2019t have made it anyway if your brother hadn\u2019t subsidized you for a significant amount of time. You owe a big piece of your current success to him. Reconciling with his mom and dad is one way you can pay some of that back.",
            "Forgive. No matter what happens, they're still your parents. I just hope you'll be able to do it before they die because some live with this regret and I'll pray it won't happen to you.\n\nCongratulations on your beginning of your career. It's not easy but you seem to make things work.",
            "One thing about African parents like yours is they genuinely believe that your career was a reckless choice guaranteed to give you a bad life. They probably took it as a personal insult that they immigrated to give you a better life just for you to actively pursue a worse life.\n\nNow they have to admit they are wrong, which is very hard for African parents to do since their parents almost never did this for them. So they put off the conversation in order to work up the humility to do so. Now 1 is ready. I'm not saying they're wrong I'm just saying they're normal and hoping you approach this understanding their perspective.",
            "You only have one set of parents. You don\u2019t have to get along, but don\u2019t forget each other too. Otherwise you may regret it later in life.",
            "You should accept the apology from then but don't give up your dreams. Those expectations of engineering for you are their expectations. Not yours. I recently went through that breakthrough. Life is really short dude. Do what you want. Go places you want to go and do things you want to do. Money doesn't actually matter very much. You don't have a connection to every dollar you make, and your actions don't reflect on anyone but yourself. Live the life that you want to live and only that life. We all get one life. Live the one that you want to. If they can't accept that, then it's their issue and not yours. It sounds like you're very passionate about filmmaking and you'd be dumb not to follow that. Even if you fail, you probably did a lot of really cool stuff along the way. As well as meeting some really cool people who will impact you for the rest of your life. If you spend your whole life trying to be as successful as other people, you're going to fail. But the conversations and experiences you have along the way are really the part of life that's even worth living in the first place.",
            "Congrats man! Nothing better than proving yourself in a difficult, competitive field. \n\nThis is an age-old tale - parents spend 18 years busting their ass to ensure you have a better life than they did, you decide to forgo their advice and live your life how you want to live it (good on you!) and they react by any means necessary to keep you \"safe and happy\" (their definition of course). \n\nUltimately, it's a shitty way to parent, but it's also coming from a place of love, as twisted as it is. The good news is that you've got some leverage here. At the very least, they need to accept it's your life to live, and while they are entitled to their opinion, you really don't give a shit. If this is just some scheme to make you feel like the bad child who spurns his parents, I would be back on the no contact plan",
            "Filmmaking isn't a wise career choice *generally speaking* and I understand where your parents are coming from, having left a third world country to offer you a better life here. You may not understand them now, but when you forgo your own enjoyment in this harsh ride called \"life under capitalism\" and save every dime for your kids college and only operate with what your culture and experience tells you, and you see your kids blowing your money on something your life experience has told you may not work well, you'll understand them. They aren't perfect. They didn't know you'd be the outlier that lives well in this career. Good for you for succeeding. But they were understandably upset. Go in ready to forgive. You'll make similar mistakes with your own children, and would want their forgiveness as well.",
            "I think this sub is very, very quick to jump to \u201ccut these people out of your life forever! They were wrong!\u201d And your parents were wrong. But it\u2019s OK to talk to your mom and open up the possibility of them someday finding a way to make it up to you. It\u2019s ok to want to forgive your parents and to still love them even after they do bad things. \n\nIt\u2019s extra-tricky for immigrant parents who have such high educational/career wishes for their children to reckon with the idea of a creative. You chose your path and you\u2019ve made a life of it - congratulations. Seriously. You have nothing to prove to them. But it\u2019s OK to give them a chance to admit they were wrong (and only rub it in their faces just a tiiiiny little bit).",
            "I really need more information for perspective please.  I just feel that your story about your parents lacks some perspective.\n\n1.  You say you are 26 and a few years ago, you were kicked out.  Now a few years could be 2-4 years, meaning they kicked you out when you were 22-24 years old.  How old were you when they kicked you out?\n\n2.  Did they give you notice?  Were you kicked out immediately, or did they give you a timeframe?  This makes a big difference.\n\n3.  Did they financially support your education?  Did you complete your degree?  Do you have any student loans or do they have any loans for money they borrowed for your education.  If they spent several thousand or tens of thousands of dollars on your education and you did not complete it, that is very relevant.\n\n4.  How are you REALLY doing financially?  Do you have your own place, own car, and an emergency fund.  How much debt do you have? i.e. student loans, credit cars, car loans.\n\nI just don't want to make a judgement or give advice until I have a balanced perspective.",
            "Ignore the smugness. Your pride will only be your downfall. As for the anger. You may still be angry but there time on earth is running out. You really dont want regrets like missing out on memories with them. They will eat you up.",
            "You're only 26, you gotta let the anger and resentment go.  You already won by showing them you were right you will be just fine if you forgive.  In a culture such as the one your parents are from where it is the norm to disown over career choices, then it is a huge deal for your mom to reach out like that.  Everyone makes mistakes and she is trying to amend for hers I think she deserves at least a meeting.  If she tries to make you feel bad for your choices then bounce the fuck out but at least see what she has to say.",
            "Just let it be, see your family and accept Mom\u2019s apology. Its worth getting to have that time than to regret it later. Trust me.",
            "I think you should give her a chance. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve both been holding back guilt since that happened. I can only imagine they have suffered enough as Is. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been hard for you, but that just shows the effort you can put in for yourself. You didn\u2019t need them to be successful. So be your own man if they question your profession. You\u2019re a grown ass man that has proven he can be what he wants. You seem confident, so show your mom who you are and don\u2019t hold anything back. Show her why they should be proud of what you\u2019ve become! Best of luck, I hope you give them a chance!",

I got to the grave site before the funeral procession so that I could go over the event proceedings with the conducting officials. They were very nice and understanding of me wanting to play. They told me what my cue would be to begin playing, I took my place about 10 feet behind the grave (everyone would be gathered in front of the grave), and waited for the procession to arrive.\n\nI was very nervous, but I knew that I wanted to follow through with this no matter how it went. Once everyone was there and the casket was set in place, a pastor stood before the crowd and offered some final words while the two air force representatives stood on either side of the casket. After the pastor was done speaking, the representatives saluted and I knew it was time to begin.\n\nI took a deep breath, brought my horn up to my lips, closed my eyes and began to play, starting on a D, as some people suggested (it is a lower note, and is easier to play, and no one knows the difference).\n\nWell reddit, it was perfect. I couldn't be more happy that I was able to honor my grandfather as he asked me to before his passing.\n\nI just wanted to thank everyone for the kind words and suggestions. They were a great encouragement and I don't know if I would have ended up doing it if it wasn't for everyone here.\n   \n**tl;dr**: I did it! It was perfect and I will forever remember performing this honor for my grandfather just like he wanted.\n\n**edit:** Wow thank you kind guilder! That's a first for me.",

It's not a solo voice, at all.  But, I have always kept a policy, that I sing, when asked, at weddings or funerals.  You can't refuse those requests - whether joyful or sad, they are *irreplaceable*.  So far, one wedding, three funerals.

We both played taps for Memorial Day, vets funerals, etc. over the years and it was something we shared.  Only seemed right to honor him when it was time. Everything went fine until the high note, which I of course cracked. I wanted to cry but could only laugh. He would've thought it was hilarious.

            "Oh wow.  I wish I'd seen your original post, I would have offered all the encouragement in the world.  But it sounds like you did fantastic without it!\n\nYears ago (Jesus, has it really been 8 years?) I delivered the eulogy at my sister's funeral.  I was a complete emotional shit show the entire week leading up to the service, and I have had many a shit show moment since the service (truth be known the shit show moments still come every now and again).  But for that hour I went to a mental place that allowed me to maintain enough mental clarity that I could give her the sendoff she deserved.  It was the most important thing I've ever done, and I had to find some kind of emotional center or I would have fucked it up by blubbering through the whole thing.  No way.  People who were there still talk about it to this day, how funny and warm and sentimental and irreverent and charming my eulogy was.  I don't say that out of arrogance, I say it out of sheer disbelief given the debilitating severity of the shock and grief I was suffering at that time. That anything coherent came out that was miraculous.  And I am honored I was able to do her memory some sort of justice.  It was my duty, my final gift to her.\n\nGood god, I don't mean to hijack your thread.  I guess my point is this - in the future when you are in doubt, when you aren't quite sure you have what it takes to accomplish whatever task you have ahead of you, remember that you pulled your shit together in your darkest moment, when it would have been perfectly understandable to melt down.  But you didn't.  You handled that shit like a boss, just like you're going to handle the next thing like a boss.  Because that's what you do!",

He kept making my depression about him, not really listening to me or empathizing with my feelings. I just got a little too overwhelmed by him. He started to blame me for my feelings \"affecting\" him so negatively. He was upset that my depression was making *him* bummed out. I started going in to a downward spiral of depression. \n\nThe long story short is that we broke up about a month ago. It started off as a \"break\" so I could just deal with it on my own without \"affecting\" him, but now it is permanent. \n\nAnyways... About two days after the break started, I immediately started noticing I wasn't feeling as depressed anymore. I know the depression will always come back in swings, but at least I don't have to deal with him digging in the way he was. He's upset that we won't be getting back together but I feel infinitely less stressed.\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend was digging in and making my depression about him.

Going forward I think it would be a good thing to remember that balancing a relationship with your mental health is going to be tricky at times, as you\u2019ve said in previous comments that you were diagnosed years ago meaning you were depressed before your ex. Relationships are a new challenge when dealing with depression but one I want you to know that when met with great persistence and understanding from both sides is something that can work. My greatest piece of advice for when the time comes is to know yourself, know your limits and remember that your life isn\u2019t just your life anymore, you\u2019re sharing it with someone else so you must take their thoughts and feelings into consideration and yes, that means sometimes they come before your depressive episodes.\n\nSource: have experienced a lot of anxiety/depression and just want to save you some struggle.

            "My stomach knotted up reading this. My ex was notorious for pushing me further down by  making me feel guilty about something I couldn\u2019t help. He would get all dramatic and it would make my head spin. Small spat\u2019s or down feeling days would led to back and forth bs about how it\u2019s all about him. My heart would race, head throb. I would be so confused that I didn\u2019t even trust my own feelings. It was awful. I would tell him to please just try to be supportive and not think it\u2019s him, that I couldn\u2019t cope with trying to console him, to no avail at that, over nonexistent issues while dealing with my own stuff.  I look back and so regret the years I was with him. \n\nWe broke up once and I told him I could no longer deal with the above things. He agreed to change it. However, it didn\u2019t change it only manifested differently. Still miserable. I finally just stopped caring. I ran out of fucks to give. He would go as far as telling me everyone is better off without him and he\u2019s good for nobody. He would make me think he\u2019s going to kill himself. He never said it directly but just hint around. He would carry on for days and I remember how angry I got when someone would call or come over and he snaps back to normal. \n\nHe tried the whole \u2018I\u2019m gonna off myself\u2019 shit when we split. I said that I\u2019d call the police and his parents and hung up. He frantically called back to stop me. Lol. ",

I never gave myself time to heal from being hurt, and for the last few months of our relationship I was incredibly depressed because he wanted to be dating someone that wasn\u2019t me anymore. I wanted to tear myself apart to be a new person for him, but everything fell short. When I broke up with him for good I was so much happier. My suicidal thoughts basically evaporated and I could breathe. My only actual advice would be to make sure you don\u2019t let the way he treated you color your other relationships. It\u2019s been over a year and I still expect my SO to treat me like my ex did and I still tend to put my depression in a box so he doesn\u2019t have to see it. ",

The way he blamed you for your depression was fucked up. If you don't have a therapist, I recommend seeing one if you are able. Therapy helped me through some pretty low times in my life, and even though I was ashamed of being in therapy in my youth, taking a self care step like that now just makes me feel more empowered.\n\nGood luck OP!",

            "So, here's something crazy. I didn't see you first post, but I see this now. So I'll tell you a story that might have made more sense in your first one. \n\nI had a big group of friends in college. We were like, you normal outcast group. We weren't partiers, we weren't this or that. We just were. And we were friends. \n\nTwo of my friends ended up moving in together for our final year of college. One was my old roommate, who I knew had a handful of issues. Agoraphobia and anxiety/depression being the main issue. The friend who she moved in with had always seemed like a normal, typical friendly guy. He was getting into med school. He was smart. He was friendly and so easy to talk to. I loved him, and still do to this day. \n\nBut when they moved in together. Oh god. I couldn't spend any time with them. Both of them would enter my living space and just suck the life out of everything. My old roommate would hear someone say something positive, and she'd talk about her negatives. My old bubbly med friend would do an exaggerated sigh and talk about how even though he's been accepted to these med schools, he'd obviously never make it and was never going to be smart enough. It was SO EXHAUSTING. I even felt awful after hanging out with them, but it took me a while to realize why. \n\nSo I took a break from them during that time. We still talk to this day, and I honestly love them so much, but you never realize how much the people you're living with bring you down sometimes. Some people just end up feeding off of each other's emotions. Be they negative or positive. You did a good thing by removing him from your life. Never doubt that. \n\nTo be the best you, you must believe that a better you exists. You can't do that with someone breathing down negativity on your neck all day. ",
            "My husband used to tell me things like \"You're not depressed, you're just lazy\" and \"You were never in any REAL pain\" and \"I don't feel like dealing with your stupid problem (depression) right now\" and \"you're such a pain in the ass\" to the extent that I would have to find somewhere in the house to hide from him when I had to cry (which was every single day) because if he saw me in tears he'd make things worse. I was in such bad shape, hurting terribly, and just dying for any small words of reassurance or physical gesture to show that he cared about me. He ended up dying fourteen months ago from an aggressive incurable cancer and he continued to invalidate and minimize my feelings until the day he died. I'm still struggling with depression but it's gotten so much better since I don't have him constantly throwing salt on my wounds. ",
            "I\u2019ve been in the same situation. It got to the point where I could not stand him touching me during panic attacks, it would literally make my skin crawl. A year later, I was in a better relationship and had a panic attack and all I wanted was for my new bf to hold me. Having his arms around me while he just repeated \u201cyou\u2019re okay, you\u2019re safe\u201d felt entirely different than panic attacks with my ex. I\u2019m glad you were able to find your way out or a bad situation and promise that the next time you\u2019re ready to date, you\u2019ll be more able to find someone with qualities that only lift you up!

            "Wow this post struck me right in the soul. After reading the first post and coming back to read this one, I feel less bad. Im the same age and my boyfriend of 3 years is 29 as well. I was shocked to read of his remarks and it made me hurt for you. It took more than a year into our relationship for him to consider that depression isn't all in my head, and all I have to do is flick the thoughts switch. To me him just considering it in our conversation was a success.\n\nBut even today, and after that small success which only lasted about a week, he nags and groans that I'm not constantly chipper, or that I'm just doing this on purpose, because I'm complacent and I stay in my sad feelings instead of getting up to workout or do something else he randomly suggests. \n\nAnd I crumbled when I read your comment about resentment. I've been trying to Google this to figure it out. I dont know how not to resent him for telling me terrible things when he is sick of my depression being in the same house as him. He resents me too and I cant Google how to fix that.\n\nI guess I'm just saying thanks for the read and even though I cant say I can consider leaving the relationship right now.... you give me hope.  \n\nIt is so great that you got away from that situation and I am so glad you are moving on contentedly with your life.

            "Congrats on escaping from hell!\n\nCan confirm that the majority of people's stress and depression is the shitty people that they are living with.\nI noticed this when I moved out of home away from my toxic as fuck mother,  (when I was about 20) who continuously put me down,and then later from my equally toxic partner of 20 years, who was also a nasty, high lvl narciscist.\n\nWhen I decided to block both from my life, amazingly, the majority of my crippling depression went away.\nWhile it's still there a bit, I am no longer fed upon by vultures such as those. I call such people energetic vampires, because they love to feed on others' misery. If they can't find some, they create it.\n\nYou dodged no so much a bullet...but a cannonball, lol! Well done!\n\nNow you have a real chance of healing, and thriving!\n\n I would reccomend looking up narciscist traits, just so you know what to look out for next time. All narcs follow the EXACT same script and behaviour. It's uncanny! Once you know their tricks, you become immune to their bullshit.\n\nAgain,congrats, and I wish you every strength and happiness! :) ",
            "I'm so sorry you went through this. It does sound like it is for the better though for probably both of you. Similar thing happened to me recently. A few months back I started really struggling with anxiety. After my first panic attack, my boyfriend was so supportive, and then just a few short hours later he was telling me he hadn't been feeling supported enough, plus a lot of other things I needed to work on. Basically I spent the next two months trying to support and love him more, while I got no love or support for my anxiety, which just made me more anxious. A few weeks ago he actually broke up with me (which still angers me after everything I tried to do) but I do feel much less anxious despite the fact that I still miss him immensely. I am not entirely sure what happened as up to that point, he had always been so loving and supportive and it just seemed to flip like a switch. I just keep reminding myself that it is for the better, at least for now, and I need to take time to work on myself. Remember that everyone deserves someone who will be there for them through any and all struggles they may go through and will be willing to work through it with them. And take time to yourself for a while and show yourself some self-love because it is much deserved. ",

He told me to go back on my meds. \n\nI told him I\u2019m not medicating myself into a relationship, so if we can\u2019t make it work now, then it won\u2019t.\n\nWe got divorced a year or two later. \nStill not on meds.

            "Definitely better you got away and am glad you feel better. I also hope your ex reaches out and gets some help of his own as I think he was trying to emotional use you in a way to cover his own problems. I don't think he intended to do so or for it to negatively affect you, but without good self reflection skills these things can happen easily.\n\nEdit: I don't want this to be taken as me suggesting that you should go and teach him those skills. Never do that as it's his own personal problem, but I just didn't see anyone else in this thread try to understand his behavior. Instead everyone was condemning it when in reality I think negative behaviors leave great room for growth when self realized.",
            "Good for you on that decision. I can so relate. It's draining to be in a relationship where the other person is so self-absorbed that they always want to steer the focus on them. It's what I call: *reverse narcissism.* It's the kind of narcissism where they aren't trying to prove how awesome they are but more about how much their life sucks in comparison to you. Always trying to steer the conversation back to how it affects them. Making it clear that their problems are far more significant than yours. When you finally get to express how you feel, they acknowledge it for just long enough to suit their purpose (keeping you there) and then it's back to the old \"what about me\" focus... I wish that I had as much bravery as you right now.",
            "So to start well done on getting away from unneeded toxicity. Had you still been in the situation I would have been yelling at my phone/computer for you to run not walk to some support structure whether that was a family member or friend(S). Been down the depression road before and it's reared it's ugly head every so often and I take steps to minimize the effects so it doesn't hit as hard as it has. Usually comfort in music or hobbies.\n\nIn the future if you find another significant other then slowly start to discuss what you have dealt with and what you may deal with so that in time they can be your support structure. Like giving you your space or being there with pizza and cheesy movies. ",

Except she called it off without doing a break first. As someone who experiences bouts of depression throughout my life, I kicked myself after realizing what I was doing to her months after the break up, I should have known better. But during that period, all I thought was that I should help her get happy as best as I can, while she kept getting distant. I attributed that to being my fault, when in actuality it was her depression, and all she needed was space to herself so that she could get through it. But my constant pressuring and presence kept making it worse, and helped no one.\n\nI'm sorry that it ended between you two, OP, but it's probably for the best, as I've learned. And I hope he learned too on how to actually deal with someone undergoing depression, let alone a significant other because it's really hard.

After I emailed the software company and they refused to refund it, I emailed my boss letting him know that, and that's when he dropped the reimbursement line. I still don't know exactly what type of reimbursement he was looking for, but I'm fairly certain now that what he meant was that he'd have to get it from the budget of the small team I work in and he runs, which would be a waste of money. He also CC'd our office assistant and told her to help me figure this out.\n\n\nA few hours later, she emailed back saying she'd talked to the software company on the phone and they stuck to their guns and offered a credit, and that was the best/only option. After seeing all the comments in the original thread, I gave it another shot and called the company. I basically reiterated that we've been loyal customers and would like to continue, but that wouldn't be possible if we weren't refunded. I escalated to a manager, who was more than understanding and got the refund processed!\n\n\nI then emailed only my boss (didn't wanna make the assistant feel like I did something she couldn't) saying the refund was being processed and sent him a receipt. His exact response was \"Good job /u/saltymuffaca. Stuff happens, the key is that you were adamant about it and got it fixed.\" Luckily, my boss thinks I handled the situation well, and all is well!\n\n\ntl;dr - happy update, I escalated the situation, got the refund when others couldn't, and my boss thinks I handled everything well",

This placates the admin and reinforces their role in the team, and shows your maturity to your boss, as he can see the CC'd parties. After all, the admin emailed YOU to tell you they hit a brick wall, not the boss (and wisely so), thereby exhibiting good interoffice diplomacy.  \n  \nWhat you did could be seen as upstaging to both parties, so try to exercise better judgment towards your team in the future.  There is no love for a team member who doesn't (exernally, at least) acknowledge combined effort (even if, and *especially*, \"when\", others' efforts are/were fruitless).
