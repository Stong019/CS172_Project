This issue is such a non-issue that I can't believe how seriously you all took me. All the tips, caution, the encouragement just reminded me how wonderful everyone here can be.\n\n\nThanks to you guys and the post I made, I was reminded of all the wonderful qualities and reasons I fell in love with my boyfriend and I decided to send him some pictures. It took awhile to find one I felt comfortable with, but I did find one! I know some people think I shouldn't, but I did include my face in it because I feel like it helped show how much I trust Ben and how much I love him.\n\n\nI waited until the late evening when he told me how he was getting ready for head off to bed when I messaged him with a picture and then sent \"More surprises when you get back ;)\" and I'll admit, I got a little panicky. After a few minutes, Ben sent a message back with \"Oooh very sexy! <3\" and pretty much that was that (Outside of our usual goodnights and I love yous).\n\n\nI'll admit it, reddit, I didn't know how to take his message back on account of having never sent a photo like this before. Was he being nice? Was this a typical response which was good? Should he have said more? Should I have said more? I didn't know how to feel other than a little disappointed, especially with how long it took me to take the photo. Alongside this, Ben sent me a message the next day telling me about how busy he'll be and then never responded back. I got upset and started feeling like I made a mistake. I spent my day off work with a mix of disappointment, regret and panic, a panic that I had made a huge mistake.\n\n\nWell, that afternoon I got a knock at my door and who was there? Ben. That's who was at my door. Ben and a bunch of flowers. I wasn't expecting him for a few more days and before I could say anything he told me about how he pulled a favor with his boss (whom he's friendly with) and because the team had pretty much finished up their project he got the go ahead to head home early. Ben told me that he saw the picture and was speechless for a few minutes because he had never expected anything like that from me but knew he had to get home right away to see me. And then he said he felt like the luckiest man in the world.\n\n\nWe've spent every day together since and we've had a fabulous time and I've never felt better about my relationship and about myself. Ben has already asked if he'll get another picture anytime soon. I told him \"Only if you're good\" :)\n\n\ntl;dr: Sent picture, discovered I now need to get a full wardrobe of sexy lingerie. I feel great!",

            "This post makes me feel a little sad about my own situation, but luckily also amazingly hopeful because it reminds me what I could have myself someday. I've sent my boyfriend pictures in the past and, just like you, worried and fretted about what kind of response I'd get. \n\nNothing. Not a single reply. Not until I asked in person next time I saw him about it, and he said \"oh yeah I did get them, forgot to reply\" *kiss*. It honestly sorta devastated me, and I've yet to send him any pictures after that...sexy or not. \n\nNot to hijack your post, just reminding you how lucky you are!! You are amazing, your boyfriend is quality and this whole post is a much needed reminder of the kinds of things people do for each other in healthy relationships. I wish you two all the best, it sounds like you both are lucky to have each other:)",

            "Here's the thing, lady; it sucks that you have such a negative view of yourself, and my heart goes out to you. And sadly, it's so common, because women (and men, but women especially) are bombarded every day with messages on what beauty is and how they're supposed to look and what most men find attractive... And that's obviously BS. But it hurts women's self esteem just the same.\n\nBut your BF is with you because he loves you and thinks you're beautiful. When he got those pictures, he probably went insane, got a boner, and spilled his items. And when he said it was sexy, you can tell he meant it, because he went out of his way to get the hell home so he could DOOOO YOOOOOU!!! And also hang out with you because you're his best friend.\n\nMy wife is so self conscious. She really hates her body some days, and that she's bigger/curvier than how she's \"supposed\" to look. But her body type is my ideal body type, and when she's dressed cute, it makes my brain shut off, it's so awesome. \n\nSo, please believe that you are beautiful, and you are desired and loved. And if you can, change your self talk from mostly negative to mostly positive. :)",

I told her that I didn't want her to think I was implying anything, but that if it were me, I would want to know, and I thought she would want to know, too.\n\nShe already knew. Not because they're in an open relationship, but because he had been having a three month texting \"affair\" with a girl last year. After that girl found out about Annie, she wrote Finnick a letter about how brokenhearted she was, then Finnick 'fessed up to Annie.\n\nAnnie said she doesn't really considering it cheating, and that's fine, because it's her relationship and so she and Finnick get to determine the dealbreakers.\n\nI think she was a little concerned, though, because apparently he told her that he had deactivated/deleted his account, and that clearly didn't happen. She texted him when we were together and told him that someone else had found his profile. He apologized and swore that he didn't have the app downloaded but that he would go ahead and make sure his account is deactivated.\n\nI don't know how many people were really looking for an update, but I did get helpful advice on my last post and I really appreciated everyone's input.\n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: I am not a fan of Finnick.

            "I\u2019m so sorry.  But thank you for sharing.\n\nThe timing of your post is hitting me hard. My boyfriend of 11 years told me in April that he would propose in July. This was not our first discussion. He texted me a little while ago today that he had some errands after work and would be late getting home. One might think that\u2019s a good sign. But I think he was just out buying clothes. I think he\u2019ll have more excuses when I talk to him on Aug 1st. Your post makes me wonder if it\u2019s worth trying to salvage things after that. ",
            "This exact same thing happened to me. I was with my ex for 4 years, engaged for 2 of them. Set the date, bought the dress, sent invites out. Then he backed out. Said he wanted to be with me but didn\u2019t want to get married. We tried to make it work for a few months afterwards but our relationship was broken. Looking back, I am so happy that we didn\u2019t get married. He wasn\u2019t the one I am supposed to be w forever and he saved me from a mistake. Take care of yourself and be gentle with your healing. \n\nEdit: spelling ",

            "This exact thing happened to me. Happy to discuss it privately if you want to. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re probably spent on this issue but if you decide otherwise, PM me. 5 years together, last 6 months engaged, broke up with me the morning of our engagement party, after entire family flew in to town for it. It\u2019s been several years. Willing to share what little wisdom I gained from it. ",
            "If it makes you feel any better when a relationship gets to this point and marriage has been a question for a long time you might have changed your mind even if he had proposed.  It's not JUST about the marriage but an overall lack of commitment to the relationship. I was in a four year relationship with a guy I thought was the one regardless of how much we fought and struggled and argued.  \n\nWhen my dad died I really got a sense of my own mortality and that I wasn't happy in the relationship. When I broke up with him he revealed that he was finally getting ready to propose (and even showed me his search history with rings and everything) but by that point it had become a pissing match and I was done.  I realized at a certain point it had become a power struggle over things we didn't even want anymore.  \n\nIt took another four years but I eventually met a guy who wanted me as much as I wanted him and we were on the same page about everything.  Find the person who you can say anything to, who doesn't hold aspects of your relationship hostage, who is on the same page emotionally with you and you'll be happy. It still takes work, obviously, but you're not pouring your love and heart into a bottomless pit.  \n\n",
            "It was the right thing to do.  It's incredably hard but ultimately right. Sometimes it is just easier to stay with what you have instead of moving on because it is just that, easier.  Jobs, husbands, homes, investments and yes, pre-husbands (i.e boyfriend) are all just easier to stay with because you feel you've invested so much time so it really should work out. Please know you made the right decision and take some time to figure out the next chapter. ",

            "My (28F) ex heart school sweetheart (28M) of 11 years broke up with me in October after two years of going back and forth over marriage. He also used the I am not ready excuse, I am too young, my chest hurts, bla bla. He fell into deep depression which made me fall into deep depression, anxiety. He moved away and starting talking to another woman (complete opposite of me) for support, cliche. I saw a therapist and used my family and friends as support but I can finally say I am much better. I forgive him for everything because everything happens for a reason. Having a heavy heart will get you nowhere. \n\nI ended up focusing on my career and now will be moving across the world for a better career opportunity which I would not have gotten if I had stayed with him. Best thing to do is learn to love yourself.\n\nI DODGED A BULLET, as well as you! He can be someone else\u2019s mess now :) \n\nI come from a culture where being 28 and single is frowned upon but you know what, not going to settle for the heck of it. Do you girl!",
            "Marriage is a commitment and even if he did still love you that fact he didn't want to cement it was definitely cause to break up with him, I mean 6 years and you'd been living together for a while too I'm assuming what was he waiting for? Some kind of green light to go off on your forehead saying marry you? I married my gf after 3 years (got real close after we had deaths on both sides) at 23. We are 30 now been together for 12 years and had our first son.\n\n you will find that person who sees you as more than just a commitment but as a companion for Life.",
            "That took a lot of strength but I think it was the right decision. Take care of you now.",
            "I\u2019m so sorry you two broke up. You will find a man who will so badly want to marry you, he will tear up watching you walk to him on your wedding day, tearing up because of how lucky he feels to make you his wife. You are so young so please do not feel like this is it. There is a man out there for you, you will get your beautiful January wedding my love\u2764\ufe0f",
            "I'm sorry to hear that this was the outcome.   Be kind to yourself! ",
            "1) Hugs and good vibes.\n\n2) 6 years was a long time and it was long enough for him to have made up his mind one way or another. Kudos to you for having the courage to leave rather than getting increasingly resentful as you waited to see if he would ever be ready to get married.",
            "I'm so sorry, OP. It boggles my mind that after *6 years* together that your boyfriend *still* wasn't ready, it doesn't take that long to know if this is the person you want to be with forever or not. It kind of seems as if he's the type of person to never know if he even wants to get married in general. My relationship of 5 years ended last month due in part to this, my ex also wasn't ready among many other problems. Sending much love your way, you deserve a partner who is excited to marry you and build a life together with you.",
            "OP, I want you to know that odds are he probably will be engaged quite quickly in his next good relationship. A lot of guys who have stayed in LTRs that couldn't commit will realize their mistake on losing out on a partner and do whatever it takes not to make the same mistake on their next best bet at a happy ending. When this happens, please don't beat yourself up over it. It's not you, it's him.  \n  \nLook after yourself and focus on your goals and dreams. You're still young, you have time. Good luck with everything.",
            "Thank you for updating and staying strong to yourself. EmergencyLychee's perspective and advice is spot on, but it's definitely not going to feel that way for a while.\n\n\nBut I promise you that you will eventually be proud and satisfied that you ended an unworkable relationship so quickly and responsibly.  \n\n\nI still occasionally have brief and embarrassing flashbacks to the previous LTR I had and it's rough, but mercifully (in retrospect) quick end.  It may not make sense outside of my head, but I actually feel most embarrassed at the obvious red flags I ignored and the time and effort I wasted at the end trying to fix it, not at the pain of the breakup. \n\n\nWhen you've moved on to better parts of your life and better relationships, I think this is how you will eventually see this moment too.",
            "I remember your post very well. I'm really sorry this is the way it ended.",
            "Hey there OP! I remember your post. I'm sorry it worked out that way for you, but now you can regroup, and then find someone that wants to be married to you as much as you want to be married to him.\n\nI stayed with a guy for 20 years. 20! That was never willing to marry me, and always moving goalposts. (We can try for a baby when you have better health insurance/more money in the bank/house is fixed up/that next promotion etc)\n\nI'm 46 now, and never got to get married or have children. Our relationship is ending because the anger and resentment I feel towards him killed our relationship. (in fairness, he finally did become willing to get married and/or try for a baby when I was 42ish. Probably figuring the chances I could actually conceive were close to zero, so he'd go through the motions. Or he realized I was serious about ending things so he 'caved in'.) By that time, it was way, way too late. \n\nSo, anyhow, my TL;DR - is: Be glad you didn't stay and end up like me 14 years later! 46 isn't 'old', but I wish, so much, I had left when I was 32, started wanting kids and he started stalling me.\n\nYou did the right thing OP. My best wishes moving forward, I hope you give us an update about how great you're doing in a year. Onward and upward!",

            "Sorry OP. I know it feels like your whole heart got ripped out. I'm hoping it gets better quick and you can clearly see the next person in your life in line with what you want and need from a SO. Don't settle. Be relentless in your pursuit of joy and happiness. ",

            "I\u2019ll try it give you the same advice I give female friends from years of watching relationships ;\n\n- Believe someone\u2019s actions. Dont assume they\u2019re going to change tomorrow or eventually and just start doing what you wish they\u2019d do or wanting what you want.  \n\nWas someone just rude for 365 days? They\u2019ll probably be rude tomorrow.\n\nWas someone not a thoughtful or attentive bf for 365 days? Accept their behaviour when they show it to you over and over and over. \n\nDid someone avoid doing something for 1,095 days? They will avoid it tomorrow too!\n\nIf someone truly wants to do something, they\u2019ll do it. \n\nIs someone interested in romance? They\u2019ll be romantic. \n\nInterested in a great relationship? They\u2019ll be reasonable and thoughtful. \n\nAccept what they\u2019re showing you. \n\n\u201cAccept their behaviour at face value. As it\u2019s being presented. They\u2019re showing you who they are. Believe them!\u201d\n\nNever just assume \u201cWell I\u2019m unhappy with _____ , ______ , and _______. He doesn\u2019t do ____ or ______ even though he knows he should. I\u2019ve told him over and over it\u2019s important. He agrees he should do it. But then he doesn\u2019t.\u201d.... is going to suddenly change after months or years. \n\n...... because he doesn\u2019t want to. \n\nStop staying in relationships with people who want different things who you have to drag through life or fight with for them to see your point of view. \n\nIf a persons actions say \u201cI know you want that. I don\u2019t wanna do that. I wish you just didn\u2019t want that so my life was easier\u201d ..... instead of just assuming that since they\u2019re objectively wrong they\u2019ll eventually see your point of view and want something different .... believe them. And move on. \n\nYou\u2019ll find someone who wants what you want. They\u2019ll find someone who wants the same lifestyle. Everyone wins. \n\nHow do you get to that point? \n\n2. Judge people\u2019s actions. Take the time to be cognizant of and discern the meaning behind other people\u2019s behaviour. Aka be a good judge of character. \n\nFind out what their actions are ascribed to. \n\nAsk a guy if he wants kids. \u201cSure. One day, yeah. \n\nThis means. \u201cYea. Maybe. One day. It\u2019s not something I ever think about it or assign any value to that idea or plan\u201d \n\nIf he says \u201cYea. Of course....\u201d then precedes to tell some long story about hanging out with nieces and nephews etc..... that\u2019s a guy who puts value in that.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s that important? He\u2019d be more willing and ready to make actions to move towards that. \n\nBe aware of what people actually value and want in life. Don\u2019t just let them tell you they value something while they clearly don\u2019t, especially as a means of avoiding a hard conversation. \n\nAt the end of the day people will act on what they want. If they\u2019re not acting on it, then they don\u2019t really assign much value to that. It\u2019s kinda that simple. Just freaking take their behaviour at face value. It makes life so much easier. \n\nBe a grownup. Stop and say \u201cThen let\u2019s do this! Shouldn\u2019t we be excited for this if we both want it?\u201d....\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think if you actually wanted ______ , you\u2019d do ________ ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou doing/notdoing _______ has made feel like you aren\u2019t interested in _______ or we aren\u2019t on the same page. I just wanna know we\u2019re in this together. I just want some follow through from you to know that you want this as much as I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want this I need to know. It\u2019s ok to express concerns or tell me you want something different. Don\u2019t just tell me what I want to hear to avoid discussing it.\u201d\n\nShould you have to say any of that? No lol. It\u2019s not your job to raise people or teach them how to respect others. It\u2019s not your job to transition people from selfishness to selflessness. Find someone who already made the journey. \n\nCause guess what? You\u2019re probably going to spend years expecting them to change and repeating the same cycle with them of expecting more over and over. Til years go by and they didn\u2019t ducking change lol. \n\nAnd now you\u2019ve invested years. And he thought you would\u2019ve just accepted him and dropped all your wants and accepted mediocrity years ago. \n\nWtf right? How could he be such an idiot to think you were going to just completely change one day after years as long as he waited long enough?\n\nOh wait. Isn\u2019t that what you just did with him? Oh no, that\u2019s different right? Cause you told him every day what you wanted.  Well hun, so did he. With his actions. You just chose not to listen. \n\nAnd he\u2019s angry and resentful you still want him to change. \nYou\u2019re resentful he\u2019s not interested in building the right future with you. \nAll this could have been avoided if you just believed him. \n\nSource : Am guy. We\u2019re the worst. Sorry. \n\nEpilogue : You two break up. He wakes up. Actually realizes how complacent he had become in the relationship. Suddenly finds value in the ambition and thoughtfulness you always wanted him to have while with you. He\u2019s married now and is expecting. She looks so happy. He makes her happy. She has the life you always wanted. \n\nYou hear the tip of the spoon hit the bottom of the ice cream. ",
            "Thanks for posting OP, it seems like you ultimately made the right choice. good luck with everything! To those who are commenting about being in a similar situation... \nJust putting it out there but I [F 31] proposed to my husband. I got tired of waiting and was sure we both wanted to get married (because we talked about it) but I knew he was stressed out about being able to afford the ring and all the pressure of the proposal. I bought him a ring and myself a matching band (spent about $400 for both as men\u2019s rings are way cheaper) and proposed to him in front of the fire while on a camping trip. People are always shocked when I tell this is but what\u2019s the big deal? So I didn\u2019t get a diamond, I saved up and got the wedding band I always wanted and love. We\u2019ve been married for almost two years and have a great relationship. Not all men would appreciate this, but a confident man who\u2019s secure in who he is in the relationship won\u2019t be emasculated by this, my husband felt relieved that I didn\u2019t care about any of the traditions that put pressure on men. Talk about a double standard! :) \n",

For my 30th birthday he surprised me with a trip to NYC where I thought he would propose and by the second day I became so paranoid I broke down angry and upset that I ended up ruining my own proposal....all in all I get where you are coming from...Its so hurtful when you share a relationship and you and your partner are not on the same page...I hope somehow it works out for you guys because Ill say that  I thoroughly enjoy being married thus far..its been almost a year and a half and I guess he needed to make this decision when he was ready to be fully committed....wishing you guys all the best",

He took it back, it stung, but we discussed our relationship in detail. I had to really question myself why I even wanted marriage, because I'm not religious and don't really believe in the \"nuclear family\" model. I came to the conclusion that it's due to societal pressure, and I'm actually ok not being married. I feel like he's committed to me, and I don't need a piece of paper to prove that, and I would never want to force him into a situation that he might later regret. I found some peace within myself, and we seem to be settling over it as a couple. \n\nI'm not sure what's in your heart right now, or how you're feeling, but I hope you find peace, friend. \ud83d\udc9c",

Financially, legally, and even when it comes to custody and children at least currently there aren\u2019t many upsides for men in the US.  I\u2019m speaking as a married father of two. I have several divorced friends and for the men in those scenarios there abilities to afford normal lives with child support, alimony, and paying for secondary living expenses is impossible. I think we all know how these scenarios typically play out so you are asking your SO to risk his entire adult life on this relationship. Since they work 50% of the time thats a pretty serious risk. \n\nI talk with my wife a lot and life is tough and it throws a lot of curve balls your way and you can\u2019t control it. Doesn\u2019t mean your bad or weren\u2019t meant for eachother or insert any other cliche\u2019 here about relationships. Some of the best ones don\u2019t work because some real life stressors got in between people and sometimes that is no one\u2019s fault. \n\nSo I am not trying to change anyone\u2019s mind or say either of you are wrong especially since it seems you both are being very mature about this - all I\u2019m saying is if I was ever single again, which I don\u2019t want, I doubt seriously I would consider marriage, in a legal sense, ever again.

I would like to legally become your son and would be delighted if you would consider adopting me.\n\nI already consider you to be my mother and this would not change our relationship.

It will be one of the most precious gifts she ever receives.",

I hope you can do it ahead, you could start the process this Christmas, lots of options there.\n\nMaybe you can give her a \"Certificate of Adoption\". You can get it made to say (anyone with basic graphic media skills and a modifiable template) anything your heart desires, how great a Mom she is, so great in fact, you're officially adopting her! It won't be legal, but it will be from the heart, since she already lives there anyways. \n\nYou can even write out a little 'small print' area at the bottom, where you say if she'd like to make it legal too, it would be an honor. So the gift would be half a declaration gift to her, and half invitation - that in your heart, she's loved and known as Mom.",

I think if you're nervous just showing him your post is a great way to get the conversation started.\n\nAssuming all goes well with dad, though, that doesnt answer the question of how to ask mom. Dad might have some suggestions on how to go about that, but since your initial question was how to ask her, here's a thought for when you get to that part.\n\nAs has been pointed out, legal processes take time. But, that doesnt mean your desire for stepmom adopting you cant start on Christmas still. Definitely run this idea by dad to gauge how she might respond (since this is definitely a big deal) but what comes to mind is using your post here again. But this time, have a print out or it's open on a device you then stash in a box and wrap for stepmom to open Christmas morning. Hopefully, and ideally, stepmom will feel as strongly as you do about your wish to make it official, so this could be a meaningful Christmas gift to you both. Thos is why you need dad in on this, and maybe he can do some circumspect investigating/priming to make sure all is going to go as planned. \n\nHell even if she knows it's coming, having the official request from you to her happen on Christmas would make your Christmas wish come true, and hopefully mom's as well.

            "This is very sweet of you and I am sure Rashida would love it.\n\nAs others said this needs to go through your dad. If the bio mom is alive there may be alimony or child support. Also if the bio mom is alive then she has to sign off on your adoption giving her rights as a parent away. She might not want to or it could lead to custody battle due to parental alienation. If bio mom is dead there still may be legal issues, she or her parents could have left you money in a fund/trust for when you are 18 and that needs you to remain her son. \n\nEither way, lawyers will be involved so it's best to ask dad how to proceed.",
            "I work in adoptions and do step parent adoptions all the time! I love doing them. I get to see families that have been in place for years make that relationship official. I don't know what state you are in so I will give general advice and tell you what some of the people did in your situation. \n\nFirst, get your dad on board and make sure it's something that can be done and that it's something Rashida also wants. Step parent adoptions are generally more lenient than other adoptions so there should not be too many barriers (as long as it's something everyone wants and your step mom doesn't have any child abuse or significant criminal history). They don't take super long either, but there is a process that will take several months.\n\nSecond, maybe have your dad call around to some local agencies to see what the procedures are so you are all prepared. \n\nThird, if your bio mom has not been around, doesn't give gifts for birthdays, doesn't visit, call, provide child support, has abandoned you, etc, it would be relatively easy to prove in court that her rights should be terminated which would free you for adoption. Sometimes parents come forward to contest or say they won't agree to ak adoption, some don't respond, and others give a voluntary consent. Just remember your bio mom will need to be at least tried to be notified and informed of the plan. \n\nFor the fun part, I've had cases where the family gets the legal adoption papers and wraps them up as a gift. They're not filled out or anything. They can be blank. You can get them from your county courthouse or even online. Don't worry about having all the rights ones for this--you can do that later. Then step mom can open the papers on Christmas and you can get started on the process. \n\nOther kids have made pictures asking for step parent to adopt, some write it in a card. \n\nIf you need help with wording, kids have often said to me that their step parent has been mom/dad since they were little, and they would like to make the relationship official. \n\n(Some people might say she doesn't need to adopt you for you to be her child, and that's true, but the benefit of an adoption, especially in this situation, is if something were to happen to your dad, this would ensure you get to stay with her and your siblings.) \n\nSay you love her so much and you have always felt like her child and you'd like if she would want to make it official/permanent/legal. That's all it will take. My guess is she already sees you as her son and it won't take much on your part to convey your message.\n\nIF something were to happen to prevent an adoption now, know that adult adoption is a thing and while you'd have to wait a few years, it can be done once you turn 18.",

If he thinks that it is doable ask him to help you do a proposal version of adoption.   \n\nMaybe buy her a mother\u2019s necklace with a charm representing you.

Will you adopt me?",

It's amazing to have a great step mom, you are lucky.  \nYou can't convince her to adopt you though.  \nThis is something that has to be decided between your dad and her.  \nAsking her directly will put too much pressure on her and she likely loves you too.  \n\n\nTell your dad how you feel.  \nAll the best to you.",

In turn, this really screwed up my 18 year old brother, who turned to drinking. This is how things were for a while, until about august, when my brother got a dui. Wrecking a car my dad had just bought him. And my dad isn't rich by any means. He's unemployed, with virtually no money. At this point my dad went virtually insane. Then, my dog, and cat died. Not exactly helping. Then, in december my dad finally decided to go to an impatient facility, he came out two weeks later, feeling good. For about a week. He went back a month later. Same deal, felt good a week, went back. And now we're here. He came out, same thing. But now, he's totally estranged. He told my mom \"I loathe you, fuck you.\" and won't give her back the $6000 he owes her. So my mom is also financially fucked up now. My brother is in constant conflict with my mom, and my mom is crying almost everyday. I just don't know what to do, I'm mind bogglingly stressed everyday and can't focus on anything.\n\n tl;dr: family coming apart, dad resents mom for no reason, 18 yo brother picking up drinking",

            "The best way to support your family is to support yourself. It sounds selfish, but if you spiral with your family, you won't be able to do anything to help at all.\n\nYou are under so much pressure, but you are not alone. You can get through this.\n\nWhat can you do to take care of yourself? Would staying with friends or other family help you feel safer? Are you open to speaking with a therapist? Would finding a support group where you can speak with people in similar situations help?\n\nEven starting just by opening up to a teacher you trust or a school counselor who can help you find the resources you need could be an excellent first step. But please do what you need to do to keep yourself safe and sane. We love you so much.",
            "It\u2019s normal to want to help your family. It\u2019s normal to feel guilty that you can\u2019t help them now because you are 14yo. Spend as much time on sleep overs with relatives and friends as possible. Try to go to summer camp this summer, either as a camper or counselor. Be around as many healthy ppl as possible as much as possible. Join after school activities. Join a homework club. Babysit. Go to the mall. Talk to your youth pastor if you are involved in that world. In short, take care of yourself everyday. Really focus on yourself and your well-being. You will get through this. You will be okay. Take it one day at a time.",

            "About the only advice I can give is don't drink, smoke, toke, or do drugs. Don't even do it once. Addiction sneaks up on you. You don't even realize it until it's too late, and then you're stuck with it even if you quit and go sober. It really screws up your life.\n\nThe reason I'm giving you this advice is because you seem to be at the perfect point in your life for addiction to strike. I can't give advice to fix what's going on in your life, but I can give advice on how to avoid what has screwed up my life.",
            "Oh man that's a lot.  It's really hard to deal with addiction in the family even as an adult.  It's important for you to remember that even when your dad and your brother are messing up, it's not your responsibility to fix them.   There isn't really anything you can do except take care of yourself.",
            "This is not your fault. You are amazing just for looking for ways to fix this. Do you have any friends that you can talk to or grandparents that you can stay with? I'm so sorry that you are dealing with this. Try to focus on hobbies and other ways to deal with the stress you are dealing with. Maybe join some clubs at school or a sport if you can. Try to talk with your brother about how you are feeling if you feel like you can trust him.",
            "Oh honey I\u2019m so sorry I can\u2019t give you advice. Where are you located? Maybe update that and people can be more specific with resources",
            "I'm so sorry that you are going through such a hard time. As others have already mentioned, their issues are not your issues. Try and focus on making sure you have what you need to be okay and try and leave their problems to them.\nYour father and brother both need to work some stuff out themselves it sounds like, no one will be able to help either of them until they are ready to receive help. So don't take their problems on your shoulders. Let them know you love them and care about their wellbeing, but they shouldn't try and push their problems onto you. You're too young for that. You don't need to feel responsible for them and their life choices. \n\nYour mom is obviously dealing with a lot, I assume she works to try and make ends meet and your dad refusing to pay her back what he owes adds extra stress. From what he said to her it sounds like he might hold something against her, maybe from their divorce or before, but that's also for him to work out. It's now your mom's job to focus on providing for herself, you, and your brother, until your brother decides to move out and provide for himself.\n\nFrom what you've written, it sounds like you and your brother live with your mom. If that's accurate, and you are on good terms with her, my suggestion would be to maybe talk to her and see if there are small things you could do to help her out. It doesn't have to be big things, you're only 14 and you're not expected to become the man of the house. Find small things around the house you could do to help take some stress off of her so she can focus on providing for you. Clean up around the house or make a meal or two a week. You don't need to go out and find a job. Again, you're only 14, your job is to focus on your schooling and get good grades to be able to graduate and set up a better future for yourself.\n\nIt's good to see that you are trying to seek advice somewhere. If there is extended family or close friends you could also reach out to if you feel that's necessary, that might be a good step to take as well.\n\nI wish you well and hope you have a positive update to report in the future \ud83d\udc96",
            "This hit hard for me, I could have written this at 14. Suddenly, my stable parent became an alcoholic, and I experienced a lot of the loss that you are describing.\n\nWhat I wish I knew at that age:\n\n1.) You aren\u2019t responsible for parenting your parents. At 14, you don\u2019t have the capacity to handle a parents problems, and that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay to be selfish and put yourself first.\n\n2.) Don\u2019t be silent- tell your aunts or uncles, your teachers, your counselors. It\u2019s not loyalty to keep everything inside, because your parents and you are struggling. There are so many resources out there to help you.\n\n3.) Never engage anyone when they are drunk. The promises they make will not be kept, they can go from happy to angry for no reason. You can\u2019t help them overcome their addiction. \n\nI know you are going through difficult times, but it does get better. I can\u2019t guarantee your family will get better, but YOU will be fine.",
            "You need to focus on yourself. You can't help your family. But are your needs being met? If not, are there ways you can get help for yourself?",
            "You are 14.  None of this should be on your shoulders.  You didn't make your brother drink and drive and you certainly didn't turn your dad into an addict.  Your mom is struggling as well and when both parents are not being very parental, life can suck.  Just don't own it.  Do you have relatives around that you can lean on/live with?",
            "Dude, days like your describing were normal to me too, I went through 2 messy divorces by age 14. It really really sucked.  Im sure your situation is different but I feel for you. Im so sorry you gotta deal with all this stuff bro, and I\u2019m here for you.  I can\u2019t make it any easier for you but what I can tell you is that I managed to make a good life outta what I have... What you\u2019re going through, as messed up as it is, is temporary. Remind your folks and brother that you love them. Help when you can. Focus on what you gotta do for you, and as you move forward don\u2019t look back.",
            "This might not work for you, but if your are religious at all, even a little bit, think of reaching out to a church/synagogue/temple/whatever. They may be able to offer your mom some money or food, and they might be able to provide a minister/pastor/rabbi/lay leader who could take some time to talk about what you are dealing with. If religion is not a good fit for you, your school may have a guidance counselor who can  help direct you to someone who can help.",
            "I want to send you cookies and hugs.  That sucks kid!  Life is just like that.  Please have faith that little by little it will get better.  And you\u2019ll look back on these days as something to compare normal days with. To help realize that normal days are absolute blessings.  Some day not to far off. And you\u2019ll be able to appreciate them.  Unlike so many people who get down about small stuff.",
            "It's okay to not be okay. No matter who you are, navigating such an incredibly stressful and difficult time would be extremely challenging. \n\nFocus on self-care, and to the extent you can, help others with the same. \n\nSelf-care means make sure you're eating decently, stay hydrated, get enough sleep when you can, shower regularly, and just focus on nailing the essentials of basic health and survival. \n\nPast that, stay up on your school work, help out around the house, and just keep moving forward. \n\nNothing is going to make this period unstressful, so don't act like freedom from stress is an achievable goal. Use your extra spoons to help your mom, siblings, and dad to the extent you can. \n\nI'm sorry you're going through this, and I'm especially sorry to hear about your pets, but you can get through this. \n\nBelieve it or not, just seeing someone else in the family working on self-care and taking care of essentials really helps other people to realize they should be doing the same thing. So moving steadily forward doesn't just help yourself, it helps others.",
            "Are there any relatives or friends homes u can stay at?",
            "I dealt with some similar stuff when I was a kid. Honestly, you have to understand that it's not your fault and you aren't responsible to fix anything. And ya know what, no matter how hard it gets, you'll get through this. For me, the biggest thing that helped me finally start to feel like I had some sanity and control over my life was when I got a car. I was able to get a cheap car of Craigslist and it truly changed my life. Just being able to get out of the house whenever I needed to escape worked wonders for me. If you have any good friends who can come and pick you up (or their parents) if you need to get out or have a hot meal, I highly recommend that too. Work hard in school so you can get scholarships to college and get a good job when you graduate so you're not dependant on your parents anymore. And, if I'm honest, you may way to set up some small savings funds to start saving for when your parents inevitably have to stop working and can't afford to live anymore (if helping them is something you think you'll want to do). \nAnd just so you know, my dad also had to go to to rehabs and anger management but he transformed a lot over the course of my life and he and I are actually really close now. My mom is a different story, but I'm still a lot happier now living in my own place and interacting with my parents only on my own terms. I honestly still can't believe that I haven't had to worry about the electric being out for months at a time since I graduated and it feels so good. You'll get there.",
            "Im sorry, man. Situations like this are awful and unfortunately there\u2019s not much you can do aside from being there for your mom and brother (as much as possible). I hope things turn around for you, keep your head up and don\u2019t forget to take time for yourself and your interests. You\u2019re so young and this kind of burden can steer your life off path. I\u2019m rooting for you.",
            "When I was your age and my family was falling apart I thought I was alone (even with 4 siblings). I genuinely thought that I had it worse than anyone else. Anyway,  I had the opportunity to stay with a friend who I thought her family was perfect.... until I saw the other side. Turns out no one is perfect. I'm not telling you this to say that your struggles aren't that bad or someone has it worse so buck up,  but rather that I found it very comforting to know that there were other people out there fighting their own fight. My life now vs then is dramatically different (in a great way) so my best advice is to find any kind of security you can while using the adversity to fuel you.  I fully credit my teen year family stuff at making me a successful productive adult. Hang in there!!!",
            "Based on this there's not anything specific I feel I can say. I want to reiterate this isn't your fault. Your brother is at a time in his life that many go through a drinking phase - it doesn't mean he will always struggle. It's also not your battle to fight.\n\nYour father is responsible for his own mental health and your mother is responsible for her finances. Focus on doing well in school. If you want to go to post-secondary, focus on that. Don't feel obligated to get a job or leave school to help your mother, and don't try to \"fix\" your father - that is his job and that of a professional.",
            "I\u2019m so sorry. I feel your pain. I\u2019m 15 and my family is pretty messed up too. Sending you big hugs.",
            "Im really sorry this is happening. I don't have the best family either, and I'm always here if you need to vent onto someone. This isn't your burden though, and I hope you can get into a better situation soon.",
            "Well shit. I've been through all of that (except the brother, never had a brother, and my sister never showed an interest in bad driving or drinking) and even been the drunk myself before. I don't have a CLUE what to tell you except if you have any way of getting the hell as far away from that as you can, do it. All the things I've been through stemming from all of that stuff as a kid and later as an adult all over again, it wasn't worth the experience in any form of wisdom, personal growth, or whatever silver lining anyone tries to slap on it. It's all bullshit and it's all unfair.",
            "I'm sorry your family is going through all that,  it's frustrating when you're so young there's nothing you can really do about any of it.  As others have said,  take care of yourself first,  it should make your mom and dad feel better to see that at least you are okay.  I know it's hard,  but you will power through and will be a stronger adult for what you have gone through.  This past year has been so hard for so many people and there is much upheaval,  just breathe, try to meditate, do whatever you need to to keep your own self sane.",
            "I\u2019m so sorry, honey. The fact of the matter is that *none* of this is your responsibility to fix. You\u2019re a child, and while wanting to see your family members happy is natural, these are all very adult issues that you shouldn\u2019t have weighing on you. \n\nYou need to focus on yourself and your well-being. It isn\u2019t selfish, it\u2019s healthy. Do the best you can and please, don\u2019t feel at all to blame for any of this. \n\nDo you have a trusted adult you can talk to about all of this? A school counselor, teacher, aunt or uncle, or grandparent? You need help and deserve someone to talk to outside of the immediate family. If you\u2019re able to stay with one of them for a while, it might prove very helpful for you.",
            ">I just don't know what to do, I'm mind bogglingly stressed everyday and can't focus on anything.\n\nThere is nothing you can do.  Sometimes shiat happens in life that you can't do anything about.  You should focus on yourself first, don't try and fix other people that can't, or don't want to be fixed.  \n\nIf possible can you stay with grandparents for a while until things settle down?",
            "Aww. I\u2019m sorry. I grew up in a broken home and this last year my husband had psych and addiction issues which left him homeless. Don\u2019t give up. Keep your grades up in school, don\u2019t drink or so drugs, don\u2019t commit any crimes. Out yourself first. You\u2019re only 14. None of the other stuff is your fault or responsibility. I\u2019m so sorry",
            "I went through something very similar when I was about the same age. It was really overwhelming and the way I dealt with it wasn\u2019t healthy. I bottled up my fears, didn\u2019t ask for help, and tried to escape in ways that ultimately didn\u2019t serve me. \n\nAs others have said, it\u2019s important that you focus on taking care of yourself. The fact that you\u2019re here is really good because the best thing you can do is ask for help. It sounds like your mom is really overwhelmed and may need some support. Do you think that involving someone else to provide her with support would help? Are there other family members you could contact to get involved with providing that support? (Such as grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, or close family friends.) It shouldn\u2019t be up to you go fix things for your family, so if there is someone else you can connect with for help, I would start there. \n\nIf your mom won\u2019t accept support from family or if there isn\u2019t anyone you know who could help her, is there someone you might be able to live with temporarily? Perhaps a family member or a close friend who you trust and can take care of you while your mom sorts things out?\n\nAnother option would be to connect with someone at your school, like a teacher or a school counselor. If you share some of what you\u2019re going through, your teacher or counselor may be able to connect you and your family with resources in the community that can help. I\u2019m not sure what access to counseling is like where you are, but where I live there are many programs that provide free counseling for youth under 19. You could try googling \u201cfree counseling in ____\u201d and include your city\u2019s name. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re going through a really rough time. I hope things get better for you soon. If you have more questions or need more advice, let us know.",
            "I\u2019m so sorry. For you",
            "Hey man, I'm  a counsellor who specifically works with young people and people with substance use issues. I'm also currently working in the justice department in my country. I won't give specific advice over Reddit, but I can give general information. Please see a professional in your area if or when you're able and feel the need.\n\nIt sounds like there is so much going on in your family right now and it sounds like its really taking a toll on you. \n\nThe first thing I would say before anything else, is that the other comments that say you should support yourself as best you can. In our industry, we refer to the oxygen masks in airplanes as a metaphor, and say you should fit your own mask when things get rough before helping others. Fit your own oxygen mask, so you can breathe, and then worry about other people.\n\nGenerally though, there are a couple of other things. Firstly, you are not responsible for anything that's going on with your family. Your parents seem to be struggling, and you are a 14 year old young man that's caught in the middle. You are not to blame. \n\nAlso, comorbidity with mental health and substance use is quite high, as is being in legal trouble. Economic stressors are also a predictor of relationship difficulties. In fact, while this may seem obvious to some, I will say that it sounds like all the \"virtual insanity\" and \"fucked up\" stuff is likely a result of people in your family not coping. Its clear that your family needs support on multiple levels.\n\nI think that's as much as I'm able to offer on a comment thread on Reddit. If you're feeling the urge to support and help your family, please seek another adult you trust, or a professional. If you need to focus on yourself, that is completely okay and you can give yourself permission to do that.\n\nAll the best.",
            "I am so sorry you are dealing with so much difficulty. \n\nI had a lot of issues when I was your age with my family fighting, not having money, having mental problems, and substance abuse. I handled it in both good and bad ways, but I'm on the other side of it at 28 and have been mostly self sufficient for a long time and I'm so glad I believed in myself and made it through that difficult and painful time..sometimes looking back, I don't know how I did it and I barely scraped by.\n\nWhat I can say is what some others reiterated, that taking care of yourself is primary! You won't be able to fix your family, you need to survive. I agree that finding ways to stay out of the house is helpful, but try to make them good ways. I almost ruined my life by finding bad ways to stay away. Luckily was able to course correct though.. staying with friends until things are more stable, or as often as you can; will be helpful. Make sure they are good friends though! I know things are tough with covid right now. But are there any extracurricular or sports or anything you could join? Staying busy and meeting other kids who are also staying busy and doing good things will be great.\n\nCan you possibly get a part time job, for yourself? Ic you do, save that money for you. Chip in with groceries once in a while, as in going to the store and doing the shopping and paying the cashier; but do not let your parents convince you to give it to them. Speaking of, working at a grocery store is a great first job.\n\nAlso, find something that motivates you, a vision for your future. Hold onto that deep down. Be patient with yourself on your journey..things will be up and down but always believe in yourself that when you're down you will be able to pull through and create that vision down the road. You don't have to figure out exactly what you want to do, but start thinking about what you want your life to look like. If you envision a happy college years, or 20s; what does that look like ? Hold onto that and know it's coming if you make it through this rough patch and let it inspire you to make it through and not give up.\n\nCan you find a therapist? Or speak to the social worker at school? Can you ask them about a group therapy for other kids struggling with family issues at home?\n\nAnd always always remember, it's not your fault and you are not responsible for fixing your family or your parents. That is their responsibility, and they are failing; not you. Do not let them guilt you into trying to take any sort of responsibility for the family. That is their job as parents, and if they're not that doesn't make it your job.",
            "Geez kid. I'm sorry you're going through this. Stay strong. Perhaps choose one person to support and invest your extra time into. Maybe they they can be an ally.",
            "You poor baby. I am sending you a virtual hug. In my mind i feel like you could benefit from the kind of hug that comes from an auntie that's a famiky friend who will keep your secrets, hold you and rock you like you are a baby, so you can feel safe and finally let out all of the tears I imagine you have been holding in.\n\nAside from all of that i want to remind you that none of these things are your fault or your responsibility to fix. But clearly all of this takes a great toll on you.  You are doing a great job of maintaining yourself, and you are asking for help which is incredibly commendable and says that you have a lot of strengths. Take pride in your strengths and taking care of the needs of others doesn't have to be one right now. Definitely get to a school counselor or trusted teacher or school admin. \n\nAlso even though we are in a pandemic try to get involved in activities you enjoy. This will keep you busy, change your environment, and hopefully build your network of support. \n\nI really do hope and wish the best for you.",
            "When I was 16 my closest dearest friend committed suicide and my mom was diagnosed with a terribly aggressive cancer. I was a total loser in high school and my hair all fell out when I was 11, if it wasn't bad enough. My dad was a convicted pedo from years back, emotionally unavailable at all times, and wasn't shy of being mentally/emotionally/physically abusive. I have to be real with you, I don't remember much of my teen years. It was a blur. But I stuck by my mother's side and I did what I had to in order to make sure my sanity mildly remained in tact. I ran the household as a 16 year old for a bit..I even when to work with my mother to help her there too. It can be done...it's so hard and you all deserve better...but life is super difficult and unfair sometimes and we just have to do what we can in the moment. Take every day one day at a time. Remember who you love most and stick by them through it. I had to stick with my mom...my dad, who I loved dearly despite the hell he made, took care of himself and only himself. That was what he was used to. So, I focused on my mom. My brothers and I were so far apart in age and weren't close until we were adults. I'm sorry you have to deal with this.

Do what you can to help those that deserve the help. When your environment is a living hell the only thing that makes it worse is adopting a resentful angry bitter attitude and it\u2019s not like you can be blamed for that one hit.

            "Your ability to focus your message in a clear, coherent, and cohesive way after what has been a tremendous year is impressive. You even come across as somehow being grounded. I\u2019m sorry about seeing changes in behavior in other family members and is what can happen when people are under more stress than they can handle. Im glad your brother is ok. Im sure he hates having wrecked the car (more than anyone) but a car is replaceable. I\u2019m so sorry about your cat passing. And just as much for your dog passing. I bet neither wanted to leave you either, in the same amount. Your parents have lived now at least 3x your age and for them covid/lockdown is completely unexpected. Add to that the whole political circus, they are mad at not being able to give you and themselves the life they are working so hard at. It is for you too but older people, and by their age, feel like they can anticipate/plan and adapt and now, not being able to, as if the rug was pulled from under them, and depending on so many things, it\u2019s rough in a different way is all. They have plans to be retired one day and know that you guys are on a good trajectory and this state we\u2019re in\u2014for lack of a better word\u2014pisses them off. They want to help you have that good life and they feel they cant right now. But this state we\u2019re in is temporary\n\nHearing your dad say that to your mom would surprise anyone whose never heard their dad speak like that. It seems to me he is in a lot of pain and frustration and so is your mom, brother, and you too and not being able to fix it or to anticipate *exactly when we return to a better normal is something we\u2019ve not faced before. What\u2019s important though, is that we will. Acceptance of not having a fixed day\u2014as hard as this is to do, can be liberating. \n\nWould you describe yourself as resilient? Your focused message, after all that transpired and seeking others\u2019 perspectives seems to suggest so, imo.  What are some interesting or new ways you have been passing time that are meaningful? Also, there is research that supports that taking walks in nature (park trails, hikes) can be very calming and introduce peace into your life. For when youre home and need to create a quieter space in your room, esp if you can hear arguing, and this is going to sound odd but i think helpful too\u2014earplugs. Not just any earplugs. Walmart sells a box of these tan ones, for about $4 and WOW, they provide near complete silence. I used them because a room mate would make a lot of noise and wake me up. Best decision ever (second to moving finding a new room mate haha\n\nHow are you doing in school? (Newsflash: no one is doing amazing in school, and your inability to focus is actually quite normal for a human. You are normal, not a robot) There is talk that after we are all vaccinated, we will be returning to in-person class again. Are you looking forward to it?

            "Talk to your dad, talk to you mom, talk to your brother. They've all been alive longer than you have and have serious perspective on this \"falling apart\" of which you speak. Your family is already apart so treat them as individuals who probably need a friend right now. As long as you have food and shelter then I'd consider taking on family repairs as a hobby because someday it might come in handy for your own life. Your dad taking 6k and saying he won't give it back is like nothing... It's more about how soon he can get it back to her even if it's 100$ a month. If he feels he's owed that money then he accepted it under false pretenses anyways and should be told he went about it the wrong way. Your mom needs to seek a counselor instead of taking it out on your brother. Your brother needs friends he can talk to and I think you're the only one who can relate to him right now. Alcohol is really good at what it does so I fear he'll be the hardest one to bring back to reality right now... even defend him when he gets into it with your mom.

            "I wish Reddit was a thing when I was your age. You're getting some good advice. I would start to talk to your teachers and your counselors. You might have to consider the possibility that your home isn't a place that is conducive to your long term life plans. You only have one life and often times one chance to position yourself in a good spot where you can live comfortably long term. \n\nYour stress is not normal because your environment is chaotic. You are a minor and the ones responsible for caring for you aren't psychologically sound to care for you effectively. I am so sorry that you're going through this but now is the time to be selfish AND THAT IS OKAY! \n\nGet a school counselor and your teachers involved tell them what is going on and that you're struggling. If I could go back in time and tell my younger self to do this I would because when I was young I didn't understand the impact that those traumatic experiences would have on my mental health down the line. You absolutely have to protect this and tbh you see that there is a history of mental illness in your family with your older brother and father. You are at risk for mental issues down the road and thr best thing that you can do to prevent this is to change your toxic environment. \n\nLet your family fall apart. It is not your fault. It is not your responsibility. You are a child and you need help so that you can develop into the best version of you possible to break the cycle.",

            "My heart is absolutely breaking for you, sweetheart.  The most important thing you need to know is that this is probably a blameless situation.  That is to say, it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault.  It sounds like the pandemic triggered or exacerbated some financial issues that are causing your parents some serious stress.  Even your brother, who seems to be acting out in dangerous ways, is not at fault.  Everyone\u2019s just stressed and trying to cope.  So try not to build up or harbor resentments against your family, and DEFINITELY don\u2019t turn inward and blame yourself!\n\nI\u2019d recommend talking with a school counselor ASAP.  Be sure to mention that you are safe at home (if, in fact, you are safe!) and that your dad is seeking help and I\u2019m reasonably confident that they won\u2019t try to do anything drastic like take you into foster care or anything like that.\n\nThere\u2019s a very good chance that things will get much better soon, okay?  I know it doesn\u2019t seem like it, but you\u2019d be AMAZED at how many families deal with stuff like this at some point or another.  I wouldn\u2019t call it normal, but I wouldn\u2019t actually call it completely abnormal.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you two things as a mother (my son is close to your age) that I hope will help:\n\n1. YOUR PARENTS LOVE YOU MORE THAN THEY LOVE THEMSELVES OR ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS WHOLE WORLD.\n\n2. Us moms are really, really strong.  We have feelings and we cry and we lose our shit and yell sometimes, but we generally pull through hell and high water for our children, if for nothing else.  So don\u2019t feel like you need to take on your mom\u2019s burdens for her or step up into a caretaker role that you\u2019re much too young for.  The best thing you can do for her, for you, and for everyone in your family is to take care of yourself.  \n\nDon\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t talk to her, though.  We know our kids feel it when we aren\u2019t holding it together very well, and we worry about you.  You guys putting on some brave face and hiding your feelings scares us to death.  So you know...go ahead and cuddle up next to mom and have a good cry when you need to.  Go hang out with her after school and tell her all about your awesome day and the girl in math class you think is pretty cute.  Ask her to play Among Us with you on her phone or to help you with your science paper.  Keep the lines of communication open.\n\nLean on a best friend or relative or trusted teacher.  If your family can get you therapy, go to therapy.  Find healthy ways to deal with these huge feelings you\u2019re having: cry, punch a punching bag, take up cycling or running or some new hobby.  Paint, write, draw.  Throw yourself into your schoolwork.  Zonk out on video games sometimes.  Whatever it takes to find that balance between coping and escaping in some HEALTHY way.  (As others have said, this isn\u2019t the time for you to start experimenting with alcohol, drugs, or physical intimacy.)\n\nYou\u2019re dealing with some pretty adult problems right now - don\u2019t try to do it alone!  Hang in there and don\u2019t lose hope.  Your dad will find the right balance of medications and therapy to get him through what he\u2019s going through, your mom will smile again, and your brother will mature out of this \u201cwilin\u2019 out\u201d phase he seems to be in.

            "Hey man, I am so sorry. I'm from a \"broken\" household myself and dealt with similar shit growing up. It's so heartbreaking, and it will nag at you for the rest of your life (although it will become more and more bearable as time goes on). For right now, even though you're in the middle of growing up and becoming an adult, you're still just a kid. The best thing you can do is try to focus on school and your hobbies and your friends (I know, I know, harder than ever with the pandemic). You don't have to get involved with your parents or your brother when they are experiencing issues. You can just say to each of them individually, at any time, \"Hey, just so you know, I love you, and I'm here to help if I can\" and then give 'em a hug. Your mom, your dad, and brother. That's the most you are able to do, and they will all appreciate it greatly.\n\nUltimately, as insane as things are, do your best to roll with the punches and try to focus on learning and becoming the best version of yourself that you can be. When you are an adult and maybe have a family of your own, you know what you won't want your household to look like. Again, I am so sorry that you are dealing with such traumatic hardship, but I believe that you can get through this. I had a somewhat-similar upbringing, and I got through it. You can do it. \n\nFeel free to message me if you want. I actually have a master's degree in counseling now, so I'm not exactly unequipped to talk about these things.",

For most kids I wouldn\u2019t say this, but for you it might be a refuge. Do whatever you can to keep it together for 3-4 years. People care. I care, the other people trying to find ways to help you here care... but realistically, we can\u2019t do much for you.

            "This all sounds so stressful and I really hope you find peace and your family is okay. \n\nI do agree with what other people have commented which is that the best thing you can do is take care of yourself, whatever that means. Put your life preserver on first so to speak. Is there somewhere safe near you you can go to cool down and get yourself settled on a regular basis? Try to think of things that are manageable and keep you happy that you can do regularly to keep yourself above water. Search for friends or other mentors you can talk to for moral support, and remember it's a very tough time right now, it's okay for you to feel your emotions.\n\nIt's unfortunate your family is having so many of their own serious issues. Someone should be stable to help you figure things out too, since you're just a teenager. There's not really one best way to cope, but maybe a regular friend weekly chat, mindfulness apps, an athletic or artistic outlet, or anything else that works for you will help you make it through this.",

I feel guilty once in a while, but staying wouldn\u2019t have prevent all these problems, it would have just brought me down! \n\nSo for the next 3-4 years, get help, find trustworthy people that can help you find your focus, do your best in school so that you can leave! Work as soon as you can to put money aside for when you leave, get a car so you can leave, but for the love of god, do yourself a favour and go! Don\u2019t get stuck in their drama! Have the life YOU want!",
            "None of this is your fault. Remember that.\n\nTalk to your school's counselor.\n\nIt seems like alcohol is at the root of your family's trouble.\nYou might want to  seek out Alateen or Alanon. \nEveryone will have been where you are now or were there at one time. They can help you wade through the shit.\n\nRemember, none of this is your fault.",
            "You should go to a family of addiction support group,  sometimes it's easier for addicts to blame others for their problems, that way they don't have to take responsibility for them and they can keep using guilt free.  \n\nI hope things get better.  Been there buddy, it gets better.",
            "There\u2019s nothing you can do but learn to grow up right the fuck now. Typically, remove yourself from that environment but being 14 makes it very hard. Unless you run to the ER and scream suicide, no one listens. What I\u2019m saying is, you need a help from another entity like a treatment center or some stable care that will allow you to process and deal with this madness because as you remain in the situation you\u2019re in, it just gets worse and worse. Ideally, one of your parents step up and end the madness whether it be finance or emotional, it\u2019s up to one of them to provide you a real environment where you can grow. That\u2019s not happening now. The only alternative is to find some way to change your environment and that will need the help of some other adult/organization",
            "I feel terrible for you. It\u2019s tough growing up with these challenges. Hang in there and just try to do as much as possible. These challenges can really help you later in life. Stay away from any drinking or drugs. They seem perfect in the short term, but you\u2019re seeing how they affect people long term. \n\nTake a walk and find a quiet place where the noisy chaos around you isn\u2019t there. Talk to a teacher or a counsellor when you need help. It\u2019s what they are there for. Plod through this, one day at a time and you will get through this. \n\nTell your Mom how important she is to you. She needs to hear something good sometimes. Being there to support her will help you cope as well.\n\nStay strong.",
            "You are doing an amazingly brave thing and the first step, in reaching out for help. Well done you!!! I\u2019m sure you will get help and support here.",
            "I am really sorry you are going through this, but if you are in frame of mind where you can pick yourself up do it. Don't stop for no one and just do some job or another. This might help you keeping your mind away from home",
            "Do not set yourself on fire to keep other people warm.\n\nRead that twice.",
            "I'm very sorry to hear this. This is so hard for you. At least you have one solid parent, your mom, who you can lean on.\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that all of this is out of control. You can't fix your dad. Only he can help himself. With the right mental health treatment, he can get better. But he has to find that and really try at the treatment himself. You can't fix your brother.\n\nI'd suggest that you write your brother a letter explaining your feelings, how scary the drinking is to you, and how much you love him. Then leave it at that.\n\nIt's healthy to express your feelings. You must feel angry, and so hurt, and maybe afraid. Insability is hard to deal with and you can see how your brother turned to alcohol to help cope with the uncertainty. I'd urge you not to follow him. It's so hard to watch our loved ones struggle. We want more than anything to save them. But we can't fix other people. They are not car engines.\n\nThere are a thousand paths in front of you and most of them are good. All the good paths start with taking care of yourself and ask for help. Tell your mom how you're feeling. Ask other family members for help. Your family needs help and you need emotional support. Bad things thrive in the dark, in secrecy. Throw some sunlight on these problems by asking for help. Here's an email that could work if sent to a teacher or guidance counsellor: \"I really want to find a way out of poverty when I graduate. My mom is fantastic and give sme a ton of support, but I want more advice on more positive outlets for my emotions or activities that might be help me.\" Here's a message that could work for your mom: \"Mom, seeing my dad and brother like this is tearing me up. I feel so low. I don't want to tell you how I feel all the time because I'm afraid of making you feel bad, but I feel bad right now because of what they're doing.\" \n\nI see the next five years as a path upward for you from this very difficult time. Progress isn't a straight swing upwards, and I see setbacks, and obstacles, and more unpredictable behaviour - all of that is outside your control. Right now, I see your dad and brother continuing to hurt themselves and you. But, more importantly, I can also see you asking for help and talking regularly to people you can rely on. I see you expressing your feelings, maybe journalling or writing music, or even talking to a therapist. You find positive outlets for your grief and anger, and they don't consume you.\n\nAfter asking for help, which you've already started to do here, I can see a path of healing and happiness in front of you. I see you initially struggling at school with all this chaos going on, but then finding a few things where you enjoy the challenges, and working hard to excel. This summer, I see you maybe working part-time and pursuing a few hobbies outside the house - maybe ask your coach at school about summer sports leagues, or ask a teacher about summer activities. At 16, you're hanging out at the library after school, in a few after school clubs, and playing games with your friends in the evenings. At 17, you're applying to university or trade school, maybe far away from your family. You're spending the summer working at an overnight camp in a more stable environment, and you have friends who are also pursuing further education or training after high school.\n\nPositive things are in your future if you open up and try to rely on reliable others. Your dad and your brother can't support you right now. But your mom probably has an open ear, and there are other trustworthy adults in your life who you can turn to for support. I'm sorry you're struggling with this. You did the right thing by expressing your feelings and letting it out here as a first step.",
            " Hey, I hear you, and it's completely alright to feel this way and want to support your family. I hope you feel like yourself soon and find a way to work things out with your family. Take it one day at a time and start with loving yourself. Only if you support yourself can you support and take care of your family. And you are not responsible for any of this, this is not your fault. All this is temporary and it will pass. Remind your loved ones you love them and take care of them when you can, keep yourself before them. You could also start doing things to divert your mind and help with stress and anxiety. Meet old friends and catch up on some old hobbies, you will be fine and your family too, soon. take care!"
