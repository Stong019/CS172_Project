Strange enough I think I needed to hear the advice from people I didn't know, rather than friends and family who have been hounding me for a long time.  \n\nI guess deep down inside, I always thought I deserved better but my self esteem has been lacking for so long that I thought my fiance was the best that I could do.  \n\nI honestly believe now that he has many priorities ahead of me.  One of you asked whether I thought he would drop everything if I ever got into an accident.  I'm not sure he would, and that scares me.  \n\nLast night, I gathered up the courage to confront him about everything: the lack of romance, the lack of dates, the fact that he won't pay for anything or contribute any ideas to our wedding, and sadly, he didn't really react.  He just told me he couldn't discuss it now and needed to deal with something at work.  \n\nI'm heartbroken and ended it on the spot.  While I'm sure I made the right choice, I'm still so lost.  I'm 30 and now single.  I wanted to be married by now and have kids.  Feels like I'm starting over.  Hoping for the best, but 40 or 50 more years of what I have now would have been miserable.  \n\nThank you all for freeing me.  I'm just trying to figure out how to pick up the pieces.  \n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Broke up with fiance for not caring about me or our relationship.  Trying to pick up the pieces.  ",

            "Hey, 30 is a great age to be single. You've still got your looks and energy, but you have enough relationship and life experience to impress the right kind of partners and steer clear of the bad kind. Yes, in the traditional narrative you're married by thirty and done popping out kids by 35, but the world is changing, and the path you're on now is full of potential.",
            "I'm impressed, do you realize how many people would have sadly caved when they heard \"I can't discuss this now, got work stuff.\" How many women in your position would've thought, \"OK, well at least I said what I needed to say and he's not mad, hopefully we can talk about it more this weekend.\" Cue another year gone before she even realizes it. \n\nBut that's not you! You saw through his bullshit and ended it. Seriously, I hope you feel really good about that. \n\nThat relationship wasn't a waste of time, you're now better equipped to spot the warning signs even earlier, and you have a much better idea of the kind of man you want to marry. Many people would've gone through with the wedding hoping it'd get better, but that's a fantasy. Be proud of yourself for not falling into that trap.",
            "I have a friend whose husband dumped her after 24 years of marriage (no kids, thank goodness.) She is in her early 50s and you know what? She met someone WONDERFUL and she has a fantastic life. 30 isn't very old at all. ",
            "It's better to be 30 and single than 35 and miserable with two kids under the age of 5 and essentially a single mother who happens to actually be married and living with your husband/kids parents. ",
            "I called off my wedding at 29, and now at 35 I have found my future husband who I have been with for 2 years.  I left an abusive fiance and it was a horrible year.  But I never looked back and never regretted it.  I have never been on as many dates in my life as I've had in my 30's! You couldn't pay me to go back to my 20's.  You will be fine!",
            "I am so proud of you for deciding to love yourself. Your future self will be so grateful to you for this. Keep being brave and don't look back, you made the right choice!!!",
            "Did he react at all after you broke it off? ",
            "REMEMBER that feelings aren't life. They are fleeting and they do change. No one has felt the exact same way for 50 straight years. This is a hard time, not the rest of your life.",
            "I broke up wth my boyfriend of *almost* 5 years about 3 years ago. \n\nI had the same problem, at the time I wasn't as confident and I thought my relationship was okay and would always tell myself things like \"no ones relationship is perfect\", \"all those romantic things are just for movies\" etc. and my friends and family kept making comments.\n\nI finally broke up with him and goddamnit it's so tough when you invest so much.  I'm so sorry for how you feel right now, I truly sympathize.\n\nBut making a decision that was **mine** for my own self interest, eventually gave me so much more confidence. I dated a while, had a 9month thing and a few shorter ones. Then I met my current SO.\n\nRomance does exist. We're only at 1.5 right now, but each and every day he makes me feel cherished, important, respected, and loved. He always finds new ways to surprise me, new ways to romance me.\n\nThose men exist, but before you find them, you have to find yourself.",
            "30 is the new 20! \n\nSeriously though you're going to be fine. Think about the exciting things you can do now! Meet somebody new, butterflies, first kisses! \n\nIt's going to be ok, it's going to be better than ok, it's going to be great!",
            "> I'm 30 and now single. I wanted to be married by now and have kids.\n\nDo it right the first time or regret it forever.\n\n30 is okay for kids, you still have time.  You have a chance at being a BETTER parent because you are wiser and experienced.\n\nEdit: I had my first at 21 (not too young) and I still cringe at the things I could have done better if I only knew....",
            "That was hard, but you did the right thing. You deserve so much more than what he was giving you. You'll be okay, just give yourself some time to heal. ",
            "Babe, I've been there. I was on the other side of the altar when I realized it, though. I thought my situation was the best that life had to offer, and I married against my better judgment, only to become pretty quickly miserable. \n\nAll I can say is that you should be happy about a lot of things. And by 'should be happy' about them, I mean that when the dust settles and you are in a better place than the blinding pain you're probably feeling right now, you will be happy about a lot of things. \n\nYou already recognize that if you're getting married to someone, you should be their top priority. \n\nYou already recognize that if you're not someone's top priority now, getting married isn't going to change that. \n\nYou already recognize that you deserve a lot better than you had, in terms of my first two points. \n\nAlso, you don't have children. \n\nI could go on and on on.  There's no need, you get it. When you're in a LTR and realize that not only will you never be a priority, you'll always be on the back burner, it is crushing. \n\nYou've got this, my friend. It sucks suck a big bag of dicks, but I promise you (pinky swear) it will get better. ",
            "> Hoping for the best, but 40 or 50 more years of what I have now would have been miserable.\n\nThe world is entirely open to you now, OP. Grieve, heal, and then invest in your own life. It will bring people to you.",

        "selftext": "[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3qg3i8/my_boyfriend_30m_of_16_years_wont_commit_to_me/)\n\nI just wanted to thank every one of you who took the time to read my first post and for all of the support I've received since.\n\nA lot has happened in the last couple of weeks, so I figured I'd post an update.  \n\nI hired a lawyer and moved out one day while Rick was at work.  Because my name is on the title and the mortgage, my lawyer assures me he either has to sell the house and split the profit with me, or buy me out.  I know he can't afford to buy me out, so I assume we'll put it up for sale.  I get most of my things out of the house, except for a vanity and a dresser that are too heavy for my friends and I to move.  I moved out the day before Halloween.  \n\nSince then, I've messaged Rick a few times to see what we're going to do about the house and to schedule a time to come pick up the rest of my furniture.  He's pretty evasive about all of it, so last Thursday I showed up at the house with some friends to help me get my stuff.  He's changed the locks, so I can't get in.  We wait for him to get off of work and come back, and he lets me in to get my stuff.  All he said before he let me in was \"You asked for this, so I don't want to hear it\".  I didn't know what he meant.\n\nI was absolutely not prepared to walk through that door, but when I did it became obvious why he didn't want me to come pick up my stuff.  I didn't even recognize the house that I lived in just a week prior.  It was painted, there was furniture and art and things everywhere, and I could tell by looking around that Rick didn't do this by himself.  There are pictures of him and some woman all over the place.  They have to go back at least a year, because one of them was taken on New Year's, though I couldn't tell what year.  \n\nI just left.  I can buy more furniture, but I couldn't spend a second more in that house.  Rick texted me right after I left saying \"we're not selling, we're just going to buy you out\".  I was at a complete loss for words.  I'm still in shock.  I spent 16 years with that asshole, and he was with someone else for who knows how long.  \n\nI'm trying to get over it the best I can, but it's hard.  It would be hard leaving just because we've been together so long, but to find out that your life was pretty much a lie was a hard pill to swallow.  What hurts even more is that for years I tried to decorate my house to make it a home and he wouldn't let me.  She couldn't have lived with him for more than a week, and the house already looks different.  \n\nI honestly don't know how I was so blind, but I'm glad I got out when I did, even if he did waste half of my life.  \n\n**tl;dr**:  I ended a 16 year relationship because my fiance is seemingly uninterested in committing to me, only to find out that he was dating someone while we were together, and they've now moved into our home together.  \n\n\n**Edit to add mini update:** I just want to thank everyone again for all of their support.  A lot of you pointed out that my name would still be on the mortgage even if I sell, so I've decided not to sign the paperwork accepting the buyout.  Rick was not okay with this, and has been blowing up my phone ever since he found out today calling me a \"petty bitch\", and that I was just trying to ruin his life because he was finally happy.  I know they're both pissed off because they put a lot of effort into the home in the short time since I've left, and honestly I kind of feel better that they won't be able to enjoy it.  I know it sounds terrible, but making this harder on them is making me feel better about the entire situation.  For the majority of our relationship, I felt like he was always the one in control of everything.  It's nice to have the final say.\n\nI know I've said a lot how he's wasted half of my life, and I'd like to clarify that I don't think I'm too old or that it's too late for me, just that I couldn't understand why this man would string someone along for as long as he did.  He's pretty much all I've known, and it took a lot for me to leave him.  I feel like I've missed out on a lot of the dating experience, but I think I'll be okay.  I'm just going to enjoy being alone for right now.\n\nSince I moved out I've been staying with a friend.  I signed a lease for a one bedroom apartment today, so by this time next week I'll have my own place.  I've already bought a bunch of things to decorate it with, and I didn't have to get anyone's permission to do so :) \n\n",

I think it will help you have a clear head if you want to get into another serious relationship about what you want and what you don't want, and what -- most importantly -- you will absolutely not tolerate.\n\nAlso, he's not allowed to change the locks or bar you from the house while your name is still on the mortgage and title. Neither can he move someone else in. If you want to be a jerk, you can insist on kicking his mistress out and having access to the house until he gets off his ass and buys you out.

So now, even if you have no interest in another intimate relationship right now (understandable and probably wise), keep your eye out for people who seem truly happy in their relationships, and notice how they interact, what their lives are like.

Do not give him credit for paying more of the mortgage. When it comes to jointly owning a home, that does not matter. He made his bed buying a home with you, make him lie in it. Do not accept anything based on the original loan amount, the house has likely appreciated and worth more than when you two bought it.

First, thank you all for your outpouring of love and support! I got on this morning and was overwhelmed by all your love, help, and compassion! You guys give me hope for humanity. And thanks to the a-hole who told me I was a crazy drama whore, that my husband should dump me and get a restraining order. \n\nSo, yesterday morning, my husband took me to the doctor's, who asked me a lot of the questions you guys did. No, I didn't hit my head recently, no I don't take recreational drugs. However, I have been feeling ill lately, so the night I had the dream/hallucinations, I had taken NyQuil and Benadryl to help me sleep and not drown in my own snot. Oh, and I also had a few hot toddies, so alcohol.\n\nApparently, Benadryl has been known to cause weird reactions in perfectly normal people. Such as vivid hallucinations or waking dreams. \n\n\n\nSo instead of scheduling expensive tests, we chalked it up to weird drug interactions, was told to come back if anything similar happened and to get a goddamn PCP. Husband took me home and I slept. Btw, while I was freaking out and still hopped up on drugs, I did check the call records, and his ex's number wasn't on the call or text list. \n\n\nEDIT: Yeah, guys, in retrospect, mixing two kinds of drugs that (apparently, never knew this, and thanks for telling me, bc I wouldn't have known) do the same thing was really damn stupid. I won't be doing it again. Also probably never taking acetaminophen either, judging from some of your comments. Or alcohol. Also, I'm actually really relived I'm not alone in the whole mind-trip thing. I'm sorry for anyone who experienced what I did and doubt their own reality. \n\n\n\n**tl;dr** NyQuil, Benadryl, and alcohol should not be mixed as Benadryl is evil. ",

            "First off, its not only stupid, but life threatening to take alcohol with such drugs. So stay off alcohol. If you can't, then don't take medications.\n\nSecondly- Nyquil + Benadryl= Twice the dosage of what you should be taking. Nyquil has Doxylamine succinate (12.5 mg/30 mL) (antihistamine/hypnotic). Benadryl has Diphenhydramine  (50 mg per tab). Both drugs, taken at a high dose, plus alcohol will definitely result in weird dreams/hallucinations/altered mental state. \n\nNext time when taking medications, read the instructions and follow them. They aren't written just for text sake, they want to make sure you don't die a easily preventable death from negligence and non-compliance.",
            "I followed your previous story and was concerned, I'm glad you're clear for now but it's not always right what a doctor says so please keep that in mind.\n\nI highly suggest you start a daily journal/diary, write in this every night before you sleep, recall every event of the day (doesn't need to be emotions, just what you did and what happened).\n\nRead this every morning of your previous day, let your husband read it as well.\n\nThe main reason is, you only caught this because you had a bad day, confronted your husband about it but what if you had a normal day, nothing weird happened, you wouldn't know would you?\n\nIt's why I suggest a journal to track yourself, make it a habit and don't take this lightly. Once it becomes a habit you may even hallucinate yourself writing in it the night before and when you go back and read it and nothing is there, you know something is up.\n\nI hope it is the drugs and alcohol and that you are completely well.",
            "My parents gave me Benedryl for a fever and it caused such realistic, vivid hallucinations that almost 30 years later I can still remember them. Some people react badly to that medicine. It was not fun and I'm so sorry you had to go through a scare.",

I gave him three benadryl and then we went to the ER, where they gave him IV benadryl.\n\nHe became very paranoid and angry with me. Remembered conversions that didn't happen, heard voices calling his name in empty rooms. Looking back now, it's quite funny. At the time, not so much.\n\nAnyway, even over the counter meds can be dangerous. Please be safe out there.",
            "That makes a lot of sense. I've read a bit about people experiencing hallucinations on benadryl. It often involves being in a familiar place interacting with friends and family, even the deceased.

Thread was locked by the time, I could see and make that comment though.\n\nAlcohol magnifies the effects of drugs in your system. seriously, don't do that.",
            "I see people talking about how doxylamine succinate and diphenhydramine, in combination with alcohol, could cause hallucinations. While that *could* be true, the main culprit is surely dextromethorphan (DXM).\n\nDXM has very strong dissociative properties. You can go on full \"trips\" similar to ketamine or PCP. Im sure you didn't take a whole bottle or anything, but coupled with the alcohol and antihistamine/hypnotics (the chemicals named above), a full dissociative \"trip\" is very possible. It's also important to note that some people are particularly vulnerable to hallucinogens.\n\nI hope that's the end of this (traumatic) experience. Sounds like you were a little rattled by the whole thing. I wouldn't risk taking DXM again, even if you didn't mix alcohol with it. If I had such a serious hallucination, I would be too scared to mess with it. I hope you learned from this and move forward.",

My wife, girlfriend at the time, got drunk on gin one time and threw a fit, and accused me of cheating on her with a receptionist I would have in the future.

The idea that nyquil, benadril, and alcohol could provoke the most vivid hallucinations I've ever heard of in my entire life is pretty ridiculous, and your doctor sounds like an ass for leaving it at this.

I have crazy dreams like that from Benadryl by itself all the time, and sometimes when I've taken nothing at all.  A tired brain can really mess with you.  In any case, try to be gentle with yourself.  You're not the first person who thought a Bena-dream was real and freaked out, and you won't be the last.  \n\n(P.S. Drink plenty water.

            "I'd also look into sleep disorders like sleep paralysis, even if it's just for your own education. You may want to check it out so you can adjust any behaviours which might be enabling this phenomenon.\n\nSleep paralysis dreams are so vivid and terrifying they can feel \"real\" for years after you wake up from them. Some people have episodes where they think someone has broken into the house, or they have been visited by aliens, while others can have dreams that people are standing outside their bedroom windows or doors having a loud conversation. A dream incorporating a strange party and your SO cheating on you is not out of the question. \n\nSP dreams feel so vivid physically because your body's fight-or-flight response is activated even though you're not capable of  moving. This causes an adrenaline surge, tachycardia, increased respiration, and sweating. It can be a terrifying event, and it can be triggered by medication interactions, sleeping in an unusual (to you) posture, and/or sleep disorders like narcolepsy or premature waking. And while most episodes last only minutes (regardless of how long the dream feels subjectively), there are people who have had episodes go on for an hour or more. ",

            "Ah so back when i was in a worse place, I tried to trip off of Benadryl. Meaning i would take upwards of 20 pills, drink and smoke. The first time I blacked out and woke up in my underwear with cuts and bruises over my body. The second time I hallucinated vividly, and i mean vividly. I was literally talking to friends who weren't there. Id be sitting in my room, looking at my friend, having a full conversation with him, I'd talk to him, he'd talk to me. After a few minutes i looked away, then looked back to where my friend was sitting, he was gone. There was never anyone there, i hallucinated the entire thing. Sober people around me at the time were really confused, they told me I'd just randomly start talking to the air next to me. So, moral of the story, be aware of what you put into your body, weird fucking things can happen. ",
            "Benadryl alone can cause hallucinations so real you can't tell them from reality. It is even classified as a deliriant and works as one in high doses or to people with sensitivities to it. People take diphenhydramine (benadryl) at high doses to trip. When you are under this effect, your pet dinosaur Maury can bust in your door warning you that your house is on fire while there is smoke pouring through and you will be like \"wait is that is that smoke a hallucination? Nah... Maury would never lie to me, better get into that time portal on my wall before I die.\" Some people are VERY sensitive to benadryl and you may be one of these people who exaggerated this reaction with alcohol and nyquil.",

I asked him about his new golf bag and he had bought it with his club credit which made me soften up a little bit.\n\nSo I sat down in the recliner across from him and started scribbling on my note pad a game plan for him/us with a budget for him and a way he can afford a car.\n\nI told him the game plan and he curtly said \"sounds good.\" Then I went out into his backyard (he lives on BEAUTIFUL farm land with a nice deck outback) since I just didn't want to deal with him. And I just sat outside and cried. He came outside and started fiddling with some stuff in his yard and didn't say a word to me.\n\nHe said \"So should I just plan on you not talking tonight?\" And then went on about how I have been such a source of disappointment for him financially.\n\nSo I didn't say a word, took the groceries and dinner I bought and told him we are done.

        "selftext": "[Link to original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/96tmu5/my_26f_coworker_found_my_boyfriend_27m_on_tinder/)\n\nMy (26F) last post didn't get too much attention, but I figured I would update as 1.) it's cathartic and 2.) things got pretty intense. Essentially, if you didn't read the last post, my coworker's housemate spotted my boyfriend (27M) on Tinder. He said he didn't use it. Which was clearly a lie, as many of you stated.\n\nI truly wanted to believe him when I made the post, even though my gut (and the evidence really) told me not to. So I made a fake profile with one picture and no bio and searched for him with no luck, I matched people to keep the algorithm working but didn't send messages. I left it at that for the time-being.\n\nI saw my boyfriend last weekend and I still didn't get an explanation. Or an apology. Or anything even near the truth. So I decided to snoop (edit: through his messages). I'm not proud and I owned up to it, partially because he had some weird exchanges with girls. This isn't important to the story, but when I confronted him, I got half-assed responses and we continued to hardly speak throughout this week. He also is currently at a festival this weekend, so I was still feeling even more insecure. I had no explanation for TWO possible cheating situations now. I was a bit tipsy last night and decided to bring up the old fake profile, setting the distance on maximum to pick up the festival location. And what do you know, he appeared.\n\nI was too afraid to match him so I messaged my coworker's housemate. She stopped by my job the other day to introduce herself and apologise for the whole situation. Apparently her ex-boyfriend also had a tinder profile and that's why she ended things with him -- she said she had my back and would keep an eye out for me. I thought she wouldn't find him when I told her, as I was under the impression that profiles disappear after you swipe left. However, she found him and they matched.\n\nI texted my boyfriend immediately saying it was over because he's still on Tinder and here's where it gets insane. He responded that his best mate has apparently been chatting on Tinder with a girl from my country and living in my current city. My coworker's housemate is from my country, which is super rare. It honestly wouldn't surprise me that she would get on with my boyfriend's best mate. I know she has friends that live in his town and is there from time to time, because she said that's why his profile came up straight straight away. Anyway -- when my boyfriend's mate went on about her, he thought I was being a catfish so apparently he decided to download Tinder at the festival to try to catch me. Honestly, I can sort of see why he'd think that in a roundabout way because we're very similar. Still, I told him that his accusation and excuse for being on Tinder was ridiculous, although I owned up to making a fake profile to try to find him. I also said I know the girl who was chatting his mate, because she's the one that found him originally and matched with again him today.\n\nI then reiterated that we were through because there is obviously zero trust between the two of us. I don't think I was right in snooping and making a fake profile, but I felt as if I deserved the truth. I also asked if I needed to go to the GUM clinic, even though I'll go anyways. He said he would respond tomorrow, but it's well into the afternoon and nothing. Closure is overrated, I guess. I'm pretty numb to the whole situation, although I'm gutted that I'll lose our mutual friends because I'll be the crazy ex who catfished their mate.\n\n\u200b\n\ntl;dr -- My now-ex-boyfriend 'wasn't on tinder' but I caught him on it at a festival. Instead of owning up to it, he accuses me of catfishing his best mate. Our relationship is over.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b",

            "Don't buy his bullshit. He was cheating and refused to own up to it. You should absolutely go to the clinic. Jesus Christ, \"I'll tell you tomorrow\" is not an appropriate answer to a question like that. What an ass. Be glad he's out of your life.",
            "Don't feel ashamed about following through on your suspicions, and don't just assume your mutual friends will choose him. \nKeep showing up, maintain connections, and let him deal with the discomfort of knowing that you are still around. You aren't in the wrong here.",
            "What an idiot.  I don't condone cheating in any way shape or form, but if you're going to do it, why would you do it on a mainstream platform where you can be found by just about anyone!?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat a moron.  Good riddance.",
            "I don't see why you'll lose your friends. Tell them the truth and dismiss his friend's profile as irrelevant to the situation. Say that he's been active on tinder throughout your relationship and you don't know what his friend has to do with anything because that girl is real and this is between you and your ex, not his friend.",
            "I know everyone is super against snooping but to be honest when you have a really good reason i feel its 100% justified. I'm for protecting my sexual health if my partner is acting shady.\n\nNow if you were snooping because of jealousy and immaturity and unable to trust with very little reason then i would be judging. But it truely needs to be out there that people shouldn't protect cheaters because they think snooping is wrong in any context. Its a big shrug for me and maybe against popular opinion",
            "Any \"friend\" that doesn't even bother asking for your side isn't a friend at all. Good riddance. \n\nIt sucks now, but things will improve and you'll be far better for it. ",
            "I'm glad you're leaving. Like you said, there's no trust here, what's the point? Also the whole thing about the best mate and all that sounded like total bullshit, as an unbiased observer. Best to just let the ladies of Tinder have him and move on.",
            "Just a tip for future boyfriends (since you're now concerned about how your actions for this one appear to others).\n\nIf they're acting suspiciously, so you snoop, and then catch them doing something that's a dealbreaker?\n\nYou don't have to give them the real reason you're breaking up with them.\n\nYou don't have to give them any reason at all.\n\nYou can just say \"I'm breaking up with you\" and tell everyone else that you weren't compatible in the long term.\n\nWhen you find out something like you did, it might seem like it would be more satisfying to have a big confrontation scene. Hell, maybe there's even a genuine explanation that you should hear.\n\nBut, as you found out this time, it's usually not worth it.\n\nMost people will deny any wrongdoing, and they might try to turn things back on you. \n\nSo if you've already got the evidence?

            "Gurl. Tough love time. \n\nReading this is exhausting. You and your ex are both too old (aka should be too mature) to be running around creating fake profiles to catch each other cheating. Cut ties, move on and find yourself a man who doesn't act (and make you act) like a 16 year old. You deserve better. ",
            "> I don't think I was right in snooping and making a fake profile\n\nThat's not snooping. That's laying bait. If you dug through his stuff, that would be snooping. Both can be huge trust violations. But you had reasonable suspicion warranting laying bait. Laying bait also was less invasive than snooping. Honestly, it seems like you had reason to do both.\n\n> Anyway -- when my boyfriend's mate went on about her, he thought immediately thought I was being a catfish so apparently he decided to download Tinder at the festival to try to catch me.\n\nBullshit. And what about the other times he was on it? Also, if he was trying to 'catch you,' how did he not end up matching with you and messaging you? \n\n**Why would he use his own profile picture of himself to catch you?** That makes no fucking sense at all. He would make a fake profile, *especially* because he's not still using his actual one to try to hook up with other girls, right?\n\nAlso, why wouldn't he just ask to see how the chat was going on his friend's Tinder account, looking for verbal tics that mean it would be you catfishing the friend? How the hell does he think he would catch you by finding the catfish profile? Would he chat with you and hope you were dumb enough to respond *as the catfish*? That makes zero sense. None.\n\nI could be missing something; I don't use Tinder. But this just reeks of bullshit on his part. Lame bullshit.",

That's when she told me. So I ended up meeting up with him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, not my proudest moment. But like you, I just wanted the truth. The whole time I was calm and reasonable. I told him what I knew and that I just wanted the truth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, he basically decided to be very wishy washy with his responses. Said that someone was impersonating him online (then how did he know to meet up with this fictitious person?). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I made the same choice as you. To walk way. And I have no regrets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so sorry you had to go through this! But it's kind of a mixed blessing. Yes this sucks, but at least you know now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou knew before things got even more serious (ie. marriage).
