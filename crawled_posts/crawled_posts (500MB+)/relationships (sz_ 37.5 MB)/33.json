It wasn't as swift as some comments encouraged... we reconciled after he insisted he hadn\u2019t meant to end things and had overreacted out of emotion. We gave it another shot living in our own places again for a few weeks. Things went well enough, but unresolved trust issues became exacerbated as I was not in his physical proximity as often and he felt insecure about the distance between us. \n\nUltimately, a few weeks after reconciling we ended up in another argument after dinner one night. There was once again a very disproportionate reaction to a situation that should have been more calmly communicated about, and I realized if we reconciled again I'd be in the same position a few weeks later... it had become an exhausting cycle.\n\nWe aren't in contact this time. He found the original thread I posted and was (understandably) hurt by what I wrote and for not sticking up for him. I am sad, mourning ending the relationship, and feeling bad for hurting someone I care about. Frustrated that it was so messy, that it didn't work out, etc... just taking things a day at a time and trusting that I made the right choice (which is hard when there's no answer key for life to check against.)

            "The thing that stood out in the original post is that he complained when you were upstairs, then complained when you came down to hang out. \n\nThere is no winning with people like that. No matter what you do they will find fault and keep you in a perpetual state of contrition to them. It's controlling and meant to leave the other person exhausted trying to make up for perceived wrong-doings.  And you can never make things right because expectations shift and often contradict previous demands. \n\nTrust you made the right decision.",
            "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re sad now, but I can assure you it will pass. You\u2019ve made the right decision, and it doesn\u2019t mean that either of you are bad people, just not compatible.\n\nAs for the 30s, it\u2019s actually super weird but all of my closest female friends, including my sister, found their amazing partners in their early thirties. After struggling with douchebags/ people who are not the best for them/cheating FIANC\u00c9S in their twenties. I think it\u2019s something to do with finding your own comfort zone, accepting yourself finally, communicating your needs/boundaries and in general less fucks given about other people and their opinions. I wish you luck and honestly I\u2019ve no doubt you\u2019ll find a great partner as just as I\u2019ve said, 30s is where it\u2019s at!",

            "First, you are better off without him.\n\nLove after 30. My best friend has had a string of serious boyfriends but recently she (at 34) got together with a friend of hers from college and she got pregnant on the first time they were together. She opted for aborting and he came with her to the appointment and they had a little ceremony where they read out something to the fetus and said goodbye to it. Both of their jobs lead to travel, but they always make time to call and text with each other and she made certain when they were first together to make sure that his priorities are in line with hers. They're planning to officially move in once the first person's lease is up for renewal and starting a family soon. \n\nMy husband's aunt didn't meet her husband until 36, married at 37 and had her kids at 38 and 40. Those kids are now in their mid-late 20s and getting married themselves. \n\nMy friend K got married in his late 20s but it didn't work out and he was divorced with a young son by his early 30s. He and my friend S ended up falling in love and getting married about two years ago. His ex is also remarrying soon.",
            "I ended a 13-year relationship at age 30 and I was utterly convinced I'd die alone - but I'd rather live and die alone than with my ex by my side. Without even trying I met my current boyfriend not even 6 months later and we've been together for 6 years.\n\nI think the secret is to take some time to reflect on your life and just go out and have fun with no expectations. Don't put pressure on yourself to find someone, take a breath and do enjoy life. Don't settle out of fear or pressure (or God forbid you get back together with him), you'll regret it. You've been just given a fantastic opportunity to restart your life and truly be happy, this is the time to do all the things and more!!",

I truly believe if you focus on loving YOU first, a healthy romantic relationship will follow when you\u2019re ready.",
            "Ending a relationship always hurts because you don't stop caring about someone just because you've realised that dating them isn't right for you. But the world isn't black and white and you're right, there's no answer sheet. Ultimately all that matters is that you're happy. And I think you know that you wouldn't be happy if you'd stayed with him, or else you wouldn't have been able to bring yourself to break up. \n\nYou might feel crappy now, because your lifestyle and future plans have become uncertain, but please look at this as a chance to start over and fulfil your own needs and desires! Take some time being single, build yourself back up, and then start again with a partner much more suited to you, one you'd never have met if not for this break up. \n\nBe grateful to your ex for showing you what you don't need or want, and don't be afraid to put your foot down about these qualities in future relationships. You're still young! Definitely young enough to find love but old enough to know what you want and to not settle.\n\nGood luck!",
            ">  I\u2019m feeling frustrated that I attempted to handle this in a productive and proactive way and somehow screwed up. \n\nYou are internalizing this way too much. **You didn't screw up.** You can't control his reactions. He behaves according to his nature, and there is no magical combination of words and actions that would change that. When someone tells you who they are, believe them the first time!",

            "I\u2019ve been seeing a therapist, and after processing a bad breakup, I said to her recently \u201cI\u2019m done hurting myself to make him feel better.\u201d \n\nYou had a need to be alone, and he wasn\u2019t willing to respect that. It\u2019s good you were able to see the pattern of exhausting arguments. Why should you have to minimize or disregard your personal needs to appease him? Of course, a relationship will have times of giving and taking but it sounds like you were doing all the giving and he was doing all of the taking. \n\nThere\u2019s no time limit or deadline for you to find a relationship, you\u2019re not too old at 30. It\u2019s so cliche but for me, putting in the work on myself, loving myself, finding out what I truly love and enjoy, finding out more about my personality and quirks and attachment style, pouring into new hobbies, all of that has been incredibly healing to me. You can be sad and grieve the loss of the relationship and also be happy and optimistic for a better fit in the future.",

She stopped looking and figured she liked her life, she liked her career, she was cool being single and that was that. Then a couple years later met a friend of a friend and they've been joined at the hip ever since. He's amazing and we all love him. They're talking about a fabulous destination wedding when covid is over. I can't wait. He's a great guy and he's so good to her (and her elderly father). She had a good life before and he just enriches it.\n\nYou shouldn't have to deal with so many compromises. Relationships are work, but they shouldn't be as hard as yours was. When I started dating my now-husband, I couldn't believe how ... easy it was. It just worked and we make each other's lives easier. Not harder and more frustrating. And he'd never make me cry over a mattress.",

She has (had?) a difficult relationship with food, and underlying issues. She felt like her life was not starting off the way she wanted it to for a long time. She went to a pretty intense, long therapy program. After about 6 months, she started to feel better. After another 6 months, she fell in love with another guy in the program. They moved in together last winter. She is 31 (I think) now, and they moved quite quickly. The advantage of being a bit not-20-anymore is that you know what you want. It's great!",

I\u2019m almost 33 now. \n\nOne of the most delightful moments in our relationship was when I was musing on June being a really great month. It has my birthday *and* our anniversary! That\u2019s when I realized that his dating profile had 30 as the lower bound for his age range \u2014 we fell in love as soon as we met, but OKC only showed him my profile once I aged in. \n\nHe did not find this as amusing as I did.",

            "I (m34) was in a similar cycle with my 6-year ex (f30), until, the fourth time we went \"on a break\", I called the whole thing off, started looking for my own place. I was trying not to seriously date anyone for a while, my sister had just passed (its her birthday today, happy birthday, Lily) and I wasnt sure my brain could be trusted. I met the most amazing woman (f35) I could have conceived of. We are now happily codependent and joining our lives together. \n\nThe really amazing thing about dating in your thirties, i found, is you have a much, MUCH, better idea of what you want, what you need and what you need to avoid. Is seven months too soon to move in? Maybe, I don't really care. Haven't thought about my ex in months. \n\nAlso, you didn't hurt your ex, from what I've read. Your perspective of his actions challenged his sense of self. A year or two into my last relationship, I did find it hurtful that she would always talk through our problems with others before she came to me with them. But by the end? I would have expected her to take desperate means, such as airing our dirty laundry on reddit, if i thought she actually wanted to fix things. Oh, and slutting around between relationships is fun, but not required, despite what sitcoms may have led you to believe.

            "You seem like an articulate, intelligent person.  As hard as this break up is, it's near impossible to end any relationship on perfect terms , so try not to think about the mess. Maybe in a few months or however long, you guys may be able to contact eachother as friends /acquaintances and tie up any loose ends ... Or maybe you'll find in yourself that it's best left to rest .  The latter is probably the best option in my honest opinion.  Your (ex) partner sounds a lot less mature than as you come across.  He shouldn't have been angry about finding your last thread either. You simply reached out for help and didn't paint him in a bad light at all. It was just very clear that he was in the wrong and he got embarrassed. You didn't hurt him , he hurt himself.  \n\nWell done for recognising the pattern and ending things btw.  You seem as if you have a vested interest in self-preservation .  A lot of people (me included) probably would have tolerated this kind of behaviour, forgiven him/ let him have his way and suffered the consequences until we physically couldn't take it anymore .",

He says he started crushing on me pretty much the moment he laid eyes on me, and he asked me to dance. We have been killin it ever since. \n\nOne great thing about dating after 30, at least dating someone emotionally mature after 30, is that there is no bullshit. We knew each others\u2019 stance on marriage and kids before we even got out of the hookup zone.

But B thinks I\u2019m the hottest person he\u2019s ever been with no matter the age, and I think the same of him. And since we were already both whole, competent adults when we met, it\u2019s been so easy to build a life together. I'm still afraid we may end up having age-related complications when we get to the point that we're trying to start a family.

Your need to have quiet time or quiet when you work doesn't suit him.  He could have worn headphones.\n\nWhen you needed to go home for a day he took that as a rejection too and so rejected you harder by telling you not to come back.\n\nI don't know why he's like that; maybe how he grew up.

            "I dont have a \"love after 30\" but i do have a story that involves me almost marrying someone and that ending. I was engaged to someone for 2-3 years. We lived together all during that time. He was an awful person and when he needed his space he would send me back home for a week or 2, then id figure out that was his way of breaking up with me. We'd talk and then he'd pick me up to go back to our (he called it his house even though we bought it together) house. Literally it was horrible and i thought i really loved him. (A lot more went on that was abusive) I was extremely depressed when i finally ended things. I couldnt take it, it took an extreme toll on my mental health. (that part of my life feels like a whole past life). Years go by and i have the worst luck with love. I literally gave up. I was sick of relationships and i only wanted to be with myself. I get hired at starbucks and the guy who used to stare at me in the grocery store but could never say hi, and used to turn around to talk to me in high school.. was there working at my new store. We would check the schedule to see when we would work together (we did this without the other knowing) and he asked me out when we finally did work together. We have been together ever since. Literally he kept asking me out every single day because he missed me, and i missed him so much that id agree. We both found out too that we've always liked eachother but nothing came of it until last year. He even screenshotted when i followed him on instagram a few years ago. We both thought the other was too good. This is the healthiest realtionship o have ever been in. And i thank god every day for him. There is always hope for love and I someone who gave up on it and was completely destroyed by it, found someone who makes me forget all that.

Here we are (nearly) 3 years later!",

He listened to everything I said, I listened to everything he said. He never once blamed me and said we have to talk to each other otherwise will erode the foundations we're building with each other.   \n\n\nI promise you there is hope. Good men are out there and you can find love at any age.   \n\n\nMy other friend met her now boyfriend after a horrible abusive relationship/marriage in her early 20's. She is now 60 and been with her partner for 4 years and counting. I have never seen her happier and he is a wonderful man with two grown sons she loves (she never had kids).

            "I was married for 10 years, three kids in with a classic narcissist. We split when I caught him cheating....again. Jumped into a horrible rebound relationship that I pretended was good for me. Another two years wasted and I just turned 31. I had pretty much given up, was trying to get content with meaningless dating a few weeks at a time then starting over. Then out of nowhere I met a man who was exactly what I wanted, what I needed. We dated, he was freshly divorced and still scared of his ex wife presiding over his life, we were madly in love and were moving super fast. We dated for two and a half months and it was bliss, until he went to a counseling session with his son and the counselor pretty much told him he was wrong for being in a happy relationship so quickly and he should break up with me and focus on his kids. Sooooo he broke up with me a week before Halloween. It wasn\u2019t a typical breakup, we still talked every day and reassured each other it would all be ok, deep down we knew what we wanted and I was dead set in seeing this thing through. We slowly start dating again but don\u2019t put any labels on it, we go on a weekend getaway in December and see each other on Christmas. He stays at my house when he doesn\u2019t have his kids (50/50). His birthday comes around in January and he goes into a depression because his ex wife left him on his birthday and she was also talking about moving their kids three states away and he was worried, he breaks up with me again. I am heartbroken but I try to understand where he is coming from and try to give him space. I spend the weekend at home with my kids pretending I\u2019m ok and he goes to his best friends a few hours away with his kids. He comes back home and calls me to check in, decides to come over to talk and we decide to stop letting fear get in the way of happiness. We decide to get married and start planning a wedding.He moves in permanently and we set the house up to accommodate 6 kids. We take the kids on an awesome spring break, go on our first out of stare adult vacation, his first plane trip. We ended up ditching the big wedding and eloped in June, went on a Bahamas cruise in July for our honeymoon and my birthday. We started looking at buying a house in July but got denied because of credit, we thought it would take 1 or 2 years to clean it up and qualify but we closed on our dream home in a gated community December 23. Kids had no clue, they thought we were just looking for a bigger rental, we got to surprise them all on Christmas Eve with our brand new home. We can\u2019t have anymore babies so we got our first puppy on Memorial Day and our one year anniversary is this Saturday and we are taking the little on a weekend road trip to the beach and to see his best friend. From given up to living out my dream life with my dream man in less than two years. Don\u2019t give up, listen to your gut, not your heart, your gut.",
            "I met my husband at 34. Married at 35. Had a baby at 36 and then again at 38. Just turned 40. \n\nWhat's nice about dating in your 30s is that you're settled into who you are, you know what you want in life, and when you find someone compatible, things can move quickly.\n\nWe got engaged after 10 months of dating and married 6 months after that. \n\nI was able to travel, be independent, buy a house, meet people. It was great. You'll be great too.",
            "Read both, agree it was for the best. Take it as a learning experience, and you know what's more compatible for a future partner. He'll learn the same. Don't end it on hate though, and hopefully months down the road you two can be friends that grab coffee once or twice a year or something like that lol.",
            "I like to think that people become more critical thinkers, in their late 20\u2019s and early 30\u2019s. \n\nI was in a horrendous relationship with my ex, for over 7 years. Right after my 27th bday, I knew it was over. The physical, mental, sexual abuse was just way too much on me. As I imagine it would be on anyone. \n\nI wasn\u2019t necessarily looking for anyone else at the time, but I just needed an escape plan. I realized that I was in my late 20\u2019s, and it was time to stop fucking around, so to speak. I met my bf I am with now, and I never looked back. \n\nI\u2019ll be 30 in two months, and being with my bf, is the smartest decision I\u2019ve ever made. He makes me the happiest I\u2019ve ever been, and treats me the way I deserve to be treated. Finding love after a tumultuous relationship is very possible.",
            "My husband was 31 when we met. He had loved and lost or whatever many times. He told me if it hadn't have worked out between us he didn't ever want to date another person.

I think this is best you probably are both great people but sometimes great people aren't meant to be great together",
            "So I also had my share of ups and downs in my 20's. Became a single mom at 24, and mostly had just stopped looking by the time I was 30. I had a friend whose mom was supposedly psychic tell me that I would meet my husband within a year, and we would have a daughter. Riiiiiight......\nSo anyway one weekend I was out with some friends and I saw this guy, he was cute and very muscular--i mimicked the SNL skit Hans and Frans to my friend, kinda making fun of him. To make a long story short we were engaged 3 weeks later, my son gave him permission to marry me, we married 2 months later and I found out just before the wedding that I was expecting. Needless to say, it was a girl, and we've been married for over 17 years now.",

            "Hey there. Just wanna say I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re suffering but I would like to think everything happens for a reason.  Two months ago I (26F) ended my 7 year relationship.  We were similar in that we would reconcile, then something disastrous would happen then reconcile again. I finally realized that I was unhappy and didn\u2019t want to be on this same path 5 years down the road but now trapped in an unhappy marriage and with kids brought into it. So I left. It\u2019s been hard, he was my best friend. I would be lying if I didn\u2019t say I was lonely as fuck pretty often. But I\u2019m also proud of myself for sticking it out and not being codependent and I hope you can get to that point too.  I\u2019m starting nursing school in the fall and realistically won\u2019t be done for 2-3 years so I will be 29-30 when I am finished.  The odds of me finding my dream guy in that time are slim. So I\u2019ll be right there with ya. But I think 30\u2019s are beautiful and it\u2019s never too late to find someone. Best of luck dear!",
            "I didn't see your first post, but if I had I would have told you that that would have been immediate means to break up and leave it broken. I dated a guy and we spent time together every day, all day, until one of us went to bed, which is honestly never healthy. It also wasn't something I enjoyed. Maybe for the first few weeks, but after that, it was time for life. I asked him if I could just spend a few hours to myself every day and you know what he did? He accused me of cheating, lol. Because I wanted a few hours to myself. I'm the type of person who needs time to recharge from things and the fact that the first thing he went to was cheating was a red flag, for me. Later on, he told me he had been cheated on, so he was suspicious of someone wanting time to themselves. I knew that wasn't going to work for me. Like you, we tried to reconcile, but it really just got worse. Now, when I was having my \"alone time\", he'd text me and ask me to send a picture or call him, so I could confirm I was where I said I was. I ended it again because I wasn't planning to spend my life either having to be tethered to him every day or having to prove I wasn't cheating.\n\nYour ex overreacted and it's proof that he would overreact a lot, so you are smart to realize it was going to become a pattern and just left it alone. Unfortunately, I have no love-after-30 stories because I'm focusing on me and not really worried about love right now. Maybe not ever because, while other areas of my life may not be great, I'm happier than I was in my last two relationships, anyway, and I'd like to keep it that way. I'm finally really coming into my own and, unless someone is truly going to add to my life, I'm not interested. That's probably one of the best things about turning 30; you're less likely to put up with crap, but that also means you're more likely to find someone better for you.",

If I'd still be hanging on to the toxic relationship, I'd have missed the love of my life.\n\nIf you're caught up in something that makes you unhappy, it's likely you'll be too busy to see what brings you happiness.\n\nHope you feel better soon xx",

            "(Nearly) after 30 love story: I didn\u2019t start dating, period, until I was 24 and I didn\u2019t start dating my now-husband until I was 29. He had just gotten out of a toxic relationship. I had recently ended my FWB status with an ex-bf. As I knew I wanted marriage, we talked about all the important things - kids, careers, life plans - within the first month (no sense wasting time when I knew what I wanted). It didn\u2019t scare him away. He lived in St. Louis and I lived in NY. I moved halfway across the county to live with him because it made more sense financially and in terms of where we were with our careers. We then moved in with my parents when we moved back to NY. We got married at 31. We bought our house last year. We had a COVID-19 celebration of our third wedding anniversary last month.\n\nIn living together, we figured out how we work together as a couple, how we fight as a couple, and how we make up as a couple. Our last big fight was a little before the wedding. We have disagreed on things since, but we literally have not fought again. Even when we did, our commitment is that we will always work it out, so we knew it would end up okay, even in the midst of screaming and crying. I think that since we\u2019ve had that commitment since the beginning, it\u2019s become so ingrained that really, why fight anymore? We present our opposing sides and compromise since we both know how we want it to end. I adore him, and he shows me his love everyday. Sometimes he\u2019ll fall asleep on the couch at night while I\u2019m on my phone or laptop and he\u2019ll just hug my legs as he sleeps. These little things make me love him more.",

And it's not constant work to be together, because we value a similar lifestyle and also because I'm not always monitoring my own choices and behavior to avoid setting him off. Also my husband is much hotter than the ex ;) . Love after 30 is grand. But so was the year in between that I spent single!

I had a lot to think about and consider.\n\nTwo days before Thanksgiving I decided to ask my mom if she knew what was going on with my sister. She told me that she just found out from the kids that my sister and her husband took off to another state for a last-minute vacation, without the kids. She didn\u2019t tell anyone and left her kids pretty much alone. My parents live nearby and would have been happy to have them over. Apparently, my sister\u2019s mother in law lives on the property in an RV with no electricity. Mother in law has schizophrenia and does not take her meds. I didn\u2019t mention in my original post, but the kids are 16M and 15F, the older kid does not have a driver\u2019s license. They also live out in the woods, a good distance from the closest town. At this point, I had decided not to invite her over. \n\nThe day before Thanksgiving, my dad called and told me that he believed my sister was under the impression that she was coming to my house with her family, even though I haven\u2019t spoken to her. I told him that her husband was not welcome, and he said I needed to tell her because he didn\u2019t want to stir up trouble. I didn\u2019t want to call her because she was alone in another state with her husband and I didn\u2019t want that to start a fight. My dad took it upon himself to call her and ask her directly what her plans were for Thanksgiving. She said she was coming to my house and he told her to call me first because there are issues. She never called me and told my mom later that night that she wasn\u2019t coming home until after Thanksgiving. My mom invited both kids to my house for Thanksgiving.\n\nMy nephew decided to go to his cousins (on his dad\u2019s side), where there is absolutely no supervision. My sister and husband are apparently okay with this. Thankfully, my mom was able to get my niece to come with them to my house. I took the opportunity to spend some time alone with her. She opened up about her problems at home and asked for a lot of advice about college, jobs, etc. I told her she is always welcome in my home and invited her to spend some time with us on her Christmas break. I gave her my number and told her to text me anytime, especially if she needs a break from her home. I don\u2019t know if she will take me up on my offer, but it\u2019s there. \n\nI\u2019m pretty disappointed that my sister would leave her kids on Thanksgiving. Her daughter was hurt by this, but now she knows there is someone that will support her and be there if she needs it. All in all, we had an awesome, drama free Thanksgiving.  \n\nTL;DR: Did not invite my sister to Thanksgiving because of her abusive husband, but was able to give my niece a lifeline which might make all the difference.

            "Is there a chance your sister could be being held against her will on this vacation?",
            "I\u2019ve been in a terribly abusive relationship. \n\n\nFirst, until you know otherwise you should assume your sister was not given a choice about the vacation away. In all likelihood he decided for her and going against him was not safe. \n\n\nYou should also know that it takes an abused partner something like 9 tries on average before leaving sticks. Leaving is the most dangerous time for an abused partner. Even when the abuse isn\u2019t physical, while leaving the possibility of *dying* is very real. And in these situations the abuser often doesn\u2019t just kill the partner, but the kids and/or family trying to help. Your sister needs to go to a domestic violence shelter where they will hide her and help her in all the ways your family is trying to help too. They will help with resume, child/spousal support, going to court, therapy for her and her kids, getting her own place or relocating her if that\u2019s necessary, etc. \n\n\nWhen she leaves she puts your parents in danger by staying with them. She doesn\u2019t mean to, and it\u2019s entirely understandable why she would want to go to them but she really needs to go to a dv shelter for all their safety. \n\n\nWhen I was leaving an ex-boyfriend who was a federal law enforcement officer, shelters across the country helped me relocate to a safe state one by one until I was about 3,000 miles away. Me and each shelter worked together to find the next shelter until I got far enough away. It was terrifying knowing that he had the reach to find me nearly anywhere. But it was also empowering to get away and start a life without him. It\u2019s been like 10 years now and I\u2019m in a much better place but not without repeating my mistakes until I figured myself out. \n\n\n",
            "I was in an abusive relationship myself, but what came to mind & God I hope im wrong. Be careful the reason he left the kids & they just went on vacation is he may try to hurt her out there. It's sad, but it's e the reality & how u must think.  I hope shes ok ",
            "Damn, read your original post.\nGlad you are reaching out to their kids. It's sad as hell that your sister is trapped in that cycle of abuse, and it'll only end if he goes to jail, or one of them dies, most likely your sister at his hands.\nSo, you can either get super involved, which will probably require someone beating the shit out of this guy, or wash your hands of it, and wait until you get the call that he finally beat her to death.\nThis situation is way bigger than a Thanksgiving dinner. Tough situation I wouldn't wish on anybody, but that's the reality. ",
            "Everything about this story is so heartbreaking, and I hope that your sister is able to get away from her husband eventually. Good for you both for not tolerating his abusive behavior and presence, and EXTRA good for you for reaching out to your niece. \n\nIt\u2019s so hard to watch the people we love cycle through these destructive patterns. All we can do is be there when they\u2019re truly ready. Best of luck with the rest of the holidays.",
            "Thanks for thinking to update here",
            "I agree with the other post about calling CPS. The man is an abuser and he and your sister are neglecting them by just leaving them like that. Maybe she was manipulated into it, maybe she wasn\u2019t. In either case, the kids deserve better.",

            "I'm glad there was an update. I'm so worried for your niece and nephew. ",
            "I think it might be a good idea to start keeping documentation of this kind of stuff- printing out multiple copies of text messages etc. In case you need to get your niece and nephew out of this situation, call CPS, or take the husband to court. Do it on the DL of course. Not sure what state you\u2019re in, but what your sister and her husband did might legally fall under child neglect-15 and 16 year olds can be left alone for a night or two but not for a full week alone in the woods without anyone to stop by and check up on them regularly...and you know...were they left with enough food and money? As they cant drive, imagine what could\u2019ve happened if one of them had been badly injured somehow. Perhaps even worse, is leaving an unmedicated elderly schizophrenic woman alone without a care giver or an adult guardian. She\u2019s a victim of this abuse too...and I know that schizophrenia sounds scary and it\u2019s grossly misrepresented in media- but schizophrenics are actually much more likely to a victim of a violent crime than a perpetrator. This woman is incredibly vulnerable, and, seeing as she is unmedicated and I\u2019m assuming she has difficulty with day to day functioning from your post, she needs to be in a home or in the care of an in-home nurse. God fuck this scumbag. \n\nYour doing the right thing by focusing on the kids.  Your sister is in denial of the true horror of this situation right now. Hopefully she\u2019ll come around for real, but there\u2019s nothing you can do to force this change. What you can do is have these kids backs, protect them, and be ready to step in and pull them out of that situation if the time ever comes. ",
            "I\u2019ve just read both of your posts, it\u2019s so similar to my sister in law it\u2019s unreal.\n\nShe\u2019s my boyfriends sister - her husband is vile, we\u2019ve had so many problems the last few years, she\u2019s left then gone back then left then gone back so many times. Then the police were involved and so was a restraining order, but she went back yet again. We\u2019re at the point now where we don\u2019t ever see him. She goes to their parents house with the kids - which sadly means that\u2019s the only place we ever see her. I don\u2019t know what will happen when eventually his parents pass away.\n\nThis is probably not much help to your situation, but just saying I can relate. It\u2019s ok to get to a place where you only see her, as much as it\u2019s limiting and it sucks. You sound like you\u2019re doing great with your niece, I know I\u2019ll try to do the same with our nieces and nephews when they\u2019re older. \n\nBest of luck to you and your family, it\u2019s horrible to  witness \u2764\ufe0f",

            "YOU ARE A GREAT PERSON. keep loving these kids even when it's hard. it won't get easier, but they obviously need you in their lives. You can only give as much as they accept from you, so keep you generosity permission based. but you can change a loved ones life with a little bit of love at the right time. You are giving these kids a fighting chance just by offering time. keep doing it. even if they have poor coping skills and can't tell you how much it means till they are older. Thank you. Someone like you saved me too. ",
            "I hate to say this but I'd be looking into this deeper. Your sister is in an abusive relationship and isn't in her right mind. It's very hard to leave when you're under the thumb of an abuser. Have you thought of getting you sister in therapy? I also worry her kids aren't safe. Teenagers or not. They've seen this happen most of their lives. Are they truly okay? Have your sisters back and collect all evidence of any abuse he shows. This will help her in the future because this does not end here.",
            "I absolutely understand your disappointment that she left her kids, but please remember that she is being brainwashed and manipulated by her abusive husband. On average it takes a person 6 tries to leave their abuser, seeing them go back time after time is painful, but try to keep contact with her as her abuser probably wants to isolate her from you guys because your love is getting in the way of his manipulation. If he can isolate her it\u2019s much easier to control her and much much harder for her to leave. Keeping contact with the children is also very good! They\u2019re also victims of the abuse. ",
            "Try to find some type of domestic violence support group in your area and get that info (discreetly) to your sister. She's making shitty choices right now, but 20 years of abuse can really grind you down. 1\u2212800\u2212799\u22127233 - National Domestic Violence Hotline.  Beyond that, there's not.much you can do - she's an adult that makes her own choices. Do try to be their for her kids. ",
            "You seem like a really great person. In the original post you wrote about your sister getting back with her husband after all he did to her. But instead of completely cutting her off, you let her know you are always there. It takes a lot to be able to do that given the circumstances. Also love that you got some alone time with your niece and were able to tell her that you are there for her and she is always welcome.Sorry you and your family have to go through this, especially your niece and her brother. At least they know they always have you. you are a great aunt and sister! ",
            "I didn't invite my sister yet she showed up anyway and took a couple of plates for her shit bag boyfriend. She's miserable already or I would have stopped her.",
            "I think your sister not leaving her abusive husband mostly stems from financial issues and her kids\u2019 wellbeing because her husband controls all the money and if she were to leave him she would need full custody and it\u2019ll be difficult to be a single mom of two without a steady income.  The thing about emotional abuse is the victim starts to believe their abusers and they feel so hopeless that they think they have no other option than to stay. \n\nThe trip was probably her husbands idea that she agreed to join because he convinced her it\u2019ll \u201cfix\u201d their marriage and she would do anything to do that or maybe she\u2019s afraid he would get violent with the kids if they went along. He sounds very desperate to make her stay and she probably senses that instability and is afraid that if she were to leave now it will escalate into attempted murder. It\u2019s just hard to predict with domestic violence, so it\u2019s very risky to leave without a solid plan and a safe space. \n\nEither way she needs support because it\u2019s impossible to leave without it and that\u2019s why abusers love isolating their victims. You should  maybe try asking why exactly she stayed (in a non accusing or judging way) and what her concerns are if she left to find out what is stopping her. \n\nEvery time she almost leaves it seems to stem from her having a potential job offer so I think finance is the main thing keeping her from leaving. Her husband probably convinced her that she can\u2019t leave without hurting the kids or suffering even more. He might\u2019ve told her he will get full custody because he controls all the money and will lie on the stands like he did when he accused her of abuse to hurt her chances of getting a job. Before she can leave she needs to know that she will have a job, a place to stay, will get full custody and her husband won\u2019t hurt her or her kids after she leaves. Right now she probably thinks none of those are possible and the only way to convince her otherwise is counter these doubts and negativity that her husband put in her head. \n\nYou\u2019re a great sister, some people would have been frustrated and left her alone and isolate her further.  I hope she\u2019ll find the resources and strength to leave him.  Leaving an abusive relationship is difficult especially as a mother and she definitely already blames herself so please try not to shame her for not leaving no matter how ridiculous you think she\u2019s being because I know that\u2019s what most people do and it just makes them feel worse.  Domestic violence is a very complex thing and emotional abuse is something that victims have a trouble noticing until they\u2019re in too deep, but at least she recognizes she needs to leave which is already a huge step.  Fuck your bother in law, I hope your sister finds peace one day. ",
            "I'm so glad you updated. Do your best to help the kids however you can, that's all you can do at this point.",
            "The kids are old enough to stay at home but it's not cool they left their kids at home on a holiday. My then 16 and 15 year old kids didn't want to come on a trip with us last year so they stayed home. I don't think that's the issue though. Sounds like your sister and her husband just don't care and ditch the kids whenever they want. That's very different than something mutually agreed upon by the kids and parents. ",
            "Hi OP. \n\nI know I\u2019m late to this and it\u2019s already been resolved (on its own). But I felt the need to comment because something EXTREMELY similar happened with my aunt and her piece of shit husband a couple of years ago and I can STRONGLY relate to your situation. \n\nThere is no easy answer. To everyone else, it\u2019s obviously clear that your sister needs to leave that man. But it\u2019s tricky because she keeps going back. You can\u2019t shit talk her husband because that just makes her either resent you when their relationship is going well, or afraid to tell you things when the relationship is going bad because she doesn\u2019t want to hear an \u201cI told you so.\u201d But no way should that man be allowed in your house or your lives. Your sister is making the decision to keep him in her life, but that does not mean you have to.\n\nThis is how my family handled it. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the right thing to do, and I\u2019m not saying it will work for yours. But maybe a shared experience will at least help give you a direction to head towards (or to rule out, your choice):\n\nMy mother has made it very clear to my aunt that her husband is not welcome around our family. My mom explained to her how she doesn\u2019t want to subject herself to that for her own mental well being, and will not allow him around our family ever again for our own safety. On the other hand, my aunt and the children are always welcome to come over and to attend our family events, but never the husband. He is a nutty, manipulative man, and we have the right to cut that toxicity out of our lives, even if my aunt doesn\u2019t want to.  Additionally, my parents make sure to reach out to the kids and provide the structure and support they never received from their parents. \n\nHopefully this helps in some way if an issue ever comes up with not wanting the husband around again. Best of luck, OP",

You gave me a lot to think about so when it came time to talk to Cindy, I wouldn't trip over my words or anything.\n\nI took her out to lunch yesterday (Sunday), and just very matter-of-factly told her how I was tired of her disparaging my bf, how I was tired of her putting down nursing as a profession and dismissing it just as \"women's work\", and finally told her that despite her insistence that she was just joking, I found her \"jokes\" offensive and was done with hearing them. I made it very clear that my boyfriend hadn't sent me to defend him but that I was the one who was offended and tired of it.\n\nShe started to cry a little (which was alarming) and broke down and told me why she was doing what she was doing. Apparently, long story short, in her first marriage, Cindy's income was more than double of that of her husband. After a year or so of marriage, he quit his job and ended up just mooching off of her. He became incredibly emotionally abusive and ruined her financially until she was able to get out and leave him. Basically--she was nervous that the same would happen to me, and she hoped that her \"jokes\" would sway my opinion enough to leave my bf. \n\nI was kind of ??????? about her explanation, but she told me that she knew the jokes were childish and offensive, but she didn't know how else to go about it. She said that I was the closest thing to a daughter she had, and that she loves me very much and that she felt awful about everything.\n\nI started getting teary at this, and I told her that the jokes especially hurt from her because she's someone I care deeply for, and she apologized profusely for having offended/hurting me. She said she really thought my boyfriend was a nice guy and that she wanted to get to know him better, which thrilled me. \n\nI went home, told my boyfriend (who didn't know why I was gone, I wanted to be covert about it), and he was thrilled. He told me that secretly he WAS upset about the jokes, as he knew that Cindy was someone I cared a lot for, but put on a game face because he didn't want to drive a wedge in between us. He told me he loved me, and thanked me for standing up for him, and said he's looking forward to getting to know Cindy better too! And my dad is over the moon as well :)\n\nThank you for your advice, all! <3 Communication really is key.\n   \n**tl;dr**: Cindy and I talked, she apologized, my boyfriend is happy, my dad is happy, and my family is the best :)",

I can imagine it might be hard for my husband to plug away at work all day knowing that I can just pick up a moonlighting shift and make as much as one of his paychecks.  I think you are in a somewhat better position being with someone who is in health care, and understands (a) how important their work is and (b) how hard you work at your job as well.

There was some blunt reality but it felt loving and it\u2019s a big part of what made me realize I was fooling myself in thinking my husband would change or that his habits and behaviors wouldn\u2019t negatively effect our kids.\n\nI was encouraged to start seeing a therapist which I did. The first one I tried ended up being a beautiful fit which I regard as nothing less than a miracle. She was blunt and insightful and gave me the courage I needed to face my guilts and fears and put my kids first. \n\nHe\u2019s an addict. That is a lifelong battle. And because of everything else he has put me through and let me do alone, I just do not have the love necessary to want to face that battle together with him forever. \n\nIt took me just under 3 months from feeling totally conflicted to conquering my doubts, making a plan, and getting the hell out. Making that plan was seriously my biggest obstacle. And I let it be, I think I used it as a crutch. Finally, I sat there for 2 hours and went through every possibility till it just clicked and I went \u201cduh! That can totally work!\u201d 5 days later I took all my stuff and the kids while he was at work. \n\nHere is what I want to share with those who face similar situations: my therapist let me know as kindly as she could that although I did a great job of protecting my kids, there was no way I could guarantee 100% that they would always be safe there. And if they ever got into any of those drugs or were harmed because of them, my kids would also be taken away from me for staying in a home where I knew those dangers were present, for subjecting them to it. \n\nThat shattered my perception of control real fast. Because its true. We cannot watch every movement every minute. \n\nI just wanted to stand proudly and say that after 7 years of desperately clinging to any chance at happiness, equality, and a partnership, I was finally able to leave the man I have been in love with for 16 years. I truly believed with every fiber of my soul he was my one true love. \n\nAnd I almost didn\u2019t make it through the first week away...it was much more difficult than I expected having grown to hate him so much...it still hurt...but I did make it through and already I am so much happier, so much freer, my kids are more loved (he is finally giving them attention), and I can see hope for us all. \n\nI made excuses for his behavior because I felt I could see the nuance of it all...But what others helped me realize is that some behavior needs no nuance to it. Some stuff is just fucked up no matter how you slice it.\n\nSo I just wanted to encourage anyone else who is in a similar situation, you might need to start talking more about your problems so that others can help you see how little control you have and how horrible it really is. Then put yourself first, don\u2019t let them manipulate you back in, and get the hell out if you know in your heart you should.\n\nTL;DR my husband is a lazy, selfish drug addict who I could just never quite convince myself to leave. But I finally shared my struggles with others who helped me see the real problems and accept the solution: taking the kids and GTFO. Already we are so much better off \u263a\ufe0f",

Unfortunately, even though you're not together in the same house any more, you're still going to have to protect them from him as an unstable, addictive personality in their lives.\n\nI'm sure you're aware of all this (and obviously know him better than I do!), but as someone who grew up with a very manipulative parent-figure, that part made some alarm bells go off in my head. Just be cautious about fully embracing this change.",
            "I\u2019m so glad you were able to find the strength and get out safely and your children safely. I\u2019m glad you have such a strong support system around you.

Were you able to retain your job?",

            "Way to go girl. \n\nI am also in the process of leaving my boyfriend who is an addict, who I\u2019ve been with for 7 years. I understand how hard it is. And how hard it\u2019s been to carry the weight of everything on your shoulders. But it is so freeing to be done. I am never trapping myself into that kind of relationship ever again. \n\nWe have a baby together who is my #1 priority. I appreciated the reminder about your child being taken away if you knowingly subject them to living in a house where there\u2019s drugs. That\u2019s a really important reality check.",

            "I bet if you told your MIL what your therapist said about your kids getting taken away if they got hurt in that environment (or honestly if someone ever tried to report you) it might help her look at this in a way that would help her understand.\n\nShe was trying to protect her son in a very twisted way, and enabled him to a dangerous point. I see why she struggled with you leaving him, but he is beyond any one person\u2019s help. At this point she had to choose between her child and grandchildren, because unfortunately she can\u2019t choose both.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the status of your divorce and custody will be, but it\u2019s possible for your MIL to be in their life without the father. Maybe if she knew you\u2019d allow her to stay in their life as long as she didn\u2019t let them anywhere near their father, she\u2019d be happy to oblige. I don\u2019t know the legality of anything, but I\u2019ve definitely seen grandparents kept in the loop even when the parent has been pushed out. Good luck!",

Just dropping a comment because in your original post you wrote\n\n>but I know if I end this marriage, we will never be a family again.\n\nand I want to say (and I hope you know) that this is not true. I'm glad your husband is paying more attention to the kids since the separation, but even if he didn't change at all, you will still be happier in the long run without him.\n\nYou will still be a happy, intact family even without him. If the family unit shrinks, it's still a family. And it will be a happier household without everyone walking on egg shells and feeling the looming presence of an addict.\n\nYou said,\n\n>my 6 yo often tells me we should just live without daddy\n\nKids are way more perceptive than we give them credit for. Your child knew the solution. After the first few tough days, you will come to see that you plus your kids are far happier than you'd be as you plus your kids plus your husband.\n\nThis actually IS the way to keep the family intact and happy.",

I have been thinking of my plan... It is still very murky... As I am pregnant and due in April. I still am so confused and lost. I have applied for housing, wait list number 1605, and have been job searching. I want to attempt to save money and hang in there until income tax to try to get him to give me at least half. It is hard though being around him because I still crave his attention and affection yet he ignores my existence until he wants something. I know what he is. He is a narcissist with a few addictions as well.  But its hard breaking that perception that I had, of two separate men. One I love and one I hate. But they are not separate...

            "This storie takes place 3 weeks ago 8th grade me and this kid well let's call him Jake were best freinds. We told eachother everything. On day we decided to get into a to watch a movie but over facetime. Jake decides to add a girl we will call her Diana. Jake adds Dianato the facetime I barely know her but she was real popular dated multiple guys. Shes says that she doesnt have Netflix and me and jake didnt know our passwords to Netflix. So we had to take turns to hold up the phone to screen for her to watch. I had the better phone and wifi so she preferred me to hold it up.\n\nWell the movie ends and we still stay in the facetime its 2 in the morning and were just talking. Diana decides to say that she had a crush on me in the beginning of the year. She leaves at that caused I just ignored it she bring it up again and says I think me and Heda (me) might date this year. I dont believe but at the same time I really wish it would happen.\n\nFast forward a couple of weeks I start to take a interest in her. Then out of luck she breaks up with her boyfriend. 4 days later its friday I go home I get in a facetime with them I leave. Then me and her  were texting at 2 in the morning Diana asks me if I like her in say yes and shes says she likes me to. She ask if I think that Jake knows that that she likes me and if she should tell him. While this all just happens I was in a facetime with Jake. I'm laughing my ass off and I'm so happy that she likes me. Jake ask what's up I tell him and I can see his face that he is jealous or something. We hang up a hour later and I go to ask Diana out. She says yes we start to date the very next morning Jake is ghosting us. Not even leaving us on read.\n\n Monday comes and I go up to Jake and ask what's wrong and he ignores me and just leaves while my freind are asking what's wrong to him. That entire day I was depressed that I just lost my best freind my homie. And it had made no sense because he had a crush on her in 6th but then got over it. He Also had a girlfriend in 7th grade and he always talked to me in 8th grade on he much he misses her and he wants to get back with her. So I thought I can shoot my shot. I did and I got what I wanted if I had known he would have acted like that I would have never dated her. I date her for a week and she breaks up with me cause she still cant get over her first love we will call him Eric.\n\nMonday comes I cant go to school cause I felt sick and depressed. Tuesday comes (which is today) I go to school and I talk to my freinds and she ignores me and is trying to get at another guy. My friend told me that on monday after school she had told him that she was trying to get at Eric. I was pissed and I go to my first class and I remember I have her for my first. I'm trying to figure out how can ignore her. While I'm walking to first I see Jake and Diana talking as if they're best freinds again. I go up to him and they both ignore me. They walk off and I'm just in shock and I felt like crying. I got to the bathroom and I start to feel sad. Then I start to feel rage. I'm telling myself why the fuck did I date her she ruined everything. I'm punching everything and I just want revenge. I just wanted to get out of school. Then I  call my dad to pick me up. While I'm waiting I start to think of killing myself but then I shrug it off and gets get the depressed.\n\nThe Tuesday party happend 2 hours ago idk what to do I'll keep you guy updated. If anything happens on Wednesday I'll edit it. If you guys can leave some advise it will be much appreciated.",

            "I am a 57-year-old man who was addicted to opiates because of debilitating headaches as a young man. My irresponsible doctor just prescribed Vicodin, instead of working to find out WHY I was having the headaches (which later, another doctor did and treated them, helping me to find a way out). This doctor wrote me a prescription for 50 \"Norco\" Vicodin (2.5 mg of Tylenol and 10 mg of hydrocodone) with multiple refills. At one point I was taking 50 every 4 days. This went on for months, until the pharmacy I went to refused to refill my prescription. I won't go into my story about that, but things went on like that for 3 years (this started about 6 months after our first child was born). My wife and I had a 3-year-old son and a newborn (I got sober long enough to make her feel we could have another child, but I relapsed soon after her was born). I had no job, and hadn't worked in 2 years. The opiates made me angry, short-tempered and depressed. I isolated from everyone, my friends, my family, my wife and kids. I know my wife was so sad about it all, because this just wasn't me. I had always been a very vibrant, engaged, gregarious and loving person. The opiates totally changed me into a lazy, self-pitying, emotionally-abusive monster. When things got too bad, I would kick off the pills (which was some of the worst experiences of my life). I would start to become my old self, but the headaches were too much and I would relapse, becoming a selfish, obnoxious a-hole once again.\n\nFinally my family staged an intervention, which I rejected by justifying that without the opiates I would return to the debilitated state I had been with the headaches. Finally, my wife packed up the kids and left me. I was furious. I said ugly things on the phone to her, things I can never take back (thankfully my wife is very forgiving and doesn't throw that up in my face, but she would be totally justified if she did). After 2 weeks without my family I finally agreed to go to rehab. It was horrific. The headaches returned with a vengeance. Thankfully, the staff there introduced me to a doctor that actually cared and did the work to try and help me rather than just medicate me. To this day, we really don't know what was going on, but the migraine medication Imitrex helped my headaches. When I left rehab, which only lasted 1 week (yeah, great insurance) I relapsed. I relapsed several times. The difference was, I was now resolved to be clean and widened the circle, going to N/A and involving my friends again so I had accountability. I kept relapsing, though, until someone suggested a new program with a drug called Suboxone and I made an appointment with a doctor that prescribes the drug. I thank God that I decided to go to that appointment, because Suboxone stopped my headaches and completely ended my cravings and drug-seeking behavior.\n\nAfter five months, my wife and kids moved back in the house (they had been staying at a friend's house, who was so kind and gracious during all of this). I got a job, which required drug testing, but Suboxone doesn't show up on the drug tests. I was my old self again, and thankfully this happened soon enough that we have many wonderful baby and toddler memories (sadly, we also have bad memories, but the good outweigh the bad). \n\nMy wife absolutely did the right thing. In fact, she actually waited too long, but really that was my fault. I would keep her from leaving by kicking and becoming (somewhat) the person I was before. It was just enough to string her along for 3 years. It was all my fault, NOT HERS, that this happened. I love her and admire her for leaving when she did, because it took a lot of courage. Her leaving was the impetus behind me getting sober and getting my life back. She left to protect our children, and to protect herself, and really to try to get me to wake up and take action... and it worked. Her leaving was the most loving thing she could have done. She has told me how hard it was and how devastated she felt doing it, living in a one bedroom apartment with our friend, with my little son wanting to know where daddy was and crying for me all the time. She has forgiven me, but she could never forget how it was... feeling so alone, my little son crying, not knowing if I would take action or just vegetate on the couch and throw away the rest of my life. We had always been very close. Because of our religious beliefs, she was a virgin when we got married, so I was the only man she had ever \"known\". She told me later that she had no intention of being with someone else, but resolved to live out her life as a single mom. Would she have done that? Who knows, but what a wonderful woman she was (is) to love me so well! Oh my god, just writing those words... I'm sitting here crying. How sweet she was, saying that, meaning those words!\n\nThat was over 22 years ago and I've tried to love my wife well so she would never regret giving me another chance. I haven't been a perfect husband, not by a long shot. She has been pretty darn close to a perfect wife, and I thank God that she was strong enough to do what she needed to do to protect our children, to protect our family. To the OP: you are absolutely doing the right thing. It's a wonderful thing that you had the courage to do this, because I can only imagine how hard it was and is. Never beat yourself up about not leaving earlier. I look back at how low I got and wonder how in the heck that happened? I would never have chosen to live that vacant, selfish existence, but it wasn't a single choice. It was a collection of choices that led me sinking deeper and deeper and ultimately becoming only a shell of my former self. That is how it happens; it's like a frog in boiling water. It happens little-by-little, choice-by-choice, and pretty soon you look up and go, how in god's name did I get here?! You are to be commended that you found the courage to make this incredibly difficult, life-changing decision. My only suggestion is that you surround yourself with those that support you, that will help you stay strong and keep you accountable to your good choices. Going to a therapist was such an amazing first step (wow, I'm amazed by you). Keep it going. Don't stop going, if you can afford it. Stay strong, but remember that you are vulnerable and you need support. Posting here was smart and shows that you are making good choices and doing what you need to do to support yourself and your children. Keep being smart and strong.\n\nIt won't be easy, because we drug addicts are really good at lying and manipulating. Your husband can make your life really difficult, so make sure you have people in your life to insulate yourself from his toxic garbage. Even though I would get angry at my wife and say mean things on the phone, inside I was so ashamed of myself. I was so in awe of her and I f\\*\\*king hated myself for putting her through that. She cried so hard on the phone, trying to convince me that she was doing this because she loved me and our children. I threw it back in her face and tried to make her feel guilty for leaving. I tried to convince her that leaving me would ruin her life. It was awful, but deep inside I was admiring her and dying... dying.. dying because I was hurting her. Finally, when I cracked and agreed to go to rehab, I cried like a baby and begged for her forgiveness. I told her how much I loved her and admired her for leaving and she was stunned. She thought I didn't love her anymore and now hated her! What a PIG I was to make her feel that!!! She stayed the course though, and unbelievably only got stronger the more nasty I got, because she knew I was finally cracking. The apathy and hopelessness gave way to anger, which gave way to sadness, and my horrible actions finally made me realize how sick I was and how I needed help. When the wheel finally turned and I admitted what a mess I was, she amazingly supported me and loved me, but remained firm. In my lucid moments I told her  not to give in, to not listen to me, to stay strong and don't listen to my lies. She did stay strong and whew... how I love her for that.\n\nYour husband might never get well, and even if he does, you might never want to even think about taking him back. Sometimes the damage is too great and you just have to move on. His actions destroyed your relationship and now he will have to live with the consequences. You have to do what you need to do to protect yourself and your children. So, feel good for doing that and never let him make you feel bad. He knows he's wrong. He knows what a monster he is, even if he won't admit it. I'm so very blessed that my wife chose to take me back, but she would have been totally justified to divorce me and move on with her life. Sometimes that is the most loving thing you can do for you and your family.\n\nSorry I wrote so much, but your story really touched me and reminded me what hell I put my wife through. I'm so fortunate be sober and still married to my sweetheart. I'm so sorry that he's put you through this. I'm sorry that you have to start over. You did the right thing, though! (I hope this doesn't sound condescending, but) I'm proud of you! God bless you and your children. My wife and I are praying for you! Stay strong and take care of yourself and your babies. Keep us posted on how you are doing as you are able.",
