My mom was just as bad as i thought, she cried, she yelled, things even got physical. Long story sort i told her i hated her and she is dead to me then my dad send her to stay in our vacation house.\n\nAll these were 4 days ago. Im back to my apparment now. My dad isn't sure if he will stay with her or not, we have been talking every day cause i want him to feel supported.

            "That must\u2019ve been so hard to keep secret. Know that none of what follows is your fault. She made her own choices, and your dad will make his own choices. No matter what happens, you aren\u2019t to blame.",
            "I would take some time off by myself to clear off my head. Sorry to read what happened, and I hope you feel better soon.",
            "Cutting horrible people out of your life sure feels good doesn't it? I hope you encourage your dad to do it too so the whole family can be free of her. Either way, keep supporting him and way to go.",
            "I\u2019m really sorry that your mother put you in the middle here. A similar thing happened to me a few years ago and it took years for me to trust in and respect my mother again. I hope that you are doing okay and you don\u2019t blame yourself at all, telling your dad was the best thing you could have done.",
            "I missed the original but appreciated the update as I read it in two parts, like an extended post. It's always nice to follow up since there's no way for anyone to ask how things went and you'd be amazed how many people care at least a little!",
            "24F here. My mother kind of did the same thing to me a few years ago. I was 17 at the time, and she came forward to me about her affair because her boyfriend's wife called my father and told him about everything. It was pretty crazy, both my parents got me and my sister too involved in the whole situation. I just know that at some point she wanted me to meet the guy, and I actually did go meet him. It was pretty fucked up. \nYears went by, and therapy helped me process a lot of what happened. One of the explanations for my mother's behavior was she was seeking validation.\nI just want to let you know it's okay to feel like you need to get that off your chest, and there's probably a whole lot more to come. Remember they're adults in their own relationship, and my advice would be stay out of it as much as you can. This doesn't mean you shouldn't support your father or anything. Just try not to get too involved in the fights and small situations that will arise from this almost every day, for your own good.\nAnd find a friend or someone you can talk to about what you're feeling and how you're doing.\nI wish you the best.",
            "Good for you! That\u2019s just what I would have done",
            "Sorry for your situation OP. Keep supporting your dad and you\u2019ll get through this together.",
            "How did you hold it for an year!??",
            "Good for you! I\u2019m so glad you said something.\nThi would have been very hard to deal with. Support your dad as much as you can. It\u2019s a very hard thing to go through. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve cut her off, she has done a terrible thing.",
            "I'm sorry, OP. Your mother should have never involved you in this. It should never have been your burden to bear. Due to how cloak and dagger it all was, she was likely not firing on all cylinders, but that's hardly an excuse to drag you into it. Even given that benefit of the doubt, physical assault (against you?) is totally unacceptable under any circumstances, not to mention illegal.\n\nRemember, none of this is on you. You were put in an impossible situation against your will. Do not let *anybody* tell you otherwise.",
            "Damn kinda jealous that your dad handled it so well. When my mom was cheating on my dad, they decided to just get a divorce and my mom went insane, and my dad just got stressed and distant, and our family broke apart. My dad kept telling me I was supposed to have a relationship with her because \"she's my mom\" even though she was literally abusing us and being awful. Idk why some people stick their heads in the sand like that. I can't do it. But I'm glad it worked out alright for you.",
            "I had to go through a similar situation during highschool. I figured out my dad was cheating on my mother (married for 30 years) when he left his phone unlocked and I snooped bc of suspicions I had. I kept the secret for 8 months because I didn\u2019t know what to do because my mother has no work history to leave him but when I told my brother, a few months later when the abuse (by my father) got really bad we confronted him. \nIt\u2019s been 3 years since, and let me tell you something. I didn\u2019t know that there were more times of cheating that my mother was *aware of.* A lot of times, it\u2019s not the only one, and it\u2019s really hard to trust the person ever again. From what I hear, it seems your mother hasn\u2019t been the best to you guys in many ways, and things like that are very hard to change. Say you make up with her, she\u2019s going to insist you have a relationship with this new man and you might never feel okay with it. Your father may end up staying with her, but she\u2019s still with this person right? He\u2019s not going to be able to trust, and that\u2019s a whole lot worse than going different ways. \nBasically, she has been the source of your turmoil, and it\u2019s very fair for you to part ways with her. Keep in mind that if he stays, you might be parting ways with him too. If he doesn\u2019t, really be there to support him because the loneliness after the separation is what really makes it hard on your parent. \nSorry for the ramble, but I sincerely hope things turn out for the best. Love and support your father through this, and do encourage him against staying with her but respect his decision if he does. I hope you too find peace of mind, friend.",
            "Wow props to you to be able to keep it in for so long.",
            "Sounds like a heavy situation, but I'm glad its seemed to work out, both you and your dad deserve someone who actually knows the value of family and I'm glad your there supporting your father, I hope for the best for your father and keep being there for him!",
            "Good for you for telling your father. I\u2019m so sorry you were put in that position though.",
            "Sorry for the betrayal, your mom betrayed son & dad.",
            "Stay strong brother, you did the right thing. I would have done exactly the same.",
            "My last convo with my dad was about like your convo. It sucked because he ended up dying. He stole from me, I was pretty livid. I don\u2019t carry guilt as I know he knows I loved him and had every right to get mad, but it still sucks. Just things to consider going forward. I was 20.. it\u2019ll have been 14 years this winter.",
            "You did a good thing. Knowing the truth is always better than not.",
            "I saw the responses to this same post on r/adultery (not sure why it was recommended, I don\u2019t follow it) but you can\u2019t expect liars and cheaters to be upset with your mom along with you. They\u2019re always going to validate and defend their own \u201clifestyle\u201d of ruining others\u2019 lives.",
            "So sorry that you had to go through this. It honestly sounds crazy that your mum would do that to you.   \n\n\nSince she didn't know that you knew she was cheating, that could be a really risky for her to be found out, so maybe she wanted you to know somehow ? And was maybe hoping you would somehow get along with him and be okay with everything. If that's the case, she is extremely deluded.   \n\n\nAnyway great job supporting your dad, you will come out of this better.",
            "Wow! You are super brave and did a really good job, for what it\u2019s worth I\u2019m proud of you and think you\u2019re great.",
            "Dang a whole year you had to keep that secret. None of this is your fault and your mom is a pos. Please keep being a support system to your dad. Thank you for telling him. Cheaters endanger their partners health bc you have no clue if they\u2019re being safe. Thank you for telling your dad and helping him emotionally and physically",

            "Your dad is great dude.\n\nKeep supporting him and cut your mother out compeletly,try not to get involved in your dad's decision to keep her or dump her.\n\nJust keep in mind that your dad is going through a very very rough time right now,your top priority is focusing on making your dad feel better.",
            "As someone who's been in a very similar position to you, good.\nCut the egg donor out of your life, you don't need to love someone who you know is trash inside regardless of their relationship to you.\nI'm still angry.\n\nI hope that you can recover better than I did.",
            "Good job! It must have taken a lot of courage but it was the right thing to do. I\u2019m sure your dad is grateful, even if it hurts.",
            "For your mum to first make you keep that secret, then try make you have a relationship with him is such a low blow and so disrespectful to you and to your dad as a person. \nAs much as I usually feel people should stay out of others relationships it wasn\u2019t fair to your dad that she was basically flaunting her affair in front of him by making it open like that and he deserves better. Plus she only has herself to blame, not you, and you\u2019re allowed to hate her - you don\u2019t get to pick family but you have your own feelings you must consider. \nIt\u2019s up to your dad if he stays or leaves her but I\u2019m glad he has your support, you seem like a wonderful child to him and he\u2019s lucky to have you!",
            "Parents should never try to make ther children their \u2018friend\u2019, their therapists,... even worse if its about the relationship between the parents\n\nEvery parent knows that is damaging the child, no matter the age of the child. \n\nIts something else if one parent needs help to move. like flee an abuser (no matter if its the mother or the father, both genders can be abusers), but even then, help to pack and transport the things is not the same as being the \u2018sounding board\u2019 of the parent\n\nI\u2019d look into getting some hours of therapy, for finding the best coping mechanisms, and also to train possible answers/reactions for the future, might be helpful in general after all that.",
            "I went through this with my parents too, it\u2019s actually uncanny how similar your situation is to mine. Your mother was probably pushing for you to hang out with him to make her feel better and hoping you will justify what\u2019s she\u2019s done since he\u2019s so great and hoping you see how in love they are or whatever. I can almost garuntee that her next move will be trying to convince you that her marriage was pure misery and that things have been bad for a long time or that your dad wasn\u2019t good to her. Don\u2019t fall for that shit, it\u2019s total garbage. If she truly were miserable this whole time - then why didn\u2019t she just get a divorce? Don\u2019t let her reel you in with the victim shit. I think it\u2019s reasonable not to talk to her, hopefully things will level out and you can maybe salvage this relationship but the ball is in her court. Remember that although you are an adult, you are still the child in this relationship. My mom eventually started acting like a teenager and would get upset if anyone said a word about how little time she was with her kids post separation and blamed it on me. I didn\u2019t reach out, I didn\u2019t do enough etc etc etc she is the parent, and she can either act like one or fuck off",
            "Id personaly advise Ur dad to leave her, first of all most cheaters dont change they fall back into their awfull past, second of all the way Ur mom reacted is a sign of how bad of a person she is and third of all, if he stayed yall can never be a normal family again, everything u would visit u would be hating Ur mom and rightfully so which couldd lead to fights within the family and to mabye even a bad relationship with your dad.",
            "You held onto this for other a year? Thats WILD",
            "OP, that sucks a lot and I\u2019m so sorry you went through that. As someone who\u2019s been through a similar situation with my mother (verbally abusing me, tearing t he family apart and blaming me, pushing me to have a relationship with the man she cheated with) a few years ago, my biggest advice to you is to not burn bridges with her. She\u2019s your mom, and without her in your life it starts to feel empty and all-consuming. It would be helpful to future you to take a step back now and outline exactly why you\u2019re upset with her, being specific as possible, then ask for some space until you\u2019ve worked through your end a little (even if you never plan on talking to her again now). I developed some awful habits while coping with not talking to my mom and I don\u2019t want the same for you. If you can communicate with her that you want a break now but will want to come back later, it helps act defensively against her saying you\u2019re a petulant child (my mother still holds this against me, even when we\u2019re on good terms). This is awful and you don\u2019t deserve any of this and you did the right thing, but no matter how angry you are with your mom try not to end your relationship for good. You never know if you might want to go back. Sending good thoughts your way!",
            "I am glad you are there for your dad. Hope the both of you can support each other through this nightmare.",
            "I was in similar situation just with my dad and his girlfriend, I was 16, then my parents divorced when I was 19 and now at 26 I can see my mum finally living her full life again. Just chiming in to say that you\u2019re not alone in this and people care, so many of us were where you\u2019re now. Try to be nice to yourself now, you\u2019re going through a hard time. And good job! I think you handled it really well my man",
            "Keeping that must've been so difficult for you and we'll done for getting it out there. I'm glad that your relationship with your dad is still strong and tbh good on you for not befriending your mother's boyfriend!",
            "Yeah, that's weird. Be cordial with him, but not friends.....",
            "Your dad deserves better! I know it\u2019s hard but he can still meet someone else and be happy.\nWas their marriage ok before this? Was she a good parent and spouse before you found out?\nHer reaction to her doing something wrong makes me think she sucks!",
            "You have every right to be angry. If I had any advice, it would be that the only way you\u2019ll ever find healing in this situation, will be to forgive her at some point in the future. On your time of course.",
            "You\u2019re a good dude mate.  Good-looking our for your pops.  Your mom has a lot of repenting to do.  Screw her for doing this to you and your father.  If I were you I\u2019d build up your dad\u2019s confidence as much as possible.  He\u2019ll need it should shit get nasty with mommy dearest or when he needs to find a new woman.  Also too, remember that if someone has cheated once, they are prone to do it again.  Your mom would likely be more crafty about it the second time.  If your dad can afford a vacation home, he\u2019s probably decently well off, and your mom may be a gold-digging sleaze who\u2019s merely using him for his assets while getting her poontang on the side.  At this point, assume the worst until proven otherwise.",
            "You are so brave!! Proud of you for doing what's right!",
            "It\u2019s good you told him.   They were making a fool of him.",
            "I can\u2019t believe your mum wanted you to be friends with someone she was cheating with. People are ... wow \ud83e\udd2f I\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling better and I hope you and your dad work through this . Good luck",
            "I remember reading your post. I\u2019m glad things are sorting out as best they can in this situation and that you no longer need to shoulder the burden. \nYou should treat yourself to something special just for you.",
            "I don\u2019t really believe that it\u2019s a relief to have your mother be \u201cdead to you.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s your mother and it\u2019s far more complicated than this.",
            "There may be other reasons to completely cut off your mom. Lots of people cheat and relationships end. Of course that doesn't make it ok, but it's an unfortunate reality. \n\nNow if you have other reasons to cut off your mother then please, by all means do so. What she did to you and your father was hideous. But I don't think that alone rises to the level of cutting her off. Just to be clear, I mean permanently cut her off, which is how I read your post. As in, when she dies and you might show up to the funeral, maybe.\n\nI don't think there's anything wrong wrong with temporarily cutting her off why your parents figure out their next steps. I mean, she tried to throw you in the middle of an affair and make you complicit. That's not acceptable. But once the divorce (or once your parents decide to work it out) is finalized, and your parents have established their new status quo and are starting to settle in, then I think that you should continue some level of contact with your mom. It doesn't need to be a lot necessarily, but completely cutting off a parent is a big step that's really only warranted in extreme situations. \n\nIf this is an extreme situation following a lifetime of abuse, then by all means do what you have to do."

Just know that whatever is going on with your brother is not your fault and sometimes it's really hard for parents to recognize when something fucked up is happening with their kid. Denial is strong. I hope they will be supportive of you in the future. If not, man, you're in college? Utilize whatever resources there that you can. If there are counseling services, just go at least a few times and talk out whatever you want to, if you want to.",
            "I'm so sorry you're going through all of this, and especially so that something so frightening had to happen for this to be taken seriously.\n\nTake some time to read up about to positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  His past behaviour won't seem as 'creepy' but obviously is still worrying.  Maybe have a discussion with your parents about how you're going to approach this as a family, and support him in his continued treatment (of course, you should feel free to opt out if you don't feel safe, but I feel like counselling with family will be helpful and make it clear to them how unsafe you were feeling, and how it is vitally important that they trust your judgement).\n\nStatistically, your brother is much more a danger to himself than to you.  The idea of a deranged schizophrenic killer is at odds with the reality--many people live with schizophrenia and, medicated, will not experience violent episodes.  However, because he may have had paranoid or persecuted thoughts around you in the past, you may wish to be extra careful and get a personal alarm, pepper spray, whatever.\n\nAgain, I'm so sorry.  It's very difficult for any family to go through.  I really hope you are able to access support for yourself, as well as your family doing so to support your brother (medication compliance cannot be stressed enough).",

        "selftext": "Alright so I married my husband (37M) about 6 months ago. He had an 18 year old when he was 19 and was married to her mother for about 15 years.\n\nThey got divorced and we get his kids (15F, and 8M) for 2 weeks and then their mother gets them for 2 weeks. The 18 year old (let's call her Brittany) lives with her (45M) boyfriend. I've had a really great relationship with all 3 kids. Once brittany started dating her current boyfriend who is 45, the relationship between her and my husband really started going sour. I dont support her decision but her and I remained close and I did my best not to isolate her.\n\nAfter Brittany and I started growing closer she started taking more and more advantage of me and my kindness. Her boyfriend doesnt make much money and she doesnt have a job. Her sisters birthday is tomorrow and a couple of weeks ago she mentioned a nice coat her sister wanted and asked me if I would just go look with her.\n\nWe didnt have any luck at our local mall so I spent some time finding a nice coat on Amazon and asked Brittany if her sister would like it, she said yes and so I ordered it. \n\nWe dont get her sister on her actual birthday, but we are celebrating it today (1 day early). I had told brittany that the coat could be from the both of us, since I found it and paid for it but she did tell me the style/color her sister wanted.\n\nThen I get a text from Brittany saying that No, she wants to give it to her on her actual birthday and tell her mother she paid for it to prove that her and her boyfriend are successful. I told her I wasnt comfortable with that and I'm sorry but it's a group gift from us and for us, her birthday is today since she goes back to her mother's late tonight. I asked her to share her feelings and she said she is really angry at me and thinks I'm being selfish. I dont know how to respond to her. My husband currently has pneumonia which is why I'm turning to reddit and not him since he is really sick right now.\n\nI am new to being a step mom, and I'm really trying here. How do I respond to this? \n\nTldr: bought my 15F step daughter a present. My other step daughter wants to give it to her after she leaves our house and say she bought it.\n\nUPDATE: thank you so much for all of the advice! I truly am so grateful for all of it. Well last night my husband stayed home while I took my 15F stepdaughter and her little brother to dinner at her favorite restaraunt. I invited Brittany and she came with the 45M boyfriend. My 15F step daughter pulled me aside and asked if I invited him, I said no and she told me she really doesnt like him and if in the future we can ask him to not come. I told her I would have a conversation with her dad and her sister. After dinner we all came back to mine and my husbands home. It was pretty awkward, and when she opened the coat Brittany made sure to let her sister know that she picked it out and it was all her idea. I mostly just ignored it and enjoyed the birthday party. Later that night I went to drop off the kids with their mom. After the kids were inside their mom instantly said \"We need to have a conversation about Brittany's behavior.\" And I had a great conversation with their mother about everything, since her behavior is affecting both households and the kids. I talked to my husband and he is going to talk to Brittany, and we also talked about my role in her life and read him lots of the comments from all of you. Yes, the boyfriend thing is terrible, and my husband agrees that he is a predator. I know some comments mentioned the divorce, but overall, the two daughters have expressed the marriage was bad. Their mother had a long affair and it was all just a mess, I appreciate the comments talking about divorce and parenting, but we have all attended classes (me, husband, and ex wife) on co-parenting and we all try really hard to make these kids happy and have a healthy life. I know it's a tough road to navigate, but I really appreciate brutal honesty, and advice. ",

I understand that you want to have a good relationship with Brittany, but letting her take advantage of your kindness is not a way to accomplish that.\n\nI'd perhaps ask her carefully, when she has cooled down somewhat, why she thinks that letting her mother believe that she paid for the coat would prove that \"her and her boyfriend are successful\".\n\nPS: It's possible Brittany feels the need to \"defend\" her relationship not only because her parents are critical of it, but precisely *because* she's not completely happy in it; to smother her own doubts. Maybe hint that she can talk to you in confidence if she has any problems which she can't talk with her parents about.",

She's 18, her brain isn't fully formed yet, she will get over it in time... or she won't, but you cant change it.

While technically she is an adult, in many ways she is still a child. And just because a kid hits adulthood doesn't mean their need for guidance ends. You and her dad obviously cannot forbid her to date this guy (and that would be a bad tactic to take as well), but you could be gently guiding her to see how awful that is and therapy support to help her work through her daddy issues in a healthy, safe way. \n\nYou can find resources online to help get your husband to understand why a huge age gap like this is dangerous for his daughter, and the profound risks she's running.\n\nGood luck, what a nasty situation :( ",

But I'm guessing shes only doing all of this stuff to prove she can be independent. \n\nYou said that she wanted to give the coat as a way to show that her and her creepy bf are successful. She also wants to get pregnant, dropped out of school and is also taking the time to walk all over you. \n\n It seems she doesnt see you as a role model, she sees you as someone she wants to compete with. Being easy on her and being gentle isnt getting through to her. You need tough love. Talk with your husband after hes recovered about having kinda a slap in the face reality talk with her. Just you and her. That way you can show her that family isnt ganging up on her. The fact that all the men in the family told her not to date that douche makes her stubborn. Shes 18, she probably wants to feel like shes grown up enough to choose her own boyfriends, and telling her who she can and cant date is problamatic. \n\nMaybe getting out research about baby care. If she does become pregnant, shes more than likely going to ask you for money, babysitting, generally free service so she can do the things she wants. Pit your foot down AHEAD of time and tell her she'll probably have to be on her own if she truly wants to be independent and have a baby. Show her the costs of diapers, formula, hospital visits, baby vaccines, toys, beds, shoes, clothes, school, etc. Then if you can get the information, show her how much her 'bf' makes. If she tries to oull the 'but I'm your daughter! Why wont you help??' Calmly explain to her that her decisions have consequences and that you and your husband cant be expected to bail her out. \n\nShow her the costs of college and dental school while shes claiming theyre 'successful'. Show her the costs of having a house, and a car. That might be enough to make her snap out of this illusion shes in. \n\nAgain, just suggestions. I had the same thing happen with my niece when she turned 18 (immediately moved in with a 25m bf) and neither had a well paying job since both dropped out of college. \n\nWish you all the luck OP. Teenagers are one hell of an age. \n\n",
            "I think everyone has already given you good advice on how to deal with the gift situation. But I\u2019d like to offer a different perspective on her pedo boyfriend.

It is clear you\u2019ve tried and it didn\u2019t work, so now it\u2019s time to take a step back. I imagine if she comes to a point where she wants to end the relationship, she would be hesitant out of pride and not wanting to be proven \u201cwrong\u201d by her family. Based on this situation it seems she\u2019s still quite immature so youll need to modify your behavior to persuade her. ",

This could just be a power struggle between you and her, but i know i would have never tried to pull this on my step mom.  \n\nI'd let her know that she has two choices.  1. its a group gift, and given today, or 2. She can pay for it and then it can truly be from her.\n\nI 100% agree with telling your husband, and let him know that the decision is between both of you, and not just you.",

As long as your money is tied into it, the gift will be coming from you in part. \n\nHer bit about wanting to say it is from her only in front of her mother is telling. Mom is coming down on her hard about her boyfriend, and this is her chance to throw it back at her mom that mom is wrong and she is right.

She needs to get into some therapy.",

But. Come. On. \n\nAnd, as far as the present - you tell her YOU bought it. Plain and simple. She wants to prove that she's successful? Then she needs to prove it by making better choices. She's the one being selfish here and she needs to learn she can't keep taking advantage of you. If you do decide to let her take all the credit, then you should tell her she needs to financially compensate you for purchasing it. Don't give into someone's spoiled behavior like this OP!",
            "Nope, no. Don't let her use your money and generosity to make her appear to be something she isn't, as well as use you to try to make her family accept her creepy-ass boyfriend. ",

Don't give up on the step daughter, in abusive relationships, they always start trying to isolate their victims.  When all family finally shuns away that's when things will get bad.  The bf does not have any good motives.",
            "In my opinion, you shouldn\u2019t feel bad. She is 18, and if you paid for the coat, it wouldn\u2019t be truthful or fair for her to claim that she bought it and take all credit. She is old enough to go out there and get things on her own...and if she hasn\u2019t done that, it\u2019s not your problem....it\u2019s hers. You can be loving (and it sounds like you have) without letting her run all over you! ",

Gee, I wonder who the selfish one is...\n\nIf you care about her, don't give in. You can forgive her later, but clearly she's lacking an authority figure who can keep her in check. It's great that you can be there for her but you also need to be firm with her, for her own good.",
            "So, I can\u2019t help but think that this old man she\u2019s dating is trying to groom her. I know this isn\u2019t necessarily the topic of this post, but I think as her family, you should try to help get her resources she needs to leave him and try and create an environment that will make her feel safe to return to. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t approach with the \u201cyou need to break up with him\u201d because that doesn\u2019t work (as someone who dated an older guy in high school and college). However, I think that getting her therapy help or other resources for this specific situation is dire. Especially if they are trying for a baby. \n\nBut at the same time, she\u2019s a legal adult, and there isn\u2019t a lot you can do, unless they started a sexual relationship before she was legally old enough. If that\u2019s the case, GET HIS ASS ARRESTED, she\u2019ll that you later.  ",
            "Haven\u2019t heard it put this way, so I might as well frame it a little differently. You have strong principled grounds for disagreeing with your step-daughter\u2019s actions: namely, that she wants to use this gift as a means of validating her relationship by lying about her and her boyfriend\u2019s financial stability. First, you disagree with her dishonesty. That is fair, as dishonesty is not something you should have to tolerate for the sake of your relationship. Second, and more importantly, you - as would any reasonable person - have made a value judgement that her (18!f) relationship with a 45 year-old man is unhealthy, and ultimately undeserving of your support. Her using your generosity to falsely validate this relationship betrays your values in both honesty and as someone in a parental role with her best interests in mind. For you to condone her actions would be to betray your own values, which is something you have good reason to stand against. ",
            "You should update us on what happens. I got the popcorn.  ",
            "It seems you've gotten advice for the main issue here, but I think there's a lot more going on underneath that should be addressed. \n\nWhat was her relationship like with dad before you entered their lives? Has she ever expressed any discomfort with yours and your husbands age difference? I think dating the 45 year old is more of a cry for help than anything. It seems to me that its a quiet way for her to act out some repressed feelings involvong you guys together. \n\nHe definitely is predatory and sounds abusive. It's a dangerous predicament for her to be in, especially if she gets pregnant. What was her parents relationship like? How did their marriage end? Like, those are more rhetorical than anything, but worth considering in this case. If it was more stable with not a lot of fighting, then I wouldn't have expected her to go for a guy like this. \n\nI think she may feel left out or ignored and all of this that she's doing is a ploy to get negative attention from dad so she feels important again. Conning you into making her look good is a way for her to gain control of situations she feels may be out of her control. It's also possible she sees you more as a peer than an adult compared to her, and thinks you should be her buddy and not mom. \n\nFind small ways for her to gain some control back within the family. It may come off as condescending, but ask her if she wants to help you with chores and you could pay her for the work so she could get a late gift for her sister. Don't let her cross boundaries with you, explain that lying isn't okay and you want to work with her. Discuss her relationship, and gently point out things that are unhealthy. Above all, teach this kid to love herself. She needs that most of all, brat or no. \n\n",
            "You're not her friend. You don't need to cover for her terrible life choices. She should be embarrassed about her partner choice. Just be available and don't condemn the relationship to her. That doesn't mean letting her take advantage of you.",
            "Your step daughter, 18F, is looking for false validation of her relationship. And she's dating a guy old enough to be her father. That screams issues. Likely she wants acclaim from Dad, and she's sleeping with her older bf for that reason, too",
            "She is an adult. She needs to take responsibility. Tell her sister/mother the truth. \"Oh, she picked out the gift but she is struggling to put foods on the table. So I pay for it.

            "Whoa. She is very manipulative. Her even having the courage to ask you to take credit for the gift, to me, shows she doesn\u2019t have much respect for you. I\u2019m curious while she was in therapy if she was diagnosed with a personality disorder. The reckless behavior patterns and disregard for others are red flags. And it seems as though she really tries to be the center of attention. (Just based on the few things you posted about) \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you have to go through this with her.

            "You did the right thing. If you really want to you can get another small gift like a keychain or candle or something under 10bucks. Give to Brittany to gift 15f on her own.

            "I\u2019m sorry, but your relationship with your stepdaughter is going to have to get worse before it can get better. \n\nTo me it\u2019s sounds like Brittany is probably a little manic, finding such an older guy etc, but ultimately it sounds like she has pain from her life and she feels like the world owes her something and this issue with the present is an example of this \u201cwhy can\u2019t you just give it to me, it\u2019s not fair that you\u2019re not\u201d. \n\nShe needs tough love, she needs to realise that she\u2019s responsible for her life and her happiness... that\u2019s hard to do without tough love that sees that she needs to respect and love others to receive the same in turn. \n\nIf I were you, I would I would be firm but fair and rather than put too much energy into trying to help her, I would save that energy for her being angry at you and use that energy to be nice back to her and remind yourself that she\u2019s in a rough patch and she\u2019s finding herself and the way she fits in the world and in her family. \n\nShe may hate you for a while and be passive aggressive, but she needs boundaries and you can\u2019t allow this behaviour otherwise you will be her \u2018whipping boy\u2019. \n\nHope this helps.

He was very receptive to my input, open to change, and apologized for slacking off and being lazy. He also thanked me for communicating everything so well. \n\nAfter finally a month when the kids were laid to bed and there was more quiet and less chaos. I sat down at the table and discussed with my husband how I felt burnt out and exhausted assuming nearly all of the household chores and mental load. \n\nThis came after I came prepared with a written sort of cluster diagram of every chore that I do and all the mental \u201cinventory\u201d I have to keep track of in the house (e.g. shampoo, groceries, diapers, kids clothes, toilet paper, etc) I explained that I have to keep all the balls in the air, if I don\u2019t, then it negatively affects how easy the household is run and will negatively affect other people. For example, if I just boycott keeping track of things that run low, such as toilet paper or diapers or laundry detergent, it\u2019s not good for anyone. A kind of \u201cemergency\u201d situation would arise. \n\nIf my husband fails to do his chores, he was oblivious to how it implicitly places the burden on me to pickup the slack. His time spent on leisure activities and not his household responsibilities shifts more chores on to me, while diminishing *my* free time that I could have. The household is like a business and everyone has to chip in and do their part. \n\nAfter explaining all this, my husband was very open and apologetic of the fact he was so unaware of how his behavior and lack of action was negatively affecting me. He confessed his \u201cradar\u201d for seeing things on the floor or that need to be put away just wasn\u2019t there and he really needs to keep working on making that better. \n\nHe also apologized for prioritizing his fun hobby projects over completing his chores first and then, consequently, leaving no time for his chores due to the interruptions of our kids. He also apologized for his lazy behavior and said he\u2019s really going to make a better system for himself to get his household tasks routinely done that doesn\u2019t require me asking. \n\nIn the end, he said he really appreciated me bringing this up in the way that I did and reaffirmed that everything I do \u201cDoes not go unnoticed\u201d and that he is so thankful for all that I do. \n\nIt feels good to talk things through calmly as adults and come to a healthy solution that comes with concrete action. Here\u2019s looking towards a less-stressful future ahead :) \n",

            "I'm glad you and your husband were able to discuss the situation calmly and he responded positively to what you have to say! I am curious however, did y'all actually come up with a plan to divide the household labor? I believe you when you say your husband *intends* to do more work around the home, but as they say, \"The road to hell is paved with good intentions.\" \n\nA plan such as a chore chart, timeline for doing chores (e.g. mop the floor every Wednesday, load the dishwasher every evening) takes away a lot of the need to develop \"radar\". Responsibilities are clearly and explicitly laid out which sets everyone up to succeed.",
            "Ahhhh I have had similar discussions with my partner [28M] and it always starts out amazing! He will get up, do the dishes, tidy up, put the night nappies in the rubbish but then after a week or so he\u2019s back to laziness and hobbies first again! I hope that your husband sticks to this long term for you! ",
            "I kept waiting for the punch line. Good on your husband for his attitude. Can he call and talk to mine?",
            "Hey OP, you should update in a few months to see if your husband has actually made changes or if things have gone back to the way it was.",
            "Your husband is still not being financially fair because none of you domestic labor is compensated.  You say in your last post that expenses are split mainly 50/50 despite him earning 2-3x more than you; you justified this by saying he ends up taking on slightly more cost paying for large purchases and some bills.\n\nThis financial breakdown does not take into account that you perform +80% of childcare and household work-- which you deserve *money* for. This is why families so often share expenses, because its a team effort.\n\nYou and your husband deserve the same amount of financial freedom.",
            "Good on you! I had the same talk with my partner just before New years, about being exhausted and having to take the largest portion of responsibilities and most importantly - the initiative. It's extremely hard having to be the only one to set things in motion all the time, with household chores and general planning always running at the back of ones mind.\n\nWe were both in a rut, but are now in a much better place. Best of luck to you both! ",
            "My husband doesn't see things laying around either. It's bizarre. I had a half-full garbage bag on the ground because I was doing a kitchen clean out, and he tripped over it.\n\nHe goes 'Why did you leave that there?!' (he said it in defence because I said 'What the hell how did you not see that?!') and I'm like... 'I didn't leave it there, I put it there because I'm currently cleaning out the kitchen.' \n\nHim: 'How am I meant to know that'\n\nMe: 'Because I'm literally doing it right now, in front of you.'\n\nHim: 'You should have told me the bag was there'\n\nMe: 'I assumed you would see it because you're an adult with eyes. I'm actually really worried you didn't see that.'\n\nAll said while laughing, might I say.\n\nAnother time which completely dumbfounded me, was I asked him to bring 'the bags' outside, and he misinterpreted and brought the garbage out... to my car... to give to me (???). So I asked him to get the shopping bags instead, which he did. When I got home the garbage was sitting in the middle of the kitchen. Even though he'd brought it out to where the bins were. My brain, I just can't.\n\nBut he also starts reading from the middle of paragraphs and doesn't see signs. Like actual signs. He'll go 'how did you know where to go?' Because there's a sign right in front of us.",
            "Communication wins the day! ",
            "This isn't especially relevant but I am curious after your first post. Do you guys not have a shared bank account? The idea of paying everything 50/50 in a marriage seems weird and overly complicated to me, why do you do it like that? ",
            "I\u2019d be curious to see how you put everything together to shoe him if that\u2019s not too private. I need to have a similar discussion with my husband, and it\u2019s kind of daunting even figuring out where to start.",
            "Haha love it! My partner does say just to remind him and he will do it but constant reminding seems like nagging. Seems easier just to do it myself sometimes ",
            "I\u2019m happy for you that he was so responsive and I hope he maintains the contribution to the household chores!  \n\nThis issue was one of the main things that ultimately led to my divorce after 18 years together. I tried everything to get him to help more around the house, with the kids, etc and ultimately his hobby, job, and computer/phone always came before us. I would talk to him about it, he would get better for a bit, then fall back into the same patterns over and over again. It was super frustrating for me! There were other issues that led to the divorce but this was a big one.  ",
            " that's amazing! I love it. A supportive relationship where are you can come to new understandings through mutual discussion and understanding where the persons coming from. I think you have a great relationship. It's cool that he immediately got what you meant and agreed to be more on board. \nOne suggestion I have as you start to figure out what his new responsibilities will be is to take into account that people have different styles of what is really necessary to be done. Like with my husband he just doesn't care if things are on the floor, it just doesn't matter to him so I try not to put that on him because it feels forced when there's plenty of other chores he could do that he actually agrees are really important. Just a tiny tip as you move forward still be understanding of the other person's thoughts about the whole concept cuz of men and women can be really different about what they feel is a necessary level cleaning. ",
            "You\u2019re me. You\u2019re me literally in 3 years as we are pregnant with our first right now and I feel like that\u2019s my future because it\u2019s lready heading that direction. I would love to know exactly what tactics you used to explain how you were feeling without him just getting defensive and insisting he does enough when he so obviously doesn\u2019t. My husband is also in front of the computer every waking moment he\u2019s not working and I have no idea how to address that positively either. ",
            "You should also revisit your money situation. In your original post you said you pretty much go 50/50 on everything (he pays utilities, but you go for all the household stuff like detergent, diapers etc etc.) which will roughly come out the same I would think. Yet he makes 2-3x what you do. You should maybe do a 33-66% or 25-75% split then. Not only did you work yourself to the bone, you also contributed more financially pro-rata.",
            "My husband and I had a similar conversation during the first 5 years of our marriage. We found what worked was splitting chores based on preference and realistic expectations. Example: I don't mind laundry and he doesn't mind mopping so we each take care of that chore. We both hate cooking, but I get home sooner during the week, so I cook Monday thru Friday and he takes care of the weekend. He also Grocery shops, I do the meal prep. It works for us and keeps the fights at a minimum. ",
            "I\u2019m glad the communication worked out for you! You sounds like a very busy person indeed, but there\u2019s a great book by Tiffany Dufu called \u201cDrop the Ball\u201d that I think you would love. Her story reminds me a lot of yours",

            "I got halfway through this and realized I forgot to add apples and soy sauce to the grocery list, then had to check in for my flight tomorrow and write out the check for this month's dance classes for my daughter - lol. Glad you and so many others have this in check - because I sure don't!",
            "This is cheesy and probably nit-picky, but as much as I love your business analogy I think another astute point of view is to look at family life like a garden that has a variety of needs and requires work and effort for it to thrive ",
            "I have a saying : every time partner 1 say no partner 2 must say yes. For example : partner 1 does not want to change the diaper. While they get to avoid it, partner 2 must then change the diaper, because it must be changed. This goes with most things.\n\nI knew someone who was proud that he got to avoid buying presents for Christmas and birthdays, but his wife hated it too. Yet he applauded himself for d avoiding it, and so his wife had to do it always, because someone must. ",
            "Glad you worked things out OP. To make things even better for you I want to ask if you ever have your kids helping with the chores? My son is five and he's been helping me make things more bearable around the house since he was two. Last night he helped with four loads of laundry that had been piling up. He's strong enough to open the dryer. I have him remove all the clothes and take them to the bedroom where we sort it. Then he sorts a good portion of it! He also washed the dishes last night! All these little things help immensely.",
            "I read this and thought yes he\u2019s a smart man. No arguments, owns it, proposes change. Also provides the woman the recognition she has earned. \n\nI hope there is another update. My guess is one will be needed. ",
            "But why would they be equally shared if you're a stay at home mother? \n\nNo shade, genuine question. I thought that was the point of having a stay at home partner.",
            "This is awesome! Your husband sounds like a good dude. Congrats on communicating your needs so clearly!",
            "I love positive updates like this. Communication is so critical. Delivery is everything too. You did an excellent job of stating the facts and not projecting. \n\nI have to have the same talk with my partner and plan to approach it in the same manner. \n\nThanks for the update! ",

            "Congratulations!  A couple of my married friends had this same conversation and within 2 months they hired a house-cleaner. Still win-win but before he started pulling his weight he would always say it was a luxery they didn\u2019t need.",

            "I need to keep this for notes in the future. I\u2019ve assumed all of the responsibilities between my wife and I and each time I try to talk to her about it, she goes straight to her phone or zoned out. When I call her out on that, she just looks at me and said \u201cwhat?\u201d Or \u201cwhat do you want me to say?\u201d",
            "Happy that things seem to be working out. I became a stay at home mom after our second son was born( they are 23 months apart) I did work half time before my second son was born. Then I stayed home after our second son was born and when he went to kindergarten I went back to work part time.  My husband worked a very demanding job 10-14 hours a day and sometimes got called in during the middle of the night.  We had no family in the area ( we recently moved to the Midwest from the East Coast) that I could depend on. Saying all this, I did it all, you name it I did it. If my husband was home on the weekends ( he worked weekends too) then he did some of the yard work.  But other than that, I pretty much did it all. My two boys are now 17 and 19. My husband and I just celebrated our 30 year anniversary. What I am trying to say is communication and patience is key in a marriage or any relationship. Your house doesn\u2019t have to be perfect! Mine never was and my husband and children survived. Stay strong \ud83d\udcaa and remember you are the stronger sex and good luck.  Just an added note, the baby stage is the easy stage, the teenage years gave my husband and me grey hair \ud83e\udd74",
            "I also wanted to suggest that you go ahead and give him praise when he is doing all these new chores. Give him the positive reinforcement that you wish you had all along :-). He basically agreed to make parts of his day a lot less fun from here on out, so you might as well make sure he knows that you appreciate it!!",
            "My opinion will likely be an unpopular one but it is true and pragmatic.\n\nYour husband is the one out working and making the money to support the family and you are a stay at home mother. In this situation my opinion is that you should be doing 100% of the household chores that don\u2019t require heavy lifting, working with tools etc..\n\nRaising kids is difficult, I understand but it is not nearly as difficult as my job. Managing a department of 6 professionals, meeting timelines and budgets, traveling out of state 30% of the time, working late hours preparing presentations and reports etc.. Put on top of this all the stressful situations I frequently encounter at work like firing, reprimanding people and dealing with high stakes, high stress workplace conflicts on a regular basis.\nThere is a reason I get paid 150k a year for what I do when you can hire a nanny to raise your kids for much less than that. The last thing I am going to do when I get home from work is make dinner for the family, this is the wife\u2019s \u201cjob\u201d.\n\nYou can tell me that I am wrong all you want but the marriages where the man goes out and makes the money and the woman runs the household and raises kids have the highest success rate and results in the best quality children.\n\nAlright I\u2019m ready, start flaming me...",

            "Is work related in any of this? I read you are both adults and have children and seem to be afloat so obviously you have financials in check could this be the problem? I also read that he puts his hobbies in front of his chores and so on which by the way good job for checking him on that it\u2019s always good to be work first play later. If your husband is at work all day and comes home and still helps around the house he is 100% a keeper but if all he wants to do is relax after a long day of work then you guys should both work something out where you can accomplish this. I\u2019m not bashing you in anyway saying just cause you are a woman you are expected to do all the house duties. If your out all hours of the day at your job you deserve a break too. Among your chores around the house is there anything time consuming? A avoided chore that no one likes doing if you will? On the up scale there is nothing wrong with this. You did right by keeping it positive and being adults about the situation.",

            "Some people cant read minds. I( 39M) am one of them but that doesnt give him an excuse to not do any chores especially if he has time for leisure activities. \n\nDoes he work full time and your at home full time? i find often in other couples I speak to that there is a greater expectation for household chores on the stay home parent almost to the point where the partner who goes to paid work doesnt think they need to do anything once they get home.\n\nMy partner ( 39F) is a shift worker and works 4 days a week and I work 4 days a week so we share responsibilities equally around our household chores and 2 kids.\n\nI would also say if you are exhausted then it is important to give yourself a break and if some minor household chore doesnt get done it isnt the end of the world.\n\nTell him a good way is to do little bits of household chores every day it doesnt seem so big a job.\n\nGood luck.",

I want to help him but don't know how.**\n\nHi, even though my original post didn't get a lot of attention, there were some good responses and I thought I would update everyone as A LOT has happened in the last couple of weeks!\n\nSo I forwarded her messages to my ex's brother Fred. He called me immediately and said that he would try to get a hold of his brother as soon as possible. I forgot to say in my earlier post but Bill works as an independent consultant/contractor in IT so it was hard getting a hold of him in his workplace. Frank received a few responses from Bill, just short emails saying he was ok, but Fred wasn't really buying it.\n\nThankfully I hadn't received any more messages from Fiona (I didn't reply to any of her emails so I guess she gave up on me). I didn't think there was much more that anyone could do so just got on with looking after my own family.\n\nMy husband (let's call him Dan) knew that I was worried about my ex, and as a testament to what a great guy he is he set about trying to contact him as they both work in the same field of IT (I know apparently I have a very specialized 'type' lol). Dan is close to his boss and told him about the situation. Dan's boss contacted Bill through Linkedin to set up a Skype \"consult\". Dan's reasoning is that if Fiona is monitoring Bill's emails and social media then this will fly under her radar as she doesn't know Dan's boss and his connection to us. My husband is a sneaky clever bastard.\n\nThey scheduled the call a day later and my husband hopped onto the call as well. He didn't tell me exactly what he said, but the gist of it is that Dan and his boss told Bill that we were all worried about him and that if he needed help to just let us know. Bill broke down and started crying. He felt so helpless and thought that no one cared about him. Turns out she was reading all his emails and deleted all the ones from his family as well as controlling all the finances. She was also physically assaulting him and was too embarrassed to tell anyone (she's just shy of 5 foot, he's 6'4''). Dan and his boss told him to pack his bags and head to the airport and they bought him a one way ticket back home!\n\nBill arrived home a week or so ago and he's doing well. He's staying with his mother and father and Fred has been helping him get back on his feet and handle the legal stuff. Needless to say they are extremely grateful to my husband and his boss and have paid back the cost of the ticket as well as buying Dan and his boss several bottles of very expensive bourbon (which they insisted on, we were happy to cover the ticket but weren't going to argue with them). Dan and I told them that now he's home we were going to take a step back. His family is looking after him now and they don't need our help anymore we'll still keep in touch though and I think we'll always be close to Bill and his family from now on. Fred did tell me that she doesn't want to come back home so we don't have to worry about her turning up on our doorstep.\n\nI don't know how Fiona reacted (she hasn't sent me any emails so I don't think she knows I was involved) or what's going to happen legally because I don't want to be so involved anymore. It's time we focused on our family for a bit because I'M PREGNANT! Couldn't have picked a better man to breed with. Also, Dan's boss let Dan bill the hours of Bill's rescue as \"personal development\" because there are still decent people in the world.\n\n**tl;dr: My instincts were right, Bill was being abused emotionally and physically by his crazy (now ex) wife. My husband and his boss staged an intervention under the guise of work and bought Bill a plane ticket home. Bill's doing fine. He's going to counselling and everyone is giving him lots of support. My husband and I had fun times and now I'm knocked up.**\n\n\n   \n",

I'm so glad guys were proactive because, as you can tell from Bill's reaction and from some of the comments in the original post, it's so easy for male victims of domestic violence to feel too much shame and for others to not take their potential abuse as seriously. Especially when they're in a different hemisphere. I'm so incredibly glad that he narrowly escaped a lifetime of abuse.",
            "I'm so glad you decided to help him. Reading the first post of people saying he can make his own decisions made me so angry, he was being domestically abused and manipulated and they wanted you to turn a blind eye. Thanks for being a good person :)",

Obviously, Fiona's actions have been awful, but it made me happy to see that countered by so many more people working to do good - you, your husband, his boss, Bill's brother... It's really wonderful to see what you all worked together to do to help Bill out. I'm really glad he's away from his ex, and hopefully he'll be able to recover soon from it all with his family's support.",

            "> Even though my original post didn't get a lot of attention...\n\nI thought the goal of /r/relationships was to seek advice on tough situations, which after reading your original post, seems like it got some pretty consistent, squared away feedback. Certainly better advice than I would have offered, since I would have recommended you protect yourself and your family from the drama. Also, the mere mention of FB drama is probably going to make your average redditors click *next*.\n\nThat being said, I want to laud you on your intuition and handling of the situation. By going through your BIL, you helped re-establish contact between the family members while avoiding conflict with the now ex-wife, and helped get the rescue of your ex-BF rolling. Not that many people would be willing to take on additional stress in the midst of a pregnancy, let alone have it also involve your husband in his workplace, albeit, a great guy who saw the concern and the opportunity to help out the guy.  Kudos for being a Mensch.\n\nP. S. Now that you've figured out how you *fell pregnant*, better make sure you find a way to avoid that such that you aren't victimized again. /s",
