        "selftext": "I [F27] moved into my flat in October of last year to take the place of a mutual friend of mine and my new flatmate [F27]. We have a generally great atmosphere in the flat, and both have similar expectations and habits and while we're not 'friends' yet (as in we wouldn't go out for brunch or be each others plus ones for parties) we are very friendly. She seems super normal and level.\n\nWhen the lockdown began (March), my boyfriend [M31] of two years was living with his sister, and his mother (undergoing chemo) who lived alone, needed somewhere to stay where she could be looked after, so she moved into his room and he came to stay with us. My flatmate was totally fine, and we had a proper chat about ground rules etc, but ultimately the flat is huge for two people and she has a kind of granny flat set up in hers. Either way, she gave definite approval. \n\nNow, we three got on great, but never really spent a tonne of time together. We all work from home and spend the occasional evening playing games or whatever, but ultimately we didn't mingle much more than before. My boyfriend, however, cooks every night for the both of us, as a thank you, and so we do now eat together, and my flatmate seemed happy to be included.\n\nIt was great. However, last week, my boyfriend took me aside and told me that while he was in the courtyard hanging out the washing she \"ambushed\" him from behind and gave a huge speech about how she's in love with him, and while she \"respects\" he's with me, she has deep feelings for him, and that she's available if he were single. Oh, and please don't tell OP. She didn't try to kiss him, but tried to hold his hand.... \n\nHe was very anxious and flustered when he was telling me this. The flat atmosphere is VERY awkward now, but as far as she knows, he's not said a word. She's not said anything else to him, but he did mention that she had touched his arm a couple of times as she was walking past recently and it's really gotten under my skin. My BF is also confused because he hasn't spent that much time with her apart from dinner, and never alone. \n\nI spoke to our mutual friend who was shocked, and says she's never done anything like this before, and she'd never known my housemate to have a crush on anyone either. I've not seen her acting strangely in any other ways, and it hasn't outwardly affected how she treats me. We can't move rn because: virus, money etc. How do I deal with this? \n\nTL;DR: my flat mate has told my boyfriend she loves him while he's staying with us, and we can't leave.\n\n(note: edited for typo)",

            "Broooo wtf. As the other comment says, have a serious & long conversation with her. Your boyfriend included. This is extremely inappropriate & it\u2019s obviously affected everyone in the flat. Communicate how it has affected the atmosphere & let her know that she cant be touching up on your boyfriend when he\u2019s yknow, still in a relationship. That\u2019s wrong & disrespectful.",
            "You have to talk to her about it. If you don't, she will see your bf silence on the matter as tacit consent. Nip it in the bud before things go way out of control and she ends up sexually harassing him.",
            "Absolutely confront her. There are two huge issues here. First, she asked your boyfriend to keep this a secret. And second, yeah, what a trash friend and room mate she is. Crushes happen, but for her to confess to your boyfriend, she was legit wanting him to dump you for her. She wasn't just confessing \"if he was single\". She knows he's not single. She was making her move, but got shot down. \nAnd your boyfriend needs to put a stop in the touching etc. \n\nAnd maybe this is going to be unpopular advice, but do not care one bit how uncomfortable it will make everything, her, the house etc. She did that, not you. You're just going to call her out on her trash behaviour.",
            "There is no easy solution. \n\nOption 1: You sit her down and tell her your BF told you everything, and he is super uncomfortable. Tell her that she crossed major boundaries, and you need time apart. No more shared dinners.\n\nOption 2: Even though it's a pandemic. Housing is still a priority, and rentals are still allowed to be shown and what not. Start looking into other affordable housing options. \n\nPersonally I would do both options. I know confrontation is hard and uncomfortable. But what she did was so unbelievably out of line. And touching your BF is so creepy. You will never feel comfortable around her again, so even though you can't move out tomorrow. You should start saving and planning for moving out as soon as possible.",
            "If you say nothing she will believe he never told you. To her, his keeping mum might look like he's entertaining the idea.",
            ">\tWe can't move rn because: virus, money etc. How do I deal with this?\n\nI've been in situations like this and the answer is almost always to move out. If it's impossible now then start saving and planning your move.",
            "Tell her that you know everything and that, while she can't control her feelings, you expect her to behave appropriately and to keep her hands to herself.\n\nEnd conversation.",
            "Living in close quarters it seems like your roommate has seen how your boyfriend treats you and is fantasizing.\n\nI would suggest that you and your bf discuss how you would all be more comfortable, what kind of ground rules would work well while taking into consideration that she is the paying roommate with you so you can't expect her to eat every meal in her room, for example.\n\nWhile you should be cordial, its probably a good idea to discontinue spending time together, however logistically you may want to consider continuing to cook meals or cook a couple times a week to continue to show your appreciation for your bf staying there, while eating seperately.\n\nWhen you all sit down to talk your bf should carry the conversation while sitting close to you and holding your hand to signify his support for you. He should emphasize that her actions hurt you both very much and that while you both don't fault her for her feelings, her expressing herself the way that she did was highly inappropriate. Her actions have broken the trust and friendship that you all were developing and because of that you will need to agree to some ground rules going forward.\n\nYou may end up having to find a way to move if the living situation ends up being untenable. She has already created that rift. Try and use the conversation to de-esculate the situation.",
            "I think you should have a talk with her about how inappropriate her conversation with your bf was. However, that's not going to fix the problem. Anyone who respected you or your relationship wouldn't put you in this position, especially during a time where you can't easily leave the situation. I wouldn't be rude to her, but I think you need to stop being friendly. If she is still touching him after he told he no then it's not going to get better. Come up with an exit strategy.",
            "What did he tell her in response to this speech? If he has not already done so, HE needs to be the one to make it clear that he is not interested in her, and that he told you because he is not going to keep secrets from you.",
            "I think one problem with your approach is that you feel bad that he didn't honor her \"don't tell OP\" and keep a secret. F that. You and he should wear that \"there are no secrets btwn us\" like a badge of honor. It tells her that not only is your relationship strong, but you are a team and she can't break it down from within. A couple years ago, I knew someone who gave me the \"just don't tell your husband\" thing and that quickly got shot down. Nope. Nuh-uh. No thank you.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Maybe if he outwardly shows affection to you in front of her she will get the point? He should stop cooking for everyone for a while and go back to eating separate schedules/in your room. She is really disrespectful to you (and your relationship) so I wouldn't worry about hurting her feelings.",
            "I'm guessing this is a cooped and lonely thing with your bf looking like a tall glass of water in the covid desert. \n\nDoesn't excuse saying anything to your bf but I wonder if this would ever have happened if she was able to get out easily - for drinks.",
            "If you don't talk, all three of you, it's probably not going to make things more awkward than they already are.\nThe roommate knows that your bf has told you what she said.  For someone in his position, there's only two options, and they are mutually exclusive.  He's not reciprocated her feelings, so I don't see how she would think he's kept it to himself, this would be particularly unlikely from a woman's perspective.\nI know this will be unpopular, because on Reddit you're supposed to always be 100% honest, but I would propose that the three of you talk, and mention the circumstances of being in quarantine together/cabin fever and not seeing other people, because this is really the only way to give your roommate a face-saving way to retreat back to the dynamic the way it was before with the three of you.\nNormally, I would say move out, be mad at her, both of you express your feelings to her, etc, but I would urge you to think more in terms of the dynamic you want to create in the household, and less in terms of offloading all of your feelings onto her.  She's not going to steal your bf.  If you feel sad about it, this may be a way to rebuke her without lashing out. \n\nI think this might be the best way to be honest with each other, and move forward in the most peaceful way possible, even if it's not perfect.  Hopefully I am reading your post right, is your goal to try and make the dynamics in the house as unawkward as possible?  What does your bf want to do about it if anything?",
            "GIRL. Why is he worried about her \u201csecret\u201d as if she confided about a crush at school?\nShe LITERALLY decided it\u2019s ok to try to sabotage your relationship, and she\u2019s hoping his loyalties are with HER?! Over his own gf?! Lol what? What a deluded woman.\n\nHow are you not livid at her? How has he not said \u201cfuck that, I\u2019m telling my gf, and we are having a discussion about boundaries?\u201d Or at least a \u201cif you touch my arm one more time unprompted, we are leaving\u201d? \n\nI am shocked that he is tiptoeing around her, instead of taking charge and putting her back in her lane. It\u2019s great that he told you, good-bf props there. But that doesn\u2019t stop the issue, as it solves literally nothing.",
            "You should definitely confront her about this. If she thinks he's willing to keep this a secret from you then she'll think she can break you up.",
            ">> I've not seen her acting strangely in any other ways, and it hasn't outwardly affected how she treats me. \n\nThat's because she's hoping your boyfriend will reciprocate her feelings with action. Her ability to act completely normal around you despite being a selfish backstabber speaks to her ability to be extremely manipulative. \n\n>> gave a huge speech about how she's in love with him, and while she \"respects\" he's with me, she has deep feelings for him, and that she's available if he were single. Oh, and please don't tell OP. \n\nShe has zero respect for you. She thinks that the connection she has with your boyfriend is mutual and their relationship is special. \n\n>> My boyfriend, however, cooks every night for the both of us, as a thank you, and so we do now eat together, and my flatmate seemed happy to be included.\n\n>> but he did mention that she had touched his arm a couple of times as she was walking past recently and it's really gotten under my skin. \n\n>> How do I deal with this?\n\nFrom here on out, your boyfriend should not make dinner for the three of you. When she brushes past him, he needs to say, \"Stop touching me.\" Being colder towards her will encourage her to drop her delusional fantasy. Also have a conversation with her where you tell her that you are shocked at her betrayal and the two of you now she thinks she's creepy as hell. She does not have a chance with your boyfriend and your friendship with her is over. Things are already awkward so there's no pretending that this didn't happen. This is her fault entirely. She can sit with the discomfort.",
            "Well, only thing to do to make it less awkward is talk to her, or someone move out.\n\nBut what I heard was your BF saying that she professed her love to him and acts flirtatious with him.\n\nWhat I did not hear is where your BF shut her down and assured her to stop her inappropriate actions.",
            "Feelings happen, nothing wrong there. But to act on those feelings, given the circumstances. That's not cool on her part.  I think the best way to deal with this is you trust your boyfriend to make it clear that he isn't interested, and you trust your friend to back off.  If she doesn't back off then you talk to her about it, tell her you are stepping back from your friendship until she can keep her feelings under control.",
            "Talk to her about it and when you do post an update about it please.",
            "This seems to be happening a lot during quarantine.  This is like the 3rd post I've seen about something like this.  Maybe people are confusing regular conversation and dinner for huge deep feelings because they have nothing to compare it to pre quarantine.",
            "Welp i suppose she never claimed to be your friend",
            "The seemingly never ending quarantine lockdown isolation is causing people a lot of loneliness and is  triggering emotional issues. It\u2019s probably especially hard to be single but sheltering with a romantic couple. \n\nThat said, it\u2019s still inappropriate to proposition your roommate\u2019s boyfriend. \n \nOP might calmly say \u201cHey, it\u2019s probably time for us all to talk about how this living situation is going. Has living with a couple become uncomfortable for you?  Should we make other living arrangements?\u201d\n\nIf she denies there\u2019s a problem, then matter of factly bring up her declaration of love for your partner. You are sorry that she feels that way since you and he are in a committed relationship.  It\u2019s probably hard to be around this when it\u2019s impossible to get out and meet new people.  You and bf both appreciate your letting him live here, but you don\u2019t want to cause a problem. \n\nJust see how she responds. She might sheepishly apologize. In the meantime, explore your options.",
            "Sounds like a crush. Best thing in my view would be to have boyfriend out of her way for a month to let her urges cool down. \n\n\nWhat he\u2019s doing (helping around the flat/cooking/working) are probably all what she wants in a future partner. It\u2019s not \u201chim\u201d she wants, it\u2019s a man LIKE him.",
            "Ok this may be a little wild, but perhaps having a conversation all three of you, like mature adults?",
            "As an experienced suggestion goes; I (32M) would have re-constructed the reality of things....minds wander and close during lock down, people get.....weiiiiirrrrduh. \nI said \u201cyou\u2019re not in love with me\u201d your infatuation has replaced your logic and you\u2019ve lost your grip of actuality. \nI included my fianc\u00e9 and addressed both lady\u2019s feelings and established respect immediately. I didn\u2019t thank her or take the sympathy route, just a respectable slap \ud83d\udc4b of reality. It came from me, however instead of turning her dreamlike state of delusion into a nightmare and having a hostile women \u201ccornered\u201d like a staged intervention. I spoke directly, and authoritatively to a point where \u201cwe figured things out/through\u201d she later apologized and thanked me for understanding something she found crazy later on and now found someone who does those things she admires in our daily routines. She found what she wanted in a partner but didn\u2019t know how to express those emotions, it was all new and fascinating and again \u201cundisciplined thoughts of delusional progressives\u201d\nI\u2019d have your man, speak directly. Have this moment work for you, AND her. Save yourself from the drama and work through it like adults. Cuz if you can\u2019t be diplomatic or have him overcome his own anxieties with this sorta stuff, your setting yourself up to future anguish and escapades of failure. It can take a wrong turn on your relationship also, so trust me on this and make a plan with him to set her straight. She might even thank you for it and do something impossibly helpful to your lives. Cheers and sending good vibes to y\u2019all!",

            "It sounds like she\u2019s created a fantasy world and being cooped up isn\u2019t helping. Y\u2019all probably just need to take a break from each other. Put some kind of separation between her and him. Give her time to come back to reality \ud83d\ude05",
            "if someone had been cooking me dinner this whole time, i'd be straight up in love with them, too. god damn. \n\nbut i would keep it to myself if that person were in a relationship. :( tell her you know. tell her she's going to deal with those feelings on her own from now on. and, also, probably ask her to make her own food from now on. it's NOT one big happy family. she made it awkward, return to sender.",

            "Your roommate messed up by not being able to keep it in but also try to take into account that being quarantined in lockdown for months on end with little to no physical human interaction outside your flat leads people to feel certain things or act in certain ways that they would not in normal circumstances. However, as another poster noted if the sexes in this scenario were reversed (Male approaching Female ) then it would be a certain problem and in light of this, it should be not taken lightly. If the sexes were reversed it would be understandable for your partner to feel intimidated and even scared being left in the house with your roommate.  I would not let it slide at all but still appreciate the perspective that your roommate may have been driven to act in this way because of circumstances and if there was no lockdown things may have been different.",
            "I don\u2019t know what it is but cooking dinner everyday for the ladies does it every time. Unfortunately, it worked a little too well in this case.",

            "Why don't y'all act like adults and give it to her straight up? She can move out or get a life of her own.",
            "I would suggest just not mentioning it, and avoiding her as much as possible / stop all shared activities.\n\nMaybe she's just had a COVID-related extreme lapse in judgement.\n\nIf she ever mentions it again to him, you should both tell her bluntly that it's not reciprocated and inappropriate, and pray you can move out soon.",

Maybe heal your relationship and be able to continue living together, but maybe torch things so completely you must move out right away.\n\nb) Not communicate with her.  Stay totally silent and hope that now that she's expressed herself and been told no whatever temporary idiocy had taken over will pass.  Probably lowkey mistrust and resent her forever, but maybe create an atmosphere of detente in the house you can live with until you can get the money to move out- but I would start saving/having an emergency plan now, because I think there's every chance the truce won't hold.",
            "I don\u2019t think a conversation cuts it here. There\u2019s no two ways about it, someone has to go.

The advances are frustrating but having a conversation with someone that irrational and frankly, childish, is going to end up causing someone to move out. Id suggest at least waiting until the pandemic has subsided but thats your call. Make sure to listen to your boyfriend and what he's comfortable with, seems like a keeper.",

Look I\u2019m going to be blunt here, it\u2019s not going to happen as I\u2019m not attracted to you and I love OP. I told her about what you\u2019ve said as there\u2019s no secrets between she and I. It makes me incredibly uncomfortable when you touch me and it needs to stop, I\u2019m not interested and never will be.  I\u2019ve been cooking each night as my way to say thank you, but from now on OP and I think it\u2019d be best if you don\u2019t eat with us anymore. I will still make enough food for you, which you can either take and eat in your room/living room or eat after we\u2019ve finished.",
            "Kudos to your boyfriend for telling you. I think he handled it really well at the time - he said he wasn\u2019t interested and probably didn\u2019t escalate it because he hoped she would drop it and everything would go back to normal. And he straight up told you what happened. That\u2019s relationship goals! \n\nThe big problem is, she\u2019s escalated it. She\u2019s continued flirting, being inappropriate. I think you should definitely look to move out, but in the mean time your boyfriend needs to speak with her and tell her to stop her actions and I think he should do it alone. Some girls are crazy and you never know, if you\u2019re there she might take it that you\u2019re the bad guy stopping him from really saying what he wants to say, that he\u2019s under some form of duress.",

            "You can choose whether or not you want to get involved. If you do, one of you will have to move out cause it will be too awkward or uncomfortable to stay together. Either way, the best way to handle this is for your boyfriend to make it very clear to your roommate that he is not interested in her, he loves you, and there is zero chance that you guys will break up and he does not want that now or ever. Only he can make it clear to her and have her back off. Whether or not you get involved this is his place to draw a strong line and nip her feelings in the bud.",
            "> How do I deal with this? \n\nCongratulate yourself on not being as spectacularly unwise as your flatmate. I can't think what possessed her to do this in the middle of lockdown when she is in a living situation where she is outnumbered.\n\nObviously after lockdown eases it sounds like you are going to have to reconsider this living situation, money or not.",
            "I do agree with all the advice about talking to her about this. I wouldn't use the terms 'confront' though. I think you have to take a position that respects she might be having some issues, before you get angry. \n\nYou are in the better situation. Your boyfriend told you immediately. He feels uncomfortable. So you can talk to her without anger and just tell her that it was inappropriate, and that you are willing to forget it if she apologies and recognises what she has done. Offer your ear as a friend. Is everything ok with her? Why would she think this was ok?\n\nBe the bigger person and you can probably salvage a comfortable house. 'Confront' her with anger and you are probably going to make things worse, or at the very least, force her to leave.",

Once he\u2019s safe you can decide if you want to come up with a story (\u201cwent to stay with a friend who\u2019s in a bad spot emotionally\u201d) or just outright tell her that he was made to feel uncomfortable by her continued advances and thought it might be best to remove himself from the situation.\n\nI know this sounds like a pain in the ass but honestly BF shouldn\u2019t be made to put up with harassment, which is what this is.

Or rather, if she didn\u2019t get it the first time she likely won\u2019t get it upon being repeated. \n\nOP, imagine if the roles were reversed: you moved in with BF and his male roommate, and said roommate made unwanted advances towards you that continued after you told him \u201cno.\u201d Freaky, right? And while the threat level might not be exactly the same in both situations, having to live under those conditions without any relief in sight can be incredibly damaging to a person\u2019s mental health. Things are too stressful in general right now without you both having to deal with this as well. I\u2019m so sorry she\u2019s disrespected your growing friendship this way and mistaken your and BF\u2019s kindness for weakness. But it sounds like she\u2019s shown you who she is, so believe it. And get out.",
            "You do what anyone else would in a situation like that. Talk to the flatmate. Seriously, I wouldn't come to Reddit unless you have exhausted all other methods of resolution because we aren't exactly the most insightful bunch of people. It's more mob mentality. But, whatever, that's my opinion. Simple problems like this (because let's face it, it is pretty basic) just resolves by talking to the person you have an issue with. Or someone who is close to them to help break the tension. \n\nAs for her behaviour, you can't really stop her from doing it permanently but again, you can address it in the conversation you should have with her.\n\nMaybe she's just feeling envious of your relationship as she's not had anyone (from the knowledge you have shared in the post) and although this is an assumption, it's probably just something she sees and wants without understanding your relationship to one another fully. Perhaps. \n\nEither way, you aren't going to get your answers from her and what's going on simply by asking some strangers online since we aren't all phycologists.",
            "First, you and your boyfriend decide how much time you want and are comfortable spending around her. Would you like to stop eating dinner with her? Would you like to stop spending social time with her? You really can't have things go back to the way they were before, so you have to figure out what will make life more livable for you, and then stick with that.\n\nNow, this depends on your rent agreement and whether or not she can kick one of you out, but if I were you, I would have a flat meeting and get everything out in the open. But that might not be something that you are comfortable with, since you have to keep living with this person, and that's fine, *but* it has to be a choice you make as a couple, *and* someone has to tell her to stop crossing your boyfriend's boundaries, and he doesn't seem to be able to do that, so I think it's going to have to be you. If you decide to have a house meeting, you, as a couple, tell her that you know and that your boyfriend is uncomfortable with her touching his arm. I'm sure she hasn't been trying to make either of you distressed, but that's the impact she has had. She chose to deal with her feelings by going behind your back and putting him in a terrible position, and it's only fair that she deal with the fallout. She created this stress, but only the two of you, particularly your boyfriend, are feeling it. How is that ok? I would put this all at her feet and tell her the steps the two of you will be taking (that you decided earlier) to make your living arrangement more bearable. You don't have to attack her or fight with her. Just tell her how it is. She chose to change the dynamic unilaterally, so the two of you have the right to shift it again. Fair is fair.",

            "Here\u2019s my bet.   You confront the housemate, and she\u2019ll say he came onto her and is just lying to cover his tracks when she rejected him.  \n\nThe longer you leave this the more time an alternative story has to be formed.",

            "My personal advice is first to talk to your boyfriend, would he be more comfortable confronting her on his own, together, or having you confront her on your own? Then depending on which it needs to be discussed that, yes, he told you and he did so right away. It needs to be stated again that he is not interested and she needs to stop touching him, whether it's accidental or not it is making him uncomfortable. I would also say that acting on her feelings while knowing he is in a relationship is very inappropriate and when he said he isn't interested he meant it. Stop eating together. At the end of clearing all this up and stating your and your boyfriend's boundaries, tell her that you and he will be looking for elsewhere to live.   Good luck. I hope you find somewhere soon.",
            "You gotta talk to your boyfriend, why the hell didn't he say anything? He needs to man the fuck up. He probably liked the attention because no normal person would just stay silent at that.",
            "To me you have two choices:\n\n1) you ignore the dancing elephant in the room and everyone pretends everything is normal.  Along with that your boyfriend says  to her \"given what you told me I am not comfortable AT ALL being touched by you so even a touch on the arm is going to make me unhappy.  This is probably madness from all being locked in together but I heed you to give me some distance since what you told me has made me very uncomfortable\".  Then once he's said that you all fake it and pretend nothing happened.\n\n2) you call an apartment meeting.  He tells her that you are his partner and concealing things from you felt wrong to him.  Then you all agree to be friendly but at the same time keep at a distance.  That means no hanging out together.  Once again you point out that it's probably shut-in, covid-19 madness and at some point it will all be over.\n\nNeither option is perfect and given that it seems your boyfriend is there based on her goodwill it makes it especially challenging.",

I'd be banging on her door HARD with my boyfriend demanding she explain her little \"crush\" and humiliate her into never trying that shit again. People take passiveness as weakness or acceptance by the way. Not all people. But a lot see it as \"keep going you got a green light!\"",
            "You need to be up front with her. Letting her know that you and your boyfriend will not keep secrets from each other is a good place to start to lay some personal boundaries with her.",

You should also find a new roomate and either you should move after this, or she should move. Im surprised you havent confronted her yet, ive had a girl do this before and nothing made it better until i said something.",

            "What a horrible situation for both of you to be in. \n\nI would say you will have to talk to her because she is your roomie. I dont think your bf needs to he directly involved in the talk but if she chooses to go up to him and ask why he told you, that is when he can directly involve himself and say \"because I love OP\". Or if she tries to make a move again, he can shut her down and say \"that makes me uncomfortable. Dont touch me again\". \n\nAs for you, you will have to sit her down and tell her he told you what happened. That you thought everyone was on the same page of platonic feelings but because she crossed the line on making a move at him, you and your partner no longer feel comfortable being around her in group settings. She can still do whatever she wants around the house by herself but as far as eating together and other group activity, it will no longer continue because you and bf are uncomfortable with what she has done. Then closing off with you hope everyone can live amicably/cordially with each other. \n\nThen minimize contact with her because I honestly wouldnt trust her anymore after she showed such disrespect to your relationship. Having a crush is fine but acting on it is a whole new level of actually wanting something to happen. \n\nIdk if she'll start telling tall tales of being outcasted or not but something to think of too. And shut down if she tries to blame yall for making her feel uncomfortable in the house. She is the one who created it.",

As far as moving out goes, would it be possible to find a small short term (6 month) place? Or find a room available for rent that would allow a couple to move in? Understandably the pandemic has fucked with finances, just seeing if there is even a small opportunity. It would seem best in order for you and your partner to live somewhere comfortably until things settle. From reading your text, it doesnt seem your American so I'm not fully aware of the options you may or may not have. \n\n2. I can't help but think this- you and your mutual friend both agree it was an odd thing for her to do. Out of character right? This doesn't change the fact that she has feelings for your partner nor that she confronted him behind your back. But- with everything going on and people becoming more isolated from the world, could it be that shes experiencing some sort of \"episode\"? Maybe became depressed and has affected her way of thinking, thus making some bad decisions? This is just what I'm thinking since it's become apparent that she is not normally like this.",

If she makes another move, look at other living arrangements.",

Another friend of his also crossed some boundaries and he did not know what to do... \n\nI think there are reactions we can hope for, but think it is unreasonable for people to give the input that he should have reacted in a certain way.

            "Reading how odd it is that they never spent much, if any, alone time together for her to actually develop genuine, serious feelings for him (even if fostering them while he is in a relationship is shitty, and definitely telling him is), it makes me curious about what's going on with her. Especially since you all are well out of your teens.\n\nI would maybe wonder if she is having some sort of mental health episode. I'm just a guy on a reddit smokin a spliff right now.... but this sounds a little like hypomania to me, or something similar.\n\nI would suggest attempting to understand if something like this is at play. It doesn't excuse the behavior, and she would still need to make amends for it, but it would also not make it entirely her fault or mean that she's a trash person. I have no idea what you three are going through, but I hope you and your bf are able to find a wonderful place alone together soon.",

Try remaining silent and appearing ignorant; get your boyfriend to politely but firmly establish boundaries and tell her he does not reciprocate her feelings, he is in love with you, he does not appreciate you touching him, etc, and if this continues, he will be forced to inform you and then things will get more awkward. Try this approach first imo.",

I've been back to her grave three times and he's been there every time. Just sitting there. The first two times I left, because I didn't want to bother him, but yesterday I went over and talked to him. We went to a bar and talked some more.\n\nI'm not going to pretend to know the guy, I had only talked to him 5 or 6 times prior to this. But he seems like the type of guy who keeps to himself, with not too many friends. He's also a bit of a nerd. He reminds me of myself actually, which is part of the reason I feel the need to help in some way. When we were at the bar he said a few somewhat alarming things , but these two stuck out: \"she was all I had... I have nothing left\" and \"I'm lost without her.\"\n\nI suggested therapy, told him that it's helped me in the past, but he had no interest in it. I offered to let him stay at my house, I can't imagine its very nice sleeping in the apartment that she died in, but he declined. I'm not really sure what to do. He said things that made me think he might commit suicide, but I don't know him that well so I can't be sure. He just seemed so gloomy. Advice is appreciated.\n   \n**tl;dr**:Daughter [F20] died.

            "Find a local grief support group and go to the next meeting and bring him. Tell him you're going to try it just once, but want him to come along as moral support for *you*. Edit: thank you for the GOLD! And OP, so sorry for your loss.",
            "This is actually something I can contribute to, and I hope I can be helpful. At 34, I'm older than either your daughter or her BF, but I have some experience in this. Three years ago, my girlfriend died after 15 months fighting leukaemia. I already got on really well with her family, but we became really close during the whole ordeal. My then-girlfriend and I both lived in the UK (having met here), but are/were both Canadian, and her family still lived there. When she was diagnosed, they both spent as much time over here as they could, and at the end basically lived here full-time. My late-GF and I were long-distance, and I would usually come up on alternating weeks, again more often near the end. We all lived at my girlfriend's flat, and that, plus the reality of the situation, brought us all together.\n\nIt was no surprise when she passed, as we'd all known it was coming for a few months. But that didn't lessen the effect. Her parents stuck around for a few weeks after, until the memorial was done, then had to go back to Canada.\n\nSince then, her mother and I have kept in touch, and I periodically speak with her father and routinely post things back and forth on Facebook with her brother. He mother has outright told me, as well a shown me, that she considers me a son-in-law in everything but name. I'm part of their family and they're part of mine.\n\nYour daughter's boyfriend is in a very fucked up place. His world is turned around and being 20 years old will only magnify that and the importance of everything. The reality is that he will eventually meet someone else, and he will love again; he's 20, of course he will. But there is no chance that he can see that. So, if I could give you a recommendation, I would say that you just need to be there for him. Think of him like the son of your best friend. Someone you know, and care for, but don't see every day. Let him know that you're there for a shoulder to cry on or for a drink. Commiserate and share stories of your daughter and the great times they had together and you did with her. You will both have memories and talking about them can help you both remember the happy times.\n\nI wouldn't push for things like therapy, meeting new friends or \"don't worry, you're young, you'll be OK/love again\" etc. If you feel comfortable helping him find somewhere else to live, or putting him up on your couch for a few weeks, that might not be a bad idea, but don't push it too hard. When you're that age, \"I have nothing left\" is an easy place to go to. Just be there and give him a sense of normalcy and regular life when you can, but don't back away from what happened. Let him know that you guys share a tragedy-when my late GF died, I felt guilty for awhile because I felt like I was imposing on her parents' grief and tragedy-they had known her for 32 years, we'd only been dating for 3.5. But they acknowledged and recognised my pain, and they validated that it was serious and real and deserving. We shared the loss together, spoke openly about both the loss and the love we had for her. And that made it a lot easier to get through.\n\nFeel free to PM me at any point if you want, I'm happy to share more or go over specifics. And though I realise first-hand how empty a thing this is to say, I am so sorry for what you've gone through, and for your loss.",
            "I'm so, so sorry for your loss. This must be a very trying time for you and your wife.\n\nAs I am sure you and your wife have noticed, it is a lot easier to overcome grief when you have someone to share with, but this young man has lost the partner who he would normally have shared his grief with. It is very noble of you to want to try to guide him through his grief. But considering you don't know him well, I doubt there is much you can personally do for him except continue to be pleasant with him when you happen to see him, and try to keep in touch and talk to him if he is willing. If you know how to contact his parents, or if you know any of your daughter's close friends who might also be close with him, the best thing you can do is to inform them of the sentiments he expressed to you and that you are worried about his mental health and ask them to keep an eye on him and check in with him to make sure he is safe.",
            "First, I'm very sorry for your loss.  It must be devastating to lose a child.  I think your empathy for this kid is amazing, given what you are going through.  But you are picking up on something important - you are equipped with the life experience to know that this phase of deep grief will pass.  There will always be a scar on your heart, but the wound will stop bleeding.  He seems to be drowning in it, with no light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nCan you contact his family as well?  Do you know any of the people in their circle of friends?  Reach out and let everyone know of your concerns.\n\nEven if you are overreacting, it is incumbent on you to alert those around him that he might be suicidal.  He should definitely be in therapy, even if it is a local church or YMCA/JCC Bereavement Support Group.  Make some phone calls, offer to go with him - you would benefit from it yourself.  He may be too grief-stricken to take action.\n\n**Take action.  You'd never forgive yourself if you said/did nothing and then something awful happened.  Good luck.**",
            "My gf died when she was 21 and I was 26. What helped me the most was the family continuing to include me in their life. They made me feel like part of their family. They'd have me over for dinner on random nights, and I'd even spend thanksgiving with them and go to their lake house a couple times. I think it helped them as much as it helped me.\n\nBut I really didn't know how to grieve and would spend all day thinking like \"what do I do now?\"...Not a deep philosophical question but literally what do I do today/tonight? Passing time became incredibly difficult, so every time anyone included me in anything was greatly appreciated. I feared having to go home after work with nothing to do, knowing I'd be alone with my thoughts all night. She committed suicide, so it was impossible not to think about suicide. Not doing it myself, but just that it exists, and it's scary. Unlike other causes of death, you can't sweep that dark thought under the rug. It's right in your face. So just being around people I know was helpful. Being with her family was doubly helpful because I could kinda see how they were grieving and take cues and learn from them. ",
            "I'm so sorry, I can't begin to imagine.\n\nAs to what you can do... I guess just keep talking to him and giving him someone to talk to.  Maybe invite him over for dinner or something, you all have a chance to talk about your daughter/his girlfriend and at least you know he's eating one decent meal that day.  It's tough, you've got your own grief and your wife's grief and now you're taking on helping with someone else's as well... that's true grace.\n\nBy the way, remember the rule of the oxygen masks and if he is going down a bad way and it's exacerbating your grief then call his family or a mental health team in.  ",
            "I dont have any advice, but I just wanted to say that: *your* daughter died and you're worried about how her boyfriend is coping? You're a great person. The fact that this is even on your radar at this moment is a masterpiece of understanding and empathy. ",
            "...Your daughter died and you're worried about her bf. You left her grave to let him grieve. For what it's worth, you're a really fucking good person.",
            "First of all, I am sorry for your loss.\n\nSecond of all, you sound like a phenomenal human being for caring about your daughter's boyfriend. He sounds like he needs professional help as well as someone just physically being there. If you and your wife are comfortable with the idea, maybe have a weekly coffee/dinner/whatever with him and just talk about how you are all doing and/or your favorite memories of your daughter. I think one of the worst part about losing someone you love is that it makes you feel incredibly isolated and alone- maybe he needs people around him that know just how great of a person your daughter was so they can understand how profound his grief is. \n\nSince you said he's like you, maybe connect on stuff you guys have in common so your relationship isn't revolving around death. If you're into Star Wars, maybe talk about the new Star Wars movie? If you're into D&D and are going to have a game night with people, maybe invite him? \n\nThat being said, I think I would still every now and again bring up therapy. Perhaps not in \"you should do it\" sort of way, but you heard about a therapy group and you might try it out. That way, he is always reminded of the option. \n\nYou're a good dad, OP. Again, I'm sorry for your loss. ",
            "When I was 19, a girl I was very close to died in a car accident. Her brother is still one of my two best friends (I'm almost 40 now). She and I had dated all through high school (for me).\n\nI remember at the visitation walking to see her in the casket and her dad was there, greeting everyone as usual. When I got to him I broke down. It's hard for me to write about now. I loved her so much and still do.\n\nAnyway he basically held me up. I think he was the first adult to give me a hug during that time. My father was absent. My step-father was a drug addict. He showed me what a real man is. \n\nI have two daughters now (4 and 5) and a wife I love dearly. I'll always remember how even though his only daughter was in that casket, for that moment he put that aside and loved me as much as anyone ever had. That memory has served me all through my life of what it means to be a man and servant of God.\n\nPeace and Grace to you.",
            "I'm pretty sure this is too late to get any attention, but all I care about is that you read this, OP. My wife's boyfriend before we met and married was killed in an unexpected altercation. Incidentally, I met her because her boyfriend was the brother of my best friend from high school. I met her about 5 months after he passed, and was able to see the good and the bad with how his family treated her. In addition I have history working as a hospital chaplain and have been with people during the grieving process and I hope I can give some insight.\n\n1. Take care of yourself and get your own therapy. My wife worried (and still mentions whenever the topic comes up) about their health a great deal as they really never coped properly. It is like the airplane oxygen masks - take care of yourself first or you will be in no real position to help others. I also believe that spiritual guidance is a very important part of processing tragedy, although some will inevitably disagree. Also, most counselors will tell you that the loss of a child is one of the most emotionally significant loss that can happen. I am touched by your care for your daughter's boyfriend, and please let that wholesome desire to give you energy to help him, but don't let that be a distraction for your own healing. \n\n2. Let him cope on his own terms. Offer advice and encouragement, but remember that everyone copes differently. Mistakes will be made, but it is a process. Your encouragement of therapy is a very good idea. \n\n3. Don't guilt him to stay near you. This is a big one, and it isn't always intentional. \"Misery loves company\" is very true. People commiserate over tragedy, and that is very acceptable for a time, but there comes a point where there needs to be a break. Right now, things are still fresh, so I personally believe that your mutual company is very acceptable. As time goes on though, if you see that he sticks around a little too much, it is best in the long run to find yourself occupied if he wants to visit. Subtle encouragement for him to branch out to help move through the pain is crucial - if that becomes an issue. \n\nPeople grieve in just about as many ways as there are people to grieve, so things will always be different. For the most part, there are no right or wrong ways to grieve. Keeping your eyes on taking things one day at a time and ensuring that you have a good support system for yourself will do wonders. And as for your daughter's boyfriend, just offer an ear and a hug whenever he needs it, and encourage him to get support too, and if any codependent relationship forms, address it tactfully when you see it.\n\nMy deepest prayers for you, your wife, family, and your daughter's boyfriend. \n\n[Edit - Obviously, follow the advice given here about the potentially suicidal comments. I didn't make that clear. If he doesn't have a support system, he needs one asap if he is in that frame of mind. Ask for his parents or friends and get them in touch.]",
            "I'm sorry for your loss, I would recommend that maybe yoh keep talking to him, tell him that you're available to talk to him when he needs to, and just be that friend that he needs right now, maybe also check up on him every few days.",
            "I'm so sorry for your loss, my heart aches for you. \n\n\nWhile I don't have any advice to offer, I just wanted come here and say that you sound like\na very selfless individual. Your daughter passes away, and you're wondering what you can do for her boyfriend whom you've only met a handful of times? The world seriously needs more people like you. \n\nMy condolences to you and your family.",
            "Grief counciling would be the best bet. \n\nShort of that then remembering the times you shared with your daughter (keeping her memory alive) I find is a helpful part of dealing with it, though everybody is different. It hurts when it is so raw but as time goes on the pain dims and those memories make you smile.\n\nI personally believe the best thing you can do for anybody who leaves your life is to find happiness and remember them.\n\n*internet hug*\n",
            "Just reading the title of this post brought tears to my eyes. For a father who's daughter was just killed, to be going through that, and still want to look after her boyfriend. Faith in humanity restored man. ",
            "I am 29 and have been around my fair share of death from a very young age. \n\nWhen i was 8, I went to the museum on a school trip and my best friend had an aneurysm while we were waiting in mine to go in, just collapsed right there and was instantly gone.  I thought she fainted.  The next morning i was walking to school and her mother and my mother stopped me together to tell me she was gone, and i collapsed in a heap. \n\nAfter her parents initial grieving process, they came over to my house with a gift wrapped.  They were photos of Andrea on the street we used to play on.  I was touched at such a young age.  In my mind, her parents should want to be \"selfish\" and hold on to these keepsakes for themselves.  They pulled away from their own grief and gave to a young girl such precious items.  I still have the picture of that blonde 8 year old on her bicycle giving the peace sign. \n\nThen my cousin passed a couple years later.  I was about 11 and she was about 23 and died of cancer.  My aunt (who is ridiculously superstitious) and uncle had given me a classic troll doll that belonged to my cousin,witch i knew probably meant more to my aunt.  I also still have the dress i wore as a flower girl in her wedding. \n\nLastly, and probably the most difficult (and relatable to your situation) was a couple years ago.  I dated a man for about 1.5 years and he broke up with me without telling me he had cancer.  When i found out about 2 months later, i was stunned.  He was estranged from his family and i took on the role of his caretaker. For over a year i was by his side while he withered away.  I provided all his meals, some money, laughter and tears.  His family had virtually no presence until his last 2 months in hospice, at which point they patted me on the head and said\"we'll take it from here\". Then he was gone.  They invited me to his private burial and offered to drive me but then they stood me up and left me waiting at a grocery store in the rain, crying and alone. \n\nWhat i was feeling was that i was the only one that cared about him that way.  I felt that he was taken from me, and nobody else.  Nobody could feel the sense of loss that i did.  My family and friends gave support, but nobody really understood my pain.  I went to grief counseling, and is a great recommendation for him, but it still wasnt enough.  I walked away from the 6 weeks of counseling OK, i know i will get through the pain, but it doesn't take away that he's gone. 2.5 years later it still hurts. \n\nFrom my point of view, i think the suggestions of going to counseling (with him or without him) are great.  Give him something tangible from her.  A lock of hair, a few photographs from childhood to adulthood, or something important to her.  Also, yes there is a grave, but maybe plant a tree in her honour.  Something that grows and breathes life, that symbolises her (maybe her favourite flower) that he can visit.  New life and new beginnings need to grow from the ashes, like a phoenix.  These tangible pieces give us a party of someone to hold onto in grief.  And know that the grief never really goes away.  It becomes manageable, but those parts of us get buried with them.  It's just about finding a new normal to live with.  There is hope,and there will be love again. ",
            "Give him a hug. I'm sure it would help you both at least a little. I know it sounds simplistic, but I think it could go far in showing him that you're safe to open up to. Next time you see him, hug him. Especially if it's at her grave again.",
            "First off I am so sorry for your loss. \nI read this sub but am never inclined to comment. However, I lost my little brother when he was 20 and his girlfriend was 18 or 19 at the time. She was an absolute wreck. Our approach was to make her a part of our family. My older brother and I were both out of the house but made sure to keep in touch with her and my parents had her over all the time. Do you know his parents? I feel like that was a huge thing for my parents because they were able to talk with her parents often and make sure she was OK. I would highly recommend you get to know them. As others have suggested, please make sure to use your resources if needed. I'm sorry if this is jumbled I just wanted you to know that others have been there too. You're not alone. Please PM me so we can talk more. ",
            "Connect with him and show that you recognize how important they were to each other. What I wanted most from my boyfriends mom when he died was to be accepted and to be able to share in the pain together. I felt like since I was not very close with the family that I didn't deserve to be so sad and that made it really hard to cope sometimes, though she did speak to me about him several times. I wanted to exchange stories for why we loved him so much and remind each other of what an amazing person he was. That's a perspective that he wouldn't have seen and it can help with the process. When my boyfriend died I shed many happy tears when I got to exchange a few stories about how weird and funny he was with his mom, I learned things I didn't know about him and somehow that made the grieving process less tragic.",
            "I can't really add anything to what others have said. But I'm terribly sorry for your loss, losing any family member is tragic, You're a good man for thinking of others at this time. ",
            "Some very simple things you can do are invite him to dinner, or go see a movie, or something like that.  Something to let him know he's not alone and give him an invitation to talk if he so desires, without pressure.  Since he is drawn to her grave, you could suggest going together to get flowers or some other token to leave at the cemetary.  You're a very kind and empathetic person for reaching out to him at this time.  \n\nI don't know if you've been able to go through your daughter's things yet, but when you do, it might be nice to invite him to help or to gift him some of her belongings that were significant to the relationship (if he gave her any gifts, pictures, etc.) or otherwise serve as reminders.  Something to remember her by and show that you know he's hurting too.\n\nI know I can't understand your situation, but a mentor of mine lost his daughter to cancer just a few weeks ago as well.  He's found being open about it, talking freely and without embarrassment to anyone who expresses their sympathies, to be very cathartic.  Often what grieving people need most is the ability to talk without being judged, or even comforted, as comfort can be stifling in its own right.  You are in a good position to be that kind of listener for him if you have the emotional energy for it.  It's understandable if you don't right now.",
            "First, I'm so sorry for your loss. I don't know what it's like to lose a child, chances are I won't, but my aunt and late uncle lost their son at 16 when he was hit by a car in 2000, so I can imagine.\n\nSecond....shit. He reminds me of me in so many ways. Keep reaching out. Invite him to family functions. Whether it's a 4th of July barbecue or watching the NBA Finals or what, help him remember he's not alone. Grab coffee. The two of you can help each other remember what your daughter did, who she was in life. That's way healthier than keeping vigil over her grave and refusing to move on.\n\nBut don't force him, especially so early in the grieving process. When I lost my father, I stayed in California for the memorial, flew home to Baltimore and then went right back to my internship, my work, school and it wasn't until winter break when I took a trip to Japan and actually cleared my head. Just let him know you're there for him when he's ready.",
            "I think maybe it would be good to address what you think your daughter would want for him at this point. While you do not know him, you do know your daughter and the kind of life she would want the people she loves to lead. There is time for grief but he seems to be consumed by it. Perhaps he needs a gentle reminder that there are things he does have to live for and those things are probably qualities in him that your daughter loved about him and that she would not want him to be lost without her. Not forever.\n\nIt's hard to know the right things to say when the sense of loss is so acute but if it's true that he has no one that will take him under their wing while he grieves then he's going to need at least a little something to hold onto. It is nice that you are concerned with him even while you and your family are still working through the loss. It sounds like he needs the support desperately. ",
            "I'm so sorry for your loss. Losing someone so young is heartbreaking. I'm glad you guys are doing okay, and it's really sweet of you to be concerned about her partner.\n\nOn a really basic level, just make sure that he's taking care of himself. I remember when my boyfriend died that I only ate because my Dad came in and put toast in front of me. It was actually quite some time before I was properly taking care of myself again. He's obviously not a complete mess, but it might be an idea to check out the apartment on a fairly regular basis (without overstepping the mark, of course).\n\nSomeone else suggested not offering open-ended invitations to do things, which I recommend. My parents had to go out and so my Nan came round and said \"right, we're going into town while they're away\" and it helped to get out and about a bit. We could speak about grief and things outside of any sort of super-intense conversation, and I think it helped.\n\nSee if you can get him something to do that's related to her. You know, get his mind focused on something at the same time as allowing him to grieve. My boyfriend and I worked at the same place and a lot of our coworkers couldn't make the funeral as it was during work hours, so I organised a \"celebration of his life\". It was amazingly calming and therapeutic to do that for him. To organise an event, to see how many people chipped in to help with the venue and catering and whatnot, and to plan who would give little speeches and stuff, and make the slideshow of pictures. If there's anything at all like that that you could organise and get his help with or something, that would be good.",
            "I am so sorry for your loss. I know words can't help. I lost my brother a few months back. I had to tell my dad over the phone (I live two states away) and the moan he let out is the worst sounds I've ever heard. The pain you must be feeling is incredible. I commend you for being able to teach out to her boyfriend. My brothers girlfriend is someone we have adopted into our family now. No one had met her before he passed. But I have done everything I can think of to try and make her feel like my sister. My only advice would be, treat him as if he was your daughter and he has passed. Give him the absolute unconditional love your daughter had from you. I think it will help both of you heal. And it might just be enough to keep him from leaving this world. (But it's not your fault if he makes that decision. My brother killed himself. We have been working through those emotions.) If you ever need someone to talk to, please, I'm here. ",
            "Maybe invite him over for dinner (or out to eat) once a week. It'll help him to know someone cares about him. Plus it might help him grieve by talking to you about your daughter. Hope it works out man!",

            "I'm sorry for your loss. It'll be a year since tomorrow since I lost my boyfriend unexpectedly. What really helped with his family was them just checking in every once in a while. Still maintaining some normalcy I guess you could call it helped. It was nice just to hear from them. You do have to give him space and let him grieve in his own way. Maybe trying to get to know him a little better would help and he may still feel connected to her through your family. ",
            "You're such an amazing person. After your daughters loss, you are still worried about someone who you've met 5 or 6 times in the past. I hope that wonderful things come your way in the future and I'm so sorry for your loss. ",
            "My sister died in a car accident. It ruined her b/f. I befriended him to ensure he didn't turn to drugs or alcohol. Keep in touch with him on a regular basis for the next little while maybe. Show him that he he has support behind his loss :)",
            "Do you have some kind of momento of her you can give him? I had a (best) friend pass away when she was 19, I was 20. This was in 2007, Its been going on 8 years in August, I still visit the gravesite from time to time. What I would tell him is to keep a lookout for signs that shes still around, just not phyiscally, the signs may be mental or physical but they are there. If she had something you can give him to keep the memory of her alive that would maybe be helpful. I always wish I had something from my friend that passed away, just the memories, but something else, physically to hold onto during the rough days. Theres NOTHING I can say that will ease the pain or hardship you are going though but just, believe.",
            "I was in a similar situation to the boyfriend. My gf died when I was 23 from brain cancer. And honestly everybody is going to handle grief differently. It would be a nice gesture to reach out to him but mostly this is one of the few situations in life where you need to think about your self and your own emotional health",
            "I don't know if you have said this already, but any variation on \"I consider you a son to me\" goes a long way, especially given that his own father has passed away. It might make him feel more connected to you and your wife and possibly less suicidal, as he will have something to live for (he will be able to see aspects of his significant other in you both).\n\nSome people don't get much out of therapy and he seems like the type who may benefit from a different medium. If he seems bookish, I would give him either a fiction novel that helped you through past difficult times or maybe a gently put self-help book(could also give movie or game). This will ensure that even if he doesn't feel up to therapy, he will not feel alone, have resources around him, and if you have a link to the item you are bestowing, the relationship between you two may also grow. \n\nThis is a given, but convey to him that your daughter's memory will be cherished and never forgotten. When someone loses someone they loved so absolutely, they want reassurance from those around them.\n\nOP, you are an amazing person. Thank you for reaching out, providing a support network is so important.",

If he's close to them, maybe them suggesting counselling would have more of an impact? \n\nEdit: I've just  seen you say he has no family that you know of. Otherwise perhaps see if, if he's at college, there's grief counselling on campus you could suggest to him? It may be easier for him to accept if it's in a familiar environment? I wish you and your family all the best. ",
            "Sorry for your loss. Poor kid. Sounds like he's really alone. I lost my brother seven months ago to cancer. He was 31.

He maybe could talk to a grief counselor.",

Just wanted to say what an amazing person you are to worry for someone else in your time of grief. \n\nI agree with the grief support group idea (and am him to tag along).  If you are up for it, see if you can get him to visit for dinner and share some stories.  Tell him it's for you and your wife to learn more about your daughter.  I'm guessing he wants or needs a friend right now and doesn't have anyone to talk to,  but may be able to confide in you once you get to know each other a bit more.  More be open to therapy after he talks a bit.  Seeing what he saw in her and learning what he loves about her might be therapeutic for both of you.  Maybe you can tell him some stories too...of her as a little girl, etc\n\nBest of luck and I'm incredibly sorry to read about your daughter...whatever happens,  I hope you find peace. ",
            "Jesus. First of all, a vehement salute to you for caring so much about your daughter's boyfriend. I think it's hard for him especially because of his age; he's likely not experienced much of this before, let alone the loss of someone this close to him. And absolutely, grief support is key, especially if he's feeling alone - it'll help him realize that he's not alone. And he needs to be around people, period. \n\nI don't know if this will help, but maybe there's something you can do to honor her life in some what that will make him feel better about it. Every human has the right to hope and you both have the right to feel hopeful that good things will come (not from her death, I mean). A friend of mine's younger sister died a few years ago, and her sister's best friend made these beautiful stickers that people have put all over the world and taken pictures of because Rae loved to travel, so in a way Ada feels like she's continuing a legacy of love. ",
            "A friend of mine was in a similar situation, her boyfriend died. His family was very kind to her. \n\nOne thing they did that made the whole thing easier for her - his mother gave her a beautiful piece of jewelry that had been in their family, and told her that she loved her, was glad her son had known her, and that she wanted to be invited to her happy wedding one day. This made it so much easier for my friend to let go of the guilt of moving on when she eventually did move on. She is still close with his family. ",
            "I feel as though you're already helping, to be honest, by reaching out. \n\nWhen my boyfriend died, it was what I assume to be a different scenario (suicide) than yours. His mother cut me and my family out of her life entirely (his father had already passed away). The only contact I had with her was an hour or so a few weeks later when I went into a mental hospital myself, voluntarily, for depression and suicidal thoughts. She came over during visiting hours after I called her out of sheer desperation, and promised we would talk and reminisce when I left the hospital. That never came to pass.\n\nI can't say necessarily that I don't understand her treatment of me or that I blame her. But at that time, I did. I felt as though I had not just lost my boyfriend, but also my second family, as our families had been friends for my entire life. I felt as though she hated me and didn't care if I lived or died. And I felt as though it were my fault when my mother grieved over losing her best friend alongside the boy she considered her son.\n\nSo I don't know if I can give you any advice that hasn't been given already. But from my own perspective, I think that you are doing exactly what I wish would have been done for me.\n\nYou are a good person. I'm sorry for your loss.",

            "There's a lot of really great advice here, so I just wanted to share something I experienced recently with the death of a loved one. My wife's aunt died only 3 weeks after being diagnosed with lung cancer. She spent her last week's with the people she loved, including a \"living wake\" where all her friends and family gathered together and shared stories about her (she was there), how much she meant to them, etc. it was beautiful. My point is that, in meeting all these people, I discovered parts of my wife's aunt I'd never have known. We all have these different parts to ourselves, and sometimes even the people we're close to don't know *all* of us. Surely your daughter's relationship with her boyfriend was different from yours, and surely you each knew her in a way the other didn't. Share that with him. Tell him you'd love to know his girlfriend better, because she's certainly a bit different from the daughter you knew. I'm sure he'd take some comfort knowing more about her and what she meant to you. I took so much comfort from that process myself. It allowed me to see the amazing person my wife's aunt was in a whole different way. There's something very special about sharing a mutual affection for another person. I'd bet you and he have a lot in common and don't even realize it.\n\nBest of luck to you. I wish you, your family, and your daughter's boyfriend all the peace and comfort you can find.",

I'm very sorry for your loss, and as someone who has lost people who are close to me in the past, I really appreciate what you're doing for this guy. I remember the warm smile my childhood best friend's parents gave me at his funeral while I was in tears and it meant so much that they were still able to do that despite the fact that their son had just passed away. The death of a loved one is a very isolating experience and seeing the way everyone else goes on with their lives as if nothing happened can be very lonely. I'm sure that just talking to someone else who can relate to him is helping more than you know. If it isn't too painful, maybe invite him to a family dinner sometime - I know when my friend died I tried to spend as much time with people who knew him as possible.",
            "Keep getting him to go the bar with you because eventually he'll share a laugh with you and life will not feel so stuck in place. If he won't go then stay at her grave with him.

I know it's painful to do these things but remembering who we lost is how we become more capable of going on without them. \n\n",

Keep him close to your family like he's your son. You don't need to worry about him committing a suicide. He'll probably deal with it well once he feels you comforting him, which you are doing already.",

            "As everyone else already said: Sorry for your loss!  \n  \nThe consensus here is right I think. Just keep talking to him, invite him over for dinner/lunch/sports, whatever. Maybe on a trip, hiking and stuff, if you really want to.  \n  \nAlso, talk to his family about the situation, but don't make a big fuss about it. Just to let them know their son needs a bit of extra attention. I know from first hand experience how lost you can feel, when you're getting dumped and you suddenly have almost no friends left. Someone dying is obviously worse, because that person is gone forever, BUT the circle of friends and family usually is still there, so he needs to make use of that.  \n  \nYou're probably not overreacting. People say that grief will pass, but obviously it does not for everyone, otherwise we would not have grief-related suicides every day. I think it's important to get drag him away from the edge right now. He'll likely recover sooner or later, but the initial period is the worst.  \n  \nThat being said, you have no obligation towards this kid. Notify his family and get out of his life IF you want to. This may sound harsh, but he's not your family and you have enough to grieve yourself. If you can't handle it, don't.",

They call me to see how college is going and ask questions about my life. His mother calls me her daughter and at first it felt odd but I think that it was a good thing because now I have an outlet with them. I really didn't want to talk to my friends about it anymore than I had so his mother and I started talking and it's helped so much. Maybe sometimes all you can do is just be there. Good luck OP.",

I commend you for looking out for this young man in what is already a difficult time for your family.  I wish I could offer more solace for this young man.  The idea of going to a group counseling and asking him to come along is without a doubt the best advice I have seen.\n\n\nAs another person said, if something does happen with her boyfriend, DO NOT blame yourself.  You are obviously trying very hard to help him.  I recently lost family members to suicide.  They came without warning.  My cousin was the first, and she seemed as happy as can be.  She was very close with her mother and sister yet no one even suspected anything.  She was a very positive person, very uplifting.  She shot herself, and to this day none of us really understand what she was going through mentally because she hid it from all of us.   I guess my point is, that it's really hard to know what someones real intentions are.  \n\n\nBest of luck to you.",

Get to know him, and feed what helps and squash what makes it grow. ",
            "When I lost my wife to cystic fibrosis at the age of 31 I felt much the same as he did. I pretty much locked myself in my house and did not go out much. There were a few things that saved me from going down a darker path.  \n\nMy younger brother moved in with me. I didn't make it easy for him but he was there whenever I needed something.  \n\nI was lucky enough to find. Fried counselor I could relate to and he gave me some coping tools to move forward with. \n\nMy job got a full in manager for me and I was able to take three months off without losing my position and they gave me some extended vacation pay.  \n\nMy wife's mother has continued to be in my life and calls me her son and we spend holidays together.\n\nAnd my wife's best friends. They made sure to keep me in their lives and help cope.  In fact one of them recently presided over my new marriage (she passed away in 2004, took me a while to move forward) and we both felt lucky to have her there. \n\nThe important thing is to show him there are people that care about him even if he rebuffs you all the time. He may not end up doing much with you but just the asking could be enough. Just keep being there. For me the hardest part was when people started moving on and I couldn't.  It's not the first couple weeks that are the hardest but the following months.\n",
            "Having just lost 1 friend and one family member in the last week, I am dealing with more than my fair share of grief.  It's easy to want to curl up into a little ball and try to shut out the whole world.  The one thing that has helped is all the little everyday things: grocery shopping, making dinner, playing video games, talking to friends, working around the house, etc.  All the little pleasantries and trite statements about time soothing the soul don't really help; they just serve as a reminder of your loss and make you wonder when things are going to get better.  My advice is to help him focus on the little everyday things that make you feel human.  Take him shopping for groceries.  Walk his dog with him.  Clean his house up.  Mow his lawn.  Whatever day-to-day things need to get done,  take care of it for him.  Don't try to talk to him about his grief at first.  In time he may start to do these little chores with you and when he's ready, he'll talk to you.  Try to do something for/with him 1-2 days a week.  This will give you the opportunity to be there when he's ready to talk and allow you to observe him for signs of suicidal/drug seeking behavior.  I'm sorry you lost your daughter, but you have the opportunity to be a dad right now, even if you don't really know this young man.  Maybe that will be good therapy for both of you.  Good luck, OP.",

If you suspect something may happen, then I'd try to stay persistent with them, annoyingly so if you can. Invite him over for dinner, or bring dinner over to him, etc. It may seem awkward or disingenuous at first but it won't be after few times. Same idea with if you share any hobbies. Does he like video games? Follow any sports? etc. The only thing I'd stick away from (which might not be an issue if he's 20) is drinking.

        "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nIt has been about 4 months since I made my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9641hl/my_36f_boyfriend_50m_cancelled_our_holiday_and/) so I thought I would update.\n\nTL:DR - We broke up.\n\nAfter he returned home from his (our?) holiday, I tried to raise some of the issues that were pointed out to my by people who commented on my original post, which all boiled down to a reality that basically our relationship is really only a relationship to me and that for him I am just providing the \"girlfriend experience\" without being able to expect or enjoy any kind of commitment. \n\nHe defended his actions and did manage to generate a pretty impressive list of ways he has been there for me over the past 4 years. But as I learned from you wise people, he is really only there for me when it is on his terms, and when he is being \"so sweet\" it is likely an act, whereas the rest of the time he is just being himself. \n\nWe broke up a couple of weeks after he returned home. I will admit that it was devastating for me and I really had to go through a grief process for the loss of how I hoped things might turn out. Until about a week ago, he would not leave me alone. He left me daily gifts at my home (actually inside of my home until I made him give me back my key). He recruited my friends to do little surprises for me, knowing I hadn't had the heart to tell people about our break up at that point. It was humiliating. When it was my birthday, he sent a lavish gift based on a sexy inside joke of ours. He came to my work place (he is a consultant there, I am on the payroll) and acted as though we are together, making me cry in the bathroom at how awkward it was because I hadn't told my colleagues about our split at that point. And worse of all, I took myself to a hot country to have a solo vacation - all \"sister doing it for herself\" - and he had the nerve to JOIN ME at the place I was staying after he found out about it from others. When I asked if he was there because he changed his mind and wanted to be with me (hopeless hope, I couldn't help it), he laughed it off and said no, my trip just sounded fun so he thought he'd have fun with me. He ruined a vacation I really needed, and I embarrassed myself crying many tears in a beautiful, tropical paradise surrounded by people in love, or at least that's how it seemed.\n\nI realize how horrible he sounds when I write all of this out, but we did have many good years together, including a lot of fun doing a shared hobby that not a lot of people are into and that is super time consuming. I'm not sure how to face him in our mutual spaces anymore. I don't know what switched off for him to finally give me space, but it has helped immensely for me to heal and get over this without him lurking around or love-bombing me to try to get me to change my mind. After the vacation fiasco, I know that he is only reaching out because he misses the convenience I brought to his life, not because he misses me or cares about me, or he never would have done such a rude, selfish thing.\n\nI am posting mainly as a thank you to those of you who took the time to reach out and share your perspectives with me, both gently and not-so-gently. I am not sure how I was recruited into allowing him to treat me that way, and I'm working with a very fantastic therapist to learn more about who I am in relationships. It will be hard to spend the holidays without him and I miss his kids a lot, but it is such a good feeling to know that I have a fresh start. I've been enjoying the holiday parties with family and friends this year, and have met a couple of really cute men who are close in my age, seem emotionally available, and are immersed in interesting, creative careers. They flirt with me like I'm a real person - you know, talking and asking questions instead of just compliments and being taken to events like the token \"I got dumped by my wife but check out this hot babe who loves me\" type of girlfriend. I'm being careful and oh so slow, but guys, oh so hopeful too.\n\nI am very grateful for your help. I hope you have a lovely holiday and a wonderful new year. \n\nSigned, \nRecovering Plaything ",

He's stalking you, love bombing you, and cornering you - despite making it clear that he views you as a \"fun time\", not a girlfriend. I would not be above doing a facebook general announcement:\n\n\"I really need help because this situation has reached scary levels. Weeks ago I broke up with X because he made it clear that he doesn't respect me and viewed me as a way to pass the time. Instead of letting me move on, he's stalked me on my vacation and used my friends to send unwanted gifts and communication. He's stalked me and harassed me through people I love while I've been quietly trying to process the break up. Please please please don't help him to continue to stalk me or harass me. Its not romantic, he is not trying to win me back, and he's scaring me.\"\n\nYou don't have to facebook this if you don't want to but I view it as more as a way to communicate with the whole of your network.

Lavish gifts. In retrospect he was humiliating me to preserve his ego.\n\nThree years later I am married to the kindest, most loving man of my dreams. He may not send me lavish gifts, but he is my rock and the definition of selflessness. I didn\u2019t think I deserved him for a long time. My self worth needed recovery.

People like him don't get over rejection easily, as you can see, so I can only imagine how he treated/treats his ex-wife. Not to be harsh, but part of the reason he could have been dating you was to hurt her or make her mad that he was seeing a younger woman. \n\nI would also have already contacted the police so that there is a record of his behavior after a few of those attempts and definitely would if he persists.",

We had one great blowout. When I told him he needs to cancel his trip, he told me to \u201cfuck off\u201c and \u201che needs to do this for himself\u201c. I told him I plan to fuck off. Still denying seeing the woman this weekend.\n\n-Miscellaneous shit: found a receipt thatincluded a new box of condoms, then found condoms. We don\u2019t use condoms. He still talks to the other woman daily, and is currently helping her with her resume. \n\n-I told him I\u2019m done, etc., and he\u2019s looking for an apartment.\n\n-He left for Denver this morning. He hugged me and tried to kiss me (?!) but it landed in my hair because I pulled the hell back.\n\n-I am talking to lawyers next week- an immigration lawyer and a divorce lawyer.\n\n-I am considering changing the locks this weekend while he\u2019s off doing God knows what.\n\n-The lies have continued (he didn\u2019t buy those condoms!) , and the absolute disrespect has continued as expected. I\u2019m still having moments of absolute heartbreak , and there are still some days I can\u2019t get out of bed. I really really think he believes his own lies and genuinely sees nothing wrong with what he\u2019s doing. \n\nI reread\u2014 daily\u2014 all of the comments and messages from my original post. I am so grateful for this community. You all \u2014along with friends and family\u2014have established a firm foundation under my feet.\nI cannot thank you enough.\n\nTL;dr:  Lies continued, left for Denver this morning, the woman he talks to daily is there, meeting with lawyers.

I know it's been almost 2 weeks since my last post. Some of y'all offered some great advice...again, thank you. So here's what happened since my last post. \n\nI went back to work the next day and Jack was off...it was blissful. I didn't see him the rest of the week because he went back to Montana to see some family. I only knew his whereabouts because another coworker felt the need to inform me... \n\nAnywho, Jack gets back that weekend and on Monday he runs into me as we clock in. Immediately he begins to describe Montana...his sister was getting married in a small wedding...the colors...the flowers. I express my congratulations to his sister and start heading to my department. We don't see each other until lunch break.\n\nI'm sitting down enjoying my leftovers when Jack comes over and starts in on what he has in mind for my wedding, even so far as mentioning price brackets. I put up my hand and tell him to stop. I tell him that my fianc\u00e9 and I are doing a courthouse wedding, it may not be romantic in his eyes, but it's what we want to do and what we are looking forward to doing. I also told him that he needs to drop the subject as we are not changing our minds.\n\nHe starts apologizing and saying that he didn't realize that I was serious about the courthouse. I just shook my head and told Jack again to stop talking about it before I walked away from him.\n\nYesterday I heard from another coworker that Jack was upset and didn't mean to cross lines with me. At this point I don't care. I said my piece and am super happy that I stood my ground. I will keep doing this too because it feels good to not be a doormat. I should've done this sooner! Thank you again. \n\n**tl;dr**: Jack went on vacation, came back, and started his usual spiel. I stood my ground and it felt pretty damn good.",

He might be someone who you have to really get his attention, not just say his name and then say something while he's looking at you.  I mean REALLY get his attention, with a rather serious and stern demeanor, and tell him in a very blunt manner what you want him to understand.\n\nUsing your story as an example, even though you were saying \"no\" and \"we already have our flowers planned,\" it might have been necessary to look him in the eyes and say, \"Jack, listen to me.  We already have things planned out and we are NOT changing them.  I am being serious and you need to let it go.\"  This, before things progress to the point that they did, and when he starts to apologize, tell him, \"It's fine, just sometimes you don't listen to what I am telling you and I didn't want this to be one of those times.\"  Hearing that might help him develop a better awareness of listening to what someone is saying, vs what he thinks they mean or what he wants them to say.",
