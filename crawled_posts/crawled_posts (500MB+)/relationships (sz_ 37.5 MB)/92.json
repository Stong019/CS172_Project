        "selftext": "I got a lot of really great feedback from the original post about 3 weeks ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7fka81/how_do_i_26f_stop_feeling_bitter_about_my/) and guess I just wanted to say thanks. \n\nIt took a few days to digest what a lot of people were saying.  At the end of the day I hoped to approach the situation as me wanting to be close to my family again and basically trying to ignore the money part.  For the next couple of weeks if I wanted to talk to my mother I made sure to call at a time I knew she wasn't swamped with work (either before she left for the day or before going to bed) and if anything to do with money came up, it was treated as a side note. \"Oh dad won 4k last night online? That's awesome for him. Where are you travelling for work tomorrow? Have you been there before? Are you looking forward to it?\" and she just sort of.. opened up. I told her how I was feeling slighted, fully addressed the issue and even told her how I felt the slight favoritism towards my brother, because he was present, was getting to me. \n\nMy mother is an extremely intelligent woman, reading back on my posts I think I stressed this a lot but she really, really is. We had our one super feelsy chat and moved on but she's been going out of her way to show me she's serious this time with actions not just words. I was over recently and before she dropped me off at home (we live about an hour away from one another) she stopped to at a store and remarked \"your dad and brother lost 600$ last night online, what kind of fucked up logic is it that I can't afford to buy you some groceries?\" . Our upcoming Christmas plans, which I was dreading, are now actual plans. She's picked out a theme for before and after dinner, neither which involve gambling, and is incredibly focused on us spending time away from a computer screen. Our gift exchange is a 20$ limit and she found some game online so that nothing is tailored towards anyone and we all feel included. She's been providing ideas for the wedding planning and even called me the other day saying \"Well you call me all the time and I was thinking about you so I thought I'd call you!\" just to chat. Overall... Im kind of stoked about where this is going. It's only been less then a month but I've never known my mother to commit to something and not stick with it so, I'm remaining hopeful.\n\nThanks for all the insight, personal experiences and words of advice for coping. I read every single one of those comments over and over for weeks so I figured some kind of update was warranted.\n\nTL;DR: Talked to mom again. Used a lot of points from my previous post and communication saves the day once again. ",

            "In the last post you replied to people saying your family had a gambling addiction by saying that they were doing this \"before they had money\". Well, just FYI, people who are poor are the majority of gambling addicts. If they're not gambling addicts, they should be able to not gamble for two weeks straight, or not talk about gambling every time you see them, or not have it be THE activity in their house. But I can't imagine any of those are true. Regardless of how much money your mother got, gambling can ALWAYS take it away. Literally. She could have 100 million dollars right now and if her or her husband are suffering from a gambling addiction, that money is still in danger. Gambling addiction is a progressive disease- eventually, the wagers get higher and higher, and even if you're \"just\" losing 2k a day, it only takes a year and a half to lose a million dollars total. Raise that wager up to 10k and in the same period of time that's 5million down the drain. Please, it's not going to go away, and your family needs to deal with this.",

            "Sounds like she might be aware of her own feelings on the activities and maybe didn\u2019t know how to express them or feel they were valid too. Maybe she\u2019s been having thoughts that their gambling is a little too much and wants to do something besides that and is relieved you are helping redirect her focus.

For the past week, I've been trying to focus on myself and my work and not care about my ex and my boss who's dating her. It worked pretty well, I started a painting and I'm pretty close to finishing it and I impressed my boss boss (the professor who owns the lab, not the one dating my ex) by staying late for two days in a row to finish a really difficult experiment. During our lab meeting, my boss boss shouted me out in front of the entire lab and said he was really impressed by my hard-work and dedication. That felt good.\n\nAs for the situation with my boss and my ex, he found out. Like I mentioned in my previous post, when my ex told me who her new boyfriend was, I didn't mention that he was my boss so neither of them knew. Two days ago, my boss and us (two other undergrads) were in a conference room discussing a paper when my ex came in. She came to drop off my boss's wallet that I think he forgot or something. Anyway, she saw me, did a double-take and went, \"Jaaaake?!\". She was definitely super surprised and caught off-guard and her boss was already like \"wtf\" so I was just like, \"heeeyy 'Sarah'\". She shot me another shocked wide-eyed look and left. Suffice to say the rest of the meeting was pretty awkward. \n\nThe next day, it was obvious that my boss now knew our history. Things just turned so awkward. Like he didn't now how to act around me anymore and what to say. Now we're both awkward around each other. He's still nice and all but things are just uncomfortable between us two now. It's not his fault though. I think that things will get better between the two of us but as of right now, I actually feel kind of relieved that he now knows. Something about how both of us now don't know how to act and what to do kind of makes me feel reassured.\n\n\"Sarah\" also called me the night that she found out I worked there but I missed her call and forgot to call back. It's good though, I've been trying to think of her less and distance myself a bit.  \n\nBut if things continue to remain really awkward to the point where both of our work is affected, I'll consider talking to my boss boss about switching me to work under another grad student instead. \n\nBut yea, that's about all. Again, thanks for the help guys.\n\nTL;DR: Been focusing on myself and my work. Boss found out that I'm his girlfriend's ex and things are now awkward but bearable. \n",

Or the likelihood of seeing you if she kept her dating pool there?\n\nIMHO, you really demonstrated an ability to be above drama by not immediately telling your boss or Sara about your previous work/romantic relationship. \n\nAnd i\u2019m super stoked that, instead, you just focused on work and got praised by your boss boss.

Even if she isn't a student, she's 19, who does he think she socializes with at that age? Only professors and researchers??",
            "If anything your boss probably feels embarrassed that he\u2019s dating the girl that his 19 year old subordinate dated. That probably feels slightly imasculating to him if he enjoyed feeling powerful over you. The \u2018he has got your leftovers\u2019 mentality if you will. Sounds like you are killing it and doing everything right! Keep up the positive attitude and hard work, thanks for the update.",
            "Hey buddy, you may want to do one thing to cover your ass. Go tell your boss's boss that your boss is dating your ex, and that it isn't a problem for you, you just wanted to let him know. You don't know your boss that well yet. He's feeling awkward. He might be an asshole. He might be very insecure (he's a grown man dating a 19 year old... That's a very big five year gap, much greater than 35 to 29* and when you look back on this when you're 24, you'll see just how true that is), and it's very possible that he'll come after your job. Romantic entanglements can really fuck shit up at work. Imagine being an insecure guy, seeing the guy that used to fuck your girl at work everyday, and having the power to do something about it. \n\nEdit: typo",
            "OP, I missed your original post, but I thought of something that might help give you perspective.\n\n> Maybe it's because he's a major step-up from me. I'm a poor, disorganized undergrad and and he's a successful, young talent who has his shit together.\n\nThat's one way of looking at it.  In your older thread a lot of people told not to think of it like that, which is also good advice, but here's a different approach... Maybe you're thinking of it like a competition, or maybe a game, like an RPG, and he's the \"more powerful\" character.  But if you're thinking about it like that and the game started at 18, he's 5 levels ahead of you.  You've got 1-2 years into adulthood, he's got 6, 3 times more.  If it were a game/competition, there's simply no point in comparing a level 2 character against a level 6 character.  You have to compare where he is today with where you are in 5 years.\n\nSimilarly, this same concept becomes a problem in relationships.  Brief tangent then I'll bring this back to your situation; it relates directly.  I'm a big fan of the age / 2 + 7 formula for dating.  At 24, 19 is the absolute bottom end of who he should be dating.  Why does this formula seem to work?  Because starting at 14 (7 * 2), for every year of life you experience, the range of experiences people can go through doubles, as well as the ability to acquire skills, knowledge, and resources in life.  For example a 30 year old likely has figured out what they like and don't like, been through some good and bad relationships, and have started or are starting a career; Them dating a 19 year old is inappropriate and fraught with problems because the 19 year old doesn't know what they want and hasn't had relationship experiences to help them be on the same level with the 30 year old.\n\nSimilarly, a 25 year old woman versus a 50 year old man is also inappropriate as the 50 year old is settled down, generally has substantial skills and resources/investments built up, and not a lot of time left to enjoy them before age takes its toll.  The younger woman doesn't have a lot of ability to refuse things the older man wants, as the increased resources make her less equal in any disputes.\n\nSo now getting back to your situation, you're comparing yourself against someone many years ahead of you in life.  His relationship with your ex isn't quite \"inappropriate\" using the formula, but only just barely.  He's further ahead in life than both of you, something that may cause them issues if they stay together.  But you have a lot of time left.  At some point the tables will be flipped with someone else - You'll be the older one who is years ahead.  Does that make you better than them?  In terms of comparing raw skills, accomplishments, and resources, maybe?  But not necessarily when comparing you against them **at the same age**.\n\nSo stop comparing yourself at 19 to your boss at 24.  Compare yourself at 19 to where he was at 19, if you're going to compare at all.  And be mindful that you will find someone that makes you very happy; You've literally just started your dating life, it is highly highly unlikely that you ALREADY found the best girl you'll ever date.  Look up the secretary problem (aka the marriage proposal problem) on wikipedia if you want some perspective on THAT, from a hard-numbers perspective.",

Don't be too afraid to talk it out with them. As a graduate student he has no real authority over you. He can't fire you. Your real boss is the PI.

I caved, I fucking caved and decided fuck it, I'll see what he wants. Maybe this is something worth hearing. I visited the hospital by myself. Now wife. No mom. No sisters. Just him and I.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe looked old and tired and just as I predicted I didn't find it in me to be angry, this wasn't the man I remembered, this was just some old broken man. It would have been a waste of my time to feel angry and yet I did. I was so pissed off because I couldn't stand across from him eye to eye and let him see that the son he treated like dogshit had built a wonderful life for himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe didn't say anything to each other for around an hour. Then eventually I found my voice and said ''you know this is the last time we'll ever see each other right?'' No response. Then he replied ''I know.''\n\n\n\nSo I asked him why now? Why did he want to see me so badly that he had to send a message through my mother for me?\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here is where I learnt that my existence was fuck all to him. He admitted that he did it just to give my mom closure, she didn't ask him to do it but he knew she wanted it. \n\n\nSo I asked him why he treated me the way he did my whole life and he replied, **''I never wanted a son, never had any interest in one.''** It fucking hurt but I kept listening and he kept speaking. He said that in the first few years of my life he tried his best to care about me but eventually he realized he couldn't. Then came the final nail in the coffin of my relationship with that man.\n\n\n\n\n**I never loved you but I didn't hate you either, I just didn't care for you because I never wanted a son, I wanted to give you up for adoption when you were younger but your mother would never have forgiven me, so I did my best to push you aside and you would always try and get my approval for stuff, I felt bad at times but I just didn't care for you** \n\n\n\n\nBy that time I was crying, me a 31 year old man, left my dying father in his hospital room and went to my car crying. I could have gone my whole life not knowing that. Fuck my mom, my sisters, my wife and my dad. I'm just so pissed right now. \n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a part of me that hoped we would bury the hatchet, nope, I just learnt he never gave a fuck. \n\n\n\n\nI will never speak of my father again. I will not attend his funeral or visit his grave. When he dies I'll be at the bar drinking because the fucker is gone from this world and I will do everything I can to be the father he never was.\n\n\n\n\n**TL;DR visited dying dad, found out he never wanted a son, wanted to put me up for adoption, didn't love me, didn't hate me, just never cared about me**\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT:-  **I just want to say thanks to everyone for your kind words, both in comments and pms, they really helped a lot, particularly while I was hung over this morning and laying in bed thinking about life. Also to the stranger who gave me gold, thank you, never had that before and it was quite unexpected.**\n\n\n**I've got a ways to go still, I feel like yesterday opened up wounds I didn't even realized had never really healed and I'll be talking to my wife about it and most likely a professional as well. I won't cut my mom or sisters out, I am not angry at them, their experiences with my father were different from my own and I do not fault them for that, however, right now, the best thing for me, is just to not be around them as much. So I don't think they'll be seeing/hearing from me for some time.**\n\n\n**Once again, I sincerely thank everybody, it was your comments and pms that made me realize, yeah it hurts like shit, but I can't let him have anymore power over me, I'm in the prime of my life and I've built a nice life for myself. I don't need a dying man's approval anymore because I've done the best I could for so long without it anyway, so here's hoping things will get better soon.** \n",

            "You're not an idiot. \n\nThe only idiots here are those Redditors shaming you for not wanting to see your father. And look, some of them are still here.\n\nYour mother knew. \n\nThere is no way a parent can casually stroll through decades of this bullshit without recognizing the abuse that is going on. This is why behind every broken household there can be one parent who is a jerk and another parent who is perfectly complacent in allowing mistreatment to continue. \n\nSomewhere along the line, your mother's need to be in a relationship trumped your welfare and upbringing. Somewhere alone the line, her desires trumped your wants and needs - to the point where she shamed you, turned family against you, and even ignored your father's own wishes just for her own selfish desire to see you two speak. \n\nSo yes, you'll review a bunch of idiots remark how you've earned so much closure, even if this is not the closure you wanted. The reality is that your mother is a willful participant in your suffering, both as a child and as an adult, all because her desires come before you. So this is not closure but instead another obstacle in your way of growing and moving on with your life to be happy.\n\nPLEASE consider speaking with an actual professional and not a teenager on the internet who trolls /r/relationships because school is out for the summer.",
            "The worst part is that if he'd just given you the approval you craved and treated you like a decent human would, you probably wouldn't have kept coming back for his approval. He might've treated others well, but this shows that at his core, he's not a good person, because a good person treats everyone well, regardless of their feelings towards them.\n\nWhat he did made you resent him and hate him, for never giving that approval you craved. He could've made both his own and your life infinitely better by not being shitty.\n\nI hope you can find all the happiness in your life that you deserve and use your dad as a prime example of how not to treat people.",

That is what you will be known for, you will do this so your grandchildren will know what healthy love feels like.\n\nYour father was a deeply damaged man. I get the feeling he had a traumatic relationship with his family of origin, because it is ABNORMAL to behave that way with a child. he sadly was neither resilient nor strong enough to get the help he needed to be a healthy father. His legacy was one of maintaining the cycle of abuse. His lack of getting help and perpetuating the abuse is weakness and small. HE was the little boy acting out his trauma. This was all about being stuck in his trauma/past and nothing about the wonderful little boy who was his present.\n\nVulnerability is strength, you are the strong one.

            "Coming at it from another angle, I suspect your father might of had some deep seeded issues himself, it makes me wonder if he was a victim of abuse and irrationally decided that having a boy would repeat said history. \n\nThe thing that strikes me is that he'd confess to always having felt a predetermined way about male offspring but had no desire to be honest about what contributed to that. I feel like it was one last opportunity for him to dump on you without consequence. \n\nThere's freedom in knowing that none of this was about you. He admitted it was about him. His shortcomings. As complicated as you're feelings can be about being maligned and mistreated It can be better if you accept it's never been about you, he's projected onto you. The equivalent is racists projecting their failings into nit picking other races. It's not from a rational place. \n\nMaybe not today, but tomorrow dump those feelings of inadequacy. You're not the first person to go in an interaction expecting closure and not get it. People do it everyday of the week. It's such an absurdly common human trait we've got thousands of posts on this very forum from people who don't know how to end relationships,or find themselves confused at the end of a relationship, or have crazy exes who can't get closure.

I should've just taken the high road and made a show of complete forgiveness just so she can die in peace. But the cold hate in my heart that wanted to get back at her somehow took over. I never went to see her despite what other people told me.\n\nAfter reading your story though, it opened my mind to a different kind of possibility. Maybe it would've turned out this way too. And knowing how unnecessarily cruel and bitter she was, it's a big possibility.

In 30 years. How you'll want to deal with the scars your father left you at each of those ages.\n\nThe positive - for your future self if not your current self - is that there is no ambiguity. There are no questions. You got the answers you always wanted - even if those answers were the ones you always feared. You *did* get some closure from him, and now there is absolutely nothing more you need from him ever. Good riddance.\n\nI'm your age, but I've spent a lot of time talking to older men about their fathers and the associated pain. And they have regrets, regardless of how awful their fathers were. The bright side is that you will never have regrets about, \"What if...\" or \"Could we have reconciled if...?\" or \"There are so many questions I still have.\"\n\nYou're free from those. Your burden is, \"How do I heal from the pain of that relationship? How do I not let it poison anything else in my life?\" That's a long term project, but it sounds like you've got a good start. \n\nAnd I hope you're able to express your feelings to your mother and sisters: \"Mom, it didn't go well, here's what he said, it really fucked me up, and I'm very angry with you for pressuring me into something I knew I shouldn't do.\" It's completely your choice whether you let your anger/hurt at your father destroy your relationships with your mom and sisters.\n\nAnd, seriously, fuck that guy.\n\n",
            "I hope you see this as I'm late to the party, but I have a similar story as you.\n\nWhen my mom got pregnant at 18 years old. Her and my father were exes rekindling an old flame. IMO he was going for a booth call, and leading my mother on. When she found out she was pregnant she told him. He already had one child from another woman. He went to all the doctor's appointments, and was there for my mom. She picked out my name Richard Torres. I was born in February. He never showed up to the hospital. When my mother called him and said I was born and he had a son. His reply was \" that kid is not mine.\" So I was named differently. He went on to have 5 more children with 3 different women. He claimed all of them but me.\n\nIt's difficult to find out you have 4 brothers and 2 sisters who you've never met that have never tried to reach out to you. Raised by the man who conceived you, who won't even acknowledge your existence. What's wrong with me that I'm the only one who is the outcast.\n\nI could go on about how my childhood was, but I'll just give you the advice I've come to learn from my experiences.  I don't need him in my life, I don't care if he's alive or dead, in fact I don't know if he is. My \"siblings\" have never tried to contact me, so I see it as their loss. IMO I've made it this far in life without them. I don't need them. I only keep people in my life who are going to better it, and me.\n\nSo I don't think of your experience as closure. I don't think you succeeded in spite of him. People like us succeed because of who we are, and the choices we made in life.\n\nI don't let my sperm donor dictate, or have any influence on my life. If I say I got this far in spite of him, I make my life about him in some way. It's not about him. I don't think of closure, I think of it as assurance. I know the path I chose to not let him have an effect on my life was the correct one. Justification on the choices on my life, to not try to get approval, love,  anything from them.",

And seriously, there's something really profoundly wonderful about it - the idea of taking the garbage you've had to deal with, and somehow developing into a good human being, literally leaving the world a better place than you found it.\n\nBest of luck to you!",
            "I don't want to impose, but I do hope you leave an update detailing what your mom, sisters, and wife have to say. \n\nAlso, on the plus side, I think this is grounds for a life-long \"you can't tell me shit\" token that can be used in various situations towards them when they start spouting notions as to what you should or should not do.\n\nR.I.Piss btw.",
            "I'm really sorry.  \n\nI, personally, think could be a good thing for you in the long term.  I don't think you should feel anger at your mother, your sisters, or your wife.  They knew that you'd lose the opportunity to ever confront him if you didn't go see him.  I don't think that they all thought it would be wonderful for you, but it would give you the last ability to ask the questions you asked.  \n\nI think you are very angry, justifiably so, but I think you need to keep it directed at the person responsible: your father.\n\nIt's extremely understandable to have pain for how your father failed you.  He did.  You know it and he knows it.  His coldness and rejection probably meant you sought out his approval even harder, which made each rejection more and more crushing.  That is cruel to do to a child.  His total absence would have been less damaging rather than someone who tore you down.\n\nBut now you also know that *his failure had nothing to do with you and everything to do with him.*  He told you that it was his issue that prevented him from being a good father to you.  You were a boy, and no matter who the individual was that was his son, this would have happened.  It had nothing to do with you and not being good enough.  It was the luck of the draw that you were the boy that was born to a father that didn't want a son.  You were set up to fail, no matter how wonderful you were.  \n\nThat's an awful concept.  But I also think there is freedom to be found in that awful concept once you are over the initial pain.  Your father was a flawed individual and now you 100% know that.  It has nothing to do with who you are and it never did.\n\nThis concept of a parent treating a certain sex of child badly is not a new one.  My maternal grandmother experienced some sort of sexual abuse when she was young (I don't know details other than it possibly being her male siblings) and she went on to get married to a wonderful man and have my mother and my uncle.  My mother got the same treatment you did, while my uncle was viewed as the sun, the moon, and the earth.  My mom was set up to fail because there was some sort of twisted association with my grandmother between being a female child and being bad or being at risk of harm.  And so she just disliked my mother, because my mother reminded her of things she wanted to forget.  \n\nAnd that was always 100% about my grandmother, it was never about who my mother is.  And of course it hurt my mother; she is still sad at her mother failing her.  But she's able to balance her pain by seeing that it had nothing to do with her, and everything to do with being born female to an individual coping with secret pain in a very unhealthy way.  And she's been able to let go of some of her pain, and any wondering she used to do about whether she could have ever pleased her mother.",

Selfish of him to tell you that on his death bed when he could have kept it to himself and let you live on. However, some will argue that any truth is better than a lie. Not sure I am one of those people though. I had a similar situation meeting my grandfather on his death bed. He sexually abused me my entire life, didn't even know a time without it, until I was 14 or so and had the guts to stand up to him. I kept it a secret from his side of the family because he was actually a very powerful figure in the community and I didn't believe my family would take my word for it. Anyways, he got cancer very badly and to save face with the family I went to see him on his death bed. Privately he begged me to forgive him. I told him I would die before I forgave him and that on the other side I would still withhold my forgiveness from him. He was a monster and deserved the nasty prolonged suffering death he had been given. I think a lot of people would disagree with how I handled that but you know what, it felt great. I got the closure I needed from that moment and I believe that I am more healed than most victims of sexual assault. If your dad is still alive... and you're interested in getting the closure YOU want, what if you pop in one day and tell him exactly what you want to say then leave. Seriously... he got to say everything he wanted to say and it gutted you. Fuck him. You're the one that is going to be living for hopefully the next 60+/- years with this. Get what you need out of it even if it is just a big old \"Fuck you\". ",

I know you just opened up some wounds that you were trying to let heal but they're raw and I know hurt real bad right now it will get better over time with the love and support of your wife if it doesn't feel like anything is changing then I'd suggest looking to speak with a therapist so it doesn't lash out in other aspects of your life, there is one thing that I think is a positive and it helped the person that I went through this with in the past. Your Father (which you loved) gave you a blueprint of what a bad parent looks like and although you paid a great personal price for it (you did absolutely nothing wrong & this next part is for your children or if you don't have any your nieces & nephews) you can be a wonderful parent to your child(ren), you have a solid foundation of advanced knowledge & real examples of how crushing the disinterest or neglect of a parent can have an impact in your emotional development as well as adulthood. You paid a high price but you do have a cheat-sheet that you can refer back to an hopefully use your best judgment to handle certain situations while it won't make you a perfect parent or person you have the insight on how to ensure that you express your love and feelings towards those who you choose to care for. You do have people on this planet that love you, you mention that your wife also put urged you to go surround yourself with those who love and appreciate you being in their lives and make sure that they know they mean something to you I know you're angry at her for pushing you to go but she did this with hope that something good & positive would happen for you because we do that for those we love ( we all want those we love to have \"happy ever afters\"). I don't know your relationships you have with your mother & siblings, but you do if they're part of that circle that you care for and vise versa then it may take time but heal that relationship with you how you best think it should go I'm sure they all had your best intentions this one I'll leave you to sort through. I did my best to explain how I went through a situation eerily similar to your and I just want to leave you with a last quote do with it what you want: The best feeling in the world is watching things fall into place after watching them fall apart for so long.

He was good at fighting and this combined with his mental abilities made him very well respected. But he didn't value this respect. When I learned about it I was surprised, I had very similar background. I guess I was the friend he always wanted, and he was the father which he never had.

If you have the cold hard audio, nobody in your family can ever have any illusion as to how entirely pathetic your Biological other is. \n\nPlay it on a goddamned loudspeaker at his funeral. If he's going to be remembered he deserves to be remembered the way he really was.\n\nGod fucking damn fuck that guy. ",
            "Man I can't even imagine how it feels to hear that.\n\nOne part of finding closure is to accept you might wanted him to love you. Your anger is understandable and let it vent for a while. But you are in no way a loser. You tried, you were there. Be proud of that fact and try to learn from the experience. It is in our wounds where we find gold. If you truly do not want to visit his funeral or grave so be it. It is about how you feel and you need to find closure. \n\nIf you are further, try to understand him (without necessarily agreeing with what he did). This might help as well.\n\nYou are a great person and do not think that crying as a 31 year old is bad or anything. Let it go and be yourself. Hope you can find the strength to move on. Not in a dysfunctional angry way, but in a mature way with an emphasis on acceptance and healing. ",

            "Sigh... I'm so sorry it played out this way. Someone said it: you had a feeling it would and that's why you were resistant. Makes all the sense. \n\nSpeaking as a wife, I am pretty sure I'd have encouraged you too if you were my husband. This is because, in spite of my general contempt for most of humanity, I am a bit of an optimist that wants to believe people can change. I believe in deathbed epiphanies. I sat by my own father's deathbed and hoped before he slipped into the coma, that he'd say something to me to make me feel like I was on the top of his radar. At the end, when he started not to recognize people (as the brain shuts down a day or so before death), he looked right through me but somehow snapped into reality when some friends came over. I hoped against hope, but I didn't get it. I don't hold this against him, to watch someone die is to surrender all control - but not hope.\n\nThe people who encouraged you to see him held out hope for you when you weren't willing to admit to having it yourself. They (would, if they know how it went) regret sending you, but they would wonder if you'd have always missed out on it if you didn't and he wanted to give you kindness before he went. They chose hope and love, and they chose poorly.\n\nBut this is your dad being a shit, not them. It's understandable to be angry at them for encouraging you, but they didn't know it would go that way and they hoped it would not. Forgive them first, then forgive yourself. If you can eventually forgive your father and let it all go, you'll be better for it. But you are standing on the precipice of anger and bitterness until the day you die or forgiveness and moving forward, being as you said, the better man than he ever was. ",

Find a way to look at him so that his approval and his words have no value to you anymore.\n\nWhere you came from as a seed doesn't really matter. Plants have seeds that they just throw around and they either replicate or not... it is about keeping the species alive.. Animals, including humans, are not much different. Many of us just do it for fun and sometimes we replicate.. it happens.\n\nWhile it is magical when a strong family bond is created, it really doesn't happen the way, well I was going to say the way it is in fairy tales but even fairy tales show horrible families.. and some great kid emerging from a horrible family and making him/herself into something special.\n\nThis is what you did. You took yourself out of the situation and made yourself into who you wanted to be.\n\nI belief it is because of who you are inside, that great person, that you wanted to make your family feel better.. and you had hope... but a renewed hope for something you had long buried. Do not give credit to his words by trying to drink them, and actually yourself, away. There is nothing wrong with you.. the problem is him and once you see, once again, that he was unable to rise to the expectations and that he was broken, you realize that a broken man doesn't spit out words of wisdom... They are just gibberish, or should be, to your brain...\n\nTLDR: You already had what you needed. Throw that new information out because it is flawed and doesn't belong in your life equation.",

            "Here is a story I think you would appreciate OP. My father was horribly abused by his mother and step-father. He was almost murdered by his mother at 12 and ran away from home. I cannot imagine this 12 year-old crying and running 5 miles to get to his grandmother's house. My dad continued to work hard and go to college. Eventually he made his way to the USA. He never knew if he wanted children to love because he had no idea how to show affection towards a child. But he has been, by far, the most loving father I could have ever asked for. He has always been there for me and has told me since I was a child that he did not know how to be a good father because he had never seen that before in his life. My mother helped him along the way and he did the best he could and it was truly the best. When he messed up, he apologized, when he did good we told him so he would keep it up. \n\nMy father did eventually meet his biological father before he went to college and he thought that he would find a great man. What he found was some asshole drunk that had maybe 10 different children with 10 different women. He was not this pinnacle of masculinity nor this savior for his sad childhood. He was nothing. My father told me he accepted this and moved on with his life. The best revenge he got was that all his children are incredibly successful, never been addicted to anything. I just dropped off my sister to take the bar exam. I am getting my master's. My other sisters are going to excellent colleges. He has a successful business and this August, he will have been married to my mother for 30 years. He reminds me so much of your story you just presented here. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. It looks bleak, but you cannot let your life be dictated by your father.\n\nYou cannot change anything you have done, it is done. What you can do for your future is entirely up to you. You have the power now and that man cannot control you anymore. I wish you the best of luck and I hope that you can find some peace in your future. Good luck and I hope you start feeling better soon.",

I used to ask her once in a while why we never had a normal home life. She would always just say, it was water under the bridge and forget about it. When I was about 40 or 45 she finally told me why she was the way she was. Bottom line after talking about how much she hated living with my Grandmother and how she got married to get out of the house and that she never wanted to get pregnant, she finished with this sentence. \"As far as I was concerned, you and your sister were a curse from God\".\n\nSo my Mom did not want me.  At least she gave me a great example of how not to treat my children.  I never went out of my way to have children but after we had them I told them every chance I got that I loved them.  When I got divorced and remarried, I tried to make sure my step kids felt loved and cared for, just as much as my biological children.\n\nDon't let this man have so much power over you.  The fact that he felt the need to at least pretend that he cared for your mother's sake, means that your Mother cares for you.  If your Wife, Sister and Mother love you, you are way a head of the game.  \n\nDon't let this man have any control at all of what you are or what you become.  Let every last bit of him die when his body dies, by showing a lot of love in your life for those around you.  \n\nDon't make it obvious to others what you are doing but if you go to the funeral, quietly and respectfully celebrate his death.

            "My parents got married because my dad accidentally knocked my mom up with me. He always resented me for that. He was mentally, emotionally, and at least once a week physically abusive. Anything i did would set him off, didn't matter that it could be the exact same thing a sibling would do, because it was me i got beat for it. If he wasn't upset with me, he would ignore me. If i needed something i would ask a brother to get dad's attention. I could sit there going ,\"dad, dad, dad...\" and get no response. The first time one of the other kids asked, \"dad\" he would respond immediately. One of the best things i ever did was pretend he was dead. I socially excelled after that, became a god damn social butterfly. It wasn't until my parents got a divorce a year or two after i moved out that i found out the real reason they got married. Good Christian folk need to get married if they get pregnant right? It kind of all made sense. He resented me for taking his life and freedom away. I think it was a shitty thing to do, but ive come to terms with it. I'll never accept taking his frustrations with his own bad decisions out on a helpless child, but understanding why the resentment existed has given me closure. I know i'm rambling but i don't really talk about it much.

That is not the point I want to make. The point I want to make is that this rejection by our fathers eats away at us. Rejection leads to anger, anger leads to coping (violence, addiction), this leads to shame, shame leads to guilt, and it happens over and over again. It affects us all differently, but that is my story. I would suggest seeing a professional about your feelings, as you mentioned. It is hard work, but I believe worth it.

I have broken off the relationship and am working on getting him out of my house safely.\n\n----\n\nThrowaway. He will absolutely recognize this post if he sees it, but I would rather nobody we know does.\n\nI have been with my partner for coming up on three years now and it seems like he has always shown a certain disregard for my personal space/boundaries. Early in the relationship he asked me to send him nudes and I said no, I have never sent one and won't start now. Saying it once was not enough; he kept asking but eventually he did leave it alone.\n\nFast forward from that and he moved in with me a while back because his lease was up and he hadn't found a new one. Shortly after arriving in my home he went through my closet and underwear drawer and grilled me about unused sex toys that had been a gag gift from a female friend after my last breakup. I explained at that time that I didn't feel being in a relationship with him meant I relinquished all right to privacy or my own space. \n\nMore recently he began to grill me about the last time I had talked to my ex before him and I said \"not since we've been together.\" I couldn't figure out why he was so stuck on it. Eventually he admitted that he had accessed my phone, which I didn't lock at the time, read through like seven years of my email looking for any nudes I had sent to others (none; I have never sent a nude) and found an email I had sent to my ex saying I wasn't comfortable being friends on social media after said ex sent me a friend request. (This one e-mail had been sent while current BF was broken up with me and dating another woman, and I had literally forgotten about it given that even that exchange happened years ago).\n\nAnyway, I have been unable to get past the feeling that this is not only a tremendous violation of my privacy and anyone's who emailed me, but also just the latest in a pattern of him feeling entitled to my personal space. I'm seriously considering ending the relationship over it. \n\nAssuming I can get him to go, do you think there is any chance of counseling improving this side of him or is failure to respect my privacy just a trait he's always going to have?\n\nTL;DR I wouldn't send my partner nudes so he accessed my email without permission to see if he could get any I might have sent in previous relationships.",

            ">Assuming I can get him to go, do you think there is any chance of counseling improving this side of him or is failure to respect my privacy just a trait he\u2019s always going to have?\n\nSo a few things here. First off, therapy is not a total cure to bad behavior. It should be treated the way rehab is in the sense that it can be tremendous help to people who want help. How successful do you think rehab is if you have to convince the person to want to get better? How successful do you think your boyfriends therapy will be if you have to convince him to go?\n\nSecond, you\u2019re asking the wrong question. You\u2019re asking if failure to respect your privacy will be a permanent trait, but you should be asking if failure to respect YOU will be a trait he\u2019s always going to have. The way people react to the word \u201cno\u201d tells a tremendous amount about their character and how much they respect the person that gave them the \u201cno.\u201d If they respect the person, they respect the no. Simple as that. Respect does not mean trying to acquire the information they want by lying, violating privacy, etc, it means backing off when they\u2019re told not to go somewhere. Based on his lack of remorse, this man does not care about respecting you, nor will he unless he suddenly wakes up and realizes what he did was wrong.",

I guess he is reacting from a place of trauma; wounds he probably doesn't even know he has, so therapy is always good .. but he has to be willing to do it, otherwise he won't put in the work. Depending on what kind of person he is, there's a chance he vibes with it and likes it when he gets there and puts in the effort, even if the request of going is initially from you.. so even if you decide to stay or to go, I'd encourage him to go. \n\nAs for you.. you have to think about the right here and now. It's a thing that is very uncomfortable and certainly disrespectful, even if he is conscious about it or no. I always say think about how it is right now, because even change is granted, the quirks and behavior of a person are not granted to change (or they can change in the worst). All we have is right now, and right now is not ok. \n\nI'd at least put in some boundaries, I don't think I'd be comfy with him in my house.

So I\u2019m posting it just in case even one person in a similar situation gets the moral boost they need.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2 years ago I was really struggling with both my mental and physical health. They both spiralled off each other (as invisible illnesses tend to do, unfortunately) and it was really hard for me to improve the home life situation that was definitely not helping matters. I love my grandparents to bits, and I\u2019m very grateful for all the care they provided, but living in an isolated town in the middle of nowhere with only them for company made it very difficult to meet new people or do the few activities I\u2019m still able to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoving to somewhere bigger and with a population closer to my age has definitely been a big factor in improved dating success. It sounds obvious, I know, but it\u2019s not an easy thing to uproot when you\u2019re disabled. But if you\u2019re isolated and find it hard to meet people because there\u2019s nothing to get out the house for, it\u2019s such a boost in quality of life. Now there are places to go and do things/meet new people. There are actually people my own age there to meet!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMeeting people in person also made it easier to have that conversation about my health more organically and casually; preferably after they\u2019ve got to chat with me and know me a bit first too. Online dating works for some people, sure, but I think it\u2019s way less stressful getting to know someone as a friend first and hang out in person without pressure instead of meeting up with a stranger and wondering whether you\u2019ll even want to sit through the whole date (and stress is of course a health trigger). I know I certainly didn\u2019t have the energy needed to sift through the numbers game that is online dating \u2013 I know some single friends who would have one good date for every ten or so dates through apps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI met my current boyfriend at a board games caf\u00e9. Somewhere I could get out, but that wasn\u2019t too taxing (sitting down is a lot less taxing on my pain and fatigue than active sports for example). We got chatting, became friends pretty quickly. He was super oblivious to all my definitely-not-subtle flirting attempts, so at first I figured he just wasn\u2019t interested (especially as he knew about my fibro). Turns out he was just very shy and not wanting to misread anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about my health and he knows he can ask my any questions he wants about it. But honestly, he\u2019s been really amazing and understanding about it in a way I never thought anyone would be. He pre-empts issues before they even have a chance to come up (noticing if the heating turns off too early and grabbing a blanket because he knows the cold makes me worse) and mentally plans out our time together around \u201cWell if we do this on that day, we\u2019ll have a chill day in the next day because you\u2019ll be exhausted\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s still relatively early days, but I wanted to let fellow spoonies know that there are people out there who don\u2019t freak out at health conditions. There are so many support groups and articles online from the perspective of dating/married life when you\u2019re already together and get the diagnosis, so someone\u2019s already invested and supportive. The amount of times I\u2019ve heard \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019d cope without my partner\u201d has been so demoralising as a single person who struggled to find anyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, for anyone who\u2019s going through a hard time right now with their health, or struggling with being single \u2013 don\u2019t give up! Do everything you can to create opportunities for you to meet new people, or even just leave the house with friends and ask them to invite some of their friends you haven\u2019t met yet. It\u2019s scary, yes, and it might be a narrower scope on what you\u2019re physically able to leave the house and do, but even something low key like going to the library, a caf\u00e9, a book club, etc is a good place to start.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;dr: After struggling with dating since my diagnosis of fibromyalgia, I\u2019ve successfully been in a relationship for a couple of months now and am super happy about it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Wow, this blew up so much more than I expected! I'm happy it's made an impact on so many people though, I'm getting so many lovely comments and messages :) I also got my first ever Reddit Gold, so thank you to whoever gifted that! ",

            "I was super worried to tell my SO at first but quickly realized honesty is the best policy. I have lupus/ra/fibromyalgia and am so lucky to have him by my side. I never wanted to be treated as a sick person, which previously happened but needed extra support during bad times. My now fianc\u00e9 has a good mixture of treating me like a normal person but is so caring and helpful when needed. \n\nWe\u2019re getting married in 39 days! Best of luck to you and your SO. ",
            "This is such a positive update. Thank you so much for sharing! Your bf sounds sweet and I hope things continue to go well for you two. I'm so happy for you! ",
            "Thanks for the update! I have fibro too so I love hearing success stories. ",
            "My husband has fibro. I\u2019ll tell you from the other side, it sounds like you\u2019ve got a good one! I do similar things for my hubby. \n\nGentle hugs for you! Hope you\u2019re doing okay with the changing seasons. ",
            "I have Fibromyalgia and almost every spinal problem you can think of and arthritis Everywhere! I live in an area of the country where the weather changes constantly. The barometric pressure changes kill me, as I'm sure many of you can understand and relate to. I also have clinical depression and generalized anxiety. Don't I sound like somebody you'd want to be with?\nBut I'm blessed and lucky beyond belief. I've been with my fiance for over 7 years now and he checks the weather to let me know when fronts are going to be moving through, he does just about anything I ask of him, and he constantly asks me what can he do for me. Especially when I'm having a really bad day. \nWe met online, took things really slow getting to know each other and honestly, I didn't think he liked me as anything more than maybe a friend. (Apparently I'm really dense when it comes to realizing that someone actually likes me ... But hey, he put a ring on it over a year ago!) ;)\nThere ARE good people out there. That special person for you will love you for you - faults, flaws, and all. I had all of these issues before I met him. Some ex's think I'm \"too high maintenance\". My fiance doesn't. He gets that I'm not \"normal\". He's amazing and I know I could live on my own but it really is wonderful to be with someone who gets it. He never doubts my pain even though he can't see it. He never makes me feel less than for all of my \"problems\". It's amazing to be with him. Period.\nI lost all of my \"friends\" over the years from backing out of plans at the last minute so many times. But it's hard to plan in advance because you never know what your day is going to look like when you wake up in the morning. As much as I miss having my group of friends to hang out with, I'd rather not be around people who simply cannot grasp what my life is like and be understanding about it. I miss them but I don't miss the negativity from them. And in that way, I'm much better off.\n\nTldr: don't give up hope. There are people out there who understand and care.",
            "I alos have Fibro(and Lupus, Sjogren's, and RA) girl I feel you. I'm so happy you found someone who takes everything into consideration. I dated a guy whose mom had Lupus and we broke up because he thought that taking care of me when I had flares meant I needed to do his laundry and cleaning his apartment for him. I've been with a guy for 3 years now who didn't know what Lupus was when we met and he really looks out for me when I get sick. The good ones are out there :)",
            "As someone with a whole host of issues that will ultimately lead to my death before a partner, I was in a very similar spot. I did find the most incredible, kind, gentle, caring and loving human I could possible hope for. We got married this September in Iceland. ",
            "Hey! I wasn't around for your last post but congratulations!!! I have a couple of friends who have fibro and they've definitely told me how nice it is to find people, not just significant others, who understand how it is for you. Best wishes and I hope your relationship continues.",
            ">he was just shy and not wanting to misread anything\n\nI feel personally attacked.\n\nOn a more serious note, OP, I remember your original post quite vividly. My invisibilities (heh) aren't nearly so frustrating to deal with, but I was inspired by your persistence and got over some of my own hold-ups that were sourced from health problems. I'm super happy to see an update and see that you're doing well :)",
            "This is really inspiring!!! Thank you for sharing this - and congrats!",
            "Awesome update and I'm so happy for you! I have nerve damage. My fiance is amazing at helping me when I have days I hurt too much to be useful. Sometimes I worry he will find it too exhausting and I warn him that I'll never get \"better\" fully and he just replies, \"The only frustrating part is when I feel like I can't do anything to help.\" So, we focus on finding ways he can assist me and help me manage stuff (even as simple as taking a walk for strength building or standing outside the shower if I'm weak and wobbly), and we both are happier because we feel empowered and proactive! I think finding ways to exert some control over your condition helps so much with the helpless feeling and with mental health. It's a bit scary to admit where you're weak and to rely on someone else, but our relationship is all about teamwork, so we find ways for me to help him as well, which also helps me feel empowered and useful. :)",
            "I'm really happy for you as a fellow spoonie. Your boyfriend reminds me o my dad with the oblivious thing. \n\nMy dad actually  had UC before he met my mom. When he realized they were getting serious, he told my mom, \"Sometimes I shit my pants and it gets worse. If it helps, I can do my own laundry.\" \n\nThey've been married for 30 years and still act like PDA-loving college kids. ",
            "As a visibly disabled person with CP (cerebral palsy), this post makes my heart so happy! All I ever hear are nightmare stories about dating while disabled, so it\u2019s nice to know good people do exist. Best wishes for continued success in your relationship!",
            "There's this adorable couple on YouTube. One girl has POTS, hearing loss, and iirc she's blind in one eye. The second two are due to a hereditary condition, and I cannot remember when her POTS showed up, but I think it was before she started dating her wife.\n\nThey're so adorable and they've done a few videos on what it's like for her living with an invisible illness, and what it's like for both of them as a couple.\n\nThere are definitely good people out there who will love us spoonies :)",
            "Thank you for sharing this! I was diagbosed (dismissively) with fibro around the time I met my husband and it took many years before my doctor found the underlying muscle disorder and I could get actual treatment, but he's always been wonderful. His mom has chronic pain so a lot of things were just obvious for him, like checking in on me and automatically carrying my bags and stuff like that. I feel a lot of guilt for not being able to do my share of the chores a lot of the time, especially when I'm working, but he never guilts me for it. I'm glad you've found someone great too \u2764",
            "His mother says she doesn't believe fibromyalgia is \"a real thing\", that it's all in people's heads. For years that made me so angry. Now, I just don't care what she says or thinks. She doesn't pay my bills and I'm a grown woman. I'm not intimidated by her and I hold my own with her. I don't know if it's because her son and I have been together for so long now or if she's mellowing out as she gets older or if maybe by not cowering to her, I've earned some respect - but she's not as mean towards me as she used to be.",
            "What a wonderful story to read. Thank you so much for sharing. It's so great to see hard times work themselves out!",
            "So glad to hear that you are doing well. I also have fibromyalgia so I am familiar with the pain and exhaustion that come with it, and I'm super proud of you for working hard to get out there and get social when it's just not that easy. Much love \u2764",
            "Thank you so so so much for this update. fibro and lupus destroyed my relationship and I\u2019ve been single for 3 years. This really gave me hope x",
            "I\u2019m in a super similar position to you and this gives me hope so thank you fellow spoonie. I\u2019ve dated a few guys and one I thought was great but who dumped me because among other things, he just thought I was lazy. \n\nI dated one guy who was great with my illness because his mother was severely disabled so\nHe really understood and it didn\u2019t get in the way of our relationship at all. But we broke up a year ago and I have gone on a few dates and nothing has really gone anywhere. Then my condition got more severe and I wasn\u2019t in a place where I could date anyone. Now I\u2019m kind of ready to get back out there but god I\u2019m dreading getting to know someone only to find out they think I\u2019m just lazy or weak or faking it.  So this post gives me some hope. I\u2019m really happy for you friend! Xx",

            "I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and this means a lot to me just haven gotten out of an abusive relationship with a man who told me to my face my illness wasn't real and I was making it up. I've struggled a bit knowing that I'm not always going to be able to take care of myself and that a partner would have at least to be empathetic to that. I'm so glad you've found someone supportive to your pain. :)",
            "What a heartwarming update. I have Cystic Fibrosis (invisible illness represent!) and definitely struggle with letting myself be vulnerable because I feel I'll be disappointed (and haven't been proven wrong). Thanks for reminding me it may be worth it!",
            "What a nice post. I don\u2019t even know you and I feel so happy for you. Thank you for sharing your story so that others in a similar situation may be able to find some hope and make positive change in their life. I wish you all the best :)",

            "I have bad anxiety/ibs plus chronic pain and I feel ya. I've had boyfriends before my now-husbsnd who, at times, thought I might be faking how much pain I was in due to my condition(s) plus wrong medications. I never cared to try and change their minds but knew decent people usually try to understand. It just takes a bit longer to find someone mature enough. The struggle is real!\n\nQuick question though....why are you called spoonies? ",
            "There's this couple on YouTube that I love. Simon and Martina. They're happily married and traveling the world despite Martina having a serious, often invisible illness as well.

I\u2019ve often felt that I\u2019ll always be alone because no one will want to take me on with all my baggage (thank the ex for planting that seed while we were splitting).\n\nYou\u2019ve given me hope and the courage to message a local gaming group about joining when the energy-sap that is Christmas is over. Thank you from one spoonie to another. ",
