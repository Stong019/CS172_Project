            "I get you. I was supposed to be getting engaged and married to a guy who I thought loved me. Come to find he was cheating on me. They have since gotten married and had a family.\n\nThe biggest thing that stung wasnt the fact that he cheated, but the thought that I wasn't good enough for him but she was. I had to realize that I was good enough for a good man.\n\nYou are good enough. You are worthy of love and affection. You are 100% worth it and there is someone out there who will see that. I promise you.",
            "I'm so glad my ex cheated on me with my roommate. They wound up married with a kid then divorcing 5 years later. I met my husband 6 months after they screwed me over and I've been married 21 years now. Don't settle. You're worth it!\n\nedit: fixed a word. ",

            "I had something similar happen to me in college. I was dating a guy who\u2019s long term gf moved away. She was gone for a good year, and when she returned, she contacted him. She knew we were dating but started calling him to fix little things in her house or fake medical emergencies. I was getting tired of it and told him so. He said he would put an end to it and I believed him. \nWe reached two years and he took me to these beautiful botanical gardens and we had the most amazing lunch. Get back to my house, ended up having sex. Once we were done, he got up and said he was going back to her. \nObviously I was shocked and angry. Told him off and threw him out.  \nThey got back together for a time period, then she left him for her best friend who was a woman. He tried to call me Again and I told him to get fucked. He ended up sleeping with a friend of mine out of spite. Such an ass. \n\nGlad you are doing well OP. His heart was just not in it, and that wasn\u2019t fair to you. ",
            "Snap. My ex cheated on me, threatened to leave if I ever got pregnant, never pulled his weight etc. Within a year of me rumbling him and kicking him out, he was still with the other woman...and their baby. We had been together for 10 years. \nThe problem isn't you. It's them. And we should all just be glad in the end that someone had the guts to end something that wasn't working. Plenty of other people carry that shit on for years. You deserve better. You'll find better. Until then, enjoy yourself. ",

I know how shitty it feels to feel like the second choice, to feel like there\u2019s always someone out there more \u201cworth it\u201d to him than you and that you\u2019re just a placeholder. \n\nYour old post is kinda making me reconsider my relationship, ngl",

She always felt in her gut he was still into her but he gaslighted the shit it of her all the time.

I understand where you're coming from when you say your heart breaks for yourself because of how insecure you felt. I have dated men like Harry and the story is the same. My friends have also dated Harrys, and one Harry was even in love with his best friend's fiance and was just waiting until she left him... Harrys are everywhere.

Don't ever think down about yourself, you seem very sweet, very honest and like a real catch yourself. It's a shame you got caught up in this, but don't ever let it make you feel that *you* were the problem. Unfortunately you were blind sided by love and thought you secured something, but his heart was never there. Im sorry that you went through that, you **will** find somebody who will treat you right, and will be your everything. \n\n\nBut id like to imagine that this new you is 1000x stronger and not bothered, so keep it up, girl!",

            "I wish people would erase all of this \"good enough\" language from their vocabulary when it comes to relationships. That's not how it works. They are about compatibility and what the specific person needs in a relationship. There isn't some objective scale and ranking of who would be a good girlfriend/wife/boyfriend/husband. We all want and value different things and it's up to us to try to find them in this life because it isn't guaranteed.",

            "I feel like a lot of people are always \"searching\" for this exciting fantasy of how a romantic relationship should be. But in reality the person who is going to treat you the best, give you the most freedom, and is stable financially and emotionally...that can look a little \"boring\" when in fact being with that person would've been the best decision of their life. \n\nDon't ever feel bad about the fact that you are a good stable person who didn't need saving. Over my years I have come to value that in a person above all else. He is a fool for not seeing your worth, so he doesn't deserve YOU. Yes I struggle with wondering why wasn't I good enough but I take peace in the fact that the other person is literally a terrible human being cultivating a real shitty life.",
            "When it's meant to be, it's the easiest relationship to be in.  Don't get discouraged, when you find yours, you'll be happy that this BS ended.  Your freedom now is worth soooooo much more than being with someone who's got a foot out the door.",
            "What kinda guy allows for someone to get attached for nothing srsly ",
            "Had a similar situation. My boyfriend at the time was absolutely wonderful and we had a great relationship. A year into it, I moved in. A few months later, this girl that was a friend of the family started coming by once a week for a game night. She flirted hard, and he didn\u2019t set boundaries. We talked about it, he made excuses saying that\u2019s just how she is. A week after our two year anniversary he broke up with me because I had told him I didnt feel comfortable with her in our home and that him not setting boundaries was making me incredibly self conscious and unwanted. Turns out, they\u2019d been going behind my back so when I said I didn\u2019t want her around, I got the boot instead. \n\nIt took me two years to get over him but I know now that we weren\u2019t right for each other and someday I\u2019ll find someone better for me ",
            "Dating these days is hard since everyone is always hung up on their ex. But hey, you hang in there. I hope that one day you will find someone who has actually completely moved on from their ex",
            "I'm really sorry this happened to you OP! \n\nMy ex bf told me he wanted to move in with me and think about marriage. However he was cheating on me the whole time. It was really hard to deal with that.\n\nHowever, from that and my previous relationship woes, have taught me that I needed someone who was a good fit for me. Not someone who would make me feel insecure and not good enough. You deserve someone who makes you feel like gold. Someone who doesn't make you feel insecure or question your worth.\n\nI hope you find that someone!",
            "This sucks OP but you deserve better and just because that time didn't work out doesn't mean it never will.\n\nTake care and try and have some fun in the meantime.",
            "Damn girl, I'm so sorry. I really feel for you. \n\nMy ex of 3 years left me for my college roommate. The process of finding out sent me spiraling. I reached the lowest point in my life and honestly it's been 4 years and I still haven't seriously dated anyone. There have been a few short romances since then but what he did scarred me. I'm incredibly neurotic when it comes to relationships now.\n\nHowever, in my experience I can agree that the right relationship will leave you feeling content, rather than the anxiety that you felt in that situation. I've since learned to trust my gut with those types of things. I'd rather wait a decade as a single woman than to be with a man where I felt that gut feeling for even a day.",
            "I was in a similar situation before. We didn\u2019t go that far to call as boyfriend girlfriend, but for some reason it still hurts me even until now. We were just casual dating and we enjoyed the other\u2019s company a lot, I could tell that. One day he just became a bit distracted but since we were both so busy so honestly I didn\u2019t even notice. He then confessed that his ex (who he broke up like 6 months prior) contacted him and that had been driving him thinking. I just shrugged and said if he felt the need to clear things out with her then do it. He said he appreciated my support. Next day they met and he then texted me saying sorry but they decided to try again. We never met again. I don\u2019t know why but I was really hurt back then, and even now thinking about it. ",

            "Oh god, girl, I am so sorry. I\u2019d be devastated but realize this is a lesson to love yourself. You\u2019re amazing and someone just as amazing is seeking you too. Don\u2019t make that situation mean anything for you. Vow to never settle for a partner that makes you feel like less then",
            "I feel you too, I was with this guy (my first relationship) for a year and a half... and we would stay at each other\u2019s place (I was 17, about to turn 18).. and he was real charming.. and I had depression and sever anxiety, and he would always talk about his other gfs before me.. he was kind of obnoxious after a while, but I thought I loved him. When we broke up, it took a while for me to move on... When he broke up with me, he said \u201cI love you, always will and always have, but I need to move on\u201d At that time, I was like awww he still loves me, it kind of helped me with it. But now, looking back... that was stupid as fuck lol. But, even though it doesnt bother me now, but within 3 months of us breaking up, he was with this other girl who ended up getting pregnant, (idk if it\u2019s his baby but if it is, then he cheated on me)... we did live a state away from each other... I mean I live in Mississippi and he lives in Alabama but we both live on the state line just hours away. (If that makes sense).. but when we were having troubles, I had this friend who I had met online before I got with him, but my friend was much older... at the time, I was 17 and he was 23. I fell hard for him, and continued to talk to him all the time. \n\nFast forward to college in 2015, I met my friend in person at college the first day, we hit it off... fell for each other... and now we have been dating for 3, almost 4 years; engaged for 2 almost 3 years. :D I could not be any happier! I am glad you made it out of that, moved on and are happy! \n\nAt some point we all need to be happy! ",
            "It's scary how I feel this to my core right now. Girl who I was dating broke up with me and immediately moved onto someone else, when i learned that (yesterday) it broke me. Like, was I really such a throwaway to you that you left me just to be with someone else? Getting over a serious relationship is doable but hard ",

            "That's a bummer. For what it's worth I know the feeling. There are good people out there who honor commitments and actually mean it when they say they love you and while I never seem to be able to find them, I'm definitely learning it's worth the wait.",

            "This really sucks for you, and I am so sorry you went through it. \n\nIn honesty, the sign posts were kind of there. He crushed on this girl hard, he constantly talked about her, he asked her out numerous times. And she basically kept him on the line, not reeling him in until she was ready. And he fell for it.\n\nAnyone else was always going to be second best. And this guy is a douche for going running when she called, and she is manipulative for doing this. But I also feel sorry for him, he is a sap in this story. She's clearly using him somewhat, she may want to settle down, but may change her mind again.\n\nAnd you, you're an innocent bystander, collateral damage who deserves much, much better than being someones placeholder/backup.",
            "FEMALE SIXTH SENSE IS REAL I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you. \n\nSimilar thing happened to me where my ex-boyfriend of 3 and half years and I met in Uni and his classmate blatantly liked him (while she had a boyfriend back home), I obviously hated this girl (in general she sucked, his friends from his class weren\u2019t even friends with her) ignored it, was a super cool girlfriend and he was very in love with me so I didn\u2019t care. We broke up and 6 months later he started dating this girl. Sometimes you know but being right isn\u2019t great either. \n\n",

            "This may be an unpopular take, but it\u2019s the way I see it.\n\nPeople are responding to this like it\u2019s a \u2018cheating\u2019 situation. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite right. He simply realized there was someone else he had stronger feelings for. So he did the right thing and broke off his relationship. Cheating would have been if he had continued to see the old crush on the side while he stayed with the new girlfriend.\n\nNo it doesn\u2019t make the pain of the breakup any better. But he didn\u2019t plan for things to go this way. Sometimes these things just happen in life.  You meet someone and suddenly your path seems clear. My mom was engaged to someone else when she met my dad in college. Rather than go behind the fianc\u00e9s back, she broke it off. It\u2019s a difficult ordeal for everyone, but it\u2019s the right thing to do. She and my dad got married and had a long happy life together.

Your intuition was right and I'm sure it still hurts when you think about it.\n\nThis is *not* a justification, just an explanation: It's always hard to completely forget someone with whom feelings are unresolved, left in limbo. He'd always have a soft spot for her, regardless of what would have happened, and that's not totally unusual. But (him) wondering if she was \"the one that got away\" will ultimately spell doom for any current relationship (the one with you).\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong. That was his choice. Unfortunately, the feelings were too overwhelming for him to deny. It doesn't make it easier to process and I'm sure there's plenty of emotional trauma in the wake of this. He was obviously still in love with her, but it was a dormant affection that he pushed aside and never resolved.\n\nI know this feeling, from his perspective, and it can consume you. I broke up with my, now ex, girlfriend back in September. It wasn't so that I could be with someone else, but my heart *was* stuck on another girl. It's a long story, but basically that connection to the other girl blew up in my face after a miscommunication and a dumb mistake.

            "This whole thing fucking sucks. The hurt is real and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through it. \n\nI had a similar-ish experience, just on a shorter timeframe. Things were going great, but I just couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I was only the placeholder for the woman he *actually* wanted to be with, who had broken up with him a few months before we got together. I felt like a crazy person to be worried about it and tried to convince myself that he was with *me,* so obviously he was choosing *me,* right? When I finally confronted him about his commitment to me and he just kinda shrugged, I walked away. Four weeks later, he was back with his ex and they were engaged. They\u2019re married now and have two beautiful kids together. \n\nThat pain of feeling like, \u201cwell shit, it just seemed like he wasn\u2019t super into the idea of a more committed relationship. Turns out, he just didn\u2019t want it with *me,*\u201d was so, so hurtful. At least my anxiety about the whole situation was validated and I didn\u2019t feel so crazy about worrying, but that didn\u2019t really help me feel any less shitty. It sucks feeling like you weren\u2019t good enough. \n\nThe good news is, that\u2019s a lie. You are absolutely good enough and he was an asshole for getting in a relationship with you without being absolutely upfront about his feelings for someone else. It\u2019s fine that not everybody is right for everyone else, but what\u2019s not okay is when people lead others on or aren\u2019t upfront so others can\u2019t make decisions based on actual information. \n\nLove yourself and find someone who loves you more than anyone else.

        "selftext": "[Here is the original post.  It is from over two years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40tuc7/me_32f_with_my_husband_39_m_6years_our_sex_life/)\n\nI know my original post is so old, but the biggest update only recently happened.  My therapist suggested I post about it here to help sort out how I feel right now and also as a warning to other people.  I feel like I have grown so much in the last few years and maybe I'm a bit less naive (or a bit more bitter... however you'd like to put it).\n\nThrough interacting with the comments, I came up with an ultimatum I would give my husband.  \n\n1.  He needed to get his medical stuff tested.\n\n2.  He see someone psychologically.\n\n3.  Couple's counseling.\n\nI decided ahead of time that he'd have to do the legwork for this already.  I had already done so much legwork for this relationship and I wanted to make sure I didn't hold his hand through this either.\n\nHe took it surprisingly well for what the conversation was.  There were tears on both sides but he agreed that yes, he would be willing to do these things for the sake of the relationship.  \n\nAnd then days passed.  And a week past.  I finally brought it up again and it caused a minor fight where he told me he needed to do this sort of stuff on his own time.\n\nA few more weeks past.  I realized that he did not care enough to do something about this.  It was a hard thing to realize, but it was clear as day.\n\nI headed over a friend's house to talk things out, clear my head, and come up with a plan for divorce.\n\nI drove home and a few minutes before I arrived, he got a phone call that his sister was in a coma and dying.  I booked him tickets to go see her.  She passed away a few hours after he saw her.  \n\nShe left behind two late-teenage girls.  Who we were now partially responsible for.\n\nSo I pushed my pain down and decided to be the best aunt I can to these two girls.  I also got myself a dog (best decision ever in this situation) to keep my own spirits up.\n\nI worked really hard at this and felt like my husband and I were getting closer in the process.\n\nMore recently, I started realizing that everything we were doing for the girls was initiated through me--not him.  So I started paying more attention.  He was getting annoyed at me making a big deal over surprise care packages their school suggested we send in and other things like that.  I was starting to resent that he wasn't caring for his nieces in the same way as I was.\n\nOn the youngest niece's graduation day, I asked him if he thought the other parents there would be getting flowers for the graduates and if that's something we should do.  This is when he totally lost it at me.  It was a string that started with him yelling about how I get too concerned about these sorts of things and ended with a rant about how I buy too many crackers when company comes over for dinner.  This started changing the lens I was looking at him through again.  Also, at this point, I felt like my nieces had launched into the world with lives of their own.\n\nI started re-seeing the eyerolls when I talked.  The cutting remarks about my intelligence.  Oh, and the utter lack of sex.\n\nSo I started talking to people.  I started seeing a therapist.  And together, we all came up with a plan to discuss everything with him--probably ending in divorce (though I never took that as a definite).\n\nI decided we had a different view of what a relationship and marriage should be.  My plan was to present that to him calmly and let him give his opinion of how he sees things.\n\nI had a work trip so I took the time to recoup.  I went on a long hike, and even though I'm not really religious, I prayed the whole damn time about this.\n\nSo when I got home, in the calmest and most even way I could, I explained the situation as I saw it and asked for his feedback.  My friends and I rehearsed what would happen if he cried and begged for a chance to change--or what to do (or rather, where to go) if he got really angry.\n\nBut nothing prepared me for his reaction.  He agreed with me.  He said that everything felt \"forced\" to him and that this wasn't a natural relationship.  That he married me because that was the path he was on, and since he wasn't planning on having kids, it's not like that mattered all that much.  In fact, he prefers being alone generally.\n\nHe then finished by asking if I thought we should get couple's counseling.  I calmly said that given what he just said, I didn't think that was an option.  He immediately started trying to talk next steps, who gets what, etc.  He brought up that he could probably technically fight for alimony but that he wouldn't.  And said he wouldn't fight for my dog if I don't fight to go after his seperate finances.  \n\nI think this was the most painful in the moment reaction I could have had from him.  I told him I would give him some space that night, so I drove to my friend's house and cried my eyes out.  Him not fighting it is ultimately better for the long run, but it's really hard to realize that your husband of 5 years (and partner for 8) never really loved or cared for you.  \n\nI should have listened to my gut all along.\n\nWe had that talk last night.  I'm currently sitting in a coffee shop, typing this all out.  I'm a relatively attractive person and I channeled my frustrations over the last few years into lifting and working out almost every day.  So I'm hopeful when it comes to love in the future.    \n\nI don't really know what my next step is.  I might drive to my brother's.  I might look for a storage facility.  It's a bit overwhelming to think about.\n\nOverall, I'm so grateful this is happening now and that I won't be looking back at my life when I'm 85 years old, disappointed that it never really started.  I have my life in front of me and it's a big scary place.  But after I finish crying my eyes out, it's one step in front of the other.\n\nAnd thank you everyone for all your help.\n\ntl/dr:  Put off divorce due to spouse's sister dying and despite everything we worked on together, found out he never really loved me.",

            "I am so sorry.. \n\nI wanted to come here to say, specifically, thank you so much for being an amazing aunt to those girls. I lost my mom when I was 15 and my aunts were hands-down the biggest blessing during that time. I don\u2019t know if I would have chosen to continue living if it hadn\u2019t been for their support. So thank you for being so incredibly selfless and supportive for your nieces. ",
            "That is an amazing and powerful journey for you to have gone through. That was a roller coaster of emotion just reading.\n\nI haven't gone through your circumstances, but I've lived enough to know that life never comes at you from the angle you expect. It's some new crisis, either emotional or financial or physical. \n\nYou seem like you have a pretty damn good perspective on everything considering what you've gone through. I know it hasn't been easy but you don't seem to be wallowing in self-doubt and blame like many people naturally would. Have you talked to a therapist or anyone to help you along? Sometimes the full impact of what we've gone through in our lives doesn't hit fully for months or even years after, so be ready for a few more rounds in the ol' ring.\n\nAlso, you really deserve an emotionally rewarding relationship. Where you get loved, and hugged and snuggled every day by someone you trust who always has your back. These relationships are real and there are a lot of people who would probably love connecting with you. In fact I bet you're getting creepy PM's even right now!\n\nOtherwise, thanks for the sharing your story and reminding some of us that there are other people out there struggling, but surviving, and reflecting on all of it.",
            "Jesus, I'm so sorry. That is rough. \n\nYou have every right to be upset, but as you mentioned, his willingness should make the splitting process easier for you both. \n\nYou have so much left to love and give, and he seems stunted. He clearly has a lot of personal introspection that he needs to do before he can ever be in a proper relationship. \n\nGood luck to you, you seem strong and smart, you got this. ",
            "Don't assume his current compliance is a good sign for a smooth road ahead. People flip fast when reality sets in and this guy sounds like a cold fish. Calculating and manipulative.  Get a lawyer, protect yourself. ",
            "My heart breaks for you and probably the last thing you want to do is see a lawyer but you need to do this *immediately*.  You might also want to pay for an investigation into his finances.  It sounds to me like he's playing at being benevolent by 'allowing' you to have the dog without a fight, so you don't know what he's got squirreled away.  \n\nGiven the level the deception he's run on you, *trust nothing*.  Verify independently.\n\nI hate to say this but his realization he didn't really want the marriage and never really loved you isn't a recent realization.  This is a lie he's gone along with to have the wife slot filled for his professional and social benefit.  When dealing with this sort of person, you have to be very careful.\n\nGet the *full* picture before you make any big decisions.  Don't sign or agree to *anything* without a lawyer and an investigation of his assets.  Also don't move out of your home until your lawyer says.  Get any joint financials dealt with as per the lawyer's instructions ASAP.\n\nI realize it must be so painful and exhausting to contemplate these things.  Understand, though, that this is how and why so many women end up the worser after their divorce.  With the kind of man your husband seems to be?  It's even more dangerous.  Hand it all off to the lawyer and go low to no contact with your soon to be ex as soon as possible.",
            "Reading this made me cry. I just want to thank you, OP, this might've been very painful for you to write, but it really hit home for me. This is how the story ends when you stay with someone even though your gut just doesn't feel right about it. It makes me feel very grateful for the relationships I've ended with men I loved but who weren't right for me, even though it was very hard. I feel overwhelmed with gratitude not to be tied to those men. Not to be stuck in a house and a marriage with them. \n\nI hope you have a similar sense of happiness now, or soon, to accompany your newfound freedom.",
            "And now you can go forward with a clear vision of what you don't want.\n\n*All the while knowing you did the best for another woman's children.* \n\nA bit off topic but going forward knowing what you ***don't*** want reminded me of a time I met a potential new friend.\n\nI'd recently ended a toxic friendship with a person who ruled every aspect of our friendship. At first I put up with it but as time went on I realized her Queen like behaviour wasn't something I was willing to deal with.\n\nWhen chatting with this new person I noticed traits similar to the person who I no longer wanted in my life.\n\nI'm sure I saved myself a lot of grief due to recognizing what I wasn't willing to accept. \n\nThere's a big difference between baggage and experience. \n\nSounds like he's stuck in the Samsonite category and you are free.",
            "I read your original post. You did everything you could, and you deserve the chance to be truly happy. He is so emotionally lazy for staying on a path towards marriage when he wasn\u2019t invested.  Who fucking does that! \n\nReal love is going to feel so good after this. It does exist. ",
            "I was in a similar situation. We also agreed we were in the wrong spot and I've never been happier.",
            "I'm proud of you, as strange as it might be for me to say this.\n\nMan, you went through so much. I'm just surprised to see how determined and understanding you were through all these things. It speaks much of your character as a person.\n\n I'm about the same age as you but single. I'm not really big on the idea of marriage but, reading this, I couldnt help but realise yet again how important it is to choose your spouse carefully.\n\nYou are still young and now much more mature and stronger. Probably much more so than I am.\n\nI am sure you will find someone who really loves and cares about you in the future and, more importantly, hope you have a wonderful happy life. ",
            "You are stronger than you know.  You will get through this.  I'm so sorry.",
            "Holy cow, I am so sorry you had to endure that.  You seem like a pretty level-headed person and I am confident you will find someone that works better for you.",
            "I went through this exact same situation after a 5 years relationship last year, except that we weren\u2019t married and we were both 27. The conversation that lead to our break up was also crazily similar, with me initiating it with a possible ending in mind and him deceiving me with his lack of interest.\n\nI just want to say that the thing that really helped me heal was to realize that the pain I was feeling when it ended was pure ego. I was sad that he didn\u2019t fight for me, I was sad that he didn\u2019t seem to see me as worth an effort, I was sad that I had wasted my time with him and felt a bit stupid about it, and in a (terrible but true) way, I was sad that I ended up not being the one initiating the break up even though it was what I wanted. The pain was all linked to my ego, not to the actual break up.\n\nOnce I realized and accepted that, I had such a crazy sense of relief, and ended up not really missing him at all. The relationship was dead long before its ending, and as such, didn\u2019t require a lot of mourning. I mainly needed to forgive myself for standing still for too long, and to heal my old good ego that took quite a hit.\n",
            "I too was in a similar situation, except I'm a man. Though we weren't married we bought a house together. One thing I regret the most is not seeking the help of a lawyer to discuss how to handle the situation. I'm a very forgiving person, which meant agreeing to what she wanted. She got my car and worst of all, my dog. I now live in the house and her name is still on the mortgage 3 years later because I can't afford to refinance. \n\nHer mother ended up hitting the dog with her car killing him at the age of 1.5. He was a beagle that I spent thousands on to get and to keep him healthy after he was sick for a time. \n\nIf I could do it over, I would get a lawyer to agree on the owner of the dog. After he died it was like losing my closest friend and I fell into a very deep depression.\n\nYour story shows you're an incredibly strong woman, and you have a lot ahead of you. I found that after going through something like this you have a more refined sense of love, and know when it's real. I wish you the best of luck, and I hope to hear from you again when you've found your way. ",

            "Oof. This was me five months ago (including length of relationship). I then discovered there was another woman.

            "The fact that he brings up the dog would motivate me to give the dog away to a VERY trusted friend, and get all vet records updated to reflect as much until after the divorce. What a horrible threat to make. Divorce doesn't have to be ugly, and that statement is a HUGE red flag.",
            "I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not more angry to be honest. And I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying his smith and sweet behaviour now. Every time he\u2019s promised counselling or improving and hasn\u2019t come through, so I\u2019d just be careful and make sure you get a lawyer to protect yourself. ",
            "Do not let him use your dog as hostage, what a shitty thing to bring up straight away. It sounds like he had always been planning or thinking about this since you guys first discussed it 2 years ago as he already had everything planned out. Lawyer up.",

            "I feel like the way he approached the finances issue is concerning.  He doesn\u2019t have a 50/50 attitude at all and considering his coldness I think you need to get a brutal lawyer and don\u2019t let him trick you into a crappy settlement.\n\nIt feels like he was kind of trying to scare you by saying he could go for alimony or try to take your dog.  Those aren\u2019t the words of a kind or reasonable man.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard to imagine that you\u2019d have to fight hard on this and sometimes it feels like it might not be worth it to put up a fight, but let the lawyer do the hard stuff for you and make sure this guy doesn\u2019t stomp on your finances as well.",
            ">He brought up that he could probably technically fight for alimony but that he wouldn't. And said he wouldn't fight for my dog if I don't fight to go after his seperate finances.\n\nI'd be careful he doesn't start using the divorce to continue being cruel or one-up you.  Both those statements read as threats, \"don't touch my stuff or I'll stop being 'nice'\".  Maybe hit up /r/legaladvice,  Lundy Bancrofts' 'why does he do that' has stuff about divorces as well I think?  Pdf is online for free.  Cutting remarks about a spouse's intelligence aren't normal and there may have been emotional abuse going on.  Pretty sure there was given how exhausting that dude sounds but I dunno how you'd identify your situation personally.  I like the 'water torturer' excerpt from the Lundy Bancroft books for describing the subtle cruelty and putting it to words.",
            "LOL what alimony does an able bodied man think he's going to get? Go for 50% of everything. He used you to project an image as a married man and gave you only heart ache.",
            "This sucks. Sorry to see you go through that, but I'm glad that you're getting a new beginning. This guy was holding you back.",
            "I'm going through a similar situation with my last relationship, same issues of lack of sex, fights, all building up to that idea that he really didn't love me. Some days it's hard where I think about him and what I wanted us to be, wanting what we could have been if he just actually cared. But even though I want that fantasy dream world I know it will never be, at least not with him. And now that we are no longer together I have the opportunity to let go of those thoughts that I had for him and build myself a new, happier world view. It's a tough path, but I'm finding that it's worth it. These difficulties transform us into stronger people, it's how we grow; At least that's how I like to see it. I hope that everything works out for you. Good luck.",

            "Get a lawyer for the divorce.  Trust me.\n\nOn the dog thing, animals are treated as property, so what would realistically happen is that you would pay him a couple hundred dollars, and keep the dog.\n\nThe general rule is \"don't take legal advice from the opposition.\"  Most divorce lawyers can do a free consultation.  If not, it's worth every damn penny.",
            "It seems fishy to me that he wanted to keep all the finances separate, and that his initial reaction was to basically threaten you over the dog if you come after \"his\" money. I feel like he is really hiding something. \n\nI would consult an attorney in general and specifically about the dog. If there is a friend who can watch the dog while you iron out the house details and/or find a new place to live, I think that would be wise for the dog's sake. He clearly has no emotional ties to it, and given his anger issues I wouldn't leave the dog alone with him for a second.\n\nI would also go after his money, whatever you're legally entitled to, simply as payment for the atrocious way you were treated during the marriage and the psychological trauma you endured. It's fine to not want to be married, there's no excuse for treating others like crap because of it. ",

If he wasn't that invested into you or the marriage, he needed to step up, be honest with himself, his feelings, and you, and get out.  It sounds like this is someone that is emotionally immature.

            "I am a survivor of divorce from a marriage where I learned he never really loved me and married me \"because that's what people do\" / \"to keep me around\" / \"that's what he thought I wanted\" - all things I didn't know at the time and wished I had. I understand so well the pain you're in now. It really will lessen with time though it will probably take quite awhile. Also, it will probably affect your self-esteem and ability to trust the motives of others. I encourage you to continue counseling all through this process. That and connecting with friends, family, local supports will be critical for you - especially in the next year or two.  \n\n**NB: Get everything in writing regarding the dog. Animals are considered property, so you need legal recourse if he decides to keep / not let you see the dog (happened to me, broke my heart into pieces, and solidified my understanding of what a piece of shit he is).**",
            "Good for you. Seriously - good for you. You had the hard conversation. You faced his indifference. You're making plans. You're still breathing. Putting one foot in front of the other.\n\nI'm 49 and survived a divorce when I was in my early 30's - left with two young kids. There are a lot of folks (men and women) out there who have survived what you're going through - one way or another. It's brutal. Lost love. Plans dashed. Regrets. Fear. Shame even. But this is survivable, of course. Just terrible in the midst where you are now.\n\nHere's one tiny bit of advice I might offer. (in case you're interested!) I learned the hard way that I have a TYPE of man...and I made a few more mistakes in love before I figured this out. I like(d) unavailable men. The charismatic ones who are successful and have a lot going on. They want me, it seems, but they have a hard time making time for giving me the basic time/attention needed to maintain a relationship. I chased them - made it easy. Craved their attention and felt lucky to be the one these dazzlers had picked. In the end - it didn't work, of course. They too wanted someone they had to chase - and there I always was. The men I met who were DEVOTED and LOVELY and AVAILABLE to me? They bored me to tears. One guy sent me a text with a link to a song every morning - something to start my day. I was so uncomfortable. I preferred the guys who I had to chase and hope they'd text me back. Ugh!\n\nThe advice: be sure to try and learn from this experience/relationship. Yup - he was a jerk. But take some time to explore why this relationship (or lack of one) worked for you for so long. Or why you tolerated it. There are insights in there for you - and will make you more successful in future relationships if you can gain some glimpse of what went wrong on your end.\n\nThe good news: I'm 49 and in an AMAZING (5 year) relationship with a man who's older and counts himself lucky to be with me. He's got some of the other qualities I like (successful/driven/charismatic) but maybe because he's older and learned from his earlier relationships - he's very good at taking care of me in return. (and I let him!)\n\nGood luck, you got this!",

            "Gotta agree with the other commenters here. Get a fucking shark of a lawyer and fight him for all he is worth. Don't let him use the dog to screw you out of what is due to you. He probably doesn't even want the dog but saw it was an easy way to manipulate you. Divorce courts don't care about \"dog custody\" and since he's probably never taken the dog to a vet he'll have trouble arguing it was ever his.\n\nLawyer, lawyer, lawyer! I know you are very hurt and at a low moment for all he has put you through but you can't give up on fighting for what you deserve.\n\nI strongly believe he is currently scheming to screw you over. He is a very manipulative person who does not care about you at all. Treat him accordingly and protect yourself against it",

I've also dated some of the most beautiful women you can imagine. One in particular was probably that one love that comes around once in a lifetime.

            "Like others I was in a similar relationship.  My ex thought I wasn't \"invested \" enough in the relationship and she was right but it was because everything was so tedious with her. Anyways we finally go to marriage counseling(she demanded that I take the initiative to set this up). The counselor was very neutral, helpful and our first session was great. So, we get into the car and she turns to me and says, \"I didn't realize I had so much to work on.\". \n\nThe next day she tells me she isn't going back to counseling which effectively ends the marriage. \n\nI definitely had my own issues and things to work on. I  always owned up to my faults and apologized and tried to better myself. I realized that my ex wanted to use the counseling to blame everything on me which is extremely immature.  In our relationship she never apologized for anything it was always \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" and I was always at fault for everything. \n\nAnyways, sometimes two people are not compatible even if nothing catastrophic happens in the relationship.   The earlier it ends assuming you aren't going to work on it the better. Count your blessings, learn the lessons about yourself that are important because whatever your ex did or didn't do won't matter in the future when they exit your life. ",

            "I really feel for you. I was in a similar one-sided marriage, where it felt like all I did was try to figure out the things I could do to change the situation and make it work.  He was verbally and emotionally abusive, which was somehow even more painful in the face of what I felt were sometimes extreme personal sacrifices I was making. I felt like a puppet. I was also very hard on myself bc I told myself on many occasions\u2014after making whatever random change he told me would make things better\u2014that maybe I hadn\u2019t heard him correctly? Maybe I hadn\u2019t changed the right thing? Or done it fast enough, or well enough? Meanwhile, my life had no resemblance of the one I wanted. He was a constant gaslighter, too, who I think genuinely believed the lies he told himself and me. In the end, I left him too. Afterward, I took some time to reflect on why I made the choices I did, in that relationship and in life in general. \n\nI\u2019m dating again now, I finally started the career I put on hold to take care of him (which he resented, ofc), and I\u2019m raising our daughter who will be 4 this month on my own. My life is harder in some ways, but it\u2019s also better because *it\u2019s mine*. I\u2019ll make whatever choices and mistakes I make because it\u2019s what I want, not in order to try to steer the unpredictable chaos in a particular direction, or to please him, which was impossible. I\u2019m also young enough that I feel I have a full life ahead of me, and I feel I\u2019m wiser for what I\u2019ve been through, so it\u2019ll be a good one, filled with more healthy choices. \n\nGood luck to you, and congratulations! I know that may not seem like the appropriate word given how you\u2019re feeling right now, but trust me, it is. You made the hard choice, but also the smart one.

Like you, I had the gut feeling something wasnt right and struggled with it. He would much rather spend all day in bed playing video games and sleep than watch a movie with me or go out to a movie. Anything I was into, he had to pretend to be interested in. Go fig.\n\nThose feelings of losing your self worth is always hard in these kinds of situations, I think. Even harder when you're getting screamed at and called nasty things or being torn down for doing nothing wrong other than wanting to love someone honestly and openly. I had a hard time just dealing with it for mine, you're very strong for doing it as long as you did. Your inner strength is something to definitely commend.\n\nThe fact that you more than happily took care of your nieces shows the world what an amazing soul you are and shame on him for trying to disrespect that! Those girls needed to k ew they weren't alone and thankfully you were there to show them that they weren't. That it was still ok to move forward and learn to be happy. I think you're seriously amazing for that.\n\nSeriously, if he felt like he'd rather be alone, it's always best to just say so, even if it hurts. Lying to keep up a pretense will always be found out. And it makes the betrayal worse.\n\nEven though I'm way happier now, I cant help but to wonder why people do that.. just act like the shattering of another person's spirit is just a-ok. For me, its cuz my ex is a narc who tried to backpedal the second I agreed to ending the farce of a relationship. Why stay in a relationship where you are the only one trying? I think in a way, yours is similar? Maybe he wanted to keep the pretense that his life was peachy so he wouldn't have to be honest or open himself up to whatever his true inner demons are. But his a major twatwaffle for dragging you around this long.\n\nSorry if this is kinda rambly. I really meant to say that I think you're an amazing person and I know that it'll get better for you.

            "OMG.... you and I are living parallel lives. I am two months in from walking out on my husband and dead bedroom. It took TWO long years of fighting for his affection and attention, and an endless struggle of figuring out how to make him happy. So much stress and fighting, and effort, and trying to solve all the was wrong. And the realizing I was the only one putting any effort into any of it. \nI worked so hard, and worried, and cried, and prayed...and lost myself in the process. I slowly let everything I loved just melt away in order to keep the peace. I stopped seeing friends, I never had anyone over. For the last two years of our relationship, I walked on eggshells every single day trying to figure out what he needed and wanted. \n\n\nAnd then my Dad died. He was the primary caregiver for my Mom who has Alzheimer's. It was such a shock because as a family, my brother and aiayers were expecting my Moms illness to be the worst thing, and then we lost Dad. I'm still reeling from it. I came home from the hospital after seeing his body, and my husband asked if I thought he needed to take time off from work. He asked do I really need him at the wake and funeral....because it would be a day off with pay, and we need the money \". I was DUMBFOUNDED. \n\n\nAnd to make a long story short, yes he worked during the wake, and I was alone thru most of it and the funeral. And we never recovered. It was literally the last nail in the coffin. \n\nIt took a few months, and several brutal arguments, but eventually one day I just walked out.  I parked a bag and slept on my sisters couch for a month. I got a plan together and moved my things out and found a place. In the end, I had a few things, the clothes on my back, a new apartment and $14.00 left. Scary. But I  had to. I couldn't survive it another day.\n\nAnd I sit here now in my new apartment and I'm still shell-shocked. I feel utterly broken. I know I should be happy to be out-and I am, but I am fighting the aftermath. The silence in my house, the loneliness, depression, sadness, regret for even getting married, and fear of a future alone. I am tired, forty pounds overweight, and I feel rudderless. I have no fingernails left to bite. When I pass a mirror. ... I don't recognize myself at all. Not at all. I lost so fucking much to this bad relationship. \n\nBut I try to remind myself that I just reclaimed MY life, and I am just recharging. I am in a state of repair. It won't always be like this. I just need to put time in to heal. I know I should jump right in to fixing me, and not get lazy, and work to get the weight off ....but I feel so exhausted. \n\nAnyway, I just need to say thank you. Thanks for making me feel less alone in this. You will make it thru to the other side and put all of this behind you. ",

            "Though my situation wasn\u2019t exactly the same, I too was married for 8 years to a man that I realized never loved me. It was one of the most painful experiences I\u2019ve had to go through. Like you I had given that relationship my all and he made it clear that nothing I did was ever good enough.  When the breakup happened he was downright giddy while he gathered his things. I felt humiliated that I thought he would have fought to keep us together.  That an impending breakup would trigger the changes he always promise but never made.  The reality was a new girlfriend for him and single motherhood for me. \n\nDivorce sucks but mine gave me an opportunity to create a new, more fulfilling life centered around my needs. I hope you do the same. You deserve someone who appreciates you and I wish you the best. ",
            "Your husband loved you during your marriage, whether it be consistently or at random moments, but he loved you. We have a way of changing our memories of a person based off of how we feel at the time (the mood could have been caused by another person or even some sort of internal happiness struggle). Him saying he married you simply because it was the right life path at the time sounds like a cop out. He is hurt, but has decided apathy, emotional numbness, and distance to be his best coping mechanisms at this time. Reflect on your marriage and I bet you can find times you two are happy. You were right for each other at the time, but you two simply grew in two separate directions. This is an opportunity to foster even more growth as an aunt which will give you more confidence to grow in other areas of your life. Many blessings to you!",

            "This happened to me too. For the last (and only the second) year of our marriage, there was no sex. I killed my self jumping through hoops, trying everything I could think of to be attractive to him. None of it mattered because I found out after our divorce that he\u2019d been having an affair with a coworker. Even when I was pregnant with our son. \n\nI would have stayed with him. Now I\u2019m glad he left me for her. Even though it hurt like hell. It still does sometimes but it\u2019s honestly manageable compared to the pain of being in that relationship and driving myself insane wondering why I wasn\u2019t good enough. \n\nHim and the coworker got married and had a baby.

I'm confident you will come out of this a stronger person, because it sounds like you already are. \n\nMy own personal mantra that has served me well throughout my life is \"don't waste time on people who won't waste time on you.\" Time is the most valuable thing anyone has, and people will either try to steal it, waste it or hopefully add value to your time. I really truly realized this after I almost died a few years back.  \n\nThere will never be a \"good time\" to do anything in life, just when you decide to or not. May you find solace in your life moving forward. \n\n&#x200B;",
            "I honestly think for tales like this, is why marriage is just not right into todays society with greater freedoms. You're negative gut feeling and lack of sex, or general lack of you not getting what you want, should persuade you quicker to seek what you do want instead. Furthermore who will give you that, and it clearly wasn't this guy for a long time. However, marriage (and obviously his sisters passing) halted you doing that, but I feel you should have made the decision a lot earlier, but the notion of marriage makes people suffer unhappiness for longer. \n\nI think in longer term people should consistently evaluate is this working for each other? I am currently in an open relationship for a year or so after being together with my girlfriend for 7.5 years, and this is just one example that ensures you get what you want in life yet having your rock of each other in the relationship. Totally won't work for everyone, but just giving one example how your individuality in life never is superceded by a relationship or marriage in my opinion. Of course there will be attempts to compromise and there should be, but if you conclude you're missing something, just losing it is going to result in unhappiness long term and an unsuccessful relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou come across as a tremendously caring person and thoughtful, and you've kept in shape as you say!! There will be a truck load of people wanting to share that with you, and you deserve to have that. I think you have highlighted an interesting broader issue however that marriage really feels outdated in today's society, and a more fluid dynamic really is the way forward. Seek happiness, don't overdo compromise in your own life, it will result in a negative lifestyle for both.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck in your future :)",

When he said he could ask for alimony makes me  think he hiding something. Maybe a some distance from him after the divorce will lessen the grieving process. In future relationships talk; get to know thier hopes, dreams, and life stories. This is important; no commitments until you see how he interacts with his family; you can tell a lot by a mother son relationship. I wish you a Hallmark channel ending. ",

            "Well, I applaud your thoroughness in your efforts to fix your marriage. Now you won't have to wonder if you did everything you could. Ultimately, one thing out of all that you said stands out to me, \"I should have listened to my gut all along.\" From your conversation, it's clear that you are very consious and emotionally aware, but you had hung a partition to block your sight when it came to your husband. I know how easy it is to do that since we make certain determinations about our other half and they become like the basic laws and foundation for how we see them and predict their reactions or responses. You revealed that when you said you saw him through a different lense also. I don't know what you look like, but if your post is any fair indication about your personality and traits, you certainly possess a great many of the most attractive, such as, loyalty, objectivity, careful consideration for others, compassion that exceeds your own need to receive, you like dogs+, you seem diplomatic in your approach to problem solving, but probably put yourself last too often for the sake of others. So basically, you sound like a Libra to me. Not because I am a Libra as much as I recognizdle the behaviors from personal experience being me. Soo, moving right along now, I think you have handled the situation well and step by step is how you proceed until you find you have been in full stride and everything\nelse is behind you on the path. The great news is that if you are only 32, then you are prime and have time to attract plenty of attention.

Do your best to see the eyerolls for what they are; don\u2019t grant manipulation the benefit of the doubt. You\u2019ll learn from this, and you\u2019ll grow stronger for it. \n\nAlso. Your ex is HIGHLY manipulative. The comment about your dog was a thinly veiled threat. He\u2019s trying to put the thought in your head that he COULD take your dog and that he COULD take your money - he\u2019s warning you in order to make you agree with his demands. Get on that shit immediately. Consult a lawyer and never take your ex\u2019s word for anything. \n\nBest of luck. You\u2019ll do amazing without him. ",

Especially it he's taking any medications for a long time, just google meds he's taking to see if they could cause low-t.  When I got my low t fixed, I felt great, like myself again with a full personality, vs. being easily stressed, agitated, not into sex, and emotionally flat.  \n\nIf you don't want to be with him, obviously you should move on, but you might suggest to him to get tested from a health-perspective.

He was really happy for me, like a lot of people said he would be. When I told him I got in he gave me a huge hug and was really excited. It was such a huge relief. \n\nHe asked me if it was my top choice, since he didn't know I had applied. I told him it was and he said that we have to celebrate then. He told me I didnt seem excited enough and I should be really proud of myself, and he asked if it was the shock of just finding out. \n\nWhen I told him I find out a few days ago and he was the only one that knew he asked me whats going on, because I wasnt reacting to the great news like it was great news. I admitted that I worried about telling him because I didnt want him to be mad. \n\nWe talked about it and he basically said what everyone in the comments said, that he's proud of me and happy for me. I mentioned that I got into a different program than his and my requirements were lower, and he told me to not downplay my success and to stop worrying about him being mad because he wasn't. He told me that when I told out parents he wanted me to be more confident and proud of myself, because I did something great. \n\n Yesterday while we were hanging out at his buddy's house he told me I should tell them the news, when I didnt want to because I hate talking about myself he asked if could tell them, which I told him was OK. they were all happy for me too. Honestly, he's reaction was better than I even hoped for, but looking back I should have expected it from him because that's always been the type of brother he is.\n\nTL;DR told my brother I got into the university and he incredibly supportive and happy for me. He told me not limit my success to make other people more comfortable, and that he was proud of me (which meant a lot to hear).",

            "Congrats! Good on your brother for being understanding. When I applied to grad school, a close friend, who is also a coworker, applied with me. One morning I received a text that my u oversight email account and Web ID was set ... which means I\u2019m enrolled. My friend texted me shortly after and said she got a letter of denial from the university in the mail. She ask if I heard anything about my application. I wanted so bad to tell her not yet but it was inevitable that she would know eventually. So I told her and she said \u201cyou are in then. I\u2019m happy for you.\u201d It made me feel bad but it is what it is. She never made good grades or did well with research papers and those were two of the main criteria. She convinced herself it was something unrelated to academics so I just listened to her. She\u2019s great at her job and a good person. \n\nThankfully, she did get into an online program elsewhere a couple years later. ",
            "Baby bro, wait until you all hit the job market. You find out in life that brothers can't be jealous about schools, careers, or relationships. Opportunities just kinda happen by chance; it's how well you use the chances you get.\n\nOh, but you do have to invite him over for a party weekend (if you both like to go). It's The Code.",
            "You're a good brother! Good luck at University!\n\nFun side story: since my brother and I are twins we decided not to apply to each other's top school choices",
            "Congratulations! I'm so glad that he's proud of you and I really truly believe that he is.\n\nI totally understand where you were coming from and your concerns were justified, so it's nice to see that other people can surprise you sometimes.\n\nI was in a similar situation when I found out I was pregnant. My best friend of almost 20 years has been trying for a REALLY long time and has never been successful and we got it on our first try. I was PETRIFIED to tell her, but she couldn't have been more pleased. She thanked me for my concern and felt bad that I was hesitant to tell her at all as she couldn't have been more happy for us.\n\nThe good ones will always be on your side. x",

He is what I failed to do along the road, not saying I won\u2019t get back to it, but he is the image of a person who I envisioned myself to be. I didn\u2019t go to college, I went to a trade school because I wanted to be a blue collar worker, but that kid, that fucking kid makes me proud and happy when he succeeds, even if he succeeds where I have failed. Your brother loves you deeply dude, and I don\u2019t think you understand how deep, you guys are young, but trust me, you really and genuinely make him happy when you succeed.",

I wanted to give everyone an update, since the advice on this sub was really helpful at the time.\n\n\n\nFor a few months after I wrote my OP, nothing much happened. Jeff and I continued dating, and he continued being friends/partners with Jenna. I never met her, but everything else in our relationship seemed to be going so well that I decided I'd try to deal with it.\n\n\n\nThings got really hard, however, when I had to take a work contract 12 hours away from home for three months. I hardly saw Jeff the whole time, and I looked at Jenna's instagram almost every day to see if she'd posted more photos of them together. More often than not, she had. Since I wasn't physically present, I felt like Jenna was his real girlfriend. I felt completely worthless and constantly stressed out, knowing my boyfriend was spending all his time with another woman who I already had suspicions about.\n\n\n\nWhile I was away for work, I decided to break up with Jeff. I broke up with as soon as I came back, and I made it very clear that his relationship with Jenna was intolerable for me. I told him he was going to have a hard time dating anyone who wasn't her as long as she was still in his life. He kept saying he didn't understand why it was such a problem. He told me he couldn't control her behaviour, but he promised me he hadn't cheated on me. I explained to him that by allowing their friendship to continue, he was condoning her behaviour. I told him I didn't really even care if he'd physically cheated or not, since he'd already shown disrespect for me and our relationship. \n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't speak to him for a few months and I went on with my life. I took another contract out of town and even considered moving permanently to another city. One night, though, Jeff called me and apologized. He said he had been thinking about our relationship a lot and realized he had been in the wrong. He said his relationship with Jenna was beginning to feel toxic to him, and he'd made arrangements to dissolve their business partnership. After that, I decided to meet up with him (not necessarily give him another chance) and discuss the situation further. When we met up, he promised to stop talking to Jenna and unfollowed her on all social media.\n\n\n\n\nAs of now, he has not spoken to her in six months, and we've gotten back together. We actually ran into her at a concert a few weeks ago, and they didn't even say hi to each other. I feel much more respected and confident in my relationship now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: I broke up with my boyfriend. He ended his friendship/partnership with his ex and we have gotten back together.",

To be honest at first I didn't care that he had a female best friend that he spends time with but after getting those messages I told him to sort his priorities out and that I wasn't gonna deal with this childish behaviour. He cut all contact with her and haven't heard from her till 2 years ago when I saw her at a meeting at work. Turns out she got hired in the same company I work at and we even had to spend 3 months at the same location everyday. At first it was awkward but it got better.

            "I'm actually really surprised to hear you got back together, but I guess the distance (and the fact you legitimately broke up with him, not just \"take a break\") gave him the space to grow up and take another look at his behaviour. Best wishes for you both!",

            "He was refusing to see it from anyone else's perspective until you two stopped dating!",
            "> He told me he couldn't control her behaviour, \n\nBogus. He can control *his* behavior and break up with his work-wife. He can stop making you be the one to accommodate her. He can say, \"Jenna, I'm stopping by with OP to grab something,\" and then stop by instead of walking you around for half an hour. It's called setting boundaries. He didn't have to dissolve the business to do it, although the business might have dissolved as a result. It's all in the past now, but I don't think he really learned how to set boundaries, just how to avoid the necessity.",

And if my partner put another woman's needs ahead of mine, I'd have to walk. \n\nWhen you have healthy boundaries and healthy self-respect, you get treated better. Not because you're forcing people to do what you want, but because you're limiting their ability to hurt or mistreat you. I'm glad he saw his error and that things are going well between you. Congratulations!",

            "Great job!!! I\u2019m struggling with this. My ex wants to be friends, but if his first date goes well tomorrow, I don\u2019t want her to think I\u2019m anything more than an acquaintance. My ex gets upset when I want to reduce our friendship. But I can\u2019t stand for anyone to think I would do anything to harm another person. \n\n\nI\u2019m happy to see that things worked out for you. And I\u2019m happy to see he realized Jenna was toxic. Congratulations and may you always be happy! ",

            "I'm so glad it worked out! He sounds like a nice guy who was involved in a toxic friendship. Sometimes it seems like he was in the wrong (by condoning her behavior), but when you're friends with someone and working with them, it can be hard to not let the things they do slide. I think your break up and your comment on how he'll never be able to date anyone really opened his eyes and that's why he dropped the friendship and won you back. I hope your relationship is a great one!",
            "im so glad to hear everything went well. some people just need to face consequences to realise how hurt the other person is. i wish you to all the best.",
            "It\u2019s weird that she didn\u2019t want to meet you, but it also seems extreme to me that you would break up with him over it and it\u2019s also weird that he would dump his so-called best friend so quickly. I would worry that if I asked my partner to stop seeing their best friend, that my partner would resent me for it in the long run.",

I got some great advice, I got a lot of tough love advice and some terrible advice. I know he was already committed by all of his actions and that I really needed to focus on college first before having to plan a wedding. \n\nWell, it turned out my boyfriend at the time had been planning on proposing to me for a long time. He wanted to wait until I graduated college. A little after I graduated college, he took me on a hike. I knew this was a special hike because it was the same place we went for one of our earlier dates. \n\nThe first time we went on that date was magical. I always teased him that he never kissed me on the date. There was this perfect moment he was holding me in front of a beautiful picturesque lake as we were just enjoying each other's company in an embrace. I thought he was going to kiss me but he didn't. \n\nI later kissed him first but always teased him that he didn't kiss me in that moment we had. He confessed he wasn't sure if I wanted to be kissed. He said he wanted to kiss me more than anything. \n\nWell he took me back on the hike 4 years later, and when we got to that lake, he told me this is when he knew he was first in love with me. Then he got on one knee and proposed to me. I just kissed him and even forgot to say yes! So he asked, \"Are you going to marry me or not?\" And I said of course. We got married about a year later and we just celebrated our one year anniversary in October. \n\nI've never been happier and I'm so excited to continue our life together! \n\nThank you for reading \ud83d\ude01\n\nEdit: Grammar on TL DR\n\nEdit: Wow! I did not expect this post to blow up like it did! Thank you all for the incredibly kind words. I'm sorry I can't respond to everyone but thank you. I'm glad I could brighten so many people's day! You all brightened mine :)\n\nTL;DR UPDATE: My [24] boyfriend [25] of 3 and 1/2 years hadn't proposed and I was starting to worry. This is a two year update that my boyfriend at the time was planning on proposing all along. We have now been married for one year. I am so happy everything worked out the way it did. ",

            "\\> I just kissed him and even forgot to say yes! \n\nI forgot to say yes, too lol. I don't know if I ever saw your first post or not, but I was very similar - except I was 29 and my friends were starting to have babies, much less engaged or married... we had been together 5 years and we had talked about it a lot, but it was never the 'right time'!! Our anniversary is October too, just celebrated 3 years :-). My now-husband proposed at the top of my favorite lighthouse and I totally forgot to say yes, I just hugged him and cried and kissed him over and over. Patience and not comparing your life to anyone else's is key - you're on no one else's timetable but your own, it's not a race. You and I both had to learn that lesson, and we're better off for it. I wish you a strong and bright future together!",

I think you guys were young and I agree with all the comments from the original post. \n\nSeems kind of manipulative to get all upset about not getting married like you\u2019re trying really hard to trap him. \n\nI think if you\u2019re so worried about marriage that you think your relationship won\u2019t work without it you\u2019re too immature to be in a relationship in the first place.

            "A true, lasting relationship would AND should work without marriage.\n\nIf it takes a ring, a proposal, and legal papers to give you a sense of stability to your relationship; then maybe you are you in denial?",
            "Reddit is quick to jump on the break up boat. I asked reddit for advice because we were coming up on 10 years without a proposal (we started dating when I was 13) and they told me to drop my boyfriend like a hot potato. I even reassured that we have no issue and have stated over and over that we are life partners to each other. 9/10 comments told me to break up. I ended up approaching my partner and saying it was time. He didn't see how getting married changes anything for us and didn't want to plan/have a wedding. We ended up going on a 3 week elopement to Japan instead of having a wedding and got our papers signed during a small family celebration brunch on our 10 year dating anniversary. We even had a custom sapphire engagement ring made. It is amazing what you can afford to do if you don't have to budget for a big wedding.",

That would scare the hell out of me, hopefully it didnt for him.\n\nWish you both the best!",

He was crestfallen his gift for me hadn\u2019t shipped in time, so instead, took me on a hiking trail, also reminiscent of one of the first dates we\u2019d been on.  Goodness that man can act.

            "This is super encouraging because I\u2019m in the exact same boat (3.5 years and everything!) and I\u2019m hoping that he just has some greater plan in mind. ",
            "Wait but what was the advice?",
            "I didn\u2019t really resonate with the urgency to want to be engaged in your early 20s until I read what you wrote about wanting your parents to be grandparents so badly. I feel that, mine are aging too and life is just so unpredictable. If you know then you know, if you don\u2019t want to wait, then don\u2019t wait. I hope you have the family you dream of and that your parents get to be grandparents! ",
            "You are graduating soon, time to get a job and pull your weight financially, after that he can see a better financial picture of your future together. Shower him with gifts and your time just like he does, be his equal ASAP. This should help quiet your insecurities for sometime.\n\nTalk to him about your fears about having kids, start family planning and wedding.\n\nRings are expensive and peer pressure is there for size and design, weddings are stupidly expensive and personally I think a waste. I pushed back my wedding date twice already.",
