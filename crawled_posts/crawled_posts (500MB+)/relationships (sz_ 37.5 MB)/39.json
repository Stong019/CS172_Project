        "selftext": "What really happened: I was very sick four years ago and was in need of a liver transplant. My situation was that it was very unlikely that I would get one in time. At that time my sister was pregnant. I didn't know as it was early (less than two months). My situation was getting worse and my sister decided to do an abortion and then two months later we did the transplant surgery.\n\nI never knew about the pregnancy. All I knew was that she gave me half of her liver. My sister and her husband divorced a year later. I didn't know the truth until yesterday when my mom slipped up about an abortion that my sister had. I asked her about it and she told me everything. She told me that my sister made her promise not to tell me and she failed that promise.\n\nMy sister was very happy. My brother in law was a very decent guy. I knew they were looking forward to having children. They were great together. She always told us about how lucky she is to have found him.\n\nApparently at the time of their decision, my sister and her husband had great disagreement. He didn't want her to have the abortion and risk the transplant surgery and was hopeful that my situation might sort itself out without my sister's help. The chance was very small but it was there. My sister didn't agree. They couldn't convince one another and my sister did things anyway without his blessing. They tried working things out after the surgery, they went to counseling, they even tried to have another baby but they couldn't get themselves to do it. He couldn't forgive my sister and she wasn't all that apologetic so they ended up separating and eventually divorcing.\n\nMy sister isn't happy now. Hasn't been since the surgery. She never told me the real reason for her divorce. She told me that they were after different things. I just learned things from my mom. I asked my mom if my sister still thinks that she did the right thing. She said \"she's not sure\".\n\nI can't stop feeling guilty. My sister saved my life but destroyed her own life doing it. She had to abort the baby she definitely loved and looked forward to and did that knowing that it will probably end her marriage as well. I was ready to go at that time. I had accepted my fate and I was at peace. She should have just let me. Shit. My brother in law should have told me so I would have talked her out of it. I'm surprised he didn't. I can't feel anything but to hate myself.\n\nI don't know what to do. Should I talk to my sister? What should I tell her? Should I keep my mouth shut and pretend that I don't know? I'm not sure if I'll even be able to look into her eyes and not show that I know. I just don't know what the fuck I should do.\n\nPlease please help me.\n\n**tl;dr**: My sister did an abortion be able to give me part of her liver and saved my life, but it costed her marriage. ",

            "In case you want counseling, you can contact the hospital that did the surgery and they'll be able to help. They have counsellors who are experienced with issues around transplants from living donors.\n\nBut regarding your sister, yes you should tell her. It's a burden on you and on her. Just go and talk to her. Tell her how you feel, she'll tell you how she feels, and it will bring you both closer together. It's a very difficult situation where nobody is at fault and it's very unfortunate that her marriage ended that way. But you both can heal together. ",
            "Your sister made an impossible choice. Either way, she was risking losing a family member. There is not outcome here that would have made everyone happy. And, despite the guilt you feel, you weren't in control of any of the decisions she made. Do you really believe you could have convinced your sister to let you die when she had the ability to save you? \n\nI know it's usually the go-to here, but therapy seems like it would be a good first step. You just received a lot of intense, emotional and heartbreaking information. You need time to process and figure out how you feel outside of your guilt. And if you try to address this situation on your own right now, you risk damaging your relationship with your sister long term because this needs to be handled very delicately. You may run the risk of saying the wrong thing unintentionally.  ",
            "Damn your sister is a legend man. That's all I can say.",
            "Don't hate yourself. I have two young sons who I love to the ends of the earth...but when I was less than two months pregnant I would have done the same thing to save my brother's life. I do think you should talk to her. Hug her. Tell her you're so sorry. DO NOT tell her that she shouldn't have done it. Or that you're blaming yourself. Then she'll wish your mom had kept her promise and it will make it even worse. Maybe you could ask her if she's considered counseling - I'm sure she desperately needs it if she hasn't had any. She still has the rest of her life ahead of her - and thanks to the decisions she made. So do you.\n\nEdited because that was the worst typo.",
            "I don't think you should consider it that your situation CAUSED them to divorce as if it was an inevitability.\n\nI think my marriage would have survived this situation. I think there are many here whose marriages would have. What your situation did was bring your sister ave her husband to a crossroads where they discovered some fundamental incompatibilities in their relationship. That may well have happened sooner or later anyway.",
            "Your sister did the right thing, and you should be proud of her, and feel so lucky to have a sister like her.\n\nPut yourself in her shoes. You have a sister who is *dying*, with very little chance of surviving if she doesn't get the liver she needs.\n\nYou just got pregnant - hooray! But you're the only person who can save your sister's life, and it will cost you the pregnancy. Damn.\n\nBut you can get pregnant again. 75% of pregnancies end in miscarriages, most of the time without the mother even knowing, and few of those women are rendered infertile by it.\n\nSo you know that, while it's sad, you can always try again for another baby - but if you let your sister die, you'll never have another sister again. Easy decision, right?\n\nExcept you've got a husband, and he's actually telling you that you should roll the dice, almost certainly watch your own sister die in a hospital, just because he wants *this* particular fetus, who is not a person, to take priority over your living, breathing sister - even though there's *nothing* preventing him from making another, even though losing a child in early pregnancy is common as it is.\n\nSo you've got this man, who is basically telling you to *kill* your own sister or he'll leave you.\n\nYou know what? *Fuck that guy*. In her shoes, would you ever pick a man like that over your own sister? If you had let your sister die when you could have saved her, would you ever be able to forgive yourself?\n\nShe did the right thing - for you, *and* for herself.\n\nIf it was me, I would tell her that I know - without throwing Mom under the bus too much - and I would thank her for giving me my *life*. She's been keeping this from you the whole time because she doesn't want you to feel guilty - and the consequence for her is that she hasn't been able to talk to you about any of it.\n\nThank her. Let her cry on your shoulder. Let her know that you truly owe her your life, and that you are the luckiest sister on the planet. Mourn the pregnancy, mourn the marriage, don't talk bad about the ex. But know in your heart of hearts that that man wasn't good for her, and that he could never have raised children who would be so closely bonded as you and your sister are.\n\nEdit for a couple clarifications:\n- I was way off on my claim about how many pregnancies fail to complete. Read the comment chain for a very good breakdown of *exactly* how wrong I am.\n- I was being a little flip when I implied that anything about terminating a pregnancy would be an easy decision, and I apologize for that.",
            "Hopefully you'll see this.\n\nHave you ever heard of the hindsight bias? We use it colloquially in media nowadays but it has real emotional and cognitive impacts on us in real life.\n\nEssentially what you're doing is, you're hating yourself for something you did not know and could not know 4 years ago. You are giving 4-year-ago-you the same knowledge/mindset of present-you. And present-you knows so much more than past-you. And that's not fair to hold past-you up to the same standards as present-you. Because that is impossible, that's not how time or life works. So stop beating yourself up over not being able to achieve the impossible. Because no one can achieve that. Instead, have some grace towards your past-self with the wisdom you have as your present-self.\n\nI know words are easy and actions are hard, but I just wanted to at least put that thought in your head.\n\nYou'll be ok, I promise. So will your sister. ",
            "Does anyone think it was pretty shitty of the mom to tell OP her sister doesn't know if she made the right choice? Who tells someone that?! ",
            "Look, I know you feel terrible, but your sister is an adult. The choice she made at the time was her own, and it was a very noble one. She chose to save you, her brother, whom she clearly loves very much. She knew what she was risking when she decided to donate her liver to you, accepted those consequences, and chose to do it anyway like the incredible sister she is. It's terrible that her marriage fell apart and that her husband chose to leave, but that's not on you. That's their relationship, so there's no need for you to feel guilty. Talk to your sister, be there for her like she was there for you, encourage her to go out and meet new people and find things that make her happy. She's clearly an amazing person who deserves another amazing person to share her life with, but for now just enjoy the time with her that she gifted you with her donation. ",
            "Oh honey.\n\nPlease know that divorce is complicated. It's never just one thing that leads to it. We tend to hyper focus on one thing while we're in the middle of it all, but it's never just one thing. If your sister and her ex husband weren't meant to be, that had a lot less to do with you than you're thinking.\n\nYour sister is an angel. Were it me and my sister, I would do the same thing, no question. It's a no brainer. I have a toddler and am currently pregnant, and if there was anything I could do to save my sister's life, including an abortion, I would do it. ",
            "Your sister made the choice to save your life, at whatever costs she was willing to make. She did it because she loves you and she knew there would be risks involved, especially with her marriage if they had talked about it. In saying that, this was her choice. You didn't ask her to get an abortion to donate half her liver to you. She chose to. And she did it because she loves you. You shouldn't feel guilty, her having an abortion and eventually divorcing, is in no way your fault. ",
            "I just want you to know that \"she's not sure\" is not the same as regretting her decision. You're safe. She's able to torture herself with hypotheticals because the reality is that you are safe and that isn't changed by any scenario her mind can run.\n\nSo talk to her, comfort her, grieve with her. Let her know she doesn't need to hide her pain from you. Not because you caused this or owe her, but because your sibling is hurting and you'd walk through fire for each other.",
            "She loves you, so you better go give her a big hug.",
            "Honestly, I feel that if you do talk to her do not express anything but gratitude because showing regret for her decision after she lost so much to make sure you lived will just be a slap in the face. \n\nIf someone sacrifices themselves for you, don't ever tell them you wish they hadn't, because to them it'll just seem like ingratitude.\n\nAbsolutely do not tell her you hate yourself. She gave up her potential child's life for you. So for her to hear that she gave that life up for yours and you're not even appreciating your own life..most likely she'll just be insulted by that.",
            "I would do the same thing for my little sister, in a heartbeat. She loves you, in a very powerful way. She likely couldn't imagine her life without you. Please just talk to her, get into therapy, so you can love yourself as much as she loves you. She did an amazing, selfless thing. Her husband could have stood by her but didn't. Divorce is complicated, as someone else mentioned. Don't blame yourself. ",
            "Your sister had a tough choice, but although she was pregnant she risked losing her little brother. We can see from her actions that she couldn't bare to lose you and wanted to help you. There's no reason to look at the risks of her surgery if nothing come of it. You're clearly very special to her and she loves you dearly. \n\n Ultimately she probably saw it as being as simple as being able to make another baby at a later date. She couldn't have known her marriage would break down but I do know that it's likely...although her actions concerning you were an issue in her marriage, it's likely there were other factors at play too - perhaps not as big as the abortion but if there was only one thing at play and they remained married for a year after, I'd imagine other smaller things may have contributed to the bigger picture. \n\n You have an amazing sister. She didn't tell you any of this because she knew you'd blame yourself or not want her to go through with it, initially for the abortion and now the marriage. The thing is you know now. If I were you I'd talk to her. \n\n I don't think there's any good to come from pretending you don't know. Don't be angry or upset but talk to her. If you need help comprehending the fallout from your chance at life, /u/LilaLaLina offers sound advice. Don't completely rule out counselling because it can help but I believe the first step towards lifting the weight from your shoulders *and* your sisters is talking to each other. \n\n **Nobody** is at fault here. I don't doubt you can get through this stronger together. As much as your sister is amazing for what she's done, you're equally amazing for caring so much about your sister and what's happened to her. You already have a strong family bond, this can only make you stronger because you clearly both care a lot about each other. ",
            "I'd have done the same thing as your sister. No way could I watch my brother dying if I could do something to save him. You can get pregnant again, and it was only 2 months along, who knows if it was viable. \n\nThere's always more to a divorce than what meets the eye. I couldn't stay with a guy that wanted to risk my brother's life like that, regardless. ",
            "She values your life, someone who was living, known, and already loved by many, more than the would-be life of her unborn child that nobody knew about. \n\nShe knew she'd have other chances to give birth and love a kid. But she'll never have another you... imagine the guilt she'd feel if she never took the risk of the surgery?\n\nYou can talk to her. Not sure what you should say, but try to console her and thank her. Telling her \"I was ready to go, you didn't have to do that\" wouldn't help her feel better would it? Wouldn't that just make her more confused and hurt MORE about her sacrifice?\n\nAnyway, be grateful for your life and don't waste it being sad. Try to help her out of her slump. Nobody knows the true depths of issues in her relationship outside of what they know about the disagreement about what to do about you, but you're her brother, not his, so he had no right to fight her or \"not forgive\" her. However, it was his right to leave her. It was also his potential child, and probably made him sad. Maybe he couldn't get past that when he looked at her, even after the counseling. But there also means their values are different and it's not your fault or even hers. They weren't meant to be together if he couldn't work past that, which is ok.\n\nHopefully she finds someone more compatible. But you gotta date to meet someone, so there's that!",
            "Mate, at the time her options were \"watch her brother most likely die and maybe have a healthy baby a few months later\" (these things aren't always certain), or \"terminate and give her brother a reasonable shot at life\".\n\nThere is nothing you can say or do to change how things panned out. For the love of all that is sacred don't mention this to your sister - she probably didn't want you to be burdened or have you looking at her with pity. She did the best she could with the information she had at the time.\n\nIf it does come out you know, say you're terribly sorry about the huge personal toll it took on her, but that you're grateful. And that you didn't want to mention it because she asked your mum not to say anything and wanted to respect that.\n\nPerhaps see it as a blessing in disguise: Your ex BIL sounds particularly heartless with his expectation your sister should have put his feelings and a small cluster of cells above her own brother *who was literally dying*. Seriously, your sister is a fucking hero. I'm sure some guy somewhere would be proud to date/marry a woman who put her life on the line for her brother.\n\nIdea of the day: if you marry and have your own kid, name him or her after your sister (obviously ask her / your spouse if they're on board with it). Your sister sounds like a champ. I'd say send her a bottle of wine but idk if you can drink after that sort of procedure.",
            "Speaking as a husband and father, the only person who failed here, it looks like to me anyways, is the ex-husband. Your sister had to make a terrible choice, and your ex brother in law should have supported her no matter what, because either way it was an unbearable thing for your sister to go through. He failed to really provide that support.\n\nHis failure here shows that when the rubber hit the road, he wasn't up to the job of 'husband'. This brought about a divorce which, given what we learned about the husband, may well have been coming anyway. \n\nSorry if I sound harsh, but if I am the husband here, I grieve, but I also make sure my wife is first and foremost supported.",
            "Look, you have life. Don't hate yourself because you're alive. If you hate yourself and throw it away then you piss away your sister's life and her sacrifice. What happened between her and her ex-husband are her actions and her marriage. That isn't on you. It isn't meant for you to bare. \n\nShe chose to give you a second chance at life. You know what you do with it? \n\nLIVE IT. ",
            "I'm sorry your sister was dealt those cards in life. There were two options\n\nAbort the baby and save your brother. Her husband resents her leading to divorce.\n\nLet you take your chances, most likely die. She resents her husband leading to divorce.\n\nThe husband wanted a miracle. You would live and the baby would live. That wasn't really in the cards. One of the above scenarios was. I'm sorry their marriage couldn't survive that. It's not your fault or her own. She may regret it because she may now believe you may have lived and the baby may have lived. That was a very slim chance. \n\nNot every couple is capable of surviving that type tragedy/loss.",
            "This sounds like it was just an overall shitty no win situation, so unless it was overwhelmingly in your control to not get sick in the first place, this is not your fault.",
            "There was no right or wrong choice. She chose the brother she already had and loved over the potential baby she didn't have yet. You should not burden yourself with a choice that she made, she is an adult. ",
            "At one point, my brother needed a liver transplant. He ended up needing a double heart and liver transplant from the same person, so I was made not an option v. quickly, but if I had been in your sister's situation I would not even have hesitated. I did end up losing my brother, and if I had felt ANYTHING prevented me from saving him, I would have resented them forever. \n\nYour sister knew what she was doing. Talk to her, respect her choice. She loves you.",
            "She can get a new husband. She can find happiness after a few years of depression. She can have another baby. But once your dead there's no fixing that",
            "OP, this is in no way your fault. Your BIL made a horrible decision. Your sister saved your life. And I guarantee you if I was in her place, I would have done the EXACT SAME THING to save the lives of any of my siblings. And I struggled to get pregnant. I would still have done it.\n\nThis is the damn definition of an extenuating circumstances. \n\nI definitely think you should speak to her. Tell her your mother spilled the beans. I'm sure she'll tell you she doesn't blame you, and you shouldn't blame yourself either. She saved your life, how could she be upset? \n\nPlease don't blame yourself. \n\nEdit: you know what. That man literally wanted her to let her baby brother die for a fetus. I wouldn't wanna be married to someone like that. ",
            "Your sister is a wonderful woman.  She not only saved your life, but she spared you the very painful details of how it happened.  She probably thought you would heal better without the guilt.\n\nI don't know what the right thing to do is, but if it were me, I'd go give my sister the longest, biggest hug ever.  Then I'd gently let her know that I know what she did, that I love her for it and that if and when she wants to talk about any of it, I will be there.  She might be relieved that she can finally share her pain with you.  Again, who knows what the right thing to say here is, but I wish you all well.  ",
            "Shit. I don't really have any advice for this really. I just wanted to give my condolences to a horrible situation. Absolutely nobody did anything wrong here. Not you. Not your sister. Not your mother. And not your ex brother-in-law. Just a group of victims faced with an impossible decision. I'm sorry, and I hope everything turns out okay.",
            "Your sister is incredible and deserves an incredible husband. I'm sorry, but her husband was not incredible. You should talk to her, but don't ask her to assuage any guilt you feel. Just tell her you understand the gravity of what she did for you and that you'll forever be grateful, and whenever she needs you, drop everything and be there for her.",
            "Your sister seems like a very mature, thoughtful person to have both done what she did and never tell you about it. She could have, after the divorce, told you out of sadness, anger, spite--but she didn't which says a lot about her. This gives good indication for how thoughtfully she would likely go about discussing the situation and your feelings with her. ",
            "Your sister saved your life. An existing person.\n\nHer husband wanted to risk your life for something that isnt a person that can always come about again.\n\nSorry, but sounds like the husband was a douche.\n\n",
            "First of all, her life is not \"destroyed.\" If her ex couldn't countenance her choice, he was not the right man for her! Plus, she will rebuild her life; it just won't look like the old one.\n\nSecond, opting an abortion plus a liver donation is a hellish choice. (As her husband, I too would have been very concerned.) However, it sounds like you have lost track of a key fact: it was HER choice, not YOURS. You are not responsible for her decision.\n\nWhich leads me to the last point: you dishonor her sacrifice if you do not embrace and make the most of your second chance at life. That includes being happy, dude. Yes, her life took an unfortunate turn of events, but I posit that your transplant was merely a catalyst and not a cause. I believe they would have eventually divorced; this life event merely hurried the process along.",
            "Whatever she did was her choice and it is in no way your fault. I can't imagine how hard it is on you at the moment. Get to therapy and work on this together as a family.",
            "If she hadn't done it shed be even more sad and it would be impacting an innocent child also. The stress of that probably would have lead to divorce made even worse because a child involved. \n\nGo talk to someone and suggest your sister do the same. ",
            "Your sister is a damn Hero.  She made a hard choice for what she believed was right.",
            "now that's pure love",
            "By grateful to your sister and don't squander the  second life she sacrificed so much to give you with self pity and hate. It's about you but it also not about you.  The marriage was doomed because your sister couldn't live with herself or her husband if she let you die. Go talk to your sister,  tell her you know,  tell her you are grateful,  tell her she's an amazing person and help her get back on her feet. ",
            "I just wanted to say. I have a sister I love to death. Between saving her life and keeping what is not even a child yet I'd pick my sister any time. See things are hard to explain and hard to understand. You two need consuling together and individually ",
            "If I was a match for my husband's brother, I would terminate our 2 month pregnancy to donate my liver to save his brother. It's an awful position for her to have been in, but really it was between her and her husband. They weren't compatible because they had different views and valued/prioritised different things. \n\nI know it was a tough spot for the husband to be in as well, but to have so little understanding and to offer so little support to his wife over something like this - I mean, the pregnancy was very early and could have miscarried anyway, they could make a new baby, and time was running out to save you, a person they could never replace. \n\nI expect your sister is feeling sad because she found out that her husband wasn't who she thought he was. And now that you're okay and things are back to normal it's probably difficult for her to remember exactly how it felt to be on the brink of losing you.\n\nI don't think you should tell her you feel bad, or that you wish she had let you die or anything, because what's done is done and that will only make her feel worse! Tell her you are so unbelievably grateful for this gift she gave you, that you are enjoying life and appreciating every day that you have to experience now, thanks to her and her sacrifice. Make her feel good about this, let her vent about what happened with her husband and help her to see that she made the right decision and should not have any regrets. She will find another man, she will go on to have a family of her own, and her kids will have an uncle! \n\nShe made there might choice, she couldn't have done anything else because that's clearly the kind of person she is. And if her husband couldn't see that and be proud of her and appreciate that about her then it's completely his loss.",
            "Your sister is an angel who loves you and honestly think about it if you loved someone as much would you have not done the same? No one decision can permanently ruin a person's life (except for suicide or obvious things like that). Your sister saved yours and you should definitely talk to her and provide as much support as possible. If her husband walked out knowing what she did for you and the amount of mental anguish and stress she must have been under in making that decision well then he's probably not the right person for her. At any rate, do not feel guilt, see this as an opportunity to enjoy life and connect with your sister on a deeper level and make her happy because she's genuinely a wonderful human being.",
            "I know I want kids and that my window of opportunity is getting smaller, but I would abort a million babies to save my brother.",
            "Your sister chose to make that sacrifice to save your life. I know it may be hard but I think it would make your sister very happy for you to be happy and successful and too use this second chance at life to the fullest. She made her decision and is living with it. Time will heal her wounds. Don't make her regret her choice by feeling guilty or anything negative. But definitely talk to her it may be the best thing you can do for each other. ",
            "Her ex didn't care as much about you as your sister does because he was only in love with his life. He wasn't thinking about the little sister she had known her whole life and what it would mean to lose her. At 2 months pregnant it is not as significant of a loss, sorry it's just not, but losing your little sister would be. The decision for her was clear, it's just too bad her ex couldn't see it that way. All I can say is that you just need to be a kickass sister to her for as long as you can. Maybe help her pick up the pieces, it's not like her ex was a selfless kind of guy anyway. Things will change.\n\nI mean no offense to anyone who has lost a baby at two months gestation but I think most would agree the loss of someone you have loved your whole life would be worse. ",
            "Your sister did a selfless and amazing thing and while you both shouldn't feel bad, I understand the feelings behind it. I agree with other comments about a counselor and telling your sister you know. ",
            "I wouldn't be apologetic either.  I completely understand your sister's position there and I would have made the same choice in a heartbeat to save one of my siblings.  I also would not want to stay with someone who blamed me for making that choice to save my sibling's life.\n\nYou and she have years of shared history... compared to a 2 month fetus?  I can understand feeling hurt and disappointed at losing that potential child but nothing, except his misplaced blame, was preventing them from conceiving again.\n\nTalk to your sister and let her know that you know.

What happened between your sister and her ex is also not your fault as whatever happened their relationship in dealing with the dilemma was between them. \n\nTalk to your mom about it first, tell her how you feel and that you want to talk to your sister.

She saved your life - you shouldn't feel bad about that.\n\nEven if that meant that her husband didn't agree, or that she'd have to abort her baby, or that her marriage would break down. If you looked at it from her perspective, it was either losing you, or losing her marriage. Whether you should ask her about this is up to you, but maybe it's time for you to come clean for both of your sakes. This must be as much of a burden for her as it is for you. She loves you. Don't feel guilt over that.\n\n",

Express your feelings but make sure to let her express hers, especially if she is going through a hard time. I honestly think there had to of been more to their marriage issues then the abortion. Does your sister have fertility issues? They could always try and make another child, while your life wasn't guaranteed if she didn't do the transplant. Be thankful you have an amazing sister who did that for you and don't ever blame yourself for her divorce. There had to be underlying trust issues or something else you didn't know about. Talk to your sister. Stay strong and remember to be thankful for the life you have and don't ever blame yourself. She saved you for a reason. That was her choice. ",
            "It's not your fault. You sister was is a difficult spot. What she did for you was a great gift and I am happy for your sake that she did. As far as her marriage, what she did felt  unfair to her husband. To terminate a wanted pregnancy without his consent. \n\nI am trying to put myself in his and her shoes. People have very differing opinions of what \"life\" is and when it starts. For those who view it as a bundle of cells like she probably did, it's a no brainier, giving her brother a chance was the right decision. On the other hand if he already thought of it as \"his baby\", then it had to be very painful for him to see her terminate. I don't think BIL was a bad guy if you consider than in his eyes he was trying to protect his unborn child. I think either way the marriage was in trouble because one of them would have had resentment. \n\nThe important thing is that this is not your fault. You didn't ask to be sick or for anyone to make sacrifices. Talk to your sister be supportive and kind. Don't beat yourself over it.\n\nEdit: downvotes for trying to see both sides of the situation?\n",
            "From a moral standpoint she did the right thing. The \"baby\" was only an inch long. Before three months if the period of greatest danger for a miscarry, moreso with this stress level. It didn't have a brain or feelings. If they had wanted to try again it'd only be a matter of time. Sacrificing you for a tiny 10% of a baby is ridiculous.\n\nIf she was the one who was sick and it was \"Treatment or pregnancy\" her doctors would strongly encourage her to abort and seek treatment, even if it would also make her infertile (Which it doesn't sound like she is).\n\nIt's not your fault you were sick and it's not her fault she did the right thing. In her place I do it every day of the week and twice on Sundays.\n\nTalk to her and seek therapy together.\n\n>My brother in law was a very decent guy. \n\nHe put his dumb inch long fetus ahead of your life.

Her husband doesn't sound like such a great guy if he was happy to stand idly by while you were dying.\n\nYou got some very good advice from the other people here, which I hope you'll follow. Just do your best to be there for her and help her get through this rough patch in her life.",
            "Fun fact: It makes more sense biologically to save your adult sibling than your unborn offspring. You share the same amount of genes with both of them but the unborn child is gonna have a lot of opportunities to die before procreating and spreading your genes further. It's like a textbook example actually. I'm a biologist.\n\nanyway: super awful situation and I think their relationship was doomed the second he asked her to leave you to die.",

            "I am really surprised that your transplant team green lit your sisters decision to abort a child in order to give you part of her liver. Organ donors go through rigorous psychological tests and assessments to determine if they can handle the act of giving part of their body to another person, because it is a massive toll on the donor both physically and mentally. I'm just really, really surprised that this was allowed. Giving up an organ is taxing enough, never mind also giving up a child in order to do so.\n\nHaving said that, it appears that she was cleared by your transplant team which means they believed she could handle it both physically and mentally. This decision was not made lightly by any means. I would hope that the transplant team factored your sisters husband into this scenario and provided them with access or resources for counseling. Whether or not they sought counseling or he made up his mind to divorce her as soon as she decided to abort is unclear. \n\nYou should definitely seek counseling through your transplant team. In addition, consider broaching the subject with your sister. A discussion needs to happen to relieve the tension from this secret she's been keeping and the guilt that you are experiencing. She gave you a second chance at life and you need to live it to its fullest capacity, and that includes maximizing your relationship with her and your family. No more secrets. Love her endlessly for the time back that she gave you and the enormous sacrifice that she made. She loves you that much, as illustrated by her actions. Reciprocating it and being the best brother you can be is the least you can do, and you seem smart enough and kind enough to know how to do that for her.\n\nGood luck, OP.  ",

He did an evil and selfish thing there by putting your sister in a situation that was impossible to win. Either she did what she felt was right and lost him,  or she obeyed him and lost you.  As soon as he made that threat (and that's what it was) your sister was never going to go back to being happy.\n\nSure.

There is a price to pay when making such decisions,  no matter the choice. If she had chosen differently and you passed away, her marriage would not have survived either,  since now just looking at husband would be a reminder of your passing.

Her husband was incredibly selfish about it. Yes, the pregnancy was wanted and the surgery was risky. But if my wife had to make that same choice I would absolutely back up that decision, as would she if I was in a similar situation. \n\nIf your sister made a mistake here, it was by not giving you full disclosure at the time, but that a tricky one, too. Knowing she would be terminating a wanted pregnancy which would most likely end her marriage, well, let's just say that many of us would have a hard time asking someone to make that sacrifice. She most likely knew you would refuse and that was unacceptable to her. This was her brother's life, and she could directly affect this outcome. \n\nI think you need to talk to her. There is no way for you to unknow this. Don't throw your mom under the bus.  She made a slip and you found out. Do not blame yourself; the choice in this matter was taken from you without your knowledge.  The best thing you can do is try to move forward with your sister and mother and see what can be done to make the best of a messed up situation.

Also that comment your mother made of your sister not being sure if it she made the right choice pissed me off a little bit, how can saving your life not be the right choice? I know that it cost her her marriage but her husband was being unreasonable, I know that she is in her rights to feel upset and depressed and everything but your mother didn't need to burden you with it. \nI wish you all the best, and please don't feel guilty for surviving, your sister wanted you to and made the decision by her self.

About 98% of you were super wonderful on my last post and seemed genuinely invested so I thought I'd give you all an update. \n\nIt's been just under a week now and after trying some of the different tactics and talking points you suggested, in addition to reaching out to the deaf/HOH community, my parents and I have come to a compromise, if only to shut me up. But I'm not the one that's important here, that would be Ana (6f).\n\nSo, come the new school year Ana will be going to the school my parents chose BUT we (including me!) will be keeping in close contact with her teachers, specialists, etc, her progress and talking to Ana herself about how she feels. If it seems like it isn't a great fit, we will be transferring her to the deaf school. It's a little out of the area, but I think we can make it work. \n\nI did open up to my parents a bit - as much as they could handle - and told them that I feel like I've been, not robbed but had a stunted childhood and that my academic abilities forced me to grow up quickly. That, coupled with their emotional distance and lack of physical presence with Ana, made me angry and frustrated that my opinions on her future weren't being taken into account.\n\nI wish I could say that was what did it, but honestly my points about the school not teaching Ana independence and other arguments brought up on the original post probably eased them over to my side a bit (I kept my temper even this time).\n\nI mentioned in my edit on the last post that I'd gotten in contact with a Deaf Advocacy group and they've provided some wonderful resources so hopefully sometime soon Ana will FINALLY be able to meet kids and adults like her! (She's SUPER excited by this. She's the least reserved and most outgoing sibling out of us three so I've no doubt she'll make friends quickly.)\n\nI've also made the decision to start seeing a therapist to maybe work on some of the issues that I've been reflecting on and to get some emotional support where my mom and dad drop the ball. I don't see them changing or even admitting they need to change anytime soon. But that doesn't mean I have to stay complacent. \n\nThat's...more or less the main chunk of what I wanted to say. I notice the rules say we aren't allowed to upload images so I'll just describe the drawing Ana just gave me to pin up on my office wall (she's a brilliant little artist, I'm not even biased).\n\n*An ocean surface. A large boat approaches from the left hand side, full of garbage. A great blue whale stands, mid-breech, opposing, brandishing a gun in one flipper. A speech bubble from the whale reads* ***'NO!'*** *while the ambiguously-gendered humans on the Garbage Boat scream in terror, presumably ready to flee.* \n\n(Her kindergarten assignment was to come up with a way we can protect our oceans from pollution and personally, I think she's hit the nail on the head.)\n\nThank you so much to everyone for your thoughts and feedback!\n\n**TL;DR: my parents and I came to a compromise on my deaf sister's elementary school, I am working through my issues, Ana is getting to know her community and she drew an awesome picture today.**",

If you aren't hearing impaired or deaf, it's very hard to understand how casually you are excluded from things, with impatience or thoughts that you aren't very bright.  Putting your sister with a group of people with the same impairment is going to grow her confidence by leaps and bounds!  Kudos to you for being a wonderful big brother!!",
            "Hi! I might give you some insight on the Special Education world. My training is in working with the blind and before that linguistics/language development (important in HOH education). I also worked at a school similar to what Ana is going to. \n\nAll children in the USA are physically and educationally protected by the ADA laws. Families are permitted to challenge their school districts for free and equatable education. ALSO... look up the Expanded Core Curriculum for her diagnosis. These are like the Bill of Rights for kids with disabilities. Even if you are not in the US, ever country has an equivalent via the WHO. \n1) parents need space to grieve not having a \u201ctypical\u201d kid. Grief is displayed is many different ways. I\u2019ve seen parents who are helicopter parents, denial (to the point of physical neglect, denial emotionally and then passing it off as \u201cnot treating disabled child differently\u201d, depression, etc.\n2) the private school I worked at was for blind children but they were actually medically fragile with blindness. However, (good news) the more abled children still benefited from one-on-one care. One child I worked with was deaf-blind and had been bouncing around foster care. The teachers, staff and specialists all were in one building and could customize the education and learning for her. Like you\u2019re sisters, she had \u201cbehavior\u201d issues, but once she was given the support she needed that was relieved.\n\nI know that the private school staff will push to have her in a public school when Ana\u2019s ready. It\u2019s drill into our head to give all students \u201cequal educational opportunities\u201d. No special education teacher would ethically have Ana there if she would blossom elsewhere. \n\n3) private vs public special education does involve federal and state money. It is possible Ana\u2019s school district is pushing for the more localized school. It\u2019s probably cheaper (but doesn\u2019t mean less than). The deaf school might be residential  or private bussing services might be an added expense. Right now your sister qualifies for an interpreter in class. However! Professional ASL interpretators aren\u2019t grown on trees and there\u2019s always a shortage. Depending on Ana\u2019s school district, there may not be enough qualified staff to fulfill the school district\u2019s needs. When that happens, districts will try to centralize the students in one place.\n\nSpecial education needs vs special education professionals are a huge jigsaw puzzle. \n\n4) if you are in the USA, ADA protects student needs.",
            "That's so bizarre that they're choosing to send her to a school for kids with mental impairment and mobility issues when there's literally a deaf school they could send her to. \n\nHonestly this doesn't sound like much of a compromise, they're still just sending her to the school they want for zero rational reason and trying to placate you by saying \"well maybe if it's not good we'll pull her out sometime in the future.\"",
            "Speaking as former student who has graduated from Oregon School for the Deaf, and have been attending mainstream from pre-school up to 9th grade (10th-12th grade was at the deaf school), I can personal say that my social experiences were much different. \n\nDo keep in mind that most oftentimes, deaf institute does not offer same level of education as mainstream may offer. This is often caused by HUGE variety of students' backgrounds, with some being growing up having absolutely no communication accessibility, to those that has been neglectful with their education. However, my BEST experience was to being able to communicate with everybody in my own language that i can understand the most.\n\nMy mainstream had Deaf/HoH program which advocate for our accessibility of education, such as making arrangements to have interpreter, 1 on 1 sessions and such. While that is amazing on its own, it could hinder the social development as it would requires less time of being around with peers. I was severely bullied and harassed throughout my time in mainstream up to where i personally decided to want to transfer to my deaf institution- for the sake of better social experience. \n\nIf anything, while your sister is not going to be attending to the deaf institute, I would ENCOURAGE you to maintain your contact in the deaf/hard of hearing community. Reach out to people, and try have your daughter being introduced to the culture and language itself. \n\nYou are amazing SODC (Siblings of Deaf Child/ren), and i applause you for taking steps in making sure that your sister would have the accessibility for her education. She will NEED you to help her through, so PLEASE stick with her when you can!\n\nPM me if you need any more info on deaf institute or ways to reach out to the community, i may have some ideas depending on where you live.\n\nPS: MOST of the time, your town should have a Facebook group delicates to deaf community, such as Deaf Night Out, Deaf Night Chat, etc. Do check around on Facebook, I'm sure you'll find some groups!!\n\n_\\m/",

Getting more personalized help later was what worked best for me. Obviously very different situation, but I agree with your idea that just because an educational environment is supposed to help students with special needs it\u2019s not a catch all for all needs. Hearing and intellectual disabilities are very different, so while it\u2019s good to be accommodating to everyone, those accommodations may not fit your sister the best.

The school will very likely suggest a different school more suitable to her needs. They won\u2019t want to hold her back from her capabilities. Many deaf children were misplaced in institutions in the last century but special needs teacher will have covered this in their training and will be quick to spot the difference.\n\nYou\u2019ve been a fabulous sister and advocate for Anna.

            "I didn\u2019t see your first post, but you are most likely very spot on regarding the school. I want to recommend that you get VERY clear on what it means for the school to be a bad fit. I\u2019d create a clear list of observed behaviors or concerns. As a special education teacher and former director of curriculum for a special education school, these are things that I would include:\n\n1. Identify her reading level. I don\u2019t work in Deaf education, so I can\u2019t help you, but I imagine Deaf advocates could help identify assessments to get a clear baseline.\n\n2. Collect an informal writing sample that shows you letter formation, spelling, punctuation, grammar.\n\n3. See if the current teacher can give you a baseline for math (what she does and doesn\u2019t know).\n\n4. Get an idea of her expressive language- this may be tricky, but someone in the Deaf community could probably help. How well does she communicate her thoughts? What vocabulary does she know/use?\n\n5. Get clear on what behaviors seem normal for her. What is her baseline emotional state? How does she respond to frustration or distress?\n\nThe school should provide an intake assessment, but if they don\u2019t, see if the Deaf community can support.\nThen I would informally track these things weekly, especially her emotional world. She may enjoy the program because they don\u2019t challenge her academically. They most likely don\u2019t have high expectations and will tell you she\u2019s doing great, because compared to her peers she is.\n\nIf she starts showing any changes in self-esteem or distress tolerance and emotional regulation, and the school has no clear plan for how to support improving these behaviors, pull her. If they seem too relaxed about it, or only rely on punishment/consequences, I\u2019d pull her. For many kids, school can be traumatizing. It takes years to undo a year of shitty teaching/experiences in school.\n\nHaving worked at private special education schools most are absolutely not equipped to handle a high functioning, deaf child. Most likely, you are seeing deaf children with other disabilities that make being in a traditional school nearly impossible. What often happens in private special needs schools is that unless they are specifically for deaf students, they will lump her in with ALL deaf students, many of whom are severely impacted. This is often done because they don\u2019t have enough kids to form an appropriate peer group. \n\nThis was an issue my last school struggled with when a child was more impacted in 1 way, but then additionally gifted. We had 5 children that were the same age and much more impacted physically than our other students. However, cognitively they were ALL over the place. Because we didn\u2019t have the resources, we had to group them together to meet their physical needs and often ended up teaching them individually (which isn\u2019t financially sustainable) so that they didn\u2019t fall behind if they were cognitively gifted. I don\u2019t know many schools that will do this.\n\nSo great step AND get clear on what signs mean pull her. I wouldn\u2019t wait a semester to do it either as that\u2019s too long at that age. Kids grow exponentially during that time so a few months is like a year for older kids.",
            "You\u2019re a good bro, nice done",
            "You're a wonderful brother. As a teacher and parent the same age as your parents I was genuinely concerned by your first post. You identified your sister's needs so precisely and made it so clear that these needs would not be fully met with the original plan. Frankly your maturity and insight blew me away in that post, as did your courage and concern for your sister's needs in this. I don't mean in any way to be patronising, you should be so, so proud of yourself. You have wisdom and bravery beyond your years, and she is lucky to have you advocating for her.",
            "Are there other adults, grandparents, aunts, uncles you can enlist? I think there is a chance that a bigger fight may be coming your way.  Keep in touch with the Deaf community and put Ana in touch with it as soon as you can figure out the technology.  Also Ana's pediatrician.  Round them up, too.  Bless you.",

            "It's good you and your parents are agreeing and going to be monitoring the situation. What confused me from your first post was how your parents got her into this school when she's got no diagnosed \"issues\", and other than being deaf, she's a normal 6 year old little girl? \nBUT this could work in your favour. The school will assess Ana, and may go to your parents themselves and tell them this school is unsuitable to Ana's needs. They might, or might not, recommend another more suitable school. So, with you, your parents and the school monitoring this ongoing situation, I think Ana will be OK. Its hard to admit when you're wrong. People called them \"ableist\", but I think it's probably more likely ignorance. Having had to \"normal healthy\" children,  Ana being deaf was probably 1 hell of a shock. Not saying that's right or wrong, just calling it as I see it. Your parents maybe be emotionally distant, but I'm sure they love you all, in their own way, and to the best of they capabilities. Sometimes, sadly, that isn't enough. So you being Ana's advocate is highly commendable. Because that's what you are. You may get outside help/advice, but you're the 1 pushing for what's best for her. An \"adult\" probably couldn't do any better than you have.\nI just want you to know that while doing all this for Ana is amazing, you still need to focus on you. You are still a teenager after all, regardless of your prodigious talents. Help, but help yourself too.\nAnd, I know it probably won't mean much coming from a stranger, I'm very proud of you and your love and care for another human being. Especially considering you're at an age when kids can have the occasional selfish tenancies. You're giving your sister the love she needs, that she isn't getting from other sources, and it's truly a beautiful thing. Thank you.",

My dad worked as a computer engineer and retired at 54.  I am not a professional, but barring any other issues - any behavioral issues she may be having might be a result of just being deaf and not understanding her environment and not being able to communicate it well.

Your parents might be from an era where disabled children were put into a institution or think that way.

            "Hello, I'm popping in extremely late with anecdotes! But your situation really resonated with me personally.\n\nI have a deaf cousin who has been infantilized all her life for similar reasons as your sister. My cousin is (maybe?) a little slow. I don't know her IQ, but let's say it's 85 in a family full of 130's. She attended a school for the deaf, but it was one where deafness was basically equated with intellectual disability. When she became an adult, her parents wouldn't let her move out. When she fell pregnant, her parents wouldn't allow her to marry the father. Not because she would lose disability or insurance benefits (she would not have), but because they didn't think she had the capacity to live on her own. She was not allowed to have a job.\n\nThe reason I say that she's \"maybe\" a little slow is that, in my opinion, no one has any idea of her intellectual capacity because she was never challenged or expected to do much. My \"proof\" of this is that when she was in her 40s, after her kid grew up, she took control of her life. She got a retail job, and she moved in with her kid's dad. (He is also deaf and was an involved parent, despite not being able to marry her.) She learned how to cook (which she was not allowed to do because she burnt something when she was like 12), and how to generally take care of herself without having to be reminded of basic stuff. Her mom still does a lot for her, though, like taking care of all of her financials and driving her around (another thing she was not allowed to do).\n\nIn contrast, I went to school with a seriously intellectually challenged girl who is now a successful real estate agent. (Our families knew each other so I know for a fact she tested just above borderline in elementary school.) In my inexpert opinion, my cousin is much more capable than the girl I went to school with. The difference is, the parents of my schoolmate had realistically high expectations and they did a TON of work to help her become independent. She went from remedial 2nd grade to being mainstreamed by middle school. She was even in a gifted math class in 8th grade (She fell behind on the gifted track, but I think she got up to trig.) She graduated from college.\n\nAnyway, all that's to say, there's no reason your family should put an artificial cap on your sister's capacity. It's a huge disservice. It might take being *extremely* involved as a parent, and it might take her a little longer to learn things, but there's no reason she can't be given *a chance* to operate at her full capacity.",
            "I am hoping that the school will recognize your sister's needs and be more concerned that they are being met than with receiving any tuition your parents are paying. Hopefully, the school will inform your parents that your sister is not intellectually impaired just because she is deaf.",

I was still scared I might lose her friendship but if she was with someone else because I never said anything I would probably regret not saying much more. \n\n\n\nWe were watching another episode of game of thrones which we do weekly. \n\nI was planning on just telling her I like her after you guys advised against the \"love you\" but it also made it hard for me to articulate my feelings\n\n\nInstead I listed all the things she does that I think makes her unique and awesome. At some point I mumbled that even though she was extremely messy and disorganized she was capable of anything and everything. She looked a little worried  \"if you were my doc Id think you were about to deliver my death sentence why are you being nice, you never compliment anyone, are you feeling okay, dont freak me out\" she started touching my forehead for my temperature and since I was nervous as fuck I was a tomato probably over heating. You could probably cook an egg on my face. \n\n\n\nI suck so I ended up blurting out \"I think Im in love with you\". yeah I realized I F up and said \"no I mean like, like you\" \n\n\nShe went from worried to confused to humored. She stared at me for a while and this just made it worse as I could tell she was smiling but I wasn't sure if she was laughing at my stupidity or what. She teased me for a bit as to \"which is it, like or love ?\". I said I didn't want to scare her so she can pick which ever she liked. Yeah .... \n\n\nSo I started back tracking and said she could ignore everything and started apologizing for making her feel uncomfortable. Thats when she told me to shut up. I dont remember what I was saying but she later told me that I was talking 100k/h and she couldn't make sense of. \n\n\nBut she she said she likes me too!!!. We didn't kiss even though I really really wanted to but I couldnt get myself to do it. We cuddled instead and talked. \n\n\nWe've been hanging out every day since then doing pretty silly things. Last night we decided to spend the entire day/night in the city rather than go home. We laid on the grass and just talked/cuddled. \n\n\nI told her I was going to kiss her when it was 5 am. don't ask. So we talked till 5 and she reminded me it was 5. So we started this really awkward thing where I kept telling her I'm going to kiss you really really soon but couldn't go for it and kept repeating myself. But then she moved closer and well I went for it. it was just a peck but it was still awesome. She started giggling and I kissed her again. She continued giggling and I told her unless she stopped giggling that I wasn't going to stop kissing her and she laughed harder so I went for more than a peck. It was/is one of the most amazing feelings Ive ever felt. We kissed the entire morning. She said she couldnt control the laughter because she was nervous too, she laughs when shes nervous. So she wasn't laughing at me. \n\n\n\n So yeah, I think its safe to say Im not asexual.  Part of me felt sad that this was what I was missing out on all these years as nothing compares to it but the other part of me is really happy that it happened with Zara, shes truly amazing.\n\n\n OW one last thing! she said she loves me too after the kiss, although she was worried about saying it too early. \n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: I ended up blurting that I love her, she said she likes me back we kissed.

            "You don't have to label yourself, but if a label will help you answer questions about yourself, maybe look up the term *demisexual*? It's still part of the asexuality spectrum. We can't post external links here, so I'll just copy and paste the first search result (from the AVENwiki):\n\n> A demisexual is a person who does not experience sexual attraction unless they form a strong emotional connection with someone. It's more commonly seen in but by no means confined to romantic relationships. The term demisexual comes from the orientation being \"halfway between\" sexual and asexual. Nevertheless, this term does not mean that demisexuals have an incomplete or half-sexuality, nor does it mean that sexual attraction without emotional connection is required for a complete sexuality. In general, demisexuals are not sexually attracted to anyone of any gender; however, when a demisexual is emotionally connected to someone else (whether the feelings are romantic love or deep friendship), the demisexual experiences sexual attraction and desire, but only towards the specific partner or partners.\n\nMore importantly, CONGRATS! This is really awesome and I'm happy for you, dude. ",
            "My brotha, I too experienced this. I had mostly come out of my shell during high school, but my personal understanding of sexuality was lagging behind. I knew I liked women, but communicating with them anywhere beyond simple talk was a chore in itself. But I finally got my chance with someone who didn't care that I was odd. It didn't pan out in the end, but I got to experiences so damn much during our time together. Plus we are still good friends.",

What you think you were missing out on may not be anywhere near as good as what you are now experiencing simply because of the connection you have with her. \n\nI am similar, you could give me supermodel big tit fit body ready to fuck next to your average girl who I have a great connection to, I'll pick the 'average' girl, cos to my brain she is so much more attractive. I can't bring myself to take easy hookups from the club but just last night I met a girl I've been talking to for a couple weeks, way outside of my normal physical attraction criteria but we had a great night because we felt comfortable with each other.

        "selftext": "My friend came to me yesterday at lunch with screenshots of my boyfriend's tinder profile. The pictures were all old photos so I confronted him immediately expecting to hear something like \"Yeah, haha I forgot to delete that.\" which is cool. He denied being on tinder at all and my friend suggested that she make an account, set it to his specifications, and see if he turns up. and there's his profile.\n\nSo, this means that my boyfriend has been active on tinder within the past two weeks. I confronted him with this and he changed his story. Now he's saying that his friend has been using his account. He shows me his phone and says, \"Look, I have nothing to hide.\" and of course the app is deleted.\n\nSo I take his phone, download tinder, log in with his facebook and see that he has been active, albeit infrequently. There was one girl that he tried to meet up with back in May when I was out of town. The girl gave him her phone number and even though he deleted whatever messages they exchanged, I still saw that he had her saved in his contacts.\n\nSo that's about everything that I know. He either cheated on me or planned on cheating on me while I went out of town, and I'm sure this isn't the only time it's happened. This relationship is pretty much over.\n\nHe is swearing up and down that it's not true. He doesn't use tinder and he doesn't know this girl. I'm going crazy with how much he's outright lying. He seems so sincere, but I KNOW what I saw. I can't listen to him deny this one more time.\n\nI know that this is the end, I guess I'm looking for advice on how to end it in a way that doesn't leave me second guessing myself. and moral support.\n\nTL;DR: Caught my boyfriend on tinder trying to meet up with girls while I was out of town. He's denying it so vehemently that I almost believe him. What do I do?\n\nEdit: This blew up while I was away!I'm sorry I won't be able to respond to every comment.\n\nSo I did some stuff that was kind of petty and stupid today: I made a fake tinder account, matched with my boyfriend, and he starts messaging me and immediately asks me to meet him for a drink. We agree to meet by a fountain in the center of my town and I pack up all of his stuff in a tote bag, put on a great outfit and went to the fountain.\n\nI stood kind of out of the way of the fountain in the shadows where I could watch the street that I knew he'd be arriving from. I was devastated, but I figured this way I could catch him without a doubt and end things quickly. All the time, he's messaging this girl on tinder.\n\nBut he didn't show up. Two of his roommates did. We didn't speak (I don't know them well), but they watched me for a while, figured out what was going on after a few more tinder messages, and left quickly.\n\nSo I wait a few minutes and I call my boyfriend and ask him where he's at. He says he's just gotten off of work and he's going to meet his roommate for a drink. I confront him with the fake tinder profile and he's dumbstruck and furious with his roommate, who he swears up and down is behind all of this.\n\nI'm at home now, just emotionally exhausted and confused. Whatever is going on with his roommates is super sketchy and creepy.\n\nadvice please?\n\nEdit part two:\n\nThank you all so much for your advice and support!\n\nA few things that I think are important\n\n* Up until this point my boyfriend and I had a great relationship. Really, no red flags anywhere. If I had already been suspicious that he was cheating this would be a much easier break for me\n* The most recent message on his tinder account when I checked it yesterday was sent to a girl he had matched with before we met. It said \"Would you want to meet up with my friend?\"\n* My boyfriend is the kind of person who's iphone passcode is 0000. I wouldn't be surprised if his roommates did know all of his passwords. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, his tinder account is still matched with my fake profile. To me, that indicates that he probably isn't the person operating the tinder profile. If it were him, wouldn't he have blocked the fake profile immediately?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA lot of people have said that he probably sent his roommates to check things out for him. I can't write that off entirely but my gut says that it isn't true. I just don't think it's very likely. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes to his roommates, I'm very concerned that they have been using his profile to trick women into meeting with them. The fact that his profile hasn't been deleted makes me worry that my boyfriend is in on this. So that's about where I'm at right now. I'm worried that all of them are working together to at best, scam women, at worst, assault them and my boyfriend is at least passively involved. Either way, I feel some responsibility to do a little more digging. ",

You don't need his approval or permission.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> and moral support. \n\nThis sucks. There's nothing to be said that will make it suck less. It's not okay what he did, but it's okay however you feel about it. Feeling anger, denial, confusion, desperation, sadness, everything at once or even nothing is all okay. Even missing him or the good times sometimes is okay, because you got used to him and now you have to get used to not being with him. Not missing him or wanting to rip him apart is okay too. You feel whatever you feel. It may be unpleasant, but feelings aren't wrong. Certain actions can be wrong, though. (For example, as long as you're not planning on actually doing it, feeling like hurting him is okay.) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake good care of yourself. Eat, shower, get dressed, rest, and exercise. You need to process a break up and how things ended. That takes time and take that time. Limit or avoid contact with him for now as that will reopen wounds before you're properly healed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt may not be much, but downloading the deleted app and logging with his FB account was pretty smart. You can take care of yourself. It won't make this suck any less, but you can take care of yourself.",

            "So I have an insane story.\n\nI was dating a women who on the surface had it all, and down below had some real strange habits and an adderall addiction.\n\nSo, early on in dating her, I was falling asleep with my arms above my head.  All of a sudden what felt like tickling in my arm pit facing her shocked me awake.  Like, really disturbing \"wtf\" sensation that just threw me out of sleep.  I asked what the heck happened, she said she was just reaching over to touch me and accidentally got my arm pit.  I told okay, but that was really, really disturbing and to please try not to so accurately get my arm pit when reaching over.\n\nThat was the first time\n\nIt would continue to happen probably about every 6-8 weeks.  I would be falling asleep/just fallen asleep and her hand would hit my arm pit...and it would be SHOCKING.  Like I couldn't understand how i was either a) this sensitive to b) was she really just reaching over?\n\nMind you, too, I have shared a bed with several dozen other people and NEVER have any of those other ones ever mistaken my arm pit for where they were reaching for.\n\nBut every time it was the same excuse \"I was just reaching over because I wanted to cuddle/be with you/touch you\".\n\nAnd I was beginning to lose my patience for it too.  The first 3 or so times I put it on me.  The next 3 or so times I was more approaching the \"could you fucking not\" point.  The last 3 or so times (yes, it did go on that long) it was \"I can't believe you're still doing this!\".\n\n...and the other funny thing about this, too, was she would claim it was an accident, but she was never apologetic about it.  It was \"I was just trying to touch you...\" but any more discussion she would act like it was my fault for reacting the way I did and even talk down to me about it.  \n\nI know if i got someone in the armpit while they were trying to fall asleep I would feel shitty and think I was an idiot, and be absolutely apologetic (not to mention not do it again).  This was not her.\n\nThe last time it happened was the clincher.  I was exhausted, had just come back from a long trip that day only to hang out with her and her niece that evening and come to bed wiped.  I was at that weird tired point where the minute i lied down my body just sank into the bed without me, but my mind was still some what awake and running.  I must have looked and seemed completely asleep but I was still fully aware of my surroundings.  That's when I started to feel it:  Her hand was slowly creeping towards me on the bed.  I felt it gently, barely, touch my elbow once, then pull up right to my arm pit AND GO FULLY IN WITH TICKLE FINGERS.  Like fingers blazing right after lining her hand up and testing to see if I was reactive.  I was INSTANTLY shocked awake (like all the other times) but in this moment I was also waking up to the fact that she was, and had been doing this on purpose the entire time, for whatever reason.\n\nWhat happened next though relates to you.  \n\nI said \"What the hell was that?!\" she then said \"I just rolled over to touch you!  Why are you acting so mean?! (which was a complete lie)\"  I then told her that that seems like a complete lie and I was awake for this time and I felt it all...to which she replied to me how mean i was being and how she just wanted to touch me and can't believe how rude I would be to my girlfriend(her) and treat her like this and do something like this to someone they love and blah blah blah....Her response was easily twice the response I had and was nothing but shaming me without ever actually apologizing or siting what just happened....\n\n...pretty much trying to shame/lie me back into the narrative.  Back into their narrative.  Because reality doesn't matter if they can get you to fold.  I never called her a name, never brought up anything more than what I had just experienced and the entire time I was just hearing back how-could-I-be-doing-these-things to her (asserting reality).  You need to be in reality.  You need to trust reality.  You need to trust yourself even when it does all seem crazy because the crazy don't care.  Not about reality and not about you.",

There was one girl that he tried to meet up with back in May when I was out of town. The girl gave him her phone number and even though he deleted whatever messages they exchanged, I still saw that he had her saved in his contacts.\n\nThis is more than enough to break things off.\n\n> He doesn't use tinder and he doesn't know this girl. I'm going crazy with how much he's outright lying.\n\nThat's the point. He hopes he can deny so hard that you will eventually just give in.\n\n> I know that this is the end, I guess I'm looking for advice on how to end it in a way that doesn't leave me second guessing myself. and moral support.\n\nIf you're not living together, this is fairly easy. Feel free to text,  call, or meet up with him in person at a public location (but not a restaurant, possible like a park) with witnesses (who aren't necessarily within ear shot though) during daylight. Tell him it's over, that you're not buying his bullshit, and that it's over. Then walk away. If he tries to text, call, or contact you again, block him. Don't respond.\n\nYou *might* consider telling him that \"this can't work\" if he won't be honest, leaning on that super hard to see if he will spill the beans. I imagine he will trickle-truth you. \"I was just flirting. I was never going to do anything with her.\" \"I just saved the phone number to text her when you are away and I'm feeling lonely.\" Etc.\n\n> What do I do?\n\nDump him.\n\nIf you live with him, then you need to find a way to get out safely. If your landlord can work with you to get you off the lease with minimal financial damage to yourself, try to arrange for that.",

This is usually done through transparency.\n\nIf there isn't any transparency, and he won't work to rebuild your trust, do you think you will be able to trust him again? If not, do you think you should be in a relationship with someone you can't trust?\n\nI spent years with someone who I didn't trust. I never trusted her again after she had cheated.

If not, he may be telling the truth.\n\nHe can delete the thread on his phone, but not the messages from his cell phone bill.\n\nEither way, he's got some explaining to do. Why would his roommates not just use their own account? They could be complete assholes, but then why would they actually show up? Is your (ex?) boyfriend a lot better looking than them? ",

It doesn't matter that he didn't meet up with anyone. The fact of the matter is that he is putting himself out there as if he is available. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis basic scenario is what happened to me. I had dated the guy for 2 years, only to find out he was active online. A friend of mine found him, messaged him and he agreed to meet the fake girl she had created! So I met up with him instead. And he STILL lied about it. \n\nIf he's unhappy in the relationship, it's simple, leave. If he wants to see what other options he has, then he can be single and do that. But he can't have BOTH!\n\nThis is the biggest issue I have found with modern dating. I know it's not just guys, I have heard of women doing this as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt just seems like people are never satisfied with what they have in front of them and are always prowling around for the next 'better' option.\n\nSeek out moral support from friends and family. Forget about this guy. He didn't care about your relationship as he was actively looking for other people while you were away.

I didnt want to end the relationship because his whole family loved me and I wanted to see the good in him. Literally the next day or maybe two days later I saw more tinder notifications on his phone and I found him with another girl at his house. My point is, don't wait until you actually see him with another girl. I thought it would make it easier on me to really know for sure that he was lying, but I ended up just wishing I trusted myself sooner and felt I like an idiot for waiting.

I was devastated, but I figured this way I could catch him without a doubt and end things quickly. All the time, he's messaging this girl on tinder.  \n>  \n>But he didn't show up. Two of his roommates did.

That his information from Facebook was hacked and instead of doing anything worthwhile they made a tinder account and then somehow hacked his phone to make a contact? Is your BF enemies with Russia?\n\nFine lets say his Facebook PW was found out by someone he knew. That person then made a Tinder profile to sabotage your relationship....? How would that person then get access to his phone to make a contact? Did they hang with your BF until finally he left his phone unguarded? Then they were like \"Finally, the last step in the most ridiculous plot to get you guys to breakup! Quickly, make a contact in his phone before he is back!\"\n\nHe is cheating on you. There is no other possible explanation. No one relevant in your life has the resources to do something like this and those who do have absolutely nothing to gain from it.

And if by chance he was ok with his buddy using his profile to catfish other women...that's a break up worthy offense as well because A) its fucking shitty and B) he's allowing his image to be portrayed as single....meaning he is ok with other women thinking he's single, regardless of who is behind the phone.\n\nDump him. \n\nCheaters never change.  \n\n\nThat being said...just a bit of advice.  In your next relationship, don't bring any baggage from this asshat with you.  Its not fair to punish your next boyfriend for the transgressions of this guy.  \n\nBut be up front right from the beginning.  You are deactivating and deleting any and all dating apps and you expect him to do the same. And if you ever see or hear of him on dating apps, you'll dump him in a heart beat.\n\nThat way he knows right from the beginning that if you even catch a sniff of him being a scumbag, you'll bail.\n\n\n\n",
            "OP, if you don\u2019t break up with him now, you\u2019re teaching him it\u2019s ok to lie and cheat on you and he will do it again. Leave this waste of skin ",
            "I used to work on a well-known relationship show, and dating apps/social media were the absolute #1 issue that came up time and time again. There is never, ever, ever a good excuse for a person to have a Tinder profile if they are not actively using it. Period. It's never that they made it for a friend. That is such grade-A b.s. and THEY ALL SAY IT. \n\nYou are 23. Your stock is UP. There is absolutely no reason to put up with even the shadow of a doubt about who you are dating, because seriously, you can go out right now and find someone better. Even if you don't want to date right away, you've got nothing holding you back from having a great f-ing life with none of this drama. DO NOT BELIEVE HIM. Dump, dump, dump.",
            "I was in a very similar situation and let my boyfriend talk his way out of it. I was naive, trusting, in love, and he seemed so genuine. It was all bullshit. He, like your BF, is a skilled liar. Breakup with him now. I would give anything to go back in time and end things there. Instead we got married and he cheated on me the whole time and had an Ashley Madison account. I found out when I caught him with the last one, though I think he wanted to get caught then. Wasted years of my life. Don\u2019t do the same. No guy is worth it.",
            "You know he was on Tinder, got a girls number, saved it, etc. You KNOW all of this... Yet he has continued to lie to you...thats insane.  I don't understand why you're asking for advice instead of just breaking up with him.  ",
            "You found this girls contact number in his phone??? There is no denying that. He was the one talking with her. Just walk away. ",
            "People like this will lie and lie and lie no matter what. Even if he comes clean, he\u2019ll still be lying about something. Even if the house is on fire right in front of them they will tell you it is not and that you are crazy and imagining things. You saw the phone number in his phone, you saw his tinder profile with recent activity, you know he\u2019s lying to you. Run! Run far. I can guarantee it\u2019ll get way worse than tinder girls and lies if you stay. ",
            "Why would you live like that? It\u2019s your choice.\nMove on or stay with a jerk. Simple. Don\u2019t make it more than it is. ",
            "You know that song \"It wasn't me\" by Shaggy? Pretty sure that should be your ex's ring tone for whenever he tries to call you. \n\nNo one is sometimes more sincere than the liar caught. Come on, people have caught their significant others in bed and still had the cheater tell them \"this isn't what it looks like.\" There's a reason that's a clich\u00e9. People understand that if they refuse to bend or break and act \"sincere\" it will make a normal person begin to doubt their perception aka \"Who you gonna believe? Me or your lying eyes!\" \n\nDon't take the guy back. His changing stories alone tell the entire story. Stop talking to him and block him. It's done. Also understand you may not want it to be true, but that doesn't make it not true. ",
            "My ex also did something similar, swore up and down that he was not cheating when I had so much evidence saying otherwise. I ended things with him, not just because of the cheating but because I hated feeling crazy for trying to prove that I was right when he would just deny it. I hated feeling like that, I hated being that kind of paranoid person. Any trust was gone and I knew I needed to be done with him for myself and my sanity. ",
            "Break up with him. Simple as that. Men who lie about things as simple as this will lie about anything. Found this out the hard way, recently. Now I\u2019m single and happy. ",
            "He\u2019s a cheater and it doesn\u2019t sound like he has any intention of stopping, just stringing you along for convenience and lying to you all the while. I\u2019ve definitely been here, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to go through this. Feel free to PM me :) ",
            "I caught my ex all but red handed with my best friend and he denied it to the very end even when the 'friend' admitted to it.  Some people will lie even when they have been caught.  Don't trust him, trust yourself and your gut.",
            "You already said that the relationship is over. Cut your losses and move on. ",
            "Ugh, OP, I\u2019m so sorry. I had a very similar experience with an ex-boyfriend. Swore up and down I was on the wrong even though I had all the evidence in front of him. I remember one ridiculous phrase: \u201cWho are you going to believe? The browser history or me?\u201d So, you know, it was all my fault for not adjusting reality to his lies.\n\n\nYou will not get a rational explanation. You will not get closure, and in the off-chance you do, it will not be enough. Because you did everything right and you still got a shit deal. Sometimes that happens and the good thing is - you still have yourself. And who does he have? Himself. In the long run, you\u2019ll realize that you got the better end of the deal. \n\nAnd most importantly, you will love again, and you will be loved back. Humans are good at love. Sending you lots of hugs, OP. It goes without saying, but you deserve better. ",

            "Please leave him. That's some psycho shit he's doing. Are his roommates really so ugly that they can't use their own Tinder accounts or they're sabotaging their roommate? I don't believe it at all. Just leave asap. ",

It said \"Would you want to meet up with my friend?\"\n\nHas it not occurred to you that he's actively trying to cover his tracks??? \n\nHe tried meeting a girl while you were out of town. \n\nThere is NO REASON for his friends to use his Tinder profile, or for him to find them girls to date. \n\nAt first I thought *they* were making you look like a fool.... now I think you just want to be duped. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

            "Just posting to tell you that trying to find out the \"truth\" will do nothing for you. Closure isn't a thing in relationships, especially when it comes to cheating. If they aren't telling you the truth now, what they say when you end it isn't necessarily going to be the truth, either. And, sometimes, more information just breeds more questions.\n\nYou've seen enough to know he's being dishonest and a philanderer. After the last conversation you had, you don't even owe him the time or energy to tell him you're breaking up. Tell him his stuff will be on the porch/outside your door/wherever, block him, and move on.\n\nYou're not crazy. He's just an asshole. ",

What you do is ask yourself \"AbleAlgae, is there anything possible that would make me ever trust this guy again short of the appearance of God in the Heavens  with a message of 'yeah, I used his phone, my bad!'?\" And if you don't see any shot of ever having faith in his veracity again, then you do nothing. You do not answer phone calls or the door. You don't reply to texts. You don't acknowledge him on social media. \n\nWhat you do is move on.

I've seen guys lie like that, sounding so sincere and truthful, but then I found out exactly how full of shit they were. You're better off without him, don't give him the benefit of the doubt, just ghost his ass. Drop his stuff off wherever and get your stuff back from him.

If you make yourself open for discussion, he will continue gaslighting you as though you are an idiot. You know what you need to know. He knows you know.

Be strong, you\u2019ve got this. Also, I\u2019m sorry :( what an asshole!\nAt least it was only a year...get out there and have fun! In 6 months you won\u2019t even be thinking about this POS. ",
            "Aww pal. I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but it sounds like he's at it. \nIt's so easy to compromise yourself and your standards at times like this to avoid the break up (whick I know obviously will be awful for you after you've put in a year of your time and emotional investment) \n\nBut the reality is being sad for a few weeks is well better than sticking around some bell end who sneaks about behind your back trying to get himself some action. You need to put yourself first in this situation even if it's harder in the short term. \n\nI think the fact that he's lying about it is the most pathetic thing about this. You've gave him the opportunity to be honestly and he's lied like a slimey wee toad. That's not someone worth your love and respect!\n\nI'd get him patched, get myself a shiny new tinder! \n \nPs, I'm 31 and I really wish I'd valued myself more in my 20's, my biggest regrets include the times I've let guys away with shit to save a relationship. \n\nI hope you're alright \ud83d\ude18\n\n",

            "Anyone who doesn't feel sorry with being truthful isn't someone worth convincing yourself to forgive them. Even if he was not lying, he should be on his hands and knees begging for forgiveness for making you feel like he cheated.",
            "you're not crazy! this same situation happened to me, and it wasn't worth it after I knew what kind of person he truly was. I was lucky enough to only waste a few months of my life trying to forgive him, but those were still months that were prolonging the pain of finding out that he's a cheater and liar. you know who he is now, and it's time to leave, despite how hard I know it is. you can always PM me if necessary. so many people have been in your shoes and are here to validate your experiences.",
            "So not only did he cheat on you, he's now gaslighting. How condescending is it that he thought you'd believe his crappy excuse as well? You'll miss his at first but soon you'll be look back and be so relieved you ended it sooner rather than later.

I have been in the same situation, found my boyfriend on Tinder and he swore up and down that he\u2019s friends were messing around on it. I know his friends and they know me so I thought that was odd but I accepted it. Then it happened again. We broke up. Then we started trying things out again and I snooped one night (not proud of it. I was drunk and paranoid but no excuse) and I had found that he was talking to a girl when we had gone to the city for the day. He continued to swear up and down that nothing was serious, blah blah blah. Don\u2019t subject yourself to this. It sucks. ",

It sounds like you're able to see the truth through the gaslighting, his excuses are so ridiculous. You are absolutely doing the right thing by choosing to end the relationship. I would tell him that you can see through his lies, know what's going on, and that \"if he wants to pursue other options, now he can do so openly... because this option is now off the table for good.\" And then block him.

She might say now she loves it, even though it has flaws. In a few months when it\u2019s just another part of her body, casually mention that you wish it had cleaner lines or more solid color, and see how she reacts.

You\u2019re right, it is a bit awful. If you really look at it, though, you can see how easily it could be fixed up!

This could be a life long decision and she went off half cocked. Im not saying put her down but expecially If you plan on staying with her a while she needs to be able to think life altering things through thoroughly enough. Finding a tattoo artist who can do a rose isn't hard you should really drive home that point. Obviously I know my idea is more harsh but I've had similar problems in the past with my gf and this approach really helped her think things out more\nHope for the best\n",

It's amazing how much we get used to things. Even a beautiful tattoo might look a bit out of place before you get used to it, and even a shitty tattoo might become endearing. So before it's healed enough to think about covering it up with a new tattoo, you can just ensure her that you'll get used to it like a new haircut.

            "This happened to me.... I got the tattoo and it wasn\u2019t exactly what I wanted, and I also regretted the placement and became somewhat depressed about it because I felt like I \u201cruined my body.\u201d\n\nI also didn\u2019t learn my lesson after 18-year-old me got a tattoo from the cheapest place she could find to defy her mother. The first tattoo also looks nothing like the picture and was so faded from the start because he did such a shitty job that I never deliberately showed it to anyone.\n\nThe bottom line is... the 18-year-old me tattoo tells a story about the little asshole I was as a teenager. It\u2019s part of my life. A story. A memory. And while it\u2019s still ugly as can be, and kind of funny actually. It\u2019ll probably be a teaching moment i share with my kids someday. I actually like it now for those reasons.\n\nThe second one I just got, I know that I got for a reason and that reason will never change. It will be an image that defines this moment in my life and it\u2019s not nearly as ugly as I thought in the initial regret phase. I actually like it now because of what it represents. It\u2019s all about perspective.\n\nAs far as both tattoos go, they become part of your body and even if it\u2019s wild in colors and huge, you won\u2019t even notice it\u2019s there after a while. When you look in the mirror, you won\u2019t see it... it becomes wallpaper....literally part of you. ",
