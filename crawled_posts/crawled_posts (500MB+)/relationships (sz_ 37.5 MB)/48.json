        "selftext": "We've been together three years, married three months. His family invited us to join them on a trip. Our first day there, SO and I decided to have a quickie before dinner. \n\nWe gave his mother a spare key card to our room just in case, but we did not expect her to use it. I guess we were running late for dinner. She came up to see what was taking so long, tried to open the door, unlocked it on her own (even though we put the do not disturb thing up) and caught us. She stared for a second and then ran out embarrassed. My husband and I burst out laughing. He closed the door, we finished ~~because we're monsters~~ and went down to dinner expecting some awkward laughter and a joke or two. \n\nMIL usually makes the innocent sex joke here and there so we didn't expect her to be traumatized or anything. But she has really made a point to direct weird, shameful remarks at me. Implying I'm a *hussy* for fucking my husband, while conveniently ignoring the fact that she ignored all the signs and unlocked the door on her own. \n\nSO has tried to talk to her but she \"can't look at him\". The rest of the family has no idea what happened. \n\nTL;DR: on family trip. SO were having sex in our hotel room. MIL has spare key. She unlocked the door and walked in on us. Now she keeps trying to make me feel bad for having sex with my husband. ",

            "If she continues to refuse to talk to him, he could write her a clear note, or email or something, saying \"My wife and I had sex and you unfortunately walked in on us, despite having do not disturb signs up.  We aren't ashamed of what we did, and if you have a problem with it I'm not sure what to tell you.  But I WILL tell you that your comments degrading and shaming my wife need to end, or we will have to have a pretty serious conversation.  Do not insult my wife any longer\".",
            "What the heck did she think she was going to find walking into a married couple's hotel room with a do not disturb sign up, without knocking? This is 100% on her. And it's 100% on your husband to tell her to stop the comments right fucking now. I think this should probably be the end of MIL having a key to anything, including your home. If she has a key it's time to change the locks at home. And if she can't stop with the comments, you might need to take a time out until she can get over herself.",
            "I would just make some remarks or jokes back about learning how to read (the sign on the door) and doesn't anybody knock anymore?\n\nShe seriously didn't even knock first?

Simply act as if nothing was seen. If she brings it up simply say \"Oh we don't discuss private matters.\" Change the subject. If she persists, raise your eyebrows and walk away. \n\nI believe within a short time things will revert to normal.\n\nOh - next time? Don't give Mom a spare key since she seems not to understand the basics of privacy and knocking on doors before entering.\n\n\nTake care.\n\n\n*Nana internet hug*",

If you don't, there's still many ways to go about this including asking if she wants to join in next time, getting her hooked on phonics for her next birthday, askign her wtf is wrong with her, etc. the possibilities are endless!",
            "He needs to tell her to knock it off, and if she keeps it up (or if she is doing it front of the family), tell her to knock it off and why (YOU used your key to walk into OUR room without knocking loudly, ignoring signs) in front of the rest of the family, and that if she is going to treat him and his WIFE badly, y'all are going home and instituting a period of no contact until she apologizes. Because she does not get to treat you two like shit.",
            "I'm super fascinated that the crux of this post is that MIL is making weird remarks, but the weird remarks are being glossed over entirely (double bonus confusion that no one else in this thread seems to have noticed?). \n\nYou said there were remarks, you said that it seems to you like she's using the remarks to imply you're a hussy. What has she actually been saying to you? \n\nYour version might be totally accurate. But there is definitely a world where this is all in your head and she's being perfectly fine, and you're projecting the weirdness onto her. ",
            "Why did MIL get a key? \n\nThat might seem like a nitpick, but it's somewhat unusual and could hint at the deeper problem here. Did MIL convince you to give her the key \"just in case\"?  (Just in case *what?!*) If so, that sounds like some boundary issues there. \n\nOn the bright side, this happened pretty early in the marriage and *your husband* can now nip this in the bud.",

I'm sure she's been venting to him.\n\nI find that a lot of mothers just can't let their sons go, the flip side of the fathers who threaten the boys their daughters date.  You're supposed to rear children into becoming adults, and adults have intimate lives that their parents aren't part of.",

Why on earth are you implying that my WIFE is a hussy? We are married! EVEN THE POPE APPROVES OF OUR RELATIONS AT THIS POINT! Or maybe wife should get her own room so that you'll feel more comfortable? HAHA! Your behavior is borderline hilarious. Someone pass the bread, please.\"",

            "\"we finished because -we're monsters- \"\n\nI legitimately lol'd. \n\nAnyways, I think humor is your best weapon here. Don't step on any toes, but keep on teasing her, despite her insulting you. She should get over it, she's expecting married couples to being prudes. Quite childish. Otherwise give it time, might not even be worth clearing things up regarding this.",
            "Sorry, sorry but.. why does she have a problem with you two having sex? Fuck everything else, why is she hung up about newlyweds fucking?? Seriously?\n\nI'd tell her in front of everyone else that you enjoy having sex with your husband and will do so as much as you both want in the future. I'd aim it at her but make it clear that you feel violated by the fact that she walked in right past a DND sign without knocking and is now trying to shame you. Not cool. You will not be shamed.\n\nI'm super confrontational though, if you are not, please feel free to have your husband write her a note.",
            "Sometimes anger is an easier emotion to process than others and it may be easier to be angry at you than her son. \n\nHer reaction isn't appropriate but it's up to your husband to deal with it.  She possibly feels stupid for having ignored/not seen particular signs and is trying to deflect. No one is perfect and sometimes even the most experienced and reasonable of us have a hard time processing certain things. It's different knowing your child is a sexual being to actually seeing it - maybe that's what she's having an issue with? \n\nGive your MIL some space and let her come round. Let her figure it out and don't make jokes about it for a while. Think of her as a small child who is feeling angry, hurt and confused and treat her with the kindness you'd give that child. It will all blow over but now is the time for sensitivity. ",
            "Well that doesn't work. I don't want to read too much into a situation, but it sounds like this sets a bad precedent, both in that she shames you for your sexuality and that she walked in without knocking.\n\nNext time she makes a comment re: you being a huge slut for screwing your own husband (MIL logic at its finest!) he needs to shut it down. Something either like, \"Mom, knock it off, she's not a slut, we're married adults,\" or \"Then I guess I'm a slut, too, for screwing my wife.\" It can be hard for parents of adult children to adjust to the fact that their kids are sexually active, but he's fucking 25. She should have figured this out a long time ago. \n\nOnce she de-ices, hopefully you guys can turn this into a learning experience for her in terms of future key-access. A lot of parents will ask for a spare key to their kid's homes. Remind her that it's only for emergencies, because you never know what you can walk in on when you're uninvited and unexpected! ",
            "Damn, was your husband immaculately conceived? \n\nMaybe she's just a bit jealous. ",
            "Start making \"well, I guess I know who doesn't want grandchildren!\" comments right back at her? ",

You walked in on my HUSBAND and I in our locked hotel room, you do not have the right to judge or comment at all. You were in the wrong here.\" \n\nI think she will get the picture.\n\nIt is completely natural for a husband and wife to have sex. She should be glad her son has such a healthy relationship with his wife.",
            "While MIL's behavior was and is totally inappropriate, I feel like she's completely overreacting unless she walked in on some seriously kinky sex. If that's the case, I could understand why she might be a little traumatized (though really she's still overreacting a bit).\n\nYour husband should talk to her when she's ready to listen or write her a note if she absolutely refuses, saying something along the lines of:\n\n> Mom, I'm sorry you saw what you saw, but you let yourself in without knocking loudly and waiting for a response, and you completely ignored the Do Not Disturb sign. While I understand you are uncomfortable with what you saw, your treatment of my wife is completely unacceptable. We are married, and having sex is part of a happy, healthy marriage. You have no right to shame my wife when she has done nothing wrong. ",

Let's drop it now.\"   \nI don't like all these long explanations that I'm reading because they all detract from the main point that the only person at fault here is the person that used their \"emergency key\" and why? What was she going to do? Keep it short and simple. It's her job to get over it, and she can do that or not, but I would not participate in anything that prolongs the conversation when it's that simple. ",

        "selftext": "I\\[22F\\] am an understanding and supportive girlfriend, at least I strive to be that person. I have been with my boyfriend through his drug addiction, his university failures, him changing into a new university, etc.\n\nFor the past month, my boyfriend, Nick, has been hanging out with my best friend, Emily. They text, they share memes and she knows about him as much as I do, if not more. I am not an overly jealous person but it did make me uncomfortable when I realized that they had been spending hours together, just the two of them. Obviously I confronted them about it and both of them reassured me that it was nothing. During this time he also started bringing up things like, \"he needs his freedom and his independence and focus on his career,\" despite knowing I have been very supportive of his decision to change degrees and have been with him throughout the process and would not come in between him and his career. Recently my boyfriend told me that he felt very stressed in school and needed time to focus on it and wasn't sure if he could put enough effort into our relationship and I told him we could take a break, while he figured out what he wanted. Despite the break (where we agreed to not date other people) we still hung out and there wasn\u2019t any bad blood.\n\nBut yesterday at my best friend's birthday party while I was inside, a friend of mine comes to tell me that Emily has her legs on Nick's lap and he's been massaging her upper thighs and whatnot. Obviously, I tried to be calm, but I did go out and see what was happening. I saw them sitting very close to one another, with his hand far up her thighs and the moment he saw me, he pulled back like he'd been burned. It was so awkward for me as we\u2019d just been out together a day before and Nick gave me the vibes that our break was really temporary.\n\nI confronted them after the party and my boyfriend kept bringing the whole \"freedom\" and \"independence\" thing and I broke up with him for real there because it was a little too much to deal with. I told my best friend, she has hurt me immensely and I left. My bf still stayed at her place after but apparently, nothing happened in between them. Anyway, the next day Emily calls me and she apologized to me, telling me she didn't realize it was such a huge thing and they were just being playful. She then proceeded to tell me that Nick told her he has fallen for her, she again reassured me that I mattered to her most and that she wasn't going to be in contact with Nick anymore because she doesn't like him and I know that is true because he is not her type. But I know that she loves attention, no matter if she's into the guy or not. I don't completely trust her because she did lead him on, knowing how that would make me feel. She kept on promising me that she won't talk to him anymore that she loves me, but honestly, their behaviour have really broken my trust on them. \n\nAs for my boyfriend, I haven't been texting him because he knowingly hurt me, was dishonest to me, despite all the things I've done for him. He still insisted that his school is really affecting him and is the priority, but it's difficult to trust him after his actions. I blame him more as he was definitely aware of what was happening. I feel heavily exhausted and drained because of this and I would really appreciate some advice to help get me back up on my feet as I did not realize how bad this would hurt. I managed to keep my self-respect and calm in front of them, but it really hurt me from within. \n\n\\[TL;DR: Boyfriend tells my best friend that he's fallen for her, and I need to know if I should trust either one of them anymore.\\]\n\nEdit: to everyone who\u2019s telling he\u2019s not my boyfriend and I shouldn\u2019t refer to him, I know and I agree. I also wrote this post like a day after all the incidents happened and I was so used to referring him that way that it came out on it\u2019s own.\n\nUpdate: thank you to everyone for their responses, since posting this, I\u2019ve realised that they are still very immature and need to grow into their own. Some experiences in my childhood and initial adult years definitely helped me with my calmness and understanding in this situation. For now, I would break contact and let them become their own individuals and its good if they learn and grow from this. Thank you for everyone who commented, once I actually realised that it wasn\u2019t me, my whole outlook changed and I do believe that all these comments really helped with understanding that, so thank you.",

            "So your boyfriend wanted to break up but instead of just coming out and saying it, he gave you a whole bunch of crap about freedom and independence and then immediately went and hit up your best friend, making you be the one to actually instigate the breakup. \n\nForget him. That relationship is over. As for your friend, how much did she know about the \u2018break\u2019 you were on? Did she think he was single? It\u2019s still poor behaviour, but it\u2019s up to you if you want to talk to her and see if the friendship can be salvaged.",
            "Oh my god, you are a lovely person and you don\u2019t deserve to be treated like this!! No friend would let her best friend\u2019s boyfriend rub her thighs ! Whilst she was at the same party!!!! Walk away from both of them. Your friend is not blameless. She knew he was your boyfriend. She went home with him!! Honestly - these are terrible people. You don\u2019t need them in your life. Walk away and focus on your other friends and your work. Life\u2019s too short to waste time on these sort of people.",
            "Sis, you deserve SO MUCH BETTER than those two dumpster fires. You deserve a best friend who will have your back, not stab you in it. She is a horrible friend, you owe her nothing.\n\nYour ex boyfriend should stay your ex. You've wasted enough time with him.

            "Damn, that's a lot to process! It'll probably take you a while to recover. \nFor now, I'd cut my ties with that friend of yours. She engaged in completely inappropriate behavior with your ex. Not only did she allow physical contact up until a point where another friend felt like telling you, but, she used your bf to satisfy her narcissistic need for attention. At no point did she consider your feelings! And for what it's worth; she didn't consider you ex's feelings neither. She is a man eater, as they say. \n\nIt is okay to be sad for a while. Right now there is nothing you can do, but in a month or so, when you feel a bit better, it is a great time to reorient your social life. In the long run, you are just better off without toxic people in your life. Take this experience as a revelation of the truth, as something that can help you to become happier.",

I really think it should have read:  *\"As for my ex, I haven't been texting him because we're broken up and we're done.\"*    \n\nBut from what you've written it sounds like you're not over him and not really sure about breaking up.

            "It sounds like your boyfriend and bestfriend are both terrible people and you need to distance yourself from them. Don't feel bad and shitty about the fact that you're in this situation (which is easier said than done) but do take some time to understand HOW you got into this situation. From my experience (and my observations of people around me), we attract what we put out in the world (whether we intend to do so or not). This means that more often than not, when we don't value ourselves enough we attract bad relationships/toxic people into our lives. The best way to move forward is to recognize that you're not valuing yourself as much as you should and find way to reposition your value in your own mindset.. It's a hard lesson to learn but once you realise what an amazing person you are you'll somehow find a way to attract the right people into your life that will truly value you!",

Be honest, here...is this because you were actually that head-over-heels for *him*, or are you terrified of losing your image of yourself as \u201cpatient, loyal, supportive no matter what girlfriend\u201d? \n\nBecause boy do I remember being 21 and determined to be the \u201cchill\u201d girlfriend. It resulted in me staying in relationships with guys that *clearly* were not worth my time and energy, and were showing signs of that well before whatever ended up breaking the relationship. It sounds like that\u2019s exactly what happened here. This guy was screaming that he was not mature enough, not respectful enough, not *kind* enough to be in a happy, stable relationship, long before he put his hands on your friend. Now you can see those things for the warning shots they were, and you\u2019ll be a little wiser the next time you get involved with someone as a result. Don\u2019t forget the lessons you learned here, painful though they are to think about. You do not have to be a doormat to be an amazing partner. The right people will recognize that.",

If he wants to dip his toes into the dating pool, then he can be *single* and do that, instead of this crap he's pulling with you. And your best friend prioritizes male attention over friendships, so now she won't have any limitations with who she can flirt with now that she doesn't have a best friend. \n\nThis is what they chose.

            "My ex did something similar, asking for a break and leading me to believe it was only going to be temporary. Luckily nothing like this happened, but it hurt sooooooo much when I realized he wasn't going to want to get back together after all. It's been six months since we first \"went on a break\" and three months since I last spoke to him (when I consider us to have actually broken up) and it's been so fucking hard. I'm really sorry you're having to go through this heartbreak, but just try to go easy on yourself and give yourself a lot of love. Plus remember that there are literally millions of people in the same shoes as you right now and so you are not alone in your feelings!!!! Take as long as you need to get over him and this situation. I'd recommend completely cutting contact with him.\n\nAs for your friend, honestly I understand liking/needing male attention, I do, but I don't think this girl is going to be someone you can trust again. If you had to explain to her that it hurt in order for her to understand that what she did was hurtful, I don't think she's a very kind or empathetic person. I don't know you, OP, but you sound like a nice person who deserves so much more than that in a friend. Friend breakups can be even harder than romantic relationships, so if you want to just do a slow fade instead of outright telling her that you don't want to be friends anymore, there's nothing wrong with that. Just give yourself kindness and some space for yourself. Good luck!",

Disguising my status as a doormat in the more palatable version of \"understanding and supportive\" allowed me to maintain my sense of dignity while also not having to rock the boat by confronting my ex about his behavior and complete disregard of our relationship. That's how I rationalized my unfortunate lack of self-worth and confidence to myself. But as you've discovered, there's a line between being understanding and supportive, and being walked over. \n\nIt sounds like you handled the situation perfectly, and I can't adequately express how glad I am to hear that you've decided to take the route of self-integrity, and not pursue further relationship with either of these people. Again, stay away from these two. Their actions prove that they do not value you, and have not for some time.

She should not allow herself to be emotionally invested in her best friend's boyfriend. She should stop talking to him.\n\nAnd yeah, of course, dump this guy.

Ain't no one got time for that.  \n\nYour ex-BF?  Yeah, he's done.  It sounds like you had reasons to question your relationship with him in the past - well, this time...you got your answer.  If you always felt you needed a VERY clear one, this is it.\n\nYour friend?  Well, none of this would fly with me.  Then consider her \"attention seeking\" behavior in general.  That not only sounds tiring to deal with as a friend, but you can be sure that's going to cause her more issues in the future (and potentially you again if you keep her in your life).  If you think that's the motivation for her behavior with your BF - then yeah, that's a *serious* little issue she has there.\n\nIt's one thing to be \"that girl\" at a party or bar.  It's a WHOLE different story when you're draping yourself all over your \"friend's\" BF's...*that you don't even like*.\n\nWhether her behavior is driven by these impulses or she actually has feelings for him doesn't matter in the end.  Not to you anymore anyway.  If they DO stay involved - whatever.  That's his loss and he's her problem now.  They sound like a good match for each other.\n\nYou want to give her a chance?  Alright, that's your choice.  Will you EVER trust her around your BF's again?  \n\nI'm a 35/M and I can tell you that I'd have no problem with a buddy at my place having beers with my GF while I wasn't there.  If I thought for a second that would be potential problem, then it looks I have a problem with one or both of them.  I don't keep people in my life I don't trust - full stop.\n\n> Anyway, the next day Emily calls me and she apologized to me, telling me she didn't realize it was such a huge thing and they were just being playful.

Didn't think so...\n\nSorry you've had to deal with this nonsense, all of it.  I'd lose them both, you don't need people like that in your life.

This dude you've been dating sounds like a mix of dead weight and BS.  Ain't no one got time for that.  \n\nFocus on yourself, take up a new hobby, exercise more, live life.

            "She is NOT your friend. You say she likes attention and its just the way she is... knowing it would hurt you she put her desire for attention before you and hurt you. Also, he is a massive loser and once the pain wears off, you are going to be relieved to be rid of him.",
            "I want to start off by saying that you are a mature young lady! I\u2019m so proud that you treated them with respect even though they did that terrible thing to you.\n\nYou should tell your ex boyfriend what you really feel and don\u2019t get back with him. I don\u2019t know if you told him or what you told him when you broke up. He doesn\u2019t deserve your time. He decided to hide it from you. He knew what he was doing.\n\nAlso, I read your other replies to comments and it seems like your friend is toxic. \n\nMy suggestion is to stop being friends with Emily. I wouldn\u2019t be best friends with her again. If you want to be friends with her again, don\u2019t tell her anything deep about your relationships. She broke your trust even though she knew you loved him. If she can do that to your relationship, she isn\u2019t worth your time in the future. I think you should cut her off completely and start fresh. She decided that her cravings for attention were more important than your feelings and relationship. Also, be honest with her about what you think and how her actions affected you. Tell her what your plans are for your friendship in the future. \n\nAnyway, It doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019d do this based on your post but don\u2019t date anyone as a rebound. It\u2019s worse in the end. To feel better, I suggest socializing with new people. Get new friends, enjoy time with your loved ones, pick up a new hobby. Just focus on yourself. \n\nMaybe even go to therapy? I know people always think the situation has to be extremely traumatic to go to therapy, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. Therapists are there to support you through anything. If you don\u2019t like that, talk to a trusted loved one or write it down in a journal. \n\nI hope everything goes well. You\u2019re worthy of love and you can get through this!!\n\nEdit: clarification",
            "That's not freedom and independence. That's cheating. She of all people should have been loyal enough to you and tell him no.

They started with \"it was nothing\" to being fucking behind my back. After I broke up I was a mess, my grades dropped, I was depressed & still am not able to trust people easily. I struggled to move on & although initially it was tough but I did move on. Trust me you can too. \n\nWhile I was at my lowest they started fully dating each other. It hurt. It hurt a lot especially because it was none other than my bestie doing it. \n\nFast forward to 5 yrs & I get a dm in my insta from an unknown profile asking if we could talk. I said I don't talk to strangers & that's when he said that he was my ex & he regretted cheating on me with her & if I could give him a second chance. I definitely replied with a NO. \n\nAs for her I came to know from a mutual friend that she had to seek counseling & dropped out of uni. She was too devastated coz he was cheating on her with her distant cousin whom he met at my bestie's bday party.\n\nSo the thing is focus on yourself now. Cry & let the pain out for a few weeks or month. But don't waste too much time thinking about it. Channel your anger on to something. This helped me a lot. I learned to play guitar during that time.

It\u2019s up to you whether or not you feel your friendship is worth salvaging. If you tell her how you feel and she gets mad, defensive or even apologizes but then go backs to her old ways then you may have outgrown the friendship.

If it weren\u2019t for you supporting him would he have worked on himself as much?

            "I am so very sorry about all this. To be betrayed once is bad enough, but to have two people betray you at the same time - your \"boyfriend\" and your \"best friend\" - is the worst kind of betrayal. I commend you on how well you kept it together and how you broke up with him immediately and told Emily how much she hurt you. I don't think either one of them are good people. The friend who told you what was happening? Now, she's a good friend. Everyone else was just going to sit there and let those two do you that way WHILE YOU WERE ON THE SAME DAMN PREMISES, but that one friend let you know what was really going on. (Maybe the other people were frozen in shock, didn't want to get involved, or maybe your friend was the only one who saw it at the time, who knows. It doesn't make Emily and his behavior any less bold and disrespectful, though.)\n\nBy the way you describe Emily's behavior, she was never your friend, much less a best friend. Anyone who gives a damn about someone other than themselves wouldn't message their so-called best friend's boyfriend behind their back like that and flirt away. And your ex-bf is a piece of work, too. He used you and put you through the ringer while he was flirting away with some other chic who didn't put in the hard work you did.\n\nTwo things to learn from this: 1. Real friends don't clamor for attention above all else. They are as equally invested in you as you are in them. 2. Being the \"cool girlfriend\" is not worth the sacrifice. Don't make someone a priority who treats you like an option. Someone who could toss you away so easily when you were by his side through the worst of it is not good boyfriend material. And no, it wasn't his school work that was getting in the way of his relationship. He was growing tired of juggling two women and was too chickenshit to admit that he fell in love with your best friend after lying to you about his true relationship with her. She's a coward, too, btw.\n\nI'd leave them both behind in the dust. Instant block. Never associate with them again. Invite your real friends to get-togethers from now on; who gives a damn what those two think or do. They deserve each other, and if they lose more friends over this, they only have themselves to blame.",

But i cannot understand people saying  you should give a chance to your \"best friend\". Really? What was happening behind you back? It takes 2 to tango. And she was giving permission to him touch her inapropriate ways. They were together sitting and his touching her in the middle of everybody. Disrespecting you. Making you looking fool in front of everybody. And they only stopped because you saw it. Really, maybe she was your friend before, but now, she betrayed you. Dont give her a chance ro do ot again.",

            "Are you also in the 20-21 age range? Don't answer that, but I do get this impression of maturity from you. This looks like a problem of two halves. You handled the first half correctly by keeping your self-respect. I also think it's important to see that you were able to communicate your feelings. I'm just impressed at the maturity you displayed. \n\nAs for the heartache, time heals all wounds. Not really much to say on this side except that it will eventually fade away. You know, this might not be the best advice, but if I want to get over someone, I usually just imagine them taking a huge dump. 80% of the time, it works everytime. Seriously though, relationships take a lot out of you, perhaps use this time to reflect on yourself, as we often give up pieces of ourselves in relationships.",

You say you won\u2019t see her for a while based on your comments, but I do think that you should not plan on putting energy back into that relationship. If she wants to contact you after a while, I don\u2019t suggest you do. \n\nBeing a supportive and not jealous person is an awesome but also consequential thing. But it\u2019s the same for any personality. I\u2019ve heard so many people talk about how being jealous is bad (which it is tedious) and not why unwariness is detrimental, too. There just needs to be boundaries between the two. You are not obligated to dismiss everything that catches your attention. There\u2019s a fine line between not allowing your boyfriend to message a girl about a class project to not allowing your boyfriend to hang out with a girl that he sends intimate messages to. Intimate messages as in texts that he\u2019d send to you. It can get a bit complex knowing the difference, but it\u2019s not saving anyone trying to handle your boyfriend pull excuses out or his ass. \n\nThis is where your bff comes in. She should know boundaries. She should\u2019ve seen that this was a bit much. They were intimately talking so many times a day. He was attempting to take some weird ass break because he\u2019s too scared and douchey to actually break up. They were getting closer than you and your own boyfriend. Let alone practically lying on one another?! Him rubbing her thighs? If someone is rubbing my thighs, I immediately know that they want some smushin\u2019. At any time she could\u2019ve questioned his integrity. She could\u2019ve went to you if she was concerned. It\u2019s almost like she enjoyed the romantic affection. I do feel a part of her knew what was up. \n\nI really do suggest you let her go. She\u2019s only sorry for being caught.",

            "Ha, I can relate to this on so many levels. \nHowever how it happened to me was we were all best friends and then me and my ex started dating for 3 months. Towards the end of the school year I noticed that my female friend was flirting with my then bf and so was he so I got mad and walked away. We argued and he said they were just playing and I was like no, told him I needed a break to re-evaluate my relationship with both of them. Them the female best friend came up to me to apologize to tell me that she would never do anything like that, that our friendship meant too much, that she would never date my ex. \ud83d\ude02 well then came the summer we got back together(3 day) and then he was like I can\u2019t take this and I was like me too can break bc I had trust issues, so we did. Then 2 days after that he confessed that he loved my then best friend, she said no to going out with him. I was taken back and stopped contact with both of them all summer, I eventually moved on started talking to another person (who I ended up dating for 2 yrs). Well it was then August 31 and I was about to make it officially with that guy just to have my ex that same day call me(128 times) he wanted me back, I said no. He then told me dating my best friend was a Mistake and that he loved me. I was disappointed when I found out that they had dated however I didn\u2019t really care bc I was over it. In the end they didn\u2019t work out and they both came back trying to be friends but I denied them back in my life and let me just say life played out well for all parties. My ex now has a nice gf who makes him happy, and my ex best friend is in a on and off relationship with some other guy and I met the loml who I basically live with. Btw This was 5 years ago back when I was in hs so I have no hate for anyone involved. \n\n\nTLDR: don\u2019t stress about it, everyone gets what they deserve. Find better friend and SO. The relationship isn\u2019t worth it.",
            "Your friends behavior is trashy. Being \"playful \" leads to even more tempting areas leading into sex. Just because she's not into him doesn't mean they have talked about the subject. She was letting him run his hand up her thighs probably other regions too before getting caught....\n\nGoing on breaks with a boyfriend regardless if you two promise not too see each other is naive! Honestly, you gave him permission to act the way and he gaslighting you ohh I need to focus on me bullshit. He was really trying to break up with you but was a pussy and also selfish having his cake and eat it too. \n\nAlso he created his own behavior he saw how supportive you were with his faults and you were going to support his behavior with having feelings with your best friend. \n\nThe two relationships are donezo!! I wouldn't bother associating with a friend who is promiscuous and craves attention regardless of how she gets it and the possibility of her hooking up with future boyfriends. Because in a sense you're allowing her behavior and she's taking advantage of you because she knows how much your boyfriend and you went through.  Your boyfriend is self explanatory hes a scumbag and probably will come back around because of how supportive and naive you were because no other girl will put up with that. \n\nYes this will probably affect your future relationships but surround yourself with positive people maybe if this bothers you still maybe seek a professional just to talk with your feelings.",

The fact he was romantically attracted to, not only another female but your best friend, that there itself should tell you that he doesn't love you. I can't tell you what to do but I can only say what I think would be better for you, he really hurt you and you shouldn't give him the chance to hurt you again. As for your best friend, personally if it was me, I'd tell her to do one, no matter what bs story she told you, whether something happened between them or not, she still flirted with him, even if yous had broken up that's still wrong to do, flirting with a friend's boyfriend or ex is just not what a friend does.\n\nI'm really sorry this has happened to you, and I hope you can move forward and heal from this.",

We all go through hard times, yes, but be careful you don't have a \"rescuing-people\" thing (like Hermione said to Harry in Harry Potter #4). It's one thing to help and support people, it's another to take on their problems (not saying you did this; I don't know). And what if you have a crisis? Will this person be as supportive of you, or will they still expect you to take care of them? This guy sounded like a train wreck and I would try to choose someone who's more stable in the future.",

The satisfaction that she got from attention clearly  outweighed the benefits of having a friend like you. She apologized, thats great! But to be fair she got what she wanted and thats his attention. My take on this is, if you want to stay in contact, she should be treated as any other platonic friend that you have. (And even then, will you trust her with any of your future romantic relationships?) It is fully up to you to answer that question. Just do what is right for you not anybody else!\n\nFrom here on, you made it his loss not yours! He lost a wonderful gf.

        "selftext": "Warning, wall of text - but suffice to say this isn't your typical MIL move in post.\n\nMy wife and MIL have a toxic relationship. Most of it is related to my MIL allowing her ex husband to savagely beat my wife as a child and refusing to leave the realationship, even lying for her husband when my wife was finally old enough to tell someone. It only stopped when he abandoned the family for a younger woman and eventually died. \n\nDespite this my wife has saved her mother time and time again. MIL had a Brain tumor when we first got married and her husband at that time wanted to refuse treatment. We basically kidnapped her , took her to the best treatment center, paid thousands of dollars out of our pocket to ensure she got the best treatment and let her live with us for 6 months , my wife quitting her job to be her caretaker, getting her to rehab before moving her back home when she was well enough to be self sufficient. She was given a second chance by my wife. Her husband never visited in that 6 months.\n\nHow did she repay my wife? A few months later called her on her birthday and accused her of stealing $300. Keep in mind she had lived with us for 6 months, we took care of everything, including thousands of dollars in medical bills but her husband had become enraged over a check she had written to my wife when she offered to help with some bills ONE time. She actually threatened charges so my wife despondently hung up, I immediately wrote a check (it wasn't about the money) and a letter about how much she had hurt my wife and they only spoke rarely for the next 5 years.\n\nOne of those conversations was an intervention to ask her mother to please pay for a long term care policy as now that we had children we couldn't repeat the financial commitment we had made earlier. it was about $300 per month and we offered to pay half. Her mother is high maintenance and spends quite a bit on herself but refused to pay anything so we didn't do it.\n\nFast forward to 6 months ago, MIL had a serious fall and her terrible husband let her lie on the driveway for 3 hours because he didn't want to pay for an ambulance. He got his redneck kids to pick her up and take her to ER further injuring her. She was completely unable to walk for 4 months and now is barely able, has trouble dressing herself and going to the bathroom. \n\nOf course my wife saved her again because her husband had her in a terrible facility and she was calling my wife begging to be saved. We took her to a rehab place near us (we live 10 hours away from her home) her insurance paid for 90 days but the last 3 months we've been paying thousands out of pocket while hoping she can qualify for PACE. She doesn't qualify because she's still married and her husband has plenty of assets. He refuses to visit or help out with bills. Her only option is to divorce him and sue him to sell the assets to get herself some sort of cash or at least qualify for Medicaid. She's been kicked out of her current assisted living for refusing rehab and berating staff (she's racist) we simply can't afford to put her somewhere else so until she is divorced she's going to have to live with us.\n\nThis is a depressing reality and my wife has admitted she hates her mother, gets no joy from their realationship but feels responsible for her care. We have a two story home with our master on the bottom so we are having to make our kids share a room and sleep in a small guest room upstairs for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis would be easier to swallow if MIL was grateful or helpful in anyway. She's bossy, entitled, horrible to our children, and just a weird petty person. This isn't just my opinion, I've sat in my wife's therapy sessions and heard her say all these things about MIL.\n\nMy wife knows how terrible she is, how much I dislike her (but don't show it to MIL) but I  understand how my wife has to do this. Any tips on making it work? I honestly don't want to be at my home.  I'd rather work late, travel more and be out of that place. I love my wife and kids and would miss them terribly but MIL makes me miserable and my wife miserable abd she lashes out at me and the kids. Gonna try to suck it up and deal with it but the future isn't bright \n\nTL;DR: horrible MIL moving in for foreseeable future, I'd rather go get my own place, need coping tips",

            "Say no. What if your MIL lives another decade or two and refuses to divorce? By taking this woman in, your wife is committing you, and your children until they flee from home as soon as they can, to living in a toxic environment for potentially 20+ years. This will ruin your marriage. There\u2019s no way around it. \n\nGet her an attorney who will sit down with her and explain her options \u2014 options that don\u2019t include being \u201csaved\u201d again by a daughter she\u2019s abused for her entire life.

            "Your wife is going to live the next several years to possibly decades dealing with this terrible woman, and all because she feels guilty? That\u2019s what abuse does. She\u2019s feeding into the cycle. Your wife needs to break it. The fact that she feels it\u2019s her responsibility to give up her happiness for the sake of family is super unhealthy and I\u2019d worry about how that\u2019s going to impact any children you have. Your wife needs to be able to set healthy standards, because people that don\u2019t often end up showing signs of being negligent and abusive, even if they are the sweetest people otherwise. \n\nGo to couples therapy. Ask your wife to go to therapy on her own too. ",

            "No. She cannot move in with you again. You need to stop providing for your ungrateful MIL. You need to put your foot down, for your family's sake. You are teaching your children to be complacent with abuse. It's not fair for your children to have to live with this toxic person, nor is it fair for them to have to grow up with stressed-out, potentially divorced parents. You and your wife have done more than enough to help your MIL- cut them off and focus on your own lives. \n\nIf your wife refuses to stop enabling your MIL, get a divorce. You need to put your kids first and keep them away from this toxic, abusive influence. \n\nYou continue to enable your MIL's bad behavior. She was in a care facility. She was having a difficult time because she CHOSE to racially abuse staff and refuse rehab. If she continues this behavior, she will continue to get kicked out of assisted care homes. \n\nAs this sub often says, stop setting yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.",
            "Your wife is prioritizing her abusive mother over her husband and children. This is incredibly unhealthy for everyone. If she's allowed to stay, your kids will suffer immensely and your marriage will likely end. Think of your children for a minute - their lives have been disrupted and their home is no longer a safe place. They will 100% resent you both if you allow them to grow up in this environment. You guys do NOT need to \"suck it up and deal\" with being berated and taken advance of in your own house. Please step up and take your family back. Get yourself a lawyer and figure out how to get her out of your home as soon as possible. Your MIL is a victim of her own choices, your wife has no reason to feel guilty. What does her therapist say about this situation?",
            "You\u2019re enabling your wife, and enabling your MIL. MIL had chosen to be a shitty person\u2014abusive to her daughter, choosing a wealthy but abusive husband, abusive and racist to her paid caregivers. She chooses to have money for luxuries but not her care\u2014and she gets what she wants because you and her wife *enable* it. That 1k a month? That could go towards retirement, a college fund for your kids, vacations, a nicer home, it could go to individual therapy for your wife and couples therapy for the two of you\u20141k is half my monthly income, and you and your wife are taking it from yourselves and your kids to give to a wealthy woman who wants to spend her money on toys rather than bills. \n\nNow you want to bring her into your home to abuse you, abuse your wife, and abuse your kids. 71 is not that old. This woman could live for another thirty years. Do you want her in your home for another thirty years? You\u2019d both be retired by then. The kids would be grown\u2014and let\u2019s be frank, will they come to visit after their childhood was spent being abused by their grandmother while their parents sat by and allowed it? No, they won\u2019t. \n\nLet me address something else: if you allow this nasty woman into your home to abuse your kids, you had *better not work late to escape it, and leave your kids to be abused.* That is the coward\u2019s way out, and that is the strategy of a piss poor excuse for a father. You think your kids won\u2019t notice that? That you didn\u2019t have the cahones to put your foot down and protect your own children, who are getting no voice in the matter, who have no choices here, and no way to escape, that you made this choice and then *ran away* rather than deal with the consequences?\n\nIf you don\u2019t want her around you, then **don\u2019t let her move in.** Your wife needs a therapist who specializes in abusive, trauma, and addiction\u2014therapists in these specialties will not push the idea of family above all, are very familiar with toxic family members, and know that sometimes the best thing to do is cut a family member off. When your wife married you, and had your children, she committed to put her husband and her children first. Marriage made *you* her family and first priority, and having children means that both you, and your wife, have to act in the best interests of your children. You are both putting a woman not in your immediate family above yourselves, above each other, and above your children. \n\nYou\u2019re not getting answers to the questions you\u2019re asking because there\u2019s no answer. There\u2019s no way to be happy and abuse-free with an abuser in your home. You, your wife, and your children **will** be miserable, it will do irrevocable damage to your marriage, and it will negatively impact your children, and do irrevocable damage to your relationship with your kids. What you want and what you\u2019re choosing to do here have outcomes that are completely opposed to one another. She\u2019s not moved in yet, which means you still have a chance to make the choice that will give you what you want and will be the best for your family. ",
            "The first line says my wife and mil have a toxic relationship. She cannot move in. There is nothing that can make it okay to ruin the safe place that you and your wife share for an abusive toxic person that\u2019s going to continue to be abusive and toxic. It\u2019s bad now, it WILL get way worse living with her. ",
            "> horrible to our children\n\nThat is just a no no. Do not introduce hostile family members into the upbringing of your own children. This will only hurt.",
            "No, put your foot down. Your wife is allowing the same thing that happened to her as a child. With her it was the husband of her mum, but now it's her mother that is abusing your family and your WIFE is staying silent out of sense of obbligation.\nYou wife and you helped this woman way yoo much, she has a husband, she has a family, it's their duty to care for her, both of you have done enough. \nThis woman in your house may destroy your marriage, because you'll be miserable and sooner or later you'll start to blame your wife for it, even if now you think it's impossible. Same for your kids. Talk to your wife, you both need to keep her away from your family. \n",
            "I think it's pretty terrible of you and your wife to prioritize the happiness of your horrible mother in law rather than your own kids. I feel sorry for them. You and your wife should go into therapy to figure out how to stand up for yourselves and say no. ",
            "Her mother is never going to change. I would suggest posting this on r/justnomil. Just because she's her mother doesn't mean your wife needs to sacrifice everything for her. The lady is an adult and needs to deal with the consequences of her choices, especially if she's going to be that damaging to your family. Let the husband handle her. If your wife washes her hands of her it does not mean she's a bad person. Her mother is not her responsibility. ",
            "OP for every dollar you are spending on your Mother in Law who has the money, you are taking from your kids' lives. Help your wife go into self therapy to deal with all her emotional needs she has suffered and drop your MIL as she has the needs to survive but is relying on you when she doesnt need to.

            "This woman is going to fuck up your kids and they are going to blame you and your wife for exposing them to her.\n\nSounds kind of familiar right?\n\nYour wife has to get her head screwed on and protect her own children the way her own mother wouldn\u2019t protect her.",
            "So here\u2019s all you need to know: \n\nIf your wife wants to accept poor treatment from her mother, that is her business. \n\nIf your MIL is lashing out at the kids and is generally unkind to them, your wife doesn\u2019t have the right to enable this. \n\nHer mother is choosing her situations. It\u2019s time to enforce boundaries. Everyone here is subscribing to that awful \u201cwell she needs help, and this is how she is. Guess we have no options.\u201d Nope. There\u2019s a happy medium: Boundaries around your kindness. \n\nShe needs the care she receives in your home. It is not actually your responsibility to care for her to this degree. Change your logic here: this is the only option for compassionate, adequate care at this time. That doesn\u2019t mean that you put up with her poor treatment. It means the opposite. It means the onus is on her to be decent and watch herself and behavior while in your home. I would use almost these exact words when you and your wife sit down with her to express that. \u201cWe understand this is your only option. We need you to understand that this solution won\u2019t exist no matter what; our kindness depends on your kindness right now. We will have no choice but to return you home if you cannot behave with decency.\u201d \n\nHere\u2019s the thing. There is no point in being a kind person who is kind in spite of cruelty. Your kindness remains the same even if you place boundaries around that kindness; so consider that. You have offered ultimate kindness. It makes no sense to offer it even when she\u2019s unkind to your kids. If she doesn\u2019t meet the basic expectations of human kindness, then it\u2019s actually your duty to pull yours. It\u2019s not always so give and take but here, it is. ",

They will suffer through their life trying to make you and your wife's behaviour make sense to them and it will sabotage their happiness.\n\nBut they can talk to their therapist about it yeah? ",
            "I am so sorry! You really really need to get legal in on this though even if he chooses the lowest of the low, the BEST defense is having someone show up regularly to check. Daily checks, make sure sheets are changed, she is bathed, etc. when they know you\u2019re there and vocal, they do more. If things are truly bad/illegal, call the state with a complaint. They\u2019re not allowed to kick you out or punish you for calling the state. I know you feel like you\u2019re painted into a box, but please please consider other options, you can already see the writing in the wall that this is going to be bad for your marriage. It sounds like her husband knows he can do whatever he wants because you guys will pick up the slack. Unfortunately, mom should have planned better. It is not you and your wife\u2019s fault, and pouring your money, time, and effort into this is going to have long term effects on you and your family, even after mom has died. You have to think about getting your kids through college, and all the other impending life expectancies. You\u2019ve got to figure out how to force her husbands hand on this, and not feel\nBad about it. It is SO hard and emotionally taxing, but realistically, you\u2019re putting your marriage and your family lower than the care for this person who has their own marital assets that should be being used to provide care.

            "I was the kid in a semi similar situation. It started at age 14 for me. My grandmother was not abusive to my mother but the horrible effects of dementia meant that she unintentionally made our lives hell at times. She was non-cooperative for even the smallest, sane things and would spend the nights literally screaming for no reason. She was always the \"star\" of  the show and had high social  demands and entertainment demands we could not meet. We did this for 10 years.\n\n\n\nIt was hard enough having somebody non-malicious but sometimes irrationally selfish. I sincerely felt my well being, mentally, always took a backstep. I developed depression and other mental problems during this time that we're possibly not related to her but have never been addressed due to the time and energy she required. I have lost thousands of dollars in failed/dropped uni courses from these issues. I never had alone time and now instead of getting friends I mostly seek solitude, because I hardly had privacy before...so many nurses, hired home help, their kids, visitors dropping in throughout the day randomly, etc. \n\n\nMy mom's personality changed. She went from more \"with the flow\" to stressed about every little possibilty, because she had to in order to make any given day work. My parents were working long hours only to get home to Grandma's inane insanity and demands. Grandma was always bored and couldn't socialize, but nursing homes were terrible here as she was bedridden and care wasn't up to snuff. I promised myself that I would never do the same thing to my future husband. It's easy to lose who you are and your relationships over time. I cannot really describe well the many minute ways these processes leave scars and change you.\n\n\nThis was with a -good-, non abusive but diva person who DESERVED the assistance and love from my family. She was not malicious. She was not a bad person, this is just the ugly side of USUAL cases of caretaking regarding dementia, which creates bad rationality and situations. \n\n\n\nI am absolutely begging you, do not let you two go through this hell with somebody like -that-. It DOES change you, and while caretaking IS WORTH IT with outside assistance if the person is not a horrible person, you are right in that it will not end well here. Put your foot down if you have to. Especially if you have kids. Having somebody like that around will fuck them up. I developed problems and my diva Grandma sounds waaaaaaaay better than this woman. I would not be surprised if she tried to turn your own kids against you or abuse them as well.\n\n\nYour wife is now uniquely subjecting your entire household to this woman's vile abuse and irrationality. This woman will never appreciate you or your wife as more than a tool. This woman is demanding you make a massive sacrifice of your lives to her without anything in compensation. Tell her to fuck off. She doesn't deserve to alter your life like this. If that pisses off your wife for a while, so be it, but you'll be saving her. Feel free to be the bad guy here, feel free to show her this comment.\n\n\n\nThis woman's love, that she never gave enough of to your wife, cannot be bought or earned, ever. This woman is not rational about her affections and gives it to an abuser and withholds it from your wife.  It isn't fair to your wife but there is no currency, reasoning or sacrifice your wife can give to have a loving and fulfilling relationship to her mother. This lack of parental love has left a void and a desire in her heart that this person has exploited time and time again. The idea of a normal mother is not attainable here and she needs to find a way to understand this, get closure, and move on from this irrational and toxic person. There is no \"this time it will work\", there is no \"one more time because she is my mother\". I would bet money the mother never, ever gave that sort of thought to your wife and any actions that seem like it were underhanded ways to keep your wife baited and hooked.\n\n\n\nBest of luck.

            "When I was a child my father took in my horribly toxic and disrespectful half brother who was 28 at the time because he kept getting kicked out of my aunts house and his mother never cared to send him money even though she has a welloff husband (she forced my dad to send him to America when he wanted to raise his son because she wanted him to be raised in America by his aunt, very shallow women who used her son for citizenship). My brother was brainwashed by his mother to hate my father and treated us like strangers and yet we were the only ones who constantly supported and gave him a place to stay when he lost everything. I understand that he is my brother and I understand that family is family but my brother caused so much stress and turmoil as a child from the age of 10-12 and then again at 13-14 when he moved in again that I became depressed and resented my father for not caring about me and my siblings having a healthy living environment over my half brother and his own self destructive ways. I started acting out, feeling unsafe and uncomfortable in my home, I stopped eating correctly, I stayed at the after school program in my school for as long as I could. This was all do to the stress, the fights, the insults, the resentment, and the anxiety of living in an environment I still look back on those days and feel sad, I was such a depressed child it wasn\u2019t fun. My brother always acted ungrateful and yet my father always tried to make up for the relationship they never had. Our relationship with him is better now that he lives on his own has a child of his own and we only see him a handful of times a year, but my point is your children will suffer.

A big concern for me is that your MIL will not divorce her husband and will try to live with you indefinitely.\n\nWould it be possible for you to have a family therapy/ counselling session with you, your wife, and your MIL to adress the situation? I think it would be very helpful for them both to be told by a professional that it is not your Wife's job to take care of her Mother when your MIL has an able husband to care for her, and to talk about the realities of living together short term and how she should be treating your family and behaving in your home.\n\nI really feel for your family, I have promised my fiance that my mother will never live with us, but I am in the UK where we (for now) have a national health care and so I will never be in your situation (I hope) but I do feel responsible for my mother even though she is an adult and should have preparations in place for old age ect. I have had therapy which has helped a lot with this but the parentification runs deep. I hope your wife understands that her first priority is your little family, and that your MIL understands that too. If you are always there to catch MIL when she falls, I doubt she will ever stop relying on you to do so.\n\nTips for coping with this short term living arrangment:- Days out without your MIL! As often as possible go out with just your wife and kids, free museums ect. if the MIL care has drained your resources. Just get away from her and spend some loving time together. - Make your MILs room nice enough that she doesn't invade the rest of the house too much and you dont really have to deal with her, not so nice that she never wants to leave. -- Make sure the household chores are being fairly split between you, your wife and kids, the addition to your household will probably make some extra work plus will be stressful in itself and this will ensure no one person is taking too much of the strain.- Don't stay away! It will make the whole situation worse for everyone else if they are the only ones dealing with the situation and you are just swanning off, they don't get that option and it might breed resentment.- Lots of therapy or counselling. Make sure everyone is getting all the support they need.\n\nGood luck! And JustNoMIL is normally great, so don't be afraid to go back there, they are very supportive.\n\nPS: In my honest opinion, your Wife does not owe her Mother and support or care, and if this situation turns out to be harmful for her health or your kids or marriage then it should end ASAP. As long as it is an unpleasant situation I can understand it continuing, but if at any point it becomes damadging there is no reason for it to continue. I dont know if your state has ways to surrender adults? I know you can do that with babies, but have no idea how you go about turning over care of an elderly person to the state.",

Right now, your wife is flinching away from the guilt. There is nothing  she won't do to keep the horrible guilt away. Instead, she needs to make and OWN the decision to put herself first.

An abusive childhood will do that to you. If she chose her happiness over her abusers well being, she would feel unworthy, selfish, and lazy. To keep those feelings away, she would cut off her own thumbs. She might even let you and the kids go, because you don't need her as much, nor have you abused and trained her to serve you, so that guilt would be less intense.\n\nYour wife needs therapy to reprogram herself.

The stress of a situation like this can lead not only to marital difficulties, but also with your kids (in different ways depending on their ages). I know your wife feels compelled to help but her responsibility should be primarily on her husband and children and preserving her family.\n\nThat being said, it is very difficult to get over the need for parental validation.

You've been given suggestions from other people here on how insanely toxic this situation is, but you aren't willing to consider sending her back to her husband or leaving her to fend for herself.\n\nYour MIL acted abusive and racist towards the staff at her last facility, and was bad enough she was kicked out.  Your wife acknowledges she doesn't like her mom.  Don't let this happen. Your MIL is mentally aware enough that she knows exactly how to manipulate your wife.  Expect this isn't going to be temporary- the moment she comes to live with you, expect it's permanent.  She's there until she dies.

I am concerned it's going to be bad for both of our mental health individually.\"  If your wife still insists on doing this, insist on discussing the issue with her in counseling together.  You need to be aware of how to set boundaries with your MIL, and you and your wife need to have each other's backs when you're enforcing them.  Also, really - anticipate this is going to be for the rest of MIL's life.  If either of you really think it's just until she gets divorced, wake up.  She's not getting divorced.  She wouldn't divorce the guy who beat her daughter.  And honestly, right now, it's to her personal benefit to not get divorced.

I never had a 'rebellious teenager phase' because I was having too much fun with my dad, going to chess tournaments, attending lectures and debates, taking long bike trips, playing video games - you get the idea. He managed to balance being a good dad with reasonable rules and expectations with also being my friend. \n\nThe only real wrong he ever did me was to not protect me from his parents. They weren't horribly abusive or anything, just manipulative assholes whose tools of choice were passive aggression, guilting, negativity, and martyrdom. By the time I was a teenager I did everything I could to avoid them. My dad forced me to spend time with them when they visited and joined their side when they were attacking me. It was the only time I ever felt like my dad didn't have my back, and I think all the other great parts of our relationship somehow made that betrayal all the worse, because I expected him to stand up for me and believe me the way he would have in any other circumstances. Instead I was on my own, one vs. three. \n\nThing is, Dad had raised me to be a free-thinking, independent, fuck-your-authority young adult with plenty of self-respect. This has served me well as an adult, but it meant that when I hit 18 I had no qualms about telling my grandparents to take a hike, I'd see them if/when I was ready, maybe. This caused a huge falling out with my dad, because as always, he took their side. We barely spoke for ten years, and although we now see each other occasionally and are on good terms, our relationship will probably never be as close as it once was.\n\nI know our circumstances are vastly different, but my point is this: You and your wife are making this decision, your kids are not.

            "My mother\u2019s parents did this to her. They always favorites her younger brother and gave him everything. Gave his kids everything they could ever eat while they left the rest of us in the lurch with Christmas cards covered in my uncle\u2019s kids.\n\nMy grandma had many bouts of heart and back problems along with abuse issues on my grandpa\u2019s part (he basically has moment of psychosis due to the very apparent dementia that has been brewing that he refuses to get care for). Also at some point was addicted to prescription pain killers and after her back surgery went into severe withdrawal. She came crying to my mother every single time and my mother, guilty, took care of her. The moment she was feeling better, she\u2019d give my uncle a ton of money or turn on my mom asking her for the family silverware back (after she gifted it to my mom a decade ago). \n\nMy grandma had a bout of severe low (hospitalizable) blood pressure followed by a bad case of pneumonia. My mom went to help. Spent hours there sitting with her. Brought her snack and kept her company every day after she was done with work. My dad would drive all the way to their house, pick up my grandpa, drive him all the way to the hospital, and then back again in the same night after working a long day at work. Uncle never visited once.\n\nOnce grandma was out of the hospital, she phoned my mom asking where the 4-wheeler was. This 4-wheeler was gifted as \u201cjunk\u201d to my folks for free because gram and gran were selling their farm and had no use for it. Parents took it to try and fix it up. Sat outside our house for three years because my dad never had the time nor money to work on it. Dad decided to sell it to someone who fixed it up (offered a \u201cyou fix it, I\u2019ll sell it for this price\u201d deal).\n\nNot a couple days later grandma calls saying she wants the 4-wheeler back. Mom reminds her that they moved into a gated townhome community. No no, grandma wanted to get it back so she could give it to my uncle. Mom says they sold it to a good home and it was repaired by the same family who bought it.\nTurned into a family feud. Grandma was calling and yelling. Grandpa was calling and yelling. My uncle was calling and yelling. Accused both my parents of stealing and profiting after all they\u2019d done to help. My uncle\u2019s kids destroyed (like total gut-job. Think someone leaving 10 animals in a house and never letting them out) my grandparents home and my parents and siblings teamed together, used their OWN money to refurbish the house so it would sell. \n\nAfter all that, my dad said he\u2019d had it. My mom followed suit. They went no contact with them and haven\u2019t talked to them in nearly 6 months. They\u2019re both happier people for it.\n\nIf your MIL can\u2019t live alone, she needs to go on assistance and you two need to go no contact.

So suck it up. \n\nMaybe you could create a budget of what you are going to spend on yourself and the kids and agree upfront. Then you can spend left over funds on the old lady. \n\nSecond, I think you just need to get a bit more assertive and abrupt around this woman. Rather than you feeling that she\u2019s forced you to pretend to be polite for the next however long, just don\u2019t tolerate her bad behaviour. Could you find places to be when you need to be away from her, do you have a study or a shed? Do your parents live nearby. Can you simply announce you are taking the kids to visit your parents etc?",
            "I understand it's family.. but at some stage your kids have to come first. The most important thing is they are safe, happy and have a stable home enivornment. None of this is fair on your kids. This isn't 'just for the weekend'. It's not a viable long term solution.",
            "You drop her off with her husband and leave. You refuse to take her into your home or pay for any of her bills. Maybe if she were a decent person, I'd say you should do what you can to help her out. But since she's a fucking leech on you, your wife and probably everyone else in her life, won't make any good decisions for herself and refuses to divorce a man who literally does not care if she dies in a dumpster, she's made her bed and can die in it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving her in your house to berate you and your children and make your home a place you can't go to is completely unacceptable, and your wife needs to be in therapy until that sinks in.",
            "Wife needs therapy to work out whatever issues make her feel as though it is her responsibility to take care of her mother.\n\nI don\u2019t say that with judgement, or flippantly.  I  get where she is at, and how strong the guilt is at the idea of leaving someone who neglected/abused her, on their own.  Wife was raised in a way that ingrained the idea that HER thoughts/wants/needs are irrelevant and should be put aside.  She has lived by this mantra her whole life.  It may take some time for her to truly see this.\n\nIn the meantime, frame the situation for her like this.   The guilt of not wanting to, but feeling like she has to care for her despicable mother is hurting HER family unit.  You, kids and wife are important.  Kids deserve a better example of healthy boundaries and relationships.  They need to see it is okay to prioritize their health and wellness, and to keep toxic people at arms length.  They need to know it is okay to say no when being asked of too much.  Watching their parents spend all their savings and go into debt (or whatever your specific financial situation is here) because of an imagined obligation is likely not the scene you want to set for your kids.  If she can\u2019t step away from this situation for herself yet, then do it for your kids.",
            "It isn't as simple as most of these comments are saying.  What you need to do in their eyes is all well and good.  You know it, your wife knows it.  But your wife is a victim and the guilt that she has isn't just guilt, this is the effect of years of abuse and conditioning.  When your mother in law put her husband(s?) first she taught your wife that it was your wife's job to be second and third to her always.  That she must not only suffer and she must do it with a mask of subservient acquiescence on her face, but also accept it is her absolute duty to do so.  So being so enraged that your wife would immediately shoulder this burden is not normal to a normal person.  But it is absolutely and glaringly normal from the perspective of someone who comes from an abusive household.  Indoctrination and conditioning can be so acute and debilitating that a person can know something is every kind of wrong until it is their abuser saying it.  It's easier than it should be to throw logic to the wind when it comes to someone that has stomped you down, insulted, berated, betrayed, and harmed you.    I'm very happy to know she is in therapy.  I hope she is still active in this.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis doesn't just extend to her now though.  It extends to you and your own children.  And this is what we call the cycle of abuse.  What will your children grow up learning due to your Mother in Law living with you?  Look at what it has taught your wife and you are already mentally checking out in preparation.  (I don't blame you, but it will leave your kids stranded, nevertheless)  What sort of stress will the both of you extend down to your children when MIL becomes too much on a day to day basis?  What sort of stress will their grandmother put on them herself?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs there any end in sight here?  Is there a cut off date or is this a \"she's a part of the household until she dies\" deal?  It really, really shouldn't be.  Your kids need to be put first.  You, by extension will be teaching them that horrible, mean people should come first.  Imagine for a minute that one of your children has that mentality once they start dating.  Who would they choose, and who would they let into their lives with the mindset that bad people come first?  Or will they adopt your mother in law's persona as they grow and mold into their own people and become monsters all on their own just by living by example?  Which is worse?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, right here I'm going to say, as I'm assuming others have said, that you need to check out r/JUSTNOMIL.  Secondly find your version of an adult abuse agency where you live.  Your way out may be talking to them about what her POS husband has (hasn't) been doing.  He should be held accountable for this whether she likes it or not.  Whether she is of sound mind or not I don't know, but getting power of Attorney may help ease things along in this area or it may not.  You want representation though.  You want a lawyer and you want to find out how that asshole will become legally obligated pony up for what he's thrown in your lap so that she can be relegating to a mid-range facility on his dime and out of your life.  You also should start some couples therapy/marriage counseling right now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is not your fault.  It's not your wife's either... to an extent.  Something of an affirmation you will hear from a place like r/JUSTNOMIL or subs like it, is that abuse victims aren't at fault for what they've gone through.  However when that abuse trickles down the line and starts effecting their own family as an adult there comes a time where one has to say, \"Yes, you went through horrible experiences but those experience are not your spouses/kids fault.  Their abusers are not their burden to carry and yet you are making them suffer for your abusers actions\"  An adult can and should, at some point, decide how they treat others despite what they, themselves went through.  And you do not want to put your children through the effects of her abuse.  The cycle has to stop somewhere.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith what your wife has gone through it will be very, very hard.  But I wonder...  What she went through was so difficult and damaging.  And she came out of it with the strength to humbly cater to a woman who threw her to the wolves time and time again.  She has strength.  Does she know this?  She probably doesn't believe it but she fucking does.  Anyone who's gone through that would.  More than she can realize because that \"mother\" squashed her sense of pride and accomplishment.  What if she put that strength she has in the difficult process of saying No to her abuser and instead refocusing it on her own offspring and the husband she chose that has supported her so much in this?  It will be hard to handle her mother but if she's willing to do that, why can't she direct her selflessness instead to something just as hard but so much more worth while?  Wouldn't her strength be better spent saying no to her mother and yes to you and your kids?  Wouldn't it be so much more worth it?  It is x1000.",
            "I will try to keep my response short and sweet but hopefully it provides you with some insight.\n\nMy maternal grandmother moved in with us (mother, father, younger brother and myself) after she had split from my maternal grandfather at the ripe old age of 72. My mum did not want her mother living with us but while Granny was putting on the waterworks, my dad had an episode of guilt and invited her in to stay. The guilt later turned to regret.\n\nIt was perhaps 4 or 5 years after my grandma moved in when my parents divorced because it was just too much. My dad did not make much of an effort to hide his dislike for gran, as well as a number of other personal issues, and it all took a toll on my mum.\n\nWhile living with us, my grandma was no help and definitely not grateful. My mum was her personal assistance despite her own serious health issues, which grandma didn't take seriously. My mum had a beautiful garden which my grandma took over. She did not engage in conversation, she lacks empathy, she's emotionally numb. She is a very strange woman.\n\nMy mum had lived a very lonely existence while grandma was there. Even though granny was unsociable with us, she would leave her chair in the TV room to sit with mums friends. Eventually mum stopped inviting people over. Now she has no one.\n\nMy grandma is only now living in aged care because she was stupid enough to fly interstate, despite the doctors orders. I live interstate with my partner and invited my mum and younger to spend Christmas with us. Grandma wasn't invited but insisted on coming only because she thought that mum was going to leave her in respite.\n\nAs soon as they got on the plane it was as though dementia has suddenly kicked in. She completely shut down. 2 or 3 days after arriving she still hadn't improved and mum had to call an ambulance. Long story short she is now living in a state she never wanted to move to in aged care.\n\nEven though grandma doesn't live with mum, mum is still burdoned by her and I really wish she would let go of this moral obligation/guilt.\n\nSo long story short, I think that it is a terrible idea to have your mil move in with you and your wife. You will have no privacy, there will be tension and she will take it all for granted. I have no idea how you will be able to get your wife to see differently despite her feelings for her mother. Good luck",
            "Her mother sounds like a narcissist. Growing up in an abusive household myself the only advice I can give is for her to break the cycle.

She has 5 children now, has never worked a day in her life and a partner who has just been arrested. She always asks us for money. My gran was in severe debt when she died (buying things for my cousin and her children) out of guilt and the entire family has suffered because my cousin was never denied anything. She was enabled enough to keep popping out babies.   \n\n\nI know the situation is different, but I had to harden my heart to her or else I would end up causing myself and my partner more anxiety trying to fix a problem (of an ungrateful and entitled person) that I didn't create.   \n\n\nI'm sorry for the long message but please don't let this abusive woman stay with you.

            "Your wife is not the problem, her mother is. Don't leave your wife and kids for the sake of the drama MIL brings. Get family counseling, for the lot of you (minus MIL), as *one cohesive unit*. You and your kids need to hear and understand the inner workings of your wife's mind in a way that only a trained professional knows how to access and communicate with. The counselor may recommend starting one-on-one with her, or one-on-two with you included. Your wife is clearly worth fighting for: she's the kind of person who will go to the N^th degree to take care of family, even family she despises. The fact that she already dislikes her mother is a huge sign that it won't take much counseling to come to a workable solution and deeper understanding. This will probably be the confirmation she needs to make a change.\n\nNow that the whole team is on the same side, let's remember a few things:\n\n1) Racism begets racism. You adults can see through MIL's bullshit, but you aren't with her at all times. As insidious as racism is, she will sneak it into everyday interactions, and bit-by-bit turn your kids. I know because my own dad tried doing it to me, and would have succeeded if it wasn't for my older sister opening my eyes. I still chew back the vomit of his words in my mind when I see someone different, but I never let my abuse become their abuse. It ends with me. Get your kids away from MIL **now.**\n\n2) MIL has a husband, and he has adult kids. It sounds like they're all racist. Ironically, your story sounds like the far side of my story, which I'm willing to share with via pm if you're interested (ie, we could be related irl through our parents' remarriages). Given that she does have another support system, and it's one that is more closely allied with her \"values\" *coughracismcough*, I would say let them take care of their own. You say FIL is a horrible person, and I believe you, but given MIL wouldn't leave your wife's bio dad, she won't leave this jerk either. She made her bed, now she gets to lie in -it- the driveway. Let them take care of their own.\n\n3) Distance allows healing. If at all possible, I suggest moving your family at least 2 full day's drive away from MIL. Why 2 days? Because when the journey takes that much planning, your wife will be less inclined to swoop in and save the day. MIL will literally be in another part of the world (even if all of you live in the States), and she'll have to work with what she has. What she doesn't have is a spineless daughter to manipulate. Counseling and having an awesome support system (you and the kids **right** by her side) will make sure of that.",

Not a lot of people can understand as immediately as I do. \n\nMy mother is disabled, abusive, in a relationship with someone even more abusive than she is. It\u2019s insanely difficult and life ruining and they have no appreciation for the many people who have given their time, money and effort to try to help them.\n\nSo, here are some things to consider. First, everyone is absolutely correct when they say that you cannot have this woman living in your house, with your children, with you and your poor wife struggling with the aftereffects of (and ongoing) abuse. She is a grown woman, who can make her own decisions; she can choose to divorce her husband or whatever needs to happen, if she doesn\u2019t like the home he chooses, and she can do what needs to happen. But she can\u2019t make your wife do it for her, and she can\u2019t live with you.\n\nSecond, it will help to separate out the issues rationally. The emotions are one thing, but the finances are another. I\u2019d roll all the cost of having her in your lives together- including therapy for everyone, and definitely consider a lawyer who specialises in elder abuse as well- and also I\u2019d run up a little projection of the costs of her living in your home, including a long term place for you to stay, if your wife is still in the FOG.\n\nRun the numbers of the various options and see if you can\u2019t pull some more alternatives in. There must be more than those two homes in your area, surely? Then see what you can afford. It\u2019s obvious that caring for her mom matters to your wife, and that\u2019s fair, even though shooting her into the sun is an equally legitimate option. But paying for her care will be less painful than actually caring for her. \n\nIf you get a lawyer, I figure it wouldn\u2019t be too difficult to twist the husband\u2019s arm for what he was paying to the dump, maybe a bit more. That money could help pay for a facility that won\u2019t leave her in her own filth over multiple shifts. \n\nI suggest these things because your wife doesn\u2019t seem to have begun to understood yet that abusers don\u2019t have to be stood by. That can take a while. In the meantime, if your MIL calls your wife begging her to be saved, I need you to point out that the appropriate recipient of that call is her husband, who apparently has washed his hands of his wife now that she\u2019s not useful to him. Clearly he\u2019d rather have a sailboat and classic cars than a happy and healthy wife, anyway.\n\nI wish you much luck. Remember that you\u2019re responsible for your kids and yourself first. If your wife wants to go down with her family you can\u2019t go down with her; you have kids to think of. You\u2019re clearly a decent guy and I\u2019m pulling for you.\n\n",

If so, I would break the ties that bind, because she could eventually sue for this support if you don't find a way to protect yourself. I'd get a lawyer, and just like the rehab center put her out, find a way to use her prejudices and refusal to help herself as leverage to break any agreement you can get in writing (2bd party agrees to maintain payments of X percent.... Or, 2nd party agrees to maintain standard of Health and Welfare of living conditions to include housekeeping and moral standards of discourse (no foul language, etc)....\nWhatever is offensive, put it in writing as a deal breaker AND LOG EVERYTHING.  Video tape the whole house. Gather evidence. \nUsers don't stop using until the people they use can cut ties and get free. Good luck and God bless you all. Except her :-\\",
            "If your wife insists on doing this, your wife should get her own place so you can stay with the kids while it\u2019s ongoing. That makes much more sense than MIL moving in and making everyone miserable. \n\nOr MIL can stay in the place FIL is willing to pay for, temporarily, until she is able to divorce him. Then MIL is the only one miserable instead of all of you. Besides, do you think she\u2019s really going to follow through with the divorce once she\u2019s comfortable under your roof?",
            "I know this is late, but unlike the other commenters, I don't think you should ask for a divorce over this.\n\nAll of the comments I have seen so far are overlooking that your MIL was also abused by her first husband. This is a broken woman. She needs help, like therapeutic help.\n\nSimilar goes for your wife. She was abused, she needs therapy. This is classic behavior from abuse survivors. \n\nSome of your comments say that you get into a fight if you suggest not taking your MIL in and she starts saying \"what if it were your mom.\" This sounds like either a communication issue or a fundamental lack of respect for the other person's boundaries. Assuming it's the former, she might not understand how upset you are about this. She might think you're only upset about having to move bedrooms, pay more bills, etc. Obviously I don't know what goes on in your conversations but I would make sure she knows all of my concerns. Be vulnerable to her. \"I'm scared that this will end our marriage and I don't want that to happen.\" \"I'm very worried that the relationship between us and your mom is going to make the children resent us.\" Etc. Provide examples. I'm not saying to do this to be manipulative, but when you are vulnerable rather than angry, it's a lot easier to talk about the problem. That being said, if she knows all of this but still insists, then it's a boundary issue and I have no idea how to help you there.\n\nSome advice I heard that I really like is to make sure you and your spouse are always united against a problem. Even if the problem is the other person's fault, you have to stand together against hurdles and issues. Specifically related to this, it might help to put blame aside for a while and just figure out how to deal with what's happening or going to happen.\n\nI hope you get through this.\n\nGood luck.",
            "I have been the grandchild in this scenario. I watched my grandfather verbally abuse my mother and basically ignore me and my siblings. It has created an estranged relationship with my parents because her care for him only increases as he gets more frail because she really believes someday he'll tell her thank you and that he loves her.  It is upsetting for me to watch and I can't put my own daughter around that kind of situation so we barely visit or even talk on the phone with my parents.\n\n Its surprising (or maybe not) how much an abuse victim will take and they dont realize the damage they are doing to other relationships. My mother is loving and kind but she will always prioritize her awful father and gets angry and very defensive when anyone suggests she dial back the help/contact and instead doubles down, \"because he's family\". \n\nBe there for your kids and explain  what normal boundaries in relationships look like. Once you do, you should feel silly for trying to live the opposite way to go along with your wife."

Reading the comments ended up being very emotional- full throat constricting, tears and I had to take breaks because I was getting a bit overwhelmed with the advice. \n\nI did take many people's advice and sort of made it my own.\n\nI took a week off work and read /u/Palavras and /u/riendlymarmite suggestions in particular about a memory jar and childhood milestones. Thank you guys and everyone else who mentioned a letter/adoption etc. \n\nI ended up writing a journal that was addressed to them. Once I started I had a really hard time containing how I felt so the letter became quite long. So being the over the top person I am, I ended up on Pinterest, found a tutorial on making your own paper/ 101 book binding and basically wrote a mini journal/letter and then bound it. I also put photos in as well. \n\nI would post pictures but it's a bit unpolished.\n\nI didn't want to commission art work or a quilt because I wanted to do it myself but my SO does embroidery and she says can do a little pixel persong a cross stitch portrait  so we're looking into that too - after our children enter the picture!\n\nI gave them the journal last weekend. They spent Friday/Saturday reading it, we had a very emotional dinner on Saturday especially after I asked them about adult adoption and changing my surname. They were thrilled! They had thought about it too but didn't want to feel like they were taking something of my identity away or pressure me. Cue more tears to the point of my SO joking about gluing tissue boxes to her person. \n\nThis has been a very dehydrating week. Thank you so much reddit, I am so glad I posted here!

It was nice to see that not everyone called me a selfish a.hole and actually gave me great points to consider. \n\n\nI took the advice about making spreadsheets and discussing having separate accounts for things such as \"disposable savings\" \"bills\" \"emergencies/if one of us loses income/accidents\" \"holidays\" \"college found\" etc \n\nI sat Tara down yesterday after a nice day out with our dogs and told her I'd like to discuss finances and our future and asked her how she felt about things. \n\n\nI tried to be as respectful as I could, and I told her that while I respect her need to take care of her family, i wanted us to be prepared so that we weren't left in a dangerous situation ourselves, especially if we want kids, we should consider what would happen if one of us or both dies, or accidents/illnesses. \n\n\nShe was actually very open about it all and agreed with most of it. She said although she doesn't keep separate accounts for everything, she has a set % in mind when helping her family. \n\n\nI knew she had savings set aside for emergencies and also for a house but what I didn't know was that she has started saving for her siblings tuition - a very decent amount)  She has been saving a lot more than I thought she did. I'm still amazed at how she was able to save so much. She showed me her accounts and needless to say I was embarrassed for thinking she would give away all her savings, I should of known she was smarter than that.  \n\n\nI also discussed what would happen if she thought we didn't need something but we wanted it, and consider several scenarios. She wants to travel the world with me so she's fine with that as long as I don't exaggerate with expensive champagne and caviar  for breakfast she's fine with us indulging a little. \n\n\nShe is against wasting money though, so she made it clear she won't be buying expensive brands herself but said she won't tell me off for the things I do, which is fine with me. \n\n\nThe only thing she said would annoy her is if I ever bought an expensive car (100k +) She thinks they're a waste as most lose value pretty fast which is fair enough. \n\n\nThe other issue about messiness, \n\n\nShe actually offered a chore list and asked if I wanted to cook or clean, I'm actually hopeless at cooking and she is the best cook I've ever met so we decided she would cook and I'll help with the cleaning. She doesn't mind getting extra help (cleaner) from time to time as well since we will both be pretty busy\n\n\nWe also decided to have separate wardrobes so that she can chuck her stuff in without messing with mine lol \n\n\nAll in all things are looking good, I now have to plan the proposal, can't wait to start my life with this amazing woman.

For your own family savings, decide on a savings rate and PAY YOURSELF FIRST every time you or she get paid.\n4. Finally, take an evening or weekend personal finance course together. If she can handle surgery she surely can handle that. It will get you off on the right financial track right away. \n\n- GG.\n\nP.S. Part of point 3 above could be an IRA.

We have a wonderful girl who keeps the place tidy 5 days a week from 9-5 and helps me keep the kids alive. It's a great option when you can afford it. ",
            "I don't think you were a selfish asshole for feeling the way that you felt about things. That's not to say that I agreed with your opinions, because I didn't. The point is, when you disagree with your girlfriend/boyfriend on big things, such as how to raise kids and how to live in a home, then it should be a red flag for you and something that you want to definitely talk about with them before you actually get married. So, I think you were right to be concerned and i'm glad you two talked about it.",
            "I'm really glad you sat down and talked this through, sounds like it worked out great!",
            "This is amazing. I wish you good life together!",
            "Good for you man, I was reading your previous post for Red Flags and couldn't find any.  I think a relationship is about finding balance and working towards that as a couple.  I think you two are off to a good start.",
            "Good for you! I hope she says yes :)\n\nAlso my parents have separate wardrobes and it's a pretty sweet deal.",
            "A sane women and a non asshole man.  May the stuff and things be with you.  Is this still reddit?",
            "My wife is the same. She sounds like a keeper.",
            "Marry her on the spot dude, i mean right now, dont do the mistakes i ve done ",
            "When I read your fist post I was sure she was very smart and savvy about her finance situation. Also, very kind and that part that teaching your kids that they are not entitled to everything I agree 100% since I was raise like that too. She is awesome in all aspects and I won't call u selfish because at least u were thinking ahead and try to see everything for a different perspective. the question now is: What r u waiting to marry this wonderful girl? hehe",
            "This girl is my age. I can't even compute. I feel like a child compared to her.  \n",
            "Wow this is beautiful, wishing you both the best of luck and happiness :)",
            "As someone married 12 year who likes to think I have a good one, you sound like you guys are on your way.  Good luck!",
            "I'm so jealous, but so happy for you two. She sounds smart and wonderful, good luck to you both and congrats on the soon to be wife!",
            "Congrats, this is so satisfying to read! ",
            "It is good to hear the both of you will have separate things. Every couple should have their own allowance and their own space. Couples do not need to share every single thing and there needs to be at least some simblance of privacy and boundaries. When two people can be together but respect each others individualism they will last longer than couples with no structure and no respect for boundaries.",
            "Be thankful that you sat down after a nice day with your dogs and not after a nice day with your kids.\n\nGood luck to you, friend!",
            "I think i'm a bit late to give you my two cents worth, but:\n\nFrom what i'm read so far you have a perfectly fine and selfless SO.\n\nOn to some of your points, you said she owes everything to her family. once you get married, you are her family, she at one point she will realise that, and feel like she owes a lot to you as well. I'm only saying she will only become more devoted you the life you guys share.\n\nOnto your point of her being messy. I've found that a relationship is an opportunity for two people to grow together, to help each other adjust and change. You can guide her towards being a tidier person, and she can guide you away from your bad habits too. Also, if she's got books all over her bed, then you're also sure shes not got anything thing else on her bed (you know what i mean?), no offense.\n\nHer buying a house, thats just good investment, having 20k saved up and to spend on a house at 25 is no small feat, you should be proud of her. Not judging her. For this, I look down upon you.\n\nHonestly, i don't see a problem with your SO, i think it's just you getting cold feet. As long as you guys don't have any other issues, communicating for example, then she sounds perfectly fine to me.\n",
            "Tara sounds great",
            "Nice job, OP.\n\nCommunication is the key to a successful LTR.",
            "She sounds like a real catch.\n\nGood luck and much happiness.",
            "Found a keeper, a genuinely good person, which is rare. Plus she loves you.\nGreat ending! Update on the proposal one day soon please. \ud83c\udf88",
            "Wait. Did you talk to her about whether she will live with you before marriage, or not?",
            "Happy update! Good for you. She's a keeper.",
            "Just checking here-- have you been to her native country and seen the way she and her family lived growing up?  If you can develop an intuition for the context she brings to interpreting value of things, that will be really useful.",
            "Note well: marriage in theory is permanent. Give yourself an extra 2-4 years to collect potential red flags in the event of any doubts.\n\nIf you're going to be together forever, being together forever with a slightly different legal status at the beginning won't ruin it.\n\nHowever, marrying someone who you have not seen respond to extreme circumstances involving emotions and stress very well could. ",
            "I just read the original post and my heart was touched. I adore your wife. <3",
            "This is a great update. There is one other thing you could consider re:the messiness. My partner and I have a similar issue where I am very neat and organized while he is the opposite, doesn't fold his laundry, etc.  So we get around it by having separate bedrooms. I know it is considered \"weird\" (at least in America) for a couple to not share a room, but it really works for us! We still sleep together often so it's not like we lack intimacy. We just decided that neither of us could really change our ways with the cleanliness and when we have separate rooms we avoid conflict. Plus I was raised an only child and I guess I've been kind of spoiled in that I've never had to compromise with my personal space. Idk, just something for you to consider.",
            "So incredibly happy for you two! Best wishes on your upcoming proposal and may you two have a wonderful life together :)",
            "Serious question -- can you have your gf have an IAMA so we can hear first-hand advice on how to raise children to be so generous? This is something I really want for my future children but don't know how to go about it. Almost \"Little House on the Prairie\"-style, but not quite so extreme.",
            "Lol your examples are ridiculous. She would be cool with a 94k car? ",
            "> I should of known she was smarter than that\n\nAs someone who will be marrying a future surgeon you should know that it's should *have* not should *of*.",
            "Get a prenup.",
            "I'm gonna give you a secret.  You have her make a recipe list for 3 good meals.  You go out and get the ingredients and come back and set everything up for her, make this a Sunday ritual.  Then you play with her ass and snuggle up on her while she cooks, and have quality time.\n\nWhen you're done you have 3 big meals to put in microwaveable containers in the fridge and sex.  And now she's not doing all the cooking, you're helping PLUS it saves money in the long run PLUS sex. \n\nGood luck."
