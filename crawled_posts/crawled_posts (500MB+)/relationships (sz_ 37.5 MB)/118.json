        "selftext": "First of all, thank you to everyone who responded to my [original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ccaf3/my_43m_daughter_22f_has_started_stealing_to/), harsh words or otherwise. I truly needed them, as I was completely blind to the pain that I was causing my family. I am truly sorry for disregarding the pain of my family. \n\nAfter making this thread and seeing the responses, I talked to my wife and son while my daughter was away, and I apologized for making excuses for her and not acknowledging how much I hurt them. We all cried for a long time and aired out a lot of feelings, and I was forgiven. Then, we all agreed to have a family intervention for our daughter. The deal was that she either goes to treatment or she doesn't get to stay in the home. My daughter was oddly unemotional during the meeting despite our pleas and crying, but she agreed to go to another treatment center about 200 miles away from home. We expected her to return today. \n\nBut our lives changed about 40 days after we dropped her off. We received a call from the police department near the treatment center, and they told us that a young woman was found hanging in a motel that morning. She left a note with her name, me and my wife's names, my phone number, and something along the lines of \"I'm sorry for everything, Mom & Dad & [Brother], but I will never be better. Good bye.\" \n\nShe was finally cremated last month, and we spread her ashes over the park we used to play in. I miss her every day, even though the last few years made us fucking miserable. The other 20 years (I adopted her when she was 2) were amazing, and those are the years I choose to remember. I remember her infectious smile and intelligence and how she could make me melt  without even trying. We all separately admitted to choosing to remember her this way, and not in the way she ultimately ended up. \n\nWe're all in counseling, both family counseling and one-on-one. Each of us go there 3 days per week, and we are becoming stronger as a family day by day. But there is still a gaping hole in my heart that I'm not sure will ever close. \n\n**tldr: my child committed suicide after leaving treatment early. we're devastated.**",

            "So so sorry. There are no words to comfort your family, I know, but I wish you well in your healing. You lost a child, one of the worst things imaginable and that hole will never close. And that's ok. ",
            "I am *so* sorry. This is heart breaking. But you did the right thing by holding an intervention, giving her the ultimatum, and sending her to treatment. I hope you never doubt your decision to do that. \n\nWhen I was 22, my parents gave me the same ultimatum, for the same reasons, and I ended up in treatment 2 states away. I relapsed after treatment, while still in that state and tiny treatment town, and thankfully that was short lived. My sobriety date is 2 days after my birthday, and I just recently got 3 years sober. I can't tell you how much I wish your update was a happier one, and I really can't put into words how sorry I truly am for not only you and your family, but also your daughter. The guilt and shame addicts experience once they get sober is honestly awful. It can and has lead to relapses since we don't know how to properly deal with our emotions anymore, we numbed them for so long.\n\nI've lost way too many friends to heroin, having been in their shoes, it's important that I remember that they're no longer suffering. I hope that you and your family find peace someday. You did the best thing you could have ever done for her. I'm so sorry. ",

            "I am so sorry for your loss. The following is about my sister, a decades long opiate user. Please feel free to come back to it at a later time if you don't want to read it now, its fairly personal.\n\n\n\n\nTreatment, while statistically \"the best\" solution also gas a great number of undisclosed downsides that come in with the individuals who aren't there to get better. The first time my sister entered treatment, she said it was a great way to learn to be a better criminal/addict. \n\nIts also a place where the more intelligent kids whose families have the means to send them to treatment get a sincere dose of the reality of their plight. \n\nIt is impossible to equip a family for this, it is impossible to prepare for this, and it is impossible to imagine this, from start to finish. I can tell you with a straight face that your daughter may have truly believed she was doing the right thing for you. Opiate addiction is an unimaginable illness.\n\nMy sister never had the chance to go to treatment, my family doesnt have that kind of money. She struggled, mostly on the street, for the better part of the past 15 years. She has been a prostitute as well a pimp. A drug runner and a drug dealer. And anything else you can imagine. She finally started begging the probation system for rehab in 2011. She got about 21 days, once. That was it. There's simply no such thing as treatment for a single, indigent woman. \n\nMy sister is finally recovering. All it took was 20 weeks in ICU (broken over three years), a colostomy bag, nearly losing not one, but both of her hands, staph infections, removal of bone, nearly dying several times, I kidnapped her, all the methadone, smuggling suboxone, you name it and finally, after having every single person finally turn their backs on her - including me, the final hold out. After shutting the door for a year, she started crawling out, without my help.\n\nShe became very motivated last year and knew of a way to get herself off the street. She got knocked up, out of desperation. Suddenly, she had a bed in a rehab facility. Suddenly, she had benefits. Suddenly, she had all of these doors flying open. I was still amazed she managed to conceive. \n\nAnd she is really, actually doing it. I haven't had to enable her in any way. We live in Colorado, she doesn't even mess with dabbling in weed anymore, and she is a drug addict straight out of a textbook. \n\nShe fears homelessness more than she fears withdrawal. That's what it seems like it came down to. Its that fear that keeps it going. For her it seems like she had to fear something more, but it didn't become the homelessness and poverty until something more important than her was at stake.\n\nThat sounds positive, and it is, in its way. She still has a struggle ahead as a single mom, but for the first time in 15 years I believe she's clean. I don't check on her, she's been solid as a rock for over a year now. She doesn't lie, shes punctual (probably the biggest tell), and she's fat. The fetus seems healthy, she's due new years.\n\nBut the overall cost, the emotional cost, all that trauma, all the hospital nights, the lying. There were times when I begged her, while she lay unconscious and intubated in front of me, not to come back. I would tell her, after a decade of dealing with her addiction, that it was OK if she quit this time. I would understand. I promised her I would be really sad and it would be really hard, but going through this every year was just too hard anymore. I begged her to just stay asleep. \n\nI would have been happy with her at peace. It is just a motherfucker of an illness. I probably understand it better than anyone who has never tried it, and I don't really know how to convey it. I know my sister. I know she is in such a tiny set of the population of opiate addicts who get to recover, and so does she.\n\nI used to write about it a lot under a different moniker, but she still has a ways to go. She's on the methadone replacement still, the child will be born an addict. We will have to work with doctors to help the baby kick the single worst opioid out there. Hopefully we get it over with early. I do not have kids, but I do have a lot of infant experience.\n\nShe doesn't live with me and I will still never let her into my life in that way. She lives in a private, sober living residence for homeless, single mothers, where she can stay until the baby is 3 months old, then she is out on her own. Her completion of a previous program for pregnant mothers as well as her participation in a study with CU is helping with housing (think section 8) for a couple of years and other odds and ends. That's all privately funded, there's tons of support out there for single mothers, it turns out. \n\nIts an outcome. I do not have expectations of smooth skies ahead, that will maybe never exist, but at least she will have a healthy child at this point. \n\nPlease get your son to see someone. If yes young with no drug experience, get him a proper, fact based education in the topic. This can't continue to be about the scary boogey man heroin, the most evil drug ever. It isn't about that. Its about education and getting them to make responsible decisions, not using scare tactics. She's a walking scare tactic - her arms are visibly half missing - and that isn't enough to scare kids she's met.\n\nIm sorry, this is wordy. Having lived with this with two of my siblings, as well as the suicide of my 22 year old brother, in a certain light I hear where they were or would be coming from. \n\nIt really is peace. I've seen this every way. It is devastating but it does get easier. It will always hurt, but it will get better. I really hate that anyone has to go through this, no matter how long or short. \n\nThe people who are attracted to opiates tend to be the sweeter, kinder, more sensitive ones. The pain of the world is a lot, to them. They aren't scary or waiting to wrong anyone, they don't want to get sick. ",

            "My brother took his life under the same circumstances, he was also 22. This was last November. It's crazy thinking about how they were before the drugs. And wondering how they could have started that despite their good upbringing. I don't know what it's like to lose a child but i hope you stay really strong. There is nothing that will help this except for time. It's gonna hurt and it's gonna hurt bad, it should, cause that's how important she was to you. Best of luck.. ",
            "Don't blame yourself, or the way any of you handled her drug use. As a past drug user, I know these kinds of situations can be extremely difficult to manage, even under the best conditions. Its pretty hard to peel someone away from that lifestyle and mentality even when they haven't been through emotionally destructive times. The path to recovery from drug addiction is difficult to impossible enough, even when you have no history of trauma, and everything to live for... For someone in her position, I can't imagine the pain with which she struggled. Your family did their best, and its nothing but tragic the way things turned out.\n\nInstead, you should blame her rapist. He should burn for what he did to her, and your family.",

            "My god this story is hits me so hard. As many of the other commentor, I too was in a situation almost identical to your daughter's (Grew up in a great home, started struggling with self image and self esteem mid teens, turned to heroin late teens and was kicked out by family for stealing. \n\nI was fortunate enough to have been provided a form of treatment that allows me to live a normal life and keep me away from all that, but I could have easily been in a situation similar to your daughter's if not for Subutex. I commend you for handling this the way you did, it seems that you did everything by the book and took responsibility for the aspects of the situation you could control. My parents really reaaalllyyy struggled and probably could have handled me a little better. They took the \"just don't get high...just don't do it\" approach. When they realized that didn't work and I things around the house were starting to dissappear left and right, they kcked me to the curb. My father was way more concerned with me getting over on him and his pride rather than the condition of his son. Once I was finally kicked out, the real fun began. A crime spree struck the area I was living in like none anyone had ever seen and I was the cause of at least 75 percent of any theft related incident. Over the course of just a couple of months I would say that I robbed over 300 vehicles, broke into at least 50 or 60 homes, and stuck up a gas station. \n\nWhen the law finally caught up with me, i was so numb to it all. The future didn't matter, the past didn't matter, life or death was literally a gamble every day, and I didnt care. Unfortunately (looking back) the judge I went in front of for one charge of breaking and entering for felony, was lenient with me due to my lack of a record and youth. I was released on personal recognizance (basically my word)  and I started right back up again, as I only spent one evening in the local county jail. Again, about a month later I was busted. Only this time I was caught inside of a home. I was held for 30 days and put on 2 years probation with what's known as a suspended sentence of 2.5 years in state prison. This meant that if I violated my probation in the smallest of ways, I would be automatically sent upstate. \n\nThe threat of state prison wasn't even enough to stop me. That goes to show how little control an addict has during a run. After 30 days I got out and again, a month later, I was picked up and help for another 90 days for another B+E for which I was caught red handed again. Only this time with the threat of long term imprisonment, I wanted to stop, but then I didn't, then I did again, it was like I was possessed. Even in jail I couldn't hold on to an honest desire to quit. Upon release I went to an 18 month residential program and stayed for about 8 of them before being fed up with the shoving God down your throat aspect and went to another program. Over the course of the next two years i bounced from program to program (as I was required by the courts to graduate a program before becoming a part of society again) I relapsed about 5 times, but only 2 real runs. \n\nAfter my last relapse, I had just completed probation and was a free man again, i decided to say fuck the program and asked my mother if I could spend some time at home to start rebuilding my life. I relapsed the next day and almost died of overdose. I went straight back to detox where I met an excellent doctor who allowed me into his subutex therapy program and I have been working with him ever since. \n\nToday it's been 3 years give or take, and let me tell you it hasn't been easy. I constantly struggle with my emotions, the guilt of what i put my family through, the families I probably scared shirtless, the heartless nature of my past. But I am fortunate. Your daughter's story is absolutely terrifying and sad and I really really resonate with your pain, though I know I really have no idea what your dealing with. I do want to say that you are not alone. And the story you have to tell really inspires me to be grateful for my escape from hell. Today I am working in my field of interest (IT) and have graduated from college. I wish you the healing you deserve, and hope that you grow from this utterly incomprehensible experience. I know it sounds weird to say, but I also think that your daughter, while obviously in a terrible frame of mind, and mentally suffering, did something fairly selfless. It speaks to her true character. While she apparently knew that she had caused so much pain, and couldn't bear the guilt, she also seemed to understand that she still had a desire to relieve her pain with the drug, unfortunately the same drug that causes all the pain to begin with. She knew that as long as she was on this plane of existence, she would cause more suffering, do solely to her illness. Its hard to understand this even as an addict, the fact that we are not out disease, and we usually bear the pain and weight of the burden associated with it on ourselves. She wanted to end your suffering too perhaps, and knew that this would be the better than ending her life slowly and dragging it out as she continued to use.\n\nThis is just the opinion of an addict, and I am in no way trying to speak for her, as I have no right to do so. This is just speculation, having been in a mind-frame similar, I wanted to share my thoughts. You can message me any time if you need support. Your journey is a hard one, and I commend you for sharing. Best wishes.",
            "I'm so sorry. Not exactly the same, but my older brother passed away from an accidental overdose, so I know the pain my parents went through... I remember being scared at how much my dad was crying. I know what you mean by the gaping hole. My parents did not seek counselling and it took my dad in particular YEARS to get back to normal. He'll never really be normal again, but he smiles now. I don't have kids but imagine losing your child is the worst pain a person can go through. You really did the right thing and did the best you could do, and I'm sure she appreciated the fact that you all cared about her enough to seek help for her. To INSIST on help for her.

            "My family helped push me into treatment, and I celebrated six years sober this past summer.\n\nI go to meetings and speak at treatment centers and I sometimes say out loud that I wish I knew what the magic formula was. I wish I knew so I could shout it from the rooftops. I wish I knew what the magic words were that were said to me that allowed me to push through the insanity of the end of my using days and the first six months of being sober, when I had no hope and knew I wouldn't make it... but just kept trying. I wish I knew what manipulation, what phrase, what encouragement, what piece of hope would work to save someone... but I just don't know. I share what worked for me, and I watch it work for many people, but I see that it doesn't work for many others. \n\nI'm so sorry for your family. I don't know if the hole will ever close either.

[Here](\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3s519n/me_23f_with_my_husband_25m_married_3_months_he/) is the original post if you'd like to see it.\n\nThank you for all of the replies. It was nice to know that I was actually being reasonable in this situation with my husband. To all the people who said my husband is a complete dick or that we should get divorced, thanks but we're okay. Nothing a little communication can't fix.\n\nAnyways, to the good stuff. After I got all the responses, I told my husband that we needed to talk. He could tell something was up and that I was upset, so as soon as I got home from work we sat down and talked.\n\nI explained to him that while I have always not liked that he watches TV at night, I *really* do think the TV being on is what causes my back pain. I told him that I could see why he thought I was just trying to control him with it, but that I loved him and just wanted some relief from an achey back.\n\nMy husband first apologized and said he didn't realize how serious it was. I can sort of be a baby and a complainer when it comes to pain, so I really can't blame him there.\n\nNext, I told him we should figure out a solution that works for both of us. We talked about getting some kind of white noise maker or a sleep mask for me, but I really do just prefer a dark, quiet room. He also didn't think that white noise would put him to sleep. So, our compromise is that we are going to watch a movie or TV show on the couch every night before going to bed (he ALWAYS falls asleep when watching a movie or longer TV show) and then when we go to the bedroom we can just go straight to sleep.\n\nIt's worked the past two nights PERFECTLY. He's asleep by time the movie is over so I just nudge him and tell him to walk to the bedroom and then he falls back asleep immediately.\n\nSo, thanks again reddit! A little communication was the only thing needed. \n\n   \nTLDR: Husband and I figured out a solution. We'll watch a movie before bed so he falls asleep then go to the bedroom with no TV on. \n\n**Edit: Holy shit I can't believe this reached the front page of /r/relationships!**\n\n**For everyone saying to use the sleep timer on the TV: we have already thought of this. It doesn't work because he ends up falling asleep before me and then starts snoring.**\n\n**Last edit, I swear. Thank you again for all of your wonderful suggestions! We're going to look into ear plugs, tablets, eye masks, and all kinds of other stuff for when the movies stop working!!**",

            "Another win for communication!\n\nIn case you need another solution: wireless headphones and a tablet or laptop propped up on a night stand on his side of the bed. Tell him to decrease the brightness setting and just take off the headphones when he's done. If you sleep facing away from him, you'll never know he was watching anything.",
            "Hold up, let's talk about WHY he can't sleep without television. I had the same thing, and let me share with you how I solved it (for the most part).\n\nAnd let's be honest, this isn't a permanent solution. Sooner or later you're going to get tired of watching a movie EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. Maybe this could be a good backup solution, but it should not be your go-to.\n\nMy educated guess is your husband has a similar thing to me: thoughts that are keeping him up at night, or anxiety (which is often caused by thoughts).  He can't sleep with these thoughts, so he needs a distraction, or he will literally be up for hours, if not most the night. BUT if he watches TV, he can distract his thoughts enough to allow him to drift off peacefully, and then when you switch over to the bed, he is still sleepy enough he can still fall asleep without the thoughts creeping back in and giving him little anxiety attacks that jump start his brain back into fight or flight mode. \n\n(BTW, if it is anxiety\u2014and it sounds like it is\u2014anxiety sucks. It's kind of like thinking that there is a hungry tiger in the room. Have you ever tried sleeping with a hungry tiger in the room? Not easy.)\n\nSo, here's what you need to do.:\n\n1. Keep doing the movie thing in the short term because it's working for now. \n\n1. Ask him WHY he needs the television, what does it do for him. Ask if it's thoughts/worries, and if so, what thoughts are they? \n\n1. You can talk about his worries a little bit, but feel out if he doesn't want to talk about it all right away, pace yourself. \n\n1. Find other solutions. Get a netflix/hulu/amazon account and he can watch on his phone with headphones until he falls asleep. \n\n1. Another solution: Reading. He might be emotionally dependent on television, but a good book that sucks you in can have the same effect as television in distracting those pesky thoughts. Getting a backlit e-reader is great because it distracts you the least, allowing you to sleep, but if not, getting a headlamp \n\n1. Another solution: Music/Audiobook/Podcast. You can set a sleep timer on these. Like the book idea, it might initially seem like it 'won't do the trick' because of the emotional dependence on television.\n\n1. Another solution: Get rid of/ease the pesky thoughts. This is the hardest one, and it takes the most self-work. Therapy is the obvious solution, but who has time/money for that? (I wish we all did, but that's beside the point). Making space in your day to sit with yourself, either through meditation or just \"spacing out\" is key. Don't wait for the thoughts to come at you at night, give them some time to breathe during the day. \n\nI used to be entirely dependent on television. Before I moved in with my now wife, I would fall asleep on my couch, and then head to bed, or just bring my laptop into the bedroom. After I moved in with her, I did the phone trick, sleeping on my side and watching reruns on my phone until I passed out. I still do it some times, but I was able to ween myself off it by trying to read until I got tired, and if that still didn't work then going back to the TV thing, **but always using the TV as a last resort.**\n\nYou've already shown some great communication, but this is a bandaid fix. Use those communication skills and dig a little deeper to find an even better solution. \n\nAgain, your current situation is going to get old sooner or later, so start being proactive and figure out solutions now.

You are two different people with two completely different needs when it comes to sleep.   The two of you need to go in together and test out which style of bed will be best for both of you (I would recommend that you spend at least 10 minutes laying on your side to feel if there is going to be pressure in your hips and shoulders,  as well as if it's keeping your spine straight,  which it sounds like your current bed isn't).   I would also consider replacing your pillows.   It's 30% of your total sleep surface and 20% of your spine is supported by it.   Not to mention that for every 1/2 inch that you neck,  shoulders and spine are out of alignment,  there is 20 lbs of pressure to your muscles and joints and the average person sleeps at some kind of 2/3 inch angle (thats 80 - 120 lbs of pressure on your spine)  which is the main cause of everyone's back and neck pain.

So, I know it hasn't been long since I posted on here, but a LOT has changed in a such a short amount of time, and I believe this post warrants its own update. Thank you to everyone on this and multiple other subreddits for their kindness and good advice. You helped me realize what I needed to do to get all these years of emotional turmoil out of my system while still maintaining my relationship with my GF.\n\n(TL;DR at the bottom)\n\nMy original plan with Katie was to go on a break (but not break up) while she went out of town with her family for a week. She'd be healing from the loss of her mother, and I'd be looking into better means of handling my emotions than just bottling them up.\n\nWell, I couldn't wait a week to resolve this. Since that night, this whole ordeal had been consuming my every thought, to the point where I thought I was gonna puke from the tension. I was afraid of both losing Katie, and of facing my feelings. I've had these mental barriers up for so long that the idea of them coming down scared me. My mind kept switching between being stoic, and being ready to burst in anger or sadness. I knew I had to let myself feel, but I didn't want to because of how much it hurt, but I couldn't just shake it off like I'd always done. I was scared, alone, and ready to burst.\n\nLater that day, I got a text from Katie asking if I could come over. She wanted to give me something before she left on her trip tomorrow. I headed for my car without a second thought. I decided that if I couldn't handle my emotions by myself, I'd do it with the one person I felt comfortable showing them with.\n\nOnce at her apartment, I did my best to stay calm in front of Katie, but I was already a mess. I was stammering every other sentence, dropping things, my voice and body trembling. It was obvious I was about to explode. Then, Katie showed me her phone. She said her dad had video recorded her mom's funeral, and asked if I'd like a copy to keep. I said yes, and Katie sent me a link to it on her DropBox, and I started watching it with her.\n\nNow, I was there at the actual funeral. The part that made me so close to crying before was when the preacher and family eulogies described Katie's mom: a nurturing, loving figure you could always turn to when you needed it. Someone ready with warm hugs, a shoulder to cry on, a sense of security knowing you were taken care of. Basically, everything I DIDN'T have from my single father. Every other time I've felt the tears coming on, I'd hold them back like a reflex. This time, though, instead of fighting my emotions, I fought the reflex. I let the tears pool in my eyes, and fought hard to keep my hands away from my face. I could really feel it now; all the years of anger, sadness, pain, and other negativity I'd kept bottled up inside were reaching the surface.\n\nThat did it. After all these years of being so afraid to, I started crying. It wasn't straight-up bawling; it was actually a bit forced at first. I wanted the tears to flow, but some part of me was screaming, \"No, stop it! Shame on you! This isn't appropriate for a man!\"\n\nThen, Katie gave me a hug, gently rubbing my back, saying things like \"It's ok,\" or \"Just let it all out,\" or \"you don't have to keep being strong for me.\" At one point, she said, \"My mom always made me feel safe whenever I was sad. Now I wanna do the same for you.\" That REALLY did it for me. I bawled my eyes out like someone just put all of Niagara Falls into my tear ducts. Katie just kept hugging me, and even kissed my head at one point. At first, I HATED how I was feeling; reliving all the fear, sadness, and hatred for everything my father put me through. This was more painful than any physical injury I'd ever sustained in my life. After a while, though, I realized I was finally getting the kind of love and support I wanted so badly as a kid. I didn't know Katie's mom very well, and my own mom even less, but based on how everyone described her, Katie was doing an AMAZING job of living through her mom's legacy of love and kindness. For the first time in ages, I felt like my feelings mattered.\n\nFor the next 3 or so hours, I just kept crying and crying. Of course, Katie couldn't sit there hugging me the whole time, but she did her best to keep me comfortable as I cried out 7 years worth of tears. She brought me tissues, water, gentle back rubs, and more hugs when she could, letting me know I could \"take all the time you needed.\" She's such a trooper. Not even my own father had this kind of patience for me.\n\nWhen I was finally done, Katie offered to have me spent the night with her. I was too tired, puffy-eyed, and had too bad a headache to drive safely home, so I graciously accepted. She later ordered my favorite takeout for dinner, and we finished the night with Stranger Things, and a make-out session. Katie's definitely a keeper.\n\nKatie's out of town now, but I'm still looking into effective techniques and methods for letting myself feel and cry again (if I have to.) I know all my problems didn't just disappear in one night, so I'll be seeing counseling regularly once my community college reopens in a few weeks. Hopefully, Katie will be feeling well enough from her loss to come back to class with me, too.\n\nTY for listening. :)\n\nTL;DR: After years of bottling up my feelings, I finally let myself cry (with my GF's help,) and I feel MUCH better about it.\n\nEdit: For those of you concerned that I'll start treating Katie like my mother or therapist, don't worry, I'm determined to prevent that from being the case. I can't afford therapy ATM, so I'll be seeing a counselor once my community college reopens later in September. I've also been looking into additional resources, like free online counseling.\n\nAlso, TYVM for all your kind words, advice, and awards! I didn't expect this post to blow up like this!",

            "Hey man. I'm 21F and i have SUCH a hard time showing my emotions to others. Not for the same reasons, since i'm not a man, but because i often had to be the caretaker for my siblings and my father would ridicule me for crying when he would yell at me.\n\nI'm learning about how to open up too. It's hard. It's so hard. But my girlfriend is a lot like Katie - she's very patient and she \\*listens\\* to me, which is something I need. I really hope you guys can stay together for a long, long time.\n\nMy advice? Sometimes it's nice to schedule a time to cry! If something hard happens or if you're just having a rough day for mundane reasons, say to yourself \"alright, at 3pm i'm going to be by myself and have a nice cry\". It's super cathartic and it can really help you normalize crying to yourself. :)",

I didn't see your original post but I did read your whole update, and I'm glad you managed to overcome your fears and let down your walls to your amazing gf.\n\nI'd like to give you a very gentle reminder... Her mom did recently pass and just be careful to not overwhelm her (everyone is different). There's this thing called \"carrying the emotional load\" in a relationship, mostly in reference to women supporting their partners emotions while not receiving the same in return, because their partners cannot manage their own feelings. You're working on yourself (great!) But don't forget you are in a partnership \ud83d\ude0a",
            "I'm so proud of you! This is the start of a much healthier you (I won't link them, but there are countless studies linking the suppression of negative emotions to physical health). \n\nI just want to chime in and say that while your gf is clearly an amazing person, please acknowledge that in the middle of her grief she was taking care of your emotional needs. This should be a one-off, and she cannot be your emotional guide right now. While seeking professional help, please also try to establish help in your existing social circle that isn't currently providing support to your gf. \n\nFor some interesting discussions around the socialisation of men and emotions I can highly recomment r/MensLib.",
            ">\"My mom always made me feel safe whenever I was sad. Now I wanna do the same for you.\"\n\nBless Katie and her mom. This here is true, healthy love. As someone who also found someone who makes it feel safe to express emotions (my parents didn't know how to be emotional supportive in a healthy way), I know how damn relieved you must feel to find someone like this.  I really hope you do go into counselling/therapy and I hope it helps you find a healthy way to express your emotions on a more frequent level. Someone in the comments is advising you to try to name emotions and journal it -- I second that. It's helped me a lot throughout the healing process.\n\nWishing you and Katie the best, dude.  \n\n\n( Edit: Spelling. )",
            "I\u2019m 30 and have recently learned to address my feelings. My friendships have tanked due to lying and concealing how I feel, my family relationships have tanked due to my lying and concealing of true feelings and my relationship with my SO is tanking due to lying and concealing and hiding.\n\nBe open with your feelings. Be your true self, say it how it is, believe in something and stick with it.",

I learned to clam up too. \n\nWhat really helped me was to actually start telling some of my personal stories as little snippets to various friends. It helped me to realize that opening up didn't always mean a big emotional session, but I got to see how my friends would be supporting, and sometimes open up in response.",
            "My husband and I are in counseling and recently discussed a similar topic. He shuts me out of his emotions, in part because of how he feels I invalidate his feelings (I know not your issue). Regardless, our therapist told him to acknowledge how he's feeling daily to himself. To start processing his feelings. (E.g., I got angry when X happened because of Y.) Maybe this involves writing it down in a journal, maybe just in his head. But then he should practice bringing up one thing that he was feeling in the day (or doesn't have to be every day) to me. And I just listen.",
            "Man I'm proud of you this is hard stuff. Our culture asks men to amputate their feelings and use women as emotional crutches/labor by proxy. It's very hard to become 'fully human' because of all the training we received about proper gender roles and expression. And frankly it's killing men. They end up being far less resilient in the face of divorce, loss, and other difficulties.  \n\nI had a very hard time showing my feelings when I was 22 I don't think I'd cried in years and I had a lot to cry about. I'd had a lot of loss. I started working with a teacher that did a very active form of yoga and meditation, which you'd think was totally unrelated to feelings, but the more I tried to get calm and into my center the more stuff came up. It was like I was a lake and the calmer the surface the more the crap at the bottom started to rise up. It was very hard work. I broke down crying in those sessions over what I perceived to be the littlest things. It was hard to take. \n\nI realized that adage about being reed that bends is far stronger than being a tree that breaks in a storm. I wanted to be flexible inside. That flexibility is its own strength. It got easier and easier to let emotion move through me without it totally torquing me up. It took several years of that work to be able to do that by the way. The net effect being that I can handle my and other's emotions a lot better. I don't sit in judgement any longer about what I may feel. I just acknowledge it.",
            "I (50M) understand what you have gone through.  I was an emotional child, and my parents were divorced at a time when only one other kid in my school had divorced parents.  My father was probably more like me, naturally emotional, but he kept his emotions buried and taught me to do the same.  I am really glad that you have found someone who wants to be there to keep you safe while you start letting those feelings out.\n\nI'm also a clinical social worker, and if you need assistance finding therapy, I think you would find it beneficial.  I am a therapist, and I love being in therapy.  I wish everyone were in therapy.  If you just want to chat, let me know.  I feel ya, brah. \ud83d\ude42",

            "As an internet stranger I wanted to say condolences for Katie's mom, but also that I'm so impressed to see how the both of you took initiative in trying to solve this issue between you all while keeping the other's happiness and well being at the forefront. I think you both seem like wonderfully mature and caring individuals and it's lovely that you found a solution together. Katie is definitely a keeper and not the kind of girl you'll meet often in this world, so definitely do your utmost to honor and treasure her because I'm sure she does the same for you.\n\nI just wanted to add something as someone who's very much a nurturer and empath in personality. When I first met my boyfriend he was also very stoic; not necessarily afraid of showing emotion but just not the kind of person who would open up to me or reveal intimate thoughts and feelings. As time went on and we got closer I always tried to get him to open up a bit more to give him the chance to test the waters and see what kind of reaction I would have to him revealing more and more. Eventually, when he saw how much I cared about him and how I only had his best interest at heart and that I never judged him for any thought or emotion he showed me, he became a lot more comfortable with being vulnerable in front of me.\n\nMy point is: someone like Katie will never judge you no matter what you share with her, and I guarantee that just seeing you take this step with her means a lot to her. When you come across a nurturing, patient and loving person like she seems to be, you've found yourself a gold nugget because nurturers never give up on the people we care about. We'll always listen without any judgement or incendiary reaction, so you safely open up to us as much as you want or need to, at your own pace. As long as we feel you're actively making an effort to be better, we'll stick around for the long run. So please don't be afraid of vulnerability in the future and move forward at your own pace. You've got someone there who cares for you a lot. I know you two will be fine :)",

Keep going and good luck!",
            "My dude, I don't know you, but I'm SO happy for you and Katie. The fact she was able to be so nurturing even through a pain so great herself, it's just amazing.\nI've been working with my own bf, who used to bottle up his feelings as well. Seeing his true personality show when the facade goes down, this is just magical. It's worth every second.",
            "I\u2019m so proud of you! It seems like you and Katie have a great partnership. Your communication skills and vulnerability with each other is wonderful to see, especially considering how young you are. I hope things continue to go well for you!",
            "Of course therapy is the best solution, but if you want to try it yourself I have a few things that might help. And Katie can help too, as you experienced. \nThink of actions that trigger feelings + your reflex. Go a haunted house together to feel fear, watch a sad movie and try to tell Katie what makes you sad. Go on a date together and think of stuff you liked. You know she will be there and listen to whatever feeling you have. So when you are feeling lonely, instead of thinking that it's not manly and you don't need anyone, try texting her: \"I miss you\ud83d\ude18\". When you're feeling sad and it's too hard to tell her, ask if you can come over and just cry it out. Crying helps to clear out what you're sad/frustrated about.\nI'm also not good with emotions, and I used to bottle them up until I explode in tears or anger or both, but in my experience expressing my emotions when I feel them(could be mumbling \"fuck!\" under my face mask, or saying no / starting a discussion when I don't agree) help to get over the event and go on with my day without getting insane. I don't know if this will help, but I do wish you good luck!\n\nPS: don't hesitate to tell Katie how much she means to you",
            "I know this will get lost in the comments but order the game, \"Ungame\". It's used by therapists and the like to encourage communication. You have two stacks for prompts, one that's a bit more lighthearted and the other for deeper more serious conversations. Ever so often my husband and I will take it out and play, we flip between the two and we end up talking for hours and learning more about each other. It's great because while he's a talker and can open up, I have a much much harder time. This has helped a bunch and our relationship has become so much stronger!",
            "Therapy, therapy, therapy!! It\u2019s okay for Katie to have helped you open the floodgates but now that you\u2019ve started you need an appropriate avenue for spilling out your emotions. \n\nHealthy people typically have a larger support system they can trust with smaller tidbits of their emotional life. For example I have a few friends I can talk to about relationship issues, a few different friends I can talk to regarding spiritual things, a few different friends I can talk to about my fucked up family, a few different friends I can talk to about my coping mechanisms/my journey to healthier ones, etc, etc...this is a network I have for myself of ~15 people with some overlap, because they way I process, unfortunately, is venting. I spread it around so no one gets overwhelmed until I can afford therapy (which is next month and I\u2019m SO excited).You said in your post, though, that you only trust Katie.\n\nEven if she wants to, even if she\u2019s able to comfort and be patient with you, she cannot be your sole support. She cannot be the sole person you spill everything to. For one, she isn\u2019t trained, so even if she means well she could a) mess up in a response or b) burn out emotionally supporting you.\n\nThis is NOT because you are \u201ctoo much\u201d. This is because humans are a social species and we\u2019re not meant to keep everything inside, we\u2019re meant to \u201cshare the yoke\u201d, so to speak. As you have personally experienced, one person taking all of that on is too much to ask long term, unless they are specifically trained to do so for both your health and their own.\n\nPlease, continue confiding in Katie, but also do what you can to find additional outlets to continue to express yourself. Therapy is ideal, but guided journaling (self help books are  \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb, I highly recommend Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents by Lindsay Gibson. Whatever your dad did do for you, this is an area he did very badly.)\n\nYou deserve to feel your feelings, especially the hurtful ones so that they can pass through you. Every man does. To be afraid of crying is to be afraid of your very self, so the fact that you were able to cry anyway? To express yourself and this pain? That you worked to do it? That\u2019s not weakness, that\u2019s strength. \n\nIt is, ultimately, honesty. Honesty is not a weakness. \u201cMen crying is a weakness\u201d is not a truth, it\u2019s a lie of a power fantasy.\n\nYou overcoming it means you will be able to experience true intimacy.\n\nYou\u2019re doing great and I\u2019m so proud of you. \ud83d\udc9c",
            "Good for you! \n\nListen though: Katie just lost her Mom. You need to be supporting her, not the other way around.

Yes, you should open up more to Katie. But dude ... Her mom just died. She should be crying on your shoulder, not you coming to her for comfort and validation!",
            "Honestly, this is good for you but I can\u2019t help but feel awful for your poor girlfriend. You need your own therapy, not burdening her with all these emotions and making the loss of her mother about you and lack of a good parenting figure in your life.

            "Dude. Good for you. There is no shame in being sad, and in crying. Those are emotions. Having emotions is part of the human experience. You are not being weak, you are being human. :) \n\nI'm in a similar but different situation in that my partner has a hard time letting out any feeling other than anger. Plenty of it is due to things in our relationship over the years we have been together. I think we've reached a breaking point, and I'm worried that it might be too late for us, but if I can give you advice, don't hide your emotions anymore. It's not worth it. It creates so many fights where all we have to do is just talk to each other like people. I'm really happy you were able to let this out, and I thank you for sharing your story.

He stopped me there, and told me how he's been feeling the past few months. He told he how exhausted he is from feeling like he's disappointed me. And how he feels like he's walking on egg shells because if he disagrees with me on certain things, I get upset(to clarify- I'm a very sensitive person and if I feel misunderstood in a conversation, I will cry. This has led to him feeling like he can never be blunt or he has to be very careful in how he words things.) Which is totally valid and something I'm gone to therapy for in the past.\n\n\nIt was obvious to me he was wanting to break up from the first few minutes. We spent the next couple hours talking about where we both went wrong and apologized to each other. I told him I was so sorry for making him feel like I wasn't proud of him and made him feel like he couldn't relax or be himself. He told me how sorry he was for letting himself go. He also said he felt like he was holding me back in a lot of ways and that we both seem to be better versions of ourselves when we're by ourselves, which is probably true.\n\n\nWe held each other and cried a lot. He said he has a lot of respect for me and that I was worth every headache and asked me to please never date someone who isn't worthy of my time. I told him if he needed to go to bed or have some alone time to go smoke that was okay, but he said, \"I've left you alone too many times in our relationship. The least I can do is be there for you tonight and hold you.\" <<<<<--ughh kill me, i love him so much...\n\n\nI'm beyond devastated but I know this is for the best in the long run. A relationship shouldn't be this hard 3 years in. I had no idea how much of his unhappiness was due to me. It hurts, but now I know what I need to work on going forward. I deeply appreciate him coming out with the truth and initiating the breakup because if I thought he wanted to stay together, I don't think I could have gone through with it. I'm not strong at all. I just set up an appointment with my therapist. I hope he can give me something to help me sleep the next few months because I'm worried how this will affect my attendance at work and such. I'm currently waiting for him to get off work so we can start deciding who is moving out(i told him he could stay but he may be moving back to the town his family is in so idk) and how we're going to tell people. I'm going to miss him so much. I feel like I'm dying and feel so sick to my stomach but I know it will get better in time. I hope he finds happiness going forward, he definitely deserves it.\n\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend was questioning our future just like I was and we broke up.",

The fact you were constantly pushing him into therapy when he probably didn\u2019t need it most likely came off as very demanding and slightly inconsiderate of what he really needed.",

Everyone wants pure, sincere, genuine and unconditiinal love, at one point it was just a biological function to encourage breeding for most people, but after being romanticized in movies, literature and music it's become so much more than that.

Sooo...what helps me right now is focusing on other stuff, this week went for DnD(tabletop game), cheered me up a lot, met new people and laughed hard (I honestly feel uncomfortable/awkward around new people, but been trying to open up more lately) , also been going to martial arts classes (surprisingly, you might find it funny, but sparring with others, punching/getting punched really helps to get rid of the anger and sadness), and last but not least, doing some stuff with friends (watching a movie etc, without speaking about your ex). Have only one friend here, so I kinda annoyed shit out of her and her bf I think.. I know it's hard, but try to make some plans. Oh and almost forgot, I've been going to events/concerts etc, for educational porpouses (ate a lot of free samples in there) went to vegan fest (even tho I am not vegan), and yesterday went to a concert and had fun :) So yeah, netflix might be the option, but is it the best option? There is a lot of stuff to do out there, been wondering about dancing classes, also about learning to draw etc actually have no time for everything, same goes for being sad. Yeah, it takes a toll to motivate yourself to do the first step (like going to dnd, 40 new people, and all my brain wants is to be sad, but nope, play the game and have fun :D). Long post, chaotically written, but yeah, all I wanted to say is, STAY STRONG! :)",

            "Also, one of the best traits of my husband is that he stays calm when I cry. Since I'm a teary person, we just power through it and pretend like I'm not crying basically. It might be worth finding someone who understands that the conversation doesn't have to end just because someone is crying. I guess it depends how disruptive your tears are, but for me, once I get my breath I can still talk.",
            "You are amazing and strong and you both sound like great people. This might be a weird thing to say just based off reading some stranger's post on the internet but I love you and hope the best for you as you move forward.

I hope you find someone you love so much you wouldn't even need to question any decision in your life because those decisions led you to them",

We talk once in few weeks. \nAaand yeah - I start dating. Because the truth is I was moving forward when chatting with other men. And currently I'm dating someone.

With both of them, I wish we\u2019d acknowledged it sooner. Love is necessary, but it\u2019s not all you need. I wish I\u2019d seen that, and it takes so much courage to get to that place. I admire both of you, and wish you the best.

Why fight for someone so much just to see them leave?

Love yourself enrich you to greater heights and only then you will realize you don't need a man to make you happy, and your relationships will be more calm and easy to take and live.

            "> And how he feels like he's walking on egg shells because if he disagrees with me on certain things, I get upset(to clarify- I'm a very sensitive person and if I feel misunderstood in a conversation, I will cry. This has led to him feeling like he can never be blunt or he has to be very careful in how he words things.) Which is totally valid and something I'm gone to therapy for in the past.\n\nSo you wanted him to go to therapy for his mood swings because they upset you, but you weren't going to therapy for that anymore?\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a heartbreaking story and I'm sure if you made it clear to him that you two could still salvage things. But you both either needed to go to therapy to learn to deal with your issues or to learn to deal with your partner's issues. If you really feel that way about each other, it's clear that it doesn't have to be over. Relationships have survived a lot worse than two people loving the hell out of each other.",

After dinner, Anna announced that she\u2019s pregnant. I guess because of being over 35 she got this test called an NIPT and now she knows the baby\u2019s gender even though she\u2019s only 12 weeks. It\u2019s a girl. Anna wasn\u2019t supposed to be able to have any kids, so we were all happy for her. Except Michelle.\n\nOnce the dads took the kids downstairs to play in the playroom my parents have set up there, Michelle went off. She said Anna went and took the only thing she has left being best at (having the only granddaughter). I was going to leave because I don\u2019t like being around when my sister fight, but then Michelle brought up the Universal trip and Ben. She said that she knows it\u2019s wrong, but after Anna \u201ctook\u201d having the oldest grandkid from her, she was at least happy that her kid had nothing wrong with her. Especially in the beginning, where Ben had a lot more issues and was really behind. He could barely talk when he was adopted. \n\nNow, Lily\u2019s teacher and other people (her friends parents) are noticing that Lily might have attention problems. Apparently, the whole trip thing just was one thing too many. Even though she admitted that there\u2019s no reason for it and my parents have always treated us the same, Michelle said she\u2019s always felt competitive and second best to Anna. Now even I seem to like Anna\u2019s kid better. \n\nAnna was kind of shocked at all this. She did get a little mad when Michelle was talking about how Lily was better than Ben, but they ended up crying and hugging each other. \n\nI told Michelle I would return the American Girl doll and take a trip to the AG store (which is within reasonable driving distance of us) and let Lily pick it out herself. Michelle said she and her husband will start the process of getting Lily evaluated. \n\nTL:DR! It wasn\u2019t just about the trip.",

            "I'm glad they are getting your niece checked out. Both of my kids were diagnosed ADD as children,  it can be difficult. \n\nAs for the birthday gifts,  a trip to American Girl is a cool gift! I took our daughter to Chicago to AG, we made a day of it.  We had lunch at their restaurant and saw a show at their Theater.  She got 2 new dolls & a few outfits. Now given the cost,  she was almost 12, we wanted to give her something she'd been wanting to do for years.  We knew we'd probably never go back.  She's 25 now & we occassionally get her dolls out of their boxes to comb their hair,  change their outfits & reminisce on that special day she & I had together.  She loved that trip so much.",
            "Your sister sounds like she needs some therapy herself to deal with these feelings of inadequacy.\n\nLily would do well to be evaluated and get some supports for things if she needs them.\n\nBut your sister doesn\u2019t get to dictate that everything from you has to be \u201cfair\u201d in her estimation.",
            "I\u2019m glad they\u2019re going to get Lily evaluated, but Michelle needs to be, too, for different reasons. Holy Hera. This is the kind of damage that if unaddressed, will absolutely damage her daughter and niblings\u2014and their relationships with each other.",

            "Family drama aside... I commented on your last post that it sounded like your niece may have ADHD. If that's what she's being evaluated for, please do some research and check out r/adhd if you do want to get closer to her. She isn't being malicious with how she focuses; she has a disorder and needs more stimulation and direction than neurotypical folks.\n\nShe probably doesn't enjoy amusement parks because of all the waiting and distractions. But she may enjoy a more enclosed and physical activity. What about doing a family escape room, or taking her to a show for a band she likes, or doing something creative together like painting, etc? It's hard when your brain works differently from others and you get left out because of it.",
            "Michelle sounds like she needs to work on some things within herself. Sorry for the drama. \nI have two young nieces and as they've grown up its switched back and forth who prefers to spend time with me more. About a year ago when the youngest just turned 4, she was with me ALL the time. Wanted endless attention and play time and reading books. Now, when the older one is 6 and a half, she spends more time with me talking about school and her friends and who annoys her. The younger one is content to have a good tickle fight and chase around the house and then wants to settle down and play on her own. \nIt's just how things go as kids grown up and develop their personalities.",

            " I just looked through the other thread and there's so much snark toward a CHILD for liking clothes and YouTube and not being well behaved/pleasant.  I hate when, just because something conforms to stereotypes, people turn off their brains.  So much sympathy for one child in the story with special needs, and so many comments basically saying \"well if the girl only likes vapid stuff what are you supposed to dooo????\" Umm she's a CHILD she isn't required to love comic books and DnD to deserve the same care and consideration.  I hope some people who commented in the last thread are seeing this update.",

            "The others gave you good advice on your family situation, I just want to add one thing. In your last pot you mentioned that Lily being on a phone or iPad a lot. This could be linked to her attention problems. The stimulation by smartphone and tablet can already be harmful to an adults ability to concentrate and work productively long term. To a child it is even more detrimental. Screen time should be limited to 30 to 45 minutes at day, ideally at that age. Plus, take into consideration that YouTube, even KidYouTube is not safe for children to be unsupervised. There are many harmful messages sent with some of the content and sadly very bad people who look for kids for dark purposes.   \n\n\nI know you're not in a situation to give you sister tips regarding parenting right now, but IF you spend some more time with Lily, try to get her attention away from the screen and social media at least for a bit.",
            "This is....a lot to process. If I have a family, God forbid I deal with stuff like this.\n \n\nBut OP, I do appreciate you trying to spend time with your niece the best way you can.",
            "Michelle is fucking nuts.\n\nThank you for being kind to ALL the children. The more people there are to outweigh Michelle\u2019s weird jealousy issues, the more chances they\u2019ll have at learning healthy, stable behavior. You\u2019re doing great.",

            "Honestly I'd try taking the tablet away before diagnosing the kid with ADHD. She may very well have it, but tablets are notorious for sapping attention spans.",
            "I feel bad for Michelle. You have to be pretty unhappy with yourself to say so many hurtful things.\n\n I actually think that nine is a really tough time for girls. It\u2019s this weirdly and insanely annoying age. My cousin is 10, and she also can be spoiled and whiny. She has very rigid interests (horses, specific ipad games, certain book series) and has trouble connecting to a new interest. But I find if I spend enough time with her, especially one on one, she gets much better. I have explained to her that you can\u2019t expect people to share your interest and that you have to take turns playing games or talking about subjects that interest you and your interlocutor. So we have done that. I have also told her that she fails to contextualize her interest in a way that I can understand, which ends up being very frustrating. Like she will start talking about the story of a book she\u2019s reading but will not set it up in a way that I can follow, so she ends up essentially grandstanding. So we jokingly get her to set up the story properly. She is very smart but has attention issues as well. She is getting evaluated for ADHD. \n\nI remember myself at that age, and it was a game to see how annoying we could be to other people, like that was funny. For me personally, that was a very vulnerable time even though I\u2019m sure my behavior was super annoying and weird. Having female role models, like my aunt and my mom\u2019s female friends, was very important to my development in retrospect. I actually still call one of them on Mother\u2019s Day.  She never took me to an amusement park or anything like that. She mostly just interacted with me and my mom a lot. She would often come to dinner. She sometimes would pick me up from school if my mom couldn\u2019t. She went on a couple of trips with us. She was an artist, and she hired me for work in her studio for a few weeks, which was my first job when I was 13 or so. I remember she was tough! We developed quite a bond. She never had children, and she gave me this really beautiful, small gold and pearl brooch that her aunt made 100 years ago. I doubt it\u2019s worth a much money, but it is one of the things I treasure most. I don\u2019t think the point is spending money on your niece. The point is spending time with her and giving her individualized attention.\n\nI think it\u2019s amazing that you are championing your nephew. But it kind of sounds like you are missing an opportunity to be a valuable mentor to your niece. Especially when her mom seems to be emotionally unstable and maybe narcissistic. If her mom can say so many hurtful things to her sisters, I wonder what she is saying to her daughter. If your niece is addicted to her iPad, it could suggest that she is emotionally avoidant because of stuff going on at home.",
            "I'm confused about how you can be \"best at\" having a certain gender of child?",
            "I am kind of in the mind set that there is nothing wrong with having a stronger bond with one/some niece or nephew than the others. Growing up, I babysat a lot of my cousins and some of them just bonded with me more. They are now adults and we have really special relationships. \nSame goes with my aunt's and uncles. I have 7 uncles and 3 aunt's and each of us (my 2 sister and I) have different relationships with them. I think the key is to still nurture all the relationships but don't let you or anyone else get stuck on the fact they aren't all equal. Do things with them, try to find common interests but at the end of the day it still may not be the same for them as it is for Ben.\n I remember one Aunt and uncle, that I loved being around, trying to do things with my sisters but my sisters didn't really have interest, but they love hanging out with another uncle a lot for their own reasons and I personally have always and still struggle to connect with him. I think that the idea that every person has to have equal connection is kinda setting everyone up for disappointment. I really think that it's part of the human experience. It sounds like you are trying, and that it just comes easier with you and Ben. That's ok! Keep putting yourself out there with Lily, try to connect with her but again don't let anyone get on you if it's not at the same level.",
            "A competitive nature isn't anything you can reason with. My second eldest daughter is exactly like Michelle. Everything is a competition. Literally anyone's accomplish is a personal attack. Mh daughter cannot be happy for anyone and has to have the spotlight at all times, even going as far as to fake medical problems just to get attention. It's an impossible problem and isn't likely anyone's fault. Some people are just like this.",
            "I hope you will still take some of the comments on the other post to heart, even if it wasn\u2019t all about the trip. The way you talked about Lily\u2019s preferences versus bens was very dismissive and not good. And still the idea of taking one kid on a big trip and getting the other a doll is playing huge favorites. So event though it \u201cwasn\u2019t about the trip\u201d I hope you take a good look at how you\u2019re acting as well.",
            "I can't believe that A) the older sister would actively talk shit about her nephew and B) that the middle sister forgave her for it! Everyone is completely bypassing the fact that the oldest sister is creating this entire family drama over literally nothing (other than her own imagined feelings of inadequacy). To me that is symptomatic of a much larger problem that will only rear its head again. I don't feel like anything was actually resolved I feel like things were just talked over and smoothed out. Godspeed OP.",
            "Your sister is not wrong about you playing favorites. Just because a 9 year old likes different things than you do, doesn\u2019t mean her likes are boring or that she isn\u2019t \u201cas cool\u201d as the other kid her same age. You probably didn\u2019t even realize it, just be mindful of it in the future. \n\nI think it\u2019s great you are taking her to do something fun, too! I think she will always remember going to the AG store with her fun aunt. I am glad this story had a happy ending.",

I have to be honest, I had a really hard time explaining why I had such a need to be on my phone/immersed in something (started as reading at inappropriate times when I was younger because smartphones weren't everywhere) as I got older and a lot of it was just \"I can't keep track of/enjoy/learn from w/e that's going on because it's not stimulating enough\", which got reaaaally bad in college.

            "Sounds like your sister has a serious case of middle child syndrome and creates competition out of nowhere to rectify some ridiculous childhood slight.\n\nBut, I'm so happy to hear things seem to be working out! Harry Potter world is perfect for the nephew. American Girl Doll store (to pick out her own) is also perfect for niece! Maybe you could give her the justice giftcard and tell her you'll go with her to buy the clothes too.",
            "As someone with ADHD whose mom lashed out at me for this realization and took it personally (made it about herself) and made me feel like there was something wrong with me, there are some red flags I feel I must address.\n\nMichelle seems to believe that having \u201cattention problems\u201d has a bearing on her daughter\u2019s worth. This is a classic message that is fed ADHDers that diminishes our self-worth and puts us at greater risk of depression and anxiety. Additionally, the longer it takes us to develop appropriate coping strategies the greater chance that we will eventually succumb to addiction. This is especially concerning because it sounds like Lily is already down that path.\n\nADHD is a terrible, outdated misnomer that is on its way to being replaced in the medical dictionaries sooner or later. Practically no aspect of it is accurate, and these inaccuracies are a huge cause of all the misconceptions. What is being called ADHD is actually just a completely natural psychological phenomenon that describes 1 in 13 humans worldwide, in which executive functions are diminished while other mental faculties including involuntary attention, creativity, empathy, and energy are enhanced. It is a trade-off: one that was advantageous for our hunter-gatherer ancestors but is disadvantaged in sedentary society. And a big part of that is because the judgement from the uneducated makes us internalize shame. Fuck a diagnosis. \u201cADHD\u201d is one extreme end of a spectrum we all fall on, and it sounds like Lily is experiencing at least some common issues that trend on this side of the spectrum. She doesn\u2019t need more judgement at home. Encourage her mom to get her evaluated, and then for Michelle and Lily to **study** as much as they can about the phenomenon called \u201cADHD\u201d and healthy coping strategies\n\nEdit: The only YouTube videos on the subject I know of are Dr. Russell Barkley\u2019s lectures. They are very much targeted for adults, many for *parents*. I highly recommend them for Michelle. I\u2019m sure that there is *something* on YouTube that is written for kids that Lily and Michelle might enjoy watching together.",
            "How nice of you to turn the gift you wanted to give her into a whole experience! Im sure she felt really good about that . I honestly cannot believe how dramatic/petty all of this was though...Im shocked how both of your sisters compare their kids. & how much more  mature you come off. \n\n Maybe I just grew up thinking  some level of favoritism was normal.. I hope they will be careful on highlighting situations like this .  I'm a parent, I feel like this would teach entitled behavior.\n\nYou are ALL family!  It's really not your responsibility to calculate every kind interaction . As parents , they are more than welcome to take her to universal studios on their own dime - if that's what they felt was fair.  I think if my sister took my nephew to universal studios, I might be a little shocked . But nowhere near this magnitude .. these aren't your kids lol. You're just trying to be a fun aunt.",

Overall it sounds like you are a wonderful aunt to all of them.",

Michelle is the sister that seems to have the petty issues.  I am shocked that she came at you about what gift to give your neice.  In my family, what one child/cousin/nephew gets is not the business of anyone else, bc the person giving the gift, is giving it on their own terms, not bc \"so and so\" got a trip to Disneyland so now, you better get \"my so and so\" an epic gift, equally expensive or you don't love me and mine.

            "I'm so glad there is more awareness and acceptance of girls ga ing ADHD. My brother and I both have it, but it manifested enormously differently.  In fact, he got lots of help growing up while I was was only diagnosed used 2 months ago....I am 41 years old. I feel like the trajectory of my life could have been immensely different had I gotten as much attention growing g up instead of being just \"good enough: to fly under the radar.",
            "I'm sorry but your sister needs to have bigger fish to fry. All of this seems very childish and self absorbed.",

            "Lily seems spoiled. Which does start with the parents. Being every kid will have different interests, you can't satisfy all on a trip to one place. Obviously you like to spend time with all but is harder when you don't have any shared interests. You don't and should not have to spend an equal amount on each kid. You do with what the interest is for. \nMichelle also should not expect that. She sounds pretty self centered and selfish. Totally disrespectful to you, Anna, Anna's kids and her own DD. That I would call out and not put up with it. You are a great aunt and try with all of them. Just don't put yourself out or feel guilty bc of Michelle and her attitude. Disgusts me when I see family's and/or siblings like this. \nGood luck hope you come up with some good activities. Don't be pushed or guilted in to it. Glad she is getting Lily checked out. Its a start.",
            "Autism in girls is hard to detect and could be misdiagnosed for ADHD. There are also cases where women and girls are diagnosed with both. I'm in my late 20s and recently discovered I may be on the spectrum. I say all this hoping OP sees this and hoping that if Lily is on the spectrum, that she's properly diagnosed and gets the educational resources she needs to thrive. My life would probably be entirely different if I'd known this crucial thing about myself growing up.",
            "Thank you for doing everything you do for them, and for making an effort with your niece. I know how hard it can be; I\u2019m 26 and aunt to 3 boys and 3 girls, between the ages of almost 18 and 14 months. And my sister is pregnant again. \n\nLike many others have said, I think it\u2019s more about the time and effort rather than the money, so hopefully the trip to AG will help. And hopefully Lily gets the help she needs :)",
            "> She said Anna went and took the only thing she has left being best at (having the only granddaughter).\n\nThat's a coincidence, it isn't an achievement.",
            "\"Michelle told me that if I don\u2019t take Lily, I should do something equally expensive for her tenth birthday\"\n\nSounds pretty entitled.",
