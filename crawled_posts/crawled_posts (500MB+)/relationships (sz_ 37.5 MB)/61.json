        "selftext": "I have an identical twin sister Jessi and we look very much alike. There are small differences but only those who know both of us can recognize them. \n\nBF and I have been together for a year. Things are good between us.\n\nLast night this happened: my boyfriend's mom went out with her friends to watch a movie and Jessi was there as well with her boyfriend. After the movie one of her friends saw Jessi with her boyfriend. She asked her if that girl is her son's boyfriend (I met this friend at a party a few weeks ago). So she looked at Jessi and thought yes, she is.\n\nShe went to her and asked what the fuck is going on. Jessi was confused since she hadn't met her before, and she kept asking her what the fuck is this. At that point she was holding Jessi's arm and she told her to let her go and called her a crazy bitch. Eventually she told Jessi that she's cheating on her son and called her by my name, and Jessi told her that that's her twin sister. She slapped her across the face and told her to stop lying. Her friends then collected her and took her away.\n\nShe then called my boyfriend and told him that she's found her girlfriend with another man. I was with my boyfriend at that time. He quickly got it that she must have seen Jessi so he told her and she hung up. She then left. I talked to Jessi, she didn't even apologize to her. After she found out what she's done, she just left.\n\nSo my boyfriend talked to her again and an apology is not coming. She feels like she did nothing wrong and she was justified in whatever she did since I hadn't told her that I had a twin sister, so she's justified in harassing her like that and slapping her across the face. She said that she expects an apology for being called a crazy bitch.\n\nI'm really pissed at her for what she did and the least she can do is apologize to Jessi. We were planning to visit my boyfriend's parents this weekend but now I'm not sure that I want to go. I can't just sit there and tell her how cute it was that she mistook me with my twin. I sure as hell don't think Jessi should go and apologize to her.\n\nShould I let this go? Am I overreacting to consider this a deal breaker?\n\n**tl;dr**: Boyfriend's mother attacked and slapped my twin sister across the face because she thought she's me and that I was cheating. Now she doesn't apologize. I want to cut off contacts with her, am I overreacting?",

            "Something similar happened to me and my twin, except she was in a different country on vacation when she ran into my (now) ex boyfriends mom. His mom was shocked and upset at first, but she didn't HIT my sister! That's just straight up crazy and unnecessary, If she had done that I would have cut her out of my life. If I was you I would really consider having someone in my life who's first thought is to resort to violence against you when they perceive you to be doing something wrong, and also someone who can't apologize when they are clearly in the wrong. It's nuts that she expects an apology, if I was your sister I'd be pressing charges JUST because she has the nerve to expect an apology after slapping me. \n\nI don't think you should just let this go- it just reinforces that her behavior has no consequences, which I suspect is what usually happens if her first thought was to slap your sister, then expect an apology. ",
            "She definitely owes both you and your sister apologies. She assumed the worst of you immediately and she attacked your sister. There's no excuse for that. If she's unwilling to apologize you are 100% justified to cut her off. ",

            "She sounds like a horrible person. Jessi could press charges for assault, and I certainly wouldn't blame her after she was hit, spoken to abusively, and received no apology.\n\nHow has your boyfriend reacted to this?",
            "Your sister should report the assault to the cops, she was assaulted which should not go unpunished.  I would also stay away from any family gathering until she profusely apologises to your sister.  \n\nShe sounds a little unhinged, and your boyfriend should be completely siding with you on this matter, he should have no issue to you blanking his mother until she becomes an adult and fixes the problem she caused.",
            "Wow. That is an awful story.  \n\nThe mother isn't going to change. Maybe she's so unbelievably embarrassed by her behaviour that she can't even acknowledge it to herself yet (the preposterous defense that you & Jessi should apologise to her! that is rich!). Maybe she'll come around to it, but I wouldn't hold my breath. You're not obliged to give her the space to do that either.  Her actions were wildly outrageous; her 'defense' is ridiculous and *offensive*; she's only going to dig in. \n\nAnd then among the 3 of you, there will always be this outlandish damage done by her, for which she takes no responsibility, and which she's gotten away with--in a way reinforcing that she can act with assault, gaslighting and accusation... with no personal consequences.  There will be more crazy to come.  \n\nI'd stay away from her, no exceptions. If Jessi decides to file charges, I'd expect mom to blow. If Jessi doesn't, I'd expect mom to still be crazy. We're not required to have these people in our lives.... but obviously it will impact your relationship with your BF, likely be a strain as long as you're together. The fact your boyfriend will be 'in the middle' for as long as he tries to appease her is true no matter what you & Jessi do. \n\nLet Jessi decide about filing charges. \n\nTell the BF there will be no contact or communication on your part. The crazy lady ceases to exist in your life; tell him to talk to someone else if he begins complaining about her (btw did he ever say **he** thought this was horrific?). \nSee if your relationship can withstand that crack. \n\nGird your loins for what's to come. She's not done justifying and defending her ludicrous behaviour. ",
            "Your bfs mother was okay to slap you across the face. Let that sink in. She thought it was okay to attack you. \n\n\nYour sister should make a report with the cops. If your bf disagrees, tell him you're not siding with the attacker and will help your sister. \n\nHis mother is fucking crazy. Do not go to their house ever again. ",
            "WTF! She absolutely owes your sister an apology and a thanks for not having her arrested for assault.  The fact that she physically attacked someone, even if she thought it was justified, is scary as hell.  Your boyfriend needs to reign in his mother and deal with this.  If he's not willing to do what needs to be done, I'd rethink the relationship.",
            "It's not your responsibility to let her know you have a twin. Hell, what if it was just a complete stranger who looked like you? Fact of the matter is she accosted another person. Whether or not she felt justified, she still committed assault. Chances are she's way too embarrassed and defensive to come clean right now, but until she does you have every right to cut her out.\n\n\"Why won't you talk to me???\"\n\n\"You hit my sister in the face and didn't apologize.\"\n\n\"She called me a crazy bitch!\"\n\n\"You approached a stranger who never met you before, yelled at her for cheating, and assaulted her... what exactly is your definition of crazy bitch?\"",
            "Absolutely do not visit his parent's house, lol.\n\nThis is a turning point for your relationship. His mom massively fucked up. She needs to apologise to all three of you (starting with your sister). Face to face. \n\nIf bf's mom is unwilling to apologise, bf needs to insist that she does. And you need to insist that he insists. If he refuses, that's the end of your relationship. There is no way you can have a relationship with her unless she apologises, and there is no way you can have a relationship with bf without having contact with his mom. \n\nBf's mom is lucky she's not being charged with assault. That's what I would have done. ",

Even if you didn't have a twin and the situation had been exactly what she assumed it is still unacceptable behavior and she should face the consequences for that. One good thing will come out of this though, you'll get to find out what kind of person your boyfriend really is. If he tries to make you feel like you're overreacting, you should dump him, but if he supports you and your sister in whatever decision you make about the whole thing, you know he's a keeper. ",

            "You'd be completely foolish to continue a relationship with a person who assaulted your sister, and wont even apologize.  Yes, cut off all contact with your BFs Mom.  If that ends your relationship with BF, oh well.  She's your sister.",

            ">Am I overreacting to consider this a deal breaker?\n\nWell, how did your boyfriend react? That's the important information you left out. I don't think this situation is a deal breaker *unless* your boyfriend supports his mother and thinks you are irrational for being angry. \n\nYou are completely right to cut her out. Even if you *were* cheating, how is it a normal, healthy reaction for a grown adult to immediately confront someone with physical violence? ",

            "She doesn't just owe your twin sister an apology but also you! Because she (in her mind) *did slap you* which is unacceptable... When your sister told her that she wasn't you, this woman still thought it was justified to *slap* her, meaning she wouldn't feel any sort of remorse slapping you if you do something she doesn't want you to.\nDo not visit that woman unless your sister and you get an honest apology!",
            "If she can treat your twin sister like that, she can treat you like that. She believes she has the power and authority to treat you like that, lay her hands on you, and physically and verbally abuse you. sure, it didn't happen to you, it was your sister, but in her mind it WAS you. \n\nYou are not over reacting. Not in the least bit. Her response wasn't appropriate regardless of who she did it too. If she believes she's justified in her behavior, it means she believes she is allowed to abuse you.",
            "She  assaulted your sister. I would go no contact with her until she can grow up and apologise. ",
            "Your boyfriend's mother assaulted someone. In public. In front of her actual boyfriend. Your boyfriend's mom is fucking lucky she didn't charge her for assault, the LEAST she could do is apologize. But I don't see that happening unless she recognizes that she has done wrong; which she won't. ",
            "Report her to cops for assault",
            "Okay, so here's what your sister experienced: she's out on a date with her boyfriend, and then some random stranger grabs her and starts screaming in her face, then slaps her in the face. This stranger, who is assaulting her in public, won't believe she is who she says she is--who she *actually is*.\n\nThis is the stuff nightmares are made of. This is the stuff PTSD is made of. \n\nThis woman is fucking unstable, and has proven to be *dangerous*. You shouldn't be in a room with her, apology or no apology. She assaulted someone based on an unfounded suspicion, and clearly would have no problem assaulting *you* if she thought you were doing something wrong. \n\nChrist on a titty-balling cracker, an she thinks your sister should apologize for calling her a crazy bitch? What is her line of thinking there? \"Oh come on, I was just physically and publicly assaulting someone I *thought* was my son's girlfriend; anyone would have done the same, she shouldn't have called me names while I was slapping the shit out of her in public.\" \n\nYeah, charges should be pressed. And if not that, then at the very least never talk to this woman again.",
            "I think an assault charge might provoke an apology, however sincere.  But in all honesty your sister was *needlessly* and *randomly* assaulted by a stranger in public, and I simply would not sit back and accept that if I were your sister.  This has nothing to do with you or your relationship to your boyfriend's mother.  She attacked someone she *assumed* was you and now she should face the consequences for her actions.  The fact that she's now demanding an apology is actually quite insane. \n\nAlso a dealbreaker for what?  Your relationship or you having one with his parents?  Ultimately it is up to you and how much you like the guy, but it certainly isn't over reacting to cut ties with his family.  If that's a personal deal breaker for you in a relationship then so be it - it does make sense and you're not forced to have these people in your life.  You were kind of vague in how your boyfriend responded to it, but he should be siding with you 100% in this because nothing his mother did was normal or justified in any situation, especially since she's refusing to acknowledge her mistakes.  You should not let this go, though.  Maybe show your boyfriend this post?  It might help him see clearer and how detrimental his mother's actions were to his relationship with you.  If he cares then he will make something happen then. ",

It shows a huge level of mistrust that she immediately jumped to cheating, and then a refusal to acknowledge \"your\"  [Jessie's reply] \n\nI agree with the other posters. Your sister should press charges, if his mom continues to refuse to apologise. And in no way is his mother entitled to an apology. You definitely shouldn't be around his family.

            "If your she doesn't apologize and your BF isn't being respectful of your wishes to have NC, then you should probably cut contact with him as well. I don't think you're overreacting at all, you're actually handling it way better than I would. ",
            "This is outrageous behavior. It would be unacceptable even if the mom had caught OP cheating since it's still assault. She's lucky the sister doesn't press charges.",

            "Yeeeaahh I'd pretty much be telling your BF's mother than unless she apologizes to your sister sincerely than she will be pressing charges. She's probably just embarrassed but she needs to realize that her actions have consequences. ",
            "She feels like she did nothing wrong and she was justified in whatever she did since I hadn't told her that I had a twin sister, so she's justified in harassing her like that and slapping her across the face. She said that she expects an apology for being called a crazy bitch.\n\nLol. No way will she ever apologize for anything. Cut her off 100%.\n\nI get your bf is not his mother. Is he willing to cut her completely out of your relationship? if not, then its a deal breaker.  if you get married down the road will he go low or no contact with her-if not, its a deal breaker.\n\nYour sister could report the incident to the police.\n\n",
            "I don't think the incident is grounds to end the relationship, but your bf should definitely insist that she apologize, and if he doesn't, that would be a good reason to end the relationship. You don't want to be in a serious relationship with someone who won't stand up to their parents on behalf of their partner. You'll be thankful for that quality when it comes to raising your children (or even wedding planning, for that matter)",

However his mother DEFINITELY owes your sister an apology.  She attacked your sister for something your sister didn't do, however your sister called her a crazy bitch for something she DID do! \n\nIf it comes down to it, you and your sister should go to the police. That's assault. The cinema probably has security cameras and may have the assault on tape. ",

            "Unfortunately, there's not much you can actually do about this. BF's mom is completely and utterly in the wrong, and should apologize to both you and your sister (especially your sister)... but you can't force her to do so. You *can* tell your BF you're not comfortable spending any time with his mom until she apologizes to you and your sister, but that's about it.",
            "The woman should be a appalled by her own behavior, and should be begging both of you for forgiveness.  Since that didn't happen, you should turn to your boyfriend.  If he's not going to stand up to his family when they wrong you and yours this much, look out.  Talk about a red flag with this guy.",

You gave her a chance to apologize to your sister and she wants one? Yeah, time to call the police and file a report. This woman needs to learn a lesson (not that she will ever change). Regardless, there need to be consequences for her actions. \n\nAlso, you haven't said much about what your boyfriend thinks about what happened. You should both be pissed. And absolutely you should never talk to this woman- or have to see her- again. Her overreaction in the moment is alarming and scary, but her refusal to recognize how badly she fucked up after the fact is unforgivable. The way your boyfriend deals with this will be very telling as to whether you guys can make it past this or not. If he is not 110% on your side, any future you have with him will be riddled with issues because of his mother. ",
            "I would totally press charges.",
            "Some handle embarrassment REALLY badly. To the point of making a small issue something much greater. I'd suggest giving this woman some time to recollect her thoughts.

Remind her physical attack is not the proper course of action in these cases, suggest to her she take a picture instead next time and talk to her son first. \n\nIf she really believed it was you, she probably got really defensive about her son and feels justified for calling \"you\" out about it, wouldn't you do that (or something of equal measure) for your son? She also clearly does not know your family.\n\nI believe an apology for apology is in order. Prescribed by yours truly.",
            "I completely agree this is really insane, but I think/hope her stubborness stems from embarrassment (especially the day after). That doesn't justify hitting, etc., but it can explain it. I hope that it is embarrassment rather than crazy. ",
            "No and yes. She must aplogise to your sister, she's either neve been called out on her behaviour or is one of those horribly embassiesd people who find it hard to apologise, either way you should go with him and get an apology for your sister, if she still refuses then you know cutting contact will the right thing and that you tried like a rational adult to fix the situation.",
            "Yeaaaaaaah. OP, if you and your boyfriend get married, this bundle of crazy is going to be your MIL. Someone who jumps to conclusions, acts inappropriately and refuses to admit when she's wrong.\n\nYou may love your BF, but I'd think long and hard about a future with him.

She always will be crazy and narcissistic. It is not normal behavior to be unapologetic about slapping the wrong person. Hell, she had no right to slap anyone even if she did catch you cheating. You now need to consider this situation when it comes to your boyfriend. Odds are he has been suffering at the hands of her abuse for years, and will continue to. You might want to consider if you want to stick around in a situation like that. Everyone's parents are crazy in one way or another pretty much, but you need to decide whether you want to put up with this to be with your boyfriend. ",

Go to r/justnomil and read some stories there. I'm not saying she'll be as bad as all of them, just that if she's willing to unapologetically slap your sister because of a suspicion, she's willing to never trust you again and hold a grudge for years.

            "I have a doppelg\u00e4nger. So much that when I was in college, my parents almost went up to here and asked why I came home for the weekend and didn't tell them. She looked like me. Tapped her foot a certain way. Was left handed. When my parents got closer they could see a few scars / birthmarks didn't match. But they called me bc itt freaked them out a little. My sister in law saw her. My then boyfriend saw her. No one told the others their stories.  Just told me. What if it had been a situation like that? Truly a complete stranger. Your sister should press charges. \n\nAlso, I agree with others - the woman thought it would be totally appropriate to yell at and he YOU in public. If your BF can't get his head wrapped around that and see why you are angry, you need to cut things off. It will get no better when you're married or when you have kids.

            "> I sure as hell don't think Jessi should go and apologize to her.\n\nWow, agreed. What would Jessi have to apologize for? If it's for calling her a crazy bitch, I think the fact that she was being grabbed and scolded by a stranger justifies her reaction. \n\nEven if it had been you and she caught you at a movie with another guy, that would not have warranted grabbing and slapping you. Especially with so many witnesses, I'd be highly tempted to go to the police about the assault.",
            "It's a deal breaker... But only for his mother. Make it clear that your sister is going to file a police report, because she should. She was assaulted by a stranger in a public place- why didn't Jessi call the police then?\n\nTell your boyfriend and his mom that until she apologizes to your sister, you refuse to be around her. She also needs to seek therapy- she thinks it's ok to assault someone because they're lying to her!",
            "Physical violence is only ever justified in self-defense and then refusing to apologize?  Fuck that. I think she's shown her true colors and I wouldn't have anything more to do with her regardless.\n\nWhat a horrid woman.",

            "Yup. Actions have consequences. ",
            "This is why Pride is seen as a flaw and a strength. She really should woman up and apologize. She can condition that apology with all sorts of \"I think if this was real I would be in the right...\" but she still has to do it. That's what being a grown up is. Admitting when you're wrong.",

            "Go with your sister and her BF (and anybody else who witnessed the assault and is willing to go) to the police and file a report and say you want to press charges. What she did was not only a complete overreaction, but criminally illegal. The fact that she won't apologize after realizing *her* error is puke inducing.\n\nAs for the relationship, that's really tough. It sounds like your BF is mostly on your side (right?). And he should be. If his mom is willing to assault people in public and not apologize profusely after being informed of her error, I wonder what kind of psychological and physical abuse he has endured. It's 100% reasonable to say you want no contact at all with his mother, let alone be okay with her delusion that's okay to assault a person she thought was you, and that you expect him to have your side and support you 100% on this if he wants to continue you the relationship.",
            "Yeah, this is mostly on your boyfriend.   His mom IS a crazy bitch, even if you were cheating thats not how you handle a situation.   The fact she was completely in the wrong?  narcissist.  \n\nHe needs to confront her and get her to admit her wrong and apologize.    If he is willing but she refuses. . . that does show he will stand up for you.  if he is unwilling to confront her then you should walk now. regardless of her crazy behavior, if he is so afraid or weak towards a family member that he wont back you, he isnt worth it.    \n\nI dont think you get an apology (not that you are asking, but since you are the one meeting her I am saying this) but she should show remorse and make amends with your sister.  they are never going to be friends but if there is any future. . . she needs to own up to her fuck up.  \n\nwhy would jessi apologize? she could possibly press charges given the mom's aggressive behavior to a perfect stranger.  ",
            "Your sister should have called the cops.  The woman's behavior was criminal.  Maybe she still can, if there are witnesses and bruises.\n\nThis isn't a dealbreaker *if BF is totally upset and shocked, and has your back*.  \n\nIf you stay with this person, realize that you could never let your children be alone with her.",
            "Even if it had been you and you were cheating, she still doesn't get to physically assault someone. She's 100% in the wrong and it sounds like she's overly involved in her son's life. I'm feeling a future subscriber to the justnomil subreddit.",

I would start looking at my SO as an extension of his crazy mom because if you commit to him then you commit to her too. \n\nI mean what if you got married someday. Will your twin sister and her attacker really be at the same table with no apology between them ? I'm sure your parents will forever hate your boyfriend and his family now, unless she apologizes. You gotta make your boyfriend see how serious this is. ",
            "That woman should feel pretty dang lucky the police didn't have her in the back of a car in cuffs.... Your sister is a saint for not seeking her arrest.... I don't think this is really an issue fairly between you and your BF if your BF is sticking up for you and your sister. He should also understand when/if you want to have nothing to do with her until she apologizes. I would NOT go visit and frankly, if your BF wants to be with you, he shouldn't either. His mother CRIMINALLY ASSAULTED his GF's sister and won't apologize. Come. on. If he is going to side with his mother... I'd dump him. ",
            "I'm a twin. My brother's my best friend and was best man at my wedding. I'm trying to wrap my head around a relationship with someone whose parent lays a finger on him, or just as importantly thinks there's an acceptable circumstance to lay a finger on me.",
            "Identical twin here. You are most definitely not overreacting. That behavior is inexcusable. If anyone acted that way to my twin sis I'd cut contact for sure. But id also encourage sister to file a police report. I'm not suggesting that you do this if you don't want to but just telling you that's how angry I'd be if someone attacked my sister on the street, regardless of a case of misidentification.\n\nThe fact she won't even apologize makes it worse, but it's already inexcusable behavior to begin with, even if she did apologize. You don't just start physically attacking someone on the street. ",
            "Firstly, that is battery.\n\nSecondly, that mother is gravely mistaken, but such a mistake can be understandable if you haven't taken the time to read legal scholars. \n\nJustified is not what the mother is, but she may be excused. In instances of valid excuse, apology is still appropriate though.",
            "Do not forget that she thought she was slapping you, and intended to physically assault you. The fact that it happened to your twin sister is tragic but mostly incidental. You should treat this as if you were assaulted. Your sister should press charges and you need to find out where your boyfriend stands on this issue and whether he'll support you against his violent mother.",
            "At this point, what would an apology even be worth? It won't mean she's actually sorry. Let it go, never speak to the woman again, and expect your boyfriend to honor your wish not to have contact with his psycho mom.",
            "I don't think you're over-reacting. She is. About damn near everything it appears. I'm very sorry, but it sounds like this woman is either high-strung or maybe unhappy and always on the edge of losing control of her emotions. She's also incredibly immature for an adult. It would have been over in an instant had she apologized right away for her mistake, and it was her mistake, not yours for not telling her.  I hope it is worked out. I would not go to her home this weekend for a visit. I dislike how often families pretend there is not issue with an individual just to keep the perception of peace. It enables them to continue their bad behavior.",
            "His mom is bat shit crazy. She should mind her own business. Even if you were cheating on him, she had no right to confront you (your twin-sister) like that an escalate  the situation. Instead she should have called your BF and told him to let him handle it. The fact that she was verbally and physically abusive made it worst. I would've kicekd her ass if I was your twin sister. ",
            "Even if that had been you and you *were* cheating, she would still owe you an apology for a slap across the face. Provided this was your sister, an innocent party, she doubly owes an apology.\n\nI sincerely hope your boyfriend continues to stand up to her and refuses to see her until she apologizes for her insane actions.",
            "No, the lack of apology is completely unacceptable. Fair enough, she was defending her son's albeit violently but she should apologise now that she knows better. If my mother did that to my gf, I wouldn't be speaking to her",

Make sure you go out of your way to say thank you for the invite to both of her parents. A card and flowers probably wouldn't hurt for her mother as well. Have fun!",
            "Just a note from the other side... I\u2019m not super rich, but I have a few friends with much less. \n\nI like to go to expensive restaurants, and occasionally share that with a friend who normally couldn\u2019t afford it on the regular. The thing is, it\u2019s really not a lot of money for me, so I\u2019m not making a huge sacrifice to pay his way. I just enjoy his company and like to see him enjoy the good cheese board! \n\nThe injustice of our income disparity makes me uncomfortable, much more than giving up a hundred bucks does.\n\nI guess I\u2019m trying to say, be grateful for being chosen to be included, but realize the scale of the financial gift may not be that large, to them. So don\u2019t hesitate to accept it. It\u2019s a good deal for everyone.\n\nThis is probably unnecessary advice, but don\u2019t draw attention to the price of things or how the price makes you feel \u2014 no \u201cOMG I can\u2019t believe this, it\u2019s AMAZING, wow I\u2019d never be here if not for you guys!\u201d Or \u201cA $15 margarita are you SERIOUS!!?\u201d Bringing up that disparity just leads to discomfort. \n\nBut enjoy it like the vacation it is! If it\u2019s the best margarita you\u2019ve ever had, say so. If the view from the hotel is gorgeous, say so... and let them vicariously enjoy treating you to something valuable\n\u2014 not valuable because it costs a lot, but valuable because you actually enjoy it, just like they do.",
            "Stop apologising for who you are and where you come from by thinking that you\u2019re not worthy of going on vacation or being a part of their lives. They invited you because they want you there, go have a great time with your girlfriend! If they thought less of you they wouldn\u2019t have invited you - don\u2019t apologise, just say thank you.\n\nEdit: spelling.",

It's probably true that their daughter will be a bit bored hanging out with her parents all day for a week. Also, they must enjoy your company. Just go.

I view money as hard to come buy, squeeze every penny, no waste, work hard. I know how quickly everything falls away from one small disaster. If my car failed, I couldn't eat for 2 days. \n\nMy bf however has always known comfort. He views money as a way to improve the lives of himself and the people around him. He has more than he needs for his physical wellbeing, so it makes him genuinely happy to use the rest of it to have a great time with his friends and family. He uses money to share the love. \n\nIt was a problem for me viewing money in this different way, and it's something I still struggle with because it's hard to break decades of programming, but know that these people are offering you this opportunity to travel because they have the means. They have the means to give you an amazing experience and they will love seeing you have a good time because they seem genuinely kind. They won't miss the money at all. They have more than enough for their physical wellbeing and it doesn't put them out. They are just sharing the love \u2764 \nThey also wouldn't offer of they didn't like you. Obviously they think you're pretty great so you are already fitting in more than you think",
            "Hey there! So I have two kids, 20 (daughter) and 18 (son). We're in a very similar situation, so I feel like I can offer some perspective. We're not wealthy, but we are white and my daughter's boyfriend, who is Venezuelan and unable to pay his own way, was invited to join us next week when we go on vacation. I also told my son he could bring a friend as he's not dating anyone at the moment. From the POV of a parent, you were invited because they like you and their daughter likes you. She's at an age where she's going to want someone her age to hang out with, do things the parents aren't into, etc and her parents want her to enjoy herself. I know that played a large role in my decision to tell my own kids they could bring someone.\n\nPaying your own way wasn't a condition they wanted to impose. Because they're generous, because they issued the invitation, and because you and she both are still \"kids.\" No one would expect you to be able to swing vacation on your own at your age (and back to my last point, it would be impolite to ask your parents to pay). Take some spending money for souvenirs, because that should come out of your own pocket, but otherwise, go and have fun. The fact that you're here asking this question means I probably don't need to say this next part, but the mom in me can't help it: be gracious and considerate of your hosts; say thank you; and wear sunscreen!",

My mom's a cab driver. \n\nI was super uncomfortable the first few times I met them for holidays and stuff. \n\nExcept I had no reason to be. They're all super kind. They don't care about what I do, or what my family does. They took me as a new part of their family - and they show a similar kindness to *my* family. \n\nIf they're assholes, they're assholes. But it has nothing to do with their wealth, and everything to do with them as humans. They're just people.",

They may have paid even if they knew you could afford it, because they are inviting you and they can afford it. I dated a guy in college whose family was much more wealthy than mine. I never expected anything from them. They would pay for my flights to visit during the summer sometimes and would typically cover all expenses while I was out there, but I was always humble, offered to pay for what I could afford, and enjoyed spending some time with my SO's family. If you see this relationship going anywhere I would absolutely go because this is a great time to bond with your future in laws.",

            "You're a teenager, so even though you work you wouldn't be expected to make as much money and afford the same things as someone well established in their career. It's super common for parents with the means to do so to pay for their kid's partner or friend to come on holiday with them. It's probably more for your girlfriend than for you, so she'll have someone to keep her company during the holiday and they can have some couple time.\n\nI can totally understand feeling guilty or uncomfortable, especially if you're hard-working and not the type of person to take hand-outs. Accept your feelings and try to see them for what they are: just feelings. Her parents have invited you because they see you make their daughter happy and they want her to have a good time. They also probably want to get to know you better. Maybe use the money you've saved and offer to take them out to dinner to show your gratitude?",

It's a little awkward to feel like you don't fit in but they seem to like you so try not to worry! It's good you've got some money of your own to spend while you're there, but otherwise (if you're not TOO uncomfortable) just thank them for their generosity and have a good time.",
            "Just go. They're that wealthy? An extra person on a weeklong vacation is not a burden on them. They're giving you an awesome gift because they clearly like you. You aren't a burden, I promise.",

You will miss out on a lot in life if you don\u2019t accept these opportunities.\n\nThey will be disappointed not to have you there. It will be a more negative experience for them to have you decline. (They will experience zero negativity if you do go!)\n\nIt\u2019s an investment in your relationship with them as well. Your time is valuable, whether or not you have financial wealth.",
            "They aren't trying to make you feel awkward, they invited you to join them on vacation, they accept you.  It might be humbling to be around that kind of wealth but don't let it discourage you or make you feel bad.  Parents, rich or poor want to do nice things for their children and both have the right to make gestures and provide a nice experience for those around them they care for.  \n\nBe gracious, be humble, thank them and just enjoy the experience, they aren't trying to shame you, rub your face in it, make you feel isolated or unworthy.  Money discrepancies don't need to be severe for feelings like what you've expressed to arise, adults making the same money fight at the end of meal over who pays the check all the time.",

She and her parents seem to see that you are a hardworking individual worthy of great respect. Go and have fun!",
            "Go! Go! Go! Her parents know you are not paying your own way. No one would expect a 17 year old to be able to pay for a vacation at a resort. They invited you because they like you and know their daughter will enjoy having a friend to hang out with. Lots of families invite friends along for vacations. Go. Have fun. Don't worry about paying for stuff. If they invited you they fully expect to pay for it all.\n\nJust be gracious and thank them. Ask your gf ahead of time what the sleeping arrangements are so you don't have any awkward moments.",
            "Go, have some money set aside to pay for stuff while you're there. Super expensive dinner? Order something that you can afford and always offer to pay for your own, they will (I almost promise you) stop you from paying for yourself, but its the effort that counts. If there is something you want to buy/pay for, do so. They paid for the resort which means they budgetted for ALL your expenses, but you shouldn't take advantage of that.\n\nIT sounds like you are very respectful and they recognize and appreciate that. Take them aside (without your girlfriend) at some opportunity and thank them individually for inviting you along. I would also buy them a gift, something small and thoughtful to express your gratitude, even if its a small bottle of gentleman's jack for dad and a bottle of wine for mom, or whatever alcohol they like, is usually a safe bet. (I know you're 17, have your parents buy it if you must). Otherwise, a nice vase/flowers, or whatever, just something small to say thank you. They clearly like you and they'll appreciate the gesture I'm sure.\n\nDon't miss out on opportunities. Growing up I was the poor kid with rich friends, and their families always brought me along to big events. I was kind, appreciative, and well-mannered. I always assumed everything would be paid for (it always was) but I never ordered outside my own means in order to be respectful. You got this man, don't stress.",
            "Not that I'm particularly well off, but I make a lot more money than some of my friends and I pay for them so that they're able to go out with me all the time. I want their company, and I don't mind spending some of my money to make it happen.\n\nThat might not be the perfect analogy, but if they're willing to pay for you to go on this vacation, that means they like your company. Trust me, the money they're spending on you is nothing to them, they won't even think twice about it.\n\nIf you decline going with them, you run the risk of 1. offending them (maybe they'll think you don't like being around them?) or 2. coming off as insecure around wealth. That second point isn't TOO bad, and since your girlfriend's parents seem like down-to-earth, understanding people, they'll probably be okay, but you'd come off as better to them if you don't look like you're super insecure about money.\n\nGo on the vacation, be respectful, maybe offer to treat them out to a lunch on one of the days, and then after the vacation is over, just reiterate that you were very thankful and that you greatly enjoyed their company.\n\nFor reference, I also grew up quite low income and had a high school girlfriend who was very well off. I then went to one of the most expensive private universities in America, and for my first 2-3 years of college, my insecurity of the wealth discrepancies between myself and my friends/peers was one of the most difficult thing to overcome, so I kind of understand where your head is at. Don't sweat it bro. Enjoy your time with them.",
            "Just get a gift that is within your means of spending.    \nA nice bouquet of flowers for the mom.\nAnd maybe for the father something he would normally not buy for himself, like chocolate filled with hard liquor or something.     \nMaybe if he is a reader a book with a personal thank you note from you in the first page.\n\n\nIt's something they probably don't recieve often and is thus more fun for them as well, and you don't have to break the bank.\n       \n\nOr maybe if they like doing games on holiday buy a recent edition of 30 seconds or something",
            "I completely get where you are coming from. I come from a working-class family and my husband comes from a wealthy upper middle class/ lower upper-class family. Their wealth sounds very similar to your girlfriend's family. I've learned to just accept the things they offer and always say thank you (but it was very difficult at first as I felt I didn't deserve anything they offered). It sounds like they consider you part of the family and wouldn't want you to be left out on a fun family trip just because of money. To my In-laws spending that kind of money doesn't seem to phase them like it does me, I bet it's the same for your GF's family. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it helps you feel better just get them a nice bottle of wine or other gift around $50 if you can afford it as a thank you. Getting them small stuff like that helps curb my own embarrassment when situations like this arise. My husband has told me that his parent's don't offer things like that to be petty, it's because they want everyone to be included. I'm sure it's the same thing for them. I would definitely go though, I think it would hurt their feelings if you declined to go. There's also no need to apologize here, you've done nothing wrong, as long as you don't act entitled there is no reason to feel bad. How you feel about being offered something like this is a product of the environment you were raised in, it sounds like neither of our families could do extravagant things like take trips together growing up. This is likely completely normal for them. Good luck, feel free to ask me anything else directly as I feel we can really relate on this topic lol",
            "I think they respect you, and recognize that you are a hard worker. They seem down to earth and I bet  genuinely see your good character.  Keep being the hard working man you were raised to be, and keep treating their daughter like the princess you see her as. Honest, loving and sincere parents don\u2019t look for wealth, politics, or a high social background, they look for a person who loves their kid and would do anything to give them the world. The money you saved\u2014-insist that one night of the trip you treat them all to dinner. Sit down with her dad, man to man, and express your concerns, your respect, and your goals as far as the relationship is concerned. They seem like good people and you seem like an honest hard working guy, they are lucky to have you in their life.",

            "The best way to fit in is to go on the trip with them. Absolutely go. If you don't know how to act or do something on the trip just ask them. They know you're a kid, its okay to not know everything.",
            "I'd see it as them doing their daughter a solid involving her boyfriend.

If things go south on the holiday, you need somwine who can fly you back and pick you up.\n\nMy parents aren't rich in any way, but they've taken all my previous boyfriends with us to vacation houses in the past. It's just a gift to their daughter to keep her occupied.",
            "This sounds like it is about them wanting to make you feel like part of their family, so if you decline for any reason that is  not  extremely important,  it will come off as you not wanting to be a part of their family.",

They honestly wanted him to come and the trips were more fun with him there! Don\u2019t feel bad. I\u2019m sure her parents are more than happy to have you and paying your way is barely a drop in the bucket for them.",

He is now away for a month because he's mother hates me and I'm bot welcome in his family. You can maybe buy a small present there to say thank you to them .",
            "You have been manipulated by the culture you live in to believe that your wealth is tied to your worthiness. If your GF's family wants your company, it's because their daughter cares about you.

Write them a nice thank you card after you come back. \n\nSeriously though, they paid for you to come because they want you there. It's that simple. You have nothing to apologize for. I don't know any 17 year olds who can pay for their own resort vacation.",
            "Dude! Her parents like you enough to invite you on vacation. This isn\u2019t about THEM thinking you aren\u2019t good enough, it\u2019s about YOU thinking you\u2019re not good enough! And give that noise, you\u2019re plenty good enough! \n\nMoney is nice to have, but it dies not mean that people have more class, are more intelligent, have more character, or are better in any way.

And it seems like they like you around. \n\nBe appreciative and, if you can, maybe offer to treat everyone to dessert or coffee one of the days.

            "I'm in a similar situation. Don't overthink it. Go. Get to know the family in new ways and see the world. Don't feel guilty. It's likely that you coming along didn't cost them much extra outside of potentially a plane ticket, which may not be much in comparison to their income. \n\nIf things progress with her, you have to learn how to interact with her family even if you feel different.

However my financial situation changed now and we\u2019re not poor anymore, but just barely middle class (if that tbh). Anyway. At first I felt like you. She would invite me to such places where I was worried my clothes wouldn\u2019t be good enough much less me. Her family\u2019s night out was something my family would have a heart attack over spending. I am Latino as well and she was white. \n\nI had some issues trying to accommodate. However I was open with my girlfriend about this. She knew I grew up poor and she had also let her parents know that about me when we first started dating. They were fine with it because of the person I am now. \n\nYou said that you saved a couple hundred dollars. That\u2019s good. Use it to buy little things.I would accept the offer and enjoy your time. Just be on your best behavior but don\u2019t be overly great full. Be grateful by all means but after saying thank you twice don\u2019t keep saying it. It does become a bit of a turn off. Go make memories as I\u2019m sure your girlfriend wants them , and her parents seem to be okay with bringing you. \n\nJust act your best, and enjoy it. Say thank you but don\u2019t push it. And cover what you can on your own, but don\u2019t deny them paying for you as it\u2019s probably a ya for them to show you that they like you and they may get mad.",
            "Learning how to accept gifts that make you uncomfortable is a part of being an adult. Whether the gift is an ugly sweater in the wrong size that your grandmother swears looks amazing on you, or hundreds - thousands of dollar gifts in the form of a vacation with your girlfriend's family. I think ultimately it's not about YOU, it's her family signaling to her that they accept you as improving her life and making her happy. They want to show that to her by bringing you. You're allowed to refuse gifts, but generally speaking, in a situation like this, you'd only be refusing a gift largely to make yourself feel comfortable, not because you're afraid it would hurt her and her parents (which would be a good reason to attempt to refuse a gift).\n\nI'd recommend go on the trip. It will make your girlfriend happy, and I doubt you'll hate it.",
            "Yeah man, it's good that you feel the way you do.  It means you are a good person and don't want to be perceived a freeloader or that you only want their daughter for the access to perks.  \n\nJust be very thankful for everything they do and never assume a thank you isn't necessary.

When the trip is over, write them a sincere thank you note telling them how much you enjoyed the trip and thank them for their hospitality and get them a small but meaningful gift - a good bottle of wine, a nice plant or something you know they would enjoy. It doesn\u2019t have to be and shouldn\u2019t be extravagant, just thoughtful.  Relax and have fun.",

But if you do decide to turn it down, certainly don't do that without speaking to your gf first. You (presumably) wouldn't turn down other gifts for her on her behalf without first checking with her, so don't do that here either.\n\nAnd I know this will come across as condescending, but I'll say it anyway. You're overthinking. It's incredibly sweet that you're overthinking, but that's still what you're doing. It doesn't sound as though you're worried that spending this money on you would put your gf's parents into any financial difficulty, and it doesn't sound as though you're worried that they've somehow been manipulated into doing this. It sounds like your position on this is that they're nice people trying to do a nice thing. When that happens - let the people be nice :).",

I have been in your shoes and asked myself the same awkward questions (for me it was a skiing trip!). I would take them at their word and believe the best intentions. \n\nDo something nice like maybe drinks or dinner while you're there?

            "My parents have a bit of money as well (they're not your girlfriends parents rich I think, but they never had any money problems whatsoever) so I have kindof been in a similar situation on a smaller scale, but I was your girlfriend in that case. My boyfriend at the time came out of a difficult family living situation. His dad died when he and his three siblings were very young, so it was just them and their mom and she was struggling really hard to even feed them some days I think. We were teenagers at the time,his youngest siblings were around 8 I would say. So when I got together with the guy my parents were really open to me dating him and especially when they got to know him they were all heart eyes for him. He was just like you, a great guy, hardworking (he supported his mom in paying the bills a lot), wanted to make something out of his life in spite of none of his family ever doing so. My parents bought him tons of stuff, especially clothes and stuff he would never treat himself to just because money was tight. And he was sometimes feeling real bad about it, too. And I can tell you a thing: if your girlfriends family didn't want you to come they wouldn't have asked you to go. They respect you, the way you look at life and the way you're treating their daughter. They are glad she found a good guy like you. I think you should go on the trip with them. As you said, you can pay some things there (if they let you my parents  always had a thing about that too, never let him pay anything, but in hindsight it was so cute of them to do this even if the relationship didnt last)",

They have taken him all over on vacations to Canada, the US, China and many other trips within Europe, and they pay for everything. While I can understand being hesitant about taking handouts, I would say enjoy their generosity and go on the trip. I would actually think they would feel bad if you didn\u2019t go.",

After we had been  dating for about a year I was invited to go on a trip my family or myself would have never been able to afford. I tried to come up with every reason why I should say no, but it turned out great. I had a great time and got to bond with the whole family.

They want to share their more with you and it sounds pretty judgement free because there's an understanding that you're young and don't have a lot of extra cash.  \n\nI would strongly suggest accepting the vacation.

Their daughter, my gf's sister, had a destination wedding in Costa Rica. Her parents paid for essentially 99% of my expenses including the flight, the room, etc. Easily a few thousand dollars worth. I definitely felt awkward about it at first, but I'm so glad I went. My outward gratitude to them for it was payment enough as they told me.

I have friends who don't have so much money so when I invite them out for lunch or whatever, I'll get the food or whatever because I want their company and to see them. But they don't owe me anything. It will be the same for them, they know the situation that's why they want to do this for you. Just be polite and make sure you show your appreciation and that's all i imagine they would expect. You make their daughter happy so that makes them happy. It sounds shitty but it's probably not a lot of momey for them and they sound like generous people. I have family that have been successful in business and are the same. Just get them a gift like a bottle of wine or something else just to show that you appreciate it.

            "Go with them. I've also had opportunities to go on similar trips with friends' parents. My suggestion is to go and to keep yourself on your own budget. If they offer \"oh, get whatever you like,\" really do exactly that. In my experience if you're polite, kind, enthusiastic and appreciative they really don't mind shelling out a few extra bucks. My most recent experience was dinner with a friend of my father's and he gave the old \"get whatever you like\" and while my mother didn't even get to offer (normally she jumps on these things, willing to go halvsies, or pay in), he picked up the whole bill. I know he enjoyed himself, as much as we did - he showed us his home, his village, his favourite pub, and we loved it.\n\nFor rich people, sometimes paying for things is just part of the system, like locking your door, or taking your shoes off. My brother, when we needed to use a chip-card for the UK rail system, just dolled out his and told me to \"hang on to it until the end of the trip\". It's just something that happens. They're not oblivious to \"our plight\" which is why they went out of the way to say \"we've already paid, you can't say no\". They want you there. \n\nEnjoy your trip!!! Please. It's experience you'll never forget or regret!",

They know that as a normal teenager it would be pretty steep for you to pay on your own so they did it for you, that\u2019s all. Also rich people, especially people born into it, can be really weird because they don\u2019t need to work. There\u2019s no one specific way that wealthy people act. They came into their money one way or another but all the social customs are the same as your average joe. And you might fit in a bit better than someone who comes from money because you\u2019ve got a nice work ethic and you come from a normal family. Rich kids can be a bit entitled some times so someone that could easily afford this trip might be a bit more annoying as a part of the group. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is that to them, this is really normal and they\u2019ve probably had friends of their kids join them on trips for decades. And that there\u2019s no right way to fit in with rich people compared to everyone else.

Maybe not as much of a difference as you describe, but it was tough getting over it.  \n\nHere's the thing you need to understand.  Your girlfriend is with YOU because she loves YOU. Her parents dont appear to be actively trying to separate you, or not include you in things.  They could have easily said \"we're taking your GF on a vacation, she wont be around for a little while\".  Instead they paid for everything without even consulting you.

Act like it.\n\nfifth: as far as helping you out with school goes? They need you to be able to fully support their little princess in the lifestyle she is used to. That means being a high earner, which means a GOOD (ie. expensive) school. They are making sure that a potential son-in-law is an asset to the family, not a drag.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know (from experience) how awkward this is gonna feel. Just do your best to relax. Talk to the lucky lady about how you feel, and that you feel really out of place a lot of the time. She can help just by holding your hand, and explaining EVERYTHING. Make her feel like it is ok to tell you all about the things she takes for granted, and don't assume you know or like you will assume she is talking down to you. You won't.

My partner comes from a working class immigrant family. My parents are super generous, always wanting to help others out, including their children. Sounds amazing.\n\nExcept it wasnt until I met my partner that I understood something really important. I was all wrapped up in guilt around everything with them. When me and my partner decided to start a family, I would constantly be mentioning \"oh but my parents this and that\" and it became clear that all that help I've gotten my whole life was in my head as \"I owe them\" and while they will never say that out loud, they feel the same way. I dont owe them money, but I owe them unending gratitude that comes as the price of my independence. Every decision I make has to include them in it. Not anymore, because I have financially cut myself off from them for years now and only ask for childcare when it is necessary and convenient for them. Our whole dynamic has changed for the better because of this.\n\nMy partner has never accepted anything from them that wasnt a gift at Christmas or birthday or whatever. When they offered to help pay for baby things or buy us a car or supplement part of our rent, we said no. It was unnatural for me at first, but I've learned to say no naturally through him. And thank God I have. Now we dont live in luxury but we know how to work hard and get what we need through our own blood sweat and tears.\n\nThis sounds like its unrelated to what you're asking but I had to share that back story because my partner's  brother (16) recently was invited on an all expenses paid vacation by his rich white gf. My partner told him \"you can go, but only if you can pay half your way\" because he knows that rich white generosity always comes at a price. It's ok to accept generosity at times, but always do your best to show that you are capable of being independent. Never let them think you need them. Even the nicest, most liberal white people suffer from some degree of a superiority complex.\n\nIf everything you wrote is the whole 100% true picture, then go, and everyone's advice is pretty solid.

It means they like you. \nGo on the first vacation and see how you feel. \nOf course, use your money for souvenirs. Maybe bring your girlfriend a gift on the trip and give it to her as a thank you for wanting to have these experiences together.",
            "Often a same situation for me. I am often taken on trips I know I could never afford in a lifetime thanks to my wife's family. When we were younger I had the same feelings as you about these trips. I felt guilt, like I was a burden. I expressed this with my now father-in-law and he told me, \"the only reason I work so hard is so that I can treat the people I care for well. Don't feel guilty, cause that would mean I'm wasting my life away at work.\"\n\nThey want to take you cause they want you there. Don't sweat it homie. I usually do something for them in the future to make up for it. Nothing big, can be a card, or cook them a meal.",
            "As someone who has experienced this, just go and be thankful! They are doing this because they like you.\n\nAlso, be sure to get them a thank you card/small gift at the end of the trip. This small gesture is really appreciated and should be given on the last day.\n\nI gave my boyfriend's family a framed, embroidered family portrait as a \"holiday\" / thank you for the international trip they took me on. They really liked it and sentimental things like that will be appreciated by people who can buy anything that they want.",
            "Try not to beat yourself up about coming from a poor family.  Your girlfriend obviously doesn't care or she wouldn't be with you.  Her parents paid for you not because they just have money, they like you, and think you are good for their daughter, or they would have voiced their concerns a long time ago.  Be happy, say thanks, and enjoy your time be abroad with your girlfriend.  You seem like a honest, hard working fella, who has a good head on his shoulders.  That's what I feel her parents thinks too.",
            "Poor people value money. Rich people value time.  You give them your time and labor, which they think highly of.  Taking a step back, you're two years younger and still have your shit together enough that her parents want you around so much they've bought your seat without even asking.  \n\nYou're valued by them.  You clearly make their lives better.  Accept that they see you as good for their daughter.  Accept their help when they offer, and hi just keep being good to her and helpful to them.",
            "You don't need to worry about being a burden. This is a family event, and they want to you to come so much that they will happily pay for you. Sounds to me like they already consider you part of the family. But, if it makes you that uncomfortable then just tell them",
            "They wouldn't invite you if they didn't mean it it. I'm from a working class family and my parents would on occasion invite friends of mine on vacation and I also got invited to go with my friends. Just say thank you and have fun.",
            "Take the free vacation and have fun!!",
            "Hi! I\u2019ve basically got that same situation but the other way around. \n\nMy (18f) family is very wealthy and we can afford to visit family in japan from the UK every year. My boyfriend (20m) and his family are in not as good of an economical standpoint as us, eg he requires the highest bursary to attend university. He is coming with us to japan this year, actually he\u2019s arriving in a few days, to spend the month with me and my family. \n\nObviously, he was able to pay for the flight, but my parents booked hotels for him, and my parents will also be paying for all the food expenses, provided that we attend with them rather than making dinner plans for just ourselves and without my parents. \n\nI have also been with my bf for a year and needless to say I am completely in love with him, and my parents are well aware of that. I\u2019m sure your girlfriend\u2019s parents are aware that you care about her a lot too, and that they\u2019ve decided to take you on this trip to make their daughter happy and to allow you to spend some time together without you having to worry about your expenditure. Obviously the latter hasn\u2019t gone completely to plan (but then again, when does it), but the best advice I can give you is to take up the offer! This could be the experience of your life with her, and rather than worrying about what a burden you may be (which I completely false) think you should be happy that this opportunity has been given to you (not to say that you aren\u2019t already). \n\nI hope you have fun on that trip man. Sending you my best wishes!",
            "Just go. People with money spend it on the people they care about, it's a new thing for you but it's not something to feel bad about. Do something nice for them that isn't about money as a thank you. Just go and enjoy the time together.",
            "Wait, you're afraid you wouldn't fit in, or you're too proud to accept a generous gift?\n\nPlease clarify, OP.",
            "Take every opportunity to experience what you can in life, you will regret not going later. Sounds like a good time, have fun man don\u2019t worry about it so much you sound like a good kid.",
            "I totally understand how you feel, my boyfriend's family are quite rich and I never had any money when we first started dating, but they payed for everything for me. if they went to their holiday home, they took me, if they went to a fancy restaurant, they invited me, they even payed for me to go to France, my first holiday abroad! I've had so many experiences thanks to them, that I would never have had, and they just do it because they love me and want me to be part of their family. I could cry just thinking about how nice it is\n\n it's hard not to feel bad, but there is no reason to, they just really want you there, and you should totally just go and have a great time! Do some bonding with her parents and make sure you let them know how grateful you are, but they want you there and there's no need to apologize! Enjoy yourself!",
            "They invited you, friend. That means they want you there. Further, the parents themselves asked you. That means they genuinely want you to go! Go and enjoy your time! Stop overthinking it you know? You\u2019re going to have a blast :)\n\nSmall piece of advice: Just be respectful once there and do whatever everyone else wants to do and don\u2019t push your own agenda/itinerary. I\u2019ve learned that the hard way. If you\u2019re being taken on a vacation, do it their way, not yours.",
            "They invited you because they like you and want to share this experience with you. For them, the money for the ticket was probably no big deal",
            "Ok definitely go! Maybe talk about your concerns with your gf prior to going. Just be as helpful and as engaging as you can. Seriously that\u2019s what parents like to see the most. \n\nWill their be young kids there? Play with them and make them love you. \n\nIf it wasn\u2019t a resort I\u2019d say buy donuts and coffee one morning but that\u2019s prob covered. \n\nTake some good pics of the family and after vacation send a thank you letter with pictures.",
            "Definitely go! They invited you, so accept the invite and enjoy the trip! I'm was in a similar boat. My boyfriend's family is very wealthy (I am not) and they invited me to go to Barcelona with them. I was shocked, my family couldn't believe it, and I felt weird about accepting an offer to such an amazing trip. But I did and I'm glad I did. We had an amazing time. I would recommend a thank you card and a gift (I gave them a gift certificate to their favorite restaurant). Be polite and have fun!",
            "People who aren't as rich as your girlfriend's family do this too. My husband's family did this type of stuff on a lesser scale for me when we were dating.  And believe me,  they wouldn't even have me around the house or on the vacation with them if they didn't like me.  Graciously accept and enjoy the time with them.",
            "They made the offer, you should absolutely go and enjoy yourself. What's even better is that you've saved up some cash from work. I promise you picking up a dinner tab or just being able to be independent on your own merit once there will impress them. It shows you aren't abusing their good will and you work hard for things you want. It sounds like they really like you, their daughter obviously loves you quite a lot, there's no reason to feel like you don't fit in or are undeserving. They see a ton of potential in you and want you to do great things. There's nothing wrong with a small helping hand, it's up to you to do the hard bits. \n\n\nI hope you have a great vacation and best of luck in college",
            "Better believe it and rise up to it or you risk losing the gf.",
            "Be yourself , take the ride",
            "When I was 17 my bfs family paid for me to go on holiday with them. As with you, I wasn't very rich and they were doing pretty well for themselves. I went and had an amazing time with them. It's not all about money and clearly they believe that too else 1. They wouldn't have offered and 2. Wouldn't want you dating their daughter in the first place. \nStop worrying and enjoy a family vacation!",
            "Just go they . Been there. They just want to be nice as they accept you for who you are. They want to be accepting of you so be accepting of them. They probably love to show you a good time.",
            "Don't be ashamed. They are probably grateful that you are teaching their daughter to be thankful and how important hard work is, things they can't buy for her.  Be respectful and probably stay sober.  It's so fun to bring someone to something they normally can't afford too so they are going to enjoy having you as well.",
            "Go and have a good time.",
            "They invited you, that alone is enough",
            "If it's not too much of a stretch money wise then go for it. If they offer to pay for something it's because they're comfortable offering it, it may feel awkward but it's really not as bad as it seems. The fact that they invited you to dinner to ask if you want to come is a huge sign of respect on their part. If you're nervous about fitting in just act the way you do around them normally. Also don't forget when you have multiple forks and spoons just start on the outside and work your way in",
            "Don't worry about it! I'm sure it was weird for her too when she started doing that kind of stuff. Roll with it and eventually you'll feel like you belong :) \n\nLife's only as awkward as you make it.",
            "You are young. When you are older and have money it can just solve problems that inconvenience you or annoy you etc. You not coming on the vacation would make everyone upset and they would enjoy it less. BOOM. Their money can easily solve that problem. Go and enjoy yourself. Make sure to thank them at the beginning and end.",
            "Agree with everyone who says you're overthinking. Your family's poverty has nothing to do with it. I hope you don't take offense to this, but you're just a kid!! No reasonable person would expect a 17-year-old to fork up money for a resort vacation. If they invite you to come with, that obviously means paying for your ticket/room. \n\nYour gf's parents want you around! They sound like decent people who just want the best for their daughter, and they see you as part of that picture!! You should feel good about yourself for that, not embarrassed!",
            "Been in your situation many many times. They want you to go, and they will welcome you. Tell your girlfriend how you're feeling in terms of nerves etc and I'm sure she'll help put you at ease. Thank the parents with a card, maybe a box of chocolates or something too? And enjoy!!",
            "Hope this doesn\u2019t get lost in the messages.\n\nI\u2019ve seen this from the other side of the coin. My BIL is very different from the rest of our family, he\u2019s much more of a country boy and probably didn\u2019t grow up with the same things me and my sister did. He teases her about \u201c growing up with a silver spoon\u201d.\n\nAnyway when ever we get together as a family my father will cover anything and everything. Not because he feels he needs to but because he wants to and I\u2019ll tell you why. My BIL is family and treats him like he does all of us  and two he\u2019s the guy my sister picked. My father wants to get to know him and be part of their life. And if paying helps them do things together that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to do.\n\nAll my BIL does is say thank you. I recommend that\u2019s all you do too.\n\nTake this time to get to know the family even more and enjoy yourself .  \n\nShare your hobby\u2019s and  you may find something y\u2019all mutually like that you didn\u2019t know about.\n\nNot sure how serious your relationship is but I assume if you are joining the family vacation it\u2019s gotta be some what serious, you may one day be family!\n\nGood luck and have fun!",
            "Dude with that kind of expense its because they WANT you there.They want you in their family and for you to make their kid happy. go for it ;)",
            "If i were you I would go with them and have  a nice time. I would buy them a decent bottle of red wine ($20-$30) and write them a nice card. Bring the wine and the card and give it to them the day you arrive on vacation.  I know you are 17, but I am sure a family member can do you a solid help you buy it.",
            "I married someone who has a wealthy family too but they don't flaunt their wealth. Honestly just be yourself, be a good guy and try your best - things will workout and sounds like you have a supportive set of future inlaws, don't feel bad. My family is lower middle class and I grew up some what poor too, like you.",
            "It probably has a lot to do with the Latin culture and upbringing vs. American. Half Latino here so I understand navigating both worlds. It makes you want to reciprocate the gesture in kind (Latin culture) but you simply can\u2019t at this point in your life. Turning it down to save face isn\u2019t the way to go on this. You\u2019ll be borderline insulting her parents by doing so (American/rich people culture) and missing out on a great experience and chance to broaden your own horizons. You\u2019ll also learn how to fit in and get accustomed to people of a different economic strata (useful skill) which if you continue dating seems you\u2019ll need to understand and learn to get comfortable with. Do you only want to be around People of a similar background your entire life? That\u2019s extremely limiting in my opinion.\n\nAs someone that has been dirt poor (and well off) and has had friends from every kind of background it\u2019s fun to be able to navigate both worlds with ease. Not being a snob hanging out with your poor friends and family in the ghetto (probably more fun sometimes) while feeling at ease at dinner at Michelin star restaurant or in an exclusive hotel or resort with a different crowd tends to make you more endearing to both groups. Plus it keeps life interesting.\n\nAbsolutely GO! And enjoy it. Be thrilled her parents are this welcoming to you. They seem like good people. Everyone gave you good advice on here about how to act. Follow it and GO!",
            "My family is not super rich. If they invited my girlfriend on a trip they would insist on paying for travel, accommodations and food. I think most people feel like that is a given when extending the invitation to a minor.",

            "I\u2019ve been in your girlfriend\u2019s shoes. My parents invited my high school boyfriend to come on holiday with us. There\u2019s no reason to feel bad at all and don\u2019t worry about paying for anything. They seem to like you and they have enough money for it to not make a difference for you to come along. They are doing this for their daughter because they know she\u2019ll be much happier being on holiday with them if you are there as well. If I can give you a piece of advice: bring them a token of appreciation like a nice bottle of wine or something. Nothing majorly expensive just a gesture. My parents still talk about the boyfriend that brought them a nice gift. They don\u2019t expect someone your age to pay for something expensive like a holiday yourself. It\u2019s absolutely fine. They will be happy to have you there otherwise they wouldn\u2019t offer. It will make their daughter happy and hopefully you\u2019ll all have a good time! \n\nMy parents always invited my boyfriends along to everything and still do. They see it as part of inviting me and are also happy to get to know my partners better.",
            "They would not have invited/included you if they did not like you .Perhaps they want to get to know you better. Obviously their daughter likes you and for some people that is enough of a recommendation.\n\nI'm my experience (growing up poor)many people who have wealth want to give onto others. And most of the time its not in a pitying manner, they want to share or enable you to experience something you wouldn't be able to otherwise.\n\nUltimately it's your decision however if you do decline , try to find other opportunities to get to know one another. It sounds like they raised your girlfriend right the campy terrible* people .\n\n\n*that was supposed to be far less insulting and read \"they can't be terrible-\"",
            "That's really sweet. As a daughter, it means a lot that they want you to go. They clearly see a lot in you. The money for the trip is probably a little less important to them. They want you along! Just make sure you show your appreciation. It seems to me they're just starting to see you as part of the family, it's sweet. Definitely go.",
            "I sorta relate with this post. My bfs parents live in like a 4mil house in Los Gatos and I didnt grow up that way and I'm part mexican like yourself, but it took me a while to not feel anxious about the whole money difference after a while you realize that they are the same. And it dosent make me feel to weird now because if he likes me he likes me. Money shouldnt come between that. And I bet the parents want you to enjoy yourself.",
            "We aren't rich, and I would definitely pay for my daughter's boyfriend or a friend to go on vacation with us. It seems like they wouldn't invite you unless they were willing to foot the bill for an expensive trip. I think you should go and have fun!",
            "Go on the trip, stop overthinking it. \n\nThey do fine and they\u2019re trying to make their daughter happy, obviously they think you\u2019re a solid catch. \n\nNot going would be more of an insult tbh. \n\nHave fun!",
            "They want you to go because they like you. Your girlfriend and family sounds sweet and also down to Earth. They know you don't have the money but they like you so much they want your company. Money is relative. To most people that is a large expense but to them it is not. I'd accept the gift/opportunity.",
            "A plane flight and extra bed in a resort is nothing to people that have a two million dollar house. I go on vacation all the time and im broke as hell, it's not as expensive as you think. Refusing their offer would be more rude than the \"burden\" you're imagining yourself to be. Just go.",
            "You're a sweet kid,  they like you.  Just be yourself and have fun!",
            "You should look at it as a great sign that they want to foster your relationship with their daughter. You saved money to spend, go have a great time. And obviously, thank her parents.",
            "I was in your boat 24 years ago. They took me skiing, to their vacation house, to the beach, to wilderness adventures. I didn't have $50 in my pocket for some trips. I treated there daughter like a queen though. Held every door, listened and respected her. We've been married 15 years. You might not marry her but her parents would rather see you be a gentleman and treat their daughter well than you be able to afford your own travel.",
            "If they didn't like you, they wouldn't have invited you, simple as that :)",
            "Go! Her family is clearly not hurting for money, and it's no skin off their teeth to pay for one more person to be on vacation with them. You're the serious boyfriend of a family member, so they're treating you like you're family yourself. This is a gift, not a debt. If you ever aren't sure how to conduct yourself at some point in the trip, ask your girlfriend and she'll probably be able to help. Be realistic about the fact that there's no guarantee she and you will be together forever (I'm not being critical of you by saying this, but I do notice that you're 17 years old!), so live for the moment and spend time with this person you love.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to show your appreciation you can give them a gift, too, but don't try to match this gift in value or extravagance - your gift is going to be a gesture of politeness and appreciation, not a repayment. Ask your girlfriend for advice on this - you want your gift to be something they would like, and something you can afford. If you were older, I would recommend a nice bottle of champagne or other alcohol, but you're 17. You're young enough that merely sending any gift is going to look like going the extra mile. One possibility would be to get your GF's recommendation on a florist and give them a nice arrangement plus a card where you write a message - express genuine thanks for being welcomed into the family, but there's no need for it to be obsequious or insincerely gushing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso keep in mind that your different cultural background from her and her family is valuable and makes you worldly. If you continue to travel with her and her family, it's likely at some point your presence and knowledge will be a valuable asset - i.e. recommending food items, determining whether an artisan product is authentic or high-quality. You're clearly smart, enterprising, and going places, don't sell yourself short.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd keep in mind that in future, knowing a well-established family can be a huuuuuuuuge benefit in finding internships or career-focused summer job opportunities when in college. Like, it's accepted as normal among people like GF and her parents' friends kids that finding jobs through your parents' social circle is just A Thing You Do, it isn't a burden or impolite. Once you figure out your career trajectory and are working toward it in college, don't be shy about looping GF and her family into your hunts for internships or summer jobs over your college career. Not \"Hey can you get me a job in X?\" calls in the middle of the day, but \"I'm now majoring in X and applying for internship-level jobs for this April to August\" offered as part of regular conversation when you have dinner with her and the fam. I bet you at least her family will be able to give you valuable advice, but there's a reasonable chance they'll say \"Oh, I know So-And-So at Company Y, they're looking to hire interns who are studying X, I'll connect you with them.\" In this case, the best way to be appreciative is to take the opportunity and do stellar work for So-And-So's company.",
            "Ok I feel your pain been there. It sucks to be poor and sucks even harder when you're in this kinda situation. However someone told me this and I have never forgotten it. Sometimes when people have the money, you know they have the money and they are offering it sucks to have the person your trying to help or give a gift to decline it. If you had money would you be a giving person? I would I know I would because I'm giving now and I'm poor. I LOVE giving feels better than getting most times. They offered, they want you there. Just be the awesome person you must be to be invited in the first place. Yes do something nice to say thank you. I like the slideshow idea.",
            "You say thank you and go! \n\nBe grateful - but not obnoxiously so - and have a great time! Don't worry about the money, but take lots of pictures and share stories with the family.",
            "Please please don't feel like a burden! \n\nMy husband and I are *somewhat* similar to you and your gf. My parents are wealthy and my husband comes from a working/middle class family. Not as extreme it sounds like, but the dynamic is similar. \n\nI promise no one sees you in a negative way at all. My parents paid for many experiences for my husband when we were dating not because they felt like they had to, but because they genuinely enjoyed his company and how happy he made me. They truly wanted to spend time with him and wanted him to go do cool stuff with us too. Even now that we're married, my parents still offer to do stuff like get the check at dinner. In a few days we're actually going on vacation and my parents got an Airbnb with an extra bedroom so my husband and I could afford to come (rightfully, the money didn't come with me when I moved out-we're young and broke-ish). \n\nI guarantee they see how happy you make their daughter and just want to hang out with you more. Instead of viewing it as their obligation, think of it this way: to them, your presence is worth more than the price of your travel, food, and housing expenses. Obviously worth can't really be quantified like that but if it helps, that's at least how much they want you around. \n\nMy husband and I still get squirrelly when my parents offer to pay big things like that too, but they always remind us that they love us, and they remember what it was like being young and just starting out. That it feels good to pay it forward and allow us to do things we normally couldn't and see family more often. \n\nI think a genuine thank-you and a card acknowledges the favor they're doing you without being overboard!",
            "Atleast they are inviting you I'm a black male and nothing but respectful and well mannered but almost every white girlfriend I've ever had has had atleast one family member who's had a problem with me.

        "selftext": "My sister was set to marry a guy who was a complete douchebag.  He seemed like a nice catch to any outsider; he was tall, handsome, very confident, a doctor, basically the sort of guy any woman would swoon over.  Unfortunately he was a sociopathic unrepentant narcissist devoid of any empathy who would take out his anger on anybody he felt beneath him and seemed to enjoy doing it.\n\nYou know how basically they say, don't look at how your partner treats you, look at how he treats others, and thats how he'll eventually treat you? My sister didn't pick up on that. I picked up on it early, this guy was really mean, would berate and insult people for the smallest thing and would lose his cool with anybody who looked at him the wrong way.  He started doing it to me, and I told my sister early on this guy's an asshole.  She was like \"nah, you two will eventually get along, you just got off on the wrong start\".  I told him I've seen him do that to other people, but she seemed to think \"oh, but he's nice to ME, I'm the SPECIAL one, maybe I can change him!\" Or I have no idea what she was thinking.\n\nAfter about 2 years together, when they were engaged, the cracks were evident.  My parents loved him, his dad and my dad go way back, they both went to the same medical school together and have been close friends for decades.  Her fiance is also good friends with my two older brothers.  After 2 years, my sister was realising this guy was an asshole, he's always been an asshole, and he won't change.  There was a really painfully obvious example one day when we were having dinner, and my sister's fiance and my dad were having a discussion about something political.  My sister tried to offer her opinion into the discussion, and they both snickered, then this guy just started berating her and ripping into her infront of everyone, making her feel this small.  I could sense her pain, she was just quiet and just sat there taking it.  I was thinking \"what are you doing with this guy, he has no respect for you, he has no love for you.\"  \n\nAnother time our family was at this dinner function where a lot of big people were around.  My sister's fiance completely left my sister alone at the table with me, and was sitting at this other table with two women, very obviously flirting with them semi-drunk. He just left her all alone at the table.  I asked her what was wrong, why was he ignoring her?  She told me they had had an argument earlier and this was his way of punishing her.  You see what I mean when I say this guy is a complete sociopath?\n\nMy sister and I are really close, and even though I'm younger by far, little brothers aren't devoid of wisdom, and I've been urging her from day 1 to break up with this guy before she gets in too deep.  Well now, that she'd spent two years with him and was engaged, she was obviously in too deep, and she used to tell me about all the outbursts he has, how he treats her with no respect.  We often had long discussions, just me and her, where she'd spill open like a can of beans and just divulge all the bullshit that he's put her through recently.  Sometimes she'd cry and I'd be there to help her out, but she still seemed to want to stick with him.  She actually convinced herself that he loved her behind all that horrible treatment, and couldn't pull herself to cancel the engagement what with our parents, his parents, everyone counting on it.  She knew they'd all say she's crazy, turning down this smart handsome doctor! Who does she think she is?!\n\nI kept urging her to break up, but she stuck with the \"he'll change\" or \"he loves me deep down\" excuses.  It all came to a heads when one day she very publicly exploded at him.  We were having a huge dinner, both sides of our families, and I was sitting next to him.  He kept bullying me the entire night,  \"move your elbows over\" \"couldn't you wear something a bit more presentable?\"  \"stop sticking your hand out like that, its rude\"  \"don't you think you've had enough of that\"?  If I asked him to pass a bowl or the sauce or something, he'd hand it over but then pull away and be like \"say please, say thankyou.\"  He was smiling the entire time, laughing.  My two older brothers were also snickering, they didn't seem to mind this guy was publicly bullying me and having fun with it.\n\nHe and my dad started having one of their conversations again, and my dad started airing out all his general frustrations and disappointments regarding me, and they started both talking about my life openly in front of me.  Her fiance then turned to me and started openly lecturing me, and when I tried to ignore him \"hey, are you listening to me? whats the matter with you? your dad never taught you any respect?\"\n\nMy sister just then basically exploded. She was sitting at the other side of the table (guessing she didn't want to be near him) but she was watching what was going on the entire time.  She just stood up and completely exploded, it was horribly frightening and scary.  She started shouting at him \"LEAVE HIM ALONE. HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING TO YOU, WHY ARE YOU PICKING ON HIM. JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE\" etc etc.  I'd never seen her shout like that or explode like that in my entire life, it was absolutely terrifying.  We were all stunned silent.  She had tears in her eyes and ran upstairs crying.\n\nI wanted to go upstairs to speak with her and comfort her, my dad was like \"where are you going?\" I told him I just wanted to see how sis was doing and check up on her, he was just like \"no you stay here, you stay seated\". So he made me stay seated until the end of the dinner. For hours my sister was up there I didn't even know how she was, my dad or mom didn't care, my two older brothers didn't care; I had to wait hours till everyone left before I could slip up and go talk to her.\n\nShe was an absolute mess, crying, mascara running all down her face like darth maul.  I told her she has to end this, she's going to jeopardise her entire life if she continues with this guy.  She has to do the painful thing now and rip off the bandaid.  I told her 'you might think its okay if he just does this to you because you can take it, but do you really want to bear his kids?  what if you have his kids, and then he starts treating them the same way?'\n\nShe finally agreed with me and said she would end their relationship and break up, it was the only option.  I just asked one thing, that she doesn't tell anyone that I convinced her to do it, because they all already seemed to have it in for me enough already.\n\nWell the one thing I asked her to do, she couldn't hold up her end.  She still somehow let everyone know that **I** was the one who so graciously helped her make the right decision.  Of course this immediately made everyone hate me.  Aside from my dad occasionally going off at me and shouting, it was mostly just the silent treatment and people giving me glares, which was easy enough for me to bear.\n\nMy sister moved all her stuff over the next few days out of her fiance's place back into her own apartment which apparently she's gonna live in indefinitely now.  Her old room in our house has been converted into a billiard/pool table room anyway.\n\nMy dad and brothers were making my life hell for me, they blamed me for everything. My mom was occasionally nice to me but she's nice to everyone, I could feel her disappoint with me ran very deep.  She didn't offer any words of comfort or advice even though she knew my dad and brothers hated me right now.  My brothers basically flat out refused to talk to me aside from a few sentence words here and there, they didn't want to engage with me on any level even when I'd try to start conversations with them.  My dad I just tried to avoid so he doesn't have an angry outburst.\n\nIt all erupted eventually into a huge fight between me and him.  He was just shouting at me on and on and on, telling me I was a pathetic loser, disgusting.  My brothers told me how much they hated me.  My dad kept saying \"its not enough that you ruin your own life and turn yourself into a failure, now you have to drag your sister down to and ruin her life? why do you hate everyone and try to ruin our family?\"  No matter how much I tried to explain how this guy wasn't a good guy, they seemed to think it was just a personal vendetta I had against him.  My brother told me that I didn't deserve to have my sister as my sister, I told him to go fuck himself.  My dad was like \"what did you say?\" I told him he could go fuck himself as well.  Admittedly, I lost my cool after hours of all of them attacking me and I shouldn't have said that.  My dad absolutely lost it with me and told me to get out of his house, he never wanted to see me ever again.\n\nI tried to apologise, he basically just told me to get out, even though I was on the verge of tears.  I left the house and they locked the door behind me.\n\nI called my sister, she came and picked me up and drove me to her place where I explained to her everything that had happened.  She told me she'd call them the next morning and talk to dad once he'd cooled down, and then he'd be happy to take me back.  I was still kind of teary and she comforted me and told me I shouldn't hate myself or take too seriously what my dad says, and I had been the only one brave enough to convince her to do the right thing.  Her place isn't big, but she let me stay there; her double bed is just wide enough for two people but it was cozy so we slept well and fine and the next morning she called up my parents home.  She wanted to try to talk to them reasonably and see if she could make ammends and get them to accept me back.\n\nShe told me to wait in the bedroom while she had a really long conversation with my parents over the phone, it went well over an hour, and there was a lot of shouting.  She told me she was stunned and she had spoken to both our parents and our brothers too, she said she couldn't believe it and was appalled at what jerks they were being.  They said they were serious about not letting me back into their home no matter how much she pleaded with them, and had said she had to go pick up my stuff from my parents house.\n\nMy sister drove over there and picked up whatever stuff would fit in the car, I didn't have that much aside from my laptop, books, and clothes, and brought it back.\n\nShe herself seemed horrified at the way they were acting and seemed to be barely able to believe it.  She tried calling them again later and the next day again; even though they had calmed down they were still adamant that I couldn't return no matter how much she tried to reason and plead with them.  She eventually got pretty angry with them too.  They were seriously trying to cut me out of their life.\n\nMy sister told me as a result she was going to cut the rest of our family out of her life.  I told her she doesn't have to do that, she told me she does have to and she wants to.  She said she was permanently cutting off all relations and contact with our father, mother and both brothers until they apologised for the way they treated me and accepted me back into their family.  I told her she doesn't have to do that, she insisted its the least she could do.\n\nInstead of making me feel good, it just made me feel worse and more guilty, like I was responsible for the permanent fracturing of our family.  So now my sister has completely cut herself off from the rest of the immediate family and cut them completely out of her life.  She told me I'm welcome to stay with her and live here indefinitely, as long as I want, even though I barely have any money and I'm a full time student so there's not many ways I can compensate aside from doing chores.  She said now that shes actually seriously completely cutting her family off, she'd like to have the one remaining family member close by. \nSo here I am now. I honestly feel responsible for this whole mess of a situation. I think its good that I helped my sister get out of that horrible relationship with that awful guy, but now look at the fallout.  I'm cut off from the rest of the family, they hate me and don't want anything to do with me, and I'm not welcome back there.  My sister has done the same to them, cutting them all off, she said even for the rest of her life if need be.\n\nIt all feel so horrible and terrible, I didn't want it to end up like this, our family permanently fractured apart and everyone hating each other.  I just want to make peace for the family and for everyone to love each other again and get back and forgive each other, I really wish there was something I could do reconciliate them but it seems so unlikely especially since nobody seems to want to and I'm at the centre of it all.  Any ideas for what I can do to help heal this huge rift and reconciliate my family? Or should I just leave things the way they are and get on with my life, for better or for worse?  Nothing I can do to help mend the situation?\n   \n**tl;dr**: **Sister was engaged to a massive narcissistic douchebag who my dad seemed to really like.  I convinced her to break up with him, now my dad hates me and blames me for everything.  My two brothers also weren't too happy with me and neither was my mother.  It all ended up in a huge fight and my dad permanently kicked me out of his house and said he doesn't want to see me again, now I'm stuck staying with my sister.  She called them on my behalf to try to reconcile us, instead she ended up saying she's cutting *them* out of *her* life and never wants to see them again until they apologise for the way they treated me and make up for it.  I feel horrible and partly responsible for this whole mess, but I just wish there was something I could do to help mend the situation?**",

            "Unfortunately, I think part of the reason your sister wound up with this jerk in the first place is that your family conditioned her to think that her needs aren't as important as pleasing other people.  Think about it: they're screaming at you for \"ruining her life,\" even though she's standing right there telling them the exact opposite.  Which means they'd either rather double down on punishing you than admit they were wrong, or they're more upset about this guy not becoming a part of the family than how he treats actual family.  \n\nEither way, that's their issue, not yours.  Take advantage of your sister's support, and assuming your family doesn't realize they're being idiots and apologize, forge a new life for yourself that's surrounded by people who listen to you and put your needs above their own agendas.",
            "Bro, all you need to do is stick by your sister. If they loved the douchebag so much THEY can marry him. You can't convince them.    \nMake sure you get any documents you may need like birth certificate and passport etc.    \nWhat are you doing for school? or work?    \nTalk with your sister and see if she even wants to mend the rift and what she wants to do from here.",
            "It's time to move on. The main reason everyone loved your sister's fiance was because he was just like them. If you look back on your life, I'd bet you'd see everyone being similar to the fiance. You didn't do anything wrong but look out for your family. They're the ones who are acting out. So, it's time to go out and live your life. I'm not saying it won't be hard. Because it will. But it will get better in time. You also have your sister for moral support. ",
            "Well. Now you know who your real family is, don't you? Enjoy the next 50-70 years with your sister. The rest of them can pound sand.",
            "> don't look at how your partner treats you, look at how he treats others, and thats how he'll eventually treat you\n\nI've never heard this before and really needed to. Thanks, OP. Sorry I don't have advice. You sound like a good brother.",

            "It sounds like your sister dated someone who was a lot like your dad, don't you think?  It sounds like your other brothers were well on the track to being sexist assholes as well.  You and your sister are doing the right thing in cutting off the family, at least for now.  Your family (aside from you and your sister) sound absolutely horrible.  \n\nI think you and your sister should just leave things alone for now, support each other, and stay away from the family.  They are toxic.",
            "[removed]",
            "It sounds like you and your sister took the first step towards happy, healthy lives. Read over everything you wrote with the knowledge that parents shouldn't behave the way yours did. I'm sure you love them, and I'm sure the way they treat you seems normal, but no. That's absolute bullshit behavior. ",
            "Sweetheart, cutting them out right now is actually a good thing for **her**.  These are the people who'd try to tell her 'it's not really that bad' and pressure her into getting back with her ex. ",
            "Good on man, much respect for the brotherly love ",
            "You're a really great brother and I'm so glad your sister got out of that toxic relationship. You were the only one in your family who gave enough of a shit about her to tell her the truth (or even see the truth in the first place). You can't blame yourself for the choices your family has made, because if anyone has \"destroyed\" your family it is your father/brothers/mother/everyone who decided not to support your sister.\n\nIf they are rational human beings in any respect, they will eventually get over this situation. If they choose to cut off you and your sister, *that is seriously fucked up and is totally 100% their fault.* Keep your head up, because you're in the right here. I'm glad you and your sister can support each other right now.",
            "I think you're missing the elephant in the room: your family is just as toxic as your sister's ex. Why do you think she chose him in the first place? Because that kind of ugly behavior was modeled for her at home. I knew something was wrong with your family at the start of your entry when you described the ex and your dad teaming up to make fun of you. That is such abnormal behavior.\n\nYou are not responsible for your family being fractured. It was fractured long before you entered the picture. For whatever reason, they've decided to scapegoat you and your sister because that's what bullies do. \n\nIf you try to \"reconcile\", you will bear the brunt of the responsibility for doing so. Your family will not change, or else they wouldn't have kicked you out to begin with. I come from an abusive background and let me tell you, **nothing on Earth** is worth reconciling with abusers who refuse to change. You will compromise your whole being and make yourself smaller day by day, trying to fit their definition of who you should be, and you will still be found wanting no matter how hard you try. You will end up a zombie. Don't do it. Reconciliation can only work when the offending party takes full responsibility for what they did wrong (hint: NOT YOU), and takes consistent steps to change. Your family isn't doing that.\n\nYou've got a great chance to avoid a toxic family dynamic now. Focus on yourself: school, job, friends, etc. Google resources for young adults starting out on their own. Good resources include churches (and other mainstream religious communities) and youth focused charities like Covenant House. Visit /r/raisedbynarcissists to find more people with families like yours.\n\nYou're a wonderful brother. You were the only one to defend your sister and helped her avoid a lifetime of further abuse. You have nothing to be ashamed of or to apologize for.",
            "Wow, your family sounds like a bunch of WASP-y, sociopathic monsters themselves.  No wonder they liked Dr. Dingleberry so much.  He was a reflection of their own monstrousness.\n\nNothing angers someone more than when you make them feel the way they *should* feel.\n\nI've noticed this among affluent fathers, they tend to treat their daughters like cattle to be sold off to whomever will benefit them the most, like a creepy medieval noble family or something.\n\nYour dad and brothers don't hate you because you helped save your sister, they hate you because you forced them to realize that you won't take their shit, and if they can't keep you under their thumb, then they'd rather not bother with you at all.\n\nGood riddance to these lunatics, and hope you and sister can make a life independent of their strings and conditions.\n\nNothing will make them more mad than you making it on your own.",
            "Hey OP,\n\nBefore I get into the actual advice, I'd like to commend you for being so supportive of your older sister. I've had a really combative relationship with my younger brother, but we're both extremely protective of each other. Going against the grain and refusing to disrespect women when you'd gain considerable social currency for doing so takes a lot of moral fortitude. Kudos to you for finding it so early in life.\n\nMy advice is that you should move in with your sister, if that's what she offered. It sounds like she would like the emotional support. And don't discount what you can do for her that isn't financial. It's always pleasant to share your home with someone you trust unconditionally, and I'm sure she feels very vulnerable right now, after breaking up a long relationship and being at odds with her family.\n\nI lived with my brother from the time he was 20 to 22. He was an absolute mooch, a mess, smoked weed all day, and repeatedly forgot to pay his share of utilities. It was honestly not so amazing, but I never asked him to move in. He came begging to me, belly up, when he succeeded in mismanaging his finances (very usual state of affairs for my brother). Like your sister, I'm older than him. I was in my mid-20s at the time, and financially stable. He was decidedly not.\n\nI forgave him all that. I highly suspect that your sister will too, and it sounds like you'd be a much better roommate than my lazy brother. I didn't have the benefit of older siblings (I'm the oldest), so I largely figured out most of my shit myself. It's an advantage I don't begrudge my brother, because I really don't wish the same mistakes I made on anyone, let alone without the benefit of a protective older sibling.\n\nSo tell her that you'd love to move in with her, but that you feel guilty about being unable to financially contribute. See if there's anything she suggests that you can do to make it up to her. Even if you're throwing in a bit for utilities or rent when you can, or doing something like cooking when she's busy, it still helps.\n\nCaveat though: don't move in if you aren't prepared to be her emotional support. Because that sounds like why she's offering. If you feel like you'd be okay in that role (and it sounds like you're already halfway there anyway), go for it.",
            "I think you should stand by your sister. The two of you know how to support each other like family. You looked out for her best interests, because that's what family does.\n\nYour dad and brothers? They were looking out for their own best interest. They didn't care about what was best for your sister, they liked the guy and so they wanted him in their lives because it's what's best for them.\n\nIf you're going to stay with your sister, and you don't have a lot of money and she's happy to support you - I think your comment about chores is a good one. Talk with her about what between the two of you is fair, and lets you keep up with your studies. It might help you feel less bad about staying with her if you feel like you're contributing.\n\nIf this looks like it's going to go on for a while, maybe talk to her about getting an air mattress or a small twin sized futon you can roll up during the day (whichever is more affordable for you), so you two can have a bit of space when you sleep. You said her space is pretty small, and maybe a small camp bet or whatever in the living room might be something to consider if this becomes a more long term thing.\n\nShe probably appreciates having you around - someone who cares about what's best for her. \n\nHer cutting them off? She's trying to beat them at their own game. She's going to bat for you the only way she knows how. It's not your fault at all. It's not her fault either. Other people started this fight. Defending yourself or someone you care about is not something to feel guilty about.\n\nAre you in HS or at uni/college? If you're in HS see if there's a school social worker or counsellor you can talk to. There's probably a lot of toxic stuff in your family you could talk through and digest. If you're at uni see about getting into seeing a counsellor. Not because there's anything wrong with you, but because talking through with an objective third party can help you learn coping mechanisms that you might not already have. 18 is still young enough you might not know good coping skills, and a professional can help teach them.\n\nIf that's not an option, or you don't feel ready or comfortable -- this doesn't work for everyone, but exercise can help. It sounds really cliche but it can get your mind off what bothers you and can be a healthy outlet for the negative energy being in a bad situation creates. I know guys are often less comfortable talking to a stranger about their feelings, so if therapy isn't a good fit for you right now, try running, or swimming. They're both low cost forms of exercise. It's not a cure for depression or anxiety, but it can alleviate those feelings. Or if you have a sport you used to play or like playing. Whatever exercise fits you best. I can't guarantee it will work, but in my own experience working up a sweat has made nasty feelings dial down and feel less intense.\n\nIf you're in uni, go talk to your registrar or financial aid office. Often there are needs based scholarships - and getting kicked out by your emotionally abusive family is something that might help you qualify. Don't be afraid to call them emotionally abusive if you think it will help whoever is in charge of scholarships understand you're not going to be getting support from them.\n\nIt can be uncomfortable going to talk to a stranger being like 'look, this shitty and very personal thing happened to me and now I have financial problems' (I've done it, I know at first it feels unpleasant) but the people who work in the financial aid office - it's their job to help you find a way to pay for school. They're usually very nice compassionate people who got into the job because they want to help people succeed. ",
            "You saved your sister from an abusive long term relationship. Your family stood by and did nothing while he abused her (and you).\n\nIf anything, you should feel proud.

            "Hey man, as a girl who dated exclusively narcissistic jerks for a long time (because my father is a MASSIVE narcissist and its tough to fight natural conditioning), I congratulate you for talking sense into your sis.\nThat is what brothers are for. \n\nAs a person who was continuously victimized by her narcissistic dad, you either beat em or join em. Since the only way to beat a narcissist is to become one, you have to leave. \n\nYou & your sis are 100000% better off, and you will see it in time. Your dad's stunt is his way of trying to control the situation because he knows he can't control his kids, so he cuts them out.

            "Sometimes, doing the right thing has a price. That price, as painful as it may seem, makes \"the right thing\" even righter, if you get what I'm saying. Because if doing the right thing was always tidy, convenient, and easy--being a good person would be tidy, convenient, and easy and there'd be nothing special about it. \n\nFirst of all, large swaths of your family sound like a bunch of dicks. Your dad, especially, sounds like a piece of work--and they've always picked on you because you were an easy target. You were right to stand up for yourself against the dickhead fiance, dickhead brothers, and your dickhead dad. You are young, but you are an adult--and you don't have to tolerate abuse if you don't want to. This is an important life skill. Of course it's easy for me to say all this over the internet, and your life's been turned upside down, but it's time to figure out your next move. School? Work? Start making plans that don't include your family's support. Do it to prove them wrong--but more importantly, do it for yourself. \n\nSecond, don't feel guilty about your sister supporting you. She's grown, she can make her own decisions, and her decision to stick by her younger brother is absolutely hers. It sounds like her life would be better without the dickhead convention at your parents house anyway. You are not responsible for the emotional and verbal abuse heaped upon you by your family. You are not to blame for setting your boundaries and refusing to allow them to continue to abuse you.\n\nBest of luck OP.\n\n \n",

            "Op my man... The best revenge is living a good life.  become independent asap and go no contact with your toxic family.  Also don't reject your sisters goodwill and always be close to her.  ",
            "The way your father and his golden child piled on you for hours, and then acted *surprised* and outraged when you finally pushed back is very characteristic of the Scapegoat role in narcissistic abusive families. The Scapegoat is the bottom of the totem pole, he raises others up by being beneath them, and absorbs all their negativity and stress. The way you were publicly bullied at dinner also speaks to this; you have been trained not to fight back.\n\nIf that is so, you will never be able to rejoin your family except to take up your old mantle. They need someone to beat up on. With you gone, they'll turn on your mom or whomever pushes back the least.",
            "I don't think this whole thing is about you breaking your sister up with her ex-finance, but more of a status thing.  In some form, I believe that your parents and older brothers believe that you have embarrassed the family name and your sister.  Your sister's ex-fiance is obviously a man of status and has deeply rooted connections with your family.  Your family probably thinks you went out of your way to embarrass him, his family, your sister, and especially your father.    \n    \nSorry if this isn't advice, but probably a different perspective.  I've grew up and seen a lot of families like yours.  My family is like that to an extent as well.  I hope you can survive this ordeal to see it bear fruit though.  You definitely did the right thing in the long run.",
            "I\u2019m sorry but your family sounds horrible. How could they put aside your sisters happiness just because this guy looked \u201cgood\u201d on paper and they knew his parents. For them to get along so well with this guy means they are exactly like him. You did a great thing OP and changed your sisters life for the BETTER. I would thank you unconditionally if I was in her shoes. If your family doesn\u2019t come to their senses than good riddance. You don\u2019t need people like that in your life. Also, how are they on your case about you ruining your life? You\u2019re 18! Your whole life is ahead of you. Or is it because you didn\u2019t pursue the career they wanted you to?",
            "You know why they liked him?  They're assholes too.  You did the right thing, OP.  Do the 'you and her are a family now' for a while.  They'll come crawling back eventually and then you get to decided how much forgiveness to dispense, if any.  ",
            "Sorry you got caught in the middle of this, but it's great that you were able to see past this asshole's behavior and help your sister as you could. \n\nGiven how abusive your family is, it's really not surprising that she stayed with the creep for so long. Unfortunately that's how sociopaths/narcissists operate-- win over or separate their victim from their support systems.\n\nYou are not to blame for any of this. It's your sister's choice to cut out you family... and probably a good one. Hopefully you both being away from the toxicity will lay some stones for you to start a new better life for yourselves. \n\nThat being said, it's a little soon to be declaring \"forevers\" on your respective relationships with the rest of your family. I think i'd give no contact a try though. ",
            "No offense inteded, but your family sounds like a really shitty family (aside from your sister). I also get the impression that this is a cultural thing, is your family somewhat recent immigrants? I only ask because in many cultures they dont really care about a womans happiness, only her 'status' marrying into money etc.\n\nYou sound like a good kid, dont beat yourself up over this.",
            "Have you considered that maybe your sister is actually happy to have cut ties with your family? I don't know, but it looks like she took the decision quite quickly, and doesn't seem to regret it. In a way, you did each other a massive favour.\n\n",
            "Wow. It seems like you were the whipping boy for your family. Your main concern is how your family became fractured after you played a part in getting your sister to dump a bad partner, but what really stood out to me is that you're only 18 and your family heaps abuse on you and doesn't defend you when others do it too. Getting out of that house is for the best. \n\nYou should see a therapist for the time being and work on yourself before trying to have a relationship with them. Talking through this you might realize just how much they hurt you and drag you down. Talk to your friends and loved ones and people who care about you . I think you should build up your own sense of self worth and then if you still miss your family think about rekindling your relationship with them, but cautiously.",
            "I don't think you should blame yourself.  Your dad broke up the family.  He seems like one of those guys who would marry off his daughter to whomever showed a good career and family connections without regard for her personal happiness.\n\nI know you feel guilty, but it's your sisters choice to cut them off.  I can't blame her either.  Your family has shown they don't care if she's with an abusive man who doesn't respect her.  \n\nJust work on getting onto your feet financially so you can get far away from your family.  Use that freedom to build a new family of friends and loved ones that treat you and your sister better.  ",
            "I hope you don't mind me asking this, but what exactly do they think that you did to 'ruin your life and be a failure'? You're 18, your life is just *starting*. They (your dad especially) sound very emotionally and verbally abusive. I'm glad your sister got away and you got away from that.\n\nOP, you *saved* your sister from at least two abusive relationships, and yourself from a few as well. I think you're her hero right now, and you deserve that title.",
            "You're not \"ruining\" the family. That's on your mother/father/brothers when they were happy to let your sister be married off to an asshole who doesn't respect her and who belittles her.  I'd also say your dad is really shitty for insulting you with her ex-fianc\u00e9. \n\nYou should be proud for being the one person who sees your sister as a person. Your mom/dad/brothers obviously don't and should all be ashamed of themselves. \n\nFamily is more than just who you are blood related to. It sounds like you and your sister are the only ones who actually treat each other like family. You're a wonderful brother for helping her break up with that guy and she's a wonderful sister for having your back and not ditching you.\n\n",
            "Your sister is a good person, the rest are not.  You didnt cause this in any way.\n\nYou need to get \"revenge\" by being a success and keeping them out of your life forever.",
            "You are too young to feel like you have to shoulder all of this guilt. After your sister finally saw how much of a dick her ex was, she also realized your dad is the same after all these years.  Your sister made the right choice, but it's important to realize it's HER choice, and not something you should feel bad for.",
            "So many people who later complain how an ex treated them after they broke up choose to be wilfully ignorant of how awful they are *when it's not directed at them*.\n\nThanks to you, your sister had her eyes opened. Few people get nicer after they get married, usually they are on their best behaviour. This guy seemed comfortable enough with your family to act this badly, but he also might have become even worse after your sister married him.\n\nIt's too bad you got stuck in the middle, but at least your sister is standing by you. Now your best reply to your family is to show them that you can do well without them, whatever it takes. Act as if you are going to make it on your own.\n\nDon't worry about reconciling too quickly. They may come around, but showing you are grown up instead of a trouble-making kid is the best response. You were a man looking out for your sister's best interests.\n\nSometimes people who have gone through a very difficult training, like engineers or doctors, have a tough time respecting people who haven't. They also sometimes do not respond well to an emotional approach. If there is a person your dad does respect in his life, like another doctor or a religious leader, that person might be able smooth things over for you with an appeal that makes sense to them. It might just be an appeal to his pride as the head of the family.",
            "I'm sorry you are going through this. But I'm not sorry that you and your sister are away from those people.\n\nYou tried to protect your sister, and you deserve so much love and praise for that. Your sister didn't protect you, but it sound like she didn't realise you needed protection and once she did she came put guns blazin for you.\n\nYou and your sister has love and support for each other. Everyone needs that. Hold on to the people who give you that.\n\nThe rest of your family hurt you (and I think you don't yet understand how much they have mistreated you). Protect yourself from people that hurt you. Leave if you must.\n\nGo no-contact with you family. It will take some effort and you will have to learn to set boundaries to deflect yourself against manipulation. But your life will be better for it.\n\nAlso, look into councelling. Your family has hurt you and you need to process this to ve able to move on. See if your school has free councelling.\n\nPlease know that I'm impressed by how you stood up for your sister. Let her do the same for you. Good luck!",
            "As I was reading this I started picturing midevil times when women were forced into marraige to gain the family wealth and power. It seriously sounds like your family see your sister as a bargaining chip to connect rich families. Thank God, you were there to stand up for her. Its good that you both broke ties with your family. Can you imagine what your futures would be like at the mercy of those people? It may not feel like it now, but this is a good thing.",

You've barely had any life to ruin! What a bonkers thing to say to an 18-year-old!\n\nWhatever else you may have done or not done, you're an 18-year-old who loves and cares for your sister, and stands up to abusers whatever the cost.\n\nYou and your sister are going to have to spend some time shaking off the crap your family has left on you, but your best days and greatest accomplishments are only ahead of you. ",
            "Something to note here is that kicking you out is considered an illegal eviction if you are in the US. You are allowed to go back and get your stuff as long as you do it very soon and you can get a police escort.  You likely don't have any damages to sue for because you didn't stay in a hotel but at least you can get your stuff back and stick it to them with the law!",
            "Wow. My blood boiled reading this. Your family honestly don't sound any better than your sister's ex. Families who love and respect each other don't talk shit about each other and laugh when they're in pain. And they certainly don't leave someone who is unable to take care of themselves out on their own, especially for defending themselves. Your family sounds like a bunch of jerks and I can't say whether they will let you back into their house, but personally, I would say that wouldn't be the ideal resolution.",
            "Your family, particularly your parents, probably saw dollar signs with him being a doctor. Your brothers just sound like flat-out assholes. \n\nIf you think you can get on your feet without your family and find work etc, I would advise that. The only reason you should even consider mending things is so they can support you while studying. They aren't worth keeping around though really. They sound terrible and selfish. If it's at all possible to survive on your own two feet and you aren't missing a massive educational opportunity by not being with your family, then I think in the long term you'll be much, much better off without your family members (sister being the exception obviously).",
            "I just want to say that no matter what some members of your family say, I think you sound like a pretty cool dude and kudos for sticking up for your sister. I think that you should give it time and eventually the truth about that douche will come out one way or the other. Yes, it might hurt you and your sister but man you sure saved her from a bullet and many years of pain ",
            "Reading this as a person who married a man very much like the one you described, you've done the right thing. It's much more difficult to break free once you're married and have a child with someone like this. The thing that hurts the most is when you see the same controlling and abusive behavior you've learned to endure being done to your child. ",
            "Family is important, but if it's toxic, then sometimes it's for the best you don't stay close. There's a lot of pressure in society to have a strong family, but sometimes that's simply not the case, and in trying to pursue that it can often make your life worse. \n\nIn dialectical behavioral therapy you are taught to avoid the word \"Should\". I *should* have a strong family bond is often one of those. Sometimes that goes against reality. The reality here being that you are routinely treated like garbage and not given any respect. It's kind of liberating to free yourself of that obligation. \n\nI mean, constantly being told that you're a loser, is that really what you want?\n\nOtherwise, if you still want it to work, I think this issue will take some time to heal. I would try to live your life and give it some time.\n\nSomeone recommended writing a letter, that might not be a bad idea either. Especially considering how you all rile each other up and how your dad insists on talking over you.\n\nAlso impressed with how you handled that lecturing at the dinner table.

Ask your sister to get all your shit, including legal documents, and make a clean cut now. This way, your family will know you are serious, and you won't have to rough up the scab every time you realize you still need something from your family.\n\nIf you need a mentor I would love to be there for you, I didn't have the best family life either and was on my own from 18 on.\n\nListen man, I know all the feelings you're feeling right now. Guilt, regret, resentment, desperation, anger, and probably the beginnings of a deep depression. They're not good feelings, but you need to know that this is not your fault. You made the right decision, you were a good brother, and the rest of your family acted completely irrationally about it, assumingly because they had figured your sister was set for life and they'd probably get some drippings as well.\n\nMore than likely, someone from your family will reach out to you in the near future, once all the initial emotions have subsided. Make sure you accept nothing less than a full apology for this, with an admittance that you did do the right thing, and that no one would try to guilt you for it again.\n\nedit: reading your other comments:\n\n>he reminded me a lot of my brothers and dad, especially my dad, almost like a younger version of him.\n\nRed flag man. You were lucky to get out of that family the way you are, and you probably still have some wrong ways of thinking that have been impressed on you by your father and brothers. I would highly advise seeing a counselor or psych as soon as you can, don't wait 10 years like I did. And keep trying until you find 'the one'. Take notes. Record sessions. You need to get out of your own head and see that things can be good, and that it's not your fault.",
            "Your sister sounds like the mother (and father) you never had. She sounds like a blessing and a great person, and pardon my assuming that you are one as well.

This will not be an easy fix, and honestly, if everyone is as jerky and narcissistic as it sounds, why would you want to fix it?  It seems like they had their snooty family image as the most important thing behind your sister's true happiness.\n\nHelp your sister with the apartment upkeep/chores, and maybe, if you can, pickup a part time job so that you can throw a little money her way.  I know you said you're a fulltime student, so that working experience will help you down the line when it's time for you to graduate and enter the fulltime work-force anyway.",

You realize you just helped save your sisters life right? She stayed with him because everyone else in the family expected her to marry him. She now can live a happy life without a jerk because of you. Bravo man! Seriously, she is letting you stay there because of how much you helped her out. Your father and brothers wanted to marry him, not your sister. Hopefully your family will get over it, if not, your sister is the best family member you have. You're young and this sucks but you couldn't have done a better job. If your parents want to ruin a relationship with their son because of some asshole, they're very igornant people. Good luck with school and keep your head up. You're a hero dude!!! Your sister will be forever thankful. ",
            "Unless you are leaving something out of the story then you need to realize that the rest of your family are not good people, and that even if you do reconcile with them you cannot trust them. It differs among everyone, but it is important to know who you can rely on in your life no matter what the situation is. Typically it's not a lot of people, and some people have nobody they can count on in this manner, but I would say for most people this group is made up of their family members. You now know your sister is someone you can count on, and you also now know the rest of your family is not. I'm not saying to disown your family if they apologize, you should definitely get whatever you can out of them, but you know their true colors now so you need to change your life accordingly so you do not rely on them. In the future something big will happen again and more than likely they will not be there in the capacity you require. Life will be rough for a bit obviously, but start accepting that this is a major turning point in your life, it will most assuredly get better.",

Don't blame yourself.",
            "None of this is your fault, OP. You absolutely did the right thing. How the rest of your family chooses to react is on them. *They* kicked you out, thereby creating the rift. They're the ones responsible for it.\n\nI don't think your sister is cutting out the rest of your family for your sake. She's cutting them out because she's finally realized that she doesn't want people in her life that treat her and those she cares about like dirt, whether that means her ex-fiance or the rest of your family. She's realized who actually cares about her (i.e. you) and is probably enjoying her newfound freedom to defend the people who deserve her love and cut out those who don't.\n\nTell your sister how you're feeling. She'll probably be able to put some of your guilt at ease. (I'm an older sister with a little brother around your age and if I were in her situation I'd be nothing but immensely proud of and grateful for you.)\n\nI know it sucks to feel like your family is falling apart and to just want things to go back to normal. But it's not on your shoulders to fix all that. You don't have to drag that elephant up that hill.

The only thing I can conclude is that they were hoping they'd get a bit of his money, as he's a doctor. I don't know, but why the fuck is this any of their business? Why are they angry? How could they not see his behaviour to, not only your sister, but to you? \n\nAside from your sister, your family seem cruel, just a bunch of arseholes. I don't understand it. You stick with your sister, fuck them. I've learned that hard way that 'blood is thicker than water' means shit. Family are those who love you and vice versa, that could be friends, anyone. It doesn't mean your actual, blood family. I feel as if the 'family' title gives people the belief that they can treat you however they want and get away with it.\n\nI know you're young at 18 so this isn't as easy as, \"Fuck them\" if you live with them.

Maybe later in life (much later, as in years from now) you can try and mend bridges but right now you need to take care of what you have, and that is yourself and your sisster.",

They have to either come to the realization that they're huge assholes and change the way that they exist, or else they're doomed to miss out on having a great son for the rest of their lives. You are a good person, and the only reason you feel guilt is because your family is being incredibly terrible. It's not your fault. *It's not your fault.*\n\nIt's your family, and I know it's painful that they want you out of their lives. I wish there was something that I could say that would help that relationship, but it's just not possible for you to start the change.

She went to bat for you and stuck to her convictions in the face of tons of family anger. You two need to stick together. \n\nYou are wise beyond your years, but one thing you may not realize yet, is family is not blood, not who raised you, not who you live with. It is who has your best interests at heart. Don't waste time thinking about a fractured family. These are their true colors. Either they will come around and realize what they have done, or you don't want them in your life anyway, I think your sister realized that as well. \n\nGood job Son!",
            "Your family is absolutely shitty and you should feel absolutely no remorse for this situation. Honestly, it seems like the same advice you gave your sister could apply to you here: you don't want to be stuck with them any further, to dig yourself into this family any deeper. It's like a band-aid, right? And in your case, it's done.\n\nYou might not see it that way, and there might be a slightly more ideal way this could've gone down, but years down the line you'll probably only see this as a positive thing.\n\nFocus on practical matters (if you need to get more stuff out of your house, you might be able to get police to escort you, etc.).

She's come to the conclusion that if she wouldn't tolerate that behavior from someone she loves on a romantic level, why would she tolerate it from someone that's supposed to love and protect her from people like her ex. You need to keep telling yourself that your sister was blind to her ex's behavior the same way you've been blind to your families. Eventually, things will calm down and you'll both go on to lead fulfilling lives. \n\nSince you're a full time student, I suggest looking for a weekend job that's within walking distance of your new home. You can move on to weekdays once school lets out. It won't be much money, but you can help cover some of the bills, food, and any new clothes you may need. If you decide to attend college, you're going to need financial aid or student loans. I'd also suggest you run down to the post office and file a change of address. That'll make sure any mail meant for you from the school or your job will end up in the right place. \n\nFinally, sit down with your sister and come up with some sort of roommate agreement/chore chart. You need to know when quiet hours are, who's going to cook each night, and who has to take out the trash. It helps to get this stuff ironed out before one person is irritated at the other. ",

            "The disappointment you see in your father is not your fault, at all.  Let me reiterate, it is not your fault.  It's his for wanting you to be someone who you are not, and no amount of your changing yourself to fit his ideal is going to make you a happy person.  His reaction was simply because he realised that he could not control you, and he has built a life around being able to control his surroundings.  This is unhealthy, and not your responsibility.  Again, not your fault, nor your responsibility when it comes to any of the actions of your father (and your brothers for that matter).\n\nAs far as your sister goes, you rescued her from having to live a life where she has no control.  You obviously know how bad it is, and you're a male member of the family, but her being a woman... well... I shudder to think how her ex might have used her.\n\nYou are a good brother.  You are a good and moral man, with fortitude to stand up to injustices in life without hesitation.  You are a much better man than your father and brothers could hope to ever be.",

However you do need to start taking steps to eventually live on your own and not stay with your sister, she is older and is going to end up wanting to resume her life with another (hopefully better) guy. Do what you can to get a job and start making a living, or go off to school (I'm assuming some of the arguments is because you're not going to college?)",

It might be rough, but I think you two are making the right decision here.  Cutting those toxic relationships out of your life, for now, definitely sounds like a good idea, as painful as it must be.

Let me ask you, why did you feel that your sister HAD to break up with her boyfriend? Because he was a jerk, he abused her, he never appreciated her right? Your family treated her the exact same way he did. Why is it ok for your father to treat her so crassly but not her fiance? \n\nWhy is it ok for you to be treated that way by your family? Remember that feeling of hatred or anger that you felt for your sisters ex fiance whenever he mistreated your sister? Your sister felt that exact same feeling too, watching your brothers and father ridicule and berate you constantly. You think that she deserves better? Well my friend, she thinks you deserve better too. And honestly? You do. You sound like a great kid, sticking up for what is right and for the one person who had your back instead of getting lost in your dad's toxic cesspool like your brothers and mother did. \n\nDont reconcile with them. You can get through this without having to beg for their forgiveness. They dont deserve it. Good luck OP. Stay strong.",

            "Your parents and older brothers actually did you a huge favor. You now know their true colors, and you're out. You're free to go become the person you were meant to be, rather than the person crippled by their abusive behavior and put-downs. \n\nI'll tell you what's going to happen. This experience will teach you the value of standing up for yourself and for others. It'll teach you that you're always, ALWAYS better off alone than with people who put you down.\n\nI paid my own way through college and paid off my debts, and while it was hard and I had to make a lot of sacrifices, it was infinitely better than being reliant upon another person. You'll build true independence in this process, and that is worth everything. \n\nYou'll also be able to support your sister. She's going to have it very hard - when you're engaged to someone abusive, with a childhood of growing up being treated as less worthy, it's easy to fall back into the trap of old ways. It's going to be very easy for her now ex to push the same psychological buttons and get her back. You cannot decide for her, but you can support her and help her get her confidence back and life on track. \n\nYou and your sister both know how to stand up for EACH OTHER. You stood up for her (and to her about the boyfriend), and she stood up for you when she blew up in front of your family. \n\nBut now you both need to learn how to stand up for yourselves. An adult must stand up for himself, because he cannot depend on someone else standing up for him/her. He doesn't want to put others in the situation where they must stand up for themselves; he wants be the one who puts his foot down first. \n\nYou have been trained to have a very high tolerance for just \"taking it\" without reacting. This will change as you get older and understand you're a man, you're independent, you don't have to spend a second of your time listening to someone you'd rather not hear. You just have to figure out how to get there. \n\nTo do that, you'll need to come up with a financial and educational plan. You have your sister's place for now, but you can't crash there forever. If you don't have any money, I'd recommend trying to get a job. If you're enrolled in a college that you believe your parents will not pay for, you need to get in touch with the financial aid office. If they tell you tough luck and they can't work out a work/study, or you won't be able to file for FAFSA as an independent, then you at least know that. You can do your first year or two at a community college, 2-3 classes at a time, while you work part-time, and transfer over to a state U after you're financial situation allows for it. \n\nYou could also learn a trade or pursue other career options; college is not the only choice. It is important, however, to do something that will further your earning potential, as without that you'll find it hard to build financial independence from your family. \n\nYour family is trash. That is the brutal truth; in 5 years or so when you have to ability to see them for what they are, you will realize they are no different than your sister's abusive BF. Only worse, because they treat their own kin like shit, you and your sister. That's not something that an \"I'm sorry\" really ever fixes, and it doesn't sound like you'll get a apology anyway. So I'd start planning to create a life without them. \n\nMaybe someday they will redeem themselves in your eyes, but you need to operate under the assumption that they won't. It is going to be hard, but the alternative is being their disappointing punching bag all your life. ",
            "Homestly if your family cut you out so easily and is totally unwilling to conpromise at all...you're better off without them. Except your sister, of course. They might have done this to you in the future anyway even if there weren't a strong reason, so it's good you got out while you could.

They also don't seem to realize that your sister is the one who is going to marry this jerk and deal with his shit, not them. I am sure that the reaction was amplified due to shock.

Personally, I think you need to use this as a catalyst to do something positive with your life [you already are by being in school]. Make sure you make all the right choices - for yourself, to show you respect your sister, and to prove your parents wrong. Finish up school, work part time if you can so you can try to contribute to the household [even if its just being some groceries sometimes]. if you can't do that, you should minimally pick up the chores [or at least the majority]. Once you've finished school and enter the \"real world\", just strive to do your best to make yourself as well as your sister proud and you can work on repaying her for her kindness and support then. I'm sure your family will wake up some day and realize what they've lost - but if they don't F**k 'em.

            ">  I didn't want it to end up like this, our family permanently fractured apart and everyone hating each other. I just want to make peace for the family and for everyone to love each other again and get back and forgive each other, I really wish there was something I could do reconciliate them\n\nReading this post was heartbreaking, but this bit stuck with me the most. I also come from a family of assholes and went through something very similar when I was 18.\n\nYou wish for everyone to get back together and love each other. I am sorry to tell you this, but that will never, ever happen. That is such a hard truth to accept. But, my guess is that you have spent your entire life trying so hard to be what they want you to be so that they will love you without ever achieving it. Their love is very conditional and by you just being you... you can't meet their conditions. I know first hand how much this hurts and I am very sorry you have to go through this.\n\nWe are surrounded with ideas that family is supposed to be supportive and love you unconditionally. We aren't told that directly, it is just shown to us as a given in media. This is why we believe that we should do anything for our family because they would do anything for us. We think that if our family isn't being supportive or loving, its our fault. We did something to make them not love us.\n\nThis is not true in any form. Just because someone has a child does not mean they will make a good parents. Your family does not love you - or anyone - unconditionally. They never will. They will always expect people to meet their impossible standards and when they fail, they will feel justified in cutting you out. They make you believe that you are the failure, but let me let you in on a real truth.\n\nThey are the failures. They failed you.\n\nFamilies are supposed to be supportive and loving. They are not those things. This is their fault, not yours. They are the ones that failed as parents and siblings by caring more about their image then your well being. You are not the reason this family fractured, *they are*.\n\nAll of these things are really hard to accept and hurt to know. It hurts to realize your family will never love you the way they should. I know this all too well. There is hope, though.\n\nThere are people who can care deeply for you without making you feel like you are a piece of shit. They are friends you make, fellow asshole-family havers, and significant others. They are not blood, but these people become your real family. They are out there and you will find them if you look for them. Check out /r/raisedbynarcissists to find people who have similar stories to you. There are many caring people there that can help you.\n\nI also strongly suggest counseling. This helped me immensely when I first realized how awful my family truly was. It can help you and your sister muddle through all the shit your family has given you.\n\nI am truly sorry that you have grown up in such a horrible place and that your family has failed you once again. As awful as it is, know that cutting them out will keep them from continuing to hurt you. Focus on taking care of you and know that there is hope.\n\nGood luck. <3 ",

You are a good brother.\n\nAlso, imo you were more than warranted to tell your dad to go fuck himself.  Your dad sounds a lot like the ex-fiance, so why should you have to respect him?  I don't believe people automatically deserve respect simply because of their title (father, mother, doctor, etc), they need to earn it.  He says you are a failure, you have ruined the family--the reality is, he has failed his daughter and now you as well by not loving either of you.  A loving father would see how this man is verbally abusive and stick up for his daughter and other people who have been bullied by him.  A loving father would have listened to his daughter after she erupted and really taken the time to understand what she needs.  A loving father would have been proud of his son for caring for his sister by encouraging her to not make a huge mistake.  He is not a loving father--in fact, he is the main reason why your sister was attracted to the asshole in the first place.  Her dad and him are old friends, they like to act pompous by bullying people together and getting a good chuckle out of it.  They are two peas in a pod.  Many girls grow up to have relationships with men who are a lot like their fathers, which makes sense because that's all they know.  They believe they deserve to be treated however their father treated them so they unconsciously attract and are attracted to the same type of person.  Your sister doesn't deserve to be treated that way, so please support her with wanting to stand by the side of the only person who has treated her the way she deserves.   ",

The only one that even begins to deserve your forgiveness is your mother, the one person in your entire family besides your sister who treated you halfway decent. If she ever decides to break off from this toxic shithole, try accepting her into the family you made with your sister. She's probably suffering from them as well.\n\nThe only thing I can recommend is therapy. University usually has free, or at the very least, cheap therapy sessions for students. Try applying for a university job. They pay above minimum wage and are fairly flexible with schedules. Talk to a counselor when applying for FASFA. Seeing as your parents no longer support you, try putting yourself as your sister's dependent. You might qualify for workstudy, so this will help with finding a uni job. Good luck friend.

It sounds like your dad is the type who wouldn't bother knocking because he owns you and everything around you, and if you were upset and said go away there's zero chance he'd respect your feelings. you're actually kind of lucky you have one family member who *didn't* turn into a piece of shit.

If this doesn't blow over, just feel at ease knowing that you love your sister and that you both did the right thing. Your family does seem fucked though, like someone else said.

Stuff that has your address, change it. Stick together, kick some arse.\n\nYou saved someone. By the sounds of it, you may have saved her life. You're the hero of this story, don't forget that.

            "You did your sister a huge favor in the long run, and not just with her fianc\u00e9. \n\nFrom what you've mentioned, your father seems like a narcissist. He was willing to let his daughter marry a man who openly berates her because it would look good from the outside. Their behavior towards you has a name: scapegoating. Check over at /RBN and see if anything sounds familiar. Maybe I'm wrong and this is an isolated incident, but the fact that you felt the need to specifically tell your sister not to let your parents know about your role in her decision makes me think you've been scapegoated a lot over the course of your life. And people with narcissistic parents are at an increased risk of having future abusive relationships. ",
            "I know it's been a while and I'm kind of late but I just wanted to offer emotional support. Here goes:\n\nIt might just be that you don't see yet how necessary this was for you/your sister and how much you don't actually need your family. Since you've spent your whole life relying on them and never known anything else, and since you were (probably?) expecting to be eased into living on means other than theirs, suddenly being jerked out of that life is terrifying. It really is. But it needed to happen.\n\nI totally get why you feel awful and responsible, and how you feel you need to mend the situation. I don't think it needs mending. This is definitely good for your sister, and while you're a bit young to be cut off from your family this suddenly, it's good for you too that you're with her rather than them. You have each other. You don't need toxic people like that, even if they're family.\n\nYou didn't do anything to create this in your family. It just sort of...happened around you. But none of this is your fault.",

Forgive my lateness but I really am *steaming* from this post and had to say this: \n\nThis whole situation? **NOT.** YOUR. FAULT. As I see it, you have NO reason for feeling guilt (for some reason that's how this post came off to me; that you felt bad), and if it helps at all, I should add that the fact that you **do** feel bad shows you as a warm-hearted, kind, caring human being - in contrast to your family. That, and this post makes me wish I had a brother like that (I'm an only :/).\n\nNow, for your family: I'm appalled and mostly speechless, except for being able to say how cold and shallow their behavior is. Their reactions also come across as manipulation (?) to me? Or close? I'm not naturally tuned to read/understand people/emotions, so there's a chance I may be a bit off. I have unfortunately encountered many people who act like this. \n\nTBH, let them go. It's not your fault, so you don't have to try and \"repair\" anything. You were an amazing brother and brave as hell. Now THAT is loyalty to your sister. \n\nAnd her standing up for you? Dude, *she wants to*. And let me make something clear once again: Your family is WRONG....and also TOXIC. They didn't care for your sister's wellbeing and your DAD was encouraging sis's FIANC\u00c9 by talking down about you in front of you!? WTF. And I don't even have any more words for after because...wow. Just no. Shame on them. \n\nYou and your sister have a beautiful relationship and care about what's **best** for each other.....dammit now I wish I had a sibling xD you guys are awesome! \n\nAgain sorry this is late. I hope all worked out okay or is at least working out okay for you two by now (can't remember whether I saw an update, am posting on the update, or neither xD). \n\nCheers! :)\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Thought I'd update you guys on the crazy train that is Earl.\n\nSo, about a month ago I saw Earl, my PTSD ridden coworker, sneaking out of the women's bathroom. Later we got a nastygram from office management demanding to know who soiled the women's bathroom-- here was not only a mess in the middle of the floor but the feces was smeared all over the walls, with a 'Hi Larry' (our office manager) written in fecal matter on the mirrors followed by a 'Fuck Suzanne' written on another. Suzanne is the manager that works on the isolated floor and one of the few females on the floor.\n\nSo...long story short, I ended up giving my buddy that works in security a heads up that I saw Earl sneaking out of the women's bathroom. Suzanne found a...'handprint' on her car door handle that day too. Security checked the tapes but of course they didn't catch shit (some of the cameras were out). Earl wasn't questioned right away, and for the most part, people forgot about the incident (except Suzanne).\n\nThe other day, Suzanne came to work and found a huge dump right in the middle of her cubicle. Several of her things had been \"touched\" or knocked over. She immediately lost it, and ran straight to security. Fortunately, since the incident, cameras that were on her floor were now running...and lo and behold....Earl was on her floor at 5:30am. Earl's punch in time is usually 8:15. He was questioned and he had no viable reason for why he was there that early in the morning, and on Suzanne's floor. A search of Earl's locker uncovered soiled rags and a filthy t-shirt.\n\nEarl has been moved to an offsite pending an HR investigation. We're all guessing he's going to be canned. In the mean time, should he come to the office while I'm there, I'm running out the emergency exit. (I'm convinced he knows).\n   \n**tl;dr**: Earl was caught \"red\" handed. He is now the subject of an HR investigation and has been moved to an offsite far away from the general work population.",

I received an overwhelming amount of responses and I've shared all the love and get well wishes with Brit. \n\nSo.. Tomorrow it will be two weeks since the horrendous dinner my mom (Dawn) hosted that landed Brit in the hospital for five days. \n\nTo clarify, Brit IS very cautious with what she eats but decided that it would make the wrong first impression if she had brought her own meal. We live in Canada and since I drove her to the hospital, the only expenses that would've needed to be paid would be prescriptions. If I had called an ambulance to transport her, she would've had to pay $385. I had no contact with my parents for a couple of days but my brother mediated what needed to be done in order to make this right with Brit. I made it clear that if no expenses/meds/bills were going to be paid off in full by my mother, she would expect I wouldn't be in attendance to dinner, holidays, birthdays or anything else.. ever. Brit's the kindest, sweetest, forgiving person I know. I suggested that we hire a lawyer to mediate and even sue my mother for assault but she laughed at the idea and told me that she was fine and to let it go. \n\nThe day before Brit got discharged, she received a list of all her new prescriptions so I had my brother take them to my parents to get and if they wanted to apologize formally they should bring it with them along with a cheque for a week's pay, a week of rent and no flowers as she's allergic to pollen. Our insurance covers 80% of everything but I did indeed make my mom pay me for the hospital drive as I'll be using it to buy Brit a Tiffany pendant she's been eyeing for a while since I'm still mortified. \n\nMy parents got to the hospital the day she was getting discharged. My dad pulled me outside her hospital room and I let Dawn speak to Brit alone. My dad did admit that the text he sent was not an apology but a half assed statement on behalf of my mom who was too embarrassed to speak on it. Brit and Dawn had a heart a heart, and Dawn sincerely apologized to her and gave her a cheque with almost $2000 and prepaid refills on all her prescriptions. Brit had asked why they didn't take allergies so seriously and just thought it was her watching her weight or being picky. So they spoke of my ex gf (who Brit used to take dance classes with) and how she refused to eat anything with gluten, counted calories, and only had low fat foods. Brit was so understanding and laughed it off. The Tiffany&Co pendant I was planning on buying her was also given to her and Dawn had even told her I had hid it at their house and was supposed to give it to her after dinner until she had a reaction. Tiffany&Co also has an allergy charm and that was also gifted to her as well and she can engrave a few of her allergies on it. Dawn has even bought Brit, her, my dad and I cooking classes so we can make gluten/dairy/peanut free safely in our homes and we'll be taking a class all together tomorrow. We won't be letting Dawn cook dinner for a while, so we'll be dining in a restaurant tomorrow night.\n\n**tl;dr**: Brit's made a recovery, my parents have sincerely apologized and reimbursed her for missing work hours, prescriptions,  and rent ",

Good for you for making the consequences clear to them, and thanks so much for updating us, especially because half of reddit assumed your mom was some kind of murderous narcissistic psychopath.",
            "Wow.  This is not something we see often here.  Someone owning up to their mistakes and actually trying hard to make it right, rather than digging in their heels, pretending they were the wronged party and getting angry that everyone isn't on their side even though they're a terrible person.  I'm so shocked I don't even know how to respond.",

            "Why have you stopped calling her \"mom\"? She has sincerely apologised, gone over and above what she should have had to do, and is making genuine steps to become more knowledgable and to become close with your gf.\n\nYes what she did was terrible, but I think changing how you refer to her is a bit too much. Your gf with the allergies is willing to forgive her and you should too.",
            "I'm glad they apologized and owned up, but I guess I'm the only one left still peeved that you'd hide *anything* in someone's food whether it's an allergy or a preference. Yes, one is more serious than the other, but I don't hide eggs in a dish I've assured a friend is vegan just because I think being vegan is inconvenient and I don't mix extra sugar into a dieting friend's dinner because people who are watching their weight are, like, so high maintenance. That doesn't fail to be an extreme asshole move just because they wouldn't end up in the hospital. The fact that your parents still seem to think that it would have been okay and justified to sabotage someone like your ex just because they found her preferences annoying (seriously, who cares about other people's diets) is concerning.",

            "> So they spoke of my ex gf (who Brit used to take dance classes with) and how she refused to eat anything with gluten, counted calories, and only had low fat foods.\n\nThis is pretty much a major reason in general why a lot of people brush off other peoples allergies. Obviously a lot of people are actually celiacs but some people avoid wheat/gluten out of a fad diet and they will go so far as to claim a allergy when they eat some item that obviously has gluten in it (and a huge amount at that) if you bother to read the label. Most people don't mind handling a food allergy if they know its a genuine allergy. However if someone goes to the extra effort of cooking a special meal to find out it was just a food *preference* some people get really ticked off. I think part of it too when the food preference rather than allergy happens is that they feel lied to. ",
            "Now that's what I can a genuine apology.",
            "Hats off to your mom and dad for taking responsibility for their fuck up and making a sincere and heartfelt apology.

            "I never could have demanded so much money from my own parents as some crazy form of apology. This is insane to me, that's so much freaking money! Also, how you never once referred to your own mother as mom, only as Dawn. Sounds like your mom made an honest mistake and you still can't get over it, while your sweet girlfriend has already forgiven her.\n\nYou don't sound like the nicest person, but what do I know? Good for you for taking their money I guess. ",

            "I'm really happy your parents apologized, and see the error of testing someone's dietary restrictions on the off-chance that they are self-imposed based on lifestyle choices. Even if it didn't land her in the hospital, sneaking unapproved food in to her meal would have been wrong. I'm so happy this worked out.",

            "Dude, I'm glad everything worked out and that Brit's ok, but you really need to lighten up. I get the seriousness of the situation, but there's a thing called a measured response.\n\nYou wanted to sue your mother for assault before you found out what kind of reaction she was going to have...you want your mom to pay for a weeks salary AND a week's rent? Isn't that double dipping? And is Brit going to get paid through her employer for lost time? \n\nThe most offensive thing is that you were going to charge your mom the equivalent of an ambulance trip so that you can buy your girlfriend a necklace?! That's fucking out of line man.\n\nI am in no way defending your mother or her actions, but you didn't give her a chance...AT ALL. If your family had not been so gracious of their own accord then you move on to heavier measures, but your move was to go nuclear at step 1.\n\nI'm sure I'll get down-voted to all shit for this, but damn.",
            "I am so incredibly glad that your parents were so mature about this. Too often people pull stunts like that and then blame the person who is hurt.\n\nAlso, Brit sounds like the gentlest soul on earth.",
            "Your mom seems like a good person who means well but made a mistake. She definitely went out of her way to make up for it. It's good everyone forgives each other. You are lucky to have a \"normal\" family that's not dysfunctional.",
            "Lol u wanted to lawyer up against ur mom for this. Damn get your justiceboner out of your ass kid",
            "What your mom did sucks. I'm glad she offered such a sincere apology and I hope that the people who read this thread learned something here. \n\nI think there are two takeaways: \n\n1) obviously if someone says they have an allergy, take it seriously; and\n\n2) if you don't have an allergy or celiac disease for the love of god don't say that you do. \n\nIn reading the comments on the OP and this update I was shocked by how many people with food preferences and dislikes tried to compare their own situations to this one. People, YOU are the problem. If you don't like the taste of lamb it would be shitty to serve it to you but you won't die. Stop comparing your fussiness to this woman's life threatening condition. YOU are in large part responsible for the skepticism and cynicism of OP's parents. ",
            "This is a great update.  Usually people who don't take others' medical needs seriously don't apologize / don't apologize as thoroughly as this.  ",
            "Oh. My. God. This is my biggest fear. I have allergies severe like Brit and I usually just pick around the foods at family gatherings.  I always eat before or I plan to eat after. I'm terrified I'll have a reaction to something with the whole family around. I don't trust that people will follow my restrictions, it's nothing personal but it makes the guess work easier for me.",

            "I'm glad everything worked out. Just as a side, I find it incredibly rude and frustrating when people don't respect dietary choices. Why do people think that they have a right to decide what I put in *my* body just because they think my dietary choices are unnecessary? If I want to watch calories/avoid sugar/gluten/whatever, that's my choice, I don't need someone else giving me regular coke when I asked for diet because they don't think I need to be on a diet.",
