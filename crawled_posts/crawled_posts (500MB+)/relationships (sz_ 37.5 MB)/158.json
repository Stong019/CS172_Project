        "selftext": "You can probably imagine the details about porn addiction.\n\n\"The situation\" is me venting, you can skip that to get to my actual question. Thank you!\n\n#The Situation\n\nAt first I was patient, comforted him that it\u2019d be okay. It was good he was aware of it, don\u2019t be so ashamed of it. I think at that point he was procrastinating with porn? I\u2019m not sure where the line is to call it addiction\u2026 I gave tips on self-forgiveness and preventing it from getting worse. My focus was 100% on being non-judgemental and encouraging. \n\nI didn\u2019t mind that he was disinterested in sex or affection. Lower libido, not related to porn, right?\n\nIt got worse. \n\nI started feeling really starved of affection, so I focused on that. Made a lot of advances on him all day long. Aggressive advances and just small gestures of love, like rubbing his shoulders or kissing his head. I didn\u2019t get rejected\u2026 I didn\u2019t even get ignored. I just didn\u2019t get noticed. Mentioned it in couple\u2019s counseling. It doesn\u2019t have to be sex, but I\u2019d like it if you reciprocate me kissing you etc. He tried. Awkwardly. The disinterest was painful to see. It was so obvious he was forcing himself.\n\nI asked for things. Can you do this or that? Can we have shower sex? I scheduled sex together with him. Tuesday evening. Tonight. It didn\u2019t happen. I combined the planning with seducing him - getting us out of the door for a date, dressing up in exactly what he\u2019d like, sending naughty pictures and messages to prepare\u2026 No matter how physical the advance, like naked and rubbing oil on his genitals, it wouldn't get a rise out of him\n\nI've bought gifts for him and left notes.\n\nMy face is not the prettiest, but goddamn I have smokin\u2019 hot body. With the combination of lucky genes and daily hard work on myself, I'm very aware of looking awesome (at least below the chin :P ).\n\nSo I\u2019ve tried to make my own selfies and videos - I\u2019d spent 2-3 hours daily for a few weeks to get the best possible with self recording, so he had least could show appreciation by having me on his screen for one out of ten fap sessions or I don\u2019t know?\n\nI remember that I\u2019d dress up and we\u2019d go out and he\u2019d be so proud. Now he\u2019s ogling every \nwoman out there.\n\nLike if he sees a woman with long dress, he needs to fap to porn of women with long dresses. If he sees a jeans ad, he needs to go fap to butts. If there\u2019s a blond girl around, \u2026 You get the gist.\n\nI\u2019ve begged him to let me blow him or give strip teases when he wants to fap. Not even every time\u2026 just\u2026 I want something.\n\nI\u2019ve encouraged more sleep and exercise, I\u2019ve overly enthusiastically praised him for having fun with friends. He\u2019s not depressed (yes, got checked out by a therapist and a psychiatrist, and he doesn\u2019t want therapy anyway because he thinks everyone should fix themselves).\n\nEventually I outright begged him to get better (I left time between each time I asked to not overwhelm him). In person, in voice messages, in text messages. I explained how horrible I felt. \n\nI outright told him \"I've been feeling secondary to porn\". I'v explained exactly how I felt, how he could help by just showing some interest in me... just anything, you know?\n\nA few days ago he said \"I still think you're attractive\" and yesterday he said \"Your selfie is nice\", but... that's all. That's all.\n\nIt\u2019s not even about fapping, I think, he doesn\u2019t seem horny at all if that makes sense. It\u2019s just porn, porn, porn. He\u2019s got things going on, a part-time job and some freelance work and he\u2019s dropping the freelance work. He\u2019s got plenty of friends and hobbies, so I don\u2019t see it being a cop-out for boredom or loneliness (I think it started as procrastination and got out of hand because porn is inherently addictive?). \n\nI\u2019ve begged him to find help/support. When he didn\u2019t, I figured he didn\u2019t know where to start, so I\u2019ve made a document with therapy options and helplines, that he didn\u2019t download or open. I\u2019ve sent to porn addiction helpline to his phone so he could just tap it to call. \n\n#I'm giving up, what now? \n\nI seriously can deal with not having sex. I'm a horny woman but I'm also patient and considerate. It\u2019s this horrible feeling of being unwanted, absolutely unwanted, by the only man I want to be desired by. Heck, even just disinterest would be easier to deal with than him actively choosing porn and pictures every single time. Everything and anything on his screen is better than me (not sure how to interpret ogling strangers?). It's crushing. I rocked this situation like a champ but the past three weeks it\u2019s finally become too much for me. Now I feel devastated, alone, I\u2019m crying so much.\n\nSo\u2026 I\u2019ve tried everything. I give up. What now? I\u2019m not ready to divorce, but I wonder if a separation would be good? Not to shake him awake, but for my sake\u2026 not being around him, not being confronted with him prioritizing porn over me or our marriage. Would that help? Because moving out would also rub it in my face how bad it has gotten. I\u2019m also not sure what a timeline would be before divorce happens. Do I wait one year? One year till what, effort to get better or being addiction-free? \n\n**I want to shift my focus onto myself.** What do I do? I'm in therapy, but we're discussing work anxiety (I work from home & recently botched a big project, that's been rough on me). Note, my husband is not emotionally available to support any other aspect of my life like work, health, general concerns.\n\nBecause it's an addiction , I'm actually not mad at him. But it reached breaking point and I'm suffering. I cannot help him. How do I help myself? \n\nI need to stop thinking \"I can find *something* so I can help him\" and focus on myself, because goddammit I'm sad and stressed and crying every day. \n\nI've not been wanting to talk about it with anyone, since it's waaay too personal information about my husband, that would be a breach of trust.\n\nI'm gonna repeat this for emphasis; I do not want to divorce yet. I will consider other drastic steps like moving out. Maybe small gifts for myself can help a lot too? Like buying a full-body massage for myself. I got some donuts, lol, but that didn't make me feel better. They were yummy though!\n\n**TL;DR** So yeah, while half of the post is about being affection-starved, my actual question is: \"What do I do for self-care, when feeling devastated that my husband isn't there for me?\". \n\n## Small update:\n\nEstablished a two-day no contact with husband in the hopes this can recharge my batteries a little. I\u2019m in a work crunch, so it\u2019s not relaxing time. It should help though?\n\nNeed to hold myself accountable to moving out next month, because I\u2019m afraid of being swayed if he shapes up temporarily to prevent me moving out. ",

            "So you've done everything possible to change yourself in order to fix your husband's addiction.  Now, you're wondering what more you can do that might get your husband to stop being an addict and also keep yourself sane?\n\n\nThere's nothing YOU can do to make an addict want to give up their addiction.  Your husband has been very clear that he doesn't want to fix this nor cares about how it effects you.\n\n\nHow long you want to live like this is something that strangers can't tell you.  We can't tell you how long to stay married before accepting that you have irreconcilable differences.  \n\n\nYou definitely need to make yourself a priority and focus on what kind of life and future you want to live and if that life is possible with someone who has no interest or intention of stopping his addiction.  You should discuss how you feel about your husband and the problems you have with him especially since you are a spouse of an addict.",
            "Wait, so in addition to his total lack of interest in solving this problem, he is also not emotionally available for you in any other way? Do I have that right?\n\nI'm struggling to see what you're getting out of this relationship.",
            "It may be worth considering other addictions.\n\nHis addiction is (greatly) negatively affecting your life. Would you stay with an alcoholic? A gambler? A heroin addict? Would you put yourself through that?\n\nAnd is this really any different?\n\nYou're so young. And there are so. many. people. out there who you could be with who don't have extensive issues that there is no way for you to solve.\n\nI just don't see the point in staying with someone so utterly broken; I tried it once, all it did was waste my time, patience, sanity, and confidence.\n\nI know people like to jump on the \"break up\" response as being utterly unhelpful but this is a situation you have 0 control over. If there's nothing for you to work on, then why stay and put yourself through the pain? Everything you're putting up with and feeling is entirely voluntary on your end. It just doesn't seem worth it. I mean ffs, he doesn't believe in therapy and does believe in \"fix it yourself\" which he clearly has no interest in doing because at the end of the day, his addiction/ needs are more important than what you need, and definitely more important than your marriage.\n\nYou are effectively alone in a marriage. This man is not a partner. He is not your partner. He has shown no remorse toward you. No desire to be better. He's just some dude who watches porn in your shared household.\n\nI'm sorry that you're having this experience.",
            "You trying to porn yourself up for him is honestly just...heartbreaking. I actually said \u201cwhat the fuck\u201d out loud. That\u2019s beyond dysfunctional. ",

            "This isn't about you. Do a bit of reading about how very heavy porn use influences the pleasure centres of the brain.\n\nIf he isn't interested in addressing his problem seriously, your marriage is doomed to fail.",
            "Leave. You\u2019ve expressed yourself and your needs.\n\nYou\u2019re learning a hard, but necessary, lesson. We can\u2019t nag or cajole another person into changing their own life - quit porn, drinking, smoking, overeating.\n\nYou can state how his actions impact you which you\u2019ve done. And you\u2019ve seen his response via his actions.\n\nLife is too short. Now it\u2019s time for you to leave. ",
            "You may want to visit r/deadbedrooms as well. ",
            "OP, I haven't got much advise for you, I just want to say that - from the way you write - you come off as so self-aware. You seem like you have tried *everything*. A lot of posts are, \"I feel this way about a problem and don't know what to do\" and the most common solution is just to *tell your partner*. \n\nBut in your case, communication is not a weakness for you. I just wanted to comment on how clear-headed you seem in terms of this massive issue, it's really good to see. I wish you all the best - this sounds far more than just a porn addiction.",
            "No emotional support, no sex, no intimacy, soon he won't have a job.\n\nAddiction is a disease, but it doesn't mean it's your job to cure it. Because you can't. Only he can take the steps necessary to treat addiction.\n\nYou seem unwilling to swallow the hard pill that not only is he addicted porn, he's also just not attracted to you or interested in you. He may say that he is, but he is doing N O T H I N G to show it. Which makes his words empty and meaningless.\n\nWhat if your best friend told you all this - that her husband doesn't want to fuck her or kiss her, ignores her expressions of love and interest, drops work opportunities to jack off to porn? If she told you that she's crying every day and feels worthless and unloved? Would you seriously tell her she should stick it out and keep desperately trying to fix him, or would you tell her to pack her bags and leave?",
            "My sister was married to a porn addict. It destroyed her self-esteem. My husband and I often talk about how she\u2019s so pretty and fun she could have her pick of men. She\u2019s just a disaster from being cast aside for porn. She would beg BEG her husband for sex. He could only get an erection for porn. \n\nShe goes to counseling but she still doubts herself so much. She\u2019s been divorced from the guy for 5 years and still she\u2019ll regularly ask me \u201cam I pretty enough? Am I good enough?\u201d That type of thing. It\u2019s sad. Get out before this guy turns you into a pile of insecurities. ",
            "His behavior is making you unhappy, and it's ok to leave an unhappy situation. Understanding that someone has an illness does not mean that you need to chain yourself to THEIR illness for the rest of YOUR life. It is ok to say \"This situation isn't working out for me.  This is not what I signed up for, and this isn't the life I want to live.\" ",
            "That's rough, and I know how you feel. I don't think I've experienced anything this bad though.\n\nThe addiction is clearly serious. \n\nI actually think moving out/taking a break may help this. I'm usually not an advocate of taking breaks...but sometimes guys need to feel a sense of urgency. I mean, during this break, he doesnt know where you are or who you are with. If he's going to rekindle his sexual attraction for you, based on everything else you've tried, this seems like it may jolt him into reality. Because lets be honest, for somebody with sexual needs, its going to have to be taken care of in some sort of way...eventually.\n\n>I need to stop thinking \"I can find something so I can help him\" and focus on myself, because goddammit I'm sad and stressed and crying every day.\n\nYeah, I agree. \n\n>Maybe small gifts for myself can help a lot too? Like buying a full-body massage for myself. \n\nThis is never a long term solution. I spent a lot of time in Japan, and there are hordes of women who basically go shopping everyday while their rich husbands dont have sex with them. Meanwhile, those husbands pay for sex or hostess bars, leaving wife (and kid) at home. People use money and material things to make themselves feel better, in the short term. In the end, they end up resenting the father. ",
            "He\u2019s not attracted to you. You\u2019re doing everything you can to fix the situation, and he\u2019s unwilling to compromise.\n\nAt some point you\u2019re going to have to ask yourself if it\u2019s worth it to continue. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed it too irl, but anytime someone says that certain advice is off the table, it\u2019s always the logical conclusion.\n\nHe probably needs therapy. And the situation you have now is safe for him, so he doesn\u2019t feel the need to change anything. It\u2019s comfortable for him.\n\nI hope you take your blinders off soon. You\u2019re only hurting yourself. It doesn\u2019t sound like he cares.\n\nGood luck.",
            "Honestly, other users have suggested a lot of helpful things, however, I think the issue is that he doesn\u2019t want nor does he care enough about your feelings to get help. He\u2019s made it abundantly clear that he is unwilling to change.\n\nAnother user suggested a break. And while this may work, be wary. I was in a dead bedroom. We took a break. When we got back together the sex was amazing..for about a month and then he slipped back into old habits. \n\nYou sound like you have reached the end of your rope and while you can go on trying every new thing someone suggests, it\u2019ll likely fall on deaf ears. \n\nThis situation is exhausting, I know it first hand. I know how much it hurts because you still consider him your best friend and you love him deeply, but my advice would be to get out. It is akin to a drug addiction. Would you stay with a heroine addict who refused to seek help? \n\nI\u2019m very sorry for the situation you are in and I wish you the best of luck in whatever approach you take.",
            "You've described an insane amount of work that you've done to try to save this marriage.\n\nHas he done a *thing*?\n\nHe's not going to change. He doesn't want to change, he's taken no steps to try. He doesn't even sound remorseful. He doesn't care about your feelings or your marriage, and there's nothing you can do to make him care.\n\nI think you should divorce. A separation isn't going to do anything but give him more alone time for porn. He's chosen porn, over and over, instead of you. Time to get help for yourself and move on to a new relationship that values YOU.",

            "Edit: removed a lot of extra ranting. \n\nI couldn't find the comment that mentioned blocking the internet; there's some issues with this. The most obvious being many, many folders of offline material across devices and drives. I do not have access to his phone plan. I believe he has even used my work computer (one of my projects involves nudes of people and a strange assortment of the female files had been opened one after the other. If you open in preview, the pc doesn't even log that they've been looked at, so who knows how often it happened...) \n\nBut even if we wipe everything and cancel data and wifi... \n\nI'm wary of trying this because it feels like a lot of effort that would have no result. Wouldn't put it past him to go download some in the library. Hell, he's even talked about how the library has Sports Illustrated, even the \"special edition\".\nHe has also openly shared USBs with porn with other people, so even that would not be out of the question.  I mean, it's pretty extreme. \n\n##### I'm definitely trying to figure out where the line is. How much more before we split? What conditions would I set? What kind of effort do I need to see to belief in improvement?\n\nMy main reason to come here was so I could prep myself up the coming weeks though, because I feel very unstable. I gave up hope, so now all emotions are flooding out. Advice on that and self-care would be most appreciated.\n\n",
            "You seem very focused on not blaming your husband, and for the most part that\u2019s admirable. But there comes a point where he IS responsible, and that\u2019s in getting better. He knows he has a problem, he knows this problem hurts you. He says he wants to get better.\n\nBut what has he done? Nothing. And that he absolutely is accountable for. You cannot completely sweep away a persons autonomy the moment they become an addict. They\u2019re still making choices, still know the difference between what they should and shouldn\u2019t be doing.\n\nYou\u2019ve given him all the help and support and suggestions in the world. You\u2019ve gone above and beyond. But you could be the worlds most active, well informed, emotionally supportive partner and it would not matter one lick as long as he\u2019s not willing to do anything.\n\nIt HAS to come from him and he has no interest, regardless of what might be coming from his lips.\n\nHe does not care. He will not get help and he will not try.\n\nYou need to move on. At this point your just enabling him by sticking around.",

            "My friend is like this. He had a gf and he couldn't even have an erection because he could only watch porn. She tried everything and he just couldn't do it. He is extremely addicted to pornography, I know he has reached a point where he needs to watch violent stuff or other weird shit to get erected everyday. He is a very anxious person and he had a sad past with his older sister (I think it has to do with rape). I would ask him to go to a psychologist, he won't stop masturbating suddenly for you, it will be really hard. I fucking hate porn, I have no idea how you may feel, but I really want the best for my friend too and I know how bad is porn for everyone.",
            "You have been considerate and understanding to the extreme. You said you're not mad, but honestly, it's time to get fucking mad. Move out, tell him if he has just an ounce of respect and affection left for you and your relationship, he'll work on his issues, and then he can come find you. You've been so sweet and forgiving about this whole thing that he probably just feels sorry for himself and his horrible addiction by now, and wallows in how hard it is, because you let him. He needs a kick in the ass. Not to be mollycoddled anymore. ",
            "So ... does he want to change, or not? I think not, or he would at least be trying some therapy for his addiction. \n\nIf he doesn't want to change, there is literally nothing you can do to force that \\(and you should know that even more now, because you've tried EVERYTHING\\). \n\nYou need to look at what you need in your life, and if he is incapable of giving it to you, or uninterested in trying, then you need to find someone else who will. \n\nI know you don't want to divorce, and I know a temporary separation might be a big step, but ... you've tried. You're such a good person, I can see from your post. You tried *so hard* for him, and there is nothing that's working, because he's not even trying. It's his fault. You need to take some action to let him know that this is unacceptable, and the only option left to you is to leave. Taking a temporary break is a good first step, and if that doesn't work, you can take a longer break or start thinking about divorce. \n\nRight now, you're just throwing all of your love into a bottomless pit, and he's not giving any back, and he has no intention to change. Don't keep doing that. ",

            "You have done absolutely everything in your power to work on this. He DOESN'T CARE. I have read through your replies and it sounds like you know that he isn't ever going to get better (he doesn't want to) and yet hope that he will keeps you going. That there pretty much isn't anything that will get you to leave.\n\nYou need to take care of yourself. Find your own hobbies, go out with your friends. Because right now you are roommates with a man who has a porn addiction. \n\nI understand that because you are married you want to work really hard to make it work, but it takes two people to do that and he doesn't care. He isn't changing because he knows you won't leave and will just learn to deal with it. That is what he is doing, hoping you will just give up and leave him alone about it.\n\nI have known so many people with addiction problems and their families get destroyed trying to help. They didn't care. Because their families would let them walk all over him.\n\nTL;DR: Go out with friends, find hobbies, start caring about yourself because your husband doesn't. You know this won't change. Time to do for you and hope that he wakes up. Or divorce. I think you should move out and start living your life. Hopefully that will get him to seek the help he needs if he really cares about you and the marriage.",
            "I completely feel your pain. My ex boyfriend was 100 percent addicted to porn. We had dated for three years and lived together. He could not go a single day without watching porn. Many nights we would go without sex only to me waking up in the middle of the night to him \"playing\" on his phone. And by \"playing\" I mean, he would close out of whatever he was doing to act like he was playing chess on his phone or surfing the web. At first I never questioned his bizarre, restless night time behavior until I woke up one night to him watching porn that he didn't have time to close out. I guess he didnt notice I wasn't sleeping anymore. (Awkward) Most men will make it seem like this is an ordinary thing and it can be to an extent. I am a woman who truly believes there is nothing wrong with porn, but when it becomes an everyday thing to where you feel you have to do it to fall asleep or as soon as your wife/girlfriend leaves the house every time she leaves the house and when your relationship is being affected by it that is a problem.  Me and his sex life started to decrease and we grew further and further apart. Now I am with a man and have been talking for the same length of time and our sex is still incredible. He never watches porn except if we are apart for a week or so but even then it is not a necessity. I can tell that he cherishes the emotional aspect of sex and only sees porn as a last resort. I have never been happier. To be honest, he won't change. That's coming from experience. Telling him how you feel clearly hasn't affected his porn watching and he could possibly be the type to always need something new to get his jollies off. As sad as it is, some men are just bored more easily by sex with one person for an extended period so they tend to turn to porn. If it doesn't change, leave. It will only get worse.",

            "You make porn addiction the focus of your problem but you also say that in issues outside of sex he\u2019s not emotionally supportive. He says he cares and finds you attractive when asked, likely to avoid an argument. I think you spend too much time excusing his behavior and not enough time realizing he\u2019s avoiding the work to be a good husband. I\u2019ve been in therapy for years and to say that \u201cfixing yourself\u201d means doing it alone is utter bullshit. He is making excuses to avoid facing that the problem is him by not taking therapy seriously. Talk therapy is professional, unbiased, constructive help. Would you try to \u201cfix yourself\u201d if you had a medical problem that was upsetting your daily life to the same degree it is now or would you see a doctor? I\u2019m not a fan of ultimatums but in this case, I don\u2019t see it going any other way. Either he\u2019ll wake up and work on himself or he won\u2019t. You can keep waiting if you want to but that\u2019s likely all you\u2019ll do.",
            "Similar situation kind of. When I was 19 I dated this guy. He was a classic bad boy, charming yet so mysterious. Anyways, fast forward we dated on and off for a year ish. Come to find out he\u2019s addicted to pills and not porn but talking to other chicks / nudes basically. Some from tinder and some from Fetlife.  Every girls picture he had, were of women with large breast. He\u2019d always explicitly stated he loved large breast. I was not a large breasted girl. This destroyed my self esteem and confidence so bad. I blamed it on his pill addiction for so long. Tried to get him to go to NA and therapy.

My ex ended up seeing a psychiatrist who specialized in sex/porn/love addiction. We had to pay out of pocket as our insurance wouldn\u2019t cover it but it was worth it. This therapist was fantastic and I can say my ex genuinely put in the effort to fix this but in the end, the damage was done and will still divorced.

If you go stay with a friend for a while, maybe he will realize just how much he\u2019s isolated himself and damaged your marriage.

            "Hi there, sorry that you're going through this:(. I'm in recovery for alcohol and drug addiction and would like to point you to some resources where you may get some insight\n\nThere's a website called intherooms.com, they have online support group meetings for addicts. Not that you are one, but it may help to see if there's anything there that strikes a chord with you. I'm not sure if there's a support group for specifically your topic, but you might want to peek into sex love anonymous SLAA, and ask there if there's a better place to find help. Al-anon is for family members/friends who want to help the alcoholic, which you may get some insight on how to deal with addicts (someone mentioned here that you can't control them, and it's true). \n\nNo one could have told me I'm an alchie, I had to figure it out on my own. Because porn addiction seems fairly slowly onset/not as raggedly detrimental physically or financially than say drugs or alcohol, there's a possibility he won't change until he hits his own rock bottom, which might be longer than you might want to stick around. Not saying to give him an ultimatum or whatever, but I do suggest learning about what you can do about dealing with addiction and now codepedency (it seems like he has deflated your self worth) and it's amazing that you recognize this and are  refocusing on yourself. Start taking classes, don't eat donuts (opt for self improvement not self detriment), start bettering yourself and unattaching the idea that he has to give you validation. It's painful, but is it more painful than feeling like you are now?\n\nHe may also recognize that you're out of the house more and if you come in and start saying \"I started rock climbing or I'm going to dance classes\" it may poke him to start recognizing that you DONT CARE that he doesn't care about you anymore. \n\nDon't depend on this to fix anything as it may not. But at least you got into a new hobby and are rebuilding your self esteem.\n\n\"Plan the action, not the result\"\n\"Everything is temporary. You will feel different in 20 minutes\"\n\"One day at a time\"\n\"God, Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change (your husband), the courage to change the things I can (yourself and your attitudes/attachments) and the wisdom to know the difference (check out a CODA meeting)\n\nBest of luck \ud83d\udc96",
            "Speaking as someone who's partner had sex/porn addiction, therapy was what saved us. He went to see a therapist who specialised in this area of addiction and it helped him overcome it.\n\nThe main thing though was that he needed to do it for himself. It wouldn't have worked if he hadn't actually wanted to get better, and the vibe I got from your husband is that he doesn't care about getting better. If anything he's actually more comfortable because he can do what he wants and have you know about it.\n\nMy advice: tell him either he sees someone who specialises in sex/porn addiction or you're gone. Separate if he tries to make excuses to show him that you're serious about saving the relationship.\n\nIf that still doesn't make him see how serious this is then I unfortunately don't think there's another option besides divorce, and I don't say that lightly. You'll never be happy if he doesn't want to do it for himself, and you deserve to be happy op.\n\nIf you want to someone who has first hand experience with this situation then my inbox is always open.

You're giving the addiction too much credit. \n\nHe still has his own mind and is making choices. He is choosing to refuse you affection and is looking at other women. Those are choices. He isn't drunk. He isn't on drugs. The man has decided to love porn and refuse love to you. He isn't even pretending to love you and yet... You stand by, emptier than ever. \n\n Addiction is clearly hard to break, but the fact that he's refusing to have sex or even acknowledge you is because he doesnt want to. \n\nYou've tried everything and he shows NO remorse. And it's not like he's inebriated or out of his right mind. The man can maintain friendships and hobbies and jobs. But refuses to maintain a relationship with you.\n\nHe just doesn't care. Yet you're so desperate to make him care... Why? You're too young to waste your time, jumping through hoops on how to make yourself feel loved again. He's \"killing you softly\" for lack of better words and you're gonna stand there and take it. Yikes... Why?\n\nAnd say separating works (though I doubt he will notice you're gone unless you do a lot of housework and cook.) He puts some effort in to show he sees you, now. Doesn't that just prove he never cared enough when he had you where he wanted you? And threatening his balanced, comfortable life will lead him to change?\n\nMarriage shouldn't leave you feeling more alone with the person than without. And that's what is happening here.

            "I went through the same thing but I wasn\u2019t married so it changes the situation. What I learned after we broke up, after years together,  is that if someone made me feel inadequate or \u2018attention starved\u2019 in any kind of relationship and I made it clear but they didn\u2019t have to drive to change that- they didn\u2019t have a place in my life.

He lives in a completely different world, completely dominated by pornography. Simple triggers, such as an advertisement on a fairly innocent site like reddit, are enough to send the addict through the cycle of addiction.\n\nHe needs to change for your relationship to continue to progress; you deserve to be happy. That being said, when I was married, even this was impossible for me. We had to get divorced and even then it took me nearly 5 years to confront my addiction and get it under control. Porn addiction is no joke, it's akin to a *heroin addiction* and much more accessible. It is possible to access pornography almost anywhere.\n\nChange does not come from outside, it comes from within. He must truly desire change for it to occur; you simply requesting it of him and him saying he will try is like putting a band\\-aid on a broken arm...it is entirely ineffective in addressing the actual problem. His neural pathways are so defined, that he watches porn as easily as you might brush your teeth.\n\nYou are not the cause of the problem, and therefore cannot be the solution. I would suggest you help him get informed on what he is actually doing to himself, without attacking him. Since this is tied directly to his sexuality, I would tell him that he should be concerned about the long term effects of his addiction; specifically erectile dysfunction. I was beginning to experience it myself, having trouble in bed (sorry if that's TMI) but when I stopped watching pornography completely my erections came right back (maybe two days later.)\n\nPorn is not healthy; it is poison for relationships and for the mind and hurts people in ways we cannot possibly imagine. It does not \"hurt\" anyone to watch a video except yourself, and even if only one person (you) knows you're doing something bad to yourself, that should be enough to want to change.",

How my husband should have made me feel- wanted, beautiful, a person worthy of love and affection. \n In my case, the best thing I did was to walk away from my relationship (there were may other issues on top of the porn/lack of affection) and I've not looked back.  I'm a different person, much more outgoing and confident, my work is better.  Do I regret the loss of a 15 year relationship? Every day.

Fortunately he also asked me to take his computer and he removed his ability to access it (phone was a work phone, monitored.) \nBut he never sought help. It was like a dry alcoholic. He wasn\u2019t doing it but it didn\u2019t fix anything. I tried so hard to be what he wanted, even offering To watch porn with him. In the end I think porn was safe to him. He struggled with intimacy in general. I felt worse and worse about myself. I left ten years in. ",

There are plenty of people out there who would love to provide everything you're missing.\n\nIf you feel you can't divorce for some religious or philosophical reason then go ahead and seperate.

            "I'm not going to bullshit with you, I know you said that you're \"not ready to divorce\" but you need to leave him.\n\nI was with someone for 10 years, married to them for 4 of those 10, and about 1 year and a half into our relationship, our sex life started to decline. I tried to convince myself that it was just that the honeymoon phase was over, and that it's part of every relationship, but he didn't want to hold my hand, or hold me, or cuddle me, or even sit next to me. He always blamed it on how he had sweaty palms, or how he got too warm, or how he couldn't sit still long enough to warrant sitting next to me. \n\nWhen we got engaged, I told him that I wouldn't marry him if I was going into a sexless marriage. Our sex life didn't change, I was getting laid maybe once a year if I was lucky at this point - but he always had an excuse, \"you didn't shower\", \"you never said you were interested\", and so on mixed with problems with depression, medication and a few other things. I let it slide, but every six months or so I'd break down into hysterics and plead with him to show me he loved me, so give me some sort of cue. He always talked about how attractive Friend A was and how much he'd love to sleep with Friend C, or how Actress Q was soooooo attractive, but I didn't register on his radar. Me, the person who had been taking care of him and feeding him and keeping us afloat. Nothing, he hardly gave me kisses any longer. \n\nHe blamed it on depression, he got meds for depression, then it was inorgasmia due to the medicine that he was on. Okay, I get it. Then it was chronic pain problems and how he didn't have any energy to have sex or be intimate. Okay, I understood that too. \n\nHe had all the time in the world to masturbate, as much as he \"loved\" me giving him blowjobs, he was \"too tired\" to ask me for them.\n\nthis went on for the last 8.5 years of our relationship. I can count the number of times I got any sort of affection on my fingers and toes with no extra (could probably stand to lose a few and I'd still be okay). It completely destroyed me. I had no self worth, I spent entire weeks crying and wondering what was wrong with me. I too begged and pleaded with him to show me some sort of affection, anything. To hold me. SOMETHING.\n\nBut I got nothing. \n\nThen, he came home from work one morning and said that an old friend had divorced their husband. It all hit at that exact instant. I told him our relationship was over. \"It's not! I swear! I would never leave you for her. She just needs a friend right now!\"\n\nHe didn't leave me for her, instead we decided to open our marriage and try to see if that ignited a spark that was lost. He slept with her for \"the first time\" and came home and told me about it. They'd been sleeping together for months, I knew. He knew I knew.  He still tried to play it off.  I paid his bills, I made sure he could get his food and redbull and cigarettes. He wanted to keep me around for the creature comforts.\n\nI left him on our 5th wedding anniversary after he spent the morning screaming at me for \"never being home and cleaning\"\n\nI found someone who holds my hand, I found someone who constantly tells me how sexy I am, how beautiful I am, how wonderful I am. I found someone who loves to touch and be around me. I found someone who has actually managed to out-do my sex drive. \n\nThere is someone better for you out there. Leave this guy, staying with someone because it's comfortable and all that you know isn't a good way to live. Take a chance. Go find someone who you can see staring at you with a smile out of the corner of your eye.\n\nYou can find them. You just have to take that first step.\n\nedit: spelling and clarification.",
            "The only people I've heard of who have recovered from porn addiction have either gone to extensive counseling with a sex therapist or they have forced themselves not to masturbate to porn (or masturbate at all) for like 60-90 days. By abstaining for at least a couple of months, many guys find that they start to crave sex more and enjoy the sensations of intercourse again but that can only occur if they can manage to keep their penises out of the deathgrip of their hands for long enough that a real vagina can start to feel amazing to be inside of again.\n\nAddictions are often people's way of dealing with stress or other issues, so when a guy addicted to porn stops masturbating to it all the time he is going to feel edgy, anxious and even agitated or angry at first because the feelings and thoughts that he tries to stuff down in his daily life by masturbating are going to come bubbling to the surface. That's why it is good to have a therapist to talk to because a lot of men don't open up enough and sex is definitely more intimate and open that masturbating. Masturbation is relief. Its something we can do in private. Sex on the other hand is connection and there are other people's feeling involved even if it's just casual. Someone who has hardcore anxiety like your partner will definitely avoid connection because the thought of it exhausts him!\n\nA therapist can help your guy understand what he is running from by over using porn and hopefully help him stop running and be ready to face life, his feelings and you in a much healthier way.\n\nThe bottom line though is that you can't help someone else or yourself to the full extent when you are trapped in a toxic relationship. If the person who needs help does not want it and stays stuck in their rut, it will only wear you down. Sometimes the only sufficient form of self-care is to leave. You are getting pretty far past the point of trips to the spa and massages being able to provide you much fulfillment or self-esteem. If you really want to take care of yourself then you need to lay it out on the table for him that he either aggressively seeks help NOW or you are leaving for good. And be prepared to follow through!",
            "You say that you're dead set on staying in this marriage at present. That you'd consider moving out but not taking a break, because that's for relationships and not marriages (which you don't believe can recover from them). I think it might be worthwhile for you to step back from this whole situation for a bit and consider the question \"what does marriage mean to me? What do I want from a marriage? What do I expect?\" And then see how much of that is actually being met right now. Are you committed because it's a marriage, or because it's giving you what you want/need?\n\nYou've poured considerable time and energy into this man and this relationship, bending over backwards (figuratively and literally, I'd guess) to try and fix *his* issues. But what has he done to fix them? Quite frankly he seems perfectly content to carry on without making any changes. What's more offensive than the dead bedroom is the utter lack of concern on his part for your feelings and fulfillment. Right now, your husband appears to be doing absolutely zero emotional labor. Is that the kind of partner that you want?\n\nIf he's made no substantial efforts to change, your best option is to make choices based on the assumption that this is as good as it gets. If this isn't good enough for you, then it's time to get out. And that means get out, not put one foot out the door and continue stalling while you hope he gets his shit together. I'm all for not giving up on addicts, but  be wary of using \"he's sick though!\" as an excuse to avoid making the hard decisions. \n\nGood luck! ",
            "Have you told him how serious this is to the point where it is going down the divorce trajectory? (And use the word divorce). Maybe suggest divorce or an open marriage? It needs to be made clear to him that you still take your marriage seriously but you did not take a vow of celibacy. This also isn't a situation where he has been struck with a physical disability that affects his sex drive. This is entirely a behavioral addiction and can be solved with behavioral therapy.",
            "So your husband isnt emotionally supportive of you in any way and is obsessed with porn and making no effort to change.\n\nThe best self care you can give yourself is to discuss your marriage with your  therapist and a divorce attorney.\n\nYou are very young and you made a big mistake in marrying this guy.  Dont stay trapped in your mistake for another decade",
            "Definitely do a separation. Maybe start with a weekend trip for yourself. You need to be away from his constant apathy towards you. \n\nDefinitely start working on you. Stop expecting anything from him. ",
            "Hi OP, I know this is hard, and everyone is telling you things to make you feel better, which they should. But maybe I\u2019ll try to tell you the truth. \n\nHe is not sexually attracted to you, nor does he care very much about you and the relationship. \n\nYou so desperately want to fix him maybe because you\u2019re too afraid or fixing yourself. No making solo porn isn\u2019t \u201cfixing yourself\u201d, it\u2019s humiliating. (Unless you loved it then nvm, rock on girl!) \n\nYour husband only married you because you\u2019re easy, you have a career, your caring, and you CATER to him. It\u2019s the whole package for weak men like your husband. \n\nHis addiction to porn has nothing to do with his emotional abuse towards you. He is using you and that will NEVER change. \n\nYou\u2019re not second to porn. You\u2019re not even on his list of important things. You don\u2019t matter to him. He fucked up. Let him fuck up. Just leave. \n\n",
            "In my opinion your only option at this point is to give him an ultimatum; either he puts down porn completely or you're moving out. That may mean a separation or it may mean divorce, but how he responds will tell you everything you need to know about a future with this person. So far, he hasn't made an effort because he hasn't needed to; he knows you will just redouble your efforts to help him while not explicitly blaming him. It's a pretty comfortable position for him to be in. But if he is faced with the knowledge that his marriage is now officially over unless he takes action, and at that point he still refuses to do anything, then this goes beyond the addiction and now represents his level of commitment to you. And at that point you will unfortunately have the evidence you need that this is not going to improve.  I hope it is instead the shock he finally needs to step up and take some ownership over his addiction.",
            "So I'm not sure if you're going to read this, but I was in your husband's shoes. My P addiction was out of control and it destroyed my marriage.  \n\nHe needs help, but he needs to admit that he needs help \\- you can't force him to get help.  \n\nHe really needs to urgently consider attending a 12 step program that deals with sexual addiction, such as SAA \\(sex addicts anonymous\\) or Sexaholics anonymous.  \n\nWhat you can do, is create \\(and enforce\\) boundaries. There needs to be consequences for his behavior. You do not have to accept his P addiction, as it destroys your sense of self and you end up being in a loveless marriage. Decide for yourself what the boundaries are \\- e.g. not sleeping in the same bed if he persists in his addiction. You may need to consult with a CSAT therapist to give you some advice.

            "I hate to say it, but porn might just be his excuse for not being attracted to you or not loving you. It's possible to not want to be intimate with someone because you don't love them and aren't attracted to them, regardless of how hot you actually are",
            "As a former addict myself, I'm just going to tell you straight up. His words and actions are two different things. He may tell you he wants to change or get better but his actions say otherwise, and that is what you need to listen to. Not his words.\n\nYou can stay until the end of time trying to help get him better. Unless he wants to get better, he won't. You can't force it. And it's very clear you are the only one invested in this marriage. Now, I had a Mom and a Sister who never gave up on me. Partly because they are immediate blood relatives and partly because I was still only 17. But something has to change with him. Because without something bringing him to rock bottom, ruining his nestegg or shaking up the status quo he will not change or even entertain it.\n\nYou need to decide if staying with him and waiting for something that may never come is worth it. You are still so young. And time goes fast. You've already waited so long. So you need to know now if you are gonna stay or go. Staying is just going to be filled with hurt and false hope. You will cling to the hope he will notice you and stop watching porn. Your pleading will fall on to deaf ears. And this could go on into old age or until something shakes it all up.\n\nIf you leave you will find a better life, one that you have control of. You won't be taking care of dead weight. And it won't be filled with heartache and a false hope. It may also kick him into gear to get him better, potentially paving a way for.you two to eventually get back together if he's better. \n\nBut right now you are ENABLING HIM. You are actively supporting his addiction which is where the problem lies. So you either need to stay but cut him off from your support. Or you need to leave. Or you can always just let it stay as it is. But you don't deserve that. No matter how much you love him, it doesn't matter. It doesn't change anything. It's one sided. Addition is like a parasite that uses your body as a host. So essentially that isn't your husband. It's a parasite controlling him. He will lie, steal, cheat, and say anything to keep his addiction going. Everything he has told you or will tell you has a real chance of being comfortable bullshit. I know this sucks to hear, but it's the truth. \n\nIf you want to help him, then stop ENABLING him. Leave him, even if it's just separation and not divorce. And leave him to sink or swim. Because as long as you support him, he will stay afloat with his addiction.\n\nI wish you luck, but there is no guarantee of anything with him. It's all lies and false hope until one of you make a change. And I emplore you to start making the changes. Even if it's dumping him, it's a change. It's for your health.",
            "your husband's interest in you is NOT the only measurement of your attractiveness or worthiness as a partner. i know it's hard to see it any other way, but it's true. \n\nhe's not doing the emotional work of a partner, either. \n\nthis is HIS problem to fix. but he doesn't seem to care about your feelings or sexual needs, he can't seem to reach out for help (sure, it's embarrassing but his marriage is at stake) and he doesn't seem to think there's any problem at all. \n\nwhy are you trying so hard when he is checked out and on autopilot taking you for granted?

            "Porn addiction is real, speaking as someone who has had a lot of experience with it. The thing with addiction though is that he has to realize he's addicted and change his behavior. Neither you nor anyone else can do that for him. \n\nPorn is designed to be addictive. There's just so much of it out there, and as you've said, he can find something to suit his every fantasy. That makes it really hard for you to compete. Even with all the effort you've put in, there's still things that you're probably not into that he is. People who aren't addicted to porn can understand and accept that. He knows that he can just get on Pornhub or something and there's dozens of girls that will do the things he likes to see. \n\nYour partner is being extremely selfish, but until he realizes this it may very well not change. My suggestion is to visit Your Brain on Porn and read up on how porn addiction affects the brain. I would also encourage him to read up on it as well. It's fascinating from a scientific standpoint.",
            "What would your husband say if you wanted an open relationship? If you don't want to divorce him but you want your emotional/physical needs to be met, why not out source? \n\nI recommend this for a few reasons:\n1) You'll learn again how nice it is to have male attention. \n2)You'll get a boost of confidence from feeling desirable.\n3)You won't have to expect anything of your husband\n4) If he doesn't feel pressure to please you, he might want to more\n5) If he doesn't like seeing you with other men, maybe he'll put more effort into trying to be with you\n6)You might meet someone better suited for your desires but you'll still be able to keep hubby\n7) If he has complaints, tell him that he gets his needs met by other females to the extent that he has pushed you out of the physical relationship. \n\nYou have been more than accommodating.  At the level his addiction is at, you stuck through with him. You are strong. Most women would have felt like it was a problem with themselves that kept their husband from engaging but you accept it as an addiction and don't judge him for something most would. I would totally venture into open relationship territory because you deserve to feel sexy. You are a young woman with a nice body and a lot of love and affection to offer the right person. You want to give some of that love to your husband and even though he doesn't emotionally or physically reciprocate you still want to work on it. You can't change his behavior and you have  no control over his or your feelings. You do, however, have all the control you need over your actions. You can open the relationship and see what else is opened in the meantime.",
            "Definitely separate for a while. Get to know yourself again, apart from the giant part of you that was focused on trying to make your partner whole. \n\nTry to be your own partner, for a bit. When you come into a rough patch, think 'what would I want my ideal partner to say to me right now?' and say that, out loud, to yourself. It sounds dumb, but it helps. \n\nInvest in some of your own hobbies. Try some new things, reconnect with old friends, make new ones. Take a yoga class, a pole dancing class, anything that sounds interesting. \n\nAs far as a timeline, I'd say if he hasn't A) noticed and B) cared enough to Make Significant Change (not just express that he wants to), you can put divorce on the table after 6 months. Honestly after 6 months of prioritizing yourself, you'll realize how lost in trying to please him you've been, and I don't think it'll feel too soon. \n\nGood luck. We're rooting for you! ",

'If you do not go to at least 6 sessions within a month I will be moving out'. 'If I do not see concrete evidence of change within two months I will start the divorce process' (and it is up to HIM to start proving to YOU that he's changing by the way). And follow through.

Your husband, if he wants to save your marriage, needs to be restricting all access to porn, work on you two, IN THERAPY, discovering triggers, etc. I recently had to go through also realizing I was enabling my husband with forgiveness. If his problem is hurting you, make him aware. Forgiving him/acting like it\u2019s ok is your way of telling him ITS OKAY and clearly, this behavior is not okay for you or your marriage. Both of you should be in individual and couples therapy, porn addictions can affect marriages as bad as infidelity. ",

            "You seem like an extremely caring, patient, and empathetic person. To be blunt, based on his refusal to acknowledge his addiction, let alone do anything to fix it, he does not deserve any of those things from you. I'm not married and I don't know how marriage might change the dynamics of things, but I know what it's like to be in love, and while you have said here that you are giving up and trying to focus on yourself, it doesn't sound like that's really going to be the case. Beating yourself up over it isn't going to help. You shouldn't be in tears every day because you've done everything right. \n\nTbf, I would very bluntly say to him something like \"your porn addiction has made it so that I feel like I have to prioritize your problem and your health over every one of my own desires and my own self-care. I refuse to allow you to drag me further into this hole with you. I want to be happy and feel loved and wanted, and clearly that isn't going to happen with you.\" \n\nYou deserve so much better than this. Remember that. He is the problem, not you. Separating from him honestly sounds like the best option here, as much as it will suck. But you are becoming depressed because of HIS problems, and that's unacceptable. If he wanted to change or showed any inkling of interest in getting better, it would be different, but he isn't. Good luck, you are in my thoughts and I wish you strength to get through this. Remember, above all, that  you are a good person and you deserve happiness.",

You obviously love him a lot, but you aren't getting anything back.  If anything it will give you a clue as to where exactly you stand.   You can't change someone who doesn't want to change and isn't willing to work with you. It sounds like his issues are pretty layered and he's probably embarrassed to talk to a professional about it.   I hope you can work it out, with or without him.  You have given him every opportunity so just know you did everything a good partner would and should do.  If he isn't receptive to fixing it, it's time to move on and take care of yourself.

At any point you reach these decision points, always ask yourself what you want to do and then do it. It really is as simple as that. And when those decision points concern others and their desires, ask yourself if this person is worth investing my time in, and if so then do it. There *are* people out there worth the investment.\n\nBut your time is the most valuable thing you have in this life.

Let yourself get mad about this. You say it's not his fault, but it is his fault for spewing \"people ought to fix things like this themselves\" garbage when that's obviously not working. There's a difference between some body having a problem \\(which I agree, you can't really blame them for it\\) and *not getting help for a problem*. I'm not saying become emotionally abusive and scream and yell at him, but tell him how you feel and let him see it in your eyes that you are done \"helping\" him with this problem when he doesn't want help, and that all options are on the table.\n\nAs far as self care, your ideas are good, but they won't fill your empty affection bucket. You want to be desired, you want someone to show you physical and sensual affection, and the only solution to that while remaining married is to ask your husband for an open marriage. Of course, that means letting him see other people, but it sounds like he'd rather show anybody else attention other than you.",

But they look at them as objects, not really as women\u2026 So it's not like he's looking at them and wishing he was with them and not me, he's just literally objectifying them. \n\nIn reading on nofap, guys who have broken from the addiction say that once they stop watching porn it's like their brain resets and the way they look at women is more normal again - of course they will always notice a gorgeous woman and think of sex\u2026but that's normal.\n\nThe biggest thing I took away from what you've written is that it doesn't sound like your husband wants to change it. I think you guys need to get to the bottom of that and if he doesn't really want to change it then it's never going to get better.   As many others have said, there's nothing you can do to make it better on your own\u2026 This is really about him and what the addiction has done to him.\n\nI wish you luck and I hope he realizes what an amazing woman he has who wants a loving relationship with him.

Porn can give you anything at all on tap with no demands, and everything can be a novelty. \n\nIt is hard to compete with a new woman every night with no strings attached and no need to perform for, doing anything you can think of. ",
            "You're being too easy on him in my opinion. Saying you're addicted to porn is like saying you're addicted to mcdonald's. You're not addicted you just can't be bothered to better yourself by not going for the easy option.\n\nYou're being neglected and deserve better. ",
            "I just don't get the idea of \"porn addiction.\"\n\nWhat a strange and pathetic thing.\n\nDivorce him.",
            "Take a look at /r/deadbedrooms",
            "You have truly tried it all. I hope that gives you comfort going forward, knowing that there is no stone left unturned, no helpful suggestion left that you haven\u2019t floated to your husband. However, now it\u2019s time to face reality.\n\nThe reality is that your husband has zero interest in addressing his addiction and showing you the desire that you want and more importantly, the desire you **deserve** as his wife. Continuing to ask or beg for scraps of attention from him will likely destroy your self-esteem over time since it will only add to your feelings of rejection. \n\nTake all that energy you\u2019ve been focusing on trying to fix him and put it into working on yourself. Specifically, it\u2019s time to see an individual therapist who has experience with marriage problems and addictive behavior. The therapist can help you come to grips with your current situation and accept that your husband is an addict and that you are powerless to fix or change him. Now it is up to your husband to choose to acknowledge his addiction and seek professional help. Some of your behaviors in trying to help him (understandably) sound like enabling. In your desperation to reconnect with the man you once knew, you\u2019ve actually prevented him from experiencing the negative consequences of his addictive behavior. Most wives would not stand for watching their husband blatantly ogling another woman in front of them or remain in a relationship with no validation or affection. He has a porn addiction, yes, but one he refuses to treat so that should not change the consequences of his disrespectful behavior. \n\nA good therapist can help you identify any enabling behavior and define the hard boundaries you need to set. Once you come up with the game-plan with your therapist, you can present it to your boyfriend. Something along the lines of: \u201cI\u2019ve exhausted all my resources. You are a porn addict and your behavior has not improved in the slightest. Your addiction has impacted our relationship negatively in the following ways (give examples like the ones in your post). In order to stay in our relationship, you must seek weekly professional therapy for your addiction at one of the following places. We also need to attend couples therapy together to rebuild our relationship, especially with regard to affection and sex. If you do not seek treatment by x date, I want to separate, as I can no longer enable your addictions and stay in a marriage that provides me with little to no validation, affection, and sex.\u201d \n\nThe most difficult part will be giving the hard boundary and then following through. If it helps you, think of it like you would like another addiction, such as to alcohol or heroin. Would you encourage a friend married to an alcoholic who won\u2019t get help or would you tell her she must tell her husband to get professional help in order to stay in the marriage? Of course it would be the latter. Just because it\u2019s porn doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t be every bit as toxic checked out from the marriage as a drug addict. Active addicts are inherently selfish and put their drug of choice above all else in their lives. It is time to put yourself first. ",
            "It sounds like you have gone above and beyond to accommodate his addiction and offered him endless support and understanding with little interest from him. You are hurting, and will continue to hurt unless you take care of yourself and your needs. Would you be interested in the idea of an open relationship? I would be curious to know his reaction if you posed this to him. ",
            "I think you should do a 6 month separation, and tell him he gets help, or you're done.  You've been insanely patient with someone, but that has to end when that person will not help themselves.",
            ">I\u2019ve begged him to let me blow him or give strip teases when he wants to fap. \n\nNever thought I would hear a guy rejecting a blowjob. Like what the actual fuck ? ",
            "Cheat on him, and tell him. He\u2019s become way too comfortable.",
            "I agree with everyone else here that your situation is pretty hopeless. That said, since you want to keep trying I have a suggestion.\n\nGo on vacation to a remote cabin and leave all electronic devices at home. (You'll probably have to do a luggage search for hidden porn.) It would be interesting to see what no access to porn for a week or two does to your husband.  He may turn into an angry mess. He might last 2 hours and go home. He may rediscover his libido and you'll have complicated feelings about it.  You might reconnect only to find nothing changes when you return. \n\nWhatever happens it's worth trying to disrupt the status quo. Maybe it will start you guys on a path to a fix. Or maybe you'll conclude it's time to end the marriage. ",

I love you and i want to support you and want you to start using ______ so we can get our marriage back to a good place and if you're not willing to do that for me then I need some time to really consider if this is a marriage I still want to be in so I think we should seperate.\n\nThe blank can be The Fortify Ptogram, Covenant Eyes, X3 Watch Accountability Software, The Victory App or something along those lines. I wouldn't recommend pushing therapy at the moment since you know he's against it, but maybe getting him to agree to one or more of the above mentioned programs will open the door for him to see the pain he's causing you that he might open up to therapy in the future. \n\nBest of luck to you, and try not to take it personally it's not you it's the porn and what it does to his brain chemistry \u2764\n",
            "Pretty surprised nobody here has mentioned the most obvious way for him to get better. \n\nOP I stress this very heavily, he has to WANT  to get better, if he doesnt want to get better, you're wasting your time with him. But if he wants to get better, he can get past this very quickly.\n\n\nYour husband has to do 7 consecutive days of no release and no porn or any sexual content including sex. Its going to be hell on earth for him, but if he makes it through he will be well on the way to recovery. Get him to subscribe to no fap aswell and encourage him to post and read the material. He will fall off the horse for sure. But transparency between the two of you is important, everytime he relapses you need to **congratulate** him for trying and going as far as he did, and encourage him to start again. \n\n\nWill be a long process of healing, but its very doable **As long as he himself wants to be better**. \n\nWish you the best",
            "He sounds very disinterested in you and I feel like that may be him unable to understand that he needs to break it off or he may feel trapped and not see that as an option.

            " A part of my manhood dies when I read stories like this. No woman should complain about her man not satisfying her intimacy needs unless there is an underlying medical issue. \n\nUltimately OP, this sort of behavior is pervasive in your marriage and will consume it. Sit him down and tell him either he works on the marriage and therapy or this is the end. Don\u2019t waste your life another day on non working solutions. ",
            "Sex is scary for men. It requires us to be vulnerable, providing, and we feel judged and inadequate.  I don't think your husband is unattracted to you - I think he's afraid of it. He's afraid of being a failure, so he'd rather not try.\n\nIt's not about you, but you can tell him that he's enough, that he's good enough, and that you appreciate him.  And he needs to be willing to get past the discomfort of feeling ashamed. Only then can he reconnect with you.",
            "Sorry, grazed and went to your TL;DR. Have you both seen a therapist? He sounds like he REALLY needs to get in to see one. Especially if he doesn\u2019t believe that what he is doing is a problem. ",
            "The porn is irrelevant. He's not addressing your needs.",
            "So, first, there's a difference between addiction and compulsion. When we say \"someone has a shopping addiction\", what they really have is a shopping compulsion. Chemical addiction is a different set of processes: Drugs/Alcohol replace, weaken, damage, and may actually destroy the pleasure centers of the brain so that the person can no longer PHYSICALLY experience happiness without that chemical as a pathway. This is not what your husband is experiencing.\n\nYou've given him a hundred chances. You want to work on it as partners. You want him to \"wake up\" and participate again. But you've been doing all the heavy lifting, and that's the real thing you can't change: his effort. It'd be different if he WANTED to change, and was just as frustrated as you. But no matter how much you cry, scream, and beg he's just not invested in this.\n\nDon't torture yourself. I think your biggest enemy here surprisingly isn't him, it's your self-esteem. You're worried about all the things that make you \"undesirable\" (hang-ups about your face, organisation, whatever) that you know how your husband reacts to, but is intimidating to put yourself out there again for strangers.\n\nRight now you're looking for a safe \"intermediate\" step. Personally, I don't do breaks. And the cleaner a dissolution you make, the more time you're going to have to heal. Time is your friend, but dragging things out isn't.\n\nI think moving out is a good step, though. You can see how you feel. My guess will be: relief! If you get there and want to start dating again, dissolve the marriage first. You're being hard on yourself, but people put up with a lot in relationships: Look at what you've put up with! In the mean time, yeah, maybe take up a hobby you've always meant to check out.",
            "NoFap completely changed my life! Not only me but my three of my other friends who I introduced this to. \n\nOP: Don\u2019t leave... yet. Introduce him to this after you\u2019ve watched the YouTube videos and educated yourself on what it is. Talk to him about the benefits of it.\n\nChallenge him to see how long he can go, make it something competitive, maybe even do it with him. \n\nI\u2019m not married and have never had a SO for many reasons (Religious, Didn\u2019t put a lot of efforts into my looks, low confidence with women) but I don\u2019t think leaving a marriage is always the best option until you\u2019ve exhausted all of them. This is not to say that you haven\u2019t tried but please don\u2019t underestimate the absolute horrid effects that pornography can have on the mind. If even this doesn\u2019t work, separate from him for a certain amount of time and if he doesn\u2019t change his ways, then leave him. But leave him in a way where he recognizes how bad he screwed up his chances with you and in a way that perhaps you can use divorce as a way to give him a kick in the butt he needed but able to reconcile if/when he changes. \n\nYou\u2019re an incredible person for trying sooooo hard and I give you so much credit for that. Any person would give an arm and a leg to be with a generous young lady like yourself and I\u2019m sure if he was in the right frame of mind, he would agree with me and see the immense sacrifices you\u2019ve made for him. \n\nI wish you the best of luck and please feel free to PM if you have any questions",

            "> I'm going to be the sole party on the mortgage for the property myself and my partner rent. He wants his name on the house and I don't feel comfortable with that.\n\nYou are absolutely *right* to be uncomfortable with that.\n\nLong and long and many moons ago, I was with a woman that I *thought* I was going to marry.  We bought a house.  I was the sole one on the mortgage, because 1) I had a well-paying job and she did not, and 2) I had good credit and she did not.\n\nBut she wanted to be on the title of the home, and because I was so in love with her, I did it.\n\nLess than a year later, for reasons that are not germane, she and I split up.  In that year's time, I had paid the entire mortgage, as well as supporting her, because her part-time job brought in about enough money to pay for gas for her to get to and from it.\n\nWhen we split, I told her that I intended to keep the house, and she said \"fine, I'll sign off on the deed if you give me half of the market value of the house\".  Not half of the *equity* in the house.  She wanted half of the gross value of the house.  Nope.  Not going to happen.\n\nA four-year legal battle ensued, which ended up with a ruling from the court that she was owed half of the *equity* in the house (which I'd have given her at the beginning, but which she refused).  In that time, the value of the place had gone up significantly, and so my total cost to get quit of her was ~$65k, including legal fees and her half of the equity.\n\nSo learn from my fail.  \n\nDo not do this.  Unless he is contributing equally to the mortgage and shares the risk, or the two of you are *married* and have commingled finances, *do not put someone on the deed to a house that you are solely responsible for the mortgage on*.",

The point of it is to sit down and have a clear and unemotional conversion about expectations and obligations, and not have a muddled sense of ownership or debt. If there are problems at that stage of the conversation, maybe he needs to sign a month to month lease, so you can be entitled to his rent (and you have an avenue to evict), and so the rights of ownership to the house are clear. \n\nBut this is a relationship subreddit, so the other point I'm trying to make is you're both adults.

But had if he had missed payments that would affect both of their credits, not just his. And now, years and years after their breakup, with her name still on the house, she has difficulties buying a house of her own because she's still listed as being a co-owner of another property.

He's insecure about being taken care of by his girlfriend and his name on the deed at least feels like he's not taking charity.\n2. He's insecure about his bad credit and feels like he could've been if it weren't for decisions he made in his past.\n3. He feels as though you aren't valuing the relationship because you're considering the possibility of breaking up as a decision to not include his name on the deed.\n\nIn any case, these are all irrational situations that lead to him being, in some way, insecure. If that is the case, you should talk to him and ask him why it's important to him that he's on the deed. Ask him the question and then just listen. \n\nOnce he's stated his reasoning, assuming he's honest and comes clean about it, re-affirm your stance on the relationship. Meaning....\n\n* If he's insecure about being taken care of by you, let him know that's not how you see it and affirm you value him as a partner and not some charity case.\n* If he's insecure about his bad credit, let him know that you aren't worried about his past and you want to make it easier for your (his and your) future.\n* If he's insecure about you devaluing the relationship, tell him you understand how it looks and reaffirm your commitment to the relationship.\n\nThese points are obviously something you should say only if you truly feel that way which it sounds like you do. It's important to listen to his reasoning and let him express how he feels about the situation. Once he's admitted the reason, reinforce your relationship and tell him why you think it's best his name is not on the deed.\n\nHopefully that helps you! Good luck!",

            "I suspect that this won't get seen, but there IS a mathematical solution. \n\nYou can have a private contract with him, not on the deed, which allows him to consider the equity portion of the rent as an equity stake in the house. It can be where he can't force the sale or anything, but EVENTUALLY, when the house is sold (could theoretically be never), a certain appreciated amount of his equity comes back him at the sale. \n\nHere's how this works if you each pay rent: You put down $10,000 on a 100,000 loan (make believe to explain, unless you're buying in St. Louis). \n\nSo now there's $10,000 in equity, and $90,0000 in loan. Mortgage is $1200, of which only a certain amount is equity, especially at the beginning. If you split the rent, the part that goes to taxes and interest is GONE, for both. Let's say $800 is interest and $400 is equity.  Your equity in the house is now $10,200, and his is $200. Obviously if he pays more per month, then a greater portion of the month's  equity goes to him. HOWEVER, it would be better for him to make payments on TOP of the loan, because those dollar amounts increase equity directly. \n\nNow, you break up. He's a silent partner in the house, no decision rights, but his rent was slowly making a nest egg - only the equity percentage of the monthly payment - and so it feels less like your'e building up your partner's wealth at the expense of your own. \n\nNow, it's a few years later, and you feel like selling. Around the time that you broke up, you had $15,000 in equity, and he had $5000 - $20,000 equity in the house. Since then, you've been paying the mortgage and maybe you had roommates who aren't in a relationship and just pay rent. When you go to sell, you're at $25,000 for you in equity and $5000 for him. The mortgage was $100,000, and there's $70,000 left. \n\nSo you double the house price when you sell it. You get paid $200,000, and the bank  takes $70,000. There's now a profit of $130,000. Who gets it? Well, you have 25,000/30000 (5/6) and your ex boyfriend has 1/6. So you split the profit proportionally. \n\n\nIn this scenario, you hold all the legal cards, leading to security. A fraction of your boyfriend's rent - same as yours - goes to equity and assuages that feeling of being exploited by your partner.",

            "I didn't see a lot of comments that offered a solution besides not putting his name on the deed (which, 100% do NOT do!) The first thing is, you must be brutally honest about finances. Budget. Plan. I've owned a home under my own name for 15 years. I have been with my spouse for 5 years. Our system is this: we split all household expenses 50/50 and my spouse pays half of the interest portion of the mortgage per month.  I had the same arrangement with my prior long term partner as well. I pay all the utility bills and services, and mortgage. This way, monthly payments wouldn't be building equity by contributing substantially toward paying down the principal but would also be contributing a fair amount towards housing and expenses.

He also always had the key to the house and would just walk in on her at random points, day or night, for years. You REALLY, REALLY don't want this).",
            "Okay so I\u2019ve read through some comments and they are focused on telling you a decision you have already made. I\u2019m going to give advice on *HOW* to start this conversation. If you want to start it then I suggest over a meal or some other time when you are focused on just each other. \n\n\u201cHey, I know you mentioned that you wanted to be put on the deed for the house and I\u2019ve been giving it a lot of thought. Can you explained/tell me why?\u201d Or some version that gets him to explicitly name all the reasons he feels he should. This not only will give you an insight into his thoughts about the future but also may bring up things you hadn\u2019t even considered. It\u2019s a great non-confrontational way to begin and will hopefully make him feel heard, loved, and thought of\u2014which I hope is your goal for any conflict in your relationship. \n\nAfter he has stated his reasons, then state yours: you are going to be financially responsible, you aren\u2019t legally bonded together by marriage or other contract, you do not view this home as a co-asset, you have good credit and you wish to maintain that, you can afford it by yourself, etc. Allow him a window into your thoughts, the transition phrase could be: \u201cI hear everything you are saying and would like to share with you what I have been thinking about...\u201d\n\nIt may become obvious to him through your reasons that he will not be on the deed, but just in case you will need to say at the end of the conversation, \u201cso I will be the only one on the deed. I hope you can see my perspective and respect this decision\u201d.",
            "This is a great way to turn one of the best days of your life into one of the worst days. Just say no, sorry, I am not comfortable with that since I worked hard to do this on my own, we are not married and I will be 100% financially liable.",
            "Also be careful about your state's laws on living together. In some states if you live together even 6 months he is entitled to half of the house. \nHe shouldn't quality for the mortgage if he has bad credit. Plus, using his name on the documents/bills can cost you more because of his bad credit.",
            "Just tell him that the bank advised you on this and it's simply how its done.   \nHe can be added to a joint mortgage later on if you two are still together or get married when his financials are better.",
            "You\u2019re not giving him what he wants so there\u2019s inevitably going to be a dispute. However, you need to stay firm whether he gets upset or not. Accept that, then just be direct with him about what you\u2019re doing and when he gets mad, let him be mad but don\u2019t be swayed by his tantrum. Walk away, give him space and time to process the info but stay firm.",
            "Unless he pays for it fully by himself he has no right to demand to have his name to be on the house when you paid for half of it.",
            "His request is unreasonable, so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about being delicate with him. You can tell him you\u2019ve done some checking, and unless you\u2019re in a position and ready for him to be on the mortgage then the advice you\u2019ve been given is to not put him on the deed. \n\nAnd you won\u2019t be lying - that\u2019s overwhelmingly the advice everyone here is giving you. \n\nI\u2019m surprised at how many people have had this happen to them. Banks are usually not okay with providing a mortgage if there are extra people on the title that aren\u2019t on the mortgage.",

(we are soon buying together) You've been together for 5 years so far, intend to be forever, but you expect him to be your tenant, how can he ever really see that as his own home? You could get a deed of trust, which would state if ever you sold, you would get x amount then remaining amount would be split x and x. If he's going to be paying you \"rent\" surely he's actually paying towards the mortgage anyway... If you are buying the house for you both. Then it should be for you both.",
            "I'd just say, \"I'm financially responsible for it, my name will be the name on the deed.\" Just tell him no, essentially. You don't have to elaborate.",
            "Do NOT put his name on the deed or mortgage. If you did decide you want to do that, go to a lawyer and have all terms drawn up including what would happen if you split up. Every possible scenario you could think of needs to be addressed and recorded by a lawyer because break ups can be messy without joint assets. With joint assets and no legal protection a break up could become a financial hell.",

This needs a sitdown bwtween the two of u to settle this cuz if he really love u he\u2019ll respect ur decision if he doesn\u2019t ( im sorry if this sounds rude ) but someday when yall have an argument or something hell kick u out easily and u can\u2019t do anything about it and if u want to do a better thing is to make ur new house under your moms or dads name someone that u are sure 100% won\u2019t betray u in any means kay hope u settle this mess",

            "Do NOT put him on the deed if he\u2019s not on the loan. He would get ownership rights free and clear while YOU would be the sole person obligated on the note. So if you all break up, he gets 1/2 of the house while you are responsible for paying the loan off.",
            "Can you put my name on the deed too?\n\nFind an Accountant and pay them $300 to review your finances and past tax returns.  If your boyfriend mentions the deed again, simply say your Accountant won\u2019t allow it and with a purchase this big, you are following their advice.  If the boyfriend gets upset, make him a deal:  if he can talk the Accountant into it, then you\u2019ll go along with it.",

            "I can see it from his side.  You're buying the place he considers his \"home\" which he presumably has some emotional attachment to.  You're also becoming his landlord.  This could dramatically change the dynamic of the relationship between the two of you.  If it was me I would be uncomfortable with this situation.  What if the relationship doesn't work out?  Suddenly I've got nowhere to live.  And bad credit.\n\nIs there a reason why you have to buy that particular house?  Can't you buy somewhere else on your own and keep it in your name only?",

            "On a semi lighter side, I was in this position. I said no for a couple years after buying, but during that time he was putting a LOT of money and work in the house so I added him later. Ended up getting married so it became a moot thing. Dont feel bad holding out! If you're not comfortable just say no.",
            "Nope, he could probably just take the house and wont give it to you",
            "He can't have his name on the house if he's not paying for it. It's the logical way for you to protect yourself. Please try to talk to him about it and if he doesn't understand it, then maybe you should reconsider the whole thing.",
            "Do not do it.  Explain to him that you are the sole person taking the risk and you are the sole person guaranteed the reward.  There are three outcomes to your situation:\nA) you don\u2019t put him on the deed, you get married later on and jointly take ownership of the property whether it be legally or by understanding\nB) you break up and the house is fully yours without any hassle as his name is on none of the documents\nC) you do put him on the deed, break up and he takes half the house.  You fight and things get messy.\n\nExplain to him that he should want to protect you.  This is not about you being selfish or believing in your relationship\u2019s success.  This is about understanding that things happen and people change. \n\nMight be a good idea to find your standings on a prenup.  He sounds like he may refuse that as well and I know it\u2019s a breaking point for some!",
            "No. Just no. I'll even add a hell no.\n\nProtect yourself financially at all times whether you are married or not and whatever your gender.\n\nIf you are buying the house and the mortgage is yours then there is no reason to ever sign away half of it by putting someone else's name on the deeds.\n\nIf your partner is making a significant financial contribution to paying towards the mortgage and/or maintenance and upkeep of the home and you consider that to be deserving of a reflection in any future sale of the property then get something to that effect drawn up legally.\n\nAs an example, close friend and long term partner purchased a house ... friend brought a significant deposit, partner brought none ... agreement drawn up in advance protected that upfront investment by friend should they ever part ways and sell.\n\nYour stated concern is how to tell your SO this without making him feel bad. Explain that you are buying the house and there is no reason to add his name to the deeds. He is a grown adult, you are not being unreasonable, if he is upset by you doing something entirely reasonable then I think you have to question his motivation.",
            "If your scared to be honest with your partner that says something about your relationship I would worry about. You can be gentle, but if I were you I would tell him how you feel. \n\nHe isn't paying anything so he doesn't own the house. If he was paying the mortgage he would have his name on the house. If he wants some portion of the house to be his you'll need some sort of prenup or agreement on what each party owes and owns.\n\n I lived with an ex girlfriend and we made a prenup after moving in together it was the rules of disengagement if we ever moved out/broke up and it made the transition easier. I was emotionally distressed at the break up but at least I knew what was happening with my home.",
            "100% do not add his name to the deed. If he is renting, make sure you have a rental agreement as well, so that the payments aren\u2019t a pathway to constructed trust remedies later. Don\u2019t muddy the emotional and the financial, it will only cause you grief later; especially at 27 years old. I promise, if you do, you will almost certainly regret it at some point.",
            "Was in a similar position about a year ago. I had been pestering my then bf for months that I was ready for marriage, but he wasn't. I flat out told him that I was not putting my life on hold because he wasn't ready. I told him that I was ready to be done throwing money away renting and take the next step to homeownership, and if I didn't have a ring on my finger, I would be doing it alone. He wasn't thrilled, but I think he understood that I was just protecting myself. So I bought the house alone, we continued to live together and he contributed by buying necessary appliances/furniture for the new house. Honestly, I think it was good for him to realize that I was serious about not waiting on him forever. A few months later he was ready to propose, and we will be married next month. \n\nJust be straight up with your boyfriend, tell him that financially, it would not be responsible for you to buy the house together without being married. It might cause a dispute, but in the end, if he can't respect you making smart decisions for yourself, that would be a red flag to me.",
            "Just tell him the mortgage company won't do it. It will mess up the closing. Which in most states it will. Tell him you both can draw up wills so if something happens the other person gets the house/insurance.",
            "My boyfriend and I of  8 years live together and bought a house together.  Except his name is the only one on the mortgage and the deed.  It doesn't make it any less  \"our\" house.  Sure, if we ever  break up, then it is his house technically and I am ok with that.  It never has become an issue where we don't think of it  as ours together though.   If it's that big of deal to him then he can do the  work to cleanup his own credit and if you guys get married, you can refinance with his name on the house.  Until then, your mortgage, your name on the house.",
            "At the end of the day, you can only do your part. If he decides to act entitled to your stuff, and behave unreasonably, and act hurt and offended... maybe he's just raising a red flag that you would do well to pay attention to. \n\nYou're doing the right thing and looking after yourself - it's not selfishness, it's self care.",
            "Your bf has bad credit which likely points to bad financial decisions. He's 33 and can't even pay for the house yet wants his name on it. Both of you are not even married.\n\nIf you put his name on the deed, he will literally be owning half of the house without doing anything. Its just greediness on his side.\n\nTo me, for him to even suggest something like this makes me question the whole relationship. You can't have a future with someone you don't trust.",

            "\"Honey, I am not comfortable with your name on the deed unless your name is also on the mortgage. This would be a very messy arrangement if we split up. I can always add you to the mortgage+deed later. I love you and of course I want to be together for the rest of our lives, I am mainly just thinking practically and for worst case scenarios.\" Then list examples from here or other people showing when it went badly.\n\nSeriously though, most couples I know who got a mortgage on a house without being married ended not staying together and having a drawn out process splitting the house. It's just way too much unnecessary risk.",
            "Tell him for legal and financial reasons you would prefer to be the only name on the deed for the time being. If down the road when his credit is better or you get married you can discuss it again. Reassure him that just because his name isn't on the deed doesn't mean it's any less his home.",
            "Law grad here... Everyone giving legal advice on this: how do you even know what law is applicable if OP has not specified where this is from?!? OP, get a lawyer to see where you stand, because there might be repercussions on the ownership depending where you are. This is simple property law, they will be able to advice straight ahead without having to pay much, you could even go to a student law clinic for this. However, if you are in England and Wales, know that 1) a common law marriage is a common belief that does not have any foundation in law so don\u2019t worry about that 2) the only reason how your unmarried partner could claim part of the house is if they paid part of the DEPOSIT. They could potentially claim something in case of split up if they also paid some of the mortgage later on, but the case law is not on their side so far so it would be a hard case to argue. Ask him: why does he want his name on the deed? Does he plan to pay half of the mortgage and deposit? If that is not the case and you don\u2019t want to co own, kindly decline. But ask a lawyer because this is applicable only in England and Wales!",
            "No. If he is putting half of the money down on the house, then he can have his name on it. If he isn\u2019t, that\u2019s your house. You can always add his name to it later if/when you get married or he is fully contributing financially.",
            "I\u2019d suggest not asking him to pay rent, or if he does a very small amount. And make sure you have a legal lease. You\u2019ve been together awhile and depending on your area, you may be common law either already or soon. If he\u2019s paying part of the mortgage and not on the deed, he would actually have a claim for partial ownership. This is to protect women from financial abuse from shitty partners, but it can be used in normal circumstances as well. Instead, have him pay utilities or groceries or something like that and perhaps consult a lawyer real quick.",
            "DO NOT EVER put someone's name on the deed that is not responsible for the mortgage; in any event, HUGE red flag, you are right to want to keep things separate.

When they broke up, my uncle tried to buy his partner out, but he said no. My uncle wanted to sell the house, but his partner said no. He drug his feet for months.  It was awful. \n\nIt would have been so much better if his partner wasnt on the deed, or if they were married and a judge could have forced the sale of the house.",
            "I agree, I would never add someone to a deed without legal commitment to half of the cost. As for the how aspect, maybe at the end of a meal start a conversation and say, \"although I have considered your request to be added to the deed, it isn't fair to me that I face the complete 100% legal responsibility to pay for something so expensive that I wouldn't fully own in the future. Right now, your credit score would hinder our capacity to secure funding in a joint endeavor, and initially the bank extensibly owns the home with a 30 year commitment for me to pay then transfer ownership. This home will help us build a future together, but the most practical way for us to do that right now is for me to work directly with the bank.\" If he at any point says \"well not the mortgage, just the deed\"; then repeat the first sentance quoted above.\n\nedit: extra word removed.",
            "As a lawyer, putting his name on the deed is seriously one of the dumbest thing you could do. As others have mentioned you would be carrying all the financial downside being the sole mortgagor and you would essentially be gifting him half of a house. What if he decides that he wants to break up, forces a sale as co-owner and walks away with half the value of the house? How are you going to pay back the entire mortgage? \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to sugarcoat \u201cI don\u2019t want to give you, my boyfriend to whom I am not even married, half of a house and completely screw myself over financially.\u201d Don\u2019t put his name on the deed, OP, and if you have trouble saying no to your boyfriend you should probably do some growing up before making such serious financial commitments.",

            "No, no, no, and no please do not put his name on the lease. If he can not be adult enough to have this talk with you in an controlled environment, please consider the relationship. Just assure him there is no ill will but you are simply not comfortable. The no ill will or malice part is very important when explaining to him your reasons.",
            "Just tell him no.... it is a perfectly reasonable stance to take.\n\nHim wanting to be on the deed is IMO a maaaajor red flag + the bad credit.",

            "This will get buried but I'll go for it anyway.  Do NOT put his name on a house that you hold the mortgage on.  I was married to someone and I bought property and a house -- they did not even consider that his name should be on it.  I was paying the down-payment and I was responsible for the mortgage.  Later (another partner, who I am married to now) my partner bought a house - they made the down payment and got the mortgage.  I live with them.  they have mortgage insurance which will pay for the house for me if they die.  I pay more than half the mortgage and bills but I did not get the house so it ain't mine.",

You need to put it in such a way that it comes across as him recommending that idea and you are simply agreeing with him, so avoid any way that it seems to like a question or idea coming from you.\nThat way he should be able to understand that you are not being emotional and personal with legal issues.",

I told him that I would count any rent or towards his portion of the house and we drew up an excel file that shows what percentage of the house he owns by year. That excel file is part of our pre-nup. \n\nBecause I put so much more down, even if we are married splitting everything 50/50 for the next 15 years, he still only has 1/3 of the house.

            "So he wants you to pay for the house, and he gets half of the value for doing nothing. Yikes. Why don't you go see a local lawyer and see what they say about this deal? You really need someone you can trust to stear you right on this one. You don't seem to know much about morgages or buying a house. Why not hire someone who knows everything to make sure you are protected? Than you can honestly tell the boyfriend your lawyer says he can not be on the deed.",
            "You can create a lease with him on it, but absolutely he should not be on the deed (if not on the mortgage).\n\nIf he pushes to be on the deed, that could be a huge red flag.",

I think its really mature and plus you are looking for a way not to hurt ol' boys feelings.  My honest opini\u00f3n, IT really shouldnt hurt him to know you are down to do what you have to im order to protect whats yours.  If he isnt after money or anything, he should totally understand.",
            "I was in a relationship with a girl for 5 and a half years. We broke up in September and it was a long overdue decision. I actually met the most wonderful girl on new years eve/day and I cant believe how fast the time has gone by with her. \n\nI only say that because her and I are shopping for a house now. It's her money but I offered to help with the down payment on a conditional loan. If we got married then the loan is forgiven, if we split then it would either be paid back over 10 years or mean a year of me living there for free. \n\nIf you have been with someone for 5 years and are uncomfortable with him being entangled or a more permanent part of your life, such as a mortgage, then you should seriously evaluate if you want to stay with them. \n\nBy no means am I telling you what you should do with your own relationship. Just that after over 5 years with my ex, I never felt comfortable with the idea of her and I getting married. With my new girlfriend, I would marry her tomorrow without a shred of doubt in my mind."

        "selftext": "[My OP](http://redd.it/3dijz7)\n\nThanks for your comments and suggestions there. They were super helpful and helped me see things a lot more clearly. Love you all.\n\nThis is a big big update and something quite shocking. I've got to go back to my therapist.\n\nBefore I get to it, a lot of you asked about my relationship with my sister. Well. There's no relationship really. I spent all of my childhood hating her and never really had a nice relationship with her. She was not like my parents but they had spoiled the hell out of her and she sort of always saw herself as the better one of the two of us. Not surprised there and right now I don't even blame her for that. On the day that I was leaving I gave her a hug and told her that maybe if we had different parents we could have really been sisters but it's not how it turned out in this life but maybe we can make up for it later ourselves. I told her that if she wants to talk to me about this she can call me and we can meet up. She never called me.\n\nAs it appeared from the last post, I went to talk to my therapist about this and she suggested that I can initiate some conversation and see how it goes. Based on her assessment she was happy if I wanted to go and see them  I just need to understand that there's no obligation to go or stay. Good.\n\n*****************\n\nI replied to my father's message with this:\n\n> Hi dad\n>\n> For us to ever have a chance of seriously starting over, you owe me an answer. Why?\n>\n> I expect an honest answer. No \"why what?\", no \"come and let's talk in person\" or anything of that sort, just give it to me straight, believe me I can handle reading it if you could handle doing it. If you're not willing to give me that then I'm not willing to start over.\n\n****************\n\nHe came back to me the next day with a long message, explaining \"why\". Let's get right to it:\n\nHe told me that him and my mom wanted a child, and only one child as they didn't have the resources and energy of having more than one. They realized that we're twins, that screwed up everything and actually made them sad rather than happy.\n\nThey decided to give one of us up for adoption. They looked around and even found a couple. In case you wondered, I was the one they decided to give away because I was smaller and my eyes weren't blue (yeah, that's how you decide which one of your kids to keep). They arranged everything, even took me to the them but that couple bailed out before signing the papers, when they saw me and my sister. Their conscience couldn't handle separating twin sisters like this. After this they looked for some couples and nobody seemed willing to adopt one of twin sisters. They entertained the idea of putting me into foster care but they couldn't live with themselves if they did.\n\nI think that says a lot. Stranger couples, who so badly wanted to adopt a child, couldn't be heartless enough to separate twin sisters but their fucking parents wanted to do it. It's beyond me.\n\nSo they had to raise me themselves and they didn't enjoy it at all. In their minds the fact that they didn't put me into foster care was a favor in itself, more than what I apparently deserved and that's why they never cared to do more for me. Their full time and resources belonged to my sister and the small part of it that got to me, they saw it as me taking what's my sister's away. That's how they saw me. No wonder my childhood turned out the way it did.\n\nHe said that deep inside they always knew what they were doing was wrong but they could never step up and do the right thing during this 18 years. Why not? They thought that changing the dynamic would negatively affect my sister as she's now used to being offered more time and resources and I'm used to not getting it, so making it more equal would be a luxury for me and a pain for her. They thought that's not fair for my sister to be in pain for the sake of my luxury. Again, their logic. I don't even know what to say to that.\n\nEver since I left, mom and dad are having trouble. My sister is off to college and they're alone now with all the time in the world to think about what they did. They've been to marriage counselling and according to him that has helped them see everything clearly now and see how cruel they were to me.\n\nHe says they want to start over and make up for all of it if I'm prepared to allow them. \n\n****************\n\nThis is quite shocking for me. This explains a lot about why my childhood turned out the way it did. I'm going to be honest. I wished they had given me away for adoption. I really really do. I could have been with adoptive parents who really wanted me rather than with biological parents who never did. \n\nI still don't believe that they have changed though, this can be the result of my sister (their golden child) being away and not spending as much time with them and them trying to replace her with me. I don't want to do that at all but I don't know. I've got to talk to my therapist.\n\nPlease give me your opinions again. You guys were so useful to me last time. Your help means a lot.\n   \n**tl;dr**: Dad opened up about how they wanted to put me for adoption and they couldn't find a couple to agree to separate twin sisters. That turned out to how they decided to treat me during my childhood. They say they're getting counselling and see the wrong in them and want to make up for it now.",

            "Take your time talking this out with your therapist. There's no rush and it's not like you've needed them these past 3 years.\n\n\nHere are some things you should consider as you contemplate how you will move forward:\n\n* Do you think this is more to placate their guilt or more to do right by you? Because if it's the former: *fuck em*\n\n* No matter how you look at it, their logic was *completely* fucked from the beginning and even if they say they're now understanding their mistakes, that logic will be hard for them to change and may manifest in new, more fucked up ways that you haven't seen yet.\n\n* Do you think having a relationship with them will help *you* at all? Because you're right; they're probably just sad about empty nest and see you as another way to fill the void until your sister comes back. Again, this sounds more like it benefits them with no clear benefit for you.\n\n* They still might have an ulterior motive. Maybe not your sister needing a kidney like the top comment from your OP, but something else. Be cautious.\n\nYour parents are shitty for what they did to you. I would personally never forgive them and never speak to them again, but I'm also a vengeful, hateful bastard. The thing is, though, that what your parents did **deserve** vengeful, hateful treatment. So take that for what you will.\n\nBe strong, OP. You're 10 times better than all 3 of them, no matter what happens.",
            "His explanation is honestly more painful to read than your original post.  I feel sick.\n\nThey're trying to alleviate their consciences.\n\nThere's something you must understand about the difference between accepting an apology, and giving forgiveness.  (And it doesn't even seem as if you've gotten an apology... just a request for forgiveness.)  \n\nSee, when someone genuinely feels sorry for something they did, they apologize. The intent of an apology should be to convey that one is truly sorry for their actions.  \n\nThe recipient of the apology may then decide to accept the apology if they feel the giver is truly remorseful.\n\nSometimes, though, people ask for forgiveness.  Asking for forgiveness is an inherently selfish act.  Giving an apology and having it accepted does not imply that the recipient forgives.  It just means that they acknowledge that the giver is sorry.  \n\nForgiveness is entirely up to the person who was wronged, and it is given *only* when that person is ready to give up the burden of the wrong that was committed against them and all the feelings that come with it.  It is not a gift that is given to the person who did wrong, nor is it something that that person is entitled to.  It is entirely for the benefit of the person who was wronged.\n\nYour father is asking you to forgive him.  He is not apologizing.  He is asking you to forgive your parents so that their consciences are relieved.  They are carrying guilt that will be alleviated if you forgive them and do not hold their wrongdoings against them.\n\nInstead of what you've been given, you deserve this: a genuine apology which you can decide whether or not to accept.  Then you deserve time in which you may decide whether or not you are ready to forgive.\n\nForgiveness may be given in private, or it may be shared with the people who wronged you.  You aren't obligated to tell them whether or not you have forgiven them.  It is for your benefit only.  \n\nRemember all of this as you proceed.",
            "Your parents are the kind of fucked up that doesn't fix itself in the relatively small amount of time since you've left them.\n\nI mean, Jesus fucking Christ. \"We're sorry we treated you like shit all your life, but it was because we didn't actually want you. Hell, we tried to give you away but it didn't take. You understand, yes? We're good now?\"\n\nThey may actually be dimly sorry. That won't stop them from falling into patterns that have had a lifetime to embed themselves. Your sister will always come first for them.\n\nSave yourself, cut contact, and don't go back. ",
            "They want to \"start over\" for the sake of clearing their own guilty consciences. You seem to be getting along just fine without them. I'd tell them to fuck off. ",
            "I would be cautious. They fact that they think that it's \"not fair\" to give you \"luxury\" at the cost of your sister's pain is a huge red flag.\n\nIf they want to make up their actions, at some point they will have to do exactly that: balance out the luxury and the pains. What if your sister starts throwing a tantrum at this course of action and they immediately start to backpedal and revert things back to what they were? Like other posters have said, be careful that things might have not changed, only that your parents have finally had the time to reflect on their actions. \n\nThough you'd think that if they cared about their actions being shitty they would have tried to change something years ago...",
            "OMG. How heartless of them.\n\nThey're doing it to be able to sleep at night, or their golden child is no longer the golden child.",
            "Oh fuck that. Now that you are independent and out of the house, now that you are an adult and they don't have to \"take care of you\", *now* they want a relationship with you? They made their bed, they can fucking lie in it.\n\n",
            "Wow - at least he was honest with you I guess.  But the question is still, will it make your life better with these people in your life.  My answer would be no, but you have to answer that question yourself.",
            "I would reply back with this: \n> \"Since you are used to treating me badly and feeling guilty, it would be unfair for me to take away my luxury (of never having to see you) so your pain will go away.\" ",
            "Definitely wait to talk with your therapist about this one, because hoo doggy, that is a monster pill to swallow. Basically, you could insert the first 18 years of your life into a fairy tale and no one would bat an eye if you told them it was the opening to a remake of Cinderella.\n\nThere's one thing your dad didn't answer, which was *how* he and your mom plan to make things up to you. Do they plan on giving you monetary compensation? Weekly dinners? Expensive presents on your birthday and at Christmas? Giving you a larger share of the inheritance than your sister? Honestly, that's the only reply I'd send to them at this point: \n\n\"You say you want to make up for all the years of neglect and abuse you put me through. How, exactly, do you plan to go about that?\"\n\nAnd then say nothing else until you talk to your therapist. You're right to be wary about this. They have complied with your boundaries so far, but there's no guarantee that they'll follow through with any of their promises once your sister returns home and they can dote on their Golden Child again. \n\nYour therapist may say that family counseling would be a logical next step, if you do want to go forward with building a relationship with your parents. That would be a safe environment for you, with a neutral party to keep your parents from gaslighting away all your concerns. Talk to your therapist about your sister, too. About how to reach out to your sister, if you want to open yourself up to that. She's been raised to think of you and your needs as inferior to hers, and I don't think she'll let go of that easily. But you never know.\n\nOne last thing I'll say is to not let your family members confuse \"starting over\" with \"forgetting.\" They aren't allowed to say, \"But you said we could move *past* all that! We're making an effort *now,* isn't that what matters? Stop being so dramatic!\" When something becomes part of your history, you don't get to forget it. The best you can do is learn from it. If you want this, OP, and they seem sincere, go for it. \n\nBut remember - you are under no obligation to treat any of these people like family, because they couldn't bring themselves to treat *you* like family when you needed them most. At /r/raisedbynarcissists there are two terms that I think will become familiar to you: FOO and FOC. FOO is Family of Origin, where a combination of genetic material is your only tie to those family members. FOC is Family of Choice, which is the group of people you surround yourself with who will love you and support you in seeking happiness. It's the FOC that matters, that will get you through life with a smile. \n\nGood luck, and be sure to keep us posted!",

You. \n\nI wouldn't be able to trust their intentions at this point.

That or maybe your sister hasn't been doing so \"golden\" while off at college. Well guess what, actions have consequences. You should stay away from these horrible people and don't let them feel better about themselves. If they cared for you at all, they would've treated you better.

            "Anyone who purposely neglects their own child to make their other child's life better does not deserve another chance.

You deserve so much better than a second chance with people who did not want you for the majority of your life. ",

            "You're little more than a spare part to them.  Your sister isn't around, so they have to fill the gap.  Don't think this is anything more than that.  To them, you are but a pale imitation of the original... but you'll do in a pinch.\n\nThe inadequacy, however, **is not with you**.  It is with them.  It is with their lack of character, their lack of compassion, their lack of ANY redeeming qualities.  These people are sociopaths or something... no good or decent *or mentally healthy* individual could ever do what they did to you.  It is impossible for a good person to do that.  \n\nThey are broken beyond repair.  All the therapy in the world can't heal the sickness within those two people.  \n\nYou're standing at a cusp.  Down one path is a life of good mental health.  Of good relationships, with a spouse and perhaps children.  Of healthy friendships.  Of healthy work ethics and work relationships.  A life of success and freedom and power and beauty.\n\nDown the other path is a life of therapy.  A life of failed relationships with spouses and, if you have any, damaged children.  Of friendships that are co-dependent.  Of work relationships that border on the abusive.  A life of doubt, self-loathing, abandonment issues and zero self-esteem.\n\nHow you respond to their approach is going to set you down one path or the other.  I suspect you're smart enough to know which choice leads where.  IF you let these people into your life again, they WILL revert to form as soon as your sister is back in your orbit.  And it is unlikely you will recover from that final rejection, emotionally.\n\nYou took back your power the day after your 18th birthday.  DON'T SURRENDER IT TO THEM NOW.  They cannot be trusted with your heart or your love.  They owe you YEARS of proving themselves to you... and you should not even **think** about giving them the chance to do so **until** your sister is back in their orbit so they can prove this isn't just a result of their empty nest.\n\nThe sad truth is, however, that they won't be interested in proving it at that point... because their interest in you isn't real.  It's nothing more than a desperate attempt to fill a hole your sister has left.  Once she's back?  You'll be cast aside again, more damaged than ever.\n\nDon't fall for that.  Don't let them have that from you.  Don't surrender the rest of your life to these people.  You're far better than that.  You're far better than them.\n\nThey don't deserve you, and they will NEVER be worthy of you.",

My opinion is, what could they do or possibly change themselves to make things better for you? --- What happens when your sister needs help while you try to build a relationship? Do you start getting neglected again? Is she cruel or vain enough to sabotage that? I would hate to see that happen to you. \n\nI mean you're not a kid anymore. You need to get your adult life under way and what can they even do to really help or support?

            "Wow...your *own* family treated you like a usurper or a cuckoo. As though you were stealing love from their more \"deserving\" daughter. Some people really shouldn't be parents.  \n\nYou know, you can forgive them...without actually including them in your lives. It can be as simple as \"I accept your apology. Now let's go back to the relationship we always had: none.\" \n\nMy best \"friend\" in high school bullied me throughout it. She was insecure and had a lot of her own problems, and the only way she could cope was to tear me down until I was as insecure as she was. Anyway, we had a falling out at the end of high school, and I expected to never hear from her again. 6 months ago (4 years after leaving high school), I was shocked to receive a message from her. \n\nWe started off making small-talk, then she immediately said, \"I don't want to talk about that, I want to apologise for all the shit I put you through in high school.\" And I honestly forgave her. After all, we were kids, we had no idea how to deal with our issues. I felt comfortable forgiving her.\n\nThen she offered me a friend request on facebook...and I just couldn't accept it. Even after forgiving her, I saw no reason to include her in my life. My life is full of people who *haven't* fucked me over in the past, why should I make room for her? Just because we have history? \n\nAnyway, even though we seemed to be chatting just fine, she never spoke to me again. I think that deep down, she was apologising so she could feel like a better person, and me not friending her wasn't doing that. Still, I have no regrets. \n\nSo maybe your parents want to apologise. That's fine. You can forgive them *if you want to*. They want to try again and start a new relationship. That's fine. You can do that, but *only if you want to*. You can be gracious and offer them forgiveness and a relationship with you. You can offer them forgiveness and nothing else. You can offer them neither. It's entirely up to you.\n\nPersonally, I think understanding the reasons why they were horrible parents doesn't make up for the fact that they were horrible parents. And there comes a point when really, any attempt at a relationship is Too Little, Too Late. Sure, if you want, you can now claim the parents you never had as a child...but you've survived this long without them. You might as well save your time for people who've shown that they deserve it, not people who have a LOT of making up to do. \n\nGood luck, whatever your decision. ",

And also in your mind, it's apparently not a bilateral thing, like they are treating it right now: you-parents, but a triangle you-parents-sister-you.\n\nTalk to your therapist. Take a decision that is in your own interest, that you feel good about in the end. Thinking it through will help and give you confidence.\n\nYour parents had complete power over that triangle while you grew up. Now it's falling apart, of course they panic. You are in control whether and how much contact you want to have with anyone, how you want to live your life. You need to decide whether you want to accept anything from them at all, whether it can be useful for yourself. I agree with the other poster, asking what they had in mind to \"make it up\". You are negotiating right now. If I was you, I would only accept things that I *trust* will not cause me any more anguish. It's all in your hands and you can also withdraw consent at any given time. For example, if they want to start supporting you financially, and you agree initially, but they start acting as though it entitles them to any kind of special treatment you feel uncomfortable with, you can tell them to cease payment.\n\nMaybe at some point down the line you will not feel as hurt anymore. Maybe some of their actions at some point will make you believe that the situation is different now. If you ever reach those points, you will know. Until then, keep away as well as you can from any more drama these people might cause. Protect yourself. Nurture yourself. You're doing really well.",

That's not even indulging you to make up for their shitty behaviour but just giving each you and your sister equal love and attention is too much to ask of them. I think you have your answer. Somewhere along the way between the day they had you till now, they at least acknowledged to themselves privately that what they were doing was wrong but then they *still* prioritized your sister over you because it was 'unfair.' Well frankly your parents sound like sociopaths with a lack of empathy and a fucked up philosophy on morality and fairness. ",

And likely, your parents' favouritism and disgustingly unequal treatment of the two of you will do her more lasting damage than it has done to you. She faces an uphill battle to attain the kind of independence, toughness and resourcefulness that you have. Her upbringing basically taught her that it is her god given right to have whatever she wants, with no effort on her part, and at the expense of others. This is a \"lesson\" that will die a hard and slow death in the real world. If, one day, she is reassessing her life, you will have done her a kindness by exposing the damage that your parents deliberately and callously did to *both of you* by treating one like a blessing and one like a burden.

On top of that, these were your formative years where you make your own self identity. The fact that you were even able to recognize this as (I hate to use this buzzword but..) abusive and unacceptable behavior shows that unlike them, you actually have a moral compass and empathy. They were right about one thing, you really don't fit in with that family since you're the only one who seems to have non sociopathic tendencies. It needs to be emphasized that they may have literally ruined your life, imagine how it could've been with a supportive family.  \n\n- 2.5 years of \"reform\" from them, which I question the sincerity of beyond merely a surface \"hmm maybe we shouldn't have been like that\" because they received consequences from their actions. Not because they realized it was wrong or because they suddenly developed empathy, it was because you cut them off. If their reformation had been self motivated, that would've made it mean more.\n\n- Your parents reasoning for how they treated you (both in response to that e-mail and earlier in your life while you still lived there) is a direct window into how they think. The only benefit to it is their honesty but it's an honest look into a very fucked up mindset. I stress that *this is how they operate*. Regardless of if they want to treat you better, you know that particular manner of processing information is always going to be at the helm. They can't be trusted to do the right thing in future areas. \n\n- They resented you without even knowing you just for the fact that you existed and were so weak minded that they let that color all their actions towards you for your entire life. That is inexcusable.\n\nConclusion: they're not worthy of anything from you that would allow them to feel good about themselves in any way.

But knowing what you know, I don't think there's any way you could go forward with them in a way that would be healing for you. You'll have to wonder for years if any goodwill from them after this is based in genuine kindness or guilt.

At least now I have confirmation that it wasn't my fault that I was treated this way. You decided that you didn't love me before I even left the womb. \n\nI honestly don't know how you sleep at night\".\n\nI do agree with other posters though.

It's going to go back that way. Why should you think it would be any different? That has been the status quo for 18 years of your life.\n\nI don't think this is so much them actually wanting to treat you better as it is they want to absolve themselves of any guilt. And I wouldn't put it beyond them to hold any favors they did for you against you if you decide to do something they don't want.

But they didn't count on this... they didn't count on you cutting them off for being assholes. And now they have made a new plan - they don't have to raise you anymore, so they don't have to give more to your sister, and now they feel lonely. \n\nWell la-de-fucking-da. It's too late. Fuck their plans. How the hell can two people knowingly carry out a plan like that for almost 2 decades? It boggles the mind. If I were you, I may resume some form of communication with them; but I would never ever treat them as if they were normal human beings. If you can't be strong enough to treat them like some kind of narcissist robots, then don't bother with them... they will try to break you down and play at being normal so you will love them.

This could be an opportunity for you to have your say and heal from the past further.  If it were me I don't think I could ever trust that they could truly change, and so couldn't have a relationship going forward.\n\nThere is possibly a simple test to see how much intent is behind their words.

And it bothers me how much time he's spending trying to justify it rather than apologize. If you decide to advance this relationship at all, I would really insist that they meet you for sessions with your therapist because I can see this being really painful for you. And me as a complete outsider is angry for you and I don't think you should put yourself through it. But I understand that the hope that they could be decent parents might always be there for you.

To understand that your sister not reaching out to you is 18 years of their treatment is amazing Buddhist Monk level maturity/wisdom. Don't hold your breath for her to change, but you already know that.\n\nMy opinion, since you asked, is that you focus on yourself but at the same time, recognize your father's reaching out with gratitude. Be grateful that he told you the truth... and here's the hard part... you don't have to like them (why would you?), you don't have to have a relationship with them... but you should work to forgive them.\n\nWhat? Forgive? WTF? What they did was crazy, cruel, and movie plot evil. Yes. It was.\n\nYou forgive others, not because they deserve it... but because **you deserve peace**. There's some great reading out there about this... explore... but mostly, just be you.\n\nMy opinion is to express gratitude, forgive, and then let your parents know that although you're grateful for the expression, you will reach out to them when you are ready to have a relationship.",

They all still pull the same bullshit with them, but I gave up and haven't talked to my father. I hear about his trainwreck of a life through the grapevine though. Sounds like he only got worse as he aged. The difference is, now what they WANT is different, and you pose an opportunity to get it. If they can just convince you to keep taking their abuse and bullshit, you enable them to believe they aren't bad, wrong or alone. \n\nI stopped bothering since my father was probably the worst.

Tell them that you need them to wait until you contact them. If they respect your request for no contact, then that's encouraging that them reaching out is truly about trying to make amends, since they'll be prioritizing your wishes over theirs. If they refuse to honor your request, then that tells you this is more about them appeasing their guilt.\n\nIn the mean time, talk this through with your therapist and do some soul searching. Your parents have been horrible people for 21 years. Do you really want to give them a second chance? Based on your post so far, it doesn't really sound like it, and it's absolutely understandable why. Your parents wanted to get rid of you when you were a baby and because they couldn't they've spent two decades treating you like an afterthought. Seriously? Screw them.\n\nIf you decide you do want to give them a second chance, what do YOU want out of this second beginning? Is there anything they can/should do to try and make amends - to try and even the scales after 21 years of blatantly favoring your sister? I think you're well within your rights to say, \"You want to make it up to me? Then pay off my student loans/buy me a car/whatever.\" Materialism isn't everything, of course, but after two decades of spending heaps of cash on your sister, it's fair if they put their money where their mouths are and fork some over for you. If they balk, then that tells you something, too.\n\nIf you do decide to give them a second chance, go into it with very clearly defined boundaries based on what you will/will not tolerate and explain to them explicitly if they do X, you will do Y and you will not hesitate or regret it.\n\nAnother thought - since your parents are in counseling, it might be valuable to go to a counseling session or two with them if you want to give them a second chance. It seems like they're listening to their counselor, so that counselor should hear straight from you all the crap you had to put up with - goodness knows whatever version they're telling is whitewashed.\n\nAt any rate, your parents have a literal lifetime of despicable behavior to make up for, and I think we're all behind you if you decide to peace out and let them rot.

Things aren't going well for *them, now*?  *They* should be coming to *you*.  \n\nSecondly, they should be doing their level best to be open and honest with everyone in your family, starting with your sister.  They not only mistreated you, but they've done her a great disservice by so completely skewing her perspective so badly.  The two of you never really had a relationship, which is an unforgivable thing to do to twins.

Not only that, but because of them you can't even have a relationship with your sister because they raised her to believe she was superior to you in every way, and because of their abandonment even your extended relatives to not see you as an equal to your sister.

You may not have had the best life as a kid, but you can be sure that you will have a great life as a parent to your kids. ",
            "Wow. Just wow. Of all the possible reasons I had considered to explain their behaviour, I never came close to this one.\n\nYou're justified in feeling upset. Take as much time as you need to mull over this one. If you're feeling magnanimous, sure, give them a chance... but just ONE CHANCE. But watch them carefully, and especially take note of their behaviour towards you and your sister if she ever comes back to live, etc. If they start sliding back to their previous behaviour patterns, leave. At that point you can say you've tried, but the fallout rested on them.\n\nA lot of people here would advise you to leave once and for all and never look back. Their reaction is understandable; they're upset for you. But the decision's ultimately yours. After all, you only have one life to live; if you don't take the olive branch being extended here, do you think you'll be wondering \"what if\" 10, 20 years down the road as your parents slip into old age and as you reflect on your life?\n\nI think it's abhorrent what your parents did during your birth, childhood, and teenage years. But there is a chance they're genuinely remorseful now. Two things led me to this conclusion - the fact that they went to counselling might've finally opened their eyes, and the fact that your father finally gave you the ugly but straight answer to explain their previous behaviour. Admitting this must've been hard, especially given that they're trying to build a relationship with you again and so this confession would've been a risky move for them, but by admitting what they did, they did demonstrate that they respected you enough to come clean. And after all, if you do give them a chance, you can still walk away if they demonstrate that they truly haven't changed in their core, that this repentant behaviour only stemmed from them missing your sister, etc. They won't be able to hide their true colours for long.",
            "You know the greatest thing you can do if you want to slight them?  Get along with your sister.  Yeah she may be spoiled, but you may have issues in regarding to her getting preferential treatment.  \n\nI am also a twin, but my twin brother has Asperger's syndrome.  As a result my parents were forced to do much more for him than for me.  The punishments that I received were a lot worse than what he received (because I should have known better) and I eventually lost my best friend in high school because I was grounded for three years for leaving a dance to go to burger king.  Unlike you when I confronted my parents when I left for university, they saw the mistakes they made and started to support me more. \n\nSo my experience would say to give them a chance, but there is absolutely some animosity between you and your sister.  I would repair your relationship with your sister before your parents. If you're parents mistreat you again, you could go to your sister for help, and she will be able to do something.",

They robbed you of a childhood, they can at the very least give you some form of being an adult. \n\nHonestly despite all this you seemed to turn out well, with pretty decent morals and a nice personality, an understanding of right and wrong is very important in my personal views.

Can you be happy without them, or do you feel there is a need to bring them into your life?\n\nA relationship with them now has much different dynamics than when you were growing up (i.e. you are grown up now, you can handle and take care of yourself). Now they want you at a point where it is easy, i.e. you're an adult too. \n\nTo me it sounds sort of like getting a dog (sorry if it sounds bad/inhumane as to how they are treating you, but thats what it seems). I am the younger of 2, my parents are fine, we all get along fine. Basically brother moved out, then I was at that point, so they decided to get a dog.

They have to come to YOU.\n\nAnd you don't have to call them or see them or have any interaction with them until you are good and ready.  \n\nYou may never be ready.\n\nI moved out when I was 17.  My childhood wasn't quite as terrible as yours, but it wasn't good.  I tried to keep a relationship for years, but the realization that it's a 2 way street - that THEY need to put in some effort - well, we have 1 phone call every 2 weeks for about 15 minutes.  I do see them at Christmastime, because they live on the beach and it's a short beach vacation, and I don't stay at their house. \n\nFortunately, my brother saw the inequity in our relationship with our parents and has really worked hard to have a good relationship with me.  He's a good guy.  Your sister may yet come around.\n\nIf you ever do eventually decide to have a relationship with your parents, you will need strong boundaries around them.\n\nOne of the healthiest things I ever did was move several thousand miles away.  \n\nTake care of yourself.

I personally would keep an arms length relationship with them and gradually allow them to get closer if they earn it and don't revert back to old behaviors, but you would also be rational if you decided you rather would not have them in your life anymore, since maybe they are just trying to make themselves feel better with all of this.\n\nYou matter, I'm so sorry they didn't realize that when you needed it most.",

Tell them, if they do this for you, they may attend your graduation and take you out to celebrate in person.  If they truly have realized what they did is wrong, they will jump at the chance to do this for you.\n\nThey probably won't, but I don't see the harm in making the proposal.",

Don't become your parents out of anger.",

You haven't been just robbed of parents--you've been robbed of one of the rarest and most special relationships people can have. Combine that with being Cinderella-level evil stepparents to THEIR OWN DAUGHTER, and yeah, in my book they're the worst of the worst.\n\nIf there is going to be any recovery, the parents have to really grasp and repent of the unbelievable evil they have committed. Maybe they should see your therapist with you. I don't know, maybe if they can see the damage they have done, grapple with it, and try to repent of it, it might get you some closure.",
            "I think the main thing here is that you know your parents only look out for themselves.

They probably feel at least a little bit like they are still doing you a favor by reaching out to you. \n\nIf I were you I would never look back. They had their chance to be good parents, and they chose to be neglectful and psychologically abusive overgrown children. Not only that, but they got the rest of your childish, abusive, family to play along. YOU are the adult in this situation. You are the best your family has to offer. \n\nIf it brings you peace of mind, by all means stay in contact with them. But only do it for yourself.

Where as you cut them off and did this all on your own for 3 years with 0 help from them.

            "I'm going to share my very limited opinion as a father of a set of twins that are 11 weeks old. I couldn't even imagine how I would react if one of my babies were ever taken from me. I love them each as much as I can in their own special ways for all the hundreds of reasons that make them different and special. \n\nRaising them is proving to be very hard on my wife and I, but I'm 100% sure that we'll get through it. We constantly talk about the future and how we'll do Daddy Daughter dates and Mother Son outings and vice versa. We talk about making sure not to compare them in front of each other and to help nurture and encourage them to grow and develop in their own ways. We talk about who in the family they'll look like and which one will act like me or her. \n\nI can tell you fully that when I saw 2 heart beats at the first visit I was over the moon. I high fived the doctor and tried to high five my very shocked soon to be very pregnant wife. Eventually reality sunk in a bit that we'd be having twins and everything was going to cost way more than we had planned for. Then I figured that there are twins born every day to families with means way less than ours and they may scrimp and struggle, but they get by. Not only do they get by, but they raise beautiful children that are exploring and experiencing the world we show them every day. After thinking on it for 30 weeks I knew we'd be just fine no matter what. \n\nNow please take the rest of this from my experience as a person raised exclusively by a narcissistic mother. What your parents did isn't something that you can just reason naturally into doing. There is something that is inside them that is different from other people to be able to even consider giving one of their twins away. You hit it dead on with your comment on adopters not wanting to break you up. It's completely unconscionable. If they were at the point of deciding by looking at your eye colors you were at least 10-14 weeks old, babies eyes are usually gray until then. By 8 weeks old my twins had clearly formed a bond with each other outside the womb. If ones crying and the other starts to they'd sync up their crying and then wait and listen for the other one to start again. They'd reach out for each other in the pack and play. They'd look at each other when we were each holding one. You'd have to kill me before I ever separated them from each other and I'll be damned if one of them ever thinks they're better than the other. A twin bond is a lifetime best friendship that comes easily and naturally to twins by way of growing and learning together. The way your parents poisoned that is despicable and completely cruel. This was not a learned behavior for them and it clearly came naturally for them to be able to do it since birth. \n\nI'm truly sorry for what you were put through, but the only thing I can  suggest is moving on and living well. Become your own person outside of their definition of you. Leave that door open for your twin and take it slowly when she's ready to walk through it. Having a twin seems like one of the best things in the world and I don't think its too late for you to experience that. Hope some of this helps a little. ",
            "What crappy people.  I'd thank him for him being honest at least.  Having that question answered will help your therapy and your recovery from being the black sheep.\n\nMy gut says you'll only get hurt again if you give them another chance.  I'm not in a place to talk though because I gave my dad another chance however it's limited contact and only on my terms.  In my case though my dad treated us kids pretty good until he remarried so at least I had some memories of my dad treating me well.  If my dad had been a cruel jerk from birth, I definitely would never see him again.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see what your therapist says to this.  I too am sorry that the adoption fell through because you deserved caring parents who treated you with love!  \n\nIf you ever have kids, don't worry... you won't be at all like your parents.  In some ways when I became a parent I got even angrier at my parents because treating my kids the way my parents treated me was unthinkable and that lowered the possible justification that it was how they were raised and they couldn't help themselves or they didn't know any better.\n\n\n",

It is nice that he was honest and detailed with you.  In a small way it is nice to see that they have a conscience and want to mend things.  But is it really for your good or for their own good?  I don't feel it is going to change anything or make up for the 18 years that you have been unhappy.  From the sound of your posts, I think you're still too angry to give mending a shot.  Maybe an alternative is to keep communication open but don't meet up with them.  I am doing the same thing with my stepmom that I never got along with.  She seems to be reaching out too.  However, I know I won't ever be buddy buddy with her but I am happy to just say hi, ask how things are doing, and stay civil for the sake of my dad and my siblings.  I know you don't have anyone in the family to really maintain contact with but I think the alternative open communication/no visits might be a good compromise if deep down you have any interest in maintaining a family connection.\n\nGood luck to you and I hope you can continue to give us an update.

            "I was going to say something about your parents being fucked up monsters, but other people here have already said it better.  It's funny though, I also feel sorry for your sister.\n\nMy cousin, we'll call her Princess Bitchface, was raised kind of like your sister was - her parents believed in being tough on boys and soft on girls, so they showered her in attention, gifts and love.  At the same time her little brother, who we'll call Little Bro, was pushed to work hard, was shamed for not being number one in everything and actually got an four page \"advice letter\" for his 13th birthday, which was basically one long criticism of how shitty a son he was.  (Holy shit did my dad tear his brother a new one when he saw the letter.  My dad got him a bike that year.)\n\nAs an adult, Little Bro moved to the other side of the country and calls his parents two or three times a year for a five minute call, and hasn't seen them in a decade (he's spent several of Christmas vacations with us or other family though).  Meanwhile Princess Bitchface, now aged 35, is still completely financially and emotionally dependent on them.  She flunked out of university twice (but no student loans because of course her parents paid for everything, while Little Bro graduated with something like $60,000 in debt), she can't keep a job, can't maintain a stable relationship and never really developed any skills to cope with the adult world.  Every couple of years she seems to end up getting suckered into another pyramid scheme - Scentsy, MonaVie etc etc - and then pouts on Facebook when no one wants to buy her bullshit products or become one of her \"distributors\".  Her parents lose a bunch of money, and she goes and finds some other waste of time.  Being a princess all your life is brutal when you discover you're not actually a princess.  Now that she's in her mid thirties and her looks are starting to go (she doesn't take care of herself very well), she's becoming really insufferable.\n\nWe were recently planning a big family trip with lots of extended family, and there was all kinds of drama because we didn't want to invite Princess Bitchface or her parents.  When she's around, there's always a meltdown or a huge fight or something, and it just makes it stressful to have her around.  And because she doesn't have any money, people always need to \"treat her\".  (The worst was three years ago when my sister was hanging around with Princess Bitchface around Christmas time, and they went shopping.  My sister bought herself this cool jacket, and Princess Bitchface threw a tantrum when my sister wouldn't \"loan\" her the money to buy one too.  Her parents angrily called my parents to demand an apology and suggest that my sister should buy Bitchface a jacket to show that her apology was sincere.  My dad laughed so hard he dropped the phone.)\n\nMy grandma lives in this fantasy world where we can all just get along, but the short version is that my uncle and aunt are horrible people, they raised a horrible daughter, but by the grace of pushing him away and being gigantic assholes, their son is actually a great guy.  No one wants them or Princess Bitchface around, but their son is welcome any time, and we see him as often as we can.\n\nIn the end the trip didn't happen, and part of the reason was that no one wanted to have Princess Bitchface around.\n\nMaybe none of this is what's in store for your sister, and maybe she's a perfectly delightful young lady with a bright future ahead of her, and being raised the way she was will have no long term detrimental effect on her at all.

            "Personally, OP, I would not forgive them. They dug their grave for two decades . To forgive them is to alleviate their guilt. You must be strong and not give in to their crocodile tears. I would forward the email your father sent you to your sister. Then I would disown the three of them completely. It is ultimately your choice but after reading the horrible upbringing you had to endure there is no reconciliation. They're narcissists who simply want to repair their damaged egos. Please, for the sake of your emotional and mental wellbeing do not forgive these monsters. They do not deserve an iota of your forgiveness. To be honest: if you still have facebook with all your extended family and relatives I would post the entire exchange between you and your father and say this is the truth. No bullshit, no sob story. Simply explain that cruelty on that level is unforgivable. Crush them, OP. Make them rue the day they decided to try and snare you back into their sociopathic tentacles. I wish the best for you, truly. I'm so sorry it had to be this way. ",
            "First off, your parents seem like horrible people. That is definitely the consensus, anyone with a brain can figure this out. BUT if they *truly* mean that they want to make it up to you, I would personally try to repair the relationship. But this is only because I love my parents more than anything. If it's too hard for you, then please don't put yourself through the repair. I just believe that if you can come to a common ground with your parents, you will come out of it with a little more love in your life. Your dad being honest with you was incredibly brave, because what they did is so vile he knew the possible consequences of revealing their \"secret\" to you. It sounds as if they really want a fresh start. You may never fully trust them, but you may regret never at least trying when you had the chance.",
            "Honestly If I were in your shoes, I'd tell my dad to go fuck himself. He fucked up for 18 years and once again, he only wants to reconnect to absolve HIMSELF of guilty; not to make YOU feel better.",
            "They are cruel, cold, heartless people. They never gave a duck about you, and they never will. If they were able to be that unfair, unjust, mean, hurtful, toxic to you **WHILE KNOWING IT** then they are monsters and I don't think you owe them a second thought. They should spend the rest of their life (and then some) contemplating their own ugliness and drowning in the guilt of what they put you through.\n\nI say fudge'em. Go NC and never look back. You deserve so much better. Let them rot in their guilt.",
            "Your decision to reconnect with them (or not) needs to be based on what is best for you, not them. What are the benefits of having a relationship with them? It's ok to want to be connected to your parents. It's also ok not to want to be, and you have every reason not to want to.\n\nWhat they did was fucking horrible and you didn't deserve it. That doesn't mean that people don't gain insight into the terrible mistakes they make and can't be better people. But you said it yourself - the timing of this request is suspect. \n\nIf you decide you want to start over with them, I strongly suggest doing it incrementally and ONLY on your terms. Make them prove it to you. The next step should be an apology and an explanation from your mother. They want to be part of your life? They have to goddamn well earn it. \n\nI'm so glad that you have a therapist. Listen to their guidance on this. ",
            "I did not see your first post originally (I went back and read it). I am so sorry for all you've been through. That is just incredibly hard. \n\nI only have one thing to say and it may have been said by others already. I don't know. \n\nTo some degree, forgiveness is often just as much about your healing as it is about them.  It doesn't even mean you have to have a relationship with them. It can be about letting go of resentment or hate or any other strong negative emotion and not letting that past affect your life. And maybe forgiveness isn't even the right word. I don't know. My wife (W) and her brother (BIL) had a pretty verbally/emotionally (and once or twice physically) father. Neither of them have contact with their father, but BIL still carries around so much resentment and even hate with him. It truly does affect his life now. Now granted, he did get more of the abuse and the father-son releationship is different, but it makes my wife and I sad for him. \n\nThat is my two cents. Knowing why and having a few conversations with them (if you chose to do so) could be another step in your healing. But it doesn't mean you have to have a relationship anymore or allow them to hurt you more. ",
            "I'd have a hard time replying to them anything other than \"You have shit for brains. Never contact me again.\". Seriously, they can live with what they did. I don't see how you'd benefit from trying to patch things up, they can't undo the damage they did to you and you will probably be better off keeping your distance and building your own life away from their dysfunction. It's too late now, and I wouldn't trust them to actually make progress, why invest yourself emotionally again in people who are capable of such an atrocity?",
            "I would not trust at all that they have been able to change in any meaningful way in just 3 years.\n\nWatch out for the 18 years of patterns they have developed. It will likely feel very foreign to them to suddenly have to treat you as an equal and every time they slip up it will hurt you and you'll wonder if you should point it out or endure it a little longer hoping it will get better in time.\n\nThis can make for years of you getting big and small stabs of pain as you try to build a relationship to them and hope they can turn into some semblance of decent parents.\n\nAnd all the while, you may need therapy to deal with their abuse. And it will affect your life and that of your husband and any children you have.\n\nAnd not to be glum, but after trying hard for 15 years, you may end up realizing your parents can really never change and be any better and that the best you can hope for is a strained relationship that gives you no joy. And then you may realize how much energy that took away from your life with your husband and kids...\n\nI obviously cannot say what to do - it is up to you to make that decision with input from people you trust.",

            "Hi there. You've probably been pointed to the raisedbynarcissists sub a few times already, but we'd love to talk to you there and share stories. Relationships doesn't like links, so I'm going to leave it to you to add the slashes and r's!\n\nLet me share my perspective with you. I didn't have a twin, but my parents were hateful and cruel to me growing up in their own ways. I have reason to believe that both of my parents are mentally ill, but neither was ever diagnosed or received any treatment. My father was a deeply religious man and didn't believe in psychology. \n\nI moved out six months after I turned 18, having fantasized for years about running away. I know I would be a more well-adjusted person today if I'd been raised by my grandparents or by adoptive parents, but my parents actually wanted me so that I could feed them the unconditional love of a child. \n\nI remained in contact with them for over 10 years, and they continued to poison me at every turn. I finally cut all ties 3 years ago and have had no contact since.\n\nI feel badly about it sometimes. Children are supposed to love and care for their parents, we're told. I spoke to my therapist about it and she helped me to understand that my own happiness and mental well-being is the most important thing I should focus on, and that rekindling a relationship with my parents will only hurt that. \n\nSo the question you need to ask yourself is, will it help you? Are you able to forgive them and try to start fresh? **There is absolutely nothing wrong with a \"yes,\" a \"no,\" or an \"I'm not sure.** \n\nI think right now, the best thing you can do for yourself is to take some time to process this new information. Let your dad know that you appreciate him finally being honest with you, and that you really need some time to think about what he's said. Ask him not to press you or hound you. Tell him that if he cannot respect your wishes, then your decision will be made much faster, and it won't be one that he likes. \n\nTake all the time you need. I'd guess you'll need at least a couple of months to sort out how you feel about this. Write down your thoughts. It helps to process them, and it can be useful to have all your thoughts in one place to look at when you're feeling confused. \n\nThen, when your decision is made, let him know what you've decided and why. Don't do this for them, but for yourself. \n\nGood luck, and I hope to see you on RBN. We may not know exactly how you feel, but we can sympathize with having shitty parents who suddenly want to make up. ",
            "Your parents sound like self absorbed sociopaths. I would not allow them back into your life now. You seem like you are doing well without them in your life, why rock the boat. I say give them and yourself more time and space apart and then consider coming back together in a few years. Time tends to be the best remedy for things like this I think so yeah.",
            "Dear OP,\n\nMy situation was never as bad as yours, but I've been in your shoes. While there was no physical difference between me and my brother, he was always the smarter one, and the more studious, which my father extremely prides in him. My parents now pay for my brother to go to MIT, while I attend a community college and I'm paying it from my own pocket. During my childhood my father never asked me about my social life, or what parties I had gone too. The only thing he demanded from me was a report card. That was the most interaction I had with him. However, he would always eagerly talk with my brother and ask about how his friends were doing and if he needed any advice on anything. Thankfully my mother is a saint. She never treated my brother or I differently, so I still speak with her and respect her very much. \n\n\nWhen I finished highschool, I did the same thing as you, I left and only answered phone calls from my mother and my brother. I refused to speak with my father. I have been home a few times for Christmas, but I only exchange small talk with my father. He did reach a breaking point and he broke down on one Christmas dinner telling me that he loved me and asked why I left and refused to talk to him. All I had to do was ask him to name a single friend of mine or a single hobby I had. He had no idea, and pretty soon he realized the error of his ways. He's been asking me for a \"second chance\" ever since, but in my opinion, he had 18 years of second chances. The whole notion of a second chance is complete bullshit when the opportunity for a second chance has been there for years. There is nothing forgivable about that. \n\nMy suggestion is that you go find closure. Go talk with your parents, get the entire story from them (mom might have other things to say), but DO NOT give them a \"second chance\". They need to understand that this is real life, not the fucking sims. Their actions have consequences, and the fact that they raised two children with the mentality of children themselves is ridiculous. Please I beg you OP, don't succumb to them just because they put on a nice smile and they shed a few tears. Go meet them, get all the closure you need, and them get the hell out of there. As far as your sister, she has done nothing wrong. While she could have stuck up for you, she was still a child, and I do not believe she can be held accountable. Good luck OP",
            "I'm so sorry OP, my heart breaks for you. I'm a twin myself, and I probably wasn't as successful as my brother at a lot of things growing up, but my parents never loved us any differently. Reading this made me feel so upset. ",
            "I would just burn the bridge. There is no relationship in this world too sacred to excuse yourself from. Not blood, not marriage, not love. If someone was awful to you, don't bother with them. That's how I feel anyways.",
            "They want two things from re-establishing contact from you. First, they want to make themselves feel better, because if they can get you to start over with them they will feel like they've been absolved of all the shit they put you through. The second reason they want to reconnect with you is that you're an adult now. Not only do they not have to spend any of their money on you, they're opening an avenue for you to help them financially down the road. Because as you get older the only people you can really rely on for help are your children. You should not reconnect with them. They are fucking awful people. You're out, you have a life, you do not need to a part of that mess. I mean, if they had cared at all about you they would have put you in foster care rather treat you the way they did. At least in foster care there would a chance you got into a loving home with people who would care about you. With them you never had that chance. And now they're trying to take advantage of you again. ",
            "> He said that deep inside they always knew what they were doing was wrong but they could never step up and do the right thing during this 18 years.  Why not? They thought that changing the dynamic would negatively affect my sister as she's now used to being offered more time and resources and I'm used to not getting it, so making it more equal would be a luxury for me and a pain for her. They thought that's not fair for my sister to be in pain for the sake of my luxury.\n\nThere is a lie in this paragraph somewhere.  They *could* have stepped up but they didn't.  And the logic he gives afterward is an explanation, not of why they \"couldn't\" step up, but of why what they were doing wasn't *wrong*.\n\nPersonally I don't believe they weighed the idea of changing their treatment of you.  I think they resented you, in some misplaced way, for spoiling their vision of having a single child, and because of that they treated you poorly.  And whenever they felt guilty about it, they rationalized it.  They thought \"oh, she's used to it, it's okay to keep acting this way.\"  And separately, whenever there was something excessive they were considering doing for your sister, they did that for her because they didn't resent her.\nPut another way, they didn't give a fuck if what they were doing was wrong.\n\nI honestly don't think there's much for you to gain in continuing to talk to them.  But I think if you were to try, I might start something like this:\n\n\"So what you're telling me is, you didn't love me and you didn't want me.  Do you have any idea what it feels like to be told that?  And it's not like you love me now.  If you loved me now you would think about me and my feelings.  \n\nAll I can see that's in it for me with this \"new start\" is to be reminded, over and over again, that you never wanted me and you never loved me.  I've been working with a therapist for years to NOT have that in the forefront of my mind all the time.  \n\nSeeing that you feel guilty about it now means absolutely nothing to me.  You kicked me for years, what do I care if your toe hurts?  \n\nSo if you can see something in this for me besides pain, please let me know what it is.\"\n\n",
            "This is to satr their guilty conscience through.and through. The only reason they feel bad now is becasue they have free time to think, get them a hobby and theyll forget all about it ",
            "They most likely realize they are getting on in age and Golden Child sister likely doesn't have much to do with them now. They're probably afraid no one will take care of them, so what better time to kiss and make up? And what's more, their marriage is in peril so they may not even want to take care of each other. This just screams of \"please come back, I still need to use you\". OP, it is entirely up to you if you want them in your life or not, and you know better than we do, but if I were in your shoes I would abandon them to their own devices just as they did with you. ",

            "I know there are hundreds of comments here, OP, but here's my 2 cents. \n\nHonestly, the reason why they treated you and your sister differently is so messed up. If I were you, I don't think I could forgive them of that, regardless of anything else. I mean, even if they seemed remorseful and sincere in their approach to reconciling with you, that honestly wouldn't be \"good enough\" for me if I were you. I agree with other people saying talk to your therapist. However, they're your parents and you know them better than anyone, though. Go with your gut and take some time to process things.

            "It sounds as though your father contacted you alone. Your parents are not presenting themselves as united in their apology, which makes me wonder if your mother is sorry or just wants to \"forget the whole thing happened\" (that they abused and neglected you for absolutely no justifiable reason). It even seems as though he's not sorry, but that he's only reaching out to save his marriage - possibly at his therapist's suggestion. But these people don't deserve their marriage. They don't deserve happiness in their lives. All that's owed to them is the scorn of their community, and the rest of their lives to wither in isolation and loathing and the moral bankruptcy they created. But that's my thought. What matters more is your thoughts.\n\nFrom the tone of your post, you don't seem to want them in your life.

Spending the time after family visits talking with therapists about the feelings it triggered and how to unravel them. Looking them in the eyes and now knowing their true feelings about you, being reminded that they did not love you. \n\nYou don't deserve that any more than you deserved what was inflicted upon you.\n\nIt is your decision. The door is there, but you don't need to open it now. You can tell your father that you will contact them \"when you are ready\" - on your terms, when you feel stable and secure and able to process. You can tell him to fuck off and nobody would ever judge you. You can tell him how and where you'll meet and give conditions and work with your parents to have a future, but only if you want that.

I think that whatever you end up doing and however you feel right now, you should take some time before deciding anything.\n\nI know that in light of everything they did to you, just being honest about why they did it isn't a huge thing, but it's still a start. It can't have been easy for your parents to admit all of this, but they did, so maybe that's a sign that they're willing to fix things (or improve them at least; I don't know that they can be fixed). \n\nOne thing I would definitely do is ask them to compensate you in some reasonable way financially for everything your sister got that you didn't. That's something that seems completely reasonable to demand. I have an older brother, and both of us always got everything we needed and more, but my mum sat me down the other day and had a serious conversation with me about how they kept tabs on how much they spent on him and how much they spent on me, and apparently they spent quite a bit more on him (I wouldn't have known and also don't care), and she said that they'll definitely compensate me for that, that depending on how we both continue with our lives (we're both in very different situations and live in different countries), they'll buy me a car (he has one, I haven't needed one) or stuff like that or at some point just give me an adequate amount of money. I've always had everything I needed, this isn't something I particularly care about or I want, but it's something my parents care about, and other parents they've discussed this with, and I talked to a friend of mine about this who's in a similar situation and his parents said the same to him. So this is something you should definitely ask for. It's something reasonable parents do. If they aren't willing to do that (and I'm not even saying right away, not sure what their financial situation is like), then they aren't serious about this. If they give you money, but things afterwards don't work out, you'll still be better off than now. It's also something you shouldn't feel bad about because they owe you so much from your childhood, so I'd definitely take that money if you can get it, even if you think you want to break off contact again.\n\nFrom that point, I'd basically just see how they deal with everything. You shouldn't try and let them guilt you into anything (donating a kidney or whatever people speculated on the old thread), you shouldn't offer them anything and you shouldn't do anything from your side for a while. If they want to invite you for dinner, I'd go if I was you, but I'd be prepared to nope out of there any second if they say/do something shitty. Even if things seem to work out, don't get too attached for a while (not that it sounds like there's much of a risk, but still). Be aware that this may be a temporary thing. Let them make all the effort to improve your relationship. Don't block their efforts, but don't invest anything (time, emotion etc) until you see that they're serious and it's working out. \n\nAnyway, that was a lot of rambling.\n\ntldr: I'd give them a chance, though I wouldn't put any effort into the relationship and let them do everything, but first thing you should do is ask for some money to compensate everything your sister got and you didn't.

            "They are greedy selfish people that want to make their pain and conscious go away, not parents that made a mistake and want to make it up to you. ",
            "/r/relationships is always gonna recommend you cut contact. That's just how this subreddit is.  I'm going to be more pragmatic for this issue.  \n\nLet's assume the worst and say they are doing this just to clear their guilty conscience.  Does OP still stand to gain anything?  Probably financially a good amount.  Does OP stand to lose anything?  Nothing if she is able to keep herself emotionally detached from them and play along.  \n\nI say be as heartless as they were to you and milk them for everything you can get.  If you are enough of a sociopath to be able to pull it off without emotional harm to yourself, do it.\n\nAlternatively if you think they genuinely want to reconcile, it might be in your best interests emotionally to do so even if they don't deserve it.  \n\nJust 2 different ways to look at it.\n",
            "I would literally murder them after that message and have a clear conscience afterwards",
            "You can go one of two ways, you can cut them off completely, living a good happy life (you may have had a shitty start but you can and I'm sure you have a happy time from here on now!) This will cause them pain by not getting closure. You could go the other way and milk them. Tell them that they will pay your college tuition fees (or whatever you want to do), you'll have a new car, a house whatever but they WILL provide if they want to make it up to you. You don't have to care about these \"people\", just make sure you're happy and if you can elicit either emotional or financial revenge, then why not!",
            "I would say do whatever makes YOU happy and sane and feel good. \n\nIf you're going on feeling guilty about what \"your parents are going through\" remember they made the conscious decision to treat you lesser-than. \n\nIf it were me I would not want a relationship. They had 18 years to realize how awful they were, now all of a sudden they want what other parents work and sacrifice years to attain: the love and respect of their child. \n\nIf this is something you feel like you need to do, then you're the best person to decide that. But are they reaching out to you because they realized they've hurt you badly, or are they hoping you'll alleviate some guilt so they can go on being the happy little three person family they were? \n\nYou're an adult. You get to choose the people who are in your life now. Choose (or don't choose) well, and that includes your 'parents' \n\nEdit: also if you're in the LA area I'd be happy to buy you a drink and have some girl talk about unbelievably selfish parents. ",
            "i would reply and say that you appreciate his honesty and that you think he and your mother should continue therapy and you hope it helps them.  Be honest in return and say that you can see they only want you now as a replacement for your absent sister, imagine you did rebuild with them and then you had to see your sister worshipped and spoiled every family function etc. \r\nNormally I say build bridges but here all they deserve from you is a modicum of politeness in saying no thankyou, i'm not a backup to your favourite child.",
            "I really don't see any reason why you should give them another chance. They had 21 years to treat you like a human being and only now they are realising they messed up?\n\nThey sound like horrible people who are having a bit of an attack of the conscience and trying to make themselves feel better about it. I really don't think you need them in your life. Find people who aren't so incredibly shitty, selfish and shallow, and spend time with them instead.",
            "Fucking hell, that's really awful. I'm so sorry. To think that because they'd only wanted one child, they figured that NOT dumping you in foster care was a favor, and that any scrap of attention they gave you beyond that was somehow at the expense of your sister. When all along you were every bit as much their child as she was. I can't get my head around that. \n\nI'm just an internet stranger, but my first thought is, to hell with them, let them sit with whatever guilt they allegedly feel while their golden child carries on her own happy life oblivious to their supposed pain. \n\nI wonder if your sister has avoided you out of guilt. Does she know this whole story? Maybe they've told her and she's turned on them in disgust. It's possible they've alienated her and that they need a substitute. Which would make them cold-blooded assholes, but no surprise there. Maybe two questions to ask are, Does my sister know? and What made you realize that what you did was wrong? But only if you're curious. They may have some half-baked idea that they can make this up to you, but they had your whole childhood to repent and reform, and they didn't. You needed them then and they weren't there. You DON'T need them now. ",
            "Well, that's a doozy...\n\nI can only echo what most other people have said already: This admission, while brutally honest, still makes it sound like they're more interested in alleviating their own guilt than actually making amends and building a healthy relationship with you (how in the world could they, even?)\n\nOf course, you know them better than any of us, so only you can judge how sincere they may be and whether or not they possess the capacity for real change, or if they just want you as hobby now that your sister is out of the house. \n\nKnowing what you do now, what you do feel like you have to gain by letting them back into your life? If you do meet with them, are you emotionally sound enough to withstand the very real possibility of being cast aside again? \n\nI wouldn't even call these people parents. Of all the things that are true, you certainly do not owe them anything. My opinion is shut them down definitively, but not vengefully (never does any good). Just tell him thank you for finally being honest, and in return you'll give them what they've always wanted: you're not their daughter anymore. ",
            "I think it's best to exchange any minute with them... and every minute they get, because it's something you want for yourself too. It's still an exchange, but.. it's a give and take. Listen to yourself, take your time let it clear (as time does) when logic and emotion agree it's when you're best to act.\n\nIf you're done aside from a few questions and insights, allow yourself that. \n\nBe true to you, even if you vacillate, etc... just take each step towards or away of your own free will. Your strength. Your needs, not by what they give you but what you want to give to yourself with them only being an extension to it if you want.\n\nYou don't have to do anything, offer or decline anything, until you feel sure. Just give time and trust yourself.",
            "Much like everyone else said, they only want their guilt to be reduced, not to become a happy family, this is too late.",
            "No one would blame you for not wanting to be around them again.\nThey were awful and they have no idea how to handle the two of you together.\nI'm so sorry that your parents have been such awful human beings....and awful still cannot describe how truly despicable it is, what they have done.\n\nIf you think this is good for you, do it, but I just do not believe they can be changed people when their logic is so royally fucked. \nIt's too fucked up to comprehend and I believe they are fucked up in other ways as well that will very quickly come to light. ",
            "What total cunts. ",
            "With family it is always a challenge to choose how much contact you want with someone who is toxic.  I have a sister that I, and pretty much the whole family, avoids.  She's mentally ill and makes every event she attends anxious and unpleasant.  It isn't obvious either.  She has untreated borderline personality disorder.  Her outbursts make all of us uncomfortable.  Not that my relationship to her compares to the shit storm you've been though but she's older than I am and we have a long history of her fucking over the rest of us in various ways through the years going back to when we were children. Anyway, my point is, do I cut her out of my life?  It is easy to avoid her because she lives in a different city but I do see her at family reunions.  Our decision is to have as little to do with her as possible.  We avoid giving her opportunities to act out.  Completely cutting yourself off from blood is a huge decision and not to be taken lightly.  You are wise to go to a therapist to wrap your mind around this. To be healthy and whole you'll need to find a way to let go of your anger and resentment, independent of whether you try to have a relationship with your family. As for if you try to renew your relationship with them, at the very least your Dad did tell you why.  You may never completely mend this rift but to not try may haunt you.  Like the old proverb says, 'Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.'  Finally, I'd like to say you sound like an amazing and resilient person.  Despite this horrible treatment you've got an incredible spirit.  Regardless of how things go down with your family, you're going to be fine.  I'm sure of that.",
            "Wow. I guess it is a good thing he was honest? \n\nDon't see them again .These people weren't your parents, they were just your legal guardians.\n\nAs adults we make our on families through those we let into our lives and our friends. Go make your *real* family. ",
            "Me personally, I would say fuck it and never talk to them again. Let them realize how fucked up their behavior was and NEVER talk to them EVER. ",
            "OP, I couldn't live with that answer and have a relationship with them, but I don't blame you if you want to try.  I would be concerned that they are still obsessed with themselves assuaging their own guilt rather than really being interested in you.  I wouldn't reinitiate contact without speaking privately to their therapist...They could waive confidentiality.\n\nI think you can build a real family who will welcome you with open arms.  It might be friends, it might be a SO, it might be SO's parents.",
            "I really have nothing to offer except to say that a) I think you are getting good advice and support here, b) I'm glad that you are going to talk with your therapist, c) I'm so terribly sorry that this has been your life story, but you are still quite young and I'm glad that you will get to write the rest of your life story on your own terms. Best of luck, OP. I think you are so brave and strong.",
            "Really sorry that the bad keeps getting worse.  In life we often have people who wrong us, but we make value judgements to decide if that person who wronged us can provide value to our lives or if they only detract.  Only you can decide if your parents give you more value than they take, and it seems like you have already figured that out long ago.  \n\nA lot of people are telling you to write back, say this or that.  If they have no value to you any more, rightfully so, don't respond to him at all and cut contact completely.  There is no reason to let them know you are upset or doing well or doing poorly, its none of their business.  Anything you say to them can be construed to either give them solace or apathy, silence makes them remain in the dark with no reprieve for their withering souls.\n\nI am really sorry this happened to you.  My wife is pregnant now and we think she may have twins.  I myself am a twin and could never imagine in my worst nightmare how this must have felt.  I think to my future and the love I already have for my unborn child/ren, I could never imagine not loving each one of them with all my heart.\n\n",
            "It would be interesting for your parents to tell this exact same thing to your sister (or for you to forward his email to her). I know that sounds like pot stirring, but I bet it would do a lot to help heal the relationship between you and your sister. She would see in black and white that you absolutely were treated worse than her - and *on purpose*.",
            "They may actually want to form a real relationship with you. It is possible. Seeing a therapist is a good sign for that. \n\nBut at the same time they may just be trying to remove their guilt. Your sister being at college especially influences that, as you mentioned. In a way it's similar with your parents and sister, as with a couple where one person broke up with the other and that other person runs right back to an ex because he/she misses the attention. But when the sister reenters the scene the ex is completely forgotten about. \n\nAnyways, all I can recommend is what another redditor was recommended to do with his narcissistic family: keep things in your control and don't take any shit from them. For the meantime, agree to meet in a neutral location like a restaurant so you have the option to leave easily and you are less likely to be  ganged up on. If that goes well then you can try going to family events like reunions, birthdays, weddings etc. If they start to treat you bad again, either by being influenced by your sister's demanding of attention or them getting frustrated at you not forgiving them immediately, you bail. They don't deserve another shot after that",
            "Your parents solution to a perceived problem was horrific, but you already knew that.  You asked your Dad for an honest answer and he gave you everything he had to give.\n\nAll that's left is to decide:  1)  If you want to forgive your parents and 2) If you want to give them a second chance.  Those two things don't necessarily go hand in hand.  #2 can come before #1, as well.",
            "I think this post more or less convinced me that I should not try to reconcile with my parents... such an answer would devastate me more than the current situation of mutual avoidance: It would make me angry and wanting to take revenge or something, but at the same time I would not want to be that type of vengeful person. \n\nI don't know what you should do at this point, OP... but I would recommend to just let it rest, and not reply to them. There is really no point in feeling anything for your parents, not even hate. Because, if you hate them, as many others recommend... it will just turn you into a hateful person in general. Don't do that - there is simply no benefit in that.\n\nAlso, think about what's best for you - not for them. If you cannot pinpoint a specific advantage in reaching out to your parents, don't.\n",
            "Being deranged from family is not always a bad thing. Sometimes people are assholes even if you share the same blood. Additionally, when or if you become a parent, be the best one in the world. ",
            "Hi op. In your last thread I was the one pushing fort you too email, like this. I'm glad you went that route. It really told you all that though need to know. My next advice is to keep them cut off. Perhaps let them know those confession was welcomed but they are not absolved. You will be paying for their crimes in your own way. But their life sentence really should be no contact from you. You are too good for them.\n\nBest to you. ",

            "/u/GSnow once wrote something that I have read during hard times.\n\nHe said:\n\nAlright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.\n\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.\n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\n\nHope that helps. Im sorry for your loss.",

            "Oh honey. I am so sorry. I've been where you are. I lost my boyfriend of several years when I was 23. We were building a life together, getting ready to move in together. I was crushed. So I understand. \n\nFirst thing, people are asking you right now what they can do for you. Your parents have asked, or maybe a sibling. The answer is that they can run interference for you. Ask your mom to return calls to friends and family, let them know that you appreciate their calls, but that you're not ready to talk to anyone yet. Same with email, messages, whatever. Ask someone else to deal with them for you. \n\nSecond, ask people to either stay with you so you don't have to be alone, or leave you alone because you can't be with others right now. You know best what you need. It's ok to ask for it. After my boyfriend died, I drank Scotch with one of my not-that-close friends and watched shitty funny movies. I knew this friend would be Ok just sitting with me, letting me laugh or cry as I needed, and wouldn't make me feel more than I was ready to. Maybe try to find that person in your life and hang out with them. It may not be the person you immediately think of. \n\nThird, denial is an Ok thing. There's a reason we as a species developed it as a coping mechanism. If it helps you feel better to pretend for a little while that you're Ok, then pretend away, buddy. The sorrow will catch up with you eventually. You don't have to embrace it just yet if you're not ready. \n\nFourth, think about seeing a shrink. Sometimes it can help to have someone to talk to. \n\nFifth, I want you to know that you're going to be Ok. You'll never be the same. This is something that will haunt you forever and affect you in ways that you can't appreciate yet. But it will also make you a better person if you let it. Life is precious and impermanent. Loving your girlfriend was a wonderful part of your life, and it's your job now to take all of the incredible things you learned from her and go on to live an amazing rest of your life. You owe it to her to live and love enough for the both of you. You'll be Ok, in time. \n\nWhen my boyfriend died, I thought that was it for me. I didn't think I'd ever love anyone as much as I loved him. That was almost 10 years ago. 5 years ago I got married. I had a baby a year ago. My life is rich and full in ways I never imagined it could have been. Loving my boyfriend helped pave the way for loving my husband, and losing my boyfriend has made me so much more grateful for the life I have now. I'm grateful every day, because I know how easy it is for it to go away. I never take this happiness for granted, ever. And that's the gift my boyfriend's death gave me, the gift of appreciation. \n\nSo hang in there. It gets easier, I promise. The Hurt never goes away, but the pain becomes less relevant to your everyday life over time, and what you're left with is that immense feeling of love and gratitude. It takes time, but it comes. \n\nI hope your healing is as swift and gentle as it can be. Pm me if you want to talk. I'm happy to listen. ",

I was deeply depressed for a very long time. \n\nGrieve how you need to grieve. No one can tell you what you need to do. I still celebrate his birthday. He died almost eleven years ago now. It sucks.

Talking about it doesn't make you weak, and wanting to be alone doesn't either.  Maybe you can talk to your mother?  You don't even have to plan what you want to say or ask.  Just being with someone who knows what happened helps.  Don't shut yourself out.  Don't feel obliged to send something back when someone messages them.  A simple thank you is always nice for them but don't feel bad if you don't send anything back.  \n \nBut try not to get stuck in the routine of not replying.  As hard as it is to read, you have to move on.  You have to give this a place in your life.  The first few days, or even weeks, will be the hardest.  People will also ask you how you're doing.

Don't try to bury yourself in work, or games, or anything else in order to \"get away from the pain\".  You need the pain right now... you need to fully process it so you can begin the journey to your new normal.  In my talking with other widowed folks, one thing was clear... those who buried themselves in work or who purposefully avoided processing the grief at first were still messed up many years later.\n\n3. For the next few weeks, you're going to live in the \"now\", all the time.  You'll live to survive until the next moment, the next hour.  Then things will become a bit more stable and you'll live for the next day, and so on.\n\nThe first week or two after my DW's death, I literally had no thought process... the only things I knew were what my senses told me: is it light or dark outside?  Do I have to go to the bathroom?  My mother in law had to keep me fed because I totally forgot that eating was even a thing.  That's how messed up I was!  I took a month off work, doing nothing but existing.  It was the best thing I did.\n\nI know things are really raw for you now, but I hope you find peace soon.",
            "This question gets asked every once in a while, and [RisingTurtles](http://www.reddit.com/user/risingturtles) gave [a comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1t2bod/my_wife_recently_committed_suicide/ce3qrw0), explaining this in a beautiful way:\n\n> Putting this edit at the top: /u/Grindstone50k mentioned this in another thread: \"IF ANYONE READING ANY OF THIS IS HAVING ANY THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE, PLEASE CALL YOUR LOCAL SUICIDE HOTLINE RIGHT NOW!\"\n\n> There's a list of them from the /r/suicidewatch folks here:\n\n> http://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/17gu7g/hotline_numbers/\n\n> Man... fuck...\n\n> Listen: My wife died 9 years, 7 months, and 21 days ago, or so. Or so? fuck. 9 years, 7 months, 21 days, 9 hours, 52 minutes ago. So I'll cut the bullshit.\n\n> I could tell you it'll all be better in a while. I could tell you that someday, sometime in the future, you'll wake in the morning, make your tea and toast, and be 2/3 of the way through your drive to work before you even thought of her. I could tell you that, but that's a lie.\n\n> You love her, that much is clear from your post. Love, not loved. See, a breakup, that's different. A divorce, different. The relationship ends. Yours didn't. Yours won't. Ever. You'll love her forever, and for the rest of time she has a claim on your heart. You may find love again, and by God, if you do, go with it. But your girl will always own a part of your heart, a part of your soul, a part of you. This is how it works.\n\n> For now? Man, you're running shit on a day to day basis. You wake up on a Tuesday, you fucking survive Tuesday. Wednesday? Not your fucking problem. Tuesday. Survive Tuesday.\n\n> The kids? They need a therapist. If I can be sexist for a moment, my friend, they need a female therapist. Older. They need someone, though, and no matter how much you clearly love them, you can't get them through this alone. You're dad, not mum. Such is life. So get them a Goddamn doctor.\n\n> After that? Shit, after the kids are stabilized, that's when the real difficulties begin. See, you have two paths. You can try to heal, work through it, understand that it isn't your fault, all that bullshit, and eventually find love. Or you can, for lack of any better term, \"turn inward.\" You turn inward, and that's the ballgame. I fucking know this, man. I turned inward. I loved my wife. I've never loved another woman. I've dated, I've made friends, I've had sex, all that bullshit, but at some point, I always turn back inwards and see my wife's face, smiling over a plate of potatoes and eggs, as she laughs at one of my stupid jokes. (\"This potato's watching me. It's a spec-tater!\")\n\n> Simple fact: your life just changed. It can't, and won't, change back. You need to get those kids into therapy, and you need to join a Goddamn group of men who have suffered this loss. PM me if you need an ear, and I'll give you my number. I can't say it won't get easier, because it hasn't for me. But if you make the effort and try to recover, it might, I don't really know, I never really felt like trying. But I can tell you from my end of things, from the POV of the guy who never tried and looked only inwards, dying a bit each day, it doesn't get a fuck bit better my way. So keep trying, keep surviving, if not for you than for the kids.\n\n> And seriously, PM me. I'll give you my number, if we're in driving distance, I'll drive out and buy you about thirty rounds. Just do better than I've done, because by God, the way I've done it is terrible and only prolongs the misery.",
            "Just telling you right now\u2014record that fucking voice mail message with some line-in recording software before the phone is disconnected. If you have no other recordings of her or her voice, it'll be like losing her again if you don't.",
            "I am so sorry for your loss.\n\nWhat you can do is this --- just get through the next hour. That's all you have to do. You can be still, you can cry, you can sob deeply, you can sleep, you can listen to music, watch TV or simply sit and be numb. Just an hour. That's all.\n\n\nIf you get through the next hour, take on another hour. That's all you have to do. One day - as you go through the grieving process - you will find you have gotten through an entire day without the physical and mental anguish you are experiencing at the moment. Then you will begin to heal fully. \n\nIt will happen I assure you.\n\n\nRemember, for now, simply get through the next hour.\n\n\nI will keep you in my mind and heart, in a quiet and hopeful place there.\n\n\n*Nana internet hug*",
            "   It seems you are at the same spot I was almost a year ago. My boyfriend died suddenly as well. Instead of just spitting generic answers to you, let me tell you what I experienced (because I really wish someone had when this happened to me) and maybe it'll shed light on what you will most likely go through so you know that there is life after death (this is something that took me a while to understand).      \n\nYou are going to hate everyone and anything. Not in a malicious nasty troll way but people are going to come up to you and ask you if you're okay, and that they are so sorry. You'll want to punch them in the face because you've heard it 1,000 times already and you'll feel like people are doing it just to get into your business...not because they are genuinely concerned. Now that being said I can't speak for everyone...but most people are really concerned and really do want to help take that pain away. You'll realize it one day like I did and will appreciate it. \n\nPeople will like to remind you that you are young and that it's a sin you have to deal with this at such a young age. This will in return, will probably make you feel less than awesome. Choose not to let that effect you in that way when you are strong enough to do so. I realized that yeah this did happen to me at a young age and I'm not going to let it set the pace for the rest of my life (in a negative way) because my loved one wouldn't have wanted that and I know I don't want that. I have my whole life ahead of me, as do you.     \n\nYou're going to feel a flood of emotions and not know what to do with yourself. My greatest advice to you, is do whatever you feel necessary to get through this as long as it is a healthy and positive outlet. Go stay at your friends house if you are feeling trapped in your room. Cry. Go for long walks. Go hang out with her family and talk. Eat...and eat a lot. **Seek out counseling and just talk everything out for 45 minutes straight**. Submerge yourself into your studies. Do things the two of you liked to do by yourself or with a close friend. Watch a ton of stand up on youtube. Find a series on Netflix and watch it from start to finish (for me it was Breaking Bad).    \n\nThere's a million and one other things I would love to tell you, but unfortunately it will go in one ear and out the other right now because I know you're hurting and you're just trying to make sense of what happened. So when you're ready, you are more than welcome to PM and rant all you want to me or I'll try and tell you what I did to help my situation in hopes that it could help you. The truth is everyone deals with horrible things like this differently and there really is no better healer than time unfortunately. As for the people messaging you thank them, but if you don't want to talk to them you have zero obligation to do so (I wish I had known that last year). Do what YOU need to do. Not what anyone else needs to do to cope with something like this. The only person you have an obligation to is yourself.    \n\nAll of that being said, I'm really sorry to hear about your girlfriend. Please feel free to PM me anytime and I will get back to you as soon as I can if you need anything. ",
            "Holy shit y'all are making me cry at work. This is awful. I need to go tell my boyfriend that I love him. I need to somehow car-crash-proof him. Omg OP I am so, so so sorry. To everyone banding togther in this thread, you are so strong. ",

If something makes you happy for a brief moment, it's ok to be upset at being happy again.\n\nDeath creates a wound in us. Like any wound, it will take time to heal. The amount of time is different for everyone. It will leave a scar. The scar will make you different. Not better or worse, but just different.\n\nLet yourself feel what your mind needs to feel. Don't try to think, just try to be.\n\nYou may not believe it now, but things will get better.",

No matter how much you miss her, or loved her, she's gone. And it sucks, it really fucking sucks, and it's shitty, because there will be moments where you'll forget that she's gone and you'll think she's just around the corner and you'll remember and it'll be like she died all over again. You'll remember today for the rest of your life, you lost someone so close to you, almost in the blink of an eye. There's nothing you can do about it either, this isn't a fairy tail happy ending, it's not a prank, and you can't save her, or take her place.\n\nThere's only one thing you can do, you move forward.

I just kept on going through life on autopilot until the fog lifted.  I am not sure this is comforting or not, but when your in that fog, that a lot of us have felt, remember you're not alone.  Many people are there; and it is my opinion that we can't communicate in the density of the fog, or see others, but we know that the pain has been shared before.  Spend some time alone, spend sometime with others, don't feel like you have to communicate or explain your feelings.  Some of my best healing was just being with someone and not talking.  Don't feel guilty about anything you do, eating, or laughing at a unexpected joke.  Thinking of you man.",

I did everything that I could to break myself and the world because fuck it. I lost the first person to ever say \"I love you\" to me, so why should I even bother?\n\nHearing the cut and dry response of \"I'm sorry\" was the most infuriating thing. But they just kept on saying it. You either become numb to it and robotically respond with \"thank you\", or lash out like a wounded creature. \n\nThat pain you feel in your chest won't magically disappear after some set period of time no matter what they say. It's like the dull ache of a stab wound. Sharp at first, then it slowly subsides and scabs over. If you keep on picking at that scab, it will bleed and leave a nasty scar. God knows that my scar is gnarled and thick. You'll have to learn how to stop picking at it, how to let the itching subside.\n\nYou might need a psychologist or someone who has been through this to teach you how to stop yourself from tearing open that hole. Whiskey is a poor substitute.\n\nDoes the pain go away entirely? No. On rainy days the pain comes back, fresh as ever. The same as any scar I guess. For most days however, you will barely notice it. I'm 25 going on 26, and I finally have come to some semblance of terms as to what happened. It has taught me in the most brutal of fashions that everything is ephemeral. I cherish my memories of her, and have learned to cherish the new memories that I have made as well.

Go through the stages, but don't allow yourself to stagnate. You need to keep moving forward, as hard as it is. I'm sure she wouldn't want you to give up on everything.

I hate saying that it will get better because that's not what you want to hear in the moment of grief. \n\nBut, after a while you will love again. And you will love stronger. You'll hold them tighter and kiss them longer. You'll tell them every chance you get that you're so in love with them because you both need to know that you'll love again.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss and I love you for what you're going through.

I panicked, there was now a huge financial hole for my everyday life and now school. Every time I talked about it with anyone I couldn't even hold back the tears. But as time goes on, it isn't that you get over it, you learn to deal with it. It improves everyday. There are days where it might be worse but time heals.

I'm grateful now because his phone numbers got recycled but I'll always have a piece of his voice. I'm finally at a point where listening it to makes me smile instead of cry. \n\nI would also recommend going to college and making sure you make an appointment with counseling and psychological services. On most campuses these services are free for students and it will really help in the long run if you let them know what you are going through. Also, remember this is not your defining characteristic. \n\nA timeline ( I remember after awhile wondering when I would feel normal again) that people say is common:For the first three days I was completely numb and could do nothing but sit and stare. For a week I was pretty shocked. At about 2.5 months it finally stopped being the only thing I could think about and I could finally think about my dad without crying. A year and a half later I am okay. There are certain things that hurt me (his birthday, Holidays I primarily spent with him) and certain things that destroy me all over again (Robin Williams death sent me in a huge consuming thought for almost a week about how everyone I knew was going to die and it terrified me thinking about other family members and my boyfriend dying and how much each of those will destroy me all over again)\n\nFinally, you don't have to respond to those messages or cards. People will understand. After 2 weeks I finally starting responding to some people. ",
            "So sorry you are going through this. I have been in a similar situation-- a drunk driver killed my boyfriend of 2 years, on Memorial Day in 2011. He was 23 years old and had just graduated from college, become a US citizen, and gotten a $50,000 grant for an urban agriculture project in our city. It was devastating. Just briefly since I am at work, here are a few things I remember: \n\n-- I got a lot of support from his family, whom I had met just twice before he was killed. I spent almost every day with them until I moved across the country 3 months later. If you feel comfortable around your girlfriend's family, go for it. They were early risers, so I used to have breakfast with them randomly on a lot of days before work.\n\n-- Moving across the country was essential to my recovery. Every street corner and little object in my apartment reminded me of him and caused me to burst out crying uncontrollably. As much as I hated the thought of it, putting some distance between myself and those memories helped me move on. It took me almost exactly a year to stop randomly busting out crying, although I still get pretty emotional whenever I am back in that city, seeing our old friends and his family.\n\n-- I wrote down every single possible thing I could remember about him. Every single thing. I couldn't bare the thought of forgetting any of it. I really love the thought of just having those notebooks full of memories. I shared a lot of the stories with his parents. To them, I was the last little window into their son's life. I even made a website for friends to share stories with his parents (it is currently a little messy): http://rememberliam.com/\n\n-- Accept help from friends when you need it. About two months after my boyfriend was killed, my life had become a super busy whirlwind of social activities and working on continuing my boyfriend's research project until we could find someone to officially take it over. I couldn't stand to be alone, so I'd make sure every spare second after work was filled with activities, but I was falling behind on housecleaning. One of the most caring things that one of my boyfriend's friends did for me was insist that she come over and clean my apartment. I was almost too embarrassed to let her in, but I eventually said fuck it, and let her help me out. It was wonderful. I just sat on the floor and cried the whole time while she cleaned. Hah. \n\n-- I remember being very scared about forgetting him, especially when people would tell me things would get better as time went on. It's been a little over 3 years now and I am happy. I haven't forgotten him (still wear a little bracelet on my left wrist that I'd made for him for Valentine's Day). So no worries about forgetting her. \n\n-- I also remember being mad for his loss of such a joyous life that he lived so thoroughly. And I was so mad for my own loss-- having finally found someone whom I loved so much. Just saying that to acknowledge it-- that's a thing I felt, too. It still makes me tear up just writing it.  \n\n-- I remember telling folks after my boyfriend was killed that I felt like I was just 50% myself. I still felt so connected to him. As soon as he died, I felt like I'd become 50% him as well. That probably sounds insane. Anyway, the point is that especially in the first year after he was killed, I became motivated to try things that I thought he may have been interested in. I was living in a new city (started grad school) and I met a lot of new people, learned a lot, and got great comfort from feeling connected to him through these new activities (ex: working on my college's farm, doing some research in a biofuel lab, visiting a hackerspace in my city, doing street art). I also feel like these activities were a gift from him-- a great distraction from the otherwise constant grief, which helped me heal especially in the first year. \n\nJeez, what else to say? So sorry. Take it easy, stay busy and surrounded by friends, and when you get to college, use the time to be focused on working hard and doing well. I was always a hard worker, but I work extra hard now to make my life count not only for myself, but for my boyfriend who will never get the opportunity to do the things I can still do. \n\nAnd it does get better. :)",

That said, no one can no what you're going through, not even those who have had similar situations because your loss is unique and your girlfriend was unique and your relationship was unique. But if I can offer any advice it is this:\n1. Know that it is going to hurt, deeply and strangely and in varying waves for a long time (years, though not always this much, I promise). \n2. If you need to isolate yourself, that's allowed. In fact anything that keeps you going is allowed. There's no \"right way\" to handle grief, so no matter what anyone says, allow the grief to affect you in whatever strange ways it does. \n3. When you're feeling the tiniest bit stronger, accept the help people are offering to you. It's isolating enough as it is and while no one can understand what you're going through, sometimes just sitting with someone else while you cry or rage or laugh about good times can do a world of good. You will need a support system, so accept it when you're ready. \n\nMsg if there's anything you want to talk about.",

            "Take it one day at a time. One hour at a time if you have to. There's nothing wrong with crying. When my dad suddenly died(went to work, suddenly collapsed by himself in a hallway and just never came home) I went sat in his room, hugged his shoes and just sobbed. I collected his cigarette butts from that morning in a small container and put them up(grief can do weird things and there's nothing wrong with that). When we got his clothes back from OSHA I held them and sobbed some more. If you need to cry, even privately, let yourself do so.\n\nLike someone else said, everyone handles grief differently. My dad was a pretty funny guy, so my sister and I sat around telling funny stories we remembered. Laughing and crying is pretty releasing.\n\nIf you don't want to talk to anyone, that's okay. It might help to just ask everyone to please let you be for a while and to spread that around so you can be at peace. Death is awful, but unfortunately the world doesn't stop when ours does, and eventually you're going to have to put aside the grief to deal with the reality of the situation, and it's going to be hard, but you can do it.\n\nI am very, very sorry for your loss.",

            "My husband's late fiance died about 8 months before we met. He was heartbroken. From what I know, he didn't go to work for two weeks and decided to quit his job after that. He was in a deep depression pretty much until we met.\n\nI know he was afraid he'd never be happy again, never love again. He wanted his heart to heal and find love, but he was scared that it was impossible, that he'd already had his time. We got together, and he was still afraid, because we fell in love so very quickly, he feared that he was latching onto the first hope--too quickly letting his heart get wrapped up in something that maybe wasn't real. \n\nLuckily, he realized that his feelings (and mine) were real, and strong. \n\nMy advice for those who want to love someone who's lost a partner (from my own experience): \n\nDon't allow jealousy to enter your mind. It can be difficult. You want to fill the void that they left, but you can't. You can only make your own place in their heart. They still love that person, and should always have that right. You are not being compared in the way you think. It's not a competition. It's an appreciation of similarities and differences. \n\nIf they want to talk about that lost partner, listen and be there for them. The grieving process is important, and the fact that they're sharing this with you, believe it or not, is a means of connecting with you. They're sharing the love and pain they've felt. They're letting you lift the emotional weight off their shoulders by sharing.\n\nBe gentle with the heart you hold; it's been broken before, and is likely not done mending. You can help it mend with time and patience, but it still scars. ",
            "Please know this, We are with you. I'm pretty sure most of us in this thread have lost someone they loved. You are not alone, regardless of how you are feeling now. You will get through this and if you ever need to talk about her or anything,\nWe will all be here because other people were there for us. I have never met you and probably never will i just want you to know I love you. ",
            "they will delete the vmail when the phone plan is canceled if its something that you want to keep/have forever, save it now.  good luck.",
            "Im so sorry for your loss, i know this is late but im new to this subreddit. I just wanna know how you are doing after five months have passed.",
            "Welp. That's too bad. Sorry that this happened to you, that's about the worst thing I can imagine.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some positives: you still have your parents and your own future. Her loss will always haunt you, *but do not let it define you*.",
            "Your reaction is completely normal.\n\nWe are sorry for your loss. The driver must be feeling really horrible too - they're probably not really a cunt at all.\n\n\nTake as long as you need (3 months maximum though) to grieve and mourn. After that, you need to move on. No one wants to see you ruin your life and screw over yourself (dare I say, her). You may have to box everything (EVERYTHINGGGG) up if you can't bare the sight of her photos and stuff she gave you.\n\n\nPpl telling you that they're sorry for your loss.. tell them thanks. Ppl asking you if you're ok, tell them you're still in shock. Idk, do what you're comfortable with.\n\n\nYou will be fine, OP.",
            "I'm so sorry for your loss. I can only imagine what you must be going through, and I wish I could offer more than my condolences.\n\nTake care. (hug)",
            "Just give it time. It's the only thing you can do in these situations... And remember her for all the good things you lived together :)",
            "I am so sorry for your loss. I don't have any advice because I can not possibly imagine the feelings that you are going through now. Best of luck my friend.",
            "Shit man, I can't even imagine how you must be feeling. ",
            "Man, I can't even begin to imagine how tough things must be for you. I am so sorry. Please stay strong for your loved ones around you. I am so incredibly sorry that this had to happen. ",
            "I am so sorry to hear this. My deepest condolences.\n\nYou have (or will have) survivor's guilt. This may lead you down a self destructive path of high risk behavior, drugs, alcohol ... you name it.\n\nSo, Don't.  Greave instead.  \n\nYou need to think about her popping into your life at any moment and asking \"what are you doing and what have you done with your life\"?\n\nIf it's not what you would have done with her in your life, you're disrespecting her memory and that's a betrayal of your love for her.\n\nI hope this makes sense to you.\n\nYou'll never meet another woman like her in your life. But you will meet someone at some time, when you are ready. And you'll be loved. You'll be able to give love.",
            "First of all, Im sorry for your loss. Life can be cruelly unfair at times and this is certainly one of those times.\n\nThis is a shocking loss and you dont know what to do. Fortunately, you are not the first to go through this type of devastating loss. There is a social etiquette that you can rely on to get through these first very difficult days. \n\n* You thank your friends for their concern. (\"Thanks bro. It means a lot to have your support on this one\" is all you need to say). \n* You ask one carefully selected person to come with you to the funer all as your emotional support. (It is better for her family if  if this person is not a young female person unrelated to you.) \n* You show up at the funeral. Send your own flowers with a simply worded card. (The flowers can be simple...a single red rose is sufficient. The card just needs to say \"Love ypu. Miss you. Ttyl. Jack\")\n* You send her parents a note of condolence. \n* You weep when overcome by understandable emotions. If the weeping stage persists ask your parents to help you find a grief counselor.\n\nBest if luck OP. This really sucks.",
            "From a well-meaning stranger, I am sorry for your loss, and though this is clich\u00e9, this much is true: time will make it better. \n\n:) ",
            "I was hit by a car at age 15 and struck the windshield with my head. The driver was an idiot old man who should have lost his license, but didn't because he knew the cops. I never got justice or any sort of apology for the ordeal. I had no long-term injuries but could have easily died. My advice to you is make the cunt pay. Harass him, threaten him, even make some phone calls to his loved ones. Your life lost a lot of value...... Sieze it back. Make him pay. Give a good scare to some of the people he loves. That's the least you can do for your girlfriend. You may find you don't want to live anymore. Do something useful before it sucks all the life out of you.",
