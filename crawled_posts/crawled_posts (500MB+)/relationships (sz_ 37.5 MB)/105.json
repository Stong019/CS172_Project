My girlfriend [22/F] is my best friend of 16 years and we've been dating for two months. \n\nShe asked to borrow his laptop to do homework, when the three of us were hanging out at his home. While carrying it she slipped on a water spill, she didn't get hurt, but the laptop was damaged badly, albeit still repairable. \n\nMy friend started losing his shit at my girlfriend, even though she apologized and offered to pay for the cost of the repair. I pulled him aside and asked why the hell he was freaking out. He said I needed to break up with my girlfriend because of how careless she was, or else we couldn't be friends anymore. Then he went on a weird rant about how I shouldn't have started dating her in the first place because I deserve better, but I think he was projecting hard about something.\n\nIt boggles my mind that he wants me to break up with her because she accidentally damaged his laptop, over his negligence in not cleaning up the spilled water. I'm not breaking up with my girlfriend, so I assume my friendship with him is over. \n\nThe thing is, he's a member of our team [5 people including myself] for the video game [League of Legends] that we play. He's irreplaceable, there's no one that we know of who is equal in skill level to him, that also plays his role. We take the game very seriously by meeting up and practicing every weekend, going over our replays to see how we can get better, improve our communication, etc. \n\nI don't want to play with him anymore, or have him on the team because of the way he handled everything. I'm not sure how, or if I should bring up what happened to my other teammates.\n\n---\n\n**There has been a recent development in the situation and an update will come soon.**\n\n---\n\n**tl;dr:** My girlfriend asked to borrow my friend's laptop and she slipped on a water spill while carrying it. The laptop was damaged badly but is repairable. My friend lost his shit at my girlfriend even though she apologized and offered to pay for the cost of the repair. \n\nHe told me I needed to break up with her because of how careless she was, but then he went on some weird rant about how she didn't deserve to date me. He's a member of our team for the video game that we play together, and he's irreplaceable. I don't want to play with him, or have him be apart of the team anymore, but I don't know how or if I should bring that up with everyone.\n",

            "> Then he went on a weird rant about how I shouldn't have dated her in the first place because I deserve better\n\nIt's pretty obvious he's been stewing in resentment over her for a while now and this incident, in his mind, justified his feelings and gave him an excuse to express them ",
            "You should talk to the other three people in the gaming group before he does. You want to take control of the narrative and establish that he's behaving badly - you especially want to emphasize that your girlfriend takes full responsibility for her mistake and will pay to have the laptop repaired. Get the other folks on board with the idea that his demands are nutty and of replacing Jerkface if he won't back down. \n\nThen, give Jerkface a few days to calm down and get back in touch with him. Explain that his demand is unreasonable...you love your girlfriend and of course you're not dumping her. Let him know that the offer to pay for repairs still stands and you're open to continue gaming with him if he apologizes for his way out of line demands to break up with your girlfriend. I suspect he will back down when (if) he sees that the other players on the team are backing you up. ",

The perfect team mate I had before turned into an asshole that our team couldn't trust to cooperate with strats and became argumentative for no other reason than to just defy me or my ideas/opinions. It was disruptive to the team, caused a lot more fights and we ended up having to replace him because of his attitude anyway. \n\nThe guy in my situation had a problem where he couldn't separate what happened socially outside the game to what we'd all been working towards and practicing for inside the game. \n\nMy point here is that if being friends outside the game is a requirement for the team, then your team is already broken. Mourn it, move on and replace him. \n\n",

You should come across as being as rational and truthful as possible, which you do by being calm, not embellishing the story, and not needlessly insulting this person (like in your text here). Really make clear that your girlfriend immediatly apologiesed and offered fair compensation. Doing this over text is okay, via phone is better, and in person is best.\n\nIf you are close friends to anyone in the gaming group, then confide in them more about how you are feeling about the situation and ask their advice on how to handle your mutual friend.\n\nEven as you said you would wait to hear from them, if you don\u2019t hear anything within 24 hours you reach out to them.

Tell them that Freak Out Boy has pushed the issue, that he has demanded that you choose between him and your gf and that you are choosing your gf. Tell them sorry for the inconvenience of finding a new player, but this mess is not of your making, and you are choosing the only reasonable option. \n\nIf Freak Out Boy backs down and says he still wants you to play on the team, you're going to have to know ahead of time what your response will be. Can you play with team but not see him otherwise?  Or maybe you've decided to quit the team no matter what...you're just going to have to decide exactly what outcome you want and then tell them.

I think it should go without saying here that your girlfriend handled this situation really well and your friends actions are unacceptable! He is totally trying to be controlling here and didn't express himself in a manner that helped the situation. Rather than accepting your girlfriend's nice offer he loses his shit on your girlfriend and demands you to break up with her or nix your own friendship.\n\nNow I get the feeling a bit of your friends freak out might come from the fact that his laptop potentially broke in front of him which can be a bit of a traumatic experience for gamer oriented people. I do not however think that is the only thing going on here and feel that if you really want to continue your friendship with this guy you've got to let him know his actions were uncalled for and have him apologize not only to you but your girlfriend as well. He should give you an explanation before you even consider really continuing this friendship. he should also give a fully thought out apology before paying for the computer repairs.\n\nAs for you LOL team, as others have stated better than I, explain what happened to them. If for some reason things actualyl do take a turn for the worst but you still want to play league please feel free to message me. I have a solid group of almost 7-9 people that I play with who vary from bronze players to plat players and most of us (6-7) have been trying to improve our skills as well. If you ever want to shoot the shit even if things do workout feel free to contact us. my team loves trying to set up 5v5 in customs for skims but we usually lack the numbers. it would be an awesome experience to have another 5 stack to help us improve while we help you.

If things go well, great. If not, it might be best to discuss the problem with your teammates because the resentment would affect how your team performs in games--- I can imagine a possibility of toxic arguments in times where you or him make mistakes (which is inevitable).

You can get to know people in other teams and ask if they are interested in joining you.\n\nFor most professional teams, roster changes are unavoidable, and this behaviour towards a friend and a teammate is obviously unfriendly and unprofessional and kick-worthy.

The rest of the group might wonder, even if you don't like this guy anymore, can't you just tolerate his presence in the game, and interact with him for game purposes, while still maintaining your boundary about not being his friend anymore? You are making them choose between you two, while you are mad at your friend for demanding you make a similar choice.

        "selftext": "My younger brother, let's call him John \\[18\\], was subjected to random drug testing at his high school last week. (He knew he was eligible for it, students must sign a consent form at the start of the school year). He is a frequent smoker, and tested positive for weed. He tried to get ahead of the situation by telling my parents what had happened. My parents freaked out, acted like John is a complete failure, and started to think of ways to punish him. My parents and my brother already didn't have a great relationship, and this event made it much worse. Thankfully nothing criminal will come of this, John just has to take an online drug counseling course. He is going off to college this fall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI \\[23F\\] am in graduate school in another state. I never smoked in high school, and now in college it's a very infrequent activity, mostly when I'm home by myself to de-stress or at small social gatherings. Weed has never negatively impacted my life, I've gotten good grades, internships, fully-funded grad school, never in trouble with the law. I've always had a great relationship with my parents and feel close to them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, my brother and I haven't always had the greatest relationship. My parents tend to view me as the \"golden child\" and compare my brother and I. I've tried to be close with my brother but I think he feels some anger towards me because of my parents. However, one thing John and I recently bonded over was weed. I suspected he smoked and told him I have too. Our relationship improved a bit, I think it helped him see me as more relatable and more of a friend. We talked about it a few times but never smoked together or anything like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, back to my parents finding out about John and freaking out. My parents decided they were going to drug test him from now on, and he could lose his phone, car, and even college if he keeps smoking. Well, John ended up ratting me out to my parents (who had NO idea I'd ever smoked). I think he threw me under the bus to try and make his actions look better. Now, my parents are saying that to be fair, they're going to drug test both of us, and if I test positive they will take my car. My parents seemed like they don't really want to drug test me - in fact, my mom said she would try and tell me in advance of when they would do it - but they want to be \"fair\". Keep in mind, I am still living out of state this summer, so any drug testing would take place when I visit home (which is only going to happen a few times).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wasn't planning on smoking the next few months because my internship random drug tests. However, I feel like my parents aren't respecting my decisions and privacy as an adult. It isn't like I still live at home, and weed isn't impacting my life in any way. It was solely my brother's fault that he got caught. Additionally, my boyfriend lives in a state where weed is legal, so really, what do they expect? The only thing that still ties me to my parents is that they own the car I drive. They agreed to let me drive this when I started grad school, as they knew I wouldn't make much money and they valued me furthering my education. However, I pay for everything else myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you think my parents are being reasonable? Is it fair to apply John's punishment to me, even though we are at very different stages in our lives? How can I tell my parents I am uncomfortable with this while maintaining a good relationship? And how do I address this breach of trust with my brother? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: My younger brother got caught smoking weed, and my parents plan to randomly drug test him. He snitched to them that I've smoked too, and now they want to drug test me.\n\nEdited to add: My brother came to me right after he was tested asking for help and advice. right after this situation went down, I was very clear with my parents that I have smoked and I thought they were overreacting. I defended my brothers actions and tried to educate them about marijuana. Many people are attacking me for the way my brother has been treated but I have very much supported and defended him.",

Bike, walk, carpool, public transport, or find a craigslist beater for cheap.  I'm a hard headed a-hole so me personally, I'd give the car back and tell them to shove it just on the principle of not letting them have something to hold over my head once they've shown that it's something they're willing to do because they suck at parenting their other child.  Just because your parents help you out doesn't mean you should submit to any stupid degrading treatment they bark out.  Being a good parent to an adult child doesn't entitle them to intrude in your life and make demands, so if that's the attitude they are going to take, I'd personally make sure they have zero financial/legal stake in your life from now on, and adamantly refuse any help and/or large gifts from this point on, with this as the verbally stated reason.\n\nAlso be sure to let them know how stupid they're being by trying to treat you like a minor child when you live out of state and are 23.\n\nAs for your brother.  I'd tell him if he's old enough to smoke dope, he's old enough to handle his own problems without throwing you under the bus.

Are you absolutely certain you want to destroy our relationship over this?\"",
            "Unfortunately I think you want something that's impossible. \n\nI don't think you have any way of staying neutral in this dispute between your parents and your brother. You either side with your parents and say smoking isn't OK (which will hurt your relationship with your brother), or you side with your brother and say your parents are wrong to freak out (which will hurt your relationship with your parents). If you just say nothing, then by default you'll be siding with your parents.\n\nI'm not sure it's fair to say that your brother breached your trust (unless you made a big deal of \"never tell our parents this\" - in which case yeah, he did). I think you're right to say he was trying to make his actions look better - but it sounds as though you don't even think there was anything really wrong with his actions. Smoking at a time when he was near guaranteed to get caught wasn't smart - and I think you could reinforce that by talking to him about why you don't smoke during your internship - but it sounds like your parents are making a much bigger fuss than you think is reasonable. So if you do choose to side with your parents, your brother is likely to think you're a hypocrite.\n\nCan you afford to pay for transportation without your parents' help? If you can, then I think the most supportive thing you could do for your brother is offer to give the car back. Explain to your parents that you didn't realise the car came with the condition that you didn't smoke, and that you wouldn't have accepted it if you had realised.\n\nIf you can't afford to pay for transportation without your parents' help, then your choices are trickier. You either refuse the drug testing and essentially dare them to take the action they've threatened, or you accept the drug testing (and accept that their money gives them some control over you). Neither of those are good options.",

But if you take money from them, don't be surprised that the money comes with strings. If you accept their financial support, you accept their conditions, and one of those conditions is no drug use. \n\nI supported myself through grad school.

Then ask  - Do you have any concerns about the progress I'm making? No? Then what are you hoping that taking a drug test will show you? If John was failing school/athletics/not setting goals/withdrawn or depressed then I understand his drug use could contribute to that and John needs to find a different coping mechanism and a consequence of taking away his phone/car might help motivate him.

When you go home just pour fake pee into the testing cup. You can get them cheap at pretty much any head shop. That will insure your parents sanity and that you get to keep your car. \nMany might argue that this means you aren\u2019t standing up for yourself but you have to ask yourself if this a battle that is really worth fighting. There is no reason you should stress over something that is so silly and petty. Keep your parents in the dark and focus on school and your internships.

There is no greater lesson to be learned here because you've always had your shit together. Furthermore, this will only teach to your brother that he doesnt have to take full responsibility for his actions and that it's okay to throw someone under the bus in order to look better himself. Finally, it's plain wrong that your parents are educating you two as if you were both living at home and have the same age. He's barely legally adult and still under their roof, it's perfectly normal that your parents are more strict with him than they are with you. \n\nHonestly,  it looks like a lazy way for them to solve the situation without having to explain to your brother that he's not entilted to the same freedom that you are and to manage his feelings.",

            "Your parents are in the wrong here. Sure, they may not find it very positive to know that both you and your little brother smoke, but since both and your brother are adults they legally have zero say in the matter, especially if smoking is done in a state where it is legal. Smoking in your free time is your decision and same goes for your brother. Your parents may force a rule that no smoking is to be done at their property but that is about it. \n\nYour parents are completely in the wrong for using the car as a scare tactic and control measure to force you towards their believes. If I were you, I'd save up for a car of your own and return their car as fast as you can because this will not be the first time that they will threaten you.",

I would just flat out tell them that if they do this shit I'd stop coming home to visit. Full stop. You're what, 23? Really ask them if they want to be pushing you guys away rn during a time where both of you are becoming independent and leaving the house.

It\u2019s not really invading your privacy if you choose yourself to allow it to make things easier for yourself.\n\nTake a stand = lose car\nDo drug test you know you\u2019ll pass = nothing changes. \n\nSeems like a no brainier myself, sometimes being an adult is putting aside all the \u201cmy privacy\u201d bullshit your scream as a teenager, and just taking the easiest route because life is hard enough.\n\nJust my opinion.",
            "I\u2019d say tell your parents that you\u2019ve smoked before and that you aren\u2019t going to take their drug test. Your brother is subject to their rules as he lives at home and is in high school but you aren\u2019t as you\u2019re an adult. However, if they decide to take your car I think they are within their rights but it would be really dumb. Also, maybe use this as an opening to talk about drug safety and why he shouldn\u2019t do it at 18 (brain development plus it links to increased anxiety in teens) and explain how when he is independent he can decide for himself.\n\nPersonally, as a freshman in college who has recently started smoking weed (both socially and on my own time) the stuff is legitimately why I\u2019m still in college right now. My depression is practically gone, I don\u2019t have trouble falling asleep anymore, and I really like college. I used to cry driving back but now I\u2019m home for the summer and can\u2019t wait to go back in the fall. Obviously this won\u2019t be the case for everyone but as long as you use it in moderation you\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s (chemically) non-addictive plus it\u2019s not even half as harmful as alcohol (rolling papers in your lungs is about as bad as it gets). I\u2019m not saying everyone should go get high but I\u2019m saying that if he\u2019s gonna smoke (which he probably will later in life) make sure he\u2019s being safe and smart about it.

They had done a great job raising you and you are grateful for your car and tuition (if they are paying for that too). I would tell them straight up you are not a child what you do in your free time is none of their business especially if it is legal where you are.

            "I\u2019ve been in an extremely similar situation. It\u2019s sucks that your parent are so close-minded about weed, mine sure were for a long time (They have since researched and come around to not caring who partakes).  \nHonestly what it came down to was I had to buy my own car. They would not budge on being responsible for someone else driving a car they owned that could not pass a drug test. I ended up buying the car I was driving from them and they were still pretty unhappy that I smoked but I was not willing to give that up for them; after all I was already an adult and that is not their decision to make. \nI\u2019d refuse the drug test; you\u2019re over 21 and you don\u2019t even live with them. You do not need to do whatever they want. I\u2019d just go ahead and return their car (or ask them if they\u2019d like to sell the one you are driving to you) and that\u2019s that. \nIt sucks but as long as they\u2019re supporting you in any way they\u2019re probably going to make a huge deal out of it. \nGood luck!",

            "So when I got caught I thought the world end, because my parents freaked out. They were pretty mad in the beginning, but after a week or two everything was fine again... Now Im actually casually joking about it with them. The other day I accidentally left a small metal box in my jacket where I store j's in. My Mom found it, smiled and said that I at least had the right gear....\n\nSo I guess even if you get tested you're gonna be fine. Eventually even parents realize that weed isnt that bad.",

My brother was always the \"problem\" child though and was always getting in trouble for things I did and just didn't get caught doing. \n\nThe tides changed a bit when we were in high school. I skipped a lot of days but still managed to keep a high GPA. So when my brother got caught skipping his first time he immediately threw me under the bus. My parents called and got my attendance reports, realized what was going on... I didn't even have an opportunity to deny it. \n\nMy parents then changed the rule to an long as you have all A's then you can skip school as long as they knew where we were. They knew it was more important to keep communication open between their teenagers than punish us for something that we were likely going to do anyway and start keeping secrets in a time when kids need to be learning independence. They didn't want to be the parents who had no clue what their kids were doing and when. \n\nIMO you need to open up with your parents, essentially making the argument you made here, and that your brother tried and failed to make by using you as an example. Coming from you, the GC, might make them see how their rules aren't going to accomplish what they want. Call their bluff and tell them if they really feel like taking the car back they can, but point out that they should be striving to have healthy, happy, honest, and open adult children. That if they want to make other rules regarding weed, such as not bringing it in their house, that that is reasonable but what they're asking and expecting of the two of you is not.

And mean it.\n\nMy parents held money over me as long as they could, and calling them on it was the only way to get out. Throughout all of high school, it was \"if you don't listen to us we won't pay for your college\". Then in college it was \"we'll stop paying for your college\".  I called their bluff a few times and did a lot of planning into how I could pay for things myself (even considered joining the military, ugh), but they always backpedaled and we'd reach a sort of intermediate compromise on whatever it was we were arguing about.\n\nThey'll continue to do this to you and your brother as long as they hold anything over you, and it's not okay. It's not healthy. And it doesn't stop. At age 30 I was visiting my sister after she gave birth and got into an argument with my parents about something dumb, and it turned into them threatening what they could (which wasn't much) but I called them on it and booked a flight home within hours. Now they walk on eggshells around me because they realize that getting to see me is a privilege and if they treat me like shit I will leave.

I defended my brothers actions and tried to educate them about marijuana. \n\nSo what's the point of testing you if they know you smoke? They've being weird. You could stop smoking long enough to pass their test but that's kind of shitty to your brother. You smoke, he smokes, and you have time to get away with it. So did he, I guess, but if you get off scot-free, it sends a message that you're the \"better\" child, so your parents will get to justify their double standards and shitty treatment of him, and it will make him feel like shit. It also enables your parents to have zero fucking boundaries and drug test their adult child.\n\nMy advice? Give them back the car. Get a job and save up to buy your own car. Don't let them use that as power over you. I know having a free car is convenient but if you do that you let them use that as a bargaining chip. And at this point I'd value my relationship with my brother over my relationship with them. Especially if you're aware you're treated like the \"golden child.\" Your brother shouldn't have ratted you out, but I can kind of understand his anger, getting punished for something you do too.\n\nBuy a beater car for a couple thousand and send a message to your parents that the shitty double standard and unfair treatment need to stop, and that you're an adult entitled to privacy. People like this will never stop being shitty as long as they have bargaining chips they can use to control others. Take that away from them.\n\nI will say that your parents are within their rights to ban him from smoking in their house/if he's gonna live in their house. Sucks, but that's how it goes when you live with your parents. But the rest of it -- including drug testing their adult daughter who lives out of state -- is fucking ridiculous. I'm also a proponent of paying for your own eduction (especially when you have shitty parents who lord this type of thing over you \u2014 mine didn't, but I am proud that I worked my ass off and paid my own way) but threatening to take college off the table over a little weed is fucking stupid.

            "I'm a 53 yo father of 2 teenagers, 16 and 18. I used to smoke a lot a very long time ago, before grad school.  Weed is legal in my state.\n\nFirst, your brother getting in trouble with his HS is enough. Your parents shouldn't be piling on him.  He's an adult, so they legally have no say in what he does. His school does because he goes there, and the state does depending on the law there which is 21+ or totally illegal. They can, however, take away his car if they pay for it, kick him out if their house, refuse to pay for his college.\n\nThey have no rights over you at all except that they can take your car. Personally, since you don't plan on smoking for a while, I'd firmly tell them that you need the car, so you will take the drug tests, but they are seriously infringing on your rights  as an adult and if they take action in any way against you for a positive test, they will suffer severe consequences. If they do, for example, take your car for a positive test or just telling them this, I'd walk, and cut them out of your life for a few years. You don't need that crap.\n\nBest of luck!",

        "selftext": "I wanted to give an update on my post from a few days ago since everyone who commented was so helpful.  \nI talked to my husband and asked him if he was taking testosterone as many of the commenters thought he was. He said no and was curious why I asked. So we talked a bit and I really pressed him hard on what was going through his mind a year ago to make him change so much and I was able to tease 2 things out of him.\n\nThe first was an incident at work. It happened about six months before he made his transformation and I knew about it at the time because he told me. He didn\u2019t make a really big deal about it and barely mentioned it after telling me so I just forgot it even happened until he mentioned it.\n\n  \nMy husband is a VP of Finance at a rather large private company and two members of his staff were engaging in an affair. The woman involved in the affair was married and about my age and her husband had started to call the office. So it became a thing he had to deal with since he was their boss. He told me at the time but I guess this saga dragged on for some months and when the woman in question began to open up to others in the office regarding the reason she had the affair, some of those reasons hit home for my husband. Her husband was behaving much like he was. So he said that isn\u2019t going to be me and set out to fix it.\n\n  \nThe second thing I teased out of him is that he quit watching porn. Now I do want to say that I don\u2019t care that he watched porn, I do myself on occasion. But when he watched it and obviously finished himself afterward, it drained any desire he had for me. I guess he started when the kids were really young and I was just exhausted all the time and he just kept it up because it was easy. He quit because to fix our marriage he had to get that desire back for me. So he did it.  \nSo after this conversation a lot of things make sense. I also understand why he didn\u2019t want to tell me. He didn\u2019t want me to think that the possibility that I could cheat had entered his mind. And the porn is sort of self explanatory.\n\n  \nORIGINAL POST:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cbk3cf/my\\_husband\\_turned\\_40\\_and\\_suddenly\\_became\\_the\\_man/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cbk3cf/my_husband_turned_40_and_suddenly_became_the_man/)  \nHi, I\u2019m new here. I create this account because something happened to my husband about a year ago and I don\u2019t know what to make of it.  \nMy husband has always been a good man, and he\u2019s a wonderful father. He also has a great career and very driven to succeed. But after the kids were born his passion for me had waned. He was once very affectionate and flirty and he couldn\u2019t keep his hands off me. We had date nights and would take weekend trips filled with kissing, hand holding and a lot of sex. But after the kids all of that began to fade and it continued to the point that I felt like we were roommates. I kept myself in shape for him and initiated sex often. He would never turn me down but it was lazy. It was basically get off quick and go to sleep. So after a while I just stopped imitating.  \nThis continued for years and I had just grown used to it. I still loved him, I had no desire to cheat or divorce. I just figured this is what happens after kids and I\u2019ll just deal with it.  \nThen, about a year ago he got a babysitter and asked me if I wanted to go away for the weekend just the two of us. I was shocked but agreed. And the entire weekend he was affectionate and flirty and just fun. He hadn\u2019t acted this way in years. He was a completely different guy and that included in the bedroom too. This may be TMI but my husband hadn\u2019t performed oral sex on me in 10 years and every time he had before he was kind of terrible at it. But while we were away he just did it without asking and he was amazing at it.  \nThis new attitude continued when we got home and a few months after that I started to notice that he had lost weight. Shortly after that he started to look more toned as well. He had gotten a dad bod but now he looked better than when we got married. I won\u2019t lie, I had difficulty keeping my hands off him.  \nHe\u2019s basically become the perfect husband overnight, I don\u2019t know what happened. He says he just wanted to be a better husband but there was no event that triggered it outside of turning 40. Could that be it?\n\nI\u2019ve read that middle aged men sometimes get in shape because they are looking to cheat. But that\u2019s not the case. He\u2019s never cheated or had any desire too. We have lifestyle 360 for the kids and I see where he is. It\u2019s work and home. I also see all his texts since we share an iPad.  \nSo I\u2019m kind of stumped.  \nTLDR: My husband suddenly became a perfect husband and I don\u2019t know why",

Like a friend was having issues with her husband's sisters and one of them told her she'd seen his profile on Tinder -- no one who knew him believed it. To the degree that we all burst out laughing. When was he Tindering? Between his job, childcare and World of Warcraft -- when? Plus, his phone was so old it wouldn't support the app. Some guys aren't cheating and you just *know* it. \n\nAnyway. So glad you talked about it. Congrats on your renewed marriage. Congrats on having a husband who took some initiative to improve your life together. Congrats to him on his self-awareness and forethought and emotional intelligence. Congrats to you for noticing and appreciating and acknowledging the change. I wish you guys the best.",

The classic madonna/wh*re complex.  Its a real thing. Unfortunately for men love can enhance sex...but it doesn't drive our sex drive.\n\nSo the combination of getting told no on top of seeing your wife wonderfully baby and nurse your child doesn't fire up the dirty mind sex drive to do all the shit you'd do before.",

There\u2019s lots of sections on here where (mostly) men discuss the issues you were experiencing where their wife has no interest in them any more. It hurts and it\u2019s horrible and it makes you feel utterly worthless and even dirty for trying something with someone who constantly rejects you when they are supposed to love you (especially when they weren\u2019t always like that)\n\nI\u2019m so pleased for you that things have sorted out and that you now have the relationship you deserved. It\u2019s lovely to hear\u00a0",
            "So happy for you and your husband.  My wife and I went through something similar around the time I turned 40.  It is unfortunate that it took your husband and I so many years and a wake-up moment to finally make some big changes.  It seems like 40 is around when many people finally have the time/energy for true introspection and change (after young kids and early career demands).  Not many are fortunate enough to have a partner who can remain patient and committed through the more challenging years.  I am sure he really treasures you and your relationship.  \n\nMy wife is a bit worried that we might slip back into old patterns at some point.  I hope you realize that the change in outlook your husband has gone through is not something that he will un-learn.  Porn can be an addiction, so there is danger of slip-ups on that part.  However, having you fully aware and available to help him avoid issues should be a game changer for him.  My wife never had issues with porn/masturbation in general.  She will still say things like she would never tell me to stop relieving myself.  However, that is exactly what I need/want from her.  I have made a decision to reserve my energy for her and our relationship and appreciate her support in helping me follow through on those commitments.  \n\nThose who have issues with porn addiction tend to have addictive tendencies in general.  Making sure there is a relatively healthy outlet is important.  My latest is commenting on reddit posts.",

            "This resonates.  I am 61, married to an amazing woman.  We both have had high stakes jobs for years.  In my very early 40s I went with her to a function at the hospital she worked at.  I didn\u2019t know many people there so I spent a lot of time people watching.  So many great looking people, very social, having a great time & here I was , 30 lbs overweight just feeling kind of invisible.  \nIt wasn\u2019t immediate, but that was the beginning of what became a \u201ctransformation\u201d of sorts.  The first thing I did was apologize to my wife for not paying enough attention to her, and letting myself go.  I also quit porn altogether.  I wasn\u2019t deep into it, but it hurt my wife deeply when she found out I was viewing it occasionally because she felt she wasn\u2019t enough for me.\nI started a fitness routine, lost some weight and generally felt better \nThe fitness aspect of all of this had such a positive impact on my mental health that I can\u2019t imagine not working out.\nThis was a gradual \u201ctransformation \u201c but it saved my life and it saved my marriage (although she has told me since the day we married that I could never get rid of her).\nIt\u2019s possible, you can change and have a long, happy and fulfilling marriage.  \nOP, your husband is committed.  I love this.  I chuckle at some of the comments about how he learned new skills, if you are committed, you figure it out.  \nBest of luck to you.",

            "Hi there, amazing update. Love it. May I ask what he saw the husband doing that made him change? Like what behaviours were similar to your husbands?",
            "It takes a whole lot for a man to change his ways and you really embraced that change. He liked the attention it got him too. Porn is a relationship killer and can really do damage too. I understand people watch it but in a marriage your focus should be your partner. Your really fantasizing with another person and it can really damage your relationship in the attraction department as this did for him. Honesty is best and I am glad you two can have honest communication with one another. Sound like also your husband is very private about how he works on himself and does not tout about it. These are great characteristics as a man know you got a good one. Good luck moving forward and happy bliss!",

I don't really want to make this update but since you guys made the time to comment, I guess you deserve an update. After the post a few months ago, he had read all of the comments and begged me not to leave him. He apologized and swore he would change. He didn't.\n\nWhen I made that post, I did not expect the comments to be unanimous in saying that he was abusive. And I slowly came around to that idea. Some of those comments were a huge wake up call for me, and I started realizing just how horrible I had been treated the entire relationship. Apologizing profusely for unwanted attention from men, swearing I would never be nice to them or even talk to them again, reassuring him that my outfit wasn't revealing. It was my first relationship and I just didn't know how abusive all of this was. I don't want to be with someone who controls and micromanages my social media, dictates what I wear and my hairstyles, accuses me of being unfaithful or doing slutty things for men, tells me \"I'm not going to have sex with you after we break up if you start adding other guys\", constantly lies about his feelings for women in his life, and much much more.\n\n2 nights ago he was bothering me because he wasn't responding to a question I'd asked him, and it was the straw that broke the camel's back. I broke up with him. We broke up via text because he always refused to meet me in person when I wanted to break up. I guess he thought if he refused to meet me in person to say goodbye then I would wait to break up with him, and he was right because it did deter me a few times (we live an hour away). But this time I knew he would be immature and not want to meet with me so I just had to message it to him which sucks, because it feels really awful to end a year and 4 months relationship via text.\n\nAll he had to do was try. The sad thing is, I know he wants to change and he wants to be with me, but he just can't bring himself to treat me right. No matter how trustworthy I was to him, he only ever saw me as the kind of girl who would run off with another guy the second she had a chance, a girl who loves male attention. No matter how much i was there for him and I tried everything to motivate him and comfort him through his struggles, he just couldn't force himself not to act in a way that he knew was wrong. Which was extreme jealousy, disrespect towards me, lying, cynicism towards all men and their intentions, and toxicity.\n\nThe past month I would just be disgusted with myself for letting myself be treated like that. Every day I would be resentful and think to myself, \"what the fuck am I doing with someone abusive who doesn't try for me, when (for the most part), I am a really good girlfriend to him?\" I know my worth now. I am a very generous and loving girl that I think a respectful and kind person would be lucky to have.\n\nI'm still having thoughts that it feels wrong to not be with him, and I feel guilty for having freedom and doing what I want. I really have struggled with guilt and anxiety from this breakup.\n\nAll in all I am truly thankful for the comments on the original post who I probably wouldn't be here without. So thank you. I feel free. I haven't even cried yet. I feel like I did the right thing even though I am really sad. I am finally putting myself first despite how hard it is. I know he will read this and I originally wrote something to him but I don't want to put more of his personal info on the internet than necessary. In the end he is not a horrible person by any means, nor is he a sociopath like someone said in the last post. It sucks things can't work out right now at least.\n\nTldr: he continued to be abusive and i finally grew a pair and left him. Learned to never stay with someone who doesn't match your effort.\n\nedit: thanks so much you guys for the comments, i cant reply to them all. you really give me strength which i lack so much of right now. i know i did the right thing even though it feels wrong and pretty miserable right now. so thank you for the reassurance... every comment honestly does make me feel better.",

But when I got in my next relationship with an actual nice man I had certain hang ups which you may find too - for example I was overly-apologetic about everything (because I had been trained to be that way) so I had to tell my new boyf that he needed to reassure me that it was fine and nothing further would be said on the matter because if he was like \u2018uh? Whatever?\u2019 my anxiety would go through the damn roof waiting for him to throw my (completely innocent) action back in my face. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible for you to go to therapy (so many people recommend it here with no thought to the availability or affordability) but they will also be able to teach you coping techniques for dismantling his abuse. \n\nI\u2019m going to echo a comment on your original post which was advice to read \u2018why does he do that\u2019 by Lundy Bancroft. It\u2019s a book written by a guy who has acted as a therapist/counsellor to abusive men for many years but the book is written for victims. It helped me process what happened to me and get a sense of closure around the events.

The biggest thing is that he doesn't seem to have ever had this level of empathy for you.\n\nIn the meantime, please go absolutely no contact for at least some length of time.

            ">  The sad thing is, I know he wants to change and he wants to be with me, but he just can't bring himself to treat me right.  \n\nHe doesn't want to change. If he wanted to change he would. He doesn't like or respects women, he likes sex with women and using them as his emotional and mental punching bag, but he doesn't actually like or respects women. That much is clear from the way he treated you. If he liked and respected women he would be able to treat you as if he respected and liked you. He didn't love you, he didn't even like you. \n\nThe way he treated you was not about YOU as a person, it was all about his lack of like & respect for women period. He will treat EVERY woman he's with the same, because he doesn't like, trust or respect women. You didn't do anything wrong to cause his behavior, every way he spoke to you and treated you was a choice that shows you exactly who he is.\n\n> In the end he is not a horrible person by any means \n\nHe IS a horrible person. Horrible people don't always hurt others in big dramatic ways, they do it in little ways which slowly destroy someone. They manipulate and control, they get off on abuse, they're selfish and petty and mean. He was all of those things and did all of those things. He is horrible, and you should pity any woman who ever has anything to do with him. \n\nIf he wasn't a horrible person, if he was just hurting or didn't know any better, once he realized how much he was hurting you and how wrong he was he would have WORKED to change. But he didn't, he just manipulated you with crocodile tears and lies and kept on being himself.\n\nGlad you finally broke free. Better luck in future, at least you know some of the red flags to look for. Don't ever be with someone who doesn't respect, trust and like you, even if they say nice words like \"I love you\".\n\n&#x200B;",

I gave him a final year of my life, an irreplaceable year of precious and finite time in addition to the 5 years I'd given previously, and there was no change. I left him, filed for divorce, and moved on with my life.\n\nIt's been nearly 20 years. I get regular updates from the now adult kids whether I want them or not. He's behaving in exactly the same ways he did back then. The only difference is that now he's someone else's problem and I'm free.",
            "The reason he was seeing all men as predators is because he is a predator.  He looks at women the way he was saying men are looking at you.  He wanted you to be as invisible and unappealing as possible, because he was afraid that either you would talk to a normal guy and realize that most men do not police their girlfriends the way he does, or that you would get sucked in by another predator like him.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m so glad that you realized that you are not a possession or a child, and that dressing and acting like a normal person doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s your fault if men look at you.  You weren\u2019t encouraging them.  You weren\u2019t trying to attract their attention by existing.  Make sure you learn from this experience, and don\u2019t let any other men get away with treating you this badly.\n\n\n\nAlso, keep your eyes open.  Whenever men are this obsessive and controlling, you need to be careful that once you break up they don\u2019t move on to stalking you.  Be aware of your surroundings, try not to go out alone especially at night, tell friends and family to not give him any information about you, and block him everywhere.

I feel heartbroken for you, because I know how tough things were for you and will be until you heal. The relationship I\u2019m referring to lasted 3 1/2 years, and began when I was 15. Ended when I was 18 and it\u2019s been over a year now since the break up. \n\nIt\u2019s like things just build up and build up until you can\u2019t physically, mentally, and emotionally handle it anymore and you just snap and have to break up with the person; no matter how much you love them and don\u2019t want to. The human mind can only take so much. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re putting yourself and your happiness first. This goes to anyone out there who is struggling in a toxic relationship: Remember that you\u2019re the one who has to live in your own mind. Make yourself happy.

He wants control and he always will. He may not be doing it maliciously, it may be the trauma he\u2019s faced and his trust issues causing him to act like this, but that does not mean that he\u2019s not abusing you. He needs therapy to work through these issues, not you. I\u2019ve been in the same situation and nothing felt better than realizing the truth, but it took time. Give yourself the time. But stay away from him. ",
            "Married 46 years, cheated on three times before I got married. All I can say from my personal experience and what I have seen with other couples we have known for the last 50 years. With a 50+% divorce rate, something like what you describe brings those odds close to 100%, so why waste time with a guy you have no future with. I know the type. They are the king and are allowed to fool around with other girls and go out with friends to bars and clubs, but not their wives who are expected to be faithfully waiting for them at home. There are so many nice guys out there, so it constantly amazes me why girls cannot tell the difference between them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLove does blind you to your partner\u2019s faults which is one of the reasons so many blissfully enter into a marriage that has a better chance to fail than succeed when they would not board an airplane with a 50% chance of crashing.  When courtship type love (the kind we feel at first) goes away and you see your mate, warts and all, that is when you decide to continue or leave, hence the reason why most get divorced 2-3 years after they marry. My wife and I used to bet which of our friends and family will not make it long in their relationships, and we were right every single time\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce I was listening to the fianc\u00e9 of my wife\u2019s workplace friend telling me how he is banging girls by telling his fianc\u00e9 he is out with his friends. Why would he tell me, a stranger whose wife was a friend of his fianc\u00e9. He was one of those guys who felt that men could do what they want, but not women. He saw nothing wrong with what he was doing guy to guy. It was an expensive divorce for him when his wife found out. Be smart and don\u2019t date losers. Dating is like test driving cars before you buy one. Make sure you get the make and model you want with all the extras that will make you happy and not settle for a model that just has the minimum needed.",

Your first post was just a huge list of manipulative abusive red flags. \n\nGood riddance! Never look back. That wasn't a healthy relationship at all, and when you find someone great you'll look back on this and understand how different an equal relationship really looks.\n\nSo for now, go and enjoy life!

            "I re-read the original post, and will read the comments after I type this. \n\nI am amazed how many relationships where someone says, you can't talk/hang out with the opposite sex.  I have multiple married female friends, and multiple times, I have met up with one at a Starbucks or a very cheap restaurant and we go dutch.  That is how to handle that type of friendship.  \n\nYou are young, you will find someone that trusts you and doesn't tell you who to talk to, or to hang out with.  ",
            "People who want to change will put the effort into it. He wasn't even showing effort. He DID NOT \u201cwant to change.\u201d\n\nAnd I think classic abusers ARE narrowly focused narcissists or sociopaths. They fit the entire symptom list. Including the part about appearances hugely sincere and charming. They tend to fool everyone. He fooled you, at least for a while. Thank god you got out when you did, when his true self began showing. ",
            "I think you underestimate the crocodile tears that an abuser can whip up when you said he wasn't a sociopath. There's peple that fuck up and then gaslight you to make you feel sorry for them and pretend it's not their fault to get you to stay. My ex of 5 years was like that and he ended uo knocking me up by rape while he was publicly dating another girl and isolating me so much i didnt even know. People who show these reds flags are not usually good people trying to change. I'm glad you got out anyway and I hope maybe perspective will help you find peace",

You're still learning how to \"adult,\" and I think you're both going to come out of the relationship having learned something about yourselves, and about other people.\n\nIt'll hurt for a while in the short term, but long-term, you will hopefully both take the lessons forward and have successful relationships in the future.\n\nGood luck to you both!",
            "The next step is a doozy! You think the next guy that treats you like a human is a good guy but remember, your boyfriend wasn't crazy day 1 either. They bait and switch you. Even guys that seem sweet in the first few months can slowly turn into this. Maintain healthy boundaries. It is not your job to fix anyone or help them come around, the reality is that you never will, you only ever end up chipping yourself away while you try.\n\nVery often women exit an abusive relationship and enter another abusive one but they think that it isn't because it is slightly better than the last.\n\nAnd finally, low self esteem makes you compulsively feel like you have to go above and beyond to be a good partner. Being a girlfriend doesn't mean going above and beyond, if anything that just makes your partner comfortable doing less. And when you lean back into just being a regular good girlfriend either they notice that you aren't going above and beyond and complain, or they just never get it up to meet you in the middle and you sadly realize that it wasn't sustainable and efforts to change it don't make a difference. You have nothing to make up for. ",
            "> he only ever saw me as the kind of girl who would run off with another guy the second she had a chance, a girl who loves male attention.\n\nNo, not you. This is how he sees ALL women. He doesn't respect them, or you (he kinda sounds like a red piller, which, ew). He thinks they are property to control. And just because he's a perv, he assumes everyone is. Just because he can't be trusted, he assumes no one can.\n\nI dated an abuser like this. You know how you would cry remembering the guy he was when you first started dating, the guy who wooed you and was so respectful? That guy was the act. The shitty abuser? That was the real him. That's how abusers operate. Because they'd never get a partner to abuse if they showed their true colors from the start. No, they lure you by being charming, sweet, the perfect partner. And then when they've got you convinced, they start with the controlling, abusing bullshit. They'd never get anyone to stay and put up with it if they didn't do the Mr. Perfect act at the start. And you think if you are \"perfect\" enough, they'll go back to being the sweet guy they were at the beginning. But that guy never existed, it was all a fake.\n\n> In the end he is not a horrible person by any means, nor is he a sociopath like someone said in the last post. \n\nYou're wrong; only a horrible person would treat you the way he did. Good people don't act that way. He doesn't really want to change; if he did, he would have. He knew he was treating you horribly, and he kept doing it. Because that's who he is. Don't delude yourself. There is something very, very wrong with him. Otherwise he wouldn't behave so psychotically. To the ex boyfriend: You need help. A lot of it. None of your behavior is normal. None of it is loving. None of it is OK, no matter what shitty excuses you have for your behavior. People are allowed to look at your girlfriend. That's part of living in the world. Getting so psychotically upset about it is not normal. Controlling the way another adult dresses, where they go, who they see ... it's not normal. It's not OK. It's totally fucked up. Get help before you even consider dating again, because you're an abuser, and you're an awful person.\n\n>  I feel guilty for having freedom and doing what I want. I really have struggled with guilt and anxiety from this breakup.\n\nI went through this too when I finally escaped from my abuser. The freedom ... it was too much at first. Not walking on eggshells. Not being afraid of pissing someone off all the time just by living. That's not normal. Therapy probably would have helped, and is a good idea for you. The good news is, that dumping his emotionally abusive ass freed me up to find the guy I married. He's amazing. He's sweet, he's kind, he's proud of me, he makes me feel awesome about myself (instead of cutting me down and making me cry all the time). If he sees a guy looking at me, he tells me, \"Hell yeah, of course guys are going to look at my girl, you're hot.\" He's proud to be with me, he trusts me completely (and knows he's the only one I'd ever want). He likes it when I dress up and we go out -- he says he's showing me off. If a guy talks to me, he doesn't get upset because he's not insecure. He's my best friend in the world and he encourages me to go out with my friends and have fun (and my friends love him). Because that's what a good partner does: They want the person they love to be happy and have fun. The best decision I ever made was leaving my controlling ex and I'm so grateful I did so I could be with my husband. Having such a shitty ex also makes me appreciate how awesome my husband is. I have literally had nightmares about being back with my ex. Thank god he's gone.",

He had 4 brothers, one who had moved out andd 3 younger. They shared 2 bedrooms, so when we went to bed we shared his and his brother was across the room. He guilted me into my first time and every time after that. I cried every time we had sex and if I told him I didn't want to he would ignore me and go play wow as punishment. He wanted me to only dress in loli-goth clothes and regularly told me that my boobs were too big. (I was only a b-cup at the time) and that I should bandage them down. \n\nIt took a year and a half before a friend made me take my blinders off. He was a racist, sexually abusive asshole and I wasn't happy.

            "coming in here late and wow! so proud of you leaving a bad, red flag relationship! i know it feels weird, its how he warped your thoughts,  but you will come back to yourself, and wiser. \n\nremember you knew enough to ask us, and you knew our responses were right, snd you know its a better life without him. stay strong; sometimes abusers come back, because they are actually very weak & dependent & desperately need someone to push around to make themselves feel ok.  you don\u2019t need that anymore. \n\n\n\none comment specific to what you wrote; referring to yourself as girl. i think you might be naturally submissive, and in looking for a \u2018take-charge\u2019 kind of guy, you got an abusive one. theres a difference between domineering [ bad] and dominant,   a dominant kind of person would respect you by protecting you with consent. a domineering person doesn\u2019t care about consent. a dominant person would offer some return for the control thats given to them; actual care, respect, honesty & integrity in the relationship.  so something to keep in mind as you continue to move forward. ",
            "You learned in four months what took me four years to learn. And some don\u2019t learn at all. ",
            "Sad im in this kinda situation myself...except opposite.\n\nShe's going to therapy to at least show me an effort, i just hope something changes...\n\nHope all goes well!",
            "You did the right thing- the sadness will pass, one day you\u2019ll look back and be so happy with yourself for being strong and leaving. Going forward- constant jealousy is a HUGE red flag. People automatically assume that their partners will behave like they do- if someone is honest and trustworthy, they assume that their partner is too. If someone is constantly jealous and accusing you of cheating, you can bet on it that they\u2019re cheating on you. You deserve someone that treats you with love and respect, don\u2019t settle for less. Congrats on finding your strength:)",
            "It's normal to miss him and even feel guilty, I'd suggest some counseling to deal with these feelings and what will be residual from this experience as it will help you move in a more positive and healthy direction. Good for you for being so strong and respectful of yourself because in the end that's what really matters! ",
            "> The sad thing is, I know he wants to change and he wants to be with me, but he just can't bring himself to treat me right\n\nThe thing he, he doesn't want to change for the right reasons. If he did, he would have tried harder over the past year and four months. The entire basis of your relationship was built on his controlling behavior, and it sounds like that's how it always has been. And that's how it always will be. \n\nThe reason he wants to change *right now*, however, is because he is suffering consequences. But if you two got back together, you would inevitably end right back where you left off.\n\nWhen I was exactly your age, I was in a painfully similar relationship. He was so convinced I was someone I was not and assumed that interacting with men at all meant I might just miraculously fall onto someone else's dick by accident. But I stuck around because all the above, to me, meant he was crazy about me. And crazy was right.",
            "now comes the hard part. going \"no contact\" so he doesn't worm his way back into your life begging for a second chance. stay strong.",
            "I know you've got a million comments here, but I just want to say: I'm so, so proud of you. You are stronger than you know. It is so easy, especially at your young age, to confuse sadness with \"wrongness\"(and thus try to repair a toxic relationship) and feelings of love with \"rightness\" and it can take people twice your age a lot longer to free themselves from a toxic situation than it took you. Abusers are really, really good at what they do..and they are also humans with other traits, ones that can make people who are loving and sympathetic want to stay. Someday you will see the way a healthy relationship looks, and it'll be so, so different than what you just experienced (and I say this from tons of experience). Stay strong, and know that you made so many of us so super proud.",
            "\u201eThings can\u2019t work out *right now* at least\u201c? I know you want to think that he is a good person but he isn\u2019t. He is sexist and abusive. Don\u2019t hold out hope for getting back together with him. Just cut all contact with this guy and remove him from your life forever.\nYou are kind and generous, loyal and trustworthy, and I am very sure that you are stunning if so many men hit on you. You are a catch. You can have a guy who not only doesn\u2019t control, demean, insult, mistrusts, and abuses you, but who lifts you up, supports you, loves you, buys you flowers, doesn\u2019t cheat on you emotionally and doesn\u2019t lie to you. \nYour ex boyfriend is an abusive liar. He can go get fucked. ",
            "I\u2019m so glad you broke up with him even though it\u2019s difficult and painful.\n\nAlso\u2014\n\n1.\tNothing you do excuses his bad behavior. Don\u2019t excuse abuse because you\u2019re not perfect. *Nobody* is. You\u2019re a good person and deserving of respect.\n\n2.\tHair styles aren\u2019t sexual. That\u2019s ridiculous. I do understand why you\u2019d go along with that. I just want to point this out so other women don\u2019t think this is ok. If it\u2019s a religious belief, it\u2019s still not ok. Jesus said that men are responsible for their sexual thoughts. Islam also teaches something similar. You can dress modestly as a sign of respect to other men to help them not sin, but the onus is on them. No matter what you wear. Controlling your wardrobe and hair is a red flag for abuse.So is lots of negative comments about the way other women dress. It\u2019s none of their business and a sign of victim blaming, No women deserve that.",
            "Really glad you got out of there. You seriously need to go no contact because it sounds like you may be willing to get back together next time he hits you with a sob story. If he wanted to change, he would. It's REALLY easy to not micromanage another person's life. \n\nI've never been in a situation quite as bad but in my experience, the worst part of these toxic relationships is that this insane controlling behavior becomes the new normal. By the end, you start getting mad at stupid stuff that you shouldn't get mad at. You start getting bothered when they don't follow a schedule. You start feeling guilty even if you did nothing wrong. Your SO having trust issues is not a license to make your life hell. Everyone's been hurt before. \n\nNowadays, I really don't entertain it anymore. You either trust me or you don't. If you don't, then we can stop wasting time and end it. Don't have the time or energy for all of the stuff that comes with it. ",
            "Happy to hear you've broken up! I'm sure it wasn't easy - just my two cents:\nNobody sets out to be in an abusive relationship. You end up in one because the person knows how to act nice and woo you, and once you're in love, they are comfortable demanding more and more ridiculous things and only put in the minimum effort to keep you - eg. treating you like that but when you want to leave, he suddenly says all the right things again, about how he's going to change. Because you're a good person and because you still hold on to that guy he showed you when you just met, you believe him and find it hard to just leave. There's always the \"what if he DOES change, it would be so great\". That's normal. That's how people end up in abusive relationships. It doesn't happen over night, it's a slow process of normalizing things (\"me telling you what to post on social media is normal in relationships!\") - Don't beat yourself up over your actions. Leaving was hard. Even now, it's ok to be sad and miss what could've been. But it's also important that you remind yourself that it WAS indeed abusive, be proud that you managed to end it - and in the future, treat those things like the red flags they are. Don't tolerate this behaviour even one second.\n\nAnd you're right, someone who loves you would never do those things. They'd want you to express yourself, to have friends (whether male or female), to be the best version of yourself. And if that made them insecure and controlling, they would actively work on that before you could ever even say smth, bc they would want better for you. Maybe he loved you, but what he loved more than you is the control and power he had over you. He was so insecure that he enjoyed putting you down to feel better about himself (like saying it's your fault guys stare at you and making you feel bad/apologize). That's heartbreaking, but now you know not to tolerate this. Like the saying goes, believe someone's actions, not their words.\n\nAlso: it's okay to be single. Enjoy it. No need to rush into dating again - actually it would probably better if you didn't, so you can truly process this relationship and have a healthy one the next time around.",
            "I'm so proud of you.\n\nRelish this moment. Finally being free of an abusive relationship is a wonderful feeling. When you have the time and feel ready for it, I would encourage you to pick up Lundy Bancroft's book \"Why Does He Do That?\". It's online as a pdf if you can't set aside the money for a hard copy. It's a very good read for people who have been in abusive relationships. \n\nIt's also not a bad idea to consider talking to the people you love about this relationship. Therapy can also be good if you find yourself exhibiting trauma symptoms-- you might not, but you're not weak if you do! \n\nBut that's all a little bit into the future. For now, just enjoy your new abuse-free life. :) Rooting for you! ",
            "I can't wait until you get to the rage stage, you do absolutely brilliant things then ",
            "I applaud your courage to get out before you fell even deeper into that rabbit hole. You got this. ",
            "I think there's one thing you got wrong about him in particular.  It's not that how he sees you affected his behavior. It's how he sees himself.  Dudes with a lot of insecurities that make them feel like they need to have absolute control over others before they can trust them.  Like most fear, it comes from a place of weakness. ",
            "Your ex boyfriend reminds me of myself. I was an abusive and controlling boyfriend back in the day until she left me for good. It was a huge wake call for me for being an asshole. As a result, I becoming a better person day by day and hopefully I find love again soon. Getting tired of the meaningless night stands",
            "First of all, good for you, it seems that you made the right decision based on everything you said. According to what you stated, he has extreme jealousy issues that are very difficult if not near impossible to change from within a relationship. It's difficult to recognize when a relationship is bad for you, especially when you care about the person so much. You did well.\n\nThat said, I just wanted to address the plethora of comments on here completely demonizing this guy. Is he a jealous, controlling person? Yes. But people are talking about him as if he's the scum of the Earth, and Beyond any compassion. He needs help. Yes, he treated you horribly, and you should not be in a relationship with him. However, being jealous and controlling is indicative of insecurity which is brought on by issues he's dealing with. He is a victim, as well, of his own insecurities. People who feel insecure don't enjoy the feeling of insecurity. They don't choose to feel insecure. And when this results in them being controlling and jealous, they have difficulty being self-aware that what they're doing is wrong. It's a mental health issue, and just because he's victimizing somebody else, that doesn't mean he isn't also a victim himself. It also doesn't mean that he is some evil Puppet Master.\n\nWhat this situation needs is understanding and compassion from all angles. It's not a relationship that should have continued, and his actions are not acceptable, but the comments I've seen talking about this guy as if he's a lost cause psychopath isn't the best way to go about this. It needs to be made clear that what he's doing was completely wrong, but it's not okay to treat him like a rabid dog.",

I get that jealousy is a good thing in relationships but sometimes it become like cancer and lead to trust issue..\n\nYou are too young live your life and I hope you find someone kind and far better than Your ex a year ago.\n\nExcuse my language, English its not my native :\"(",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Senior colleague hired his wife to join my team and she sucks, how do I manage the relationship with her and minimise collateral damage to my own relationship with other colleagues who are friends with her?\n\n...\n\nDetails:\n\nI work for a small company with 11 employees, soon to be 16. I like my job and most everyone I work with, bar one member of the senior team I'll call Gavin \\[40M\\]. Gavin isn't the top of the food chain but he has a lot of clout, as the CEO really likes him and handpicked him to join the company based on their past relationship.\n\nMost of the people at my company have worked with each other before in past roles or know each other personally. Hiring friends is the norm, though I'm one of the few \"outsiders\". This hasn't been an issue at all up until recently, when Gavin hired his wife Donna \\[F39\\] to work part time at the company and asked her to work on some of my projects without consulting me first. I only found out she was going to share projects with me on the day she started.\n\nUnfortunately, Donna is not experienced nor naturally talented in the work she's been assigned. She's been insecure, needy and anxious from day one, and lacks the basic skills necessary to do her job well. I've tried to help her adjust because I would actually welcome some help with my workload, but she pulls me into meetings for an hour or two every time she's in the office, asking me really basic questions and/or just quietly panicking at me. She also does this with CEO, who she knows personally through Gavin.\n\nI've tried to pull away a little bit by not responding instantly to her Slack messages and not accepting every meeting she's tried to book with me. The result has been that she's started interrupting me in meetings, asking basic but usually inappropriate questions addressed to me. I don't think she's intentionally undermining me because she's always grateful when I 'help' her but I'm finding it hard to stay patient. Gavin, of course, always chimes in to support her in team settings.\n\nI've also tried to build my 1:1 relationship with Donna so there's enough trust to establish boundaries, but unfortunately I can't really find much common ground with her. She's quite negative, complaining loudly that no one at the company has their shit together and I feel like she probably says the same things about me to her husband and the CEO outside the office.\n\nThere are very subtle signs that the CEO may be starting to realise hiring her wasn't a great idea - if she wasn't Gavin's wife I think she'd definitely be on her way out, so I think my best strategy here is to wait this out and try to stay calm. However, the CEO booked a 1:1 with me next week and if he asks me about Donna I'm not sure what I'll say. I feel the resentment growing, not just at Gavin and Donna, but also at the CEO for not establishing a fair work environment.\n\nI don't want to ruin my place in the company over this. My question is, how do I handle Donna while covering my own ass? And what should I say if asked about what I think of Donna's work?\n\n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*: Whoa, this blew up. Thanks all for your comments and advice - I just read everything. To clarify a few things:\n\n1. Donna isn't my direct report. We don't have managers at our company, so technically no one is. I wasn't asked to train her, but when I found out on her first day she'd been told to \"support\" some of my projects I sort of had to step in.\n2. I don't know if the CEO is going to talk about Donna in our meeting, but I don't like being caught off guard so I'm thinking more 'what if?'\n3. She doesn't have a JD or even a title, so I understand her anxiety to some extent as our environment is pretty chaotic. Given her personal connections I told her she could probably just define her own role and give herself any title she wants, but she hasn't done it.\n4. I don't ignore her messages, I've just stopped responding \\*immediately\\* because it fucks up my focus\n5. I'm not the only person she's doing this to. She naturally also books Gavin into long meetings and also the CEO . She's the only one who gets this level of attention from the senior team in the company and it's not really sustainable in any case\n6. The work I've tried to help her do is still substandard, which is mainly what's worrying me, and she doesn't really have the right mindset for this type of business that I've seen. She might get away with it as just an average employee in a big company, but in this setting it's glaringly obvious.\n\nShe's made references a few times that she's been near quitting from stress, so I really don't want to get any more involved in this unless I have to. I don't want to get her fired. But her flailing around, taking up my time is indeed disruptive to my ability to get things done, especially right now because I have additional project work on top of my daily responsibilities. I would just talk to her but I'm afraid she'll take it totally the wrong way because she's so wound up, and I already have a not great relationship with her husband so I don't want any of that backsplash.\n\nI think my best case scenario is that the CEO takes over her coaching completely if he wants her to stay. I don't feel like I can really ask for that directly but maybe I could angle for it.",

            "My advice: Be honest but tactful, and focus on the impact to your work. Even though she's obviously frustrating as hell, don't share that. Say things like, \"It's hard for me to spend the time I need on my own tasking when Donna is asking me to meet with her several hours a day; for example, on both Tuesday and Wednesday I sat with her for ninety minutes answering questions. Is there a better way for me to be handling that?\" \"The document she produced needed an extra two hours of editing before we could give it to the client.\" Act in the manner that you aren't complaining, simply giving him information about how things are going and if this is what he wants then that's fine with you. \n\nAnd if he indicates that he doesn't want to hear negative things, then stop going down that road for your own sake. But you can't expect him to fix things if nobody has told him what needs fixing - you need to give him a chance to be a good manager until you see that he's not going to take that chance.",
            "Don't go into this unprepared. This meeting may also be in your performance. Have you missed any deadlines? The wife may have complained that you aren't taking the time to train her. I would have a list and length of all the meetings you've attended with her and a list of the ones you denied and what you were working on that you felt it was necessary to deny them.\n\nedited to say - I don't mean take a list in with you obviously. Just have the info at your disposal in case you need to make a rebuttal to her claiming you are unhelpful.",
            "You have the right idea, play it cool for the time being let her incompetence do the work for you. Do your best to maintain a good and helpful relationship (this is for your benefit, not hers). If asked in your 1:1 about her, phrase things in the most positive and helpful way you can but be truthful (these are not mutually exclusive). \n\nI have learned the hard way that in situations like this, being \"right\" is not enough to protect you from fall out from going up against a nepotistic hire.",
            "With being interrupted in meetings, I used to have an assistant like that. The only thing that worked was to say \"hey, I'm in a meeting right now, we'll talk later,\" like a stuck record every time he tried asking a question or saying it would only take a second or whatever.\n\nI think what I would do at this point is set up a regular meeting slot with her- daily, weekly, every other day, w/e- and then turn down any meeting requests outside of it. If she keeps asking to meet, just tell her your next meeting with her is on [DATE].\n\nIf she asks questions, ask what she thinks she should do (quickest way I've found to redirect stuff like this!) And if she complains to you about people, just make the most noncommittal response possible- or 'oh, that's odd, X doesn't strike me as being so bad', and then go back to work.\n\nIn terms of what to say to the CEO, be cautious. Don't say anything about her unless he asks, and ideally wait until you have a sense of how he's feeling before he says anything at all. Point out specific things, and make it clear that you've discussed them with her or otherwise tried to work on it before bringing them to his attention. \n\nSo rather than \"She's increasing my workload', say that she still needs a lot more support than someone at her level would be expected to, and that that's eating into your time. Tell him that she's repeatedly interrupting meetings and other work despite being asked not to. Mention specific instances where the work she's produced hasn't been up to scratch and what impact that has had.\n\nAlso, I would suggest job hunting. You don't want to work for a company with that level of nepotism, because it *will* bite you in the ass at some point.",
            "Diarise your interactions with her: time/date/nature of interaction. When CEO asks, show him your diary. You needn\u2019t give your opinion, he should be able to deduce from the length and nature of the interaction whether it\u2019s a good use of his employees\u2019 time.\n\nIt isn\u2019t your job throw her under the bus. But you can offer unbiased accounts of your interactions with her.",
            "Could you not direct her to books, courses, tutorials, videos, or other training to help her with the things she should be able to do but can't? So the next time she asks something you have already explained, or which is something that she should have known coming into this role, you can say: \"Sorry but I really don't have time to teach you this, but you could take this (online) course to learn about this topic as well as other things relevant to your role.\"\n\nI would be honest in your 1to1 but perhaps more by asking questions:\n\n* I was not told about this hire until the morning she started, so I had no chance to prepare. Why is that?\n* What exactly is her background? I wasn't given the opportunity to review her CV.\n* Is she going to be taking some courses or formal training, because I think she could really benefit from that.\n* She's frequently requested to meet me to ask very basic things that I think someone starting her job should know about. I am happy to teach people but so far it's taken quite a lot of time out of my week to train her (mention number of hours if you can, or a ballpark number such as 'around 10 h a week') and I feel it's affecting the time I have for my other tasks. How many hours a week are you happy for me to allocate to training her?\n* I think she's not very used to our company culture as she's started to interrupt me when I am in meetings. What is the best way to bring her up to speed with our office culture?",

What is the purpose of the 1:1? Are these normal in your workplace or is this a random occurrence?",
            "I think you should stop ignoring her on slack or with meeting requests. Perhaps set up one or two weekly meetings with her, set a firm time limit for them, and when she approaches you at other times, say, \"we will discuss this on Tuesday during our check-in.\" \n\nRegarding how to talk *about* her work to your superiors, that's trickier. I would approach any problems you have with her from a perspective of, \"I would like your advice on how to manage this so that we can work together more effectively, and here are the challenges I am facing with her,\" not from a perspective of complaining about her. This is assuming that she has not done anything really terrible.",
            "I think you should approach the situation and what you can do to make things better.\n\nE.g. \u201cI\u2019m finding it hard to balance my workload and meetings whilst training new people, what do you think I can be doing better?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is how we\u2019ve been interacting as far as meetings etc are concerned, I\u2019m worried my approach isn\u2019t working best, how do you want me to handle it?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s totally fine to explain there\u2019s an issue as long as you take responsibility for it in the first instance and ask for his guidance and how to do things differently. It\u2019s win win for you - you\u2019re following his direct orders and advice, so doing what he wants, and if it backfires it\u2019s on him and the situation and not on you. This is how I\u2019ve handled a tough situation at my new job and it\u2019s worked great.",
            "I would definitely bring it up in the 1:1 meeting if the boss brings it up. I don't think its wise to say anything about the prospect of letting her go because that seems like an overstep, but I would talk about how its affecting your work and ability to do your job productively. She's still asking questions that a beginner would have mastered by now and indicate that she's not developing in her role at the pace you would have expected. She interrupts you which affects your focus and disrupts your meetings with other coworkers/clients. \n\nApart from what you might say in the meeting, maybe a helpful instruction you could give her would be to try and figure out the answers to her questions for 15 minutes before she comes to you.  Ive heard of big companies like Google doing this because it increases productivity. Just say that you think it will help her learn better to try it herself and then that could help get her off your back for a while. Good luck!",
            "\u201cShe\u2019s a unique hire, definitely have a lot to learn should she decide to stay long term. I believe she would do a lot better with her husband training her than she does with me.\u201d \n\nMeanwhile, start looking at other jobs. Whenever this blows up, and it will from the way you\u2019ve described your interaction with her, her husband will point his fingers at you since he assigned her to you. He will try to cover his ass, so you need to as well.",
            "OP, who do you report to and who does Donna report to? This is relevant to your approach here.\n\nIf you report to the CEO, then you should have the type of relationship with him that would allow you to be truthful, although you should still approach it like a formal performance review.\n\nIf you don\u2019t report to the CEO, then you need to discuss this with your manager ASAP. If he or she is anything close to decent then they should try to help you out and protect you from potential fallout.",
            "I'm not really sure on the reporting chain here. Who does Donna report to? \n\nI think the danger here to you is that it appears that there's some expectation that you'll train her and that's clearly not happening, and it looks like there's expectation that you'll be managing her, and you aren't. I think ignoring her Slack messages and not accepting meetings lends credence this and I think this is a possible problem for you. To be honest, I am not sure whether this situation reads as \"OP has a grudge against her employee and isn't capable of managing her\" or \"OP is managing a bad employee.\" \n\nIn my career, I have seen managers who struggle with the concept of onboarding people. This is especially true when its not \"your\" hire. In your case, it seems like you're scared of upsetting the political situation, so you're letting this linger and get out of hand.\n\nNot every new employee is a rock star whether there is nepotism or not. By definition, most employees are just average. If you're in a managerial position, your role is to:\n\n* Do your best to set people up for success\n* Set performance standards and hold employees to those expectations\n* Give them feedback, so they know how they are doing (good or bad)\n* Performance manage them\n\nGenerally, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. Not checking off those boxes makes it look like you're the problem.\n\nMy questions would be:\n\n* How is she failing? Can you cite specific instances where she's failed? Is she missing deadlines, producing work that isn't up to par, or what? Importantly, what documented conversations have you had with her about the quality of her work? You need to provide measurable performance standards.\n* If she's asking too many questions, what has her training looked like? Have **you** adequately prepared your employee to do the work? Have you taken adequate steps to train her and she's still failing? More importantly, can you defend your definition of \"adequate training\" to your CEO, or will he look at what you've done and say \"You're failing as a manager?\"\n* If she's asking questions at inappropriate times, or trying to over collaborate, then have you given her this feedback and is that documented?\n* Do you have a standing meeting scheduled? That provides a place to talk and get her questions answered in a structured way, which should cut down on interruptions\n\nFor example, the next time she interrupts your meeting to ask you a question, do the following:\n\n* Take her out of the room\n* Explain to her that you're in the middle of a meeting and its not appropriate to interrupt other meetings unless its vitally urgent\n* Tell her that, moving forward, she should either send you something in Slack or wait until your meeting is finished to ask her question, and if the question is a \"blocker,\" she should work on another task until she can talk with you\n* If its a question she should know the answer to, then say \"And we've talked about this question already, so my expectation is that you should be capable of handling that task on your own by now\" and give her a definite date/time and way she can demonstrate competency here \n* Give her a chance to ask any questions about the feedback you've just given her\n* Return to your meeting, apologize to the people in the room. If they are manager level or above, explain that you are coaching her on her over-collaboration issues.\n* After your meeting, send an email summarizing your conversation. Something like:\n\n>Hello Donna,  \n>  \n>I just wanted to summarize our conversation in the hallway, just to confirm that we're both on the same page. Moving forward, please refrain from interrupting me when I'm in a meeting, as this is disruptive to our team.   \n>  \n>My expectation is that, if you have a question and I'm unavailable, that you work on other things until I'm available, and that you're able to manage your own workflow in an efficient manner.  \n>  \n>Additionally, I want you to handle tasks independently when possible, and my expectation is that you can complete your work on your own, without my direct supervision. This task, in particular, we've reviewed on A, B, and C dates, and my expectation is that you should be able to complete it on your own now.   \n>  \n>Next week, I'd like you to take a stab at completing this task on your own. When you're done, bring it to me and we'll review it together to make sure everything is right. Please have this done by Thursday, and schedule 30 minutes for us to sit down together.   \n>  \n>Please let me know if you have any concerns or would like to discuss this further.  \n>  \n>Thanks,  \n>  \n>StrangeMistake5\n\nIn your conversation with your CEO, I'd focus on presenting it by saying something along the lines of \"I prepared her to do the work by doing X, she failed to do the work. I gave her feedback on how she did X, but she isn't listening to it.\" For example:\n\n* Donna is struggling with (quality of her work, timeliness of her work, total work output, etc)\n* I've provided training by doing X. She failed to learn the tasks.\n* I've answered her questions and coached her on her performance issues. She's failed to receive feedback and failed to perform even after given feedback.\n* She has an attitude that's demoralizing to my team. She's done X, Y, and Z. I've coached her on this. She has failed to receive the feedback.\n\nYou can present this as if you're soliciting feedback (\"I've tried all this, but I'm not reaching her... how would you handle it?\"), or just be frank. Feel out your CEO.\n\nThe truth is, you can do everything right and you can still either have to live with the situation or get fired. I would look for another job, because making a hire like this speaks to the quality of your company, and your fate is really out of your hands now.",
            "A lot of these answers are in the cultural vein of larger companies.  In small companies it's very different.  PM me if you want, I work on problems like these professionally for startups.\n\nHere are some important things to know about the situation:\n\n1)  Hiring, managing, and *especially* handling poor performance is very, very hard and very, very counterintuitive.  It's 95% certain that the leadership and CEO at your company are kind of inexperienced and shitty at it. \n\nWhy?  Because in a company of that size, they didn't get to those positions by being professional bosses / execs / recruiting / HR folk.  They got there because they're totally normally people good at the job in the industry (or good at starting a company, or whatever), who incidentally now have to take on this extremely difficult, unintuitive, and devastatingly socially awkward task.\n\nThe CEO might be intimidating with respect to the work, but with respect to handling Donna, think of him as someone just like you, with more power.\n\n2)  So this means a number of things:\n\na - Gavin probably also doesn't know what he's doing.  Changes are high that he knows the issue with Donna and is actually mortified, and is defending her because what else is he supposed to do?  I mean, imagine that you referred in a close person who you genuinely thought would be good, and they drive everyone else up the wall.  And there's ONLY 11 people there, so you know everybody else is secretly blaming you all the time.  How would you feel?\n\nb - Donna, in fact, is probably also mortified.\n\nc - The CEO thinks this is incredibly awkward because they've built up the business successfully based on trust and strong relationships, and now they have to tell this close bro that his wife is not cutting it.  They *really want* the solution to be easy.  Enough that some people will bury their heads in the sand or look for a scapegoat.  Others will figure out how to walk that boundary.  Depends on CEO's emotional intelligence, mostly, and experience with managing poor performance and making hard choices.\n\nd - All this adds up to:  Your problem is pretty much everyone else's problem too.  It's just that nobody knows what to do.  The fact that the work environment that's emerged isn't \"fair\" to you is actually kind of like the third tier of priority on the scale of the problem that Donna is intrinsically.  \n\n5)  So this is both good and bad.  It's good because you *actually do have a right and ability* to come out with your *real* issue and talk about it directly.  It's bad because the indirect ways it's affecting you don't really matter.  (Life in a small company is just never going to be fair-- there's too much unexpected shit like this flying around with too little infrastructure.  Instead, like volleyball, each team member just needs to handle the shit that flies toward them on behalf of the team.)\n\n6)  Senior leadership typically has a lot less direct power than people think.  Everything they do is systemically balanced against buy-in and established routines in the company.  Don't assume the CEO is not snapping is fingers because he has made the choice not to-- he may well be talking to you precisely to gain the context to maneuver himself into a position where he can make the move that you want down the line.\n\n...\n\nSo, what do you do about it?\n\n1)  Give peace a chance.  Start by assuming the best intentions from everyone, and that all 12 of you as a team really will fix this.  You know the saying \"it's not you vs me, it's you and me vs the problem\"?  This is exactly how small teams like this work.  Come at the situation from an attitude of it's you, CEO, maybe Gavin, maybe even Donna, vs the problem that Donna is not as great a match for the team as the team originally thought.\n\n2)  But don't let your trust lead you to be backstabbed or blindsided!  Trust but verify.  Still document all issues and verify all claims / promises, people do shitty things they wouldn't ordinarily do when faced with extreme social awkwardness.\n\n3)  Related to 1, be the solution, not the problem.  **The single biggest mistake I see people in these situations make is that they allow their resentment and fear drive their actions before they are verifiably betrayed.**  As soon as you make the conversation about your issues instead of about the company's issues, now all the awkwardness has an enemy to work itself out on: you.  \n\n3b)  Be a source of sanity, clarity, and \"everything is okay\" to the CEO, rather than a source of stress.  If he experiences you as another source of issues to be solved, as mentioned before, your problems are so much smaller than the problem of Donna that he's going to both feel like he has to resolve Donna without you, and also avoid you until he's ready to handle you.  This is a permanent loss of status.\n\n4)  Framing is everything.  Frame the Donna issue by taking the guilt and awkwardness about it.  Come up with a way to present it that shows genuine support of both Gavin and Donna, because CEO can't afford to lose Gavin on this.  Give everyone an elegant, empathic, happy out.  Tone of voice really matters.\n\nSpecifically, be the person who puts welcome, acceptable, relieved-to-say-out-loud words to the nagging discomfort the CEO is feeling.  (While representing your side of this, of course, still don't overstep your role.)\n\n---\n\nA script example:\n\n\"So, honestly, the past few months have been challenging.  Donna is {positive descriptors}, but she also comes from a different skill set.  I see her career in this space as being more optimized toward {different reasonable career direction for her that's true, like \"customer-facing relationships\" or \"systems-based rather than project based work\"} than {tactful description of what you do that Donna is shit at}.\"\n\n\"I've worked with her a lot to {way of saying 'teach her stuff' that is tactful but clear because it uses specific examples of how basic it is, such as \"show her slides, show her the X system\"}.  In that time, it takes 1/3 to 1/2 my time to collaborate with her.\n\n\n\"{More detail on how your work is affected from a company-first perspective, like \"I don't have enough time to output more than 10 widgets a day\".}\n\n\"Donna is concerned about {reframing of criticisms she's leveled at you that makes it sound like you're the adult putting her criticisms into the context of her own development, that also resonates with what's likely to annoy the CEO, such as \"how thorough our documentation is\"}, which is what makes me think that she's more culturally adapted to {something that you're culturally not that you know the CEO will stand behind, like \"a big company\" or \"a lower-risk environment\"}.  \n\nShe's also expressed to me a lot of times how much all this is stressing her out.  Do you think she might be happier / more successful if we tried to {whatever you think you can get away with, anything from \"partner her on Gavin's projects instead\" to \"find a role at competitor\"}\"\n\n--\n\nShort version:  Your script should\n- describe your experience in terms of what's good for the company\n- frame Donna's poor fit with respect to the parts where you collaborate in terms that the CEO resonates with\n- Be fundamentally benevolent toward Donna and Gavin",
            "Been there, done that, word of advice: Don't forget - YOU are the outsider here.  No matter how tactful you are regarding Donna, CEO will use YOU as the excuse to be rid of her, passing the buck on the responsibly so YTA.  What's that? Oh, *he'd never do that to youuuuu?*  He's the guy who hired her without checking her skills - and then pawned her off on YOU.  C'mon man.\n\nDon't say ANYTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT DONNA!  Make the meeting about your own lack of training ability - 'that's why we're always in one on one meetings'  CLEARLY I SUCK AS A TRAINER, maybe have somebody else take on the responsibility - like her husband.   \n\nBest way to CYA is to pretend Donna AND Gavin are in the meeting with you & CEO and not say anything.  Let them have the rope to hang themselves, time will out her.",
            "It's hard to know the state of mind of the CEO. From what you wrote it can go either way. If I were asked point blank about your co worker then I know my boss likely wants to affirm the direction they are leaning (firing her) and I wouldn't want to stand out from the people who made him think this way for the sake of the co worker, and it will look this way to the CEO if they have taken feedback about how bad she is and there you are, alone with her husband, in defending her.\n\nI'd be honest, and deliver it in the same way the meeting is going.\n\nIndirect Q - how is project x? Anything holding you back?\nA - the project is taking longer than usual as I am still helping new hire get acquainted.\n\nIndirect follow up Q - how do you feel she is coming along?\nA - It's great finding myself in a role to help develope others but as I am a new trainer I don't really know how long things should take on average? How do you think it has been going?\n\nDirect Q- What do you think about new hire?\nA - Co worker's wife? She is nice. How do you think she's acclimating to the role?\n\nYou want to nudge your CEO that you're aware of the complexity and politics of the questions. That you see other consequences down the road he wants you to go on.\n\nYour CEO is going to answer your question that everything is awesome. So slip in you're glad that all of the time you spend \"training\" her hasn't impacted their expected time or quality of your projects.\n\nOr that there are rumors, or problems, something negative... This is where you keep talking about time. Would the CEO like more of your time dedicated to her? Would they like you to dedicate more time to your projects? Is there a nominal amount of time for meetings? Time time time. How can you stop being productive and spend more time on this pet project? Don't say that, but this is the point you're trying to make.\n\nIf there is no problem in the CEO's eyes but others aren't getting along say you get the sense that interactions between her are a bit strained, but that's other employee's wife so there's an extra dynamic there. There are work clicks or inner circles sometimes, but this is a full blown marriage. I mean, they have legally privileged conversations with each other.  Make this part, and all parts of my reply, your own. Talk how you talk, you understand what's going on here better than anyone who read a few paragraphs. Mostly people gather the sense you want to be honest and move past this. Some people have experiences where this situation played out poorly. I am having you perform a subtle behavioral interviewing and trying to limit your words so you speak less.\n\nGood luck OP!",
            "i would take on the mentorship role as though it's your job.  set up meetings and some sort of structure to work with her and explain what you've been doing on projects she's now on.  if you keep it positive, then it's going to be hard to blame you for her failure.\n\nthen be honest but tactful with the CEO.  maybe ask that the mentorship be a shared duty, if it's going to make you miss deadlines.  having multiple perspectives really helps people learn anyway.\n\n>She's quite negative, complaining loudly that no one at the company has their shit together and I feel like she probably says the same things about me to her husband and the CEO outside the office.\n\nthe CEO notices this, rest assured.  don't complain, but be clear about this when you talk to the CEO.  \"she seems to speak very negatively of others in the office, and i don't know how i could best address it.\"",
            "I wouldn't say anything negative about Donna to the CEO, and I would give evasive answers to any prying questions. As far as Donna taking up all of your time, tell her that you need to concentrate on your own job, and she needs to concentrate on hers. Don't let her waste your time or interrupt you in meetings; when she does interrupt a meeting, just tell her that you are in a meeting and you don't want to be disturbed. You need to set some boundaries with her.\n\nI'd definitely keep my resume polished and my eye out for other jobs.",
            "This is a best case scenario for a work situation rife with nepotism! 100% chance he wants to talk about her, possibly other dynamics of the situation. This is your opportunity to plant the seed for him to do what needs to be done without actually saying it. Just answer honestly, whatever is asked of you and don't expand outside of what is asked. She is already on the way down, can't imagine CEO is a dumb guy and would let such an unqualified person stay. \n\nI think there is an even better opportunity here: You have proven to hold more value, you obviously understand the politics and respect and preform for the interest of the company. You deserve a raise after this bullshit and a significant one at that. She just made you look like even more of a rockstar by merely existing as a failure in the office. Take what's yours my friend.",
            "> However, the CEO booked a 1:1 with me next week and if he asks me about Donna I'm not sure what I'll say\n\nSay that you like her as a person (even if that's a lie) and that she's really trying to learn, and you are trying to teach her.  But she's lacking confidence and things that she does know she often needs reassurance that she's doing correctly.  Also she sometimes speaks negatively about others, even though she's still new and just learning herself. \n\nAs a result of that she's taking up a lot of your time and while you defiantly appreciate someone coming on to help with your workload, she's not yet at the stage where she's adding value.  Rather she's taking more time than she's saving.  Say that you think there might be potential in her but she lacks some of the basic skills you'd like to see in a new hire.  Make explicated mention of the fact that you're giving her the benefit of the doubt because she's Gavin's wife. \n\nSee what he responds with.  He may say that he's seen the same things.  If so, inquire if he has advice about training her?  How to build her confidence so she feels more comfortable doing things on her own without interrupting you during meetings. I might go so far as asking the CEO to see if he can get any insights from Gavin on this problem without it coming out that the criticisms were coming from you. \n\nIf he asks what your feelings are about her future, this is your chance to bring up the company culture and your feelings as an outsider.  Just say something simply like, I love working here but everyone already knows one another.  Honestly, that's part of what I love but sometimes I still feel like a bit of an outsider trying to break into a club.  Where she's Gavin's wife and his (the CEOs) friend you don't really feel super comfortable expressing an opinion on that.  Plus she's still new and deserves an opportunity to learn before being judged.\n\nAt the end of the day she has what's known in business school as informal power.  So you kind of have to treat her as both your superior and subordinate.  So it's not your call to hire or fire her, so just don't concern yourself with that.  If you are doing some training with her, ask about how to do that better.  Talk about the areas where you feel like she is falling short in a way that sounds like you asking how to fix them.\n\n> so I think my best strategy here is to wait this out and try to stay calm\n\nSort of.  You don't want to be inactive because there's the possibility that she's causing others to blame you for her failings.  Being critical of others is a key sign that she's likely critical of you.  Don't shy away from telling the CEO that you've noticed problems X, Y and Z but do try to frame it in a way where you're asking for his guidance rather than throwing her under the buss. \n\nBasically you are attempting to show the CEO that you do see failings in her, but that you are doing your best to get her up to speed.  If he wants to let her go, and anger Gavin, it won't be because of you. \n\nIf he does end up letting her go.  I might mention something in passing to Gavin, say how sad you were to see her go and how you tried really hard to bring her up to speed.",
            "I would pre plan meetings with her, say every Monday and Wednesday  for an hour each. have an agenda for the meeting to discuss actual work you are both doing together and leave wiggle room for her to vent.

            "To CEO \"Due to the personal situation, I feel uncomfortable giving a personal review. I hope you understand and respect the situation I have been put in.\"  \nIf she's bad, the CEO will notice and have the remedy the bad situation he's unfortunately put himself in. Refusal to comment is a comment on it's own. You wouldn't pause to say shes great if it was true. She complains alot maybe she doesn't enjoy it thier and isn't cut out for the \"unorganized\" enviroment. It's his problem though to sort that out.",
            "Step 1 - start applying for jobs elsewhere.  You're in a lose-lose-lose situation here and you need to cover your ass when you either get fired for her incompetence, get fired because they have to choose between you and her, or decide to just absorb the bullshit and realize you can't take it anymore.",
            "1. Donna sounds scared that she can't meet expectations which can heavily impact someone's performance.\n\n2. You don't know the whole situation and you don't see all of the work she does.\n\n3. She's panicking at you because she trusts you. In some ways, you might need to take off the training wheels and stop totally bailing her out. Instead of just showing her how to do something, guide her in the right direction and let her figure out how to do it from there. When you train someone something, have them do it and talk them through the steps, and then ask them to show you how they remember to do it by doing it again. Then follow up later and ask them again how they do it, because never assume they learned the first time. This is essential in training.\n\nYou are right, wait it out, don't get involved, don't get too personal, and focus on your own work. If you aren't her manager, it's mostly none of your business. Get your work done, help her in the mostly hands-off method I described, and she'll either sink or swim.",

            "Either find a new job or document everything.  The meeting times, the topics, the work, everything.  The key here is not to put it in a burn book, but in considerate, detailed, direct emails with the wife.  \n\nIf the CEO and you have a conversation about her or any slip in performance or deadlines or priorities let him know roughly hope much time you're spending on her and offer to send him the follow up emails or cc him going forward.\n\nAlso be prepared to talk about overall priorities that will slip now that you're spending so much time on this new project.\n\nDOCUMENT ALL THE THINGS.\n\nReally though, find a new job.  If he's bringing her in he's unlikely to want bad news and his judgement is questionable anyways.",
            "If CEO in a such a small company has not caught on the issues you have mentioned, either the impact is not there, or it is being overlooked. In both cases, establishing boundaries, mentioning it to the manager, or having a \"frank\" discussion may resolve the issue; however, there are also serious consequences to consider if it does not. \n\nFinding a new job would be a great way to resolve it - you deserve better than this!!! But it may not be an option. If this is not an option, than risking the blowback from taking corrective actions is not justified in my view.",
            "if i was in this situation i would let her know i understand the work can be complex and hence would arrange a meeting time with her every afternoon for 30 min to go over what task she has and discuss a plan \n\nu arrange the meeting time to suit u\n\nif she comes to u out of that time slot.. acknowledge her enquire and tell her u will talk about it in yr meeting \n\natm she is controlling u, change it up so u control the situation",
            "Definitely bring it up to the CEO in a 1:1 since you are in a small company.\n\nA quick question of \"How do you feel Donna is doing getting acclimated?\"\n\n\"I'm trying to help her get up to speed, but it's been a bit challenging and somewhat time consuming.  Is there more I should be doing without letting it affect my performance?:\n\n\"Has Donna spoken to you about how things are going. The other day I heard her and she seemed frustrated which is unusual for employees here\".\n\nQuestions like that will show whether it has hit your CEO's radar or not, and in a small company it should have by now.  He should be able to give you direction on whether you just need to wait it out or if you need to help more. If it's not a good fit, these issues tend to get resolved by themselves or by management.\n\nIf fingers coming pointing at you, then you may need to look at exiting the company if the company culture has turned against you.",
            "Be completely honest in your 1 on 1 with him. Let him know that you aren't Donna's trainer, and that Donna needs to pull her weight, and that every little thing she brings to you makes you question her ability to be a productive employee. It's begun to effect your work because you spend so much time digging her out. Stick to her work, say nothing of the nepotism hire or how you feel about Donna as a person.",
