        "selftext": "So, my father has been absent for most of my life. He left my family when I was 6, so I have very few memories of him. He once called me when I was 12 and told me that he didn\u2019t want to be apart of my life, ever. I made a promise to be better than he ever was.\n\nFast forward to now, I have a college degree, I\u2019m a personal trainer, I professionally model, live in a nice apartment, have a great relationship with my friends & family and generally live a really good life. I\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for 2 years now. He\u2019s always been aware of my dads absence in my life and has respected that until now. Apparently my father saw an ad for the gym I work at with my phone number on the ad. I am the model in the ad and he instantly recognized me. He left a voicemail on my phone asking for a session, but I have purposefully avoided it. My boyfriend decided to call my dad back and spoke about my life. I told my boyfriend never to do this again and respect that I don\u2019t want my father in my life.\n\nMy boyfriend told me it was gonna be date night at our favorite restaurant. Turns out he invited my father. I was livid. My father was saying how proud he is of me, but I don\u2019t want to hear it. He ignored my existence for most of my life, so I definitely don\u2019t want to see him now. I left the restaurant crying and upset.\n\nMy boyfriend is upset with me for not giving my father a chance. He had good intentions but he should\u2019ve respected me when I told him I don\u2019t want to see my father.\n\n**TLDR- My father has been absent from my life since I was 6. My dad found my number on a personal training ad and left a voicemail. My boyfriend invited him to dinner with us (without my permission) and it was a disaster. I left crying. My boyfriend is mad that I didn\u2019t give my dad a chance, but I\u2019m upset my boyfriend disrespected me when he invited my dad, knowing that I don\u2019t have a good relationship with him. Any advice?**",

            "If he wasn't upset with you, I'd say chalk it up to some idiotic ideas about family being the most important thing and some notion he had of doing you a favor. That's stupid, but not necessarily deplorable.\n\nHowever, the fact that he thinks you've got anything to apologize for is pretty disturbing. Your expectation should be that he profusely apologizes both for the initial act and for being upset with you after the fact. And if you don't get that response from him easily, it's time to reassess your life with him.",

            "As I was reading, I was thinking to myself the boyfriend is trying to play the hero and the fixer and while he made a mistake, maybe it's not so bad. Then I got the part where he's mad at you for not giving your father a chance. \n\nIt might be one thing if he completely admitted he was wrong and apologized. It's another to get mad at you. He certainly doesn't respect your wishes or boundaries. ",
            "My father left me and my mom when I turned 8, and without any birthday or Christmas cards or anything, he then had the gall to contact me through fucking Facebook messenger once I turned 18, acting like nothing happened. We talked for a bit, but once I got busy with uni I pretty much dropped contact with the outside world. After 1 month of not talking to him, he had the guts to ask \"if this is how you treat your father?\". Dropped him like a fucking anvil over the Mariana trench. Now, every time I have a girlfriend, he's tried to sway them with sob stories to try to let him into my life, and they've always asked me my version of the story, bless their souls.\n\nWhat your boyfriend did was wrong; he went behind your back, undermined your trust, and he took your choice away from you, all because he wanted to be the hero and whatnot. Your feelings are completely valid and you *should* be angry as fuck towards your boyfriend.\n\nAs for advice, I would suggest telling your boyfriend your story about your father and your feelings from when he left you and told you those horrible things, and make sure that you tell you boyfriend that this is not the time for him to give input. He might not understand your choices because he's not experienced the same things as we have, but he sure as fuck can respect your feelings and autonomy in this situation. If he cannot, then it might be time to move on.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this, but we *do* get to choose our families and that choice is yours entirely.",
            " > he had good intentions\n\nNo, he didn\u2019t. His intent was to disregard your wishes and feelings and there\u2019s a big streak of seeming to know better than you to what you need and want. \n\nKeep your eye out; that sort of attitude doesn\u2019t generally only pop up once. ",
            "Your boyfriend badly violated your boundaries. It doesn't matter what his \"intentions\" are. He had no business going behind your back to do something you didn't want. And if he even thinks connecting you with your dad is a good thing, he's clearly not listening to you or respecting you. You can't have a relationship with someone who does this to you. ",
            "Your boyfriend overstepped your boundaries in so many ways that I personally would think long and hard if that was a dealbreaker. He does not get to dictate if you have contact with your father or not.\n\n\nThat he doesn't show any understanding after you left so upset is alarming. He is a selfish, manipulative person.\n\n\nPlease find someone who understands narcissistic parents and respects your wishes no matter what.\n\n\nEdited typos\n\n\n",

Why in the name of god does he think HE knows better than you about your relationships with your parents? this isn't even about your dad, really, it's about your boyfriend going behind your back and deciding that he knows better than you about what's best for you. I'm so sorry OP.",
            "> My boyfriend is upset with me for not giving my father a chance.  \n\nI see two problems here:\n\n1. Your boyfriend does not respect boundaries\n2. Your boyfriend does not understand that \"giving chances\" are not his call to make\n\nIntentions mean nothing to anyone except the person with the intent. I think you should ignore any other kind of debate that arises concerning how to deal with family members, and make it clear to him that point 1 and 2 are NOT debatable, and if he thinks otherwise - that's your decision whether or not you want to continue a relationship with that.",
            "That was not your BF\u2019s choice to make at all. And he has no right to be mad at you for the way you reacted.\n\nMy parents split when I was 2. My dad paid no child support and made the effort to see me once during my childhood. My mom took me to see him once more another time when we were in the town where he lives. At 17, I got curious to know him more. It didn\u2019t turn out well and I gave up at 18, which was 25 years ago now.\n\nI\u2019d be furious if anyone did to me what your BF did.",
            "If my BF did this to me with my bio dad I'd leave him without hesitation. He knew what your relationship was with your dad and why, it was in no way his place to force anything there, let alone ambush you. He isn't on your side, he's on his own. He wanted to be the \"fixer\" who saved your relationship with your dad, he wants that more than he wants to understand & respect you. The fact that he's mad at you about this shows that he's more concerned with you \"ruining\" his fixing then he is about the realities of your history with your dad, your comfort levels and your boundaries.\n\nThis is not a guy who's on your side or who has your back.",
            "You're about the fourth person to post on relationships about an SO instigating contact with an abusive relative of the OP.  In two of the cases the OP ended the relationship.  It's never appropriate to re subject someone to their abuser.\n\nAs others have pointed out it is a matter of disrespect.  Your boyfriend doesn't respect your boundaries, decisions and your safety.  Now he's angry at you because his arrogant plan backfired.  This is breakup worthy.\n\nIn one of the posts I've mentioned the OP cancelled her wedding, but was willing to attend couples counseling with him.  But in her case her SO realized how badly he hurt her, apologized, and was begging for forgiveness.  He wasn't berating her.",
            "I'm assuming that you want marriage and children, because those are pretty popular life goals for many people.  \n\nImagine you have a child with your boyfriend, now husband.  Imagine one day, you go to the gym to train a few clients, then maybe pick up some groceries on the way home.  You come home to your boyfriend and child.  You ask how their day was.  \n\nThe kid tells you all about the quality time she spent that day with grandpa.  Grandpa being your father.  \n\nYour boyfriend has disrespected your wish to not contact your father and he ambushed you with meeting him.  Let me lay this decision tree out for you.\n\nStep 1: he chatted about you with your dad, knowing you didn't have a great relationship.  Ok, not the end of the world.  You asked him to not do that again.\n\nStep 2: Somehow, your boyfriend and your father are in contact again.  Instead of ceasing contact, your boyfriend and your father decide to \"surprise\" you with a meeting.  \n\nStep 3:  At any point between now and the dinner, you boyfriend could have done two things:  he could have cancelled the dinner or he could have informed you your father would be there.  He did not.  \n\nStep 4:  Now, instead of being repentant at what a truly bad idea that was, he is angry at you for not fulfilling his fantasy of being the hero who reunites a family.  \n\nYour boyfriend isn't treating you like a person who is capable of making your own decisions, based on your own experiences.  To be quite honest, I'd be evaluating if I wanted to continue any sort of long term relationship with him at this point.  He is invalidating your experiences and your emotions regarding your father by dictating how you should respond to his reunification attempts.  \n\nWhat's next?  He decides that maybe a surprise Christmas get together will do the trick for reuniting you?",
            "If your bf were apologetic and actually understood or tried to understand why he was wrong, I would\u2019ve said to maybe try to work things out. But he\u2019s upset with YOU for being upset?? That\u2019s a huge nope from me. ",
            "That's too bad, after 2 years he doesn't respect you enough to abide by your wishes. I think this is incompatibility, some people just can't fathom why others would want to cut people[relatives] out of their life. Your BF tore open an emotional wound, what's he doing to try and repair it?\n\nLike others said his intentions weren't good, not for you. Maybe in his head he was trying to mend a relationship but as you see that's not what he did and if he really \"got\" you he would've known better.",
            "Yikes. \n\nNot only does your boyfriend not understand your feelings about your father (forgiveable), he *aggressively ignores them*. He doesn\u2019t WANT to understand, because he assumes he knows better. \n\nTerrible foundation for a relationship. The fact that he\u2019s not grovelling for forgiveness is just the nail in the coffin. He\u2019s not sorry and he will do it again.",
            "There are two aspects here that really worry me.\n\n\nFirstly, your boyfriend had a paternalistic view of your relationship I.e. The little lady does not know what she needs and I the big man will sort the problems out.\n\nSecondly, there is a worrying aspect of over control here. Even though you state that you don't want want something to happen he goes against your wishes to do this exact thing.\n\nFrankly, from what little info we have these values appear to be in direct contrast to yours and sadly, I don't think that this relationship will return it to be healthy for you.\n\nHe also sounds incredibly self centred and inexperienced.\n\nGood luck, please post updates and congratulations on what you have achieved so far!!!!!\n",
            "For some reason, some people from normal upbringings find it impossible to understand that bad parents exist. My MIL is an abusive narcissist, and I've lost count of the times people have told my husband that he needs to patch things up with her. \n\nIt's crap, and ultimately it shows a huge lack of empathy on the part of the person insisting on reconciliation.

            "You boyfriend *needs to learn to fucking respect you.* Holy shit, show him this thread.\n\n> My boyfriend is upset with me for not giving my father a chance.\n\nHe should be profusely apologizing. He does not get to force family reunions on you. \n\nHe is still upset with you after all of this? Let's break down how much warning he had not to pull the surprise dinner stunt:\n\n- He knew about your dad's absence in your life. Depending on what this means, maybe it's not too blameworthy that he would want to help you two reunite\u2014this depends on how much he knew. If you had expressed explicitly that you do not want to interact with him ever, and you had told him about how your father told you *at 12 years old* that he did not want to be a part of your life ever, then he fucked up pretty bad on this alone.\n\n- If he knew you were avoiding the phone call voicemail, he should *not* have intervened. This is especially true depending on how well-informed he was about this situation.\n\n- He called your dad *and spoke about your life*. Undoubtedly a pretty huge fuck-up here. If he was not completely filled in, it's debatably a worse fuck-up. We have seen posts here where the family member has been excluded because they are abusive or had kept OP trapped in a cult for years, etc. The more ignorant he was, the more stupid this might have been. And of course it's still terrible if he was fully informed.\n\n- You told him never to do this again and respect that you don't want your father in your life. Full stop, him not respecting this is breakup-worthy.\n\nAnd now he's still upset with you instead of apologetic. You can find a better boyfriend. He fucked up multiple times here. Talking to your father was a huge fuck-up. Had he apologized profusely there and ended it after you put him on notice 100% clearly, then I think that would have been fine. But instead he decided to ambush you. *And* he's upset with you instead of apologetic at this point? Ridiculous.",
            "I know this sub likes to scream \u2018break up!\u2019, but honestly? This shows an extremely lack of respect for you and your feelings on your boyfriends part. The phone call would be something that would be very upsetting but in the end seems like something you both could talk through and get over, especially after you made it extremely clear that you didn\u2019t want your father in your life and that you didn\u2019t want him to ever do that again. \n\nBut to then go behind your back and ambush you into having to meet up with your father? And then getting mad at you, as if you\u2019re the one who needs to apologize in this situation is entirely fucked up. I know it\u2019s not entirely the same but if my husband invited my abusive mother back into our lives or attempted to get me to speak to her, let alone force me into a room with her I\u2019d drop him on his ass so fast it\u2019s not even funny. I honestly would have a hard time trusting him after this, he ignored everything you said and then acted as if you didn\u2019t have a right to be upset about what he did, even though you had every reason to be furious, he betrayed your trust in a huge way, multiple times, even after being warned, and I\u2019d assume while knowing what your father had done in your past.

It\u2019s also about the emotional impact of seeing him. \n\nIt could potentially destroy all of my hard work in 10+ years of therapy, and the life I\u2019ve built for myself. It took me 5 years to be able to see a man that looked like him and not want to throw up or hide. \n\nYour feelings towards your father and your reaction might not have been that extreme but the fact is someone who is supposed to be a safe person is a liar and more concerned with what he wants vs what you want and your decision. \n\nDump him and run.

But being in a similar situation with my dad - if my boyfriend did what yours did, there would be no coming back from that. I\u2019d never speak a single word to him again. He majorly overstepped a boundary you set in your life, made that decision for you, spoke for you, and now HE is upset? For me that would be unforgivable.

In his mind, you would never have to say that to your father and mean it, because he didn't have the experience of a father that abandoned you.

Like, does he do things, knowing that they will upset you, and in spite of them upsetting you?\n\nIf he's reasonably sensitive, then how is his relationship with his father? Like, if his experience with his dad is largely neutral to positive, then it's pretty common for people (your BF included) to assume the same of you and your dad. Like, even though you've told him what your dad did and how you feel about it, his own mental model of his relationship with his dad sort of overrides those facts. It can be really, really hard for some people to understand completely. Even people who are generally sensitive and empathetic. Now, that doesn't excuse that he did something directly against your wishes, but at least in this situation there's some hope that he can come to understand why this was a horrible idea and not repeat it in the future. Advice for getting there is sticking to your guns about your BF being wrong about doing this, explain to him that his expectation that you would be okay with this or that you're bad for not \"giving your dad a chance\" is so wrong that you don't even know where to begin, and insist that you, and only you, will decide how to handle your father in the future.",

My husband had both his parents in his life who worked hard to make sure his childhood was happy and carefree.\n\nAlthough my husband understood my reasons for never wanting to reach out to my sperm donor, he will never fully understand why.

That's it. I don't know him, don't want to know him, and if he ever came into my life I'd walk the other way.\n\nYou have every right to be angry at your boyfriend. Were he some guy you were only dating for a few months I would chalk it up to naivete, but he has been with you for two damn years! This is flat out disrespectful and he didn't just cross the boundary, he pole vaulted over it.\n\nLife is not some cheesy Hallmark made-for-tv movie, or some Disney cartoon where everyone ends up happy and all loose ends are tied, and not everyone you share DNA with is meant to be in your life.",

Most comments here are assuming the worst about your boyfriend\u2019s character, but I would advise to really sit him down and explain that your life is infinitely better without your father, and that people like that honestly don\u2019t deserve to see their children. \n\nAlso it\u2019s worth mentioning that your father might be doing this because he wants something from you. Even if he isn\u2019t, and is genuinely wanting to see you, people like that usually don\u2019t change.

Did your dad think your bf had told you he would be there? \n\nThe fact that your bf is now mad at you for not giving your father a chance is ridiculous. You need to make it clear to him that what he did was unacceptable and that your relationship (or lack there of) with your \u2018father\u2019 is none of his business. Blood and biology don\u2019t make a parent, love and being there do.

I know a lot of folks on here are dragging your boyfriend, and rightly so: he went over your head to do something that ultimately disempowered you and doesn\u2019t seem to understand why that\u2019s a big no-no. However, I do think it\u2019s important to consider his family background, and what their dynamic is, bc this might seem to him perfectly acceptable. My husband had no earthly idea how dysfunctional and toxic my family was for the first couple of years and he always advised me to do what he would do in a similar situation with his family when I would ask for help. It was only he witnessed the outcomes of \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d or \u201cbeing the bigger person\u201d and how much harm it caused me, that he began to understand. Your bf\u2019s anger might just be embarrassment that he hurt you and he\u2019s being an asshole about it. \n\nSo my advice is: stick to your guns, do not feel pressured to have a relationship with your dad. Talk to your boyfriend about this extensively and try to demonstrate. And if he doesn\u2019t respond or try to see where you\u2019re coming from, can him. You deserve someone who doesn\u2019t force you to engage with people who aren\u2019t good for your mental health. Good vibes and good luck!",
            "One rule I always make for myself when in a relationship is that the goings-on in my boyfriend\u2019s family is none of my business, unless that business directly affects me as well. \n\nYour boyfriend had no business trying to intervene in how you interact with your father. My guess is that he was probably fooled into thinking \u201che\u2019s not such a bad guy,\u201d after talking with him on the phone. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d probably leave immediately, as that is a pretty disrespectful thing to do. However, talk to him about it first, remind him why you dont want your dad in your life in the first place and tell him to stop meddling. If he refuses to understand or he does something like it again, I suggest you break up and move on.",

            "This resonates with me so much. Similar circumstances except my mother decided to invite my father to graduation night and it took everything I had to not lose my shit. Anyway just wanted to say that you are justified to feel hurt about this and congratulations on moving forward and bettering yourself rather than living in the past and victimising yourself ",
            "A lot of little red flags leading up to a massive betrayal of your wishes, your trust, and your emotional safety - and then he got mad at you for how you felt about it. As others have said, the other things *might* be forgivable if he was remorseful and learned from the experience to be more respectful of your boundaries. But in this case, he repeatedly ignored and disrespected your feelings and then turns it around to make you the bad guy. \n\nThat's abuse territory. End it. ",
            "If someone did this to me *and then demanded I apologized* I would dump him. That shows a total lack of respect both of you personally and of your agency over your own life. He doesn't need to \"save you\" from your own choices, which were made with much better context than he will ever have. \n\nI'm so sorry you had to go through this horrible ordeal. You owe both your father and your boyfriend nothing. I hope you're able to heal, and find men in your life who will respect you and treat you better. ",
            "His upset? WTF!  He stuck his nose where he has no business, getting involved in your literal business (calling a business contact) and showed zero respect for your feelings on the matter (that he was well aware of). This should be a deal-breaker. I'd break up with him, anyway. ",

            "I would lose my absolute mindgrapes if my partner called either of my extremely estranged parental units and \"surprised\" me with this kind of donkey nonsense.  I'm not recommending a break up since it sounds like he was trying to do a good (from his perspective), even though his response is detestable and he clearly lives in some kind of Disney world where reconciliation is the norm.  People who haven't had their parents abandon them just don't understand the kind of pain and problems this causes and how hard it is to get to a place where your abandonment issues don't manifest on the daily.

He never tried to contact, nor provided child support. When I was 18 (surprise surprise) he sent me a Facebook message saying how awful my mom is, I never responded cause I was livid that this stranger dares accusing my mom for raising me. Later, he found my boss's number and called him and left his number. I will never EVER call him. I do not want any contact with this, pardon me for the language, selfish asshole.

He needs to realize that this incident could reflect what he does in the future and damages the trust you had for him. What if you don\u2019t want your child to be in football because of head injuries etc- is he going to disregard how you feel and sign the kid up anyway and take him to practice secretly?\n\nIf he had done only the phone thing and learned I would give him a shot and you did! But now that he has done it twice he needs to earn your trust back and thats going to be very hard considering he escalated from the phone to a secret face to face meeting with your biological father. Thats the top of the roller coaster imo. Its the ultimate betrayal for me.\n\nIf my SO of 6 years did this to me I would consider separation unless he could get my trust back.",
            ">I told my boyfriend never to do this again and respect that I don\u2019t want my father in my life.\n\nHe did it again. Time to have a sit down, calm talk about what you find acceptable in a partner and what you don't. You find it acceptable that he wants what's best for you and to make you happy. You don't accept that he thinks he knows better than you and that he made the choice to completely disregard how you felt, disrespect your choice about who you want in your life, and did it all behind your back in ambush form. \"If you cannot respect that I am perfectly capable of deciding who I want in my life, than perhaps you are someone I should be removing from my life.\" Any contact I may ever have with my father will be on my terms and my terms only. His response better be him apologizing and accepting he's the one at fault here.",

If he agrees and honours it, good, you've overcome a challenge in your relationship and grown stronger together.

            "My grandmother did this to me with my own father when I was 18 or 19 and heading to college. He treated me much the same as your father did you. The event had about the same effect as yours had. Since I am older now with children of my own, my perspective has changed a little.  \n\nWhile your boyfriend didn\u2019t respect your opinion, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s breakup worthy. Many can\u2019t understand how painful something like that is and, for all intents and purposes his heart was in the right place. It\u2019s obviously worth a discussion but I wouldn\u2019t end your relationship with him over this. \n\nWhile I didn\u2019t speak to my Father for much of my life, I did speak to him before he died. My uncle called and told me that he had a terminal disease and only had a month or so to live. I\u2019d always struggled with the \u201cif\u201d I would let him in my life again but could never get to the point of allowing it. \n\nI was on the beach when I got the call. My children were playing in the water. And it suddenly occurred to me that while he wronged me, he really hurt himself more. He missed out on my life and more importantly, my children\u2019s lives. He\u2019d never be able to see them play and splash in the water or buy them fun toys or enjoy family holidays or do all the other things grandparents get to do. \n\nHis own selfishness resulted in a greater loss to him than I. I married and had two beautiful children, a successful career, by others measure I have lead a \u201csuccessful\u201d life. He was the one now dying alone. \n\nI flew across the country to see him in a hospice. He never apologized. I am sure he regretted his life choices but he wasn\u2019t going to say that to me. But I told him I forgave him anyway and that he was the one that missed out. I didn\u2019t do that for me, but I did it for my son whom I want to have a relationship with and I didn\u2019t want this anchor emotionally hanging around my neck. \n\nIt was sad. He died the next day. I am glad I did it because you never know if you\u2019ll regret something like that. \n\nI say ALL that to encourage you that your life and future relationships - boyfriend included - will be richer if you are able to forgive both of them and move forward. That doesn\u2019t mean forgetting what your father did or re-establishing a relationship with him. Holding that anger against him or your boyfriend however will only hurt you.\n",

Its very crappy what he did and he should have respected your wishes but try to u sweat and maybe why he did it. He probably thinks you would be happier without that tension between you and your father dragging you down. I would just be very clear with him and say something along the lines of \"if you ever contact my father behind my back again it will be a deal breaker\" so he u understands just how much you won't budge on the issue. Your boyfriend was most definitely in the wrong here, super wrong, but try to ha e a little u.freestanding and see if you can clear it up.with him that it better not ever happen again before breaking up.with him over it. My mother is the same way and if my.boyfriend did this I would also be mad but I wouldn't break up with him because my mom isn't worth it and I love him.

He was raised different and has different views. Personally, I can understand where you are coming from and you are right and I see where he is coming from and he is right. Yes your dad made a mistake but people do make mistakes and then regret it later, though if he has said these bad things to you in the past I agree that you should be hurt but maybe your dad is hurt also from what he did to you.  \n\nI think he was coming from a good place and I think you should be upset but not at him, just tell him to never do that again or you will lose trust in him and if he cares for you he will respect that. \n\nI don't like seeing people here saying leave him/her , blah blah blah.

There is no doubt he hurt you but instead of chosing the all to easy path here sit down with him and explain your emotions and how you feel about your father and how you felt about the situation without using the word \"you\" just talk about your feelings. \n\nPeople make mistakes, we are just human and to throw in the towel at the first mistake, even if it's big would doom any possible longlasting relationship.

            "Why on earth is everyone saying \"break up with him\"?\n\nHe made a mistake. If he wanted you to possibly talk to your dad and get some sort of closure on the whole situation, he should have convinced you to meet with the man instead of ambushing you. That was definitely wrong.\n\nI think his heart was in the right place, but he definitely should have known that you'd be upset at the idea of getting ambushed. I think you should have a calm discussion with your boyfriend about how you don't want to confront your father because you don't need to. Your boyfriend would say \"Maybe you should confront your father and vent some of these emotions that you feel towards him instead of bottling it all up\", and then you say \"Maybe one day I will confront my father, but I'm certainly not ready to do that now, and ambushing me was definitely a stupid idea, you should have known just how upset that would make me\", and he'll say \"I'm absolutely sorry that didn't respect your wishes, but every time I try to talk to you about your father, you just shut me down.

I thanked her for telling me about my husband and the student, and also for being such a good friend. \n\nI asked her about my husband. She said there\u2019s nothing unusual. He\u2019s been a bit withdrawn and aloof with everyone lately but that\u2019s about it. \n\nYesterday I went over to my house unannounced. He was there alone in his office. I told him I wanted to talk. He said he\u2019ll explain everything. \n\nSo apparently this woman has had a crush on him since two years; her friends \u2018ship\u2019 her with him. She would stare at him during her rotations and would blush whenever he looked or talked to her. Back then, he didn\u2019t think much of it. Many girls have had crushes on him and he always ignored it. \n\nAbout 1.5 years back, they were in the same research group thing (I don\u2019t know how this works but there were 5-6 people along with these two). Because of this, they had to spend some time together working, and it was then that he started noticing her. He went into detail about how he was impressed with her intelligence blah blah blah and her beauty blah blah blah. The moment he realised that he had a crush on her, he dropped out of the research thing. This was a year ago. \n\nFew weeks later, she gave him the letter confessing that she has feelings for him. The first thing he told her after reading it was \u2018you can get into trouble because of this\u2019. She didn\u2019t care. She wanted an answer. \u2018Is it all in my head\u2019 she had asked, to which he replied with \u2018it\u2019s not just in your head, but nothing can come out of it. I hope you understand.\u2019 \n\nThat was the last time they interacted. According to him, the \u2018yearning looks\u2019 Sarah described were more of \u2018awkward eye contacts\u2019 than anything else. He told me that even though he is *still attracted* to her, he has no intention of pursuing any sort of relationship with her regardless whether we stay together or not. He said he\u2019s willing to change his job and go to therapy. I told him to give me sometime to think about it. \n\nTo sum up; \n1. This has been going on since three years. Not once did he mention anything to me. \n2. The student and him spent a considerable amount of time last year working on the research. \n3. He told her he liked her back lol. \n4. He\u2019s still very much attracted to her \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019ve decided to go ahead with a divorce. I don\u2019t think I can trust this man again. And a relationship without trust isn\u2019t something I am interested in. I\u2019ve told my parents about it. They\u2019re not exactly on board but they\u2019re still supportive. I\u2019ve also contacted my lawyer about the same. It\u2019s gonna be a long process, I believe. \n\nThat\u2019s it. I believe this is my last update.  \n\nTL; DR ; he\u2019s still attracted to her; I won\u2019t ever trust him again. We\u2019re getting a divorce. \n\n\n\n",

            "What stands out to me is he could have nipped this in the bud, since nothing could happen then when she asked if it was all in her head, he could\u2019ve said yes and he has no interest then acted completely professionally instead of sending mixed messages. If it would bother him to lie to her well, he has been lying to you by omission for years by not mentioning this. He let this carry on and now you know, suddenly he can change his job and get therapy, but it seems like too little too late. I would also have trouble letting this go. Since again, the longing has been going on for years! Even if it wasn\u2019t acted on, the feelings were indulged more than they should have been, and he\u2019s only thinking of solutions to the problem now he has to rather than being proactive. I understand why this is an issue for you.",

            "The thing that makes me say this is unacceptable was the reaction when you told him. If he really wasn\u2019t trying to implode his marriage for that girl, when his wife asked about it, that should\u2019ve been his wake up call. Instead, he took the opportunity to introduce the idea of this woman as a love interest. What man would do that to a woman he really wants to stay with? I feel like he took that chance to start the process of making wife leave. I think he is doing all the right things to \u2018stay innocent\u2019 but he\u2019s hoping the wife just divorces so he can be with this girl. 3 year is a very long time to have a crush. The fact that he never tried to remove himself before now, speaks volumes. He would\u2019ve told you about the letter if he was loyal. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong. I think most people don\u2019t know what loyalty looks like.",
            "Lmao these dumbass comments \u201cyou too hasty its a cruuuuush chill\u201d\n\nLike stfu the man literally said \u201cI CANT GET HER OUT OF MY HEAD\u201d\n\nIf he was commited to his wife he would have changed job PROACTIVELY not wait until now\n\nHe let it develop to a point he cant take his mind off of her and yall saying its no big deal, you guys obviously never had a real relationship",

            "So the student tried to break up a marriage and he didn't get mad at her over it, didn't threaten to report, didn't ask her to transfer/didn't transfer himself. For all the people saying \"it's just a crush\" it's really weird to me how they see a \"harmless\" crush going on for years where both parties know they like each other. This is a recipe for disaster. Like the girl wouldn't swoop in if your marriage had a crisis. This is why you tell your partner if things go too far - the letter was too far, his \"i can't stop thinking about her\" was too far. If he cheated everyone would be telling you he is an idiot because he let the situation go long enough to lead to it and it's his fault and not an accident. Years-long crushes don't just evaporate on their own.\u00a0",

            "So he never ask you to come back to him until you came to talk to him ?",
            "It\u2019s hard now but you\u2019ll thank yourself",
            "Obviously, you shouldn't stay married to him if you don't want to, but don't divorce just because reddit tells you to do it.\n\nPersonally, I think it's pretty normal to develop crushes even when being married. It's what you do, or don't do about it that matters. I also haven't told my husband when I had a crush on someone else. \n\nIt would be irrelevant to our relationship because I had absolutely no intention to act on it. The intensity of our love has gone through ups and downs. Such is the nature of life-long relationships, but I know I'll stay loyal, because no matter where we've been or what we've gone through, I love him and I don't want anyone else. \n\nAs such, telling my husband would *only* serve to hurt him. There's literally no other purpose. And why the fuck would I want to do that? I love him. If he asks, I won't lie to him, but I'm not going to go out of my way to tell him something that'll hurt him when it has no real consequences. \n\nIt's been about 10 years since that crush came and went. It's barely a blip on the radar. Our marriage is going amazingly these days.",
            "Idk, the way I see it, he addressed it to the best of his ability. He told her no and that they could never be. He dropped out of the research as soon as it became a boundary crossing, and he adjusted his contact with her. \n\nWhen you asked the questions, he answered honestly, even if it was something you didn\u2019t want to hear. I don\u2019t fault people for being attracted to someone, it\u2019s what they do with those thoughts and feelings. \n\nNot saying you shouldn\u2019t leave, do you. But I just feel that keeping it from you isn\u2019t as much of a violation as you\u2019re taking it because he did make plenty attempts to reduce contact and adjust his behavior. Quitting a job over someone crossing boundaries? Especially when he's invested years and alot of money in medical school? That's asking a lot. \n\nthere are some positives here. but ultimately do what you feel is best.",
            "Do what's best for you, OP. Though, I'll give him credit for, at least, passing the low bar and acting like a mature adult by keeping things professional with the student, he still looked you in the eye once confronted and said he felt a spark with her he no longer felt for you. That's the kind of confession you can't take back, once the words have left your mouth.\n\nWishing you the best of luck in keeping the split amicable and smooth. Hope you find happiness in whatever form that takes.\n\nEdit: I get it, people, he didn't act professional *enough* not to be an inappropriate idiot, still. You can stop replying to that bit. I meant that he rejected her, and that was the professional thing to do, at the time. Not that he handled it 100% flawlessly. Excuse me for not bringing the pitchfork and torch to a comment mostly made to wish the OP well on her divorce journey. \u0ca0_\u0ca0",
            "OP I think your husband chose not to tell you about the love letter because he\u2019s flattered by her attention and it\u2019s an ego boost. I totally agree with you that admitting to reciprocating her feelings and keeping it secret for the past few years is a dealbreaker. What was the point in him telling her they can never have a relationship if he was just going to turn around and admit to having feelings for her? It\u2019s like he wanted to give her a glimmer of hope. Have you actually seen the letter? When she gave him the letter did she know he was married with a child?",
            "Man, so are you saying this stuff happens irl and not just in Grey's? Like how is it possible that this girl gets that many classes with one teacher for that long?",
            "Editing this to add that his actual first mistake was not lying to the girl and confirming her feelings. He didn\u2019t owe her the truth. He should have protected himself, his wife, and his marriage. \n\nHis second mistake was not lying to you when you told him what your friend Sarah said. The teary eyed confession is just insulting.  \n\nHis third mistake was being apathetic to you leaving him. Never talking about it and waiting until you came to him. He should have been on bended knee from jump asking to go to counseling right then to save your marriage and everyday after that until you relented. \n\nHis fourth mistake was being so honest with you about his feelings being mutual for his student. He should have lied or kept that shit to himself until the grave. He should have gotten his own counseling 3 years ago. He should have changed his job immediately. \n\nHis fifth mistake was thinking this wasn\u2019t a big deal or that you wouldn\u2019t be legitimately hurt by this. Because again 3 years is a long time to sit there pining away for another woman and not go to counseling. \n\nEven with all of this I still think there is a chance you can save your marriage but honestly if you don\u2019t want to, I understand that too. Because even though he\u2019s told you that it will never be this girl, he cannot give you the assurance that it won\u2019t be someone else down the road. You do know that at the moment, it\u2019s definitely not you. His actions speak to that clearly. He\u2019s only physically faithful because he probably believes emotional cheating is not a real thing.",
            "Cheaters might hide a lot of what has gone down. You decide whether he seems remorseful and he doesn't sound great, from his own words, \"if that makes you stay\" since he doesn't care about your feelings. Believe it if he's been showing you who he is. \n\nMinimizing what went down is another common way to deflect guilt. \n\nIt's very hard to start a relationship from a point of mistrust, and more often fails. So I understand your decision. \n\nFrom everything I would say divorce too. You can divorce for any reason, but this is indeed the highest concern possible apart from physical violence.",
            "OP, you are clearly hurt, but to divorce over this without trying couple\u2019s counseling is doing your kid a disservice. To fault your husband for not proactively changing his job in academic medicine is an indicator that you\u2019re looking for justifications for divorce. But it\u2019s not like he works in tech or sales and could easily find a fungible job. \n\nImagine explaining this situation to your daughter when she\u2019s an adult, and ask yourself how you think she will react. Your husband could have been more candid with you, sure, but he did the right thing overall and you\u2019re blowing up your family without putting any effort into working through it. Most of the people cheering you here are probably in their 20s or younger with no children.",
            "The fact that you had to reach out to him speaks volumes. I'm glad you dumped him. Even if it wasn't physical they definitely emotionally cheated. \n\nIn my last post I mentioned that she wasn't scared of repercussions of the love letter due to knowing OPs husband wouldn't get her in trouble (because they were flirting). I was right. Men shouldn't be making other women who aren't their wife that comfortable",
            "Divorcing your husband for navigating a challenging situation with this much dignity and honesty is wild. And the songs of praise here are unhinged. Absolute terrible attitudes about marriage all around.",
            "Talk about an overreaction.  So she confessed she had feelings, he shut it down (oh no, he said he finds her attractive too, the horror).  He then removed himself from the group and they haven't interacted in ages.  Then some busybody uses romance novel words to play into your insecurities, and you go nuclear.  \n\nYikes.\n\nI know this is filled with \"yas queen\" comments, but this is borderline insane behavior.  Good luck finding a man of that quality again.",
            "Is he willing to fight for you? Or is he waiting for you to leave so that he can be with her? \nAsk him that.\n\nThis all is very hurtful, but as long as nothing has happened, the marriage and relationship can be saved.\n\nHe had to leave the job immediately, open phone policy and couples therapy. \n\nAre you two willing to put the work in it?\nOr is the trust and love completely gone?",
            "GIRLIE please do not file for divorce because people on this site told you to. I think we\u2019re leaping sooooo many bounds here. He hasn\u2019t cheated on you and he was honest with you. I think you two need to deal with this in therapy, and stay off this site.",
            "So I said this on the original post, but your update made it so much clearer. \n\nYour husband found himself in a situation that many married people do. Instead of acting on it, he removed himself from the situation completely. He treated the other woman with respect and dignity but made it clear that nothing would happen. Then when you asked he was completely forthcoming about everything. \n\nYour husband is a decent man and you are a fool. Hopefully, once you're out of the picture, he can figure out what's best for him.",

            "The fact you think you should get divorced over this is why people should never get advice from this subreddit.",
            "This is bullshit. People don't control their crushes and attraction. If you think you'll find love with someone who would never ever look at other girl like that then you are delusional. He didn't cheat on you. And changing career over a crush? More bullshit. I'm not changing my job because of a pretty girl that's into me. INSANE.",
            "It's amazing how Reddit can change people's lives in an instant",
            "I know I will be downvoted for this unpopular opinion.\n\nI haven't read you previous post so I may be missing out on some information, but shit happens, we're human... We can get attracted to people, our brain chemicals can mess with us. The thing that matters most is what we do about it.\n\nHe got sucked into it, but he didn't actively pursue it and even terminated the thing before it got further.  From the limited information in this post, it seems like He did not get involved with her, he did not flirt with her or started developing relations over texts or calls. So apparently, there is no emotional or physical cheating.\n\nMost importantly, he is willing to switch jobs and go to therapy to save the marriage with you. \n\nI think this is a forgivable mistake. Yes he should've been open about it. Yes should've acted on terminating it sooner. But yet he did it just in time before things went out of hand.\n\nAgain, i might me missing out on information here, but from.what I gathered... Your marriage is salvageble if you both work on saving it.\n\nBut by the end of the day, it's depends if you can find forgiveness within you and are able to move forward with him. \n\nWhatever you decide, keep your friend out of this decision. From what I've witnessed with several relationships, friends can often mess things up big time  if gotten too involved. You are your own individual person. Do what's right for you without your friend projecting their choices and influencing your decisions.\n\nEdit: I read your previous post. I'm a lot more sure about what I said above now. Plus I think you have self-esteem issues because you think you look average whereas your husband is handsome and should be with someone more beautiful. Your self esteem issues might be playing a significant role in infleucing your decision. \n\nYou have a daughter together. Please think this through and give your marriage a chance. The novel like story that your friend has projected onto you and now you see the situation from that novelish lens might end up in a decision that you later regret.\n\nHope you make a wise decision.",

He had one child (my father) with his wife and about 10 children with other women. \n\nSome women had two kids others had one but he had many. \n\nMy father used to pick up this little girl on her way to school everyday and one day he asked her why do miss the bus everyday and she said why would I take the bus when my brother is driving by. That\u2019s how he found out she was his sister. \n\nMy parents are from a small mountainous island so the locals often stop to give strangers rides because although things are a short distance walking up and down mountains makes getting places hard work. \n\nMy father told my mother how much resentment he had for his father, that everything that was for him and his mother went to other women and their children specifically his longtime mistress and her two children. \n\nThen he turned around and treated my mother the same. He never had any other kids but he never spent money on anyone other than himself. He was extremely selfish. Cheating on my mother when she was pregnant and when she kicked him out abandoning his child. \n\nAlthough, I haven\u2019t been cheated on I still carry a lot of betrayal trauma from how my father neglected me as a child. \n\nI don\u2019t blame my mother for kicking him out.

He knew this was wrong for 3 years, and I think because of his involvement in it he didn\u2019t want to tell you because he knew deep down it was inappropriate and wrong. I believe he didn\u2019t tell you because he enjoyed this little secret he had, and maybe didn\u2019t want to have an open conversation about it.  I haven\u2019t seen you mention once of him apologizing for betraying your trust, I\u2019ve only seen him try to justify his actions. \n4. On one hand is natural for humans to develop little crushes. But this is one that went on for too long, they were spending alot of time together, and went too far. 3 years of a crush is a LONG time. Starting to develop a deeper crush because you are interested in how their mind works is on another level\u2026looks are just surface level.  I personally believe divorce is the right action.  He could have told you sooner so you two could work on it together and he could have set clear and stern boundaries with her (maybe actually get her in trouble for the letter).",

I just thought that with all the help and kindness I received, why not update?\n\nI\u2019m still with Emily. I went forward with the idea that Emily and her son are a package deal in mind, and it\u2019s been kind of a weird process since. We get along really well, and I\u2019ve found that I\u2019m lucky to have this kid in my life. He\u2019s funny, mature, intelligent, witty. But at the same time, he\u2019s *not* my kid and he never will be and that\u2019s something hard to navigate. It\u2019s hard even to describe the feeling- of loving this kid and feeling like a dad, but never being one and feeling like you can\u2019t be one. But I try. It\u2019s a lot of blood, sweat and tears (Emily can testify to the tears), but it\u2019s so worth it. A few weeks after I found out about him, Emily told me her son was getting picked on because he didn\u2019t have a dad to do a father son activity at school with. I decided to go, sort of just to scope out how that sort of thing felt. The look on his face got rid of every question I\u2019ve had, every doubt or regret.\n\nEmily and I are in counseling. We found out shortly after I posted that Emily is pregnant- and we\u2019re twice blessed in that it\u2019s twin girls. There were a lot of emotions, and we both knew that it was a weird situation and we haven\u2019t been dating that long. So, we went to see a counselor. Sometimes Emily\u2019s son joins us, but it\u2019s mostly us, learning how to be our best for her son and our daughters, and each other. We\u2019ve been definitely testing each other some days, and this pregnancy has put a strain on every relationship we have. Her son moved in, and they\u2019re stepping on each other\u2019s toes. I moved in, and we\u2019re all learning our new boundaries and new bonds.\n\nIt\u2019s hard. There\u2019s a lot of stupid mistakes I regret making now, that I\u2019ll regret more in 5 years. If I had s time machine and my current knowledge, I might\u2019ve been more careful during sex. I might\u2019ve put distance where I didn\u2019t. But for right now, I\u2019m happy to be with my girlfriend and her son, waiting for our little Amelia and Lorelei. This is teaching me how to be a good dad, a good partner, and a good human. I\u2019m learning coping skills for so many things in life, and I\u2019m just learning how to be okay. This is a situation a lot of people would shake their heads at and say \u201cpoor guy\u201d, but I\u2019m really blessed. I\u2019m really thankful.\n\nThanks for helping me out, everyone.\n\nTL;DR: Emily and I are still together, raising her son and expecting twins ourselves. ",

            "Take it from someone currently holding her newborn daughter, having a baby, not to mention twins, can be really stressful and trying on even the best relationships. I don\u2019t want to discourage you, but rather remind you that when your precious little girls arrive you can get through the lack of sleep and stress by knowing it\u2019s just a phase and things get better.

            "Take the time now to build as strong a relationship as you can with the son. Be his friend and let his mother worry about being the parent. Once your daughters are born, 99% of your focus is going to be on them. When I met my now ex-wife, she had a seven year old son. Once she got pregnant with our daughter, she told me all of this. That if I wanted to have a good and meaningful relationship with my stepson, that that was the time to make it happen. I didn't listen to her. Once my daughter was born, the automatic bond you make with your newborn child is something that is almost undescribable. Of course my stepson took a back seat to his new sister. My poor relationship with my stepson was a significant factor in my marriage ending. It was only after the fact that I truly understood what my now ex-wife was trying to get me to understand. I still have a relationship with my stepson (infact he even works with me), but it's not nearly as good a relationship as he deserved. This is one of my life's greatest regrets. Don't make the same mistake I made. Use this time wisely. Build something meaningful and significant now while you are able to. All the best to you.",

I am worried that the bulk of your last post isn't yet addressed. \n\nIt's great that you like him, and that he seems to be warming to you. But one moment of warmth is not enough to counter the difficult times up ahead as he goes into the troubling teenage years. What happens if he decides that he wants to treat you as a father, and you are not willing to go all in for him? What happens when you have to discipline him for bad behavior or criticize him? Are you going to hold onto the notion that he is not your son and that you are not responsible for him? Is there going to be a permanent distinction in the way you treat your twin daughters and the 13 year old? \n\nI don't blame you for these feelings, but I think it's worthwhile thinking about them. Being a step parent is a hard task, and needs more thought. You \"just happened\" to become a father AND a stepfather at the same time. \n\nIt could turn out great, but keep thinking about what's best for the family. Take especial care of the boy, he's in a vulnerable position, and you are just starting out with learning how to take care of kids. You seem to have a level head. I wish you all the best.

Her son just met a random dude, now you\u2019re his dad after 6months?? And he has 2 sisters now from this random dude. Update us on this kids mental state in a few years. He is a teenager and his mom sounds extremely irresponsible to allow all of this\n\nYou went from having a chill life to having 3 kids and Emily being in your life til she dies ",

            "I really, really hope that pregnancy wasn\u2019t intentional. But considering she waited until she knew you were in love with her to acknowledge she even had a child, it doesn\u2019t seem far fetched that she would trap you in the situation if she thought you were going to leave.\n\nHer son should have been her focus until after he moved in and got settled, not a serious relationship. That poor boy is going through a lot right now.",
            "My \"step\" dad has been in my life since I was 6 months old. I never knew my bio dad. I didn't even know my stepdad wasn't my bio dad until I was nine.\n\nHis family treated me as their own. I had a happy childhood and was loved.\n\nI still had severe issues with abandonment and the fear that if my parents had a biological child, I would be pushed aside. I had therapy for it but that little voice in my head still whispers that I got lucky my parents never had more children.\n\nAnd I have never known anything but my dad. He has never ever given me an indication that I'm anything but his daughter. \n\nYou don't have that relationship with her son. That's perfectly normal considering. The timing on this is a freaking mess. They don't even have a stable relationship and that should be her priority. Building a stable home for her thirteen year old son.\n\nInstead, you're about to welcome twins into your life with someone you've known 8 months. \n\nI'm not thinking poor guy. I'm thinking poor thirteen year old who has already been given up (with good reason) by his bio mom. \n\nFrankly, your happiness isn't the priority. The wellbeing of your future daughters and her son need to be. He should be in his own form of therapy if he isn't already. \n\nAnd you need to learn how not to favor your bio children over your future stepson. Which is going to be next to impossible since they will be babies and he will be a teenager. ",

            "Something I noticed when you've written this is that you make a clear distinctions when you say \"her son\" and \"our daughters\", I know that you are still dealing with the sense of being a dad to him but wouldn't subtle distinctions like this make things harder. If your serious about staying with her why not think of him as your son. ",
            "My mother remarried when I was 15. It took some time to get used to, but after a while of getting to know him my step dad turned out to be pretty great; I thought of him as a second father. Just be there for him and try to get interested in the things he likes. One major thing is to listen to his issues, and get engaged with any conversations you have with him. Being a young teenager and having an adult listen to and respect will massively increase the feeling of affection  towards you. ",

I'm actually a mom with a 6 year old daughter and it's been so hard trying to get my boyfriend to accept that my daughter needs him to be more of a father figure. (she wouldn't know her dad from a stranger in the crowd, he abandoned her completely) is it pride that holds him back from helping me raise another man's kid? What can I do? Any advice from anyone or personal stories would really help me please. Also we have an 8 month old together, she was definitely a big surprise for us and obviously a big reason why I want to keep our family together. He's not mean to her or anything like that, but they act like they're just acquaintances, he doesn't really let her warm up to him and he doesn't really put effort into getting closer to her either.

But now we are a family with another baby coming ina couple months!! \n\nLife happens, it\u2019s hard for blended families but I appreciate my husband for stepping up to a role that wasn\u2019t necessarily his, but now is and they both are great together. ",
            "My SO was raised by his step dad and it meant a lot to him that he chose to be in his life. SO was young when he first came around and they had the typical \"rebellious son\" \"strict dad\" relationship. Neither would be the men they are today without the other, and now SO is grown they have a wonderful relationship. \n\nSo I guess I'm saying thank you for choosing to be in her son's life. ",
            "Looking back to when I met the man I call dad almost 24 years ago it was a lot of awkwardness and a lot of learning one another. It took time to solidify the relationship. Yeah it\u2019s weird because he\u2019s not your flesh and blood but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t treat him as such. \nI can\u2019t recall when into my parents marriage I started to call him dad but it filled a void I had for the first 8 years of my life. I wouldn\u2019t change a thing if I had the opportunity to have grown up with my bio dad in the picture. \nThe best thing you can do is to continue to build a bond with him. When he feels it is right if that day comes it will just feel natural to hear him say \u201cdad\u201d. My dad adopted me and I took his last name maybe a year after they got married. Not saying it\u2019s a step you need or have to take but know it\u2019s an option. \nContinue to be positive, learn the boundaries, learn one another and most importantly don\u2019t throw in the towel with the kid this is all new to him too. It takes time, have fun and enjoy it most of all! \n",
            "2 of my 4 kids are not bio. I adopted my stepson from my 1st marriage and my current wife has a son also.\n\nScrew anyone who says they are not mine, I am their dad and will be til death.\n\nDNA means nothing. ",
            "My dad isn't my dad but he's the best dad I could have ever asked for. I feel like in the beginning he wasn't sure but over time and after my sisters he just became a full time father. ",
            "I have two older brothers. Both are step fathers. My oldest met his step son when the boy was 8. He's going to be 12 in a couple months. My second brother met his step son when the boy was 13. My father is my two other brother's step father and he met them when they were 4 and 6.\n\nI'm sure a lot of people have said that blood doesn't make a family. Just be there for your family and take each day one at a time. Good luck! ",
            "As a child with a horrible example of a father, and an amazing example of a stepfather who passed away a few years ago, it was my stepfather who I considered to be my real parent. In fact, it was my stepfather who was going to walk me down the aisle. Just because you aren't blood related does not mean you'll never be a father in his eyes. Also, may I also recommend r/predaddit for any pregnancy questions and experiences you have. I saw someone else also mentioned parents of multiples. You are about to be outnumbered by children, so take on the mindset that it's gonna be a bit hectic for a few years, laugh at everything, and I wish you the best of luck!",

I had a lot of thoughts if I really wanted to be with her before we got into a relationship. her little one was absolutely cute and I regretted nothing. I wasn't a dad or something like that for her but I took over so many responsibilities for her and she accepted me. that was for sure the best experience I could make. ",

            "Being a step parent of two, it's always been extremely hard accepting that they're not 'mine'. It's only made more difficult when I love them as my own. Though it may be one of the hardest things I've done, long-term, it's extremely rewarding.  My youngest had failed 1st grade when I came into the picture, but now she's going to third grade and has made so much progress! And my boy who is now 13, I've had to teach him that not all women are evil. He trusts me enough now that he asks me for advice on various things instead of just being glued to his dad. I love them both so much, and they've even told me that it'd be cool to have another sibling since I've never been down that road yet. Stick with it man, it's an amazing and rewarding feeling!",

We all wish we did things better. What only matters now is our next steps. \n\nAs for the boy, he is your son. Stop trying to think differently. Just because he isn't blood doesn't make him a stepson. A stepson is still a son.  All those kids that were adopted by complete strangers, what would make them? You are starting to realize you love him, keep growing that love. It will reach a point where you would give your life for him like your daughters. Be strong, show him what a real man does when faced in an odd situation. He will grow up and see you as the superhero you have become to him. \n\nThe majority of children are mistakes. We weren't planned. Most of our parents were not ready and effectively winged it in terms of parenting. It will be hard, there will be tears and fights, but there will also be love. You will have 2 beautiful daughters to watch grow. And they will have a loving mother, father and big brother to look up to. All the best luck towards your future steps.",

        "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year. He is an incredible person, and many of my friends tell me that he\u2019s a great catch. He was very into me, and did much of the chasing in the early days of our relationship. About 3 months after we started dating, he said \u201cI love you\u201d. I said it back. I was genuinely in love with him. This is the first time in my life I felt this kind of love.\n\nHe has an ex-girlfriend [25F] who he dated for 4 years before they broke up 3 years ago because of their busy schedules. He dated another girl for 1.5 years afterwards, and then me. He and his first ex are still friends, according to him they are just close friends now.\n\nThey are busy and dont live in the same city so he almost never sees her. Once, the 3 of us plus her new BF went for dinner together. She was nice to me, very beautiful woman, charming, smart. The kind to turn every head in the room.\n\nI always had this terrible suspicion that maybe my BF still had feelings for her, but he always reassured me when I voiced my concerns to him. We can talk to each other about anything and I appreciate that.\n\nLast week, he said his ex and his boyfriend were in town again and they invited us to brunch. I thought nothing of it and went. At the brunch, his ex mentioned that she and her BF were engaged. This really threw off my BF. His mood just suddenly changed. After the brunch, I noticed him taking her aside and whispering something.\n\nThe whole week, my BF seemed to be in a bad mood.  Yesterday morning, I found my BF drinking  shots at the kitchen counter. He looked as if he hadn\u2019t slept all night. I asked him what was wrong. He shrugged. I asked him if itnwas about his ex, because he had been off ever since he saw her.\n\nHe said yes. He told me that he hasn\u2019t been able to stop thinking about her and the smile on her face when she showed off her new ring. \u201cIts funny because I always thought that she\u2019d be wearing my ring.\u201d I was stunned. He continued. \u201cDont you have a man who you thought was \u201cthe one who got away?\u201d\n\nHe asked if he could be honest with me. He told me that he still loved her. That he had always loved her. But he said at the end something about fate and how he had to move on and that he had to focus on us right now. That his ex was a thing of the past. Still, I was fucking devastated. I appreciated his honesty and understand he was drunk, but wow, it fucking hurt.\n\nIm crying in my room and i dont know what to do. I feel like my heart has just been stomped on. My fears have been validated. My bf is only with me because he can\u2019t have his ex. Where do I even go from here.\n\nTL;DR: BF confessed he has always been in love with his ex and still loves her.",

            "\"I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us\" - Phyllis, The Office\n\nThat's legit what my first thought was upon reading this. You deserve someone who instills in you the faith that they would pick you over anyone else.\n\nLong Overdue Edit: Thank you so much for the gold and upvotes! Never beg to be loved. ",
            "I am so sorry that you are going through this...\n\n>\u201cIts funny because I always thought that she\u2019d be wearing my ring.\u201d I was stunned. He continued. \u201cDont you have a man who you thought was \u201cthe one who got away?\u201d\n\nThis says to me that he didn't really see his life with anyone, but her. So everyone else he dates is just holding her spot.\n\nYou need to let him know that you can't be in a relationship where you're the second choice. He needs to deal with the relationship with his ex without hurting you in the process. You need to be someone's first and only choice in a relationship. \n\nThe big problem is he's not done with his ex, obviously he has feelings that he hasn't resolved. Unfortunately nothing you could've done would've changed how he feels. He needs to go work this out on his own, without hurting you in the process.",
            "Hey. I am so sorry. That must be so hard to hear. \n\nA few thoughts:\n\n-If you were my friend, I would tell you to break up with him. This does feel like something that is hard to get over. Even with a lot of reconciliation, you will always have that worry in the back of your head.\n\n-You DESERVE someone for whom you are their great love. You DON'T need to settle for someone who has a \"one that got away.\" NOT everyone has that (and don't let him make you think that!) Most people have exes, but many people do the hard mental and emotional work to get past them, which he has clearly not done. He is instead putting that on you.\n\n-Just because he is hung up on his ex, DOESN'T mean that he doesn't love you a lot, and that all those amazing feelings of love, and all those nice firsts, weren't real. I still think you should break up, but I don't think you should feel like you were lied to. As I said, he never did the hard work to get over his ex, so he is in a weird and confusing place. That doesn't mean your love was a lie.\n\nFrom a practical sense, give yourself lots of TLC. Spend some time apart from him, even if you're not sure what to do next. Lean on friends, even if it's vulnerable to tell them you feel rejected. \n\nSending you love and good vibes through the internet, I can only imagine how hurt you feel. You WILL feel better in the future, you WILL find someone who can love you without being hung up on an ex and you WILL find a way to be grateful for the ups and downs of this relationship in the future! It just doesn't feel like it now, but I truly believe that. ",
            "When I was 22, I also dated a 29 year old who pursued me, told me he loved me pretty quickly, and he was the first love of my life.\n\nAnd, he admitted to me several months in that he was still in love with his ex-wife who had left him for someone else, but he still cared for me, too.\n\nI was young, super in love, and thought maybe I just needed to give him time to work through it.  I told him so, including that I really wasn't happy to hear it and expected him to work on it, since he was in therapy. He did precisely squat to get over it, and we broke up several months later.\n\nSo take it from someone who is over a lifetime away from that love - this relationship is over.  It hurts, it's not fair to you, but this relationship is done.  You can just add yourself to his list of great women who got away, because once you move on and stop giving him love and support and comfort, he may get angry at first, but then, he's gonna try and win you back.\n\nHowever, the trust between you is pretty ~~will~~ well broken now, and there is no bringing it back.  Your BF needs to work through his shit, and stop looking for manic pixie dream girls.",
            "I\u2019ve been where your bf is at. He will never get over her and he will leave you the minute she takes him back. Time to move on. ",
            "Let him reminisce about his EX as a single man.",
            "That's a really tricky one. It seems to me, that there are some people who nurse an ex-love interest like some other people hold onto a grudge. The further away they are from the relationship, the more they idolise it. No one can ever compete because you are eventually competing with an idolised fantasy love that never really existed. \n\nI'd be concerned that your boyfriend is behaving like that. I would understand if he'd just found out about her engagement that he might feel a bit raw, but to be still upset about it to the point of getting blotto after a week seems like pretty deep seated unresolved issues. \n\nI think you need to take your time to see how you feel about this, but I know if it were me I'd find this very hard to recover from and would probably move on. ",
            "He's got issues,  he told you he is still in love with someone else. You deserve more in a relationship than to be second choice.\n\nIt is good to find out before you have shared offspring or assets.",
            "I am so SO sorry you're going through this... I can't even imagine how terrible this must feel. I strongly believe that continuing this relationship is only gonna hurt you. There is no action in the world that can forgive, and especially not make you forget this. Falling in love with or having a crush on someone else while in a relationship is one thing. But he has obviously known about his feelings for her during your entire relationship and clearly puts her above you, which is what I find absolutely heart-breaking.\n\nAlso, making you find out about it in this way is just beyond me. Did he think he could just tell you he literally loves another woman and is devastated about seeing her engaged with someone else and then be like \"but hey, I'll focus on us now\". I don't care if he's sad or drunk, you don't treat your partner like this! This is where you have to know your value and break up with him. And whatever you do, please don't stay in this relationship because you love him and want him to love you as much as her. Things like this don't change and I believe that if he truly loved you this woudln't happen. You deserve so much better and I wish I could tell you something less hurtful.\n\n&#x200B;",

You will find someone who will love you and only you.\n\nAgain, I am so sorry you're going through this, and if I could take all the pain away, I would.\n\nHuge hugs, and God bless you.",
            "What he told you essentially is no matter how much you invest in this relationship, you'll never have it reciprocated.

He's interfering with their relationship, which she will think is creepy, and this will start a war you have no place in. Get out before he involves you in this nonsense.\n\n> He and his first ex are still friends, according to him they are just close friends now.\n\nI hope you learned your lesson. It's naive to get involved in such a situation in the first place. I hope you never date anyone like this again.",
            "He needs therapy. End stop.\n\nHis ex obviously will never be with him again. His ex obviously was always just his friend after the break up, but your boyfriend never addressed his feelings about their break up, or his feelings about that ex, and now it may cost him this relationship. He was drunk, but alcohol doesn't create feelings. He was obviously undergoing some psychological distress, either romantic, or from having to finally let go of any sort of day dream fantasy he created of a future while with her.\n\nHe's harmed you, and there's no taking that back. Everything in these follow up moments are on him. If he comes back to you, tells you that he obviously needs therapy because his feelings are abnormal, and he doesn't want to lose you because he LOVES you, and will stop at nothing to do the work to cultivate a future together? Then maybe. But even that maybe is highly dependent on how your boyfriend is processing that conversation with you.\n\nYou have every right to your emotions, they're completely valid. He hurt you. He needs to address the problem he's brought, and that's only if you think this guy is deserving of you. And really? He may be a charmer, but he obviously lacks in any kind of emotional communication, from that night to every single time you asked about their friendship and he chose to not completely confide in you about the heart break, or what he was processing. His emotional tool box is missing so many pieces, like knowing he should have cut off all contact with the girl as soon as they broke up if he felt any kind of lingering codependency or romantic notions, or telling the girl he's been dating that he took that break up particularly rough, or how to compartmentalize his own emotions when he's feeling conflicting emotions. His obvious emotional codependency, and lack of emotional boundaries. Or really, so many micro decisions that would have NOT led him to losing the incredible girl he's been dating for a year who went on couple dates with his ex, and sounds like she was really as supportive and loving as she could be. It was unfair of him to not work on himself while bouncing through these relationships, and he's now hurt you.",
            "Where do you go from here? Right out the door. He told you in no uncertain terms that he is in love with someone else. You will never forget that. You deserve to be with someone who loves you and makes you feel like you come first. We all have a past and baggage that comes with, but this would be a bit too much for me to deal with. I works leave him.",
            "The good news is that you are 22 and did not waste a bunch of time on this dweeb. I suspect he wanted to date a younger woman so that he would be able to date you casually and drop you without much guilt if he had a chance with her again. Making sure he wouldn\u2019t have to settle down. ",
            "So... I was in almost your exact position several years ago when I was your age.  My ex had dated a girl at the end of high school and into college (3 years) and they split up when she cheated on him.  He told me at the time he had been considering proposing to her.  But things ended, he insisted they try to remain friends, they stayed in contact.  Between her and myself he dated another girl for about 6 months before they split up over distance.\n\n\nHe however still wasn't over her when we started dating.  He never admitted to still being in love with her, but he was.  He even told me he loved me at 3 months (just like your bf did).  Externally he seemed like a great catch, but I can tell you, it just never was going to work for us.  There were a number of other things that caused problems between us but he never was over her and that is a large part of the reason I left.\n\n\nI hope for your sake that you will not make the same mistake I did.  Your loving him will not make him love her any less and it is likely that he will always feel like this (unless he goes to therapy to see if that will help, my ex refused).  You could be the most fantastic girl in the world, but as long as you aren't her, it will probably never be enough.  Don't destroy yourself trying to make him happy (again, like I did), you deserve someone who will not always see you as a consolation prize.",
            "There is a difference between having feelings ABOUT someone in your past, and having feelings FOR someone in your past.\n\nI have feelings *about* every ex. A couple are still good friends - we were young and naive but have matured into a friendship. Some were amicable breakups but there was just no reason or desire to stay in touch - but I do think fondly of them and hope they're doing well. Some there's anger, regret, bitterness, confusion. Some there's \"what if\".\n\nBut I can say with absolute certainty that if ANY of those people called me up and wanted to give it another try..... nah. Unequivocally no. Nope. Uh uh. I may have fond memories of our relationship - but I don't want it back. I may have unresolved questior anger - but nothing productive will come from interacting with that person. I may wonder what if - but we're both different people now. \n\nI have feelings *about* the person or relationship. I do not have feelings *for them* and I don't want them in my life, or at least not in the same way. \n\nAnd that's *especially* true if they ended things. Obviously I wasn't the right partner or the right partner at the right time. VERY rarely getting back together can work, but it's so rare it's not a risk I would take. They wanted to move on so I accepted it and did the same. I doubt I even *could* feel the same way about them now, even if I wanted to.\n\nThe difference here is your BF is still in a relationship with his ex. It doesn't matter if she agrees. It doesn't matter if that would ever happen or not. His love and his emotional energy are being spent on HER. He probably does care about you but there will always be a disconnect. You'll always be compared to her, you'll always be second place. And you can't *make* him feel differently. You can only accept it or not. I suggest not.",
            "You need a guy who feels that way about YOU.",
            "The \"one that got away\" ideal isn't a good one, and not everyone has one. If he honestly still thought she'd one day wear his ring, then he's clearly viewed your relationship as temporary-- a relationship for as long as she won't take him back. Nevermind that she'll never offer to take him back, the fact that he would leave you if she did means this isn't a relationship where he is fully committed to you or fully respects you. And honestly he'll never move on if he's not willing to cut her out of his life completely. You know he remains good friends with her and keeps a level of contact and a platonic relationship with her so that if she ever wants to get back with him, she can, right? And, whether she ever intends to at on that or not, he has literally told her that he still loves her. What else could he be whispering? \n\nYou deserve someone who loves you most.

It\u2019s a great feeling, don\u2019t cheat yourself out of that wonderful experience by wasting time with a guy who thinks you\u2019re second best. I met the love of my life in my late 30\u2019s; I\u2019m not saying you\u2019ll necessarily wait that long, but I\u2019m saying that at 22 you\u2019re in the early days of dating, give yourself a chance to be somebody\u2019s #1. \n.\n- If you think this is bad, wait until the wedding happens.

Do you really want to watch him get choked up watching \u201cthe one who got away\u201d marry someone else? Even if he doesn\u2019t go to the wedding, he\u2019ll get upset all over again regardless and get mooney about her getting married.\n\n- I promise that even if you decide to get past this, it will taint everything if he ever decides to ask you to marry him. In the back of your mind you\u2019ll know he wanted someone else first. Do you want to ruin that moment for yourself? Him down on one knee and you simultaneously being happy and sad that he\u2019s asked you to be his wife but he\u2019d rather it was someone else? I hope for your sake that you wait for someone who is so excited to marry you that you\u2019ll feel nothing but joy when they ask. \n\nSorry if that sounds corny but I\u2019ve been 2nd choice and it\u2019s heartbreaking and it sucks. Getting to be someone\u2019s #1 can be a long and lonely road sometimes, but I promise it\u2019s awesome and feels great when it finally happens. Good luck OP. ",

You deserve not to be the runner-up.\n\nIf you stay in this relationship, you'll be struggling to overcome the ex in his affections. That combined with the age difference is going to give your bf too much power in the relationship.

He's deceived you, and I don't blame you if you can't trust him again. It's a bit like he had an emotional affair here, albeit a one-sided one that isn't reciprocated. \n\nThe way you get over someone is you cut contact with them, and you focus your time, energy and emotions on other things (and people). If he was willing to work on your relationship and you think you can get past this, you might be able to work it out. But there's a betrayal of your status here that you have to get over, if you think you can, and you think he can really put this behind him. \n\nThey say people's true feelings come out when they are drinking, but alcohol is also a depressant, so he might feel differently today. He may have never truly mourned the loss of that relationship and he might need to do that now. You guys definitely have some talking to do, maybe some couple's counseling. I'm not sure I'd toss away an otherwise great relationship if he's singing a different tune sober, but it would take a while to rebuild my trust. \n\n100% though, I'm out if he's not willing to cut contact with his ex.

He is impeding his own chances of feeling great love for anyone else by hoping that one day she will choose him. She has chosen and he needs to understand that his love for her should mean that he should be happy for her instead of thinking solely about himself and the fantasy that he\u2019s created in his head. \n\nYou have to decide if you\u2019re willing to work through this with him or step away and let him continue on on his own.

I know that isn't what you want to hear, but if you stay and try and \"fix\" this you're going to get even more terribly hurt. I know you may think you couldn't hurt any more than this, but you could.\n\nAs long as he's \"close friends\" with his ex, there  will never be anyone else in his life, not really. When she gets married, it will get SO much worse, he will become bitter and angry, and that will start spilling in to his behavior. He will start resenting whomever he's with for not being his ex. Unconsciously, he will start to be abusive as he projects his negative attachment to his ex on whomever he's with. Even the nicest, kindest people can be unintentionally abusive if they have pain and fear they don't take ownership of and deal with.\n\nTill he does that, he isn't fit to be in a relationship with anyone. He's dangerous to be with. And no matter how clearly anyone else see's this, until he's ready to admit to it and start working through his regret, grief and pain over his ex, he will never change. There is nothing you can do, no magic words, no way you can behave, that will help with any of that. So don't think that with enough love and compassion you can change him... you cannot.\n\nLove is not enough in situations like this.\n\nHe is simply NOT ready to be in a relationship with another person because he's not capable of being fully with anyone else. He needs grief therapy to get over her and \"uncouple\" emotionally. Till he's ready to fully let her go from his life, he shouldn't be dating.\n\nI am so sorry you're going through this, but I'm glad you found out now, before you're even deeper into the relationship and perhaps even married yourself. At least right now you can leave him and start healing yourself from the heartbreak with a minimum of trauma and drama. \n\nThe kindest thing you can do is make it clear to him that the reason you're leaving is because he shouldn't be with anyone right now, and that he needs therapy. Don't fall for promises and apologies and \"I'll change!\"... because he won't. Not right now. Don't be with someone for who they might become in future. If he DOES work his shit out, perhaps you two can reconnect in a year and see how things go, but do not be with him through his working on it time, you will end up being the punching bag and bad guy for everything he needs to work on that hurts for him.

In a sense he was still very much in love with her and she was in love with him. But there was a lot of pain between them and they were very toxic for each other. I had been friends with them their entire relationship and my husband and i didnt discover that we had feelings for each other until after they broke up. While we were dating they still tried to talk things out so that they could be friends. Apparently until she found out that we were dating she still thought that they would be together and I think it was the same for him.\n\nMy husband was so confused about his feelings for me that he unintentionally hurt me a lot in our first few months. He was in love with both her (well his idea of who he had built her up to be) and me. After 6 months of trying to help him get over her and to love himself again, I did the hardest thing I've ever done. I broke up with him. He needed that time to not be in a relationship and focus on himself. The next 5 months we were broken up were some of the hardest of my life, we stayed connected and whenever we saw each other it felt like a magnet was pulling us together. We eventually got back together and he proposed a year later and we got married a year and a half after that. He had his time to heal and it was just time that we needed to give our relationship. It was the right person just happened faster than he was anticipating.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that I think he needs time to heal, or maybe even time to persue her. If it's right, you won't be second best in the end. He should be over her and should love himself before he can fully love you.",

If, 10 years from now, you find out his ex is divorced, what\u2019s going to happen? ",
            "You need to break up. He will never move on. I was like him at one point. It's been 4 years since we broke up and I still think of her at times. We were that compatible. I have recovered, to a sufficient degree where I can move on with no lack of love for my next girl, but it has been proven scientifically that men never stop hurting from breakups, never recover completely. You need someone who loves you as much as he loves her. Even if he does come back apologizing, that will not change the truth that he will never stop remembering her.\n\nYour guy will come, as through your message I see you have a great personality.",
            "I've been in this situation...as the guy.\n\nLet him go, he is never going to stop loving his ex.\n\nIf you really love him and want him to be happy, let him go.",
            "It\u2019s going to hurt like hell, but you need to leave it behind. It\u2019s not worth it. \n\nI\u2019ve been there, my ex was never fully committed to our relationship. The best thing I did was quit it and move on. In saying that, it was hard, I was sad for such a long time. But in the end it was 100% worth it. No one should be in a relationship for the sake of it. You\u2019re also so young still, you\u2019ll understand when you\u2019re older. ",
            "Honey leave him, like yesterday.  Don't be that girl. You deserve better. Someone is going to love you even more. And if you have to start from zero then do it. Do it for yourself. Give yourself some love and respect.  Save your dignity and move on. Knowing what you know now there is absolutely no reason for you to stay. \n\nNow, pick your beautiful self up, look in the mirror. Wipe those tears away, wash your face. See how pretty you are. Now keep moving forward, don't stop. You will be fine. ",
            "Tell him thanks for not wasting anymore of you time and move on.",
            "Run, don't just walk, away! He will never love you the way that he loves his ex, and was clearly hoping that they would somehow get back together. You are still young, so don't waste another minute on someone who's first thought isn't you.",
            "I\u2019m sorry this is happening to you. Honestly I could never stay with someone who said that to me. I\u2019d never get over it. You deserve more than to be someone\u2019s second choice. End things with him so you find the guy who makes you his first choice ",
            "Good on him for being honest.   \n\nHe's with you because he doesn't want to be alone, which is why he went for a young beautiful woman.  He figures that he can mold you, and you'll put up with his bullshit.   At some point, maybe next year, or 2 years, or 5 years, not being alone won't be enough to keep him with you, and he'll leave.  Either because he found another \"one\", or the fact that you are only  a placeholder and he wants to be with someone he loves.    \n\nI know you think that if you love him enough when he finally finishes grieving he'll realize that you loved and supported him and he'll fall in love with you.  It won't happen, you are a placeholder, and you always will be a placeholder, no amount of love and support will change your status as a placeholder.  \n\nDon't sell yourself short because \"he's a good catch\".  If you consider marriage a business arrangement then stay with him, but if you consider marriage a bond of love and commitment then he's not your guy, he's not really anyone's guy, except for his ex and she's not available.  ",
            "Men have such a hard time with unrequited love. Just look at the hundreds of years of poetry and songs by men. As someone else said, doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t or doesn\u2019t love you too. It\u2019s complicated.  Best of luck to you. ",
            "I think you should break up and see if he fights for you. Test that relationship. If he moves on, he doesn\u2019t deserve you. \nC\u2019mon, you\u2019re more than this.",
            "You need to run the fuck away from your boyfriend, holy shit.  No matter how great someone is, don't stick with them if they're still hung up over an ex. ",
            "He should be an ex boyfriend by now",
            "sorry you had to go through that. personally, I hope you move on and find someone who thinks you're the best thing that ever happened to him.",
            "This shouldn't even be a question for you. Dump him. You deserve to be with someone that would pine for you if you left him. Let him pine for both you and his ex alone. ",
            "Wow..... I am very sad for you and I think you deserve better, but I also feel like this is something I would go through. I don\u2019t think I will ever love anyone more than my first love and any relationship after him will probably continue to be empty to me. This scares me because I would never want to put someone through what you\u2019re feeling right now. I\u2019m so sorry. I hope you find the love that you deserve. ",
            "I\u2019m sorry, what an incredibly cruel thing for him to say. You\u2019ll never be able to move on from this. ",
            "I think the problem is that will he leave you if he can date her again... I didn't think committing he has not yet so fell in love compare to you is such a bad thing...At least he knows and he is trying to do something??",
            "I\u2019m in a similar situation right now. I\u2019m no longer with my ex, and he wants to get back together. I know he genuinely cares about me but...his ex never really left his mind. So I have to tell him \u201cno\u201d again. \n\nIt\u2019s fucking hard though. I\u2019m only 22 (just like you) so I know that logically, I have time to meet more men. But it was my first relationship and I feel like I\u2019ll always be wondering if I\u2019m good enough. If I\u2019ll always be a consolation prize, the woman you settle for. \n\nI hope you find a way to be happy in spite of this. I hope you find someone way better than him ",
            "You go up. Let this man go and work on you. If you hold on to this, you will regret it. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this, but you need to mourn and work through this alone. Take it as a gift he validated for you what your intuition already knew and back away slowly. This has nothing to do with you, and everything to do with him. I am truly terribly sorry this has happened for your hurt feelings; but thank God you aren\u2019t married and try to separate what you know from what you feel, and move forward from there. ",
            "He's wrong about never loving someone else the same way again.  But you shouldn't wait around for him to find that out.",
            "Yeah you should dump him to spur his personal growth as an individual, you would literally be a hero to society. ",
            "Walk away. You\u2019re 22 and in your prime and you deserve to have someone to love you the way you need. You\u2019ll have guys beating down your door.",
            "No, it's not necessarily a normal thing to have \"one that got away.\" My husband and I both love each other more than we've ever loved anyone else. It has to work both ways and when it does you know you're with the right person. I suggest you move on. You deserve better. You deserve someone who thinks you're the best thing that ever happened to him. ",
            "You should become his latest ex girlfriend. Maybe then he\u2019ll actually appreciate you, OP.\n\nAlso, drunk words, sober thoughts, and all that.",
            "There are people in this world who would be just as crazy about you as you are about them. Don\u2019t leave them waiting any longer than you have to. \n\nAs for him, maybe he will love someone else someday, but it isn\u2019t going to be you. Wish him well in finding that person. Neither of you should settle.",
            "You are young.  Take the time to find someone who feels about you the way your bf feels about her.  \n\nThis guy will never feel that way about you and it will be there forever.  Don\u2019t be his second best for your entire life.",
            "I suggest you break up with him, because he is carrying extra baggage, and still hasn't moved on from his ex. It is not good for you to keep the relationship going, because it's extremely damaging to you. I've never been in a relationship, but let me tell you this if you stay with him, then you're going to be the one whose going to get hurt the most.",
            "Absolutely,  OP you need a real bf and lover who will love you more than  any any one else and forever.....do  not waste  one more minute on this guy you are describing here  thank god he was   honest   with   you !\n\nGet out now.  Just get out and  you \nneed to tomorrow start the hunt for your mr right!\n\n please take this advice and do the right thing by you  -  OP, \nDo the right thing.",
            "I would go do fun things without him for at least two weeks. I would limit contact to text message responses only when he tries to contact you. I would change all thoughts about him into thoughts about how something that you can do for you. After two weeks of celebrations all about you, check on how you feel about you spending time with him. If he initiates a contact, and you want to see where it goes, great. If not, I\u2019m sorry you are going to hurt for a long while over this.\n\nI\u2019m thinking he is experiencing run of the mill grief. He loves her. He lost her.\n\nI\u2019m still hurting from a divorce that happened 18 years ago. He had a stroke 2  years ago and that opened an old wound. We both moved on long ago. This is grief. It\u2019s weird like that. Also, men aren\u2019t taught about emotions the way women are. They don\u2019t get to really examine their emotions the same way. Hug. This is going to be ok.",
            "It looks like he was hoping that his ex gf\u2019s relationship wasn\u2019t going to last or wasn\u2019t as serious. since they ended on good terms and had such a long relationship he may feel like it was never meant to end or like he is missing out on the unknown. Like unfinished business. I think that you need to let him go for your best.\u2019 There is many great guys out there as long as you hold on to your values and standards. But before deciding to jump to another relationship make sure you first take some time to yourself and work on getting over your feelings for him because you do not want to end up doing the same thing he is doing to u to someone else ",
            "I dunno, I'm sure someone has said this but\n\n1) he's dumb. He'll for sure love someone more than his ex... and...\n\n2) he's not ready to love someone more than his ex, which means it's time for you to move on. It'll suck but will be so much better for you ",

            "This sucks but at least he's honest now so you can move on. You're young, there are others out there who have gotten over their exes.",
            "You need to break up with him. You do not want to be someones second choice and spend your life feeling second best, you deserve to be someones first choice! \n\nAlso your bf has been lying to you, don't be with someone who isn't brave enough to be honest with you. ",
            "I don\u2019t have any advice and I\u2019m sorry - all I can say is I cried reading this, it must have hurt so much and I\u2019m not here to tell you how sucky that must be, but I\u2019m seriously rooting for you to find someone who\u2019ll love you the way you deserve.",
            "What a heartbreak thing to read, dont allow yourself to be second best. it mustve been a shock for him to see his ex engaged especially if he feels like his life hasnt moved along as much as hers but he should be putting his all into you both and accepting that didnt work. it sounds like he simply moved from relationship to relationship to fill the void and never go that time to himself to be at peace with himself. id say if you wanna fix this a long serious talk is the only way to go otherwise question if you ever think he will let her go.",
            "He's just settling for you and you deserve so much more than being his second best. Move on from him. ",
            "I'm sorry - you're going to have to break up with him. In time it will wear you down that you're his second option, because option one isn't available, plus knowing that you can't give your partner what he wants? That'll make you go crazy. Do yourself a big favor and find someone who knows you're every they need.",
            "Oof. This is so hard to read and I'm so sorry you're going through this :(\n\nI might have a bit of a different perspective. I feel a bit like your boyfriend, in the sense that I was with an ex for two years, SIX YEARS AGO, and still find it hard to move on. I felt so much for this person but unlike your bf, it didn't end as nicely and we haven't talked since.\nI've tried therapy, being on my own, therapy again, briefly dating, single, etc. nothing has really helped. \n\nHowever, the difference is I know this about myself. And I have not allowed myself to ever start a relationship because I know it wouldn't be fair to the person. I've gone on a few dates where we both agreed it was casual and we had open communication. Once they told me they might have feelings, I'd tell them why I wanted casual as I was unsure about my own feelings.\n\nI did have my nice moments where I felt affection for others, and I genuinely 100% meant them. But I'm still struggling.\n\nIt's very, very likely I'm idolizing what we used to have. Maybe if I met her she'd be an ass to me and that would help move on. But it's been hard.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is you do not deserve this. Take time for yourself to think about this, as I do agree the times he's told you he's loved you he meant it 100%, but if I were you I'd also have a lot of trouble ever feeling... safe? I'd feel hurt I wasn't his #1. Some people can move past that, others can't. It doesn't make us better or less than, just different.\n\nAgain, I'm so sorry. Don't be alone, have a favorite meal, ask for time away. ",
            "That is brutal, but now you know where his heart lies. Don't ever settle for someone who cares for you less than you care for them.",
            "What he said cannot be unsaid. You deserve better and I think you know what you need to do. Find someone who wants to actively be with you.",
            "Your boyfriend was dating a 17-year-old girl when he was 22? Gross.",
            "Sounds like an awful situation but I think it\u2018s more common than we think.\nYour bf is very honest and I think that\u2018s a good thing.\nIt sucks for you bit I think that\u2018s nothing that stands against your relationship. (If you can get over it)",
            "Please dump him, you\u2019re so young and he is so stupid and you\u2019re in for a long line of pain. Trust me he is going to be objecting at that wedding, and you don\u2019t wanna his date when he does it",
            "I have exes that I don\u2019t hate (which drives my husband nuts) but I don\u2019t want to be with them at all. It\u2019s just that we broke up with mutual understanding and we\u2019ve moved on (think Thank u, next)\n\nI mean, I still think about my first love and contemplate my feelings about him, but he is in no way a viable candidate for anything in my life. \n\nYour guy still loves her. Sorry to say. You deserve one who isn\u2019t hung up on this old love. Harboring close friendships with ex loves where you are still ambiguous about it isn\u2019t okay. And it\u2019s not okay to string along the next person because of it. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is something worth breaking up over, or just taking a break. Maybe your guy just needs closure and isn\u2019t handling himself well, and needs a few months, but I would start focusing on yourself and giving him lots of space. ",
            "Sooo, any updates to this?",
            "I'm so sorry this happened to you. You asked where do you go from here. I will answer, but you won't like it: You LEAVE. Dump your BF b/c he admittedly is in love with his ex. You deserve someone who will love you and have the emotional bandwidth to love only YOU. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are very young.  There are SO MANY opportunities out there to meet someone whose focus will be you. Let yourself be available for him. ",
            "well break up jeez who the hell would wanna be in that relationship",
            "Break up with him, and tell his ex that he is still obsessed with her. Youre boyfriend had an unhealthy fixation on her and he need therapy.",
            "You might not see this but I can give some insight. I'm the same as your boyfriend right now, dating my girlfriend and still have a lot of feelings for my ex. But, even given the chance, I would never go back. Not because it was bad, not because I don't like them but because I love my girlfriend the now and all I want to do is get over my ex so I can be 100% with my girlfriend right now. Even if your boyfriend still loves his ex, he's dated you for over a year when he has been around his ex. If he wanted to be with his ex more than you, he wouldn't be with you right now",
            "I think maybe, and just hear me out here because I might be on to something. Talk to him about it before you decide, while he\u2019s sober of course but just see what he says and then if you feel like he\u2019s only with you because he can\u2019t be with her that\u2019s the time to move on. Everyone forgets to communicate, he was being honest and communicating with you so give him the exact same courtesy. Even if it\u2019s not easy it\u2019s what\u2019s needed tf what everyone else says they don\u2019t know the situation and your whole relationship. Think of all the good times vs the bad and if you think you can be happy with him despite what you know now. \n\nAll these other posters are gonna be bias because of their experiences but your the only one that knows your boyfriend. Something to also realize though is no love is ever going to be the same, expecially when he was with her for a longer time but who\u2019s to say those feelings he thinks he has are actually still there? Feelings are after all just feelings and after being with her for a short time he could realize it isn\u2019t what he wants anyway. You seem happy with the dude and he sounds pretty decent, I read somewhere that to have a lasting relationship you need forgiveness. Although it\u2019s to take into moderation of course. Best of luck to you op everything will work out well for you either way just stay positive.",
            "At least he is honest. But that sounds tough! I feel bad for you.",
            "People are being awfully hard on your boyfriend. From his perspective he's been trying hard to get past his emotions, and seeing her again clearly caused a relapse. The reality is a lot of us have had great loves, or at least some fantasy of a great love, and it's not always to easy to let go of the ghost completely. But that doesn't mean your whole relationship is a lie or you're some kind of consolation prize, just that he has feelings he can't quite let go. Being in love with someone doesn't always cancel prior feelings, and I wouldn't end the relationship over this - provided that he voluntarily cuts all contact with her.",
            "Men hah? Always about sex! ",
            "Least he\u2019s honest. I don\u2019t think you can blame him for feeling the way he feels. It\u2019s probably futile, but that\u2019s his problem not yours. Thank him for the good times, separate as quickly as you can, and you can ask him how it\u2019s all going when you and your new love interest have breakfast with him in 6 months. \n\nThat last bit was a joke. Unless it isn\u2019t. I can\u2019t imaging having breakfast with my ex and my current partner. ",

I believe everything happens for a reason so maybe you had to go through all this to get to be with the person that\u2019s meant for you. So talk to him tell him love you soo much but love myself more than to spend my life with a man in love with another woman i cant be second choice ",
            "This is awful, I'm not saying he is a horrible person or anything. He probably can't help his feelings for her, although I feel he shouldn't have committed himself to you when he knows in his heart that he could never commit 100%. You're very young, only a few years older than me. I know you want to spend your life with this guy, and it means nothing to hear that you will find someone else but you will. It's only fair to the both of you that the relationship doesn't continue. It will suck and hurt a lot for quite some time if you and him part ways, but you will find someone who cherishes you the way that he seems to cherish his ex. It may take a couple of years, but it will happen. I don't believe in soul mates, but I do believe that we all at least have one person that will come along in life that we are compatible with enough to have a wonderful life together. You will find your person, sadly it doesn't seem to be him. It seems like he does honestly care about you, but he may likely never have the will-power to completely get over her. I wish you the best of luck here! And I'm so sorry that you are in such a painful situation, I really do hope things turn out wonderful for you!",
            "I am sorry. This is hard. You need to accept it. There\u2019s nothing else you can do about it. You did nothing wrong.. his heart is just in a different place. \n\n\nFor you, wish him the best of luck and hope he finds what he looking for. Take care of yourself, focus on yourself, please do not blame yourself t has nothing to do with what you could or couldn\u2019t do. In the end think of it as fundamental incompatibility..take some personal time to digest all of this. Maybe a therapist will help. \nJust know there will be a man who will put you first above all. He is out there\n\n\nEven if you stay. It is possible he could still be agreat boyfriend to you. But you will not hold highest place in his love. She will. Can you build a relationship on that? Its not pleasant but he was honest. You can end it or work through it. ",
            "Ugh. Honestly, I don\u2019t think I could get past that. You\u2019re 22. Don\u2019t waste another one of your baby-making years on a man who is in love with someone else.\n\nYou deserve a man who wants to marry *you,* not some other woman. \n\nAt 22, you have a *lot* of dating options. Don\u2019t waste more years on this guy. So sorry he\u2019s still hung up on her. You deserve better.",
            "I am a boy and I can totally relate to your boyfriend's situation. I have been replacing girlfriends very frequently, with a hope of experiencing the feeling of being with my long lost ex girlfriend. It's weird and hard to admit, but I still have some hope, deep inside my heart that someday we will be together again. ",
            "I know your very hurt. I can somewhat relate...\nThere is a difference in my story, however. I was with a man for almost 7 years. At first things were perfect, I was inlove. We broke up on bad terms. I no longer feel anything for him. \nI got with someone else, and he had just gotten out of a relationship of 3 years. We got very close & he confessed to me the feelings he had for his ExEx! What u mean is not his most recent ex he was with for 3 years, but the one he was with for 8 years WELL before his ex! Like back in 2004! \nI was blown away. How can you spend 3 years with someone else and still love someone from 14 years ago! It\u2019s amusing to me how love can take a tole on someone like that. I was very bothered by I tried to shake it off & remember he\u2019s with me now. But she\u2019s so beautiful! I can\u2019t compare in the looks department I have about 49 lbs to lose and she has a perfect body. I used to worry she will try to come back one day and he\u2019ll leave me. But what u realized, is this- they broke up for a reason. And if she ever truly loved him the way he loved her, trust me they would have made it work some way some how. Love is such a strong emotion, distance would NOT interfere with true love trust me. Clearly, she didn\u2019t feel the same, but let\u2019s just say she did. There was some deeper reason they broke up then what your hearing. I also want you to remember that in the event she took him back and they \u201cmade it work\u201d it would not be the same. They lead different lives now, no way would they get back together and things would magically be the way they once were and I can guarantee you the only reason he\u2019s so emotional about it is because (while yeah, he may love her) the main reason this is getting to him is because he can\u2019t have her and it\u2019s in our nature to go after what we cannot have. She\u2019s clearly, very happy with her new fianc\u00e9. \n\nMy concern is your boyfriend and his intentions with you as well as his intentions with her! How dare him continue to go around a woman he\u2019s \u201cinlove\u201d with while he is with you & continues to string you along as if your his accessory for him to show off to her, to possibly make her jealous. If you are aware of feelings you have for someone else it\u2019s not at all respectful to bring your new boyfriend or girlfriend around this person. Your not his rebound, your a human being who deserves to be happy! And if he can\u2019t cut ties with her to end the love triangle he\u2019s trying to have with her, MAYBE you should consider leaving his ass and finding a man to worship the ground you walk on. And I can bet that if you walked away it would crush him because he can\u2019t have her, but now he has to live with seeing you with someone else too! It seems to me like he is just trying to keep in touch with her to keep that possible open but again that\u2019s not okay. \nYour worth more than that. \n\nI know it hurts because your inlove with him.

            "I went through something similar with my ex. He told me multiple times that if she showed up at our door he would leave me in a heartbeat for her. Always told me stories about her, reminiscing on times they had....all while never making me feel loved or important (in 2 years).\n\nIt sounds like your boyfriend isn't like that. I really believe he loves you, and I think he just needs some time to figure out what is going on in his head. When you truly, deeply love somebody you never get over it. It sucks, but it's true. Expecting him to drop every last inch of feelings for his ex that was once a huge part of his life is asking alot. If he isn't saying how bad he wants to be with her and isn't telling you he will leave you if she ever wanted him back, I don't think it's as bad as it seems.\n\nAsk yourself: when you hear him say \"I love you\" do you believe him? Is there any doubt in your mind that he does? Do you feel loved, appreciated, stable, and happy with him? If you do, just try to be supportive of him and help him through this. I know it's tough but right now, especially, he needs you. \n\nIf you DONT feel like hes honest when he says he loves you, then you know what you need to do. \n\nI'm sorry you have to go through this. It's not an easy situation either way. ",

But my family has no desire to meet or interact with Sam, and Sam is no stranger to familial neglect. As she only maintains a relationship with her sister who lives out of state, she is content with our urban, queer nuclear family (two moms, a pupper and cat.)\n\nI could get into Sam's family history (and type furiously) but suffice it to say, she is a success story in SPITE of her mother and extended family. Naturally, she's not keen on \"family\" and had a lot of hesitation surrounding marriage in the first place. We've been seeing a couple's therapist to set up our relationship with a strong foundation and work out any issues before the big C. (*Commiiiitment*)\n\n\nI had the opposite experience growing up. Had it not been for my family's attention and care, I would not be half the woman I am today. The reason I am able to communicate with you all is because of the sacrifices my parents made to ensure we moved to a country with better economic opportunities. We're immigrants from a small latin country-- family is everything.  \n\nOf course there's tension because I'm queerful, but it's been 6 years since the other big C (*cooming oouut*) and my parents have grown more tolerant. My partner never comes up in conversation nor do they inquire about my personal life. They know of her, know we bought a house and raised a dog (they love the dog) but they're always side stepping calling her my SO. Occasionally, my mother humors me when I talk about her, but she's not  enthused. It may not be the right time, but I at least have been pushing for Sam to join the family for Christmas. No promises were made, just hand wavy maybes.\n\nSam would like to be included, in the sort of way someone entertains fanciful fantasies. She wants to impress my family, hang out with my sisters (they have come to the house once before. They're supportive.) However, she is fine waiting until they're more receptive.\n\nAm I pushing too much? Am I not pushing enough? Is there a timeline with these things, or an order of operations? I don't want to put wedding plans on hold because my family hasn't exactly gotten to know the bride yet. Sam isn't crazy about weddings anyway.\n\nThe big kicker is telling my parents about getting hitched. The even bigger kicker is having to tell my Dad we're doing a post-nup (like a pre-nup, but after the wedding.) Can't avoid that one since I'm going to need his access to a lawyer.\n\nHow do I work up the courage to ask for respect and inclusion? \n\nThanks so much in advance. \n\nTL;DR You don't have to be gay to understand how upsetting it can be to know your relationship will never be celebrated by your parents.",

            "You can't make them OK with it, all you can do is let them know what's happening, that you'd like them to be included, what your expectations are, etc. They'll either get on board or not. Ultimately adulthood is taken, not granted, and dealing with your parents as equal adults rather than some higher authority is a big part of that. Their acceptance or lack of it doesn't have to determine your life choices. It doesn't even have to be an ultimatum, but it may end up playing out like one, whereby if they persist in avoiding your girlfriend, then fiancee, then wife, they'll end up having minimal relationship with you as well. That's not you making them choose, that's just a decision they're making.",

Basically if someone wasn\u2019t okay with me then they weren\u2019t okay with her. I can\u2019t imagine having a partner who was so okay excluding me from their family. IMO you should stick by your partner more, grow a little more spine when it comes to your parents. Btw your parents don\u2019t respect her or your relationships from the looks of this post.

Those are their options. \n\nThen, if the family is important to you and Sam, work your other angles! Your sisters are supportive. Invite them around more often. Let your parents feel a bit left out of the \"family\" you are creating with those who are fully supportive. Keep inviting the parents. Keep insisting they be more than merely tolerant if they are gonna show. \n\nStop pushing for a Chrismas invite. Even most straight couples don't start with Christmas invites if they can help it. That's intense. Invite your parents to brunch or something. You've allowed this stalemate to go on for far too long. You're not going to know the answers to the questions of how tolerant your parents really are until you ask them to step out of the comfortable in-between space you've all left them in for years. \n\nMaybe they'll surprise you. Maybe they won't. Either way, you won't be able to make the plans you want too with any certainty, until you start -- not pushing 'em necessarily -- but inviting them in, knowing that invite might be a challege. You need to stop leaving the ball in thier court because they are most comfortable just not picking it up. If your invitations and joy get met with judgement and refusal, go ahead with your life without them. Hope they'll join you when they are ready too. ",

They're not being polite - there's nothing 'polite' about refusing to meet their child's SO just because of their gender, there's nothing polite about them 'sidestepping' refusing to call her your SO. \n\nYou really need to draw boundaries and expectations with your family because while it sounds like Sam has been more than understanding and accommodating, that's only going to last so long. Not to mention that this may be hurting or damaging her and your relationship more than you think, or certainly has the potential to if it continues to go on. \n\nIt's time for you to talk to your family, make it clear that Sam isn't going anywhere and that you expect more of them as your family. It sounds as though your family is being 'tolerant' by shoving their heads firmly in the sand about the reality of your relationship. ",

But you\u2019re starting a new family where the core needs to be your relationship with Sam. Your parents refusing to treat Sam as part of your family is an insult to her and infantilizing to you. \n\nI would tell them that she is your partner, and that if she is not welcome in their home you will consider yourself not welcome as well. This may mean making alternative holiday arrangements with your siblings. \n\nBased on your past relationship with your parents I think they will get on board eventually, but if you don\u2019t put your foot down they will keep excluding Sam indefinitely. They\u2019re doing it right now because you\u2019re letting them get away with it. ",

I'm lucky that my immediate family are all very supportive. On the other hand, my extended family are vaguely uncomfortable with the whole Queer thing... but I don't give a single fuck. My fianc\u00e9e is family now, so she's coming to Christmas. Deal with it. \n\nI honestly would not be able to be with someone who isn't Out to their family - you say you came out, but you're not acting like it. Treat your fianc\u00e9e like a fianc\u00e9- if a man would be invited, then she should be invited.\n\nIf your family makes it uncomfortable for you both, then neither of you go.\n\nStand up for her, and stop closeting yourself. The only way they'll get used to it is if they interact with your fianc\u00e9e, and you should start now.",
            "Here are my thoughts...  You should sit down with your parents.  I think there has been a lot of luck here (in a way).  Your parents have needed some time to get used to the whole gay thing and Sam has not really been interested in family, so being a bit standoffish hasn't hurt anyone.\n\nHOWEVER, that is going to start changing.\n\nI think you should sit your parents down and tell them the relationship is getting more serious and they need to seriously start thinking about integrating Sam into the family.  And that should start with some activities together.  Them getting to know her, her getting to experience the family.  \n\nI would tell them about Sam's shitty family life before this.  I would tell them that because of this the stakes are pretty high for being able to integrate her well and again while you can start small and work your way up over a few months, they need to understand the dynamic.\n\nThen schedule a lot of activities together, smaller ones at first to give them a chance to get to know her.  And finally maybe set up some kind of family trip or long weekend retreat together (or some kind of big family party).  \n\nThey don't sound like bad people, which makes me think progressive exposure is the best way to let them adjust.",

You can't make your parents change, but you can change how you interact with them and how you stand up to them. Make your partner the priority she deserves to be.",
            "I don't find their behavior to be polite, as you claim in your title, in the slightest. Just because they're not out-and-out mean doesn't make their behavior any less asshole-y. It's bigotry, prejudice and homophobia, it's not polite or kind.\n\nThis is the person you have built a home and a life with and they refuse to meet her. That's blatant disrespect. While being angry and bitter isn't going to help, it's OK to not be OK with that. You don't have to be so damn understanding of their bigotry.\n\nHonestly, if I was with someone for that long, had a home and pets, and my partner continued to tiptoe around the issue with their family, I'd be eyeing the door. If my partner wanted to marry me but wouldn't tell their family, I'd be eyeing the door; I would never be OK with being someone's dirty little secret when I was not the problem. You can't make these people accept your partner, but you also don't have to continue to walk on eggshells about this. Your partner should come first. It sounds like it's well past time to take a stand on this and be open with them. Whether they deal with it well is beyond your control, but keeping quiet shouldn't be an option at this point.\n\nIf they are unwilling to acknowledge your partner, it might be time to start limiting contact with them. And I would not attend family gatherings where my partner was not welcome. Right now they're essentially making you choose between them and your partner (at least while you are with them), and you are choosing them. You need to take a hard look at your priorities here.

I'd start with going to see them and asking them to place their cards on the table? Why wont they? Is this still a problem for them even now? Are they disappointed in you, or even disgusted by you? (You may not like the answers)\n\nBecause until you know the answers I don't see how you can move forward. \n\nAt least they havent disowned you. It may just take longer for them to buy in to your life, they may never manage. But you are correct that pushing them faster than they want to go, that  won't work",

Talk to a lawyer on your own and see if they can help you navigate the situation without your parents cooperation. You might end up having to go forward without whatever help you need from them.",
            "I'm also a gay lady with parents (super conservative) who weren't down with my partner (now fiance\u00e9) for a long time. My dad did the awkward avoidance/gloss over thing (\"oh that's nice. How about them Flyers?\") and my mom straight up refused to acknowledge my relationship. She would refer to my then-girlfriend mostly as my \"friend,\" and when pushed would just refer to her by her first name. I had to have a coming to jesus conversation with my mom about respecting my relationship. It got pretty tense, but she apparently got over it, because 3 days after we got engaged, she was asking about grandkids. \n\nI think it's often hard for us to stand up for our relationships and ourselves. We've accepted a much lower bar for how we should be treated, so when someone tolerates us (vs accepting us) we go with it. But it sounds like your parents are barely tolerating your relationship, and not so much your partner. The fact that they *could* be shittier doesn't make their current behavior acceptable.\n",
            "So I was in a very similar situation. Came out gay and my parents had a hard time accepting it (REALLY bad at first). They made improvements towards being more accepting but plateaued where it seems your parents have. \n\nWe really avoided talking about my then-girlfriend in conversation, my being gay rarely came up, and she wasn\u2019t invited to my family gatherings. \n\nEventually I just had to grow a spine. Started talking about her instead of avoiding it. Talked about friends who were gay. I also had to tell them I wasn\u2019t coming around unless she was welcome. They tried calling me and getting their daughter time via phone but I had to end the calls early and let them know why. \n\nThey did some ridiculous things to get over it, but they did. (Like meet with their pastor and other religious friends, etc). Now they\u2019re big advocates against gay misconceptions and for gay rights at their church and other friend groups. \n\nAnyway. The point is you need to grow a backbone and start putting your foot down and letting them know their behavior is not OK. It sucks at first cause you know they\u2019re disappointed and that hurts. But it\u2019s the right thing to do, for you and your fianc\u00e9. ",
            "> The even bigger kicker is having to tell my Dad we're doing a post-nup (like a pre-nup, but after the wedding.) Can't avoid that one since I'm going to need his access to a lawyer.\n\nAs a former lawyer, this makes no sense to me at all. There are so many lawyers out there; what makes your dad a gatekeeper for the profession? When you need a plumber or an electrician or a dentist, do you go to your father to ask permission and help? Hire a lawyer just as you hire any other professional. Also not clear why it has to be a postnup rather than a prenup, but I don't really care about that. The dynamic about how you absolutely cannot do this without your father's \"access to a lawyer\" is what seems so bizarre. \n\nFor this, you need not one but two lawyers: one for you and one for your beloved. So even if the thing was your dad had some amazing lawyer on tap, you'd still need another one. They should be family law practitioners. And you can find them by googling, calling your local bar association for some names of family law attorneys, or asking people you know who got divorced or got a prenup whether they liked their attorney (word of mouth is the best).\n\nAs for the other family issues, maybe just the next time you have a get together, tell them -- the key is DON'T ASK, TELL -- you will bei bringing your partner. Then show up with your sweetheart. Don't wait for a special invitation for her because it's not happening. Force the issue.",

Sam seems interested in being more involved through that avenue as do your sisters. Maybe good experiences with Sam and your sisters will spill over into your parents perceptions.\n\nI have no real way of gauging your parents thoughts, but truly from what you have written I do not think they have really accepted you. Since they will not accept that, they can\u2019t accept sam as anything other than a roommate/friend. If they did then they would be accepting you as well.",

            "\n\nFirst off, congratulations on your wonderful relationship. Your parents have choices and adjustments to make, ones that they may feel are disruptive to their lives.  Marriage is another passage separate from coming out. Although they love you queer, seems like they have  a ways to go from more tolerant to fully loving and proud. \n\nMarriage is social. It involves extended family and tribe. Marrying a woman may be a huge step for them in terms of optics and what's accepted in their circle.  I guess what I'm saying is you're out, they love you out, and eventually may love Sam as an individual and you both as spouses. But reactions from others could be disruptive and go on for a long time. It's this -- strife from friends, family, etc.-- they may be afraid of, even fear of being judged or even cut by other people they value. And then there are attitudes and beliefs.\n\n>it's been 6 years since the other big C (*cooming oouut*) and my parents have grown more tolerant. My partner never comes up in conversation nor do they inquire about my personal life.\n\nYou say they know her, but sounds like their full acceptance of you as a couple is just inching along. They're still in full acceptance mode of you as queer. Wjay are ways you could help humanize Sam, so they see her first as someone who loves you and holds your happiness as a priority rather than just a woman [*gasp*] who wants their baby?\n\nHolidays are *the* worst time to do something like this without staging and advance work. Nack off the holiday campaign. If you can, be direct and loving without being confrontational or begging. The facts are you're in a permanent live in relationship leading to be marriage. \n \nAsked them over to dinner yet? If you did and they made lame excuses, ask again. However this may seem too one on one to them. A sure fire way to get dads involved in your home if they're handy is to plan a project -- redoing something, painting, redesigning the garden -- and ask for their help. Even if they're not handy, but you could use extra hands.  You can invite other friends too, make it a working party.  Other low pressure activities like whatever they like to do recreationally, outside, invite you and your girl along. \n\nIt's all about acclimatizing them, lettimg them become accepting of this  next stage and seeing  that it doesn't have to be disruptive.  Taking the initiative to stay clear-eyed and true to what you value, without emotionally confronting them is key. It's hard work, but your therapist is there to help you.  And in all likelihood this would be hard even if you weren't queer. If Sam isn't of Latin heritage that could factor in too. They want you to be happy. Create situations where they can see that you are. Before the holiday. \n\nIf there are mutual friends and family that are already into you two as a couple, involve them as your informal allies. The more your parents see people in your circle accept and value you, the easier it will be for them. \n\nAnd I don't get it about the lawyer. Why don't you get your own?\n\nTL:dr.  You and your parents love each other. Sam and you love each other. Open your arms wide and connect the dots. ",

Hopefully she is in INDIVIDUAL therapy to work on her family history~~.\n\n**Edit**: Because 33 came first, I mixed up the ages. Sam should still be in individual therapy. Oftentimes being gay (or bi or trans & et cetera) stunts growth because you're denied an original coming of age (suppression of identity and participation in heteronormative exploration of sexuality) and coming out is like a do-over on puberty. Abuse also stunts growth. I am *not* giving either case a get out of jail free to bring that burden to a still-developing person's table, just laying it out. Sam will have to be the one working through her shit and making sure it isn't unduly impacting you. Be aware that you are still developing neurologically and that you've spent three huge formative years with her, so you may have to check what you take for granted as normal and make sure it actually is.

They disrespect and reject your identity, and they disrespect and reject your choices (in who you're with on an individual level, not the \"choice\" to be gay). DO NOT force that on Sam. Demand better for yourself. You are an adult, and family is everything, *so why aren't your parents treating you thusly*?\n\nIf your parents can't/won't acknowledge who you actually are, they're not actually having a relationship with you, they're avoiding reality and hoping you'll snap out of it and become the person they expect you to be. Shut that shit down.\n\nIf they won't call her your SO, prompt them to when they omit it. For example, if they say \"your (special) friend Sam\" or \"that woman\" or whatever it is they're saying, just say the title you want like you're correcting them saying her name wrong. Don't avoid these conflicts, because they should have been ironed out well before you were three years in and six years out. Your parents don't need six years to respect their adult daughter, but you've apparently been allowing them to tiptoe around you and play out their fantasy where you don't have another woman in your house with your dog.\n\nUntil they see you for who you are, bringing Sam to them will only retraumatize her.",

If they would welcome a male partner, then they should welcome yours and I can understand how hurtful their homophobia is. And if they don't that accept your partner because of her gender - then that is their problem, and not one you need to endure. \n  \nMaybe you could try a more casual BBQ or something at your house, have Sam there, introduce everyone. Or tickets to an event or something - just some occasion where there is something to \"do\" and less emotionally charged then Christmas. And once that bandaid is ripped off then it's a monthly brunch or a day at a beach and come Thanksgiving everyone is used to everyone else. They don't have to like it, they just need to extend kindness to your partner because they love you.

It's well past time that you insist they accept you for who you are or just stop interacting with them at all.\n\nTell them you and Sam are getting married.  And they need to stop pretending and stop the polite fictions.  Tell them how much they mean to you, how much you love and honour them and respect the sacrifices they have made.  \n\nHowever, by getting married you are starting a new family and that family needs to take the priority over your parental family.  This is not unreasonable and is the exact same process any couple would go through.  Once married your wife and children (if/when applicable) become your number one priority, parents and siblings become the second tier.  Still important, but they no longer play the central role that they once did.  This need not be a bad thing, it's natural, its the start of a new phase in your lives.\n\nLay down some ground rules.  Wherever you are invited, Sam is also invited by default.  If you do not want her to attend an occasion, don't invite you. In addition, she must be acknowledged as your wife, not your \"special friend\" or whatever fiction makes them comfortable.  If they have friends who they haven't told or don't know, now is the time to tell them because it will just come out in the future and make everyone feel bad.  \n\nLastly, family holidays will always be spent with your wife.  This may or may not include your parents and siblings, that choice is theirs, but from the wedding onwards the idea of separate holidays is no longer a thing in your life.  You will be a unit in the eyes of the law and god, and you expect them to treat her as such.\n\nStress that having a gay child is never easy.  Parents have dreams about what their child's life will be like and it can be very difficult for those dreams to change when it turns out the child wants something different.  Say that you respect how difficult this has been for them, but it's time for them to take the next step.\n\nIf you haven't already I would also tell them that Sam's parents did not accept her sexuality and this has caused a permanent rift in their relationship, tell them that Sam does not have contact with her parents because they've turned their back on her. Say that you are thankful that they didn't react that way with you, but the time for half measures is over.  In addition. because of Sam's damaged relationship with her own parents, she is sensitive to people not respecting her or her sexuality, so you better never see anything like that from them or you will be forced to step in and protect your wife.  \n\nBasically, it all boils down to them needing to shit or get off the pot.\n\nWith regards to the post-nuptial agreement.  Just deal with that after the main issue.  I assume you come from money and that your parents may be concerned.  If they bring it up, feel free to disclose your plans here and ask for the required legal help.  Otherwise, it's a topic for another conversation. \n",

Your parents may or may not come around, but you should proceed with wedding planning as you wish. You can't control them or force them to participate and it wouldn't be good for anyone if you did. \n\nAre there any family members that would be enthusiastic to meet her? Could you invite them for a visit and encourage them to report back how great you're doing and how in love you both are? Hell, have them help pick the engagement announcements you're going to send out. I think it would be great to show her that there are family members that accept her and are excited for you.   \n\n\nHopefully your parents will come around, but the whole point of marriage is to build a new immediate family and she's it. Ditching her for holidays wouldn't really be appropriate since she didn't do anything wrong and is going out of her way to be patient and compassionate with your parents' wishes.   \n",

I am your child and asking me to basically choose between my family which you know is important to me, and my happiness and love of my life is just wrong. by the way, we are getting married so if you can't accept her and at least give her a chance, then don't bother coming to my wedding. Call me if you change your mind and maybe we can set up a get to know each other dinner. Peace\"\n\nYour fiancee should be #1.

Tell them they're going to miss out on seeing you if they keep refusing to accept you and love you for who they are.  Then don't see them for a bit and leave them to think about it.  Refuse to return to the family fold until both you and Sam are welcome.  Stand up for her and show her that *she's* your family now.

            ">Is there a timeline with these things, or an order of operations? \n\nIf you want your parents to have any involvement in the wedding at all (including even just attending) then you need to push them harder and soon. You don't want this hanging over your head when the wedding approaches. You don't want to be in a situation where you're wondering if your parents are going to show up or not, or wondering whether they're going to make a scene at the wedding or not. You don't want to be dealing with the emotional fallout of them outrightly rejecting your fiance and your identity as you're actually planning the wedding. I assume you haven't pushed too much because deep down you're scared they'll reject you. I get it; I do that with many of my family members. But that stops working so well when there's another person and a wedding involved. I think you need to figure out what you expect from your parents. If you don't really expect anything from them and don't want them at the wedding, then whatever, move on with the planning. But if you want them to have a relationship with Sam and take part in your wedding, you need to figure out pretty soon whether that's possible. Because if it's not possible, you're going to need space to process that and trying to plan a wedding on top of it will not be fun.\n\nedit: I'm not blaming you for how you've handled your family because again, I really do understand. But I would be really hurt if a partner's parents were more willing to engage with my dog than with me. You should have a real heart-to-heart with Sam about how she feels about all this. Maybe she's okay with it, or maybe the fantasy of having a relationship with your parents is so appealing to her that she's willing to wait around for years to see if it happens. But I'm not sure I'd be okay with that. \n\nIf you do elect to keep trying, you should consider whether your sisters would be willing to help. They have a relationship with Sam and are more okay with your queerness than your parents are. It's possible they could run interference for you here.",

I have seen this type of situation where there is no race or LGBT+ element. Sometimes parents and family just don\u2019t like the reality of who or what their child is/wants/chose in certain aspects of their lives. It doesn\u2019t make the family bad people or put them in the wrong.\n\nOP has the right to be who she is, love whoever she wants etc etc etc and OP\u2019s family also have the right to decide who they do or do not want to meet or join their family gatherings.\n\nIn my opinion it\u2019s a plus that they don\u2019t speak or do massively negative things. They chose to not focus on that part of OP\u2019s life and kinda bury their heads in the sand so they can keep enjoying time with their daughter/sister.\n\nIt kinda goes into the \u201clive and let live\u201d principle.",

This is the side I'm coming from so my advice is to nurture those relationships to give your SO the family experience without losing it for yourself, but your parents...everyone else seems to have covered that pretty well.  \n  \nMy husband's sister married her wife a couple of years ago. My in-laws are East Asian and Christian and...not supportive. My husband was more interested in warning his sister not to rush into anything and work on herself to realize what she needed was support. So I pushed him.  \n  \nWe are their family, and I made sure to include her spouse the same way I would want to be included. The relationship between our families is now irreplaceable. They are wonderful aunts and people. We exchange gifts and postcards and keep track of each other. They are the ones who will take our kids if something happened to us.  \n  \nMy point is, put your spouse first and water the grass where the sun shines. ",

Not that it's saying you're not sure about the wedding, but otherwise you could end up putting down deposits and then having to reschedule or something because of drama.  If there's any static now, it'll just be magnified at your wedding.  And if you can't resolve it, hopefully they'll at least have reached an understanding and have more of an established dynamic after trying.  If right now they don't approve AND they don't know her, then after some attempts at forcing the issue they should at least know her. Congrats on finding someone you can date for 3 years and still want to marry!  \n\nMy family is a little iffy w/my current girlfriend too, I care but not nearly as much as I do about the relationship.  I know there's a huge difference between that and your family not really liking your relationship because you're gay, maybe they were hoping it was a phase or something.  Maybe they need more exposure to the subject, idk you said you've had talks w/your mom where she \"humored\" you, though.

            "Your parents are still homophobic. They just about tolerate you because you're their daughter and they love you, but they STILL have not really accepted who you are. They only accept you as long as you don't remind them who you are and they can continue pretending you're who they want you to be. They are holding out for you to grow out of this \"phase\" and settle down with a nice man and give them grandkids. Fundamentally, and I know this is hard to hear, they don't love you unconditionally the way parents should love their kids, they only love you if you fit the mold they want you to.\n\nThey will not give you respect & inclusion till they can let go of their homophobia. The fact that they still haven't in 6 years is not a good sign. In some way's that is because you have made their homophobia acceptable (I am NOT blaming you, of course), to some extent you've played along. Now, sometimes to have an easier life or to keep people you love in your life despite flaws, that's an ok choice. But when you have the wants you have, about your future wife being accepted and for them to respect you both... enabling and rug-sweeping their homophobia isn't a good strategy.\n\nYou need to decide what you want more: a) Parents who fully love and respect you unconditionally and who will give your spouse the same chance to integrate into the family as they would if you were not in a same sex relationship or b) Settling for parents who don't really love you and won't respect or even acknowledge your spouse.\n\nIf you can accept b and continue the charade of not acknowledging your orientation and spouse, then stop pushing them. Certainly don't push your future spouse to make herself acceptable to them, protect her from their homophobia, make sure you don't choose to spend time with them when you could with her. Don't let her beat herself up for their homophobia.\n\nIf you want a... that's hard. You need to make it clear to your parents that their homophobia is no longer acceptable, you need to pick your future spouse over them. If they can't love you unconditionally, then they don't get to be part of your life. Lay down an ultimatum, if they aren't willing to lose the homophobia, they will lose you, because this is who you are and you're going to be marrying your partner and she's going to be your new family. If they don't want to accept that and embrace you BOTH, then they don't get to be part of your family. Go no contact till they can humble themselves enough to reach out and show you they have gotten past their homophobia.\n\nNo contact might last a week, it might last the rest of your life. But you will be choosing yourself and your spouse, and a life lived with integrity and full expression of who you are, not one that's divided and crippled by people who don't accept who you really are.",

Make them see her as a person rather than a stereotype or a faceless stranger who is corrupting their daughter.  \n\nAlso, ask your mom if she would want to be invited to a family function on condition that your dad not come.

Then we moved across the country together and got married shortly after that. I told my grandparents when it would be so that they could get traveling itineraries figured out. My grandma would not commit to coming for the longest time because she is religious. She felt that by going she was essentially showing support for my damnation or who actually knows what she thought.

Here's the ringer - you need to talk to your parents flat out about where you see your relationship going with your SO, and what you need from them in your relationship. Not saying you need ultimatums, but you do need to figure out why they aren't enthused about meeting the person that you want to spend the rest of your life with. I think you haven't asked because the answer is probably somewhat homophobic, but if they become more accepting every year, they might also be changing their minds, or adapting. I would let them know how much family means to you, and that it hurts you that they aren't as excited for you. I dont think it would be a good idea to bring your SO around until this is sorted because she has already dealt with her families poor reactions, and she doesn't need to feel this.\n\nI also suggest that if your parents continue to not want to be involved, that you be less involved with them.

Enough time has passed that having her come by your house while you get something, or having a casual lunch shouldn't be a big deal.\n\nI'm not saying you need to shove the relationship down their throats, but they need to see that you're serious about dating women, serious about your girlfriend, and are serious about marrying another woman. They need to learn that they can't ignore the white elephant in the room and pretend everything is normal because they don't have to deal with it. \n\nYour girlfriend is being very understanding, but I'm absolutely certain this cuts deeper than she's vocalizing to you, especially if she hasn't seen you put in effort to try to include you with family events. I know you've asked for her to be included, but have you actually told your parents, \"I'm going to bring ____ over on Saturday for lunch.\" and let them be the bad guys by repeatedly rejecting the offers? \n\nIf you wait for your parents to invite her over, they will just keep putting it off.

            "Your parents are bigots who dont accept your sexuality but hey it's fine because they avoid the subject and don't say anything TOO homophobic in your presence.  You should push a LOT more and if they dont become receptive, you should dial-back your relationship with them.  You can't spend christmasses with a group of people who don't acknowledge the existence or importance of your life partner.\n\nAlso lawyermode-on: Why would you do a post-nup?  They are rarely enforceable (they dont work).",

            "OP the best advise you have gotten here is about being an adult and accepting reality. You love your SO and you love your family. You can have both in your life but you are gonna need to accept the realities around it. You won\u2019t get to all hang out and be 1 big happy family.\n\nYour family will not be 100% comfortable having you SO around as your partner. That\u2019s not what they want for them and I guess it\u2019s not what they wanted for you. This is just a fact. \n\nIf you force your SO on them then it will just be uncomfortable with the risk of going south fast and hard. You can have a look at some of the posts here on Reddit that make you say \u201cOP should have just enjoyed life with their SO and visited family when they missed them\u201d. It sounds like you have a great SO so I\u2019m sure they will support you when you make the best decision for your happiness.\n\nSo yes it sucks but life does that sometimes. My advice is to make lemonade with the lemons and not do anything drastic like forcing the situation or cutting family out of your life. All the best....",
            "OP, as you grow you'll rapidly become more and more on a peer level with your parents and realize two things: First, you can't change their minds and make them think or feel a certain way anymore than you could any other competent adults. What they think or believe is not yours to decide. Second, the same as above but in regards to you. Your parents can't change *your* mind and make you think or feel a certain way anymore than they could another adult. What you think or believe is your business not theirs and it will be your responsibility to establish that fact, both for them and more importantly for you. Once you have decided that your thoughts and beliefs are yours alone, you will feel less and less concerned about what they think or believe. If they are the loving and supportive parents that they seem to be, based on what you said, then they  will still support and love you no matter what you decide. Depending on some of your decisions, your differences may make some conversations with them uncomfortable, with some awkwardness sprinkled upon your interactions with them, but that's all part of growing up and becoming an independent adult. The point is that they will still be card carrying member of Team You. They have to love you, not necessarily your decisions. An important thing for you to remember is that the same applies to you. They're under no more obligation to align with your life than you are with theirs. If you and your family remember this and choose to live with it as a reality of life, you'll all get along fine. I guess to make it more specific to your situation, you might have to get used to the idea that they may not want to be involved in the wedding. If that's what they decide, it will ABSOLUTELY sting, but it'll be their choice, and it will be your choice of how you will respond to it. Keep in mind, there's no right or wrong answer to the question \"how will you respond?\", there are only choices and the consequences thereof, and it is based on these consequences that you will have to decide which choice was the right one for you. Whatever happens, I understand how tough these things can be with a tight-knit family and how much it can hurt to suddenly not be on the same page as them anymore, so I wish you the very best with this and try to keep in mind that they are just humans who are capable of both good and bad choices, same as you, and any poor decisions they make likely won't be made out of any malice towards you and so you should be ready to try and forgive them should their decision end up hurting you, which is once again: your choice. All the best! ",
            "Your parents are terrible people. Sorry, but it's true. These kind of backward ideas have no place in our society and need to be stamped out. Give them an ultimatum to step up and say goodbye. ",
            "If you want Sam to be a part of your immediate family you must insist that she is included in family plans. You can refuse to attend family functions unless she is included. Bottom line your parents don't have to accept your relationship, but it's not fair to her to be excluded. If you continue with to allow this they will never get to know her and never grow comfortable. I am a lesbian as well and yes my parents were very slow to come around, but once they got to know my now wife they grew to love her and accept our relationship. There are still a few people my mom doesnt openly tell that I am married to a woman, but whatever. You can postpone the wedding and do it later, there is no rush. For now it's on YOU to correct them and stand up to your family.",
            "Not pushing for the acceptance of your future wife is kinda...hard for me to believe. Family is important to some people I get that, but if you're serious about marrying this woman you need to get your priorities straight. First off you KNOW she had a bad childhood with non-supportive parents. Now you're willing to let her deal with the same with her in-laws. That's seriously messed up and selfish. You need to decide what's more important to you, your relationship with your homophobic family or your relationship with your NEW family. \n\nMake a decision soon, and if they're not ok with you marrying this woman then cut them out, and make sure she knows that SHE comes first above all else. And if that's not what you want to do then maybe you shouldn't be marrying her.",
            "You should prioritize your partner's actual comfort over the mere principle of involving her.\n\nYou should only assert your relationship with your family within the bounds of your partners comfort-- otherwise you're basically defeating the point.\n\nMake sure you're never putting your partner in an uncomfortable situation she is not fully on board with.",
            "I used to work at an LGBT Center in Southern California and we had connections to more than one organization that helps family and friends of  queer folk have some support and connect to other people who have been in their position before. \n\nPFLAG is the largest general one and we also had connections to local groups specifically for Latino families with queer members.\n\nSee if there\u2019s one local to you and if not check to see what kind of online support there is. Some parents were able to talk to other parents with similar cultural values who had been in the same situation and were able to integrate and welcome a queer kid, or queer marriage into their life. \n\nIt can really help so hear about someone who has been able to have both their cultural values and the ability to love their kid and accept their partners. And if that isn\u2019t successful many people who weren\u2019t able to get their parents to come around gathered \u2018adopted\u2019 family to have some queer positive Tias and Abuelas. Good luck. ",
            "I am sorry that you are in this conflicted situation.\nThe courage part comes from setting expectations.  HOw likely is it that they are going to accept no matter what words you say or don't say.  You can't count on that to happen.  Expect they won't.  Prepare that they won't.  And then ask yourself if facing that is worth the pain you will face when they don't.\n( I realize there is always a possibility- but for courage, assume there is none).\n\nAnd no matter what- you are an adult and if you made the overture and they rejected- it is on them. Totally.  I feel for you- it is a hard thing to want, need to be accepted and have it seem so reasonable to expect that from your parents but not get it.  Lots of folks go through this with parents who are narcisstic or have personality disorders.  It may or may not be helpful to look at some strategies and coping mechanisms they employ.  I don't know that you have to go No contact, but perhaps learning to accept and not have expectations and limit what you do with them, is the best choice you can make for yourself.  ",
            "Well that sucks for them.  They're missing a huge step in their child's life and it's because they can't grow up.  That might be me putting it harshly, but no matter how you split it... this isn't on you and there's nothing more you can do.\n\nSend them an invite and make sure you hold the door open for them so long as they keep being polite, but other than that there's nothing more you can do",
            "Turn the tables. Invite them to come to your place for the holidays.  Then the onus is on them, not you.  It should be as simple as this:  Some people like Coke, some people like Pepsi.  Some like both.  If they can\u2019t find something to like in your partner, then they don\u2019t deserve either of you. Life is too short for unnecessary drama. My cousin tried to kill himself because he is gay.  He was certain his mom wouldn\u2019t accept him.  But she already knew and was just waiting for him to Come out.  We all knew.  And she loved his boyfriend.   Life has many twists and turns so live yours the way you see fit.   They can either accept her or not.   No loss if they don\u2019t make the effort.  Trust me, if they turn their backs on you as a couple, they won\u2019t be happy within themselves.  Good luck with the wedding!",
            "This post is making me sad. :( I'm so sorry you're stuck in this situation. I'm your age and also queer. Your family is *not* being polite, they're being homophobic. They're not being aggressive or disowning you, but this is still homophobia and they are in the wrong here.\n\nWhat have your partner and you done for past christmases? Do you leave her to go to your family? Does she have somewhere to spend the holiday? It's so so so not okay for them to exclude her and imo it's not okay for you to abandon her to spend the holiday with your intolerant parents. I understand where you're coming from and that your family is really important to you, but your partner is also your family and you really need to stick up for her. You don't need to be aggressive or even pushy about it, but I really think you should tell your parents that you will only come to Christmas if your partner (who is your family!) is invited.",
