        "selftext": "My husband [30M] and I [28M] have a 6 week old baby daughter. I am currently a stay at home dad and taking on most of the childcare. Occasionally my MIL has been helping me out but it has been causing a lot more stress than usual since she has been staying over and sleeping in our guest room.\n\nThose past weeks we have been dealing a lot with baby colic. She has been difficult to comfort unless I hold her and she does get very upset when my MIL holds her. My MIL is a lovely woman but you can't explain that to a baby. I have been trying to explain to MIL that I appreciate her help around the house a lot, feeding times, laundry (baby's clothes). I have been telling her that but when it comes to the baby crying her head off I'd appreciate if she let's me hold her. When I tell her that, especially when the baby is crying and clearly wants me to hold her, my MIL gets visibly upset. Close to crying even because she thinks I'm pushing her granddaughter away from her. \n\nThis mainly comes from her refusing to respect that I don't want her to kiss the baby on her lips, which is a disgusting habit my SIL also participates in. My MIL invites my SIL over as well to coo over the baby despite my daughter crying because of colic and overstimulation. She's not used to any of this. \n\nMy husband is not backing me up on this because of course it's his mother so now I have to talk to her without causing a rift.\n\nTl;dr MIL and SIL do not respect boundaries regarding my daughter of 6 weeks. If this continues I'd rather exclude them for a while. How can we fix this?",

            "Your problem isn't your MIL or SIL, it's your partner.  You need to sit him down and have this out with him.  He then needs to handle his family.",
            "> My husband is not backing me up on this because of course it's his mother so now I have to talk to her without causing a rift.\n\nThe issue here isn't your MIL. It's your husband and his unwillingness to set boundaries with his mom. Honestly, if you and your husband can't get on the same page with how to deal with his mom, she will always get in the middle of your family. \n\nHas he always had issues setting boundaries with his mom? It honestly may be time for couples counseling. Why are you with a person who can't prioritize you and the family he is building with you?",
            ">My husband is not backing me up on this because of course it's his mother so now I have to talk to her without causing a rift.\n\nHuh? No. Now, you have to talk to your husband, and HE has to talk to his MIL. \n\nIf he *still* won't get on board? Since you're the one home, tell her you don't want her for overnights for a while (read: ever). When she wants to come over for an afternoon, say no to some visits. You may not have just given birth, but colic can make anyone hormonal. ;-P You and Baby need to get into a nice schedule, and guess who doesn't dictate it? MIL. She sounds nice and all, but this is your baby. \n\nAnd I'd wear your baby around during their visits. Like, MIL gets some cuddles or does a feeding--scoop! Baby goes right into the carrier/Bjorn. And MIL does some laundry.",
            "If your husband isn't able to understand/and or do the work to have a conversation with her... You aren't left with many options besides doing it yourself. \n\nPerhaps sit her down and tell her that bonding with your daughter is incredibly important to you. Sandwich this comment with how much help she is offering, and that you appreciate all of her hard work around the house. \n\nSometimes you need to be really direct in your statements to get the point across. Reiterate that holding your daughter and bonding with her is very important. Period. \n\nAs for kissing on the lips, explain that your baby's immune system is nonexistent, and that you don't feel comfortable with spreading germs. Or you can be more blunt! Whichever approach works best. \n\nTruly, your husband should be doing this. I also had a clingy, passive-aggressive MIL. My husband didn't see the problem. I had to sit him down, and say that I am not asking, this is a requirement. (I don't ever make demands- so the gravity of what I saying finally drove home how I felt about the situation. Btw, I also had problems with her holding the baby, trying to feed the baby formula (when I was still breastfeeding), monopolizing my husband's time. Eventually, we had to ask her to leave because she failed to respect our decisions. \n\nI asked my husband not long ago- when our son was almost one- what he remembers about that time. He said something rather enlightening. He said that those first few months were a fog, that the stress of supporting the family and never having a break (first going to work and then coming home to help out with the baby so that I could shower), just about drove him to the breaking point. He was eventually diagnosed with PPD (did you know that 1 in 10 men also get PPD? Thankfully, this fact was shared with us in the hospital), and was on medication for about 3 months. He also didn't really see the issues that I was having with his mother, because he was always working or caring for the baby. \n\nI wanted to offer you this insight, because it may be helpful to you and how you approach your partner.",

            ">My husband is not backing me up on this because of course it's his mother \n\nThis comes up soooooo often on r/JUSTNOMIL. The husband is so accustomed to being a \"good son\" and letting MIL run the show, that it doesn't seem to compute when that comes into conflict with being a good father, or being a good husband. (To be fair it can definitely happen with daughters of overbearing mothers as well, but that isn't the scenario here.) And unfortunately when you have a MIL with baby rabies that often brings the three roles into sharp conflict. \n\nYour husband needs to realize that he is a father first, and that it is his job to prioritize his baby's **needs** over his mother's emotional **wants**. If your husband trusted you enough to have a child with you, he needs to trust you to advocate for that child even when it means he might need to have a difficult conversation with his mother.",
            "Okay. Having any guest sleep over when you have a newborn is just not convenient. Unless this woman is doing all your laundry, prepping meals, cleaning and tidying like it\u2019s her full time job, *It is not actually helpful*. \n\nYou need to take this to your partner. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been 6 weeks. Your mom has been so helpful. Going forward we will need less help, which means having an overnight guest, even if it\u2019s family, adds stress. Let\u2019s scale back on those types of visits, so that when we have your mom and sister over, we can just be a family and spend time with baby. Right now, it\u2019s so constant that baby ends up overstimulated, leading to hurt feelings and resentment. The sooner we can get back on track the better; not because I don\u2019t want her help but because we all share a better dynamic if she can just be grandma, who visits; as opposed to grandma who is a long term houseguest\u201d. It\u2019s in his mom\u2019s best interests to have that bit of distance with baby; part of the joy of a grandparent relationship is that novelty: you don\u2019t see them all the time so you capitalize on time with them and light up when they come. If mom is always there, and has held her when she didn\u2019t want her to hold her, that hurts their relationship. \n\nBasically: when it\u2019s your parent it\u2019s your problem. This is on him. He\u2019s not home throughout the day? Great! So he isn\u2019t witnessing the dynamic here. You want to remind him that this is in everyone\u2019s best interests, or there is a real risk of resentment and that\u2019s a much harder conversation to have than \u201chey mom we so appreciate your help. Going forward we won\u2019t need those overnight visits so regularly but we still want to see you lots! We can\u2019t thank you enough for being there when we needed you\u201d (past tense!). Remember that post-partum can strike either of you in these 2 years. Having a baby is hard and weird; boundaries are important. \n\nIs your partner usually so willing to let you be uncomfortable in favor of his family or friends?",
            "Yeah definitely right about it being your partner who needs to set the boundaries with his family. They will only resent you if you do it.\n\nI also agree with you about kissing children on the lips I know it is completly non sexual and a show of affection but this is how you pass herpes onto children. I also do not like people sucking their babies dummies etc to clean them.",
            "If you're approaching differences like they're \"a disgusting habit\" then you're going to hurt and alienate your in-laws, and you're going to engender resistance rather than cooperation. You guys do need to set boundaries, but those boundaries need to be agreed upon between the two of you, then communicated to your in-laws. So the first step is actually talk to your husband about what boundaries you need. Tell him you need his help and support in backing you up, but you also need to take his opinions into account \n\nSet boundaries firmly, but try to set them positively, too.  \"Please kiss her on the top of her head or her cheek,\" will meet with less resistance than \"don't kiss her on the lips.\" You may need to change to more negative wording, but save it for if an escalation is necessary. \"I need your help with this while I calm her down,\" may come across better than \"She wants me.\"\n\nAlso keep in mind, though, that it's actually really good for people besides you to soothe your daughter, even if it takes longer at first. It's good for your daughter to accept more than one caregiver and it's good for you to be able to have an actual break. The process can be anxiety provoking at first, but it really is a good thing.",
            ">I'd appreciate if she let's me hold her.\n\nYou are being way too passive here. Go get the baby yourself when the baby cries. If MIL is already holding the baby, demand she give the baby to you. If she refuses, say \"listen to yourself. You are preventing the baby's own father from holding her. You are being ridiculous. This is my house, my baby, give me the baby and then we can talk.\" Be authoritative and firm. \n\n>when the baby is crying and clearly wants me to hold her, my MIL gets visibly upset. Close to crying even because she thinks I'm pushing her granddaughter away from her.\n\nLet her be upset but don't let her hold the baby at all. If she's upset that's her problem. If her teary face makes you upset too, then tell her to leave the room and/or you leave the room and go to a different room, close the door. \n\n>This mainly comes from her refusing to respect that I don't want her to kiss the baby on her lips, which is a disgusting habit my SIL also participates in. My MIL invites my SIL over as well to coo over the baby despite my daughter crying because of colic and overstimulation. She's not used to any of this.\n\nIt's your house, right? If you don't want SIL over, then don't let her in. Meet her at the door and tell her that you know she loves the baby, but the baby is napping (or trying to nap) and you are not accepting visitors. But that you would love for her to come over on Thursday (insert whatever day you're comfortable with here). \n\nMake it very clear to MIL and SIL that your baby only takes visitors during certain hours of certain days (that are convenient for you). You love that they love your baby but they are interrupting your time with your own daughter and making your life harder. Keep your daughter in a separate area of the house and stay there with her. MIL can help cook for you in the kitchen for example, but the baby won't be in the kitchen. Stay close to your daughter when MIL is home, so you're the nearest one to attend to her when she cries.  \n\nMIL and SIL already don't respect you (or your husband) and just want to act how they want. There is no reasoning with them because you've already asked nicely and timidly and they just steamrolled right over you. So, be authoritative. Set up house rules and baby visiting rules. Enforce the rules. Don't argue with them, just tell them this is how it's going to be. \n\nThey're not going to like it, but they don't have to like it, they just have to obey your wishes.",

            "Just want to add some perspective as I\u2019m seeing a lot of \u201cyou need to talk to your husband\u201d comments.\n\nMy wife is awesome. We have a great marriage. We respect the hell out of each other. We have great communication. It\u2019s the easiest relationship I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nHer parents are her kryptonite. It\u2019s our only big fight. She always sides with them because she doesn\u2019t see them as people who can change or that will understand the boundaries I need (because we\u2019ve tried enforcing them in the past and they sort of get it half right and you would literally need to handhold them to get them across the finish line).\n\nAnyway - we just had our first kid, she\u2019s 3 months old and the in-laws stayed in town for 4 months. About 6 weeks leading up and 12 after she was born. They came over a few hours three times a week. For me, it became more of a chore handling in-laws than it was handling my child.\n\nMy wife and I are pretty self-aware and sensitive to our surroundings and are pretty in tune with our child\u2019s needs. Watching the grandparents try and console the kiddo with attention and holding her when really she just needed a bottle was always a little frustrating. Because we know our child\u2019s full rhythm and what need is coming next, so we want full control to meet those needs.\n\nI will also say, a lot of friends pretty much encouraged me to chill out and try to find some peace in the chaos. My instincts were to shut everyone out if they didn\u2019t play by my rules. I would still like to do that and didn\u2019t gain a lot by letting others dictate a little, but the time has officially passed and it\u2019s just the wife, myself and the babe now going forward.\n\nI say all that to offer support and say, even if you\u2019re awesome and your partner is awesome and your baby is awesome ... family throws a wrench in those gears.\n\nSo I\u2019ll try and offer some ideas inspired by some of my circumstances and see if we get you anywhere.\n\n1.) Stay in your room with the door closed. This is your safe space. You don\u2019t owe anyone your time or company. If you need your room, take the baby and just camp out. Do it all day for all I care. People are worried about their feelings being hurt, they\u2019re grown ups. They can learn to deal with their emotions and if your husband wants a certain grandparent relationship then set boundaries with him that he can navigate what that looks like when he\u2019s home from work and has time to facilitate grandma and aunt time.\n\n2.) Make the help errands. If they really want to help, send them out to get you lunch. Buy diapers and formula. Run the dishwasher. Even get specific, just put a list together of chores like swifter the kitchen, bleach down kitchen counters, take out the garbage. Just make a list and then put it out there as an offer. You might be surprised that they\u2019re happy to help with those things, or at the very least you will be validated when they throw a fit that they don\u2019t actually want to help, they just want to hold the baby.\n\n3.) Take advantage of the company with a date night. Just an hour out the house. It\u2019s sort of disorganized and not essential, but it does a few things. It gets you used to the baby not being in your presence 24/7. It recreates your marriage dynamic where it\u2019s just the two of you as a team, not the two of you facilitating the rest of your families feelings. And you\u2019ll probably enjoy it which will help you feel less resentment to the family staying with you.\n\n4.) Be pissed off and know that it\u2019s not forever. Don\u2019t feel guilt or shame for being frustrated. Don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re overreacting. Trust your instincts, your not being over protective. I think grandparents and family sort of turn your child into a toy or object of their affection and lose all aspects of awareness that this is another human that you\u2019re trying to care for. They have their own interests in mind and it\u2019s hidden under the mask of \u201cbeing helpful\u201d. You can be understanding that they\u2019re having a hard time understanding your needs and attempt to not feel resentment towards them, but don\u2019t feel like you owe anyone something just because their feelings are hurt.\n\n5.) Just keep being creative. If the day is just creating stress and anxiety ... you lost that day. It\u2019s just ... it\u2019s a day that sucked. But maybe the next time a day starts, you\u2019ll sort of know how to handle it better as you learn in your new experience. Maybe you don\u2019t like that they try and take over baby duty during meals or at certain times of the day. Maybe at that time of day, you go on a walk, or take the baby to the grocery store to \u201ctry it out\u201d. Just keep shaking up the routine so you can have a little control over it.\n\nAlright, these are just spit balling ideas. I\u2019m a big anxiety/depression person and having a kid destroyed a lot of the boundaries I established because now I owe my baby to everyone. It\u2019s really hard and needs a new learning curve, but things are good now and going forward. So there\u2019s potentially light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nAlso, anytime a family member moves into the house ... it spells trouble. Take this as a frustrating experience and start planning our boundaries with your spouse for the next trip or visit from family so you can start to feel like you\u2019ll have more control over your environment in the future opposed to building long lasting traditions that make you uncomfortable.",
            "Firstly, when you have a new baby and people offer to help you, they should be doing the things you need them to do, not just playing with the baby. \n\nWhen you tell someone not to do something in regards to your kid, like kissing them on the lips, and they refuse to comply, that's grounds for getting kicked the fuck out until they learn to be respectful of someones wishes for their own child. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour partner needs to have your back.

It doesn't matter that he thinks you should be grateful for the hlep. (Note: hlep might look like help, but it's not.)  If your MIL helped, instead of hleping, maybe you would be.  Tell him that YOU and his daughter need to be his priorities, and that he needs to stop putting his mommy's feeling above his husband's feelings, and his daughter's health and safety.   Really, he should be having this chat with him mom and sister, and dealing with all the boundary setting and enforcing when it comes to his family. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf my husband told me it was my responsibility to deal with his mom, he would regret those words...because he would NOT like the way I choose to deal with her.

            "Not the main point, but your mother in law and anyone else should avoid kissing your daughter on the lips because they can pass on herpes virus this way.  Even if they have no recollection of ever having a cold sore, they can shed virus without any symptoms and infants are especially susceptible to severe manifestations of the herpes virus. It\u2019s super rare, but when it does happen it can be life threatening for the infant.

However, their intentions aren't matching up with reality, and reality is what matters here.\n* What YOU, as the primary daytime caregiver needs, is minimal stress, so that you can provide the best possible care to your daughter.\n* While it would be great to find a situation where your MIL/in-laws just listen to you and actually provide the assistance you need, that's not going to happen without a LOT of stress on your part. You don't need more stress.\n* I'd give your husband two options - either he explains to his mom that she needs to back off while you're parenting unless you specifically ask for assistance, or his mom needs to stop coming over while he's at work.

            "Maybe say you got it now and thank MIL for the time she's been there? I know 6 weeks things are still pretty miserable and you could probably still use some help, But maybe it's time for another friend/Family to come over since MIL won't get the hint to back off",
            "Everyone needs to go home and leave you guys alone. Your husband needs to put his foot down and tell them while they are appreciated, your daughter is having an adjustment period and not doing well with all the stimulation.

            "My opinion is a little different from most of the ones I read. Take it as you will. As a couple, you won\u2019t always agree on things, and the same holds true in your role as parents. Is your husband willing to support you even if he doesn\u2019t agree? (I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve shared the reasons you don\u2019t want the other family members kissing baby on the lips, but perhaps I shouldn\u2019t assume that).  If he\u2019s not willing to support you, there\u2019s your issue and that\u2019s what needs to be dealt with.  If he does support you but doesn\u2019t want the conflict, then handle the conversation with the in laws instead of making him do it. I believe in being direct and think it\u2019s more fair for you to not put him in the middle. If this is between you and MIL, then handle it between the two of you, like adults.",
            "I remember feeling like this after my first child.  After the second one,  you realize that the baby will be fine and you should just go take a nap,  get your nails done,  make a nice supper,  workout.... or anything else that being a parent makes it hard to do. Good luck dealing with this and my only advice is to try and not burn bridges.    It would be a shame if the reason you alienate the grandma is that she \"kisses on the lips\".",
            "Your husband needs to stand up for you or else this behavior will continue. It also sounds like sitting down for a family meeting could be helpful. Reiterating that the baby is colicky and you\u2019re not trying to keep the baby to yourself is a good start. Thanking them for their help but also reminding them that they need to follow your rules because it\u2019s still your house and your baby. I also have a husband who doesn\u2019t want to tell his family anything but if he doesn\u2019t stand up for you they will figure it\u2019s ok because your husband isn\u2019t saying anything. New babies can really complicate family situations so it sounds like starting with getting support and then having some open communication with everyone would be your best bet. Good luck",
            "I'm so sorry you gotta experience this. It's so frustrating and upsetting when family refuse to respect your wishes. My brother was like your husband. My SIL expressed to him about not wanting his mom to kiss her baby on the lips (especially because she has cold sores) and to stop trying to hold her kid because the kid wants her not his mom.\n\nIt is best to talk to your husband because if your husband doesnt have your back, que the mom telling your husband how you dont like her or some shit. And your husband needs to understand the concerns you have whether he wants to or not. Kissing on the lip is unhygienic. Insisting she holds the baby as the baby cries is frustrating for you AND your daughter. Clearly your husband refuses to set boundaries with his mom and the SIL. \n\nIf you address it, there will be a rift no matter what. And your MIL might even try to get your husband to talk to YOU about \"overreacting\"which you are not. I think going \"MIL, I appreciate the extra hands around the house. You've been helpful with the chores around the house that gives me more time to focus on my baby. I understand you want to help more but you're definitely doing a lot already which I'm grateful for. As much as you help out, I do want you to leave taking care of my baby to me when she's crying a lot. I know you want to help console her, I appreciate your efforts to but i know what to do when she cries and what helps soothes her\" or something like that. She'll still he offended considering she already got offended by the lip kissing. Maybe phrasing it as her being so helpful before telling you to stop might make the pill a little bit easier to swallow.\n\nIn my brother's case, he didnt feel comfortable addressing the issue at all until my SIL basically snapped at his mom. And his mom was trying to play the \"I'm just trying to help, idk why she doesnt like me. I just wanna be there for the baby\". Like if she was holding the baby's intention at heart then she obviously would be listening to your concerns and respecting it. After the whole blow up, he finally addressed it but it was too late by then because my SIL had enough.  Now with his 2nd kid, he's more active in understanding my SIL concerns so the blow up doesnt repeat itself. So yeah, talk with your husband again and if he refuses, let him know you will do it because your child safety and health comes before his mom and SIL feelings. \n\nI wish you more support in your experience. I tried supporting my SIL by actively calling out the elders in my family when they try to do what your MIL does. Like saying \"stop holding her, she doesnt want you. Give her back to the mom\" which helped my SIL not have to deal with the awkwardness of confronting more people.\n\nEdit: a word",
            "Is it possible your husband isn't backing you up because he doesn't agree with you?\n\nBabies get colic, and they cry a *lot*. Especially at six weeks, what your kid is doing is not out of the ordinary in any sense. \n\nIt sounds like a lot of this is your personal hang ups, and maybe some territory issues between you & your husband's family. \n\nI agree that the kissing on the lips thing is weird, but you should be articulating this to your husband, and *he* should be talking about it with his family, talking about the health concerns until your kid's immune system gets stronger.",

What you need to do is be a papa bear and do what's best for the baby.  If that means hurting MIL's feelings then so be it.  \n\nYou and your husband need to be a united front.  Enlist your pediatrician in explaining to you husband how MIL and SIL are putting your child at risk of all sorts of horrible stuff.  Your DH needs to grow a backbone and learn to stand up to his mother.   His #1 relationship job right now is to be a good dad and husband, not worrying about being a good son.   \n\nAlso, tell  your DH that help isn't help if it isn't wanted.  Maybe next time he's doing something, barge in and make a mess of it.  When he gets mad exclaim that you were just helping and he should be happy.  Then later point out that's how you feel about MIL trying to take over parenting duties.  \n\nAlso take a break from having MIL over so much.  She's acting like she's a third parent/mom to the baby.  Nope - baby already has two parents.  MIL is extended family and needs to back off.  \n\nYou need to establish firm boundaries and consequences for breaking them, then follow thru with the consequences.  It might get ugly, but you and DH are the parents and baby needs to bond with you guys, not MIL.  MIL needs to go home and stay there.",

No. MIL will push back, make a big deal, escalate the emotion, guilt you, whatever.

It would be wise if he was made aware of how grave this situation is, and that a rift in your marriage is what this is causing.\n\nNo other solution is possible here, I'm sorry.

            "Your husband is seriously failing you right now. It is very difficult to be a stay at home parent, especially with a high needs infant. He is, at best, ignorantly assuming what you need/want while you are home all day with a screaming baby. At worst, he is blatantly ignoring what you need/want because he doesn't want to deal with his mommy. In either case, this an issue with your partner that you need to resolve asap. \n\nTell him that you desperately need him to help you, to back you up, to be on your team, and to listen to what you actually need right now. Then lay down some very concrete boundaries that he needs to convey to his mother. It's up to YOU to figure out what those are. Do you need a complete break from mil for a few weeks? Do you need to allow visits only when your husband is home? Do you want her to come over for a few hours once a week? Remember that she is not entitled to your time, your home, or your baby.\n\nIt's not difficult for your husband to tell his mom \"Hey we really appreciate all your help so far. For now, we're going to hunker down as a family for a few weeks to get through this colic stage. We'll let you know when we're up for company again.\"",
            "Hey, congrats on your baby! That's exciting! That being said, I think it's okay to sit down with your MIL and explain what \"attachment bonding\" is. Your baby knows YOU. Your baby loves YOU most. Your baby needs YOU for comfort. That is how babies work. You have every right to want to hold her when she's upset, because that's how bonding works, and it's a crucial process between caregiver and child. She went through this process with her own children. It's possible that she just wants to go through it again. Totally normal to want to snuggle the hell out of a baby. Just not okay right now because you have a sick, fussy baby in need of comfort. \n\nIt's your house, man, and your baby. She needs to respect boundaries or leave. That includes not kissing your colicky, newborn baby on the lips. Your husband may or may not back you up, but this won't be the first or last time you'll need to lay down the law regarding how people treat you or your baby girl. I have the sweetest dog in the world, and she loves babies, but my sister didn't want my dog near her newborn, and that was fine by me because it's important that she know I respect her decisions as a mama. That's a level of respect you deserve, too, as a new papa.  \n\nJust FYI, though, colicky babies can be pretty traumatic for the parents. We are trained to respond to crying babies AS SOON AS FREAKING POSSIBLE and not being able to fix the problem for the baby can be very stressful. Take care of yourself, manage your stress, and if you need a break, take one - a colicky baby will likely be as fussy today as it was tomorrow, until one day, for no fucking reason that any of us can discern, it gets magically better. \n\nGood luck!",

I myself did it but as a mother I thought nothing of it. It's my child and a baby I adore. That's just how I saw it and plus I was the mother. I didn't like anyone else doing that though and as they got older I didn't do it. Anyone who sexualizes a peck kiss to a child is the perv though. But if it makes you uncomfortable that's understandable and it's your right to tell them not to kiss your child on the lips. Your situation sounds stressful enough being new dad's and the added in law stress isn't helping.

She also says all people around the baby must have their whooping cough booster vaccinations.

It is not meant to interfere with her bond to you as she gets older.  Please don't feel offended, but this is necessary.  \n\nAt a later time, tell her you consulted the pediatrician about the colic, and she gave you instructions on helping the baby calm down.  It's important for you, her primary caregiver, to be the one calming the baby.   Thank her sincerely for her help, but don't get dragged into a debate about it. If she takes offense, rock the classic \"I'm sorry you feel that way, the last thing I want is to offend you. But I need to do this myself.  I'm sure you can understand that.\"\n\nThen do things that include her in, like posting pics with grandma and baby on social media, giving her kudos.  Ask her about what her son was like as a baby.

            "Sometimes you can not solve problems like this without a rift. You do not have control over anyone else\u2019s feelings. \n\nYour partner needs to back you up. This is the real issue. Maybe you take a day off or two while he is there with his mom. Allow him to experience what\u2019s going on. \n\nKissing babies on the mouth is an issue due to germs and bacteria. Your newborn has no immune system and can\u2019t handle what\u2019s in another persons mouth. MIL needs to be reassured she will have a relationship with her grandkid and right now is not the time to bond with people outside main care takers. She has literal years to do this as your child ages. Consider giving directive answers to correct her behavior. \u201cwe kiss on top of the head, thank you!\u201d \u201cWhen she is crying like I wear her in the carrier please hand her over.\u201d \u201cWe have guests over in the mornings only when we are all fresh and calm for right now.\u201d",

            "maybe you will find my own story useful.\n\nmy MIL came to live with us to help with the newborn. turns out, she's horrible at it and was actually hurting our son's development. my wife finally agreed MIL needed to leave so we sent her back. it's been half a year but i think my wife is still harboring resentment towards me that is getting worse. like, she cannot accept that her mom was such a bad caretaker and instead blames me for driving a rift between her and her parents, even though at the worst point (when we sent MIL back), she agreed that it was best for the baby and for us.\n\nso that's what i'm currently dealing with. and my wife refuses counseling, whether it's for herself or marriage counseling.",
            "New babies are a very exciting but also a very draining and stressful time for families. Most of all for you, her parents, but also for grandparents - especially if it is a first grandchild. It sounds like your mother in law is well-intentioned but you're having trouble communicating your needs and boundaries to her effectively. If your husband refuses to speak with her one on one, insist that he join you for a conversation with her, and explain to him that your mother in law will probably be LESS hurt and rejected hearing it explained by her son than her son-in-law.   \n\n\nOn a practical level, it sounds like it's time for mother in law to go home. Once she's home, or maybe before she leaves, plan a visit when she can come over and have uninterrupted time with the baby, holding her and cooing and generally showering her with love. Even if baby is crying, let grandma have her time with baby - baby will be okay crying for a few minutes. If you think you can offer grandma some pointers to help her soothe baby, that might be helpful, or perhaps suggesting a book she can read to help her learn soothing techniques, like Happiest Baby On the Block.   \n\n\nFinally, you mentioned a \"disgusting\" habit of grandma kissing baby on the mouth. Although I can understand why you might find this unsavory, it's quite common in many families and cultures. If you can, I suggest letting that one go; if it is a real concern for you in terms of spreading germs or you just can't stomach it, I would be very careful in explaining to her that you don't want her to do that, offer her an alternative (eskimo kisses? kissing baby's face?) and do not bring it up in the same conversation as the issues with grandma soothing baby or grandma moving home.   \n\n\nAbove all else - try to be patient with yourself and with her. This is a hard time, and tempers run thin; but if she is generally a supportive and loving mother in law and grandmother, remind yourself that this difficult time will soon be behind you as baby becomes more settled. The wonderful relationship that can exist between grandparents and grandchildren is certainly worth the effort of keeping things civil now.",
            "Do not let people kiss your baby on the lips. Many adults have cold sores (herpes) and this is exactly how babies get it.",
            "If you have a problem with a grandmother kissing her granddaughter on the lips, then I would politely suggest that you have a problem with boundaries, not her.",
            "I didn't see anyone bring this up, so OP please know that this gross habit can give your baby cavities! Babies are not born with cavity-causing bacteria and they have to pick them up from an adult! Totally reasonable to defend your boundaries here.",
            "I really hate when people don\u2019t listen to parents\u2019s worries and needs. You need to speak up more. And tell them straight forward that \u201c no kissing my baby on the mouth, you can on her cheeks but that\u2019s it\u201d and also when the child is crying \u201cgive her to me \u201c!!!! Point blank and make sure every word is said perfectly.",
            "It's poor hygiene for a baby with little to no immune system \n\nList some things you are happy for help with but that you will handle the crying  situations.  \nThat it's not you stomping on her feelings it's you wanting to comfort your daught you never get these precious hours back and absolutely no kissing on the lips this was advised by midwife or healthcare professional.",
            ">My husband is not backing me up on this because of course it's his mother \n\nThis comes up soooooo often on r/JUSTNOMIL. The husband is so accustomed to being a \"good son\" and letting MIL run the show, that it doesn't seem to compute when that comes into conflict with being a good father, or being a good husband. (It can definitely happen with daughters of overbearing mothers as well, but that isn't the scenario here.) And unfortunately when you have a MIL with baby rabies that often brings the three roles into sharp conflict. \n\nYour husband needs to realize that he is a father first, and that it is his job to prioritize his baby's **needs** over his mother's emotional **wants**. If your husband trusted you enough to have a child with you, he needs to trust you to advocate for that child even when it means he might need to have a difficult conversation with his mother.",
            "In laws don\u2019t listen worth a fuck",

            "My dad kissed my niece on the lips at 2 years old. It looked like he was a pedifile. My family did a lot of kissing when we were young. It was terrible. We were isolated and I didn't kiss a girl till I was 20. \n\nIf the baby cries against your in laws something is very wrong with them. The baby knows. \n\nIf you're mother in law is actually living in the apartment, you've got to get her to change her attitude towards the baby. It's too bad that she's got her own idea of who the baby is. You might not get through to her. \n\nIn my experience babies can sense when a person has low self esteem or is feeling adult issues with themselves. Babies don't like that and cry or frown when they see it. We were born being able to read emotions. \n\nI wish you could have more independence. \n\nA counselor might help in this situation to help you and the mil express your situation in an overseen situation. Don't bring your husband but bring the baby. \n\nThat's what I think. \n\nIt looks like the mil cares more about her image as a gm rather than respecting your boundaries as the m and most important figure in that babies life. That's not the relationship gm is supposed to have with the baby. Especially if their kissing it too much. Stimulation is bad for babies I think too. They need calm cause their learning and trying to make sense of what is night and what is day.\n\nTell your husband he is more your husband than his mother's son.",
            "I think calling kissing babies on the lips within your own family a \"disgusting habit\" is overreacting. It's totally understandable to limit this if your MIL or SIL have any communicable diseases, but I don't see what the big deal is if that's not the case. It might make you cringe, but is it worth fighting over?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: turns out it's not good for babies. I had no idea! Share the info with your MIL and SIL!",
            "I went through this with my mil. She wanted to help by babysitting so I could clean or run errands. This stressed me out because I don\u2019t want to be away from my baby and my baby doesn\u2019t want to be away from me. I am perfectly capable of watching my baby, ordering groceries or takeout, and cooking or cleaning while baby naps. It also bugged me because she wouldn\u2019t just say she wanted visits with baby, which I would have accommodated, but insisted on acting like it was helpful to insist on being in my space all the time. It wasn\u2019t! \n\nIt\u2019s only help if you want it, otherwise it\u2019s \u201chlep.\u201d Your mil and sil only want to feed their baby rabies and they\u2019re justifying it to themselves and your husband by calling it help. Explain to him how it makes you feel and how it affects your baby. Explain that their motives don\u2019t matter\u2014in other words, well intentioned or not, the fact is that their presence isn\u2019t helpful and it needs to be addressed. Your husband needs to set boundaries with them that you\u2019re comfortable with. Aim for a certain amount of visits per week or month at times that are convenient for you and baby and put a stop to the cohabitation and babysitting. As the primary caregiver I think it is fine to insist on a level of interaction that works for you. Your husband doesn\u2019t just get to decide that his mother gets to coparent with you because he\u2019s decided it\u2019s helpful. Good luck.",
            "Kissing a baby isn't a disgusting habit...",
            "I scrolled to see if anyone else had suggested it yet, but I don't see it so you should take this over to r/justnomil. They are lovely people and will be able to help you talk to your husband as well as set boundaries with your MIL in the future. Bottom line is though as others have said, you have a husband problem and you need to get him on board before you confront the MIL. Good luck, OP.",
            "Oh OP, I\u2019m sooo sorry. My second was colicky and it was... something. Possibly the worst 3 months of my life. I was in full-on survival mode, and has zero patience for any shit that didn\u2019t involve making sure my kids were adequately taken care of. I remember being so tired and out of it that if you asked me a question that I didn\u2019t already have an answer to, my brain would just freeze and I couldn\u2019t form an intelligent thought. Right now the focus needs to be on getting through the next couple of months without killing each other. Since you\u2019re the one at home and doing the bulk of baby care, making your life easier should be your partner\u2019s main concern, not making sure his family feels involved. Who cares if the laundry falls behind, if there are a few extra dishes in the sink. You have a newborn! It\u2019s normal for chores to take a backseat, it\u2019s all part of the adjustment period. I get the feeling that your partner might feel bad that he isn\u2019t able to share the load equally (which is normal in a dynamic where one spouse works), so his solution is to have his mother do his \u201chalf\u201d and then he feels like he\u2019s contributing. I\u2019m a SAHM. Would it be \u201chelpful\u201d for someone to come in and do all the laundry? Sure... in a matter of speaking. Personally I would rather do the laundry myself if it means not having someone in my feet, involving themselves in the way I choose to raise my kids. It may seem like I\u2019m \u201cjust at home anyway\u201d, so anyone should get to drop in whenever they like, but that\u2019s not the case. That\u2019s still MY time, and I get to decide how I want to spend it. And i definitely don\u2019t want to spend it entertaining my husband\u2019s family. Tell your partner that you want to figure it out on your own and that it\u2019s stressing you out to have them over all the time without him there. He can either tell them to back off, or you can tell them, but they\u2019ll probably take it better from him.",
            "Shit, cause that rift!",
            "You should Google \u201cBaby dies from Kiss\u201d and show that to your partner. I\u2019m not saying that your MIL or SIL have any communicable diseases but babies do not have the same immunities built up as an adult does so the mouth kisses should be a huge NO!",
            "You can have your family read this:\nI'm a first time mom to a now 16 month old who had awful colic. Had. She grew out of it. But during that time she was extra and in need of TLC. \nYou look at this child the same way you would a vunerable adult; they need you to care for them the way they need comfort- not how the other (grown) person wants to care for them. It's not their job to make you feel good about yourself, it's your (and their job) to meet that kid's needs. With colic, it's a special formula, end of story. Respecting that shows respect for that human, regardless of anything else. \n\nThe rift is okay, believe me. My MIL can say whatever about me and who ever is dumb enough to believe it was never going to see my side anyways. My job is to protect my child, and I know you're reaching out because you know it's your and your husband's job too. This is all said with love, and with the knowledge that you can do it.",

I get your her daddy and you feel like you know best but the truth if the matter is she doesn't know your her daddy, or that your husband is either at this age there eye sight is only just starting to be able to see in colour and still can only really see about 6 inches away from her face. I can understand how your mil will be filling if at the first sign of your daughter crying you step in. Plus your making a rid for your own back by doing this as it will get to t he stage where your mil withdraws her help altogether if you keep stepping in and taking your daughter away from her. I'm a qualified nursery nurse/early years practitioner and a mum of 4 and step mum of 2 so do have a lil insight into children n parenting. You sound an amazing attentive daddy and your daughter is lucky to have so many people in her life who love her and want to be part of her life. Give your mil time alone with your daughter even if you feel like your right arms been cut off without her being close, in the long run it helps for her to develop a strong bond with other adults so that she grows up a well round young lady with self confidence.\n\nI also don't agree with the kissing thing as well. You'll be surprised just how strong a 6 week old baby's immune system is even though we all think it's very poor plus I'm a great believe in if you protect your children from ever thing that can have germs/bacteria on you are actually stopping there immune system from developing as it's never had to fight off any. Plus give her time and everything she can get her hands on will end up in her mouth and you can't spend the rest of your life anti=bacing everything within an inch if it's life just in case it may have germs on. I'm guessing this precious little princess is your first child, please try and relax a little and enjoy these moments as all to soon she won't be a little baby any more.\n\nWhy don't you try one morning/afternoon a week leaving your daughter with her grandma and go and enjoy so you time. It will do everyone the world of good. Sorry if people don't like my opinion but I stand by it. Hope you get everything sorted out soon whichever advise you take x",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account because my boyfriend is an avid redditor. \n\nHe's a fashion photographer. Meaning he works alongside many beautiful women in his profession. Stylists, hair and makeup artists, and of course, *models*. \n\nThis is actually how we met. \n\nI modeled my way through college and he photographed me, after which we became friends and eventually started dating. We have been together now for almost three years. I've since stopped modeling, but he is still a photographer. Never once in our relationship has he given me any reason to question his fidelity. With the exception of me, he has never dated or even befriended any of the models he has photographed. \n\nThat was, until, Rachel came into the picture. \n\nI've met Rachel. She seems like a fun chick, the type of girl who draws a lot of positive attention just by entering a room. She's beautiful but her personality really shines through. She makes you feel like you're her best friend when you're talking to her. A very *cool* person through and through. \n\nThat said, I'm not the only one who feels this way. My boyfriend also adores Rachel. The first time he photographed her, he stayed late at the studio and discussed ideas for their next shoot for nearly three hours. He was actually late for a night out with me because of it, but he's always had terrible time management so I didn't think anything of it. \n\nThe lateness has now become a steady, recurring factor in their shoots together. They hang out long after the stylists and makeup artists leave the studio. \n\nThey also text a lot, and he's always smiling to himself and laughing when he reads the messages she sends him. At first he would show them to me and try to include me in on all the fun (without me asking) but he abruptly stopped doing that around two weeks ago. He tilts his phone away from me now when Rachel messages him. \n\nI'm not the jealous type but if my bf had a history of doing this with the other models, I'd let it slide. The fact that he is *only* like this with Rachel (and me, I suppose) makes me wary of what might have transpired between them. \n\nRachel herself has stopped talking to me. We used to communicate and have an easy, casual friendship via IG and Snap chat, but she pretty much ignores me now. Guilty conscience? I don't know. \n\nThe real kicker is, my boyfriend now has a photo of Rachel as the wallpaper on his phone. He's apparently proud of the concept and the editing, and claims it has nothing to do with Rachel herself, which is totally believable, but ... doesn't sit right with me. I told him that and he told me I was being irrational. \n\nRachel is single by the way. She and her bf broke up around three weeks ago, so you be the judge. \n\nI really don't want to fall into the jealous gf trope but what else am I to think? I don't want to make crazy demands and accuse my bf of cheating on me, even emotionally but he really does seem to be fond of this girl in a way that really hurts me. He has other female friends and he doesn't act that way with them. He's capable of being friendly with a girl without flirting or acting suspicious, but with Rachel it's different. \n\nHe has slowly become very attached to her and I feel like I'm losing him. I have expressed this to him a couple of times but he always tells me I have nothing to worry about and that he and Rachel are just \"kindred\" when it comes to photography. The long nights, constant texting, and phone wallpaper mean nothing. Oh btw, she's practically naked in the photo and it wasn't taken for any sort of publication; just for fun. \n\nAm I being irrational? Unreasonable? How would you feel in this situation? What would you do? \n\nTL;DR - photographer bf has been growing very close to one of his models and acting dismissive of my concerns regarding their work relationship. He has a practically naked photo of her as his phone wallpaper. Wtf am I supposed to think? \n\n**mini update:** He and I are meeting for lunch in an hour.\n\n**extra mini update:** He confessed. More on that later. \n\n**micro teacup update:** I'll give you guys the full story as soon as this post is kicked off the front page. Correct me if I'm wrong. I don't think we're allowed to post updates until the dust has settled on the original. \n\nIn any case, thank you so much for all the advice and overwhelming kindness. I'm kind of a mess right now but I'm lucky enough to have an amazing support system and a clear head. That's all I really wanted out of this unfortunate situation. \n\n\n**OFFICIAL UPDATE:** \n [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zo0cs/my_26f_boyfriend_28m_has_become_suspiciously/)\n\nFirst of all, I\u2019d like to thank everyone who left a comment on the original post. Your advice, your words of encouragement and support, and even your criticism has helped me immensely. Thanks. Really. \n\nSecond, I\u2019d like to address a few things: \n\n1. My boyfriend \u2014 sorry, ex boyfriend \u2014 has never taken nude or even partially nude photos of me. Although I modelled in high school and university, my primary focus has always been stage acting. He took my head shots. That\u2019s how we met. Not that it really changes anything. Just a bit of insight, I guess. \n\n2. When we were younger and when the relationship was newer, I would accompany him to his shoots all the time. But my own career is very time consuming nowadays. I know of multiple model/photographer relationships where they accompany each other to every shoot, and I\u2019ve nothing against doing that, but I personally would rather just trust that my SO is on their best behaviour. Obviously what happened here kind of squashes that \u2026 but I stand by it. If I have to be there in order to make sure my SO faithful, chances are they\u2019ll find other ways to cheat.\n\n3. I\u2019m flattered by the offers, but no, I will not be meeting anyone for drinks anywhere. Sorry for the bluntness, just \u2026 yeah.\n\nOkay, now for the good stuff! \u2026 or I guess, the bad stuff. \n\nI met him for lunch Friday afternoon. We went to our favourite sushi joint overlooking the ocean, and I ordered more than I could handle, stuffing my face while trying to decide how to broach the topic of Rachel, but most importantly, our relationship. I went into that meeting with a righteous, ass-kicking speech prepared, but I forgot every word of it almost immediately after we sat down. I guess he could tell there was something on my mind, because he asked me if I was alright, if he had done anything to upset me. *Snorts.* Yes, Ian, you\u2019ve upset me very much, actually. As soon as I gathered the confidence to look him in the eyes, I point blank asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on between you and Rachel?\u201d His mouth flew open as if he were completely and utterly taken aback by the implication, but I cut him off with, \u201cDO NOT bullshit me.\u201d \n\nI tried my best not to let anger get the best of me, I really did. I wanted to stay cool, calm, and collected like so many women on this sub. You know the ones. Those intense stories of cheating husbands wherein the wife takes to /r/relationships, garners a ton of support, and then updates us later with a well-constructed, storybook post detailing the evidence she has collected against him and the meeting she had with her Uncle or sibling, who just so happens to be a divorce lawyer \u2026 ? \n\nYeah, I\u2019m not a badass like that. I wish I were, but I\u2019m honestly just an overly emotional doormat and I knew going into this meeting that I was either going to cry or gouge his eyes out with my mind. Because I had somewhere to be later, I took a hard left and got super, SUPER angry.\n\nHe could see it in me, the anger bubbling over. The people in the restaurant were starting to stare at us, too. In order to save face I threw money on the table (with tip) and told him to meet me in the parking lot. If I\u2019d had a switchblade on me, I can\u2019t say for certain I wouldn\u2019t have channeled my inner Jet and beat his Shark ass to the pavement.\n\nKidding. Totally kidding.  \n\nWe met inside my car. He climbed in after me, his head down as though he were ashamed or \u2026 I don\u2019t know, GUILTY?!?!?!?!?!\n\nI asked him *how*, and he explained everything to me. No preamble whatsoever. \n\nThe moment he met Rachel he felt some type of way towards her. He couldn\u2019t tell whether it was just a silly crush or something more, but he knew she felt it, too. *How cuuuuuuute*. \n\n**BARF.**\n\nThey kissed the first night they met. The night he nearly stood me up. \n\nThey had CRAZY, **emotional**, *~forbidden* sex the night she and her boyfriend called it quits.\n\nAnd they\u2019ve been fucking ever since. \n\nHe mentioned he has always used a condom with her, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m getting tested. Oh and because so many people asked in the original post, I figure I should mention Rachel was the one who was broken up with in her previous relationship. I don\u2019t know why or how. I didn\u2019t ask and I don\u2019t care to know.\n\nFunnily enough, Ian said he doesn\u2019t want to be with Rachel, he wants to be with me, and he even provided text messages to show that he\u2019s the one who decided not to pursue anything with her on official grounds, but I told him I give zero fucks about what he wants. And unless he can go w/o his eyes, he should get the fuck out of my car and erase me from his mind before I erase him. \n\nI literally said that.  \n\nIn any case, I went home later that day, posted an update for you guys on the original, and drank. A lot. \n\nMy friends and family, and most of Ian\u2019s friends and family, have rallied around me in support. I guess he told his mother we broke up and how it happened, because she called me this morning and said she\u2019s disgusted with her son and that if I need anything at all, she\u2019s always there for me. \n\nFor real, you guys, I\u2019m going to miss his family. They\u2019re good people. The best people. \n\nThis is my first \u201cadult\u201d breakup, by the way. The type of breakup where you\u2019re required not only to break up with your SO but with their family and friends, as well. These people you\u2019ve spent so much time getting to know and growing to love, are suddenly not in your life anymore and it\u2019s \u2026 well, it\u2019s kind of daunting, really. Daunting and sad and infuriating all at the same time.\n\nSo, that\u2019s the conclusion to this story. That\u2019s what happened. \n\nThank you again to everyone. \n\nIf I have anything to add, I\u2019ll do so below.\n\nTL;DR - he admitted to cheating with Rachel and then I dumped his ass.\n\n**note:** To the person who said violence is never the answer and I should never have threatened my ex - *You're right, you are absolutely right, but if you're ever in a situation where your lying, cheating ex refuses to leave your car the first dozen times you asked, I dare you not to lose your shit and say things you don't mean just so he gets the fuck out (and doesn't see you cry).* \n\n**microscopic update:** So far, his mother, his teenaged step-brother, and two male friends of his, have reached out to me saying how disgusted, ashamed and embarrassed they are on his behalf. On top of three mutual friends. It hasn't been two days yet, you guys. \n",

Would you be okay with this being the way he behaves when you have concerns about his behavior with another woman? What does that say to you about him?

A few months into the relationship she started hanging out with a group of guy friends from high school.  \nShe was happy to finally have friends in this town and started spending a lot of time at (we'll call him Gary)'s house. I couldn't go there because they have three cats and I'm allergic.  \nSlowly she started spending more time with them and less time with me until eventually I barely saw her. I confronted her about it several times and every time she assured me it was completely platonic and I had nothing to worry about.  \nThen a party happened that I only heard stories about.  \nEver since that party everything changed, her fb profile pic was her and \"Gary\", her phone background changed from us kissing to her and her new friends and she spent all her free time over there.  \nTwo weeks later we were broken up and she told me a sob story about her undiagnosed PTSD and that she isn't emotionally able to date anyone.  \nOne week later and she's now dating \"Gary\".  \n**TL;DR: Time priorities and display pictures matter.**",

            "You know, there's always posts like these. In my opinion, it never matters if your bf has cheated or not because you can feel his attraction to her and his growing tension and distancing with you. I'm so sorry this is happening to your relationship. You said he was fond of her in a way that hurts you and I think when that is true it never matters what cheating has happened or not. You are feeling saddened by his split attention and it's not ok to feel anything but #1 in a relationship. Your examples of him being late meeting you because he's spending extra time with her, and the sudden secrecy when they text demonstate his priority. It's really stupid that your boyfriend doesn't have the self awareness or respect for you to remove himself from this person. Because that is what loyal, respectful and responsible partners do when they have a crush outside their relationship. \n\nFor me, if he can't see what is wrong with this scenario that would translate to a direct incompatibility. However, you could always give him the chance to see what you are seeing and either limit contact with her (no more staying after the photoshoot or being alone with her at all, no more texting her when you two are together, whatever other boundaries you feel comfortable with etc) or completely cut her off (I think this is the only real solution if you stay together btw because of their current enmeshment). I think you've tried already though. I would just let this relationship go and find a more mature partner that isn't so reckless with your heart.",

She refuses, saying \"The Lord will provide.\"\n\nAn hour or so later, with the water level still rising, a larger motor boat with several passengers (some of which have been rescued from their homes) comes by and calls over to the woman, asking if she'd like to get on. She refuses, saying \"The Lord will provide.\"\n\nAnother hour passes and the water level continues to rise and, as luck would have it, another, larger boat, carrying many rescued passengers and looking for more comes by and hails the woman to get on. Again she refuses, saying \"The Lord will provide.\"\n\nThe water keeps rising, no more boats show up and the woman drowns. She ascends to heaven and the lord himself is there to meet her at the pearly gates. \"My lord,\" says the old woman, \"I've always been deeply religious, i've lived my life piously and virtuously! Why oh why did you allow me to drown?\"\n\nGod is exasperated: \"Lady, I sent three boats!\"\n\nMy point is: how many more signs do you need, woman?

I've had conversations with women on Facebook and text before, and not one of them would I hesitate to show the wife if she felt insecure about them.

I'd better start hiding them\", so he started tilting his phone away. Hell, it could have even been unconscious. But either way, he did it. Something happened that made him realize that you couldn't see the texts. \n\nMaybe they're talking about fucking each other. Maybe they're talking about a deep, strong emotional bond they've discovered. Maybe they're talking about how flat her ass looked in one of the shoots from last week. \n\nEither way, they're talking about something that he's decided you can't see.

I can't imagine saying *anything* but \"I didn't know you felt that way; I enjoy having a close friendship with this person but it's important to me to try to create a situation that you're comfortable with.\" At MINIMUM, I'd say \"I don't think your request is reasonable,\" and then offer an alternative or negotiation, **never** just shut them out.\n\nSorry, OP, but my assessment is that your boyfriend's either a garbage communicator or something's not on the up and up.

Or from the ex himself? He may know something that is being kept from you, so if there's a way to find out (without starting super drama that you know you can't handle) then it's worth thinking about. \n\nIf your SO is protective of his phone then there's probably info on there that could clarify just how bad this is, too. But personally, I couldn't deal with this level of disrespect even if they aren't sleeping together. He's putting her ahead of you in multiple ways that you can already observe. \n\nIf you asked him to keep their communication only professional and not to spend time together outside of when all the staff are on site (essentially, end the \"friendship\" and spend no time alone together) would he agree to that in order to make you feel more secure? Or would he call you crazy?\n\nIf you showed up to one of their shoots, either during the shoot or after when they are usually alone, what kind of reception might you get?\nReally, at this point it might be time to show up during that alone time and see what they're doing.

I think it's fair that you sit down with him and ask him what is going on. That you've never been jealous before but also that he's never acted this way before. If he dismisses you again, that in itself is a concern as this is not normal behavior for you either and he should realize that this is not a small issue for you and therefore requires some effort on his part work this out with you.",

WTF, just *what???*\n\nThat is some hard gas lighting. \n\nI think he wants the comfort of his relationship with you or wants you as his safety net while he has his fun with Rachel.

Then you find out she broke up with her bf shortly before your bf got shifty?\n\nThere are too many red flags here, and if he won't see your point of view about this, you have some decisions to make.  \n\nPlease don't let him use yours and his backgrounds in the arts to wave away all of the shifty shit he's up to.  You can be a photographer without blowing off dates with your SO to hang out with a \"kindred\" spirit.  He crossed the professional line, here.",

However, I don't think it's a level of closeness I would be comfortable with anyway, and could easily be that they haven't done anything but are developing feelings for each other. Honestly, either way, something needs to change.\n\n(Obviously if he has actually already cheated on you, then you should dump his ass, etc.)\n\nSorry this isn't more helpful.

Don't necessarily accuse him of anything (unless you think you've got enough evidence). Instead tell him (again) how his relationship with Rachel makes you feel, especially as of late. Explain to him why it bothers you and ask him if he's having second thoughts about you alls relationship. Ask him to be honest. Even if it hurts. Based on his answers ou be the judge on whether or not he's being honest. ",
            "You are not being irrational. He's just slowly eased into these new behaviors so you got acclimated to each new little thing. When you look at the bigger picture it's pretty obvious that he's likely cheating with her. Of course there is certainly a possibility that he's not, but either way he's definitely, 100% overstepped the bounds of what's acceptable with friends when in a relationship. You definitely have the right to ask him to tone things down, i.e the sexy pic of her he has on his phone.\n\nHonestly, the picture alone is enough for me to say you just end things with this guy. Cliche I know; the internet is always fired up to tell women to break up with their mean nasty boyfriends, but I really can't imagine a legitamate justification for that. Photographer or not, it's pretty clearly hurtful (and what does it say to strangers who notice?) for him to have a sexy photo of another woman as his phone wallpaper, particularly one that he knows personally (it would be one thing if he just liked having a porn-style background, but it's *personal* in this case).\n\nI think the fact that he didn't change it despite you voicing your feelings about it closes the relationship. It's just such a dick move in the first place, and then the fact that he has the balls to keep it up after you pointed it out just indicates to me that he really has no concern for how you feel, and that is the hallmark of a cheater.",

I hate to be the \"show me your phone so I can trust you person\" but is there a logical reason why he's hiding these messages from you?  Did his password on his phone recently change?  \n\nHonestly, from what little you wrote, and what we can speculate is most likely something could have happened. He's interested and falling in love with her... and well  that's that. But think of it this way, if this is true, you're better off without someone you can't trust fully. \n\nI know many creative people who do nude modeling, sculptors and photographers... none of them behave in this manner.

Not sure what you can do about it, though, besides cut your losses and proceed as if no amount of asking him or trying to keep him would do any good.  I'd quietly walk away and see if he came after you or not.  Very hard to do.

            "Wow. I don't know where to start with this. There is so much to unpack. The thing that really jumped out to me was him dismissing your feelings as irrational. That is not okay. You have very good reason to feel the way you do, and even if you did not, dismissing someone and calling them irrational is not the way to deal with something. Calling someone irrational and dismissing them is a cheap tactic that he is using to get out of a sticky subject. Somehow, this is what men always say when they are caught being inappropriate. Gaslighting is a favorite of people who cheat. This is one big thing that makes me think he is cheating. You seem to be very rational about this and do not seem to be the overall jealous type. You seem to go out of your way not to be. If he were not guilty, a normal response would for him to look at what has been going on and talk to you, reassure you, etc...\n\nI also think at the least, he is having an emotional affair, although I do suspect it's more than that. He is prioritizing her over you by being late for nights out and what not. That is not okay. His phone habits and change in behavior are exactly the description of someone cheating. Don't even get me started on the suggestive picture of her he has on his phone. That is in no way appropriate. It's interesting how he chose a photo of a woman that he is so deeply invovled with to be his favorite because of the photographic elements. I can almost guarantee you that this is no coincidence. \n\nI'm not sure what advice I would give you. Most people who cheat will deny it until you have hard proof otherwise and will gaslight and try to make it out as you being insecure and crazy. Sometimes you will never know for sure. I would leave a relationship if I had strong doubts and my partner had given me reason to have such doubts (I stayed once and will never do it again), but that may not be what you want. I won't even assert that leaving is what you should do, as I am not exactly objective. \n",

High school sweethearts...well started dating right after high school. Not each other's first boyfriend/girlfriend but I've only had sex with him.\n\nJack and I have been married for 11 years. We have two kids. Both of our kids had special needs with our oldest being extremely high functioning and gifted and our younger child being in the moderate category for autism. Our youngest is 4.\n\nJack is a very successful person and while I had a promising career when our oldest child had issues we decided since I made less and had better medical background I would stay home. He was happy to do this as his own mom stayed home but it was hard for me as I always saw myself working and being successful. I'm being vague because he does read this sub. I took our oldest to all therapies and was an aide in preschool for him. Honestly without driving it was over a part time job and some years over a full time job.\n\nMy life became all about pushing this child uphill and itworked Now you would never know he had severe challenges. He still gets social therapy and needs anxiety help but really he just seems like a super smart child,\n\nWe were both still very much in love and decided to have our second child. This was before we knew our older one had aspbergers. Our oldest was diagnosed when our younger child was mere months old. With a newborn I still did all of the therapy, driving and preschool stuff with my older. Around age 2.5 it became apparent while our younger child was hitting milestones he regressed. He is one of the small percentage of children who regress after the age of two. I admit this fucked with me bad and I was suicidal. I was put on medication and am dealing well with it but I felt like my child was stolen. to go from fully verbal and conversational to mute and right when his brother was graduating all his therapies save social skills therapy was a huge mind fuck. I was gutted. I began putting on more weight and my eating for comfort got out of control. I'm now trying I sti to accept where our youngest is and take happiness in what strides he is making. l take on childcare and therapies. I'm never home long enough to clean and organize it and when I am I'm usually so beat and tired to organize the toys they dump etc. Forget spring cleaning it never happens. My husband was always messy so it just adds to it being a shithole of clutter(not filth the trash is taken out and dishes done but messy clutter and unwashed walls with kid prints on it). I feel I never get a break. He is worse off than his brother in many ways but he is also the happiest kid.\n\nWhen we got married I was 130lbs and 5'8. Looking back I think I was extremely attractive but had poor self esteem as I was not American ideals and was bullied a lot for my \"ethnic looks\". After our first was born I struggled to lose weight but I did. After our second I was losing weight until my oldest was diagnosed with aspbergers. I then comfort ate. Currently I am 260lbs. The heaviest I have ever been. I'm on depression medication. Our house is a mess, I'm always stressed out and just exhausted. Jack has always been overweight but it never bothered me. I'm talking around 220 most of his adult life and he is 5'9. He is now 245. He does have some health stuff but it's minor and not severe. His professional life is super bright but due to our children's needs you wouldn't tell how well he is doing for himself.\n\nMy birthday he \"forgot\" because I was depressed and did not want to go out due to my younger child being kicked out of a preschool so we didn't even cut a store bought cake. His birthday came around and he got himself something expensive and nice and I also got him a nice gift and card. I planned a surprise party for him. I'm trying to have the kids make him a father's day gift. I make sure every day to tell him how much I adore him and love him.\n\nI feel unloved. We never have sex anymore. The kids reject him because he barely interacts-if I am honest he may have aspbergers himself- so I am putting them to bed. I ask him and he says he's tired or work or whatever else excuse. Today he turned down a bj. Not even a bodily response when I was trying to initiate it. He says it's just the kids, stress, work, exhaustion, his back hurts literally everything.\n\nHe swears he loves me and is attracted to me still but the lack of sex unless I literally beg him bothers me. He jacks off so I know it's not a testosterone thing. I've offered counseling and he says he loves me and doesn't know where it is coming from. I'm starting to feel like we're married because I am a SAHM and can bring our special needs kid to 100000 appointments and he worries if we divorce who would do it not to mention he probably would feel bad if he left me because our kids.\n\nI love him so much but either he is in denial or I am crazy. I want to stay married to him. I don't think I could ever love someone the way I love him but I don't think he loves me anymore- and again he swears he does. I just don't get how we would have sex every day then every other day after our first was born then three times a week after our second was born to now I'm lucky if I get it twice a month and I have to harass him for it. He doesn't initiate it. It kills me because I just feel ugly. I also suspect he is upset the house went to hell but I feel like I can't keep up both my kids are in therapies granted my oldest who is gifted is just in a private social group but still I never have a break.\n\nHe works until 8pm most weekdays and I feel it may be a choice. When he gets home he's on his computer or takes hours on the bathroom where he hides from us. When he is home he seems irritated with everything. We do date nights a few times a month but it's either silent or me filling conversation. I'm so lost and I don't know where to start. When I ask him what I need to do or how I can fix this he reassures me he loves me and is just tired and nothing is broken.\n\nI was raised by a single mom so I really don't know what to do here and if I am being crazy. I'm too ashamed to ask my female friends because they joke their husbands bug them for sex too much and they are tired. Is it normal to have a super dead bedroom for over a year in long relationships? I just want to fix this. I love him.",

            "I\u2019m so sorry. Reading all of that, of course you feel down.\n\nYou said he makes a good living, yes? Could y\u2019all afford for a maid to come in, just once a week, to tidy up the house?\n\nBetter yet, maybe hire a professional caretaker to handle the kids for 1-2 days per week. Taking them to appointments, taking care of their needs, etc.\n\nIf you could free up just a bit of time for yourself, where you can handle other household tasks, prep healthy meals that can be stored in the freezer for the rest of the week, or even just go do something you used to love for a while, I think the entire energy of the home could be changed. You just need help.\n\nOne idea could be that you hire a maid, yes, and then also hire a professional caretaker to take care of your kids 3 nights a week for an hour or so. With that time, go work out\u2014it sounds like this weight issue is causing more problems than just physical discomfort for you, it sounds like it\u2019s really hitting your self-esteem hard, as well.\n\nTL;DR: You need to call in reinforcements of SOME kind. I agree that your husband should be coming in earlier and helping around the house more, but sometimes our spouses need to see us make a big, difficult change ourselves, and then they can begin to see the light, and follow along.\n\nNot that you haven\u2019t already been shouldering the burden of so many responsibilities in this relationship already! But sitting down with him and saying, \u201cI\u2019m unhappy, and I\u2019ve identified some of the key reasons why, and here\u2019s my game plan for how to fix it: I\u2019m getting a maid to come clean once a week, and I\u2019m hiring a professional sitter to watch the kids while I go work out three nights a week. I think we\u2019re both unhappy coming home to a filthy house, and I know my self-esteem has tanked since gaining this weight, and I genuinely think that coming home to a bright, clean house and feeling like I still have *some* time to focus on just me, will dramatically improve the energy around here, and even in our relationship.\u201d\n\nGo ahead and find out the pricing of maids and professional sitters in your area, reconcile it with your budget, and lay it out for him so he can see the benefit.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s a great chance your husband does in fact love you tremendously still, but he\u2019s feeling so bogged down and sad about where he is in life right now, sex just sounds difficult. Men are emotional creatures, too, and sex is an emotional act. Masturbation is a basic release, but sex requires intimacy and vulnerability. If he\u2019s feeling overweight, in pain, worried that he\u2019s disappointing you, and overwhelmed about his house, his children, and his job, (have you asked him why he stays so late? Maybe he genuinely has a lot on his plate?) sex isn\u2019t going to sound great, despite what we\u2019re told about men basically being animals when it comes to always wanting sex.\n\nStart to contain The Overwhelm, beginning first with things that you can do on your own, (since he\u2019s rejecting the idea of couple\u2019s therapy ATM) and see if the mood and general calm in your house begins to improve.\n\nObviously, again, this isn\u2019t your fault or your sole responsibility, (I hope I don\u2019t sound like I\u2019m saying this is on you?) but since you\u2019re on your own for right now, take charge where you can, and see what things can change, so you can gradually take steps toward a healthier, happier home environment for you and your family.\n\n**Edit:** OP, check below this comment for a LOT of great recommendations for resources! Lots of Redditors suggested some great ways to get help that sound perfect for you!",
            "I second the childcare option 1/2 days a week. I think if you have some time to yourself to get things going as far as weight loss by prepping healthy food for the week and maybe some alone time with yoga or some other healthy activity-I liked spinning, It will do wonders for your\nPsyche. Also, getting your hair/nails done can do wonders for your self esteem. Work on you.  If by then he doesn\u2019t seem to be responding to your pleas to fix your relationship, you may want to rethink your relationship. By then, with some self confidence, you\u2019ll hopefully have the strength to do what you need to do. Therapy is also a wonderful thing.",
            "Oh my God this sounds so hard on you. You have so much on your plate. I think that the main problem is that you need to take care of two high maintenance children 24/7. Most people would feel exhausted and depressed and like everything is up in flames all the time. On top of that there's the relationship peoblem with your husband.\n\nThe first thing you should do is find a way to have some free time. Some time to feel like yourself again and you'll feel a lot better. Did a sitter, or a maid. Maybe friends or family. Anyone that can take some of the burden off of you. Work your problems out with a therapist and press on the marriage counseling. \n\nBest of luck",
            "Among other things, your husband may be unconsciously afraid to have sex and accidentally end up with a third kid. \n\nFor now, change what you have the power to change. See a therapist for your stress, depression and eating disorder. Get some respite care so you\u2019re not a slave to the kids/house 24/7. Find a couples counselor. Go away for a long weekend without the kids. The dead bedroom is a symptom of a bigger set of problems that need to be addressed.",
            "You mustmustmust call in some reinforcements. Hire a maid or sitter if you can afford it.  Ask a friend or family member to sit with the kids so you can clean, work out, meditate, whatever. Put your shame to the side and confide in a friend; I know what a difficult proposition this is but I bet you'll be pleasantly surprised at the love and support you will receive. Even if someone will just help you take the kids for a walk and let you vent, that would do wonders. Being a caretaker is exhausting and if you don't take care of yourself, you're no good to anyone else.\n\nIt sounds like you're probably already doing this, but depending where you live (I'm assuming U.S.) you should be able to access a variety of support services for your children. In addition to school-based special education programs, there may also be personal care assistance, a community companion, or a safe place where you can drop the kid(s) off after school hours for activities and social time. Just an hour to breathe sounds like it would amazing for you. I work in this field, please feel free to inbox me. \n\nLastly, your husband has GOT to acknowledge the tenuous state of both your emotions and marriage. This will never get better if he continues to bury his head in the sand. He needs a serious come to jesus moment.",
            "Your husband also sounds depressed. Has he  been seen by a therapist?  I think it would behoove you both to put this at the top of your list. If he HAS been seen, low libido (yes, even while sometimes jacking off) can be a major side effect.  He could ask to transition to a new medication. \n\nSecondly, PLEASE hire someone or reach out to a close friend about cleaning your home. You cannot be happy in a messy home. And there is someone out there who loves you and shows love through acts of service. Reach out to her. \n\nThird, it doesn't take a ton of effort to start losing weight.  This will come across differently to different people, but I'm talking to YOU and it sounds like you'd like to lose weight. \n\n\nFourth, and this can be done at any time, is self care. Take a bath. Read a book. Light a candle and just sniff it. Sit in the back yard and admire the clouds. Go out to the mall and just look at jewelry. Cross stitch, or whatever your hobby is. Rent a movie YOU want to see. If you want to be with your man, get someone to watch the kids for a night and go out with just your husband. It doesnt have to be anything extravagant, but if theres anything you've thought \"I wish I had time to do that\", DO IT.  \n\n\n**Make yourself a priority. Yes, that will mean letting something else slide, but you are also important and you can't keep up if you don't fill up your fuel tank.**\n\n\n\n**My weight loss regimen recommendation:** \nStart small. Cut dessert and empty calorie snacks for three months. Add in sliced raw red peppers or celery. Add Greek yogurt flavored with fruit.  Don't worry about exercising. Do you already cook? Great, make spinach salads once a week (grill some chicken breast and add to a bowl with baby spinach, a touch of cheese, some tomatoes, berries, onions, and a hint of dressing. Change it up as you see fit).  Don't cook? Awesome! Each place you eat will have lower calorie, more nutritious options. No, they won't taste as delicious,  but they'll be serving a purpose. And remember, just starting with 3 months. Not weight goal. Not an exercise goal. Just a goal of changing your relationship with food. You're eating for fuel, and nutrition. And you're doing it so you feel more able to keep up with your kids and to feel more confident about your body. \n\n\n\n**My cleaning regimen recommendation:**\nIt will take one day. All garbage out first.  New bags in all trash cans. Find all the laundry, sort it, start it. Keep it going as you work on straightening the rooms. Start one room at a time. Usually I start in the bathrooms. Anything out of sight is a new project, so just clear counters and floors. If you find dishes, they go to the kitchen, but dont you dare start washing them until every other room is clear. At this point, take a break (sit down as needed, but distractions get put away through the rest). \n\nYour home, while not spotless, is liveable and will make your brain clear. Next, disinfect bathrooms, vacuum floors, and keep that laundry going. Empty leftovers out of the fridge if it's been a while. Wash the dishes with your friend, or leave them for the cleaner. Dusting is a cleaner's job, or can be saved for a different day. As is mopping. As is anything super gross. Get someone to do it if it's bad, and then work to maintain it or hire it out if you dont have the time. This is worth the expense.",
            "Here\u2019s what you do.\n\n1. Hire a maid to tidy and clean your house 1-2 days a week. They honestly are not as expensive as you might think, and there is NO SHAME AT ALL in having help around the house. You are doing an amazing job as a mother and as you said, you don\u2019t have time to be housekeeper as well. Organise this ASAP - living in a clean and tidy house really will make you and your husband feel so much better. Trust me on this. \n\n2. Look into how much it would cost to hire a professional nanny to take care of the kids, even if it\u2019s only for one day a week. Having that time to yourself, in a clean house, to do nothing but relax and FUN things, will really improve your mood. This will help rub off on your husband,too.\n\n3. Lose the weight. I know you\u2019ve gained a lot and it must feel like you\u2019ve got to climb a mountain, but you CAN do this. It\u2019ll make a huge difference in your self esteem and your husband\u2019s sex drive. Think back to what you used to eat (and how big your portion sizes were) back when you were 130lbs. If you start making those same food choices again, you will eventually get back down there. You don\u2019t *have* to work out, though it\u2019s beneficial - you\u2019ll lose the weight just from consuming fewer calories. A great place to start is My Fitness Pal. \n\n4. Ask your husband what he needs, what he\u2019s stressed about, and how you can help. He may be feeling overwhelmed himself, but keeps it all inside.",
            "Couples counseling STAT. If he won\u2019t go, you go. You can\u2019t continue to take care of everyone else\u2019s needs when you\u2019re not taking care of yourself. \n\nYou\u2019ve been a superhero doing what you\u2019re doing. He needs to meet you halfway and take some of the care taking load off of you. He can\u2019t come home and hide in the toilet anymore. These are his kids and he needs to start acting like it. \n\nBut seriously, you\u2019re with your rights to demand he participates in counseling with you. You guys sound like you have a lot of issues you need help unpacking.",
            "I have been exactly where you are. My husband and I have been together years. We have four children. One has BPD, one has autism, one has ADHD, and my youngest is dyslexic. I am SAHM and my husband works like 70 hours a week. While we are still working on getting our home where we want it we did get our relationship back on track. \n\nFirst thing we did is get a calendar and start planning our weeks together and making time each week for an evening together, even if it was at home to have dinner and watch our show together. That time is sacred and we do not discuss tough topics during that time. We also schedule 30 minutes once a week to touch base with each other on how we are feeling, discuss tough topics, and bring up any issues we need to address. These things started to help us become more connected to each other as individuals instead of parents or partners. \n\nSecond thing we have done is we make it a point to touch one another. A hand brush across the back as you pass behind them. Hand on the knee while watching tv.  Hugs when he gets home from work. Any kind of casual touch. It has helped us become more affectionate with each other. \n\nThird, and possibly the most important for us, we stopped talking negatively about our life. It\u2019s so easy to be unhappy and dissatisfied and it takes real work to make this kind of change but it really helped us. We started making real plans for our future. We decided instead of being negative about the things we are unhappy about we are going to work together to change them. A big component of this is being supportive of the other person when they are having a down day and do your best to keep them motivated to make the changes you need to make. \n\nWe did this two years ago and now we are so much closer and have a great bedroom life. Our children have all their conditions under control and managed. We have made plans to fix up and sell our home to move out of state next year. We have taken two vacations where we hadn\u2019t taken one in the past 7 years. We are working on losing weight together with DDPY. I hope some of this can help you. I really feel for you.",
            "First of all I wanna say that you're an amazing mother for your children! They're lucky to have you. But yeah, you're husband needs to parent his children as well so he can get to know them and you can balance the work load. You guys needs therapy or other intervation to work out your problems.",
            "Sorry - this is off-topic for the question asked. For your younger child, has he been evaluated for Landau Kleffner syndrome? My son had similar symptoms.\n\nIt's a rough situation - I know you're probably burnt out on appointments, but I'd recommend therapy. And just realizing you're both going through hard times.",
            "I'm Autistic and I was raised by a single mom, my husband is also probably on the spectrum though he passes as nuerotypical in almost every way, I know deep down that our common ground and thought patterns are the same. He just has much fewer physical symptoms than I do. I see his rituals, his stims, his patterns, I see the way he struggles with change. \n\nAutism research is coming out so fast right now that doctors can't even keep up. It's as if every strange kid that knew something about them was different became a researcher to figure out what it was and the results are flooding in. We are now learning that most people aren't diagnosed with autism until they are literally disabled by it. In the same way that you suspect your husband may be on the spectrum, it's entirely likely that you are as well. You may not have as many of the physical symptoms, but you are clearly very sensory-seeking (touch and taste) and I'm sure I don't have to tell you that women with autism are more likely to be depressed, anxious and have suicidal thoughts. Women with autism are often skipped over because we tend to mimic behavior better than men are able to. \n\nI highly recommend you do some research into the r/autismtranslated #actuallyautistic community, it may help you with understanding yourself, your younger son, and your husband better. It could improve all of your relationships\n\nIn regards to the weight gain, I also was obese most.of my life because I had a strong need to comfort eat. I lost weight after I was diagnosed ADHD and started meds, that helped me fix my disordered eating habits. What helps me the most now is chewing gum and I have a stim toy from Ark Therapeutic, so much better than chewing gum, it's a necklace I can chew on and after I got it, it made me realize how much of my desire or eat was literally JUST a desire to chew. It has changed my life.\n\nAaaaand finally I agree that your husband is stuck and in denial. And I agree that he's probably on the spectrum because he has some fairly obvious executive dysfunction issues. This is super common in adults that were never diagnosed, they hate change so they wedge themselves into a spot and undercut themselves to avoid having to make any significant changes, they just try to problem-solve the immediate threats to keep the whole situation stable and that's about the most they are capable of doing, abstract big life changes are incredibly difficult to even imagine, let alone execute. \n\nHe's not willing to think about his problems, so he doesn't. So yes, he is still in love with you but he's not willing to address any of the issues in his life because he can't/doesn't know how. Executive dysfunction on a huge scale is something I experience a lot, a few examples: can't come out as gay if you haven't been in a gay relationship, can't be in a gay relationship unless you come out as gay. Can't get a job without experience, no job will hire you without experience. I want to see a doctor to feel better because I know my life is a mess, but doctors only make me feel worse?? I can't be openly autistic if I don't have a diagnosis, but if I can't hide my autism, that must mean I'm not really austic/don't need a diagnosis?\n\nAll of those are walls that controlled my behavior and would get me stuck. I did eventually get unstuck, but the only way to do it is to force yourself to think about the unpleasant things and have someone talk you through it, help you through it. On a small scale I experience executive dysfunction when I'm lying in bed and I CANT get out of bed. Sometimes my husband has to carry me to the bathroom so I can start my day and make it to work on time. It's like I'm a turtle stuck upside down and I need someone to flip me over\n\nYou gotta flip him over. But I warn you, it is a can of worms. If he doesn't want to look inside you can't make someone. You can't make someone be happy. If you usher in a diagnosis for him, it won't help him if he doesn't realize he's stuck. I'm sure he absolutely does love you and he doesn't want to live without you (like you feel with him, and he also wants to see through his end of the deal, caring for you as a partner and being a father.\n\nThere are things you both can do to address the dead bedroom. If it helps you any, I have also been in this situation. The energy it takes to masturbate is much less than the energy it takes to have sex with someone and fulfill their emotional needs and this can be hard to manage for us spergies. One thing that helped me, was learning about emotional labor. When it takes effort to do emotional things but we plan and allocate our energy accordingly so our partners and relationships don't suffer for it. \n\nBecause I am attention and touch seeking, I found it helpful to make an agreement that if they don't have it in them to have sex, we cuddle naked for a half hour instead. My desire for sex is honestly 85% a desire to be held and cuddled, 5% a desire to feel like I'm sexy, 5% a desire to feel like I'm a good wife, and 5% horny. I can do other things to make myself feel sexy, and feel like a good wife, and get off. I can't cuddle myself. So he makes time to do this for me and honestly the skin contact over time helped wake his libido up. Another helpful thing was kinda loosely planning sex. I track my cycles and there are just times when we tend to have sex. It's basically become part of our routine. I promise it's not as unsexy as it sounds, it's honestly less like we plan for it and more like our bodies do. We just know we're going to want it then. So like if I'm horny and he's not in the mood, I'm not bummed out because I know there's a time coming in the near future. He also makes an effort to spend more emotional labor on giving me attention, especially if he has to shoot me down\n\nAll of that said, these are all super easy to accomplish when you aren't busy with kids. Let alone kids that the world doesn't understand. I agree that you guys are super undersupported and it is Impossible to develop better relationships with others if you can't even develop a relationship with yourself while you're stretched past your limit. Others have made suggestions on what to do in that arena and I hope you find those suggestions helpful\n\nAaaaand finally I wanna add some words of Hope and encouragement that you find a channel of communication with your younger kid. Maybe they will be hyperplexic, maybe they will be gifted with art. There's a channel in there somewhere, I wish you the best of luck finding it",
            "I read this whole thing and didn\u2019t read one thing about you doing something for yourself. I honestly feel like, along with other people\u2019s advice, that you should find something that brings you joy. Because regardless of what happens with your husband and kids you still need to be happy. Your kids want to see you happy as they grow. \n\nIf working again is what would bring you joy, find work you can do part time, if some kind of hobby brings you joy, find a group of fellow crafters to meet with and do projects with. \n\nFind something that brings *YOU* joy.",

            "I don't think that your weight gain is related to or a reason for to the disconnect/disinterest in sex. Plenty of people in your weight range are sexy, desirable and have engaged and involved partners.

I'm just further down the road than you are. \n\nI have two boys with special needs (autism - different places on the spectrum, but higher functioning) and a younger daughter who would probably be called gifted/neurotypical. \n\nMy ex husband had colon cancer the year before we split up (and he recovered).

We became very disconnected over the final 5 years or so of our relationship. \n\nWe worked on all of it. I eventually lost 100lbs just before the cancer diagnosis (went down to about 205 from a high of somewhere over 300, also 5'8). It didn't make any difference, we were just so far gone and he didn't know how to work on it without me doing all of the planning and work. I think between the kids, the stress of everything that happened, I also wasn't working..   It was too much. We'd also gotten together young (I was 19) and we had changed dramatically as people. With him being a little autistic, I'd been basically coaching him as to how to become a decent husband for YEARS. It was exhausting. I couldn't fight this final battle too. I couldn't ask him to step up and love me properly anymore. I needed him to know what was needed and just DO as needed. So, it ended.\n\nI got a job, I kept the house, and it was a rocky time for a while. Eventually, he figured out how to be a single parent and so did I. The kids adjusted really well. We have a great routine and a positive attitude. I've had a few long term relationships over the past 6 years since we separated, he eventually found a new partner and they have a house together. She seems to be good for him and the kids like her too. I'm recently out of a relationship and on the cusp of starting something new - slowly. Things are going well, I love my work and I have the house under control. Currently I'm about 235, 42 years old and I feel secure, sexy and pretty happy. It took a while to get to that place, but I did get there. \n\nThat's my story. \n\nIf you want to work on it, please realize that what has happened to you is HARD and it takes both people working on it and being conscious of the other's needs to make a difference. You can't shoulder all of the blame here. You can't do all of the work to save it. You can't be the only one to acknowledge that there is a problem. \n\nWhat would have really helped in my situation was: my ex stepping up in a meaningful way. I would have wanted him to remember my birthday and mothers day, touch me when we were both in the kitchen at the same time, try to do things to make me happy, try to fix things. I think I should have returned to work rather than staying home - my mental state improved dramatically when I felt I was doing meaningful work that supported my family. We should have pressed the issue of taking time specifically for us. We didn't have family support in the way of babysitting or any acknowledgement that things were hard. \n\nThat said, I'm not sure that it would have saved anything, but it might have helped. \n\nI really, really feel for you. If you ever need to reach out, I am around and seem to have lived all of this. All the best, OP.",

You are taking care of two high-demand kids, with virtually no support from your husband, who disappears all day every day. He may be on the spectrum and therefore has difficulty seeing your point of view anyway. On his birthday, he treats himself; on your birthday, you wait for something from him. You neglected a healthy diet and lifestyle for yourself while pouring all your energy into your kids. You don't mention friends or a social life, but I'm guessing those are nonexistent.

            "I'm really sorry for all that you're going through. People have given some great advice so I'm not going to reiterate it, but I used to work in disability advocacy so I wanted to bring up a couple of options you might consider exploring. The state I used to live and work in (Minnesota) was admittedly more progressive on this than most, but the point is that there are likely state programs that could help you get some relief, one way or another, even if it's not as extensive. I know you've been going through this as long as your children have been alive, so I apologize if you are way ahead of me and already know about this stuff. Anyway, disability things to look into:\n\n\\-Becoming a \"paid parent\"/being recognized as your children's personal care assistant/direct service professional (PCA or DSP). I know parents sometimes feel guilt around this but as you recognized, it's like a full time job, doing all these things. So if you can get some reimbursement, definitely look into that. Alternatively, you could look into getting part time help from a PCA or DSP.\n\n\\-Some states have programs to provide assistance to families of children with disabilities that technically make more than the threshold of income. Your comment about how your husband makes decent money but you wouldn't necessarily be able to tell due to costs made me think of this. You might be eligible for services, even if you don't think you are.\n\n\\-Disability community. I did not have any experience with the community prior to my job but I was blown away by the community there. Parents, other family members, professional advocates, self advocates (people with disabilities themselves)... don't count them out. There are facebook groups, in-person support groups, and more. I knew one high functioning teen girl with autism who had a support group of autistic peers to spend time with and this was really helpful to her. As your kids get older, this might be helpful. Look into local disability nonprofit organizations for support and resources.\n\nOn weight loss: if this is something you'd like to pursue, come join us on r/loseit! I'm on a \\~weight loss journey (gag) myself right now. Sometimes I kick myself for not starting sooner, but the truth is that for whatever reason, I wasn't ready until I was ready. Nothing wrong with lurking and gaining information until that point arrives.\n\nI wish you the best and hope you will take some of the advice in this thread-- you absolutely deserve a break and I hope things work out for you.",
            "I\u2019m not sure if anyone added this and it seems like you may be well connected to resources with your different therapies but definitely check out your community center board and see about available respite care options. They can connect you with people. Typically, there are funds and grants for this and people who work respite care are knowledgeable about children with special needs. You deserve a break and at least a minute to do something for yourself. I\u2019m sorry so much is going on. It sounds like you feel lonely. You have  done everything you can to support your children. There is support out there for you too.",
            "It seems like you need to invest in help.  You mention your husband bought himself something expensive for his birthday so it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re struggling financially.  Why not invest in some household help? Have someone come and clean the house every couple of weeks.  Invest in a meal delivery service, if only for a little while, to give yourself a break.  Insist on therapy with your husband, it doesn\u2019t sound like he refuses to go, but said nothing\u2019s wrong, and maybe he doesn\u2019t think so, but YOU do, so take him.  Was your husband exhibiting evidence of being on the spectrum before the kids were born, if you think back and say no, he may just not know what to do with them.  Perhaps try teaching/showing him.  Insist he comes with you to put the kids to bed, show him how you do it for a week, then the next week he does it while you\u2019re there with him.  It may also not be that he\u2019s not attracted to you, but is also stressed and worried and doesn\u2019t know what to do, but therapy can help that too.

            "First of all, I just want to let you know how amazing you are. This is a lot to go through and it sounds like you are an amazing mom that always puts her kids first.\n\nA lack of sex is not always an indication of how much your partner loves you or how attracted to you they are. At least, not in the face of this much stress. For a lot of people, stress absolutely kills their sex drive regardless of who their partner is, so I don't think that his behaviour necessarily means that he is in denial about his feelings. I think that it indicates that he has very avoidant/escapist coping strategies and doesn't know how to relieve that stress productively.\n\nIt sounds to me like you might view self care as a luxury that neither of you can afford in the face of your children's struggles. But that lack of mental health maintenance is causing a ton of emotional/physical problems. Of course that's easy enough to diagnose as the problem and much harder to fix.\n\nI would take time with your husband to think about and discuss what you both need in order to feel healthy mentally. That might include more productive strategies for coping with stress, including strategies that can help connect the two of you emotionally. \n\nI agree with others regarding calling in backup of some kind in the form or childcare or housekeeping or even meal prep. Spending more time maintaining your mental health will make the other problems just a bit easier to tackle.",

            "Since you expect your husband to be on the spectrum too, it might be very well the case that he doesn't realize his emotions. This is not uncommon with people with Aspergers, whether they are high functioning or low functioning. That means sometimes you'll have to push him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSit down with him and tell him: \"I love you very much, but I believe you do have a problem. You experience sensory overload quite a lot, also your symptoms fit the criteria of depression.\" Have the list of criteria ready and check them off with him. He most likely is not aware he has a problem. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe 'atypical' way in which people who are on the spectrum experience emotions can often cause being reserved and not actually processing emotions. Your partner doesn't want help, because he doesn't see the problem (he genuinely doesn't see it). I think actually making him realize the problem would make him more willing.

It is FUCKING HARD and frankly it sounds like you\u2019re killin\u2019 it as a mom. Give yourself some credit!!! Yes, you and your husband gained some weight, so what. You are both stressed to the max. If food helps you cope, well, it\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s better than alcohol or cigarettes or opiates. \n\nSpecial needs kids are also very hard on marriages. Sadly many marriages do not survive when a baby is born with special needs. But obviously you\u2019re wanting your marriage to survive and thrive. So kudos to you for that. \n\nI am guessing that your husband still loves you, but is rejecting you sexually because he feels guilty and depressed and inadequate and stressed out, and that makes him not want sex. Maybe there is some bullshit going on at his work that he doesn\u2019t want to burden you with so he keeps it to himself. And that\u2019s a good insight that he may be Asperger\u2019s himself\u2014there is a genetic component, after all.\n\nI agree with the other comments. You and your husband need help. Housekeeping help, and caretaking help. And I\u2019m a huge fan of counseling. If he won\u2019t go, then counseling for you definitely.

It all starts with you two sitting down together, confiding in each other and then creating a plan on how you can get the most out of life.

            "My God woman, you are incredibly strong and resilient to be going through all of this alone. I have a small grasp on how hard it is to raise one special needs child, but two? We need to take a moment here to appreciate your inner strength. Those kids will have a great role model with you. That being said, you didn't really mention how you feel about your body. Do you want to change it or do you maybe just need to feel sexy again? I would chat with him and see if maybe the lack of confidence is what's killing your bedroom instead of your weight gain. Otherwise you could try finding an activity that you enjoy doing (like swimming, running, kick boxing) that you will commit to 3 times a week to improve yourself. Exercise can also be a great emotional outlet, so I recommend that regardless of your body image. \nI also second the maid/caretaker/therapy answers. You have a lot going on and you need help. That much is obvious to strangers on the internet. I'm unsure about the cost of those things, but I would reach out to your children's doctors and see who they reccomend. Also you might want to find communities/support groups for parents with special needs children. That way you can vent and receive helpful input from people who are going through the same thing. \nI hope you and your husband can work things out, and I'm sure you both will because it really sounds like you love each other dearly.

Also, maybe suggesting your husband goes to therapy as well. I also am a firm believer of exercising! It helps with depression, makes you feel good, helps you lose weight. Then, consider what type of food you\u2019re eating - I can\u2019t imagine having 2 special needs kids, so I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll take time to figure out but eating healthier will be a wonderful addition to losing weight, having a better mental state, and feeling good about yourself.

Then, you\u2019d have an easier chance keeping it clean. \n\nAlso, hiring someone to help with your kids a few times a week will take off the burden so much, so you can go out with your girlfriends, have sex with your husband, or go have some serious necessary alone time!!

            "I grew up in an environment where my parents had a similar relationship.  My father truly loved my mother, but only showed it by being a good provider. He was a good father to me but not so great to my brothers. My mother felt totally unloved for years. And it wasn't about weight or special needs kids or a dirty house because she didn't have any of those issues.\n\n\nWhat happened with them is that my father (who i strongly suspect is in the spectrum) just could not give my mother what she needed.  She tried to tell him many times that she was unhappy and needed affection and love (and sex). They went to counseling a couple of times.  But my father just could not comprehend that his behavior was causing his marriage to disintegrate.  He was perfectly happy. He was able to do what he wanted and have it all. He didn't need (or want) a strong physical relationship to be happy and he didn't ever feel unloved because my mother did everything he expected and more.  He just couldn't get it through his head that my mother needed something he didn't understand and he didn't make much effort to meet her needs. \n\n\nAfter years of this, a predatory man began showering my mother with attention and she ate it up like a starving person finally getting gourmet food after years of nothing but the minimum to survive. My mother had an affair with him and eventually left my father. She was in an abusive relationship with that man for the rest of her life until she died.  Not a happy ending for anyone, least of all her. \n\n\nYou're human and you have needs. And limits.  It's time for marriage counseling. You have a lot invested in this relationship and if it can be salvaged, that's the ideal for everyone.  You are probably right about your husband being on the spectrum, he strongly reminds me of my father. That means he has some deficits that he probably had no idea about. \n\n\nIt's also time for individual counseling for you to figure out what you really need and how to get it. You need to step back from your endless responsibilities and get some help. Childcare and house cleaning support would go a long way. You need to get yourself emotionally healthy.  \n\n\nI always wondered whether my parents marriage would have survived if my mother had been a better advocate for herself.  I wondered whether my father ever understood how serious these issues were - he always said he was blindsided when she told him it was time for a divorce.  Your husband may be in the same boat. He's getting by and had no idea how dire the situation has become. \n\n\nBut it's also possible that no matter what you do, he won't ever change and won't ever be able to meet your needs.

You seem to have the logic that if a. your husband doesn't want to have sex with you or act a certain way romantically then b. your husband doesn't love you. On top of that you've come up with a very convincing narrative to back it up of, \"he only stays with me out of guilt.\" You're taking your husbands actions and interpreting them as if they're about you. And maybe they are! But there's a variety of other explanations. What if you trusted him that he does love you? I think then that implies that your husband is having challenges of his own with the life y'all have together. I hope he can be honest with you both if that's the case, but if not it's your job to take care of yourself, which there is tons of good advice for in this thread.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you did trust your husband that he loves you, could that change the conversation between you? Even if he does love you it sounds like he's not expressing that love in a way you can feel and hear, in a way that nourishes you and y'all's relationship. Your desire for him observing special days, talking during date nights, and having sex with you is ultra reasonable. If he's not going to be able to give you those things then it changes the terms of your relationship and you get to decide if that's a relationship you can live with. Could you ask him to love you differently? Could you ask him to do things that make you feel loved? Could y'all work together on connecting, recognizing you both might have limitations, but also that if he's gonna say he loves you and have you trust him then he needs to show it too?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck, this internet stranger is rooting for you and your family <3",

How much time do you have for yourself, to be your own person, to do your own thing?  Can you carve out one night a week that you are out of the house and your husband is on parenting duty? It will be hard. He won't do things the way you do them, your kids will be annoyed that the routine is adjusting but they will be just fine. He won't do it perfectly but as long as the kids are still breathing when you get home don't ask any questions on how it went - just assume he managed because he is a competent parent and did just fine.

Enjoy it.   \n\nOnce you have that down every week for several hours away from the kids, try and find respite care - maybe a saturday late morning so you and your husband can go on a date?

            "There's so much to unpack here so I apologize for the length of my response.  \n\nLet me start by telling you a little about myself. I'm a 41 year old woman who is the mom of two kids on the spectrum. Mine both are high functioning but while they both have genius IQ's they struggled with things that are as simple as tying your shoe or remembering to take a bath. I was a SAHM for 12 years until my divorce for exactly the reasons you stated. There's 11 billion appointments and with the amount of constant reminding and looking after my kids it took it seemed ridiculous to have me go to work.\n\nI'm telling you this so you can know I speak from experience and empathize with your position because there's several things that are going on here. The one I relate to the most is your depression, especially over your youngest's abilities. My youngest was my hard one. I lived in constant fear of being called from the school and just felt like this big huge failure as a mom. It was and still is a difficult road but back then I had depression so bad. I have to tell you, you need to get help. That means therapy plus meds. If your meds and therapy aren't helping then you need to change them.  You have to take care of yourself or you will not be able to take care of anything else. I suspect your husband might also need some therapy for depression as well. The disappointment and despair you feel when coming to terms with the life you pictured for your kids will never happen is no joke.\n\nI also think despite yall being busy and tired you need to see about getting into therapy together. These issues with your husband will only grow until everyone is so miserable that the whole thing implodes. Talk to your insurance company and see if they allow for respite care. A lot of them do if not, then look into your local autism support network and treat that like your second job until you majestic friends with at least two other autism mom's so you can trade off child care.  You and your husband are going to need some kind of way to have time to rest and reconnect and you can't do that with the kids around.\n\nHere will be the most unpopular statement I'll make.  I know you're tired. I know you're depressed. I know you feel unmotivated and it seems pointless but....clean up your house and take care of yourself. I almost hesitate to say this but honestly I have to. When I was a SAHM my house was spotless. I made home cooked meals every night. I'm only telling you this so you can see its doable. It takes planning and it takes resisting the temptation to let yourself off the hook because you're tired but it CAN be done. I want to be clear when I say I'm not telling you to do this for any other reason than yourself. There's no way you can even begin to start to feel better when everywhere you look there's a mess including in the mirror and your husband. You can't control your husband but you can control yourself and your environment.  My ex husband was messy as well and never lifted a finger and my house was still clean. One of the things that best improved my outlook on myself was to start taking care of myself. I started out dressing a little better then experimenting with my hair then make up etc. In the end I had a better self image all around.\n\nThese things will all take herculean efforts I'm not gonna lie. But I believe in you. You can do it.",
            "I am so sorry. It is time to hire help or apply for benefits for your children. It is also time for you to have a very clear conversation with your husband. It\u2019s great he works and makes money. It is not ok he has saddled you with enough life responsibility to utterly destroy your life. Something needs to change, you can not continue this way. I would begin to look for a therapist for yourself and talk to husband about going to couples therapy. You can change things but it will be you doing the work.

Your life as is sounds overwhelming to say the least. \nAlso, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve heard of r/keto and r/ketorecipes but I recommend you check them out if not. I lost weight fairly effortlessly following keto after feeling like the scale would never move for me. I\u2019m not saying you should follow this way of eating, but part of why I like it is because of how positive and supportive the community is- the energy of the sub has really helped me stick with it. \nOP I wish you only the best of luck!!

From what you say, he clearly hates his job. \n\nYou mentioned you are ethnic - is he ethnic as well? If he is, depending on how his upbringing was, he may be very reluctant to open up to people about this. He may have been raised in the kind of household where he was pushed into his particular career, and sky high expectations were placed on him since primary school. \n\nIt\u2019s bloody hard for a provider to admit that he is struggling.",

            "Having read your story twice, the Keto diet popped into my head multiple times. I\u2019ve been in a somewhat similar circumstance, and the depression is the real enemy here. \n\nFood can provide an emotional high as strong as any drug... but like any drug, is a viscous cycle.  Food in to feel better, depression worsens as weight gains. \n\nA true Keto diet (look up a few clean Keto cookbooks on amazon) will help with the weight, but actually is amazing for mental health. To put it as simply as I can, ketones are created in your body in response to not having eaten the body\u2019s favorite fuel, sugar/carbohydrates.  These ketones, along with other processes, switch the brain to \u201csurvival\u201d mode and allows you to literally think clearer and sharper. I don\u2019t know the science behind how or why, I just know that it works. \n\nIt worked on me, and if you google it, it works on many others. Weight loss on a Keto diet is a perk, the mental clarity is the real advantage.\n\nAnd if somehow you take this to heart, you can get your family involved as well because there is a chance that it can help with their special needs also. \n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get my head bit off for this... but I have been in your shoes and this is the only real advice that I can give....  the problems with husband and kids and relationship stuff are a result of everyone eating the \u201cstandard American diet\u201d. Cut out the sugar, and I truly believe that you\u2019ll be amazed to see the other issues in your life begin to fade away. \n\nAlso, a last point... this is not your fault and you are beautiful. :)",
            "The solution to this is simple, but hard. Men face similar problems all the time. We get fat. We stop feeling sexy. We stop exhibited the qualities our partner originally fell for. The biggest thing here is for you to start feeling attractive again.Based on what you've written, that means losing weight is number 1 on your itinerary. \n\nPeople are going to give you some touchy feely crap about how he should still want you if fat blah blah. Ignore that shit. The problem isn't necessarily your weight, the problem is how you feel about yourself bc of the weight and the lack of sex, and the apparent absence of activities you enjoy.\n\nThe key is you need to feel sexy again. Stop feeling sorry for yourself and find your discipline dammit. Start intermittent fasting, no food for 16 hours, eat during an 8 hour window. Stop buying sugary food. Being overweight is a choice in a sense, you are probably eating your feelings and feeling sorry for yourself and giving up. Make the decision to start exercising and eating well. At your weight you will probably drop 20 lbs the first month if you do that, your body doesn't want to carry that extra at all.\n\nOnce you stop prioritizing eating over being healthy, you are on your way. The 2nd obvious problem w your life is you are not prioritizing YOU. You need to start going out and doing things YOU enjoy. THERE IS NOTHING LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN A SELFLESS PARTNER WITH NO INTERESTS. Stop trying so hard. Be more selfish. Leave the boys with your husband or get a sitter and GO DO THINGS YOU ENJOY. You are in a terrible headspace right now. You have no balance to your life. You have adopted the selfless mother role and it is ruining you. For the love of god get your head out your you know what and become a whole person again.\n\nThis may sound harsh, but I have told myself just about everything I just told you, and my life has significantly improved as a consequence. Don't let people coddle you. You have it rough, but you are also fucking up. Take responsibility for yourself and your future. If you need a kick in the ass, just MSG me, we fats need to stick together. If you do what I tell you, your life will be MUCH better this time next year. Future you will love you for it.",

First, obligatory mention to /r/deadbedrooms. This is the sub for ongoing support here. You can post multiple times, unlike here, and get specific follow up that you need. \n\nNext, everyone has said it. You have to start by losing weight. You need to decide if that will be by a diet or if it will be by a lifestyle change. I've had two kids and I lost weight both ways. They both work but they both have pros and cons. \n\nDiet - the best is calorie counting. MyFitnessPal helps you watch what you do. Count calories in a healthy way. Substitute lesser calories things like cauliflower instead of rice and you'll lose weight at about 1-2lbs a week. Check with your doctor first, though. \n\nLifestyle - If you get all of your food at Whole Foods and literally eat things like chicken and salad (watch the dressing) then you'll not only drop weight you will have 10x more energy packed into your body. Seriously, eating organic, whole foods, is like putting premium gas in the car. You will run so much better. \n\nSo, it's up to you. If you focus on your health, the rest should come around. \n\nFinal thought - google oxytocin and autism. I've seen some crazy things from an autistic kid who started an oxytocin nasal spray, prescribed by his doctor. But, it's emerging research, so it's not everywhere yet. It's worth your google energy! \n\nBest to you!",

It'll help you get rid of a lot of stuff; less stuff=less clutter to clean. With less to clean you may feel less motivated to comfort eat and possibly more motivated to do active things like take a walk with the kids or play with them in the yard which will help with loosing weight. That could lead to better mental health. The decluttering method can be stressful and cause a lot of emotions to rise up but I've experienced it as a good thing and emerged from the other side with less weight on my mind. It helped me be more concious of what I buy and how i spend my time.

In fact, I would argue that you don't actually need someone to come help around the house/help with the boys.

Look up books by Viktor Frankl for a few thoughts on this.  For this problem, setting goals, then achieving them is key.  Please emphasize that addressing this problem is key to doing anything about the other problems!\n\nThe two of you together can do something about the relationship which is the second problem.  Either of you alone can't fix it.  Only working together will get you there.  Others have given excellent suggestions of ways to address this which I won't repeat.  It is past time to have a heart to heart talk with him and get him to recognize that things can't continue the way they are.  You mention that he also might be on the spectrum.  If so, he will be especially reluctant to do anything positive.\n\nThe third problem is the children.  As a father of a child with Asperger's, I can empathize.  Look into local groups that can help with your children's socialization.  Just seeing a counselor is not enough.  We spent a couple of years going to a weekly group meeting in a city 100 miles away so he could have the experience of interacting with children who have similar issues.  Most important, the program focused on social skills such as how to behave in a restaurant (order a meal, act appropriately while eating, leaving a tip, thanking the server, etc).  While this sounds redundant, it is exactly the type of skill a child with Asperger's needs to learn.\n\nYour husband sounds disconnected from his wife and from his family.

His family mainly his sisters and mother [55F, 24F, 27F] have been really welcoming and really welcomed me and my mother & sister into their family. They are a close family so we all live in the same city and they normally hang out every Saturday. I am pregnant with our first child. We both have our dream jobs and everything is fine apart from his father \n\nI get aggressively hit on by men when I go out, it's part of the reason why when I am in a relationship I rarely go out to bars or anything like that. If my friends want to hang out we normally go to the mall and even then some guys comes up and talks to us. I am not a cheater, I hate cheaters my father cheated on my mother and it tore my family apart. So I have gotten my fair share of unwanted dick pics is what I am trying to get at. So one thing I will never do is cheat on buck. \n\nHi father and mother are divorced and 2 weeks ago I met his father for the first time. His father lives on the other side of the country in New York with his new wife. His father flew out to see his children and this was my first time meeting him in person. He seemed nice enough completely different from the rest of the family. He seemed really cold and to the point. \n\nWe exchanged details just to you know, stay in contact because he is my fiance father. His father seemed rather closed off and he stated he hated leaving NY and hated people in general. Buck and his father are not close like he is to the rest of the family. They seem to only communicate because they are father and son. They just don't seem to really like each other. \n\nOver night I got a message on Facebook from him and it was a picture of him holding his dick, one flaccid and one erect. With the words after it \"You Like red?\" I have red hair so that's why he called me that. \n\nBuck is still sleeping and I am not sure how to address this with him and my friends will just cause a huge fucking drama, like they always do. I just need some advice please \n\ntl;dr: boyfriends father sent me a dick pick \n\n",

I have exciting stuff to tell you guys! First I wanted to say thanks to everybody who commented, you all really helped me calm down and stop overthinking everything. I appreciate it a lot.\n\nWhen Danny showed up we were both really nervous and awkward at first. I was really scared to say anything, but I broke the tension by telling him how much I had enjoyed the night before. He broke out into a huge grin and turned bright red, lit up like a christmas tree. He told me he was so relieved, and that he had been obsessing over it all night worried for the same reasons I had been. \n\nI told him that it was my first sexual experience ever and that I was questioning my sexuality now. He told me that he had been questioning his sexuality for a while, and that he had feelings for men before, but had mostly seen me as just a friend until last night, when he realized that I was kind of sort of coming onto him in a really roundabout way. It's funny, I didn't really think of myself as coming onto him but I definitely made that statement hoping something would come of it...\n\nAnyway I told him that first and foremost I valued our friendship and wanted to stay friends whatever happened between us. He agreed strongly. He asked me if I was okay with working out our feelings together (read: having sex until we figure out how we feel) and I told him yes. After all this heavy conversation we decided to play some CS:GO together like we usually do but we ended up in bed together instead. Afterwards we talked some more and discussed the possibility of a relationship. He said he feels like we know each other well enough that he wouldn't feel like we were rushing in, and I agreed with him. He asked me to be his boyfriend, and I said yes! I'm so happy about it, too! I've never felt so attracted to anyone before.\n\nWe haven't told anyone yet, but decided not to go out of our way to keep it a secret. The area we live in is reasonably tolerant and neither of our parents are anti-gay, which I am grateful for. I am worried about telling my sister, who has recently become a born-again christian and had a lot of horrible things to say\nabout the supreme court ruling on FB. I'm also a little concerned about telling our other two friends, but I think after the initial shock wears off, they'll come around.\n\nNow, I'm not super duper concerned with slapping a label on my sexuality and calling it a day (thanks to you guys, I appreciate all the advice in that regard!) but the more I think about it, the more I think that I really am gay, or at least gay-leaning bisexual. It kind of feels like the best time to be realizing it with the gay marriage ruling happening. Every time I think about it I feel giddy.\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Talked it out, sexed it out, we're a couple now! Thanks for helping me stay sane, reddit!",

            "My son is only a little younger than you, and this situation does not surprise me. He and I talk about sexuality, LGBTQ rights and the recent changes in public opinion. Judging from his opinions and the opinions I hear his friends express, I don't believe many in your generation will feel the need to limit their sexuality, or to label everything with hard definitions like \"straight\" or \"gay\". Once you remove the social stigma placed by older generations, people are just people and sexual contact feels good either way. I hope this is true, and as each generation sheds some of the social stigma placed by the previous, I think we can all start getting to know each other and treating each other better. I'm glad that you found resolution in your situation, just know that there are those of us your parents' ages who hope that your generation can step outside some of the hateful behavior that people our own age fall into.  I think more LGBTQ teens are hurt by the social stigma and the backlash that can hit them for being them than they are hurt by confusion over their own identity. \n",

            "Yay! This made me really happy for you. I love it that he got a big grin and lit up like a Christmas tree that must have felt awesome. You both sound really mature for discussing everything out and I'm so happy that these days young people don't have to feel so scared or worried about their sexuality. When I was a teen not even THAT long ago, my gay friend agonised over coming out to anyone else for so long because of social attitudes. It's great how much better things are now.\n\nHave an amazing time with your new bf!",

            "Don't let anyone ever tell you how you should live, if it's okay for them or not, no matter if it is your sister or your parents. You must do what you want, you must do what you feel empowering for yourself. Fuck anti-gays, fuck society, fuck everyone that doesn't accept it. ",

            "About your sister: If she loves you now, she is still going to love you.  She might be weirded out about your relationship.  And she will probably still be convicted that it is wrong.  And she might even be flaky and ignore you for a while but in the long run, she is your sister,s he loves you and she will come around.  I'm a christian and my brother is gay and I never batted an eye when he told me my dad is about 100x more conservative than I am and even he has come around and is friendly with my brother's boyfriend.",
            "Congrats!  Wish you all the best. Very wonderful that you found out young and are able to be yourself.  You both saved several young women from having unhappy, confusing, possibly painful relationships with you by not pretending to be what you aren't.  I respect you guys for your honesty with yourselves and others.\n",
            "I am so excited for you. Honestly, it is a great thing that you have realized this and (hopefully) haven't had to deal with any pain or persecution for your sexuality. Basically, I'm really happy that coming to terms with your sexuality is bringing you happiness instead of pain :)",
            "I had my fingers crossed for you when I opened this up! So glad for you both, take your time and enjoy things at the pace you both want to go at.",
            "Be prepared. I was, am still am, in the same situation as you. Thought I was purely straight, have a best friend who confessed to me, etc. \n\nI have a father that lied to me that he was okay with homosexuality. When I told him, he disowned me. I have a family that does not understand me, especially how I am bisexual, not homosexual. I have the issue of wanting to express myself to others that I'm bisexual, but can't handle the attention or concerns of others, so I never tell anyone. Whenever I talk about my boyfriend, I always say girlfriend.\n\nI'm sure we're not the same, but get ready for your future life now as a bisexual. Congratulations, and have a lovely life. ",
            "Didn't get to comment on the original post but my girlfriend and I saw it and were rooting for you all day, hoping for a good update.  Congrats and I'm so happy this worked out for you!

            "Congrats!\n\nIf you do choose to inform I hope you can do so in a  matter of fact way that does not make you appear to be apologetic or afraid that you are disappointing anyone. With my family I update them about life changes as a courtesy to help them stay informed and not because I need or want their approval. I'm quite close with my Mom and Dad but they know Radio does what Radio wants. My sister is the disapproving sort as well which is why we aren't close. That's her choice though.  ",

The times I've been with guys (bi guy here) and been out and about can feel like that, simply because you hardly see it, which of course is gradually changing. \n\nBonus story: was in Manchester UK last week and there are so many guys out, holding hands and cuddling in public etc. This currently astounds me, and seeing it makes me very happy. It's not something I ever see around where I live, but I can see that changing.",

I understand if you want to tell your parents in a more sit-down fashion, but if you have anyone you're comfortable doing this with, play a game where you and Danny see how much you can act very slightly couple-y around people and see how long it takes them to either realize that you're a couple or make a joke about you two being such good friends that you might as well be a couple... and then just start kissing or something. IDK if you actually wanna do that, but it's also just fun for me personally to imagine that.",
